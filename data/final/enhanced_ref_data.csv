###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Center for Migration, Refugees and Belonging’s \(CMRB\) work produced pioneering evidence of the widespread effects of hostile environment measures. This evidence: 

1.  influenced government’s policy and practice on country\-of\-origin evidence, health\-related immigration and return operations; 

1.  shaped anti\-hostility organisations’ health, education, accommodation, and immigration enforcement campaigns; 

1.  raised national and international evidence\-based understanding; 

1.  upskilled irregular migrants to become cultural producers. 

 Direct and indirect beneficiaries of the research range from forced migrants to racialised communities, and from anti\-hostility campaigning groups to governmental bodies such as the Home Office and the UN. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2010, UK legislation has substantially restricted access to benefits and services for non\-citizens. These multi\-faceted immigration measures, subsumed under the term ‘hostile environment’, were originally targeted at 800,000 \- 1,200.000 unauthorized migrants. However, as early as 2013, CMRB researchers exposed the unforeseen consequences of the policies to society, in particular to racialised people. 

 CMRB’s research was conducted across 16 locations in the UK, France, Italy, Rwanda, and Uganda with 3,331 research participants. The methods comprised of ethnographic observations lasting between 3 and 36 months, 34 focus\-groups with 374 participants, 16 arts workshops with 72 migrants, 2624 survey respondents, and 261 interviews. This research builds on CMRB’s distinctive expertise in intersectional and situated positionality. 

  

 Wemyss and Yuval\-Davis’s EU\-funded project Borders, Intersectionality and the Everyday \( **G1**\) was among the first to identify the effects of the hostile environment beyond its intended targets \- those migrants who have no legal right to reside in the UK. This transformed the nature of civic participation across society despite the public stance of the Government. 

 In 2014, Wemyss, Yuval\-Davis and their research partner coined the terms ‘everyday bordering’ and ‘everyday border guards’ as a lens to clarify the wider societal effects of borders and bordering processes, as they increasingly encroach on people’s lives \( **R1, R2**\). For example, health workers and welfare administrators are required to check the immigration status of all service users and racialised minorities with regular immigration status are denied access to services. Meanwhile, private citizens who are landlords or employers are turned into ‘border guards’ required to check immigration status. 

 Bhattacharyya’s ESRC project, Go Home: mapping immigration controversy, uncovered the racist impact of hostile environment policies, particularly the creation of an increased sense of precarity among racialised minorities independently of their immigration status \( **R3, G2**\). The collaborative street survey gathered the first systematic evidence that Operation Vaken, the Home Office scheme to encourage illegal residents to leave voluntarily, was having adverse effects on racialised minorities with legal settled status. Bhattacharyya’s AHRC Performing Memory upskilled migrant\-led groups in England and Italy to challenge hostile environment policies through cultural production \( **R4, G3**\). 

 CMRB projects address the international ramifications of the UK Government’s hostile environment policies. Wemyss and Yuval\-Davis found that Britain’s ‘everyday bordering’ practices negatively affect by migrants and locals living near the UK border in Calais, France. Doná’s long\-term research on global refugee movements \(R5, G4\) and in conflict countries such as Guatemala, Mexico, Uganda, and Rwanda \( **R6**\), demonstrates how the hostile environment policy is shaped by the conditions in countries of origin and intentional pressures and collaborations.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 2013, CMRB findings have been used to substantially reshape key elements of policy and practice, limiting the effects of different components of hostile environment policies. 

 **1. Improving policy and practice about country\-of\-origin evidence for the Government** 

 Doná was invited to join the influential Independent Advisory Group on Country Information \(IAGCI\) \( **S1**\), whose recommendations are laid before Parliament. One of only ten invited experts, Doná has advised the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration \(ICIBI\) on the content and quality of Home Office country\-of\-origin evidence, which immigration officers rely upon when making case decisions. The evidence Doná provided significantly improvements to the quality of country\-of\-origin evidence produced by the Home Office for 17 additional countries over five years. Home Office policy and practice implemented 13 of 14 key recommendations of the ICIBI 2017 report. By clarifying eligibility for immigration status, Doná played a direct role in regulating the implementation of hostile environment practices at the Home Office. \( **S2**\) 

 **2. Raising awareness of the effects of bordering and shaping campaigning evidence for organisations, politicians, and migrants** 

 The novel concept of ‘everyday bordering’ reached audiences nationally and internationally through the online film Everyday Borders \( **S3a**\) and 36 public debates. Feedback showed that 93% of audiences achieved a greater understanding and 89% were motivated to take action “as a result of attending the event” \( **S3b**\). 

 In 2016, the team were invited to the Houses of Parliament to organise a discussion, Immigration Bills and Everyday Bordering, based on the national and political relevance of the research. Stuart C MacDonald, MP, testifies that “Everyday Bordering is a helpful term … the film shows how it affects all, which Parliament didn’t appreciate … we need to push back. All feel its effects” \( **S3c**\). MPs present subsequently signed the ‘MPs not border\-guards pledge’ in 2018 \( **S3d, S3e**\). 

 CMRB’s concepts shaped understanding and campaigning evidence by migrant health campaign groups in submissions to the Health Select Committee on Data Sharing and the Department of Health and Social Care on charging overseas visitors. ‘Docs Not Cops’ representative, Jess Potter, asserted: 

 *“My campaign work with Medact, Docs Not Cops, Migrants Organise and others and my writing of expert witness statements and policy responses have been strongly influenced by my understanding of the concept of everyday bordering”* \( **S4a**\). 

 Campaign work by Docs Not Cops and other organisations \( **S4b, S4c, S4d**\) use CMRB’s evidence to argue against these policies, resulting in the termination of the NHS Data sharing agreement with the Home Office in 2018 and the suspension in 2020 of the Immigration Health Surcharge. 

 Research findings informed campaigns among formal partners such as Southall Black Sisters on immigration raids \( **S5a**\) and others, including English for Action \( **S5b**\) in collaboration with Against Borders for Children and Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrant's \(JCWI\) campaign against hostile environment ‘Right to Rent’ policy \( **S5c**\). 

 Bhattacharyya’s ‘collaborative memory project’ trained 72 migrants with irregular status to become cultural producers, enabling migrant\-led organisations such as Global Sistaz United to campaign against the hostile environment beyond the scope of the project, at venues including New Arts Exchange, Nottingham in 2018 \( **S6a, S6b**\) and Kack Work Museum in Stockport in 2020 \( **S6c**\). 

 
**3. Underpinning evidence of the racist effects of hostile environment policies for activists and the UN** 

 Figure 1 'Go home' Van 

In 2013, Action against Racism and Xenophobia \(AARX\) was formed with Bhattacharyya to collaboratively gather the first evidence of the negative effects of the ‘Go Home’ vans and Operation Vaken on multi\-ethnic neighbourhoods \( **S7a**\). AARX’s ground\-breaking findings underpinned the successful public challenge by Refugee and Migrants Forum of Essex and London \(RAMFEL\) \( **S7b**\). The public debate \( **S7c**\) sparked by the controversy contributed to the cessation of Operation Vaken and the Home Office review of the impacts of future campaigns on racialised communities and migrants with settled status. \( **S8**\) 

 The pivotal findings resulted in external funding \( **G2, R3**\) to collate systematic evidence in Scotland and Wales. The nationwide evidence, publicly demonstrated in two films and open access resources \( **S9**\), was internationally significant. The UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism in the UK cited the findings in the End of Mission Statement, which was presented to the UN General Assembly as evidence of the racist effects of the hostile environment policies. The report stated that as ‘many members of the wider public have difficulty understanding the distinctions between legal and irregular immigrants’ and “many people reported harassment for being ‘illegal immigrants’ when they held settled status or were British citizens.” \( **S10**\).

This volume, the product of over 20 years of engagement with Rwanda and its diaspora, offers a timely reminder of the necessity of rethinking the genocide’s social history. Examining a range of marginal stories and using Rwanda as a case study, The Marginalised in Genocide Narratives’ analysis of the transformation of genocide into a powerful narrative of a nation establishes an innovative means of understanding the lived spaces of violence and its enduring legacy. In a distinctive approach to the social history of genocide, this book engages with the marginalised; foregrounds genocide’s untold stories; and uses the conceptual framework of the constellation of genocide narratives to create connections among multiple social actors and identify narrative themes that address the unequal power and interdependence of narratives. Adopting a multi-level narrative methodology that addresses the value of multiple narrative framings for understanding genocides, The Marginalised in Genocide Narratives will appeal to students and researchers interested in sociology, conflict and peace studies, history, African studies and narrative research.

<p>This research has created a global programme of language learning initiatives, ‘Language for Resilience’, supported by the British Council. These initiatives have been developed with partners across the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. The principles of this research are used to design and support language teaching programmes which employ trauma-sensitive methods of language learning to build resilience in refugee settings. This has changed how governments, major funding organisations (e.g., the British Council), and NGO’s (e.g., Mercy Corps) approach teaching practices in conflict and post-conflict settings. For example, Mercy Corps in Iraq drew on the pre-existing cultural practices of language teachers and multilingual pedagogies to delivery identity-affirming language programmes to Arabic-speaking displaced people from the south of Iraq, Kurdish-speaking refugees from Syria, and Kurdish-speaking host community students from Kurdistan. The British Council invited researchers to write a FutureLearn Massive Open Online Course: Migrants and Refugees in Education: A Toolkit for Teachers, that reached 7,411 learners in over 130 countries in its first two runs.

<h6>The Searchlight Archive and British Extreme Right Culture</h6>
<p>Dr. Paul Jackson’s research on the extreme right has provided guidance for combatting far right extremism in Britain to professionals, organisations, and the wider public. His main work in based on analysis of historical materials of the Searchlight Archive which documents such extremism since the 1960s, collated by the anti-fascist organisation Searchlight, and available to the public since 2013 through the University of Northampton. This historically informed research was used to create Continuing Professional Development (CPD) tools for institutions and organisations supporting anti-fascist and anti-racist campaigning, such as city councils. The team also contributed to a digitisation project with Gale Cengage (2018-present) to make Searchlight accessible online and raised £10,000 in royalties for Searchlight to put towards its campaigns. The research also contributes to ongoing analysis of developments in extremism for Janes' Terrorism and Insurgency Centre, as well as national and international media outlets to raise public awareness.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The University of Lincoln has led the adoption and development of robotics and autonomous systems to underpin the sustainable intensification of agriculture. Research has influenced the data driven transformation of farming and food production, with UoL’s agricultural robotics  underpinning: **\(1\) changes to policy** \(i\) within the UK, with changes to investment in farming, \(ii\) informing EU policy on agricultural workforces, and \(iii\) informing strategic responses to labour shortfalls arising from COVID and Brexit; and **\(2\) benefits to agricultural business productivity, sustainability, growth and external investment** \(including £9.5M of private sector investment in Saga Robotics, now a world leading agri\-robotic company\) **.**

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The global agri\-food sector is under unprecedented pressure to sustainably intensify and increase productivity whilst reducing its impact on the environment. In addition, the sector’s reliance on seasonal migrant workers for crop harvesting \(69,000 in the UK alone\) is challenged by the combined effects of the COVID\-19 pandemic, changes to UK immigration policy post Brexit and global demographic trends of age and urbanisation. Whilst there is no single panacea to these issues, agricultural robotics and autonomous systems provide vital and emerging opportunities to drive food system resilience. 

 Since 2016, Lincoln has led significant agri\-robotics research that is highly interdisciplinary and co\-created between agriculture and computer science practitioners. Scale of the research is significant, evidenced by UoL winning £18.9M in agri\-robotics research funding since 2016,  including; £6.9M EPSRC AgriForwards CDT \(50 PhD cohort\), £6.3M Research England Expanding Excellence Lincoln Agri Robotics centre \(30 posts including 7 new ECR Lecturers and capital facilities\), 15 IUK collaborative agri\-robotics research awards \(£2.5M value to UoL, plus £5.5M private match funding\), spanning 10 funding calls and working with 29 companies. Research addressed key challenges across a broad body of activity including the integration of robotic technologies into complex agricultural systems, understanding impacts on agricultural workforces, deployment of novel platforms to harvest crops, measure and react to biological diversity. Key research advances to address sector challenges include: 

-  **Crop harvesting robotics**. The £1.6BN UK fresh produce sector is reliant on 69,000  seasonal migrant workers each year to harvest crops. The businesses engaged, who  act as economic anchors across rural UK, employ c.20,000 permanent positions  whilst providing highly nutritious, low carbon fruit and vegetables at accessible prices  to UK society. However, the combined effects of Brexit and COVID\-19 pandemic are  jeopardising the future of this sector of the agricultural economy \(EFRA Select  Committee Report, Dec 2020\). Robotic and autonomous systems that selectively  harvest labour dependent crops, such as broccoli and strawberries, offer an  emerging opportunity to drive labour productivity, but these systems rely on novel  technologies that can detect \(in 3D\), measure and manipulate key crop components  within highly diverse biological systems. Research at Lincoln has pioneered the  development of such vision systems to underpin robotic harvesting, with foundational  research **\[3.1\]** demonstrating how low\-cost 3D cameras can be used for high speed  and robust image recognition in commercial crops. Results showed that purely  technical/robotic solutions \(image recognition for harvesting\) are unlikely to be  successful without a full appreciation of the biology / variability of a crop and within  an agricultural system. This foundational publication led to a larger body of research  at Lincoln on crop vision technologies, including the underpinning detection system  **\[3.2\]** subsequently deployed as a prototype robotic strawberry platform and  harvester. 

-  **Environmental monitoring of soils**. Existing agricultural soil management practices  are widely accepted as unsustainable, with reliance on high mass agricultural  machines compacting soils, energy intensive cultivation leading to unacceptable soil  carbon emissions and inefficient use of critical resources such as water. Effective  farmer decision support for soil management is only possible through improved soil  monitoring, measurement and mapping, yet existing technologies were highly labour  dependent, expensive and subject to sampling errors. UoL has led foundational  research on the application of robotics for soil mapping, including new algorithms for  efficient soil mapping and sensors to detect soil moisture \(first agricultural  demonstration of a cosmic neutron rover\) and compaction **\[3.2, 3.3\]** 

-  **Barriers to adoption**. UoL has conducted theoretical assessments of how robotic  systems might be scaled across agriculture **\[3.4\]** and change the nature of work  **\[3.5, 3.6\].** These studies demonstrated socio\-economic barriers to the deployment of  robotics in agriculture, including impacts on the existing workforce and economic  challenges to transition conventional systems, reliant on few high mass machines  \(diesel powered tractors\), towards a new operational paradigm underpinned by fleets  of smaller electric robotic platforms.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 UoL’s innovative agri\-food research has underpinned a series of impacts for the agricultural sector, with activity including a series of strategic engagements with government, industry and the production of a pivotal white paper **\[5.1\].** UoL’s research materially contributed to the development of a cohesive national strategy for agri\-robotics resulting in **\(1\) changes to policy** \(i\) within the UK, enhancing investment in farming, \(ii\) within the EU, informing policy on agricultural workforces, and \(iii\) informing UK strategic responses to labour shortfalls arising from COVID and Brexit; and *\(2\)* **benefits to agricultural business** productivity, sustainability, growth and external investment. 

1.  **Impacts on policy** 

 i. **Changes to UK Government policy and investment in farming** 

 As a consequence of the scale and significance of UoL’s research, Pearson was  invited by Sir Peter Kendal to chair the Robotics and AI Task and Finish Group  \(TFG\) reporting to the Agricultural Productivity Working Group \(APWG\) of the  DEFRA/BEIS Food Sector Council.  The TFG report **\[5.2\]**, which included evidence  from the UoL body of research on selective harvesting articulated the challenges,  timelines and government support for accelerated adoption of robotics by UK  farmers and formed part of the APWG’s report to the Sector Council in 2019 **\[5.3\]** .   Recommendations directly reflected critical lessons from UoL research \[particularly  3.2\] that adoption of agri\-robotics technologies requires scaled interdisciplinary  research at a full systems level;  this included the recommendation that the UK  government should invest in infrastructure to support the roll\-out of robotics  \( *Recommendation 5*, focused on 5G and data infrastructure\) and that UK research  policy should increase focus on collaborative, mission\-led approaches  \( *Recommendation 3,* which includes robotics\). This APWG report informed  government policy, seen in the DEFRA Future for Framing Report, 2020 **\[5.4\]**,  particularly with the new Farming Transformation Fund **\[5.4\],** that provides grants to  farms for large scale investments in research and infrastructure, specifically allowing  payment for “ *increasing the use of automation and robotics”*. 

 ii. **Informed EU policy on the future of agricultural workforces** 

 UoL research informed EU policy, where a commissioned report for the AGRI  committee of the EU Parliament **\[5.5\]** cited Lampridi *et al* \[reference 3.4\] and  Marinoudi *et al* \[3.5\] to substantiate hypotheses that robotics will change the nature  of work within EU agriculture. Reflecting key learning from UoL research, one of the  reports key conclusions was that *“the challenge for farmers to take up such*  *innovation should not be under\-estimated, hence the importance of vocational*  *training, advisory services and knowledge exchange within and outside the*  *framework of the CAP”* **\[5.5,** page 103\] *.*  EU Parliament AGRI committee  recommendations are pivotal for strategic reviews of the new Green Deal and CAP  transition policy. 

 iii. **Informing policy responses to the protection of farming businesses incurring**   **staff shortfalls arising from COVID and Brexit.** 

 In 2020, as part of an urgent COVID\-19 response, UoL with the National Farmers  Union and the Innovate UK Agri\-EPI centre created and led the national “Accelerated  Automation” initiative. UoL’s leadership role was a direct consequence of its body of  research on agri\-robotics and initiated after discussions \(minuted with EPSRC\) with  the industrial steering board of AgriForwards CDT.  The objective was to complete  and scale emerging robotic technologies to mitigate serious shortfalls in farm labour  as an immediate consequence of COVID\-19 pandemic, as well as medium term  impacts of changes to migration policy post Brexit. This national consultation  engaged over 100 different companies and organisations across the fresh produce  and robotics sectors. It focussed on establishing whether fast track robotic  development and scaling could resolve critical shortfalls in labour supply. Pearson  reported this in written evidence to the EFRA Select Committees on “COVID\-19 and  food supply” and “Labour in the food supply chains” **\[5.6\].** Throughout the  Accelerated Automation process, UoL and Agri\-EPI have actively engaged with  government \(up to Ministerial level\).

 2\) **Benefits to agricultural business productivity, sustainability, growth and external investment.** 

 Saga Robotics Ltd \( [https://sagarobotics.com/](https://sagarobotics.com/)\) is a world leading agri\-robotic start\-up manufacturing agricultural robots and providing roboticised services to the farming industry to address key challenges including labour shortages and the sustainability of food production. Their flagship product is Thorvald, a universal, modular mobile platform which can be deployed in many different agricultural scenarios such as crop care, selective harvesting or in\-field transportation. In addition to direct sales, the company operates a Farming\-as\-a\-Service \(FaaS\) business model, offering prototype robotic fruit picking \(using UoL’s image analysis system\) and commercial autonomous UVC light treatments to reduce powdery mildew on fruit crops in the UK, USA and Norway. Since developing their first robotic system hardware in 2016 in Norway, Saga have actively collaborated with UoL on research\-led developments for their software systems and agricultural domain applications for fruit picking, pest control, logistics support, robotic weeding, crop forecasting \[reference 3.2\]. The enhanced software system directly includes critical applications developed with Lincoln, including 3D image recognition systems for fruit picking \[reference 3.1\] and robotic mapping technologies \[references 3.3. and 3.4, stored in extensive shared GiThuB libraries hosted on UoL servers\]. Collaboration with SAGA was directly facilitated by Professor Pal From \(Saga CEO\) who was an embedded and 25% FTE Chair of Agri\-Robotics at UoL from 2017 to 2021. 

 The collaboration with UoL has resulted in changes to Saga’s business model, leading to growth in both capacity and external investment. Saga made a strategic decision to open its UK office on the University Campus in 2016, where the company currently now employs 21 full\-time highly skilled staff, with 3 senior software engineers originating from the UoL team. Saga cite UoL’s research as a key contributing factor to securing £9.5M of Series A venture capital funding to accelerate and scale up the company **\[5.7\]**. 

 Beyond Saga, UoL’s agri\-robotics research has enabled a range of novel and step\-changing solutions for major food producers.  Berry Garden Growers, the UK’s leading berry and stone fruit production with a market share over 30% and annual sales of over £300 million, report that using the UoL\-enhanced Thorvald system has yielded both economic and environmental benefits: 

 *“The deployment of this robotic fleet at Clockhouse Farm in 2020 successfully demonstrated full robotic autonomy, 7km per robot per night deployed, for UVC robots over a whole season. This is a global first, robotic technologies from UoL have transformed our research investment, estimated at £1.2M, over the last 3 years”.* **\[5.8\].** 

 **Similar findings are reported by one of the largest farms in Norway, Myhrene AS, who in 2020 switched completely to spraying\-free production on strawberries across their 5ha polytunnel production, using the UoL\-enhanced Thorvald system. Simen A. Myhrene, Chairman of Myhrene states that **""With the  robot we get less energy consumption, a better overview over the production, we can use less pesticides, we can save more labour, we take better care of the soil which again give bigger crops. There are so many effects we can gain when we learn how to use this \- it’s here to stay\!""** \[5.7\].**

The paper evaluates different 3D features, machine learning, and temporal filtering methods for detection of broccoli heads. Our experiments show that a combination of Viewpoint Feature Histograms, Support Vector Machine classifier, and a temporal filter to track the detected heads results in a system that detects broccoli heads with high precision. We also show that the temporal filtering can be used to generate a 3D map of the broccoli head positions in the field. Additionally, we present methods for automatically estimating the size of the broccoli heads, to determine when a head is ready for harvest. All of the methods were evaluated using ground‐truth data from both the UK and Spain, which we also make available to the research community for subsequent algorithm development and result comparison.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Depression is a common mental health disorder that runs a recurrent, relapsing course. Affecting more than 264 million people worldwide, depression is a major contributor to the global burden of disease \(WHO, 2020\). Professor Teasdale, Dr Dalgleish and colleagues developed Mindfulness\-Based Cognitive Therapy \(MBCT\) as an effective and cost\-effective alternative to medication in the prevention of depressive relapse and recurrence, without the side\-effects associated with antidepressants. Over 10,000 patients in the UK have benefited from MBCT, and through international training it is now available in \~200 clinics in the USA reaching around 6000 patients annually. MBCT is included in professional guidelines in North America, Australasia, and Europe, and has been extended to multiple health conditions and social domains including prisons, education and the workplace.

 **2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\)** 

 Depressive disorders are a primary cause of disability in the UK, with up to one in 10 adults experiencing depression in any given week. Depression runs a relapsing and recurrent course across the lifespan and consequently imposes an enormous annual cost to the taxpayer in lost productivity, lost earnings and benefit dependence, estimated to rise to GBP12 billion in the next decade \(McCrone et al, 2008\). 

 There are a number of effective interventions for depression recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\). However, even the best of these delivers clinical remission in only around half of patients. The risks of relapse are also high, with at least 50% of those who recover from a first depressive episode having one or more additional episodes in their lifetime; approximately 80% of those with a history of two episodes having another recurrence \(American Psychiatric Association, 2000\). The magnitude of the social and economic challenge posed by current levels of depression indicates that a reactive ‘treatment’ model alone cannot address present needs, and so concerted efforts have been made to develop preventive approaches. 

 In 2000, Professor John Teasdale at the Medical Research Council’s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit \(CBU\) in Cambridge along with colleagues in Bangor \(Mark Williams\) and Toronto \(Zindel Segal\) developed mindfulness based cognitive therapy \(MBCT\), integrating mindfulness techniques with elements of cognitive therapy, developed by Aaron T. Beck in the 1960s. MBCT was created to prevent the relapse and recurrence of depression, thereby pioneering the application of mindfulness approaches to the domain of mental health \[1\]. 

 MBCT is a group\-based intervention that enhances cognitive control over emotional information by cultivating the ability to psychologically ‘step back’ from distressing mental content, reframe it, and return attention to more neutral content \[2\]. It focuses on preventing relapse in currently well patients with recurrent depression. Initial randomised controlled trial \(RCT\) evidence led from the CBU \[1,3\] supported the efficacy of MBCT for depression prevention. 

 Large\-scale definitive RCTs were still lacking so, along with Willem Kuyken and colleagues in Exeter, in 2015 Dr Dalgleish completed the first definitive RCT \[4\] comparing MBCT against an active control intervention – maintenance anti\-depressants \(the PREVENT trial; *N*=424\) \[4\]. Depressive relapse rates were comparable for both treatments, indicating that MBCT represents an important psychosocial alternative to maintenance medication for recurrent depression. This was corroborated in a large data synthesis of all existing MBCT RCTs by Dr Dalgleish, Professor Teasdale and Professor Kuyken supporting MBCT as a frontline preventive intervention for depression, that offers no risk of side\-effects \[5\]. 

 MBCT\-based programmes have now been extended to multiple health conditions and settings \(as outlined in the impact section below\) as a broad prophylactic intervention for mental distress.  In one such extension led by Cambridge, Professor Peter Jones in the Psychiatry Dept. at  the University of Cambridge completed an NIHR\-funded pragmatic RCT \(The Mindful Student Study; *N*=616\) \[6\] showing that an MBCT\-based programme increased resilience to stress during the examinations period, compared to support\-as\-usual in university students.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Cambridge University research has had a significant and far\-reaching impact on the lives of patients with depression worldwide. Beneficiaries include patients, health service providers, mental health workers, and the wider society through the economic benefits of reduced welfare costs and increased employment and productivity. The impact of MBCT nationally and internationally now extends beyond depression to other psychiatric and physical health conditions, and beyond the healthcare domain to education, the workplace, and the criminal justice system. 

 **Inclusion of MBCT in professional guidelines worldwide**The weight of evidence in favour of MBCT as a psychosocial preventive intervention for depression and as an alternative to maintenance medication has led to its inclusion in UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) guidance since 2004. In 2017, the NICE updated consultation document extended the recommendations around MBCT, based on Cambridge University research \(citing \[1,3,4\]\), to advocate MBCT as a relapse prevention alternative for those who want to come off of medication: “ *Offer group CBT*\[cognitive behavioural therapy\] *\(or MBCT for those who have had 3 or more previous episodes of depression\) for preventing relapse to people who are assessed as being at higher risk of relapse and who recovered with medication but who want to stop taking it”* \[A\]\). 

 MBCT is also included as a frontline prevention for depressive relapse in other international guidelines referencing Cambridge University research, e.g. Belgium \(2016\), Canada, Australia and New Zealand and the USA \[B\]. Clinical practice guidelines for mood disorders from the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists \(2015\) recommend that “ *MBCT or CBT should be offered as a relapse prevention intervention, particularly amongst patients with recurrent depressive episodes*”. Guidelines for the management of adults with major depressive disorder from the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments \(2016\)\[B\-iii\] recommend MBCT “ *as sequential first\-line treatment after a course of antidepressants, and as a secondline alternative to long\-term maintenance antidepressant treatment*”. Guidance from the American Psychological Association Guideline for the Treatment of Depression \(2019\) \[B\-v\] recommends MBCT as a first line adult treatment as one of several evidence\-based approaches. 

 **Impact on the UK health service** 

 In November 2013, the Mindfulness Initiative was founded to support British politicians in forming the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Mindfulness \(MAPPG\). In their *Mindful Nation UK 2015* report, the MAPPG recommended national roll\-out of MBCT across the UK NHS for the 580,000 sufferers of recurrent depression each year in need of treatment, stating that “ *Mindfulness\-Based interventions \(MBIs\) have a unique role to play in addressing the health challenges facing the country”* \[C\]. 

 Following these recommendations, in 2017, Health Education England \(HEE\) commissioned training to make MBCT more accessible within the NHS \[D\]. This led to the first UK\-wide training programme for MBCT therapists in the national NHS Improving Access to Psychological Therapies \(IAPT\) Programme. It was led by Sussex Mindfulness Centre \(SMC\), in partnership with the Nottingham Centre for Mindfulness, the University of Exeter, Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust and the Oxford Mindfulness Centre \[D\]. Since 2018 the regional providers have completed MBCT training for a total of 615 people, including 165 IAPT professsionals\[E\]. The inclusion of MBCT nationwide as a frontline intervention within the NHS IAPT programme alone between 2015 and 2020 has seen more than 10,000 patients benefit from MBCT\[Dii\]. 

 Courses to train clinicians in MBCT techniques are now available internationally,  including in Hong Kong, the USA, Canada, Europe, and China \[F\] with an internationally agreed set of training criteria outlined in a report referencing the underpinning research \[G\]. As of December 2020, there are now 200 clinics in North America that deliver MBCT face\-to\-face for the prevention of depression, reaching around 6000 patients a year\[F\]. 

 **Economic impact** 

 Depression is estimated to cost the UK GBP9.19 billion a year in lost earnings, and is forecast to cost the NHS GBP2.96 billion in the next decade. The NICE 2017 Consultation Document to update the 2009 guidelines concluded that MBCT is the most cost\-effective option for severely affected patients. *“In people at high risk of relapse who have remitted following acute psychological treatment and who are expected to experience more severe depression if they relapse, clinical management appears to be the most cost\-effective option ..In sensitivity analysis that included group CT and MBCT, MBCT became the most cost\-effective option*”\[A\]. Similar evidence of the cost\-effectiveness for MBCT has been gathered internationally \[Fii\]. 

 **Broader health impact of MBCT beyond depression** 

 Since August 2013, good supporting evidence has emerged from randomised controlled trials supporting MBCT’s or adapted\-MBCT’s therapeutic benefits for other psychiatric conditions including Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder \[H\].Trial evidence also supports MBCT’s efficacy in alleviating psychological and physical symptoms for a number of physical health conditions including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease \(COPD\), and irritable bowel syndrome \[H\]. Evidence also now supports extension of MBCT as a healthcare intervention to an online delivery format \[H\]. 

 **Impact beyond the healthcare system** 

 The MAPPG also recommended an evaluation of MBCT\-derived interventions for adults in non\-clinical settings such as the workplace, the criminal justice system and education \[C\]. 

 In 2016 the Mindfulness Initiative published *‘Building the case for Mindfulness in the Workplace’* \[I\-i\] which reported that programmes based on MBCT have an increasing impact within work and other adult non\-clinical settings.  Emerging data, including a systematic review and meta\-analysis led from Cambridge involving Professor Jones and Dr Dalgleish, supports MBCT’s beneficial effects on critical work indicators such as reduced risk of drop out, as well as the expected reductions in stress and associated mental health problems \[I\-ii\]. 

 MBCT was introduced into the UK prison service in 2017, initially at HMP Pentonville but now extended to eight other prisons nationally. The prison programmes have three elements: \(i\) to reduce staff stress,\(ii\) as a mental health intervention for inmates, and \(iii\) to provide staff training as MBCT practioners \[I\-iii\]. In Autumn 2016, 21 staff members \(including occupational therapists, clinical psychologists and mental health nurses\) undertook the 8 week training programme, of whom 17 continued to undertake full MBCT training. As a result one prison now offers six MBCT groups with an average of six men in each group. A pilot project with prisoners was found to be effective – the average participant rated the course as 8.8/10. From one prisoner “ *‘It has helped me in steadying myself when things are rushing in my head\- concentrating on me now rather than could be or has been.’* 

 Within the education domain, Cambridge University research \[6\] showing that an MBCT\-based programme confers resilience to exam stress in students at Cambridge has led to approximately 2,100 Cambridge students \(14 courses for 30 students run/year\) going through the programme since 2015,  which has also been disseminated and trialled internationally at institutions in France and Finland, with further interest from Chile and the United States \[I\-iv\]. 

 Finally, popular self\-help guides  and workbooks on MBCT for depression have emerged from the underpinning research: *The Mindful Way through Depression*; Williams et al., 2007; *The Mindful Way Workbook*; Teasdale et al., 2014; and *Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Finding Peace in a Frantic World*; Williams & Penman, 2011\), that have variously been translated into over a dozen languages. Combined they have sold over 1,280,000 copies worldwide \[J\].

<p>The period after discharge from a mental health facility is associated with the highest risk of suicide and self-harm in adolescent mental health clients, due to a lack of social support and effective treatment upon discharge. Supported Discharge Service (SDS) was set up to fill this gap. SDS offers detailed assessment and evidence-based, individual, group and family treatment without significant disruption to education, family or leisure. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of SDS has contributed to a shift away from inpatient treatment to an intensive community service delivery for longer term and more cost-effective results (average of £3,700 per patient). NHS England has now allocated £50,000,000 to post-discharge support for these patients. SDS has received international interest, with German adoption under the name ‘Hot-BITs’ (Home Treatment Brings Inpatient Treatments outside), with estimated treatment cost saving of over EUR 6,000 per patient.

<h6>Improving the management of physical health in people with severe mental illness in the UK NHS and internationally</h6>
<p>This research identified the widening mortality gap for people with severe mental illness (SMI) and led to efforts to improve the management of physical health in people with severe mental illness in the UK NHS and internationally. This research has contributed to the development of new prediction tools and management strategies for people with severe mental illness (SMI) that have been adopted across the NHS, such as the use of the Lester tool for cardiovascular screening. This research led to the inclusion of annual cardiovascular screening for all patients with SMI as a central principal of the NHS 2019 Long Term Plan. It was fundamental to the development of a RightCare pathway for people with SMI in local health systems in England -- recommending use of the PRIMROSE intervention, an evidence-based, nurse-led service. It has also driven new guidelines worldwide on the need to effectively manage physical health among people with SMI, including The American Association Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Schizophrenia (2019), The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (2018), the physical health of people with severe mental illness (Ireland’s Mental Health Commission, 2018), and the Excess Mortality in Persons with Severe Mental Disorders (2016).

<h6>Sleeping on it: using history to understand and address today's 'sleep crisis'</h6>
<p>Partnered with the National Trust (NT) in a public programming project to provide a series of exhibitions, workshops, outreach events, films, blog posts, and staff training exercises to bring public attention to the ‘sleep crisis’ and offer information and solutions based on historical research of how we used to sleep. The Tudor properly, Little Moreton Hall (LMH), hosted the bulk of the programme of events. 79,000 visitors in 2017 participated in the ‘Sleep Walk’ that demonstrated historic bedtime routines, bi-phasic sleep patterns, and sleep remedies. An increase in the number of visitors from 76,000 to 79,000 in 2017 was attributed to this attraction. The success of this partnership contributed to the NT being awarded the status of Independent Research Organisation by the AHRC on behalf of UKRI in 2019. The Children’s Sleep Charity and the British Academy partnered with ICS researchers to repurpose the educational materials developed through the NT outreach and events to engage school communities, comparing past and present healthcare strategies in relation to sleep and wellbeing, and improving public understanding of sleep’s importance for physical and mental health. The partnership with the CSC achieved the Foundation for Social Impact Award for ‘Small Charity, Big Achiever’, and the Royal Society for Public Health Award for ‘Children and Young People’.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Bovine tuberculosis \(bTB\) is a global disease that is economically draining to control and threatens human health. Research at the University of Cambridge has directly informed policy decisions relating to the control and surveillance programmes of bTB in the UK and Ethiopia. The research sculpted the future direction of vaccination policy and delayed the implementation of cattle vaccination in the UK, which saved at least GBP120,000,000 of public money. The work has also led to improved surveillance of bTB  in English slaughterhouses. Through sustained engagement and collaboration, Cambridge research has contributed to greater availability of high quality bTB testing in Ethiopia, through specially trained staff and testing teams, and establishment of the country’s first ministerial group to lead national efforts in overcoming bTB. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Bovine tuberculosis \(bTB\) is a significant bacterial disease in the UK and globally. It is infectious and contagious, with two main reservoirs \(cattle and badgers\). The disease threatens the cattle industry and presents risks to other livestock, wildlife and domestic pets. bTB in animals can also threaten human health, although the widespread pasteurisation of cows’ drinking milk and milk products largely protects the public from undisclosed cases of bTB in cattle \(source: UK Government Animal and Plant Health Agency, online\). Globally, no bTB vaccine is licensed for use in cattle. The problem is that at present it is impossible to distinguish between a vaccinated and TB\-infected cow and a positive result in the standard diagnostic skin test acts as the legal definition of a TB infection, even if induced by vaccination. 

 **Modelling the suitability of cattle vaccination as a supplement to existing test\-and\-slaughter control** 

 Conlan and Wood have worked closely with bTB policy teams in Defra since 2007 with a series of Defra\-funded projects; since 2012 they have developed mathematical models for the transmission of bTB within herds in Great Britain, providing a shift in the level of statistical rigour applied to policy approaches and offering insights into the epidemiology of bTB. These models were used to publish the first estimates of cattle\-to\-cattle transmission of bTB in the UK \[R1\]. 

 Between 2011 and 2013, the cattle\-to\-cattle transmission models developed by Conlan and Wood were extended to explore cattle vaccination as a supplement to existing test\-and\-slaughter control. Vaccination is known to interfere with the standard diagnostic tests for bTB because it is impossible to tell whether a positive result is due to the vaccine or a true infection. There was an acknowledged need for a test that Distinguishes Infected from Vaccinated Animals \(DIVA\); none are currently licenced. 

 Developing cattle vaccination is central to UK government strategy for bTB control. However, under current national and international trading regulations the UK government will only consider vaccination as a supplement, rather than a replacement, to test\-and\-slaughter. Most of the economic costs associated with bTB in the UK come from testing and restrictions, rather than disease losses, therefore Conlan and Wood’s models demonstrated that there was no economic benefit of vaccination without an accurate DIVA test \[R2\]. 

 Subsequently, in 2014 Conlan and Wood were part of a Defra\-funded tender led by Triveritas management \(a commercial organisation providing veterinary good clinical practice regulatory studies\) to calculate the size and scale of field trials necessary to satisfy the EU’s requirements for allowing use of a cattle vaccine. The models showed that demonstrating a protective benefit from the vaccine in individual cattle could be achieved by a trial of \~100 herds.  However, satisfying the EU’s requirement that trials could estimate an impact of vaccination on reducing transmission of infection would require far larger, and frankly unaffordable, trials \(of the order of \~1000 herds\). As an invited member of a follow\-on working group, Conlan developed cheaper experimental designs to evaluate this key requirement from the EU, namely a three arm design which includes fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated control herds \[R3\]. 

 **Operational models to rank the effectiveness of slaughterhouse surveillance for bTB in Great Britain** 

 In 2018 Conlan, Wood and collaborators developed the first operationalised model to rank the effectiveness of slaughterhouse surveillance for bTB in Great Britain \[R4\]. The model identified large geographic variations in the effectiveness of slaughterhouse surveillance and offered the ability to prioritise further investigation to slaughterhouses that had unusually high or low rates of bTB. 

 **Bovine tuberculosis in Ethiopia** 

 Since 2014, Conlan and Wood have led major programmes of underpinning research on the epidemiology, spread and control, including social and political aspects, of bTB in Ethiopia using mathematical modelling and analyses of whole genome sequences of *Mycobacterium bovis* from cattle and humans. Their research has demonstrated that the prevalence is high, if highly variable between regions, with a herd prevalence of 22.4% \(95% CI: 17\-29%\) outside Addis Ababa in Ethiopia \[R5\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Bovine tuberculosis is a substantial economic and animal welfare problem. The UK government spends \~GBP100 million annually on bTB control, with costs to industry estimated to be a further GBP50 million \[E1, page 13\]. As a member of OIE \(World Organisation for Animal Health\), the UK is required to have a bTB eradication plan. Modelling work undertaken at the University of Cambridge has led to the following impact: 

 **Influencing high\-level policy direction in the UK** 

 Conlan and Wood have engaged closely with government advisory bodies that formulate or challenge government policy in England: Wood as part of Defra’s TB Eradication Advisory Committee the independent review committee in 2018, chaired by Professor Sir Charles Godfray \[E2\], and Conlan on a group examining vaccination strategies. In 2014, their research was cited as part of the evidence for the government’s epidemiological rationale in the Defra’s Strategy for achieving Officially Bovine Tuberculosis Free status for England \[E3, page 57\], which rejected a “one size fits all approach” and set targets to measure progress. Wood’s research was also cited in a Parliamentary debate on 13 March 2014 by a Liberal Democrat MP, highlighting the issue of latent TB in cattle and suggesting a change in focus regarding strategies \[E4\]. At this point, badger culling as a means to tackle TB was not seen as publicly acceptable, with the government looking to vaccination as a desirable alternative. 

 **Changes to vaccination strategy in England** 

 Conlan and Wood’s evaluation of BCG vaccination in cattle \(R2\) suggested that field trials would have to be on a massive scale, but at the point when Defra commissioned their analysis in 2014, led by Triveritas, extensive field trials were still expected to start in 2015. This was in line with the 2014 Strategy for achieving Officially Bovine Tuberculosis Free status for England, in which the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committed to an investment of GBP24.6 million in the development of effective TB vaccines for both cattle and badgers \[E3\]. The Triveritas study estimated that the cost of the field trial then proposed would be as much as GBP120,000,000, with additional costs of \[text removed for publication\] for implementing any vaccination programme \[E5\]. 

 These results had an immediate impact on Defra policy: to indefinitely delay implementation of cattle vaccination. This saved public money through stopping impossibly large field efficacy trials and through providing clear evidence that DIVA tests had to be improved before vaccination could be rolled out. It also prompted a longer\-term change of focus on the <ins>specificity \(the ability to detect a true negative\)</ins> of the replacement DIVA test, rather than sensitivity <ins>\(the ability to</ins> <ins>detect a true positive\)</ins>, which had previously been the priority \[E1\]. In a statement on 18 December 2014, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said, “\[The\] report…shows that before cattle vaccination field trials can be contemplated, we need to develop a better DIVA test. This research is likely to take a further two years.” \[E6\] 

 The senior policy adviser from Defra’s Bovine TB Programme states that the evaluation report, and Conlan and Wood’s 2015 paper \(R2\), *“contributed to a change of emphasis from vaccination assessment to the validation of new diagnostic \(DIVA\) tests. By understanding the scale of trial needed to confirm efficacy, we were able to prevent costly, complex action that would not have resulted in demonstrable lowering of disease. In real terms, this translates as preventing government expenditure and saving an estimated* \[text removed for publication\] *of public money.”* \[E7\] 

 The 2018 Bovine TB strategy review \[E2\] cited Wood and Conlan’s research, noting that *“Existing surveillance regimes underestimate the prevalence of the disease in cattle in England and this hinders control.”* \[E2, page 32, cites \(R1\)\] 

 It goes on to say: “ *The* \[EU\] *Commission indicated the necessity of field trials... However, to obtain sufficient statistical power using this approach would likely require, given the prevalence of bovine TB in England, large\-scale field trials which might involve 500 farms over 2 years. This may be unfeasible and equivalent information might be obtained more easily using vaccination and challenge experimentation with approximately 200 individual Animals*.”\[E2, page 44, cites \(R3\)\]. 

 The Government response in March 2020 recognised that *“performance of the DIVA test is crucial in enabling BCG vaccination to realise disease control benefits. As well as identifying vaccinated cattle that are truly infected, it is essential that the DIVA test has a high specificity... Field trial designs have been developed to further evaluate the cattle BCG vaccine and DIVA skin test and provide the evidence required for applications for* \[Marketing Authorisations\] *to be submitted and for the DIVA test to be internationally recognised.*” \[E1, page 23\] 

 The Defra senior adviser confirms that *“Research from the University of Cambridge…has played a key role in government understanding of key factors involved in building a diagnostic and vaccination policy for bovine TB, and has directly influenced decisions that have had an important impact on public spending.”* \[E7\] 

 **Identification of slaughterhouses with low rates of bTB detection** 

 The model of slaughterhouse surveillance \(R4\) was transferred to the Animal and Plant Health Agency \(APHA\), responsible for bTB control, resulting in implementation of new professional practice to monitor bTB levels. It is run on an annual basis to identify slaughterhouses with unexpectedly low rates of bTB detection, which need further investigation. The Data Systems Group Workgroup Leader at APHA says that this is now an “integral part” of reporting to Defra and enables them to “identify any poor performing slaughterhouses \(in terms of their inability to identify bTB infected animals\)” \[E8\]. The Godfray review also cited the research, noting the need for *“raising awareness of its importance with slaughterhouse workers, financial incentives for good practice and more frequent inspection.”* \[E2, 3.35, page 38\]. 

 **Introduction of new bTB policy in Ethiopia** 

 In Ethiopia, where the bTB burden is very high in dairy cattle, Wood has been instrumental in the establishment of a steering group, chaired by the Ethiopian state minister, on bTB control; no similar body has existed before. By engaging in a series of focus group discussions with farmers, veterinarians and human health workers in two sites in Ethiopia, Conlan, Wood and collaborators were able to show the need for investment in animal health system strengthening in Ethiopia \[E9\]. The terms of reference of this Ministerial group in Ethiopia include that it be chaired by the State Minister to lead on national efforts to coordinate control at the national and regional level, a highly significant symbol in the centralised Ethiopian government system. The controls now being developed have a firm base in the work published from the Cambridge related programmes \(R5\). There is now much greater availability of high quality bTB testing, through specially trained staff and testing teams in the government agency National Animal Health and Diagnostic Investigation Centre \(NAHDIC\), which regularly offers advice to farmers around disease control \[E9\].

The potential use of vaccination within the European Union has been linked to a need for field evaluation of any prospective vaccine and the impact of vaccination on the rate of transmission of bTB. We calculate that estimation of the direct protection of BCG could be achieved with 100 herds, but over 500 herds would be necessary to demonstrate an economic benefit for farmers whose costs are dominated by testing and associated herd restrictions. However, the low and variable attack rate in GB herds means field trials are unlikely to be able to discern any impact of vaccination on transmission.

We explore patterns in the numbers of herd breakdowns detected through slaughterhouse surveillance and develop a Bayesian hierarchical regression model to assess the associations of animal-level factors with the odds of an infected animal being detected in the slaughterhouse, allowing us to highlight slaughterhouses that show atypical patterns of detection. The analyses demonstrate that the numbers and proportions of breakdowns detected in slaughterhouses increased in GB over the period of study (1998-2013). The odds of an animal being a slaughterhouse case was strongly associated with the region of the country that the animal spent most of its life, with animals living in high-frequency testing areas of England having on average 21 times the odds of detection compared to animals living in Scotland. There was also a strong effect of age, with animals slaughtered at > 60 months of age having 5.3 times the odds of detection compared to animals slaughtered between 0-18 months of age. Smaller effects were observed for cattle having spent time on farms with a history of bTB, quarter of the year that the animal was slaughtered, movement and test history. Over-and-above these risks, the odds of detection increased by a factor of 1.1 for each year of the study. After adjustment for these variables, there were additional variations in risk between slaughterhouses and breed.

suspected presence of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has progressively increased over the past 25 years despite an intensive and costly test-and-slaughter control program. Around 38% of herds that clear movement restrictions experience a recurrent incident (breakdown) within 24 months, suggesting that infection may be persisting within herds. Reactivity to tuberculin, the basis of diagnostic testing, is dependent on the time from infection. Thus, testing efficiency varies between outbreaks, depending on weight of transmission and cannot be directly estimated. In this paper, we use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to parameterize two within-herd transmission models within a rigorous inferential framework. Previous within-herd models of bTB have relied on ad-hoc methods of parameterization and used a single model structure (SORI) where animals are assumed to become detectable by testing before they become infectious. We study such a conventional within-herd model of bTB and an alternative model, motivated by recent animal challenge studies, where there is no period of epidemiological latency before animals become infectious (SOR). Under both models we estimate that cattle-to-cattle transmission rates are non-linearly density dependent. The basic reproductive ratio for our conventional within-herd model, estimated for scenarios with no statutory controls, increases from 1.5 (0.26-4.9; 95% CI) in a herd of 30 cattle up to 4.9 (0.99-14.0) in a herd of 400. Under this model we estimate that 50% (33-67) of recurrent breakdowns in Britain can be attributed to infection missed by tuberculin testing. However this figure falls to 24% (11-42) of recurrent breakdowns under our alternative model.

""Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) has become an economically important disease in dairy herds found in and around Addis Ababa City and is emerging in regional cities like Gondar, Hawassa and Mekelle because of the establishment of dairy farms in the milk sheds of these cities. A cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of BTB and identify associated risk factors was conducted between February 2016 and March 2017. A total of 174 herds comprising of 2,754 dairy cattle in the cities of Gondar, Hawassa and Mekelle were tested using the Single Intradermal Comparative Cervical Tuberculin (SICCT) test. Data on herd structure, animal origin, body condition, housing condition, farm hygiene, management and biosecurity practices were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used to analyze the herd and animal level risk factors, respectively. The herd prevalence was 22.4% (95% CI: 17-29%) while the animal prevalence was 5.2% (95% CI: 4-6%) at the cut-off >4\\u2009mm. The herd prevalence rose to 65.5% (95% CI: 58-72%) and the animal prevalence rose to 9% (95% CI: 8-10%) when the severe interpretation of >2\\u2009mm cut-off was applied. The mean within-herd prevalence in positive farms at the cut-off >4\\u2009mm was 22.7% (95% CI: 15-31%). At the herd level, the analysis showed that herd size, farm hygiene, feeding condition and biosecurity were significantly associated with BTB status, while new cattle introductions showed only borderline significance and that age of farm, housing condition, farmers\' educational status and animal health care practice were not significant. At the animal level, the results showed that age and animal origin were identified as significant predictors for BTB positivity but sex and body condition score were not related to BTB status. Descriptive analysis revealed that herds having \'BTB history\' showed slightly higher likelihood of being BTB positive compared to farms having no previous BTB exposure. In conclusion, this study showed relatively lower average prevalence in the emerging dairy regions as compared to the prevalence observed in and around Addis Ababa City, warranting for implementation of control program at this stage to reduce or possibly stop further transmission of BTB."", \'original\': None}', 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Getnet Abie', 'last_name': 'Mekonnen', 'initials': None, 'researcher_id': 'ur.016223367751.74', 'grid_ids': array(['grid.7123.7'], dtype=object), 'orcid': array([], dtype=object), 'corresponding': True, 'raw_affiliations': array(['National Animal Health Diagnostic and Investigation Center, P.O.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Poor quality police interviews, including those involving coercion or intimidation, lead to miscarriages of justice and reduced conviction rates.  Bull’s work underpinned the design, development, and now global spread of the ‘PEACE’ method of investigative interviewing.  It is the basis of the forthcoming United Nations \(UN\) Universal Protocol.  This method replaces ‘interrogation’ that can often be coercive and result in false confessions.  In 2018, Bull accepted an invitation to be directly involved in the drafting of the ‘Universal Protocol’ for the UN which will be published in 2021 \(delayed from late 2020 due to COVID\-19\).  The ultimate impact is to reduce coercion and torture, to improve the rate and integrity of convictions and to minimise miscarriages of justice. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Torture and miscarriages of justice remain an important global problem. The United Nations \(UN\) Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan E. Méndez, has argued in favour of stronger universal standards of investigative interviewing to combat this.  Bull and colleagues \(including Walsh \[at University of Derby between 2006 and 2018\], Dando \[Westminster\], Cleary \[Virginia Commonwealth\], Snook \[Memorial, Newfoundland\] and Albuquerque \[Braga\]\) investigated three inter\-related topics: \(1\) the actual effectiveness of the ‘PEACE’ \(Planning, Engage, Account, Closure, Evaluation\) method of investigative interviewing \(which is based on Bull’s work\), and its improvement; \(2\) the views of suspects/offenders about investigative interviewing/interrogating; and \(3\) how to interview suspects to best detect truth/lies.  The underpinning research is in over 100 outputs between 1991 and the present, which include 41 outputs since November 2012 when Bull joined the University of Derby \(UoD\). 

  

 **1. The effectiveness of the ‘PEACE’ method** 

 3.1 analysed over 50 police interviews with suspected murderers/rapists, finding that rapport/empathy and open\-type questions were associated with an increased likelihood of suspects admitting the offence; and that some techniques traditionally taught in the USA were counterproductive.  3.2 examined over 100 interviews with suspected fraudsters, finding that: \(i\) better ‘PEACE’ skills were associated with gaining more, and more relevant, information/confessions; and \(ii\) that some skills needed to be strengthened and training reformed. 3.3 found that Bull *et al.*’s new idea of ‘category clustering’ enhanced interviewees’ recall; this technique is now being taught to investigators. 

  

 **2. The views of suspects/offenders about investigative interviewing/interrogating** 

 3.4 found that among 400 jail inmates, most strongly agreed with the notions that ‘A police interviewer should give suspects a chance to tell their side of the story’, ‘interviewers should favour fact\-finding over obtaining confessions’ and ’treating suspects with respect’; and strongly disapproved of police using false evidence \(still permitted in the USA\). 3.5 found that 100 Canadian jail inmates indicated that they were more likely to cooperate and confess when evidence was strong and when interviews were conducted in a humanitarian fashion. These findings are contributing to the development of the UN’s extensive ‘Universal Protocol’ on non\-coercive interviewing, which Bull is directly involved in drafting \(see section 4\). 

  

 **3. How best to interview suspects to detect truth/lies** 

 3.2 and 3.6 focus on revealing evidence to suspects, comparing early with late and gradual disclosure \(found effective in earlier work by Bull dating to 2003\).  In 3.6 the interviews were conducted by experienced police officers and in 3.2 by investigators working for a government agency. The two studies suggested that gradual disclosure led to substantially better truth/lies detection and this has become part of training in the UK and elsewhere.  In 3.2, gradual disclosure was associated with more skilled interviewing using the ‘PEACE’ method.  This research substantiates one of the key principles of the ‘PEACE’ method; namely, that ‘what an interviewee says should be compared with what the interviewer knows in a strategic manner’.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of Bull’s work is on: \(1\) international standards; \(2\) professional training; \(3\) police practice internationally and, through this, on \(4\) reducing harm and improving the quality of justice. 

  

 **International standards** 

 Bull’s research has been influential in the UN’s decision to develop a ‘Universal Protocol’ on the PEACE Method.  The UN’s Special Rapporteur reviewed all available research and drew heavily on Bull’s work stating, *“the work of Professor Bull has already influenced international standards with regard to investigative interviewing”* \[5.1.1\].  Bull subsequently \(in 2018\) accepted an invitation to join a small ‘Steering Committee’ formed to draft the Universal Protocol \[5.2\], which is now close to completion. 

 **International training and professional development** 

 Wicklander\-Zulawski undertakes 450 training seminars globally each year with professional investigators.  Under the influence of Bull’s work \(including 3.1 to 3.6\), they changed their practice in March 2017.  Wicklander\-Zulawski’s founding partner says, *“Bull’s research… played a part in our recent decision to no longer teach the confrontational Reid Nine Steps Interrogation Method…helped change our interview style to include the Cognitive Interview…”* \[5.1.4\], which is based on the PEACE Method as developed and modified by Bull. 

  

 **Domestic police and investigative training and practice in 18 plus countries** 

 Bull’s work has been influential in shaping police training and practice in multiple countries.  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police \(RCMT\) attribute changes in practice \(affecting all 33,000 officers\) to Bull’s work, including the adoption of ‘tactical use of evidence’ and a Phased Interview Model from 2014.  A Detective of the RCMP said, *“Bull’s research … cannot be overstated… has been instrumental in supporting our argument for transformation … to a new more effective approach”* \[5.1.3\].  In the US, a major change, *“within the US government to stop the spread of brutal interrogation…directly relates to the global impact … Bull is having today”* \[5.1.8\], according to the former Director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and Assistant Director of Training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. In the UK, Bull’s research has led to changes in the way that police officers are trained.  As the National Police Advisor on Interviewing notes: *“it is not an overstatement to say that the training developed as a result of \[Bull’s\] research has affected the working practices of every one of the over 100,000 police officers in England and Wales”* \[5.1.5\]. Bull’s research has had similar impacts on the training of thousands of police officers in Norway \[5.1.2\], Sweden \( *“20,000 officers”\)* \[5.1.7\], Japan \[5.1.9\] and a range of other countries and organisations \(including the US, New Zealand and the UN\) where training is provided by Forensic Interview Solutions \[5.1.7\]. 

 Further pathways to impact are through Bull being invited to provide direct input to policy and practice through invited presentations of his research to policymakers and police practitioners \(since 2012\): in Brazil \(April 2014, to parts of the national government\); Canada \(February 2016, at the HQ of the Quebec Province Police\); China \(October 2018, at the Beijing Police Academy and at the Senior Officers University\); Jamaica \(June 2018, to police, organised by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office\); Malaysia \(April 2014, at the National Police Academy\); Mexico \(October 2018 and April 2016, to over 100 investigators\); Pakistan \(December 2014, to terrorism investigators\); Poland \(September 2015, at the National Academy for Border Guards\); Russia \(November 2017, to child abuse investigators\); South Africa \(February 2015, to the Police Behavioural Science Branch\); Taiwan \(April 2017, at the National Police University\); Thailand \(May 2016, to the Royal Thai Police\); USA \(April 2015, to over 100 ‘interrogators’\). 

 **Harm reduction and improving the quality of justice** 

 There are two ultimate beneficiaries of this research impact. The first are those who may have been subjected to coercive interrogation or torture without the PEACE method being applied. The second ultimate beneficiary is the general public interest in justice. This is because Bull’s research also shows that the PEACE method produces more reliable evidence and better quality convictions.  It is impossible to quantify the scale of these benefits credibly. However, the international reach of the adoption and shaping of practice noted here suggests that both are very widespread and substantial.  As an indication of this, the former UN Special Rapporteur notes that Bull’s research and the changes in practice it has brought about, *“will have a profound impact on hundreds of thousands \(if not millions\) of individuals across the globe…”* \[5.1.1\].

The information source was audio-tape-recorded interviews with 56 suspects. These recordings were obtained from 11 police services across England and Wales and were analysed using a specially designed coding frame. It was found that interviewers employed a range of strategies with presentation of evidence and challenge the most frequently observed. Closed questions were by far the most frequently used, and open questions, although less frequent, were found to occur more during the opening phases of the interviews. The frequency of ineffective question types (e.g. negative, repetitive, multiple) was low. A number of significant associations were observed between interviewer strategies and suspect responses.

A total of 151 participants played an interactive computer game as either a truth‐teller or a deceiver, and were interviewed afterwards. Game information known to the interviewer was revealed either early, at the end of the interview, or gradually throughout. Subsequently, 30 laypersons individually viewed a random selection of interviews (five deceivers and five truth‐tellers from each condition), and made veracity and confidence judgements.

The enhanced cognitive interview (ECI) has been widely used for this purpose and found to be generally effective. We focused on further increasing recall with a new interview strategy, category clustering recall (CCR).

Participants interviewed with CCR (RECI1 and RECI2) produced more information without compromising accuracy; thus, CCR was effective. Eye closure and additional open‐ended follow up questions did not further influence recall when using CCR.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Nottingham research has transformed knowledge of the timing, circumstances, and cultural impact of the human\-instigated, global distribution of fallow deer populations. It shows that many contemporary issues in fallow deer management and conservation directly reflect historical changes to geographical and biocultural circumstances. Impact has been achieved by using this understanding to: 

1.  Change deer management guidance and conservation policies of specialist interest groups, deer managers and conservation organisations in the UK, Barbuda and in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s \(IUCN\) Red List. 

1.  Create, and stimulate the creation of, interdisciplinary educational resources for the public in the UK and Barbuda. 

1.  Transform awareness of the significance of fallow deer for heritage and environment sector practitioners in the UK and Barbuda and, in turn, the communities they engage.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 At the University of Nottingham, **Sykes** \(UoN 2006 – 2018\) led a transdisciplinary team, including **Miller** \(UoN 2012 – present\), **Daujat** \(UoN 2014 – present\) and Karis Baker \(based at Durham University\), of archaeologists, geneticists, geochemists, art historians and anthropologists in research that transformed understanding of fallow deer. The AHRC\-funded ‘Dama International: Fallow deer \( *Dama dama dama*\) and European Society 6000 BC \- AD 1600’ project \(2012\-2015\) delivered the first transdisciplinary programme of research into the most widely distributed deer species on the planet. In 2014, the reach of this work was extended to include the Mesopotamian fallow deer subspecies \( *D.d mesopotamica*\) through research by **Daujat**. The results have radically changed understanding of the timing, circumstances, and bio\-cultural impact of fallow deer species across the world, from prehistory to the present. 

 This research shows that fallow deer are an excellent proxy for human diasporas, both physical and ideological. The timing and location of fallow deer introductions beyond their native range are the result of successive human actions. The research has shown that this was motivated by human attitudes towards the dominance of nature: that wild animals, a living representation of the wilderness, could be managed, bringing order to the natural world. These attitudes were discussed by Columella and Varro, writing at the time fallow deer were first being introduced to Western Europe. The team have demonstrated that similar worldviews drove subsequent translocations of the species in Medieval Europe and across the globe as part of colonial expansion to the ‘New World’. UoN\-led transdisciplinary investigations of the physical and cultural circumstances of fallow deer through time has provided interpretation that is impactful for a range of disciplines and audiences. Three key results of this research served to underpin the subsequent programme of impact: 

 \(1\) Understanding when historical fallow deer populations were translocated, and the associated cultural reasons for doing so. Received wisdom suggested that fallow deer were native to Anatolia \(modern\-day Turkey\), but the research identified previously unknown glacial refugia for the species **\(1\)**. Fallow deer became culturally important within these native distributions in ways that later influenced Greek and Roman culture **\(2\)**. From the 1<sup>st</sup> century AD, fallow deer were translocated through Europe and into Britain, where they were imparked at high status sites, such as Fishbourne Roman Palace, as symbols of identity and status. Fallow deer are a proxy for the movement of the accompanying people, but also for the movement of cultural ideas and attitudes to the natural world **\(2\)**. 

 \(2\) Identification of an extirpation of Roman fallow deer populations in Britain, with a later re\-introduction **,** spurring the fashion for Medieval deer parks **\(3\)**. Practices associated with hunting fallow deer became central to society as highly ritualised markers of status **\(4\)**. Medieval and post\-Medieval groups that delighted in fallow deer, took populations with them as they navigated a growing empire. This continued the spread of fallow deer, their cultural significance and associated worldviews **\(4\-5\)**. 

 \(3\) Contextualising the present\-day problem of overstocking of fallow deer in Britain as a legacy of the introduction of Medieval hunting stock. Associated legacy solutions, like hunting or \(in the modern vernacular\) culling, are unpopular with the public but management is necessary for deer and environmental health **\(5\)**. In other parts of the world, modern fallow deer populations have become culturally iconic but have problematic conservation status. In Barbuda, this legacy can be traced to 18<sup>th</sup>\-century colonial movement of fallow deer populations from Britain **\(6\)**.

1.  **Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)** 

 Globally, fallow deer populations are simultaneously considered to be domestic and translocated, feral and invasive, wild and endangered, locally extinct and subject to rewilding campaigns. This patchwork of understanding and research oversight of the biocultural significance of this species, meant there was little comprehension of how this species came to occupy a wide range of environmental and cultural niches. UoN\-led research has addressed this, with outcomes that have shaped conservation policies, changed deer management practices and built sustainable capacity for a wider understanding of the cultural significance of this species around the world. 

1.  **Shape deer management and conservation policies** 

 The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s \(IUCN\) Red List is globally recognised as the most authoritative guide on the status of biological diversity, compiling threats to species, their ecological distribution and requirements, and information on conservation actions that should be taken to reduce risk of extinction. It is consulted by governments, organisations, and individuals to understand and mitigate conservation issues. When updating the Red List entry for Persian fallow deer in 2015, the IUCN executive approached researchers on UoN\-led fallow deer projects \( **Daujat** and Baker\) to contribute to the international guidance on extant but endangered populations in Israel and Iran. 20% of the current \(2015\) Red List entry has changed from the preceding \(2013\) entry in areas such as Geographic Range, Threats and Population, directly reflecting input drawn from our research **\[A\]**. 

 In Barbuda, where fallow deer are a source of pride and national identity, the effects of Hurricane Irma significantly threatened translocated populations of the species. UoN research **\(6\)** was used by the director of NGO Barbuda Research Complex, to inform the deer preservation and conservation work on the island **\[B\]**. As the Director noted: “ *The research is the only existing scientific information on the Barbuda fallow deer and in this regard it presents an invaluable resource for the conservation effort, given that the deer is facing extinction… we are now working towards embedding these findings into policy recommendations for Barbuda’s government…* *the findings are providing valuable input to influence governmental priorities regarding the preservation of deer*” **\[B\]**. 

 In Britain, the team used findings from our research to change the decision\-making practices of organisations and individuals who manage deer. These engagements occurred through 25 talks to special interest groups, such as the British Deer Society, the Deer Initiative, the Ministry of Defence, the Small Woods Association and the National Trust and independent deer managers. Individual events regularly attracted up to 50 people. Leading Deer Welfare Specialist, who consults with all of these groups, and provides veterinary services to c.5000 deer on deer parks and farms in the UK, explained how the research affected this change in practice in three important ways **\[C\]**: 

 1\) Refined the culling strategies of deer managers and deer park keepers through the application of the new method for ageing fallow deer developed by the Dama International team **\(7\)**, ensuring that herd size is managed through informed decision making. 

 2\) Informed new clinical understandings of bovine tuberculosis in fallow deer for deer managers, park keepers and vets, through this more accurate ageing of infected individuals **\(7\)**, which “will help to protect and care for the herds better but also contribute to minimising the negative financial impact of TB in deer populations”. 

 3\) Enabled veterinary professionals to persuade deer managers and park keepers to recognise the importance of out\-breeding **\[C, Dii\]**, by challenging pre\-conceived notions that fallow deer across the UK are genetically identical **\(1\)**; in turn this minimises the health risks associated with closed herds including “reduced fertility and/or increased neonatal mortality…. reduced immunocompetence and … \[increased\] susceptibility to parasitism and disease”. 

 In 2018, **Miller** provided evidence to the City of London’s *Epping Forest and Buffer Lands Deer Management Review* **\[Di\].** The results have informed 20\-year policy and guidance for the management of c.700 fallow deer inhabiting the 7942\-acre site **\[Dii\],** visited by 4.2 million annually. Head Keeper and Constable, notes that the City of London Corporation *“turned to Dr **Miller** of the Dama International Project for up\-to\-date research in overhauling…policies. The tender specified that the research outcomes of the Dama International Project were to be considered in the review”* **\[Diii\]**. Our research highlighted the cultural significance **\(3, 4\)** of the forest deer, underpinning all resulting policy to maintain the presence of fallow deer at the site \(in contrast to Muntjac populations\) **\[Dii\]**. An important finding of the research was to confirm that the Birch Hall Sanctuary population is not genetically unique **\(1\)**, thereby changing the relative status of these deer and the policies by which they are managed by their keepers **\[Dii\]**. 

1.  **Create, and stimulate others in the creation of, interdisciplinary educational resources** 

 In 2014, UoN Dama International researchers were invited to partner with Fishbourne Roman Palace **\(2\)** and Dudley Castle Museum **\(3\)** to create major new exhibitions for the independent heritage venues. Both exhibitions had significant reach: the Curator of Fishbourne Roman Palace noted that 30,000 attended the exhibition between September 2014 and March 2015. Feedback from the Palace noted the interdisciplinary nature of the exhibition, including archaeological science and natural history, which enabled them to reach new audiences by departing from their usual stories of Roman architecture **\[E\]**. Directly inspired by her visit to the Fishbourne exhibition, author Caroline Lawrence set elements of her children’s book *The* *Romans Quest: Escape From Rome* \(2016\) at the site, with reference to fallow deer in the text and explanatory notes **\[F\]**. *“Your exhibition convincingly argued that fallow deer were introduced by the Romans to the UK for the first time right there at Fishbourne. This was something I was not aware of before… and actually inspired aspects of my novel.”* *Escape from Rome* has \[text redacted\] and c.27 schools are using it as a class reader for Key Stage 2 **\[Fii\]**. 

 Another independent volume that draws heavily on UoN fallow deer research is Dan Eatherley’s *Invasive Aliens* \(2019\), which has sold 3115 copies internationally and was a Sunday Times, Telegraph and Waterstones Book of the Year. The author notes **\[G\]: “** *In the Dama International Project research I found a species that was particularly emblematic, serving to highlight many of the crucial themes that characterise human relationships with transported species… The research thus helped me appreciate and convey to my readers the complexity of the history of human animal relationships and the circumstances and consequences of introducing new species, not just the fallow deer, but also other species discussed in my book.”* 

 Between 2013 and 2016, the National Trust invited UoN researchers to develop a series of ‘deer unmaking’ events, accompanied by a resource booklet created by the team, centred on the history of ritualised Medieval hunting. These events have been characterised as *“provocative, perception challenging and engaging”* by National Trust’s Consultancy Manager **\[H\]**. They raised wider public awareness of the cultural role of fallow deer at historic houses and changed public perception of the role of hunting: Hall notes that this is *“now part of the Trust’s narrative at sites with a historical connection to fallow deer,*” **\[H\]**, examples include Studley Royal \(Yorks\), Charlecote \(War\), Calke Abbey \(Derbs\), Lyme Park \(Ches\), Holnicote Estate \(Som\), Dyrham Park \(Glos\), Knole \(Kent\), Dunwick Heath \(Suff\), Hatfield Forest \(Essex\) and Powis Castle in Wales. 

 Rollout of educational resources at Epping Forest \(June 2020, **\[Diii\]**\) and Barbuda \(July 2020, **\[B\]**\) have been postponed due to COVID\-19 restrictions **\(COVID statement\).** 

1.  **Transform awareness of the significance of fallow deer for heritage and environment sector practitioners** 

 As a result of UoN\-led research, the team built capacity amongst heritage and environment sector workers to raise wider public awareness of the fallow deer they managed in provocative and engaging ways, changing the outlook of the practitioners to this species, and therefore the information and interpretation that is presented to the public across a number of sites important to environmental and cultural heritage across the UK **\[D, E, H\]**: 

 The impact at Fishbourne Roman Palace included changing the way that curators, staff, and volunteers view the site, engage the public, and approach research with other Higher Education Institutions. Head Curator noted: *“the story \[of the Fishbourne fallow deer\]* **\(2\)** *has been embraced by all of our staff here and is now as central to our visitor interpretation as the story of the building and our mosaics. It has also changed staff attitudes towards research at the Palace – the overwhelming feeling now being that research is interesting, relevant and worthwhile – this has led to a desire within the organisation to engage with other projects in the future”* **\[E\]**. 

 At the National Trust, our research has been embedded in the training of the staff delivering property tours. For example, at Belton House \(Lincs\) which receives c.400,000 visitors annually, 60 staff and 300 volunteers now include information on the patching of the knuckle bone floor with fallow deer remains from the herd at the site **\(4\)** into their engagements with the public, along with wider research findings **\(7\)**. Deer managers at the site have also used the research to inform their walks, which take place four times a year with c.20 members of the public, meaning that some 480 people have been exposed to a perception of fallow deer that has been changed by the research **\[H\]**. Across the National Trust properties with deer management teams, the team trained stalkers in Medieval ‘unmaking’ techniques **\(U3\)**, which they have gone on to use as part of their deer management and educational programme. The National Trust notes: *“Medieval\-style ‘Deer Unmakings’ at the properties has helped to promote a ‘plot to plate’ approach to the annual cull and venison sales. Since the work of the Dama International Project, the estate has embraced the product as firmly marketed ‘Belton Venison’ where previously there was more circumspection in terms of the origins of our menu offering,”* **\[H\]**. Similar planned work at Epping Forest with environment sector professionals by **Miller** in 2020 was postponed due to COVID\-19 restrictions **\(COVID statement\).** 

 As a result of these changes, the Dama International project was identified by the AHRC as an outstanding example of impact and showcased it in their 10th Anniversary publication **\[I\]** where it is highlighted that “ *An AHRC project has overturned earlier theories about the origins of a much\-loved species…* *the project team have been working with the British Deer Society, the National Trust and inner\-city schools to highlight the cultural significance of the fallow deer herds as well as the need to manage the populations — several National Trust properties are now selling fallow deer venison in their gift shops and cafes.”*

Without such techniques it is difficult to reconstruct hunting patterns, which is a significant problem for the examination of assemblages from pre‐farming cultures. This paper presents a new method, based on mandibular tooth eruption and wear, for assessing the age of fallow deer. The method was developed from a large collection ( n = 156) of known‐age Dama dama specimens, has been blind tested by members of the zooarchaeological community and represents a user‐friendly system with the potential to generate large compatible datasets through which the dynamics of human– Dama relationships can be examined.

It will review the dynamics of human–Dama relationships from the 1500s AD to the present day and consider how the meaning attached to this species has changed through time: from a symbol of colonial authority and dominance, to a ‘walking larder’ after the slave emancipation of 1834, and now an important part of the island’s economy and cultural heritage that requires careful management.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': '[{\'first_name\': \'Sophia\', \'last_name\': \'Perdikaris\', \'initials\': None, \'researcher_id\': \'ur.0675577730.54\', \'grid_ids\': array([\'grid.253482.a\', \'grid.183006.c\'], dtype=object), \'orcid\': array([\'0000-0001-6523-2249\'], dtype=object), \'corresponding\': False, \'raw_affiliations\': array([\'Human Ecodynamics Research Center, The Graduate Center CUNY, New York, NY, USA\',\n        \'Brooklyn College CUNY, Brooklyn, NY, USA\',\n        \'Barbuda Research Complex, Codrington Barbuda, Antigua and Barbuda\'],\n       dtype=object), \'affiliations_address\': array([{\'grid_id\': \'grid.253482.a\', \'city_id\': 5128581, \'state_code\': \'US-NY\', \'country_code\': \'US\', \'raw_affiliation\': \'Human Ecodynamics Research Center, The Graduate Center CUNY, New York, NY, USA\'},\n        {\'grid_id\': \'grid.183006.c\', \'city_id\': 5110302, \'state_code\': \'US-NY\', \'country_code\': \'US\', \'raw_affiliation\': \'Brooklyn College CUNY, Brooklyn, NY, USA\'},\n        {\'grid_id\': None, \'city_id\': 3576311, \'state_code\': None, \'country_code\': \'AG\', \'raw_affiliation\': \'Barbuda Research Complex, Codrington Barbuda, Antigua and Barbuda\'}],\n       dtype=object)}\n {\'first_name\': \'Allison\', \'last_name\': \'Bain\', \'initials\': None, \'researcher_id\': \'ur.011140455231.07\', \'grid_ids\': array([\'grid.23856.3a\'], dtype=object), \'orcid\': array([], dtype=object), \'corresponding\': False, \'raw_affiliations\': array([\'CELAT Research Centre, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada\'],\n       dtype=object), \'affiliations_address\': array([{\'grid_id\': \'grid.23856.3a\', \'city_id\': 6325494, \'state_code\': \'CA-QC\', \'country_code\': \'CA\', \'raw_affiliation\': \'CELAT Research Centre, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada\'}],\n       dtype=object)}\n {\'first_name\': \'Sandrine\', \'last_name\': \'Grouard\', \'initials\': None, \'researcher_id\': \'ur.011537630237.47\', \'grid_ids\': array([\'grid.410350.3\'], dtype=object), \'orcid\': array([\'0000-0002-2101-0879\'], dtype=object), \'corresponding\': False, \'raw_affiliations\': array([""UMR7209 Archéozoologie, Archéobotanique: Sociétés, Pratiques, Environnements, Muséum National d\'Histoire Naturelle, Dept Homme & Environnement, Paris, France""],\n       dtype=object), \'affiliations_address\': array([{\'grid_id\': \'grid.410350.3\', \'city_id\': 2988507, \'state_code\': None, \'country_code\': \'FR\', \'raw_affiliation\': ""UMR7209 Archéozoologie, Archéobotanique: Sociétés, Pratiques, Environnements, Muséum National d\'Histoire Naturelle, Dept Homme & Environnement, Paris, France""}],\n       dtype=object)}\n {\'first_name\': \'Karis\', \'last_name\': \'Baker\', \'initials\': None, \'researcher_id\': \'ur.01217775152.21\', \'grid_ids\': array([\'grid.8250.f\'], dtype=object), \'orcid\': array([], dtype=object), \'corresponding\': False, \'raw_affiliations\': array([\'School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, University of Durham, Durham, UK\'],\n       dtype=object), \'affiliations_address\': array([{\'grid_id\': \'grid.8250.f\', \'city_id\': 2650628, \'state_code\': None, \'country_code\': \'GB\', \'raw_affiliation\': \'School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, University of Durham, Durham, UK\'}],\n       dtype=object)}\n {\'first_name\': \'Edith\', \'last_name\': \'Gonzalez\', \'initials\': None, \'researcher_id\': \'ur.013365424013.22\', \'grid_ids\': array([\'grid.253482.a\', \'grid.183006.c\'], dtype=object), \'orcid\': array([], dtype=object), \'corresponding\': False, \'raw_affiliations\': array([\'Human Ecodynamics Research Center, The Graduate Center CUNY, New York, NY, USA\',\n        \'Brooklyn College CUNY, Brooklyn, NY, USA\',\n        \'Barbuda Research Complex, Codrington Barbuda, Antigua and Barbuda\'],\n       dtype=object), \'affiliations_address\': array([{\'grid_id\': \'grid.253482.a\', \'city_id\': 5128581, \'state_code\': \'US-NY\', \'country_code\': \'US\', \'raw_affiliation\': \'Human Ecodynamics Research Center, The Graduate Center CUNY, New York, NY, USA\'},\n        {\'grid_id\': \'grid.183006.c\', \'city_id\': 5110302, \'state_code\': \'US-NY\', \'country_code\': \'US\', \'raw_affiliation\': \'Brooklyn College CUNY, Brooklyn, NY, USA\'},\n        {\'grid_id\': None, \'city_id\': 3576311, \'state_code\': None, \'country_code\': \'AG\', \'raw_affiliation\': \'Barbuda Research Complex, Codrington Barbuda, Antigua and Barbuda\'}],\n       dtype=object)}\n {\'first_name\': \'A.

manipulated by humans may show patterns of population structure that reflect those interactions. At the same time, natural processes shape populations, including behavioural characteristics like dispersal potential and breeding system. In Europe, a key factor is the geography and history of climate change through the Pleistocene. During glacial maxima throughout that period, species in Europe with temperate distributions were forced south, becoming distributed among the isolated peninsulas represented by Anatolia, Italy and Iberia. Understanding modern patterns of diversity depends on understanding these historical population dynamics. Traditionally, European fallow deer (Dama dama dama) are thought to have been restricted to refugia in Anatolia and possibly Sicily and the Balkans. However, the distribution of this species was also greatly influenced by human-mediated translocations. We focus on fallow deer to better understand the relative influence of these natural and anthropogenic processes. We compared modern fallow deer putative populations across a broad geographic range using microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA loci. The results revealed highly insular populations, depauperate of genetic variation and significantly differentiated from each other. This is consistent with the expectations of drift acting on populations founded by small numbers of individuals, and reflects known founder populations in the north. However, there was also evidence for differentiation among (but not within) physically isolated regions in the south, including Iberia. In those regions we find evidence for a stronger influence from natural processes than may be expected for a species with such strong, known anthropogenic influence.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors':

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Brunel research has supported the growth of a green technology business that produces decking from wood polymer composite incorporating waste products. Having started as a small importation business, by 2017 Brunel research had helped Ecodek develop into a company worth GBP8,500,000 manufacturing durable, recyclable decking in the UK and selling its products across the UK and worldwide. 

 It now employs over 50 staff, manufacturing 1,000,000 linear metres of decking per annum, consuming 3,600t of sustainably sourced wood and recycled plastic \(including the equivalent of over 100,000,000 4\-pint milk bottles\) whilst locking up 600,000 kgCO<sub>2</sub> each year. The decking has now been used in over 6,000 projects, including a number of high\-profile prestige projects, such as the Jumeirah Residence Beach Walkway in Dubai, the London Olympic Stadium and Prime Place Greenwich.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Mizi Fan’s long\-standing collaboration with Vannplastic and Ecodek has enabled the company to develop the technology to produce decking from wood polymer composite \(WPC\) and hence become the UK’s leading decking manufacturer and supplier. 

 A key focus of the research has been the use of waste products to create the composite as well as ensuring that the decking is recyclable \[Ref 1\]. To enhance the sustainability of WPCs and alleviate the resource competition with other industrial sectors, Prof Fan developed a research programme which explored the use of waste tyre rubber as a potential source material to create Rubber\-Wood\-Plastic Composites \(RubWPC\). In 2013 Brunel led an EU FP7 R&D project, RubWPC, collaborating with Ecodek and other partners \[Ref 2\]. 

 In this research the Brunel team developed new mixture designs, determined the structure and bonding mechanism, and established the complex structure\-property relationship of RubWPC. These were then transferred to the Ecodek research facility for further testing on the test production line before being scaled up for commercial production. 

 Further research continued into other potential materials. In 2016 Brunel and Ecodek collaborated in the EU funded SMART\-Plant and GelClad research projects which sought to create new generations of WPC using both biopolymer and bio/renewable fibres with minimal environmental impacts. These projects aimed at replacing the extensively used oil\-based thermoplastics in WPC by using bioplastics, such as Polyhydroxyalkanoates \(PHA\) and Poly\(lactic acid\) \(PLA\). A highly novel cost\-effective, durable industrialised and easy to install composite insulation cladding system was developed and implemented \(GELCLAD cladding,   [https://www.gelclad.eu/](https://www.gelclad.eu/) \) \[Ref 3\]. 

 The Brunel research group has also sought to address the major challenges of fire and other properties of cellulosic\-bioplastics materials \[Ref 4\], intrinsic incompatibility and insufficient interfacial bonding between the raw material constituents \[Ref 2,5\], and processing difficulties of bioplastics on existing compounding/extrusion line \[Ref 3,6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Ecodek is now the leading company for extruded wood polymer composite \(WPC\) decking in the UK and the only one which manufactures its products in the UK. A carbon negative organisation, Ecodek was founded in 2002 and was purchased by the Epwin Group for GBP8,500,000 in 2015 \[S1\].  By 2017 they were manufacturing around 1,000,000 linear metres of decking per year consuming 3,600t of sustainably sourced wood and recycled plastic \[S2, S3\].  The Founder and Former Managing Director of Ecodek stated \[S1\], that Professor Fan’s research 

 *“was fundamental to the company’s technical development and growth and underpinned development of the Ecodek product range”.* 

 The composite material which is used for all of Ecodek’s products, would not have been achievable without the initial research and subsequent development work of Prof Fan and his team \[S1, S3\]. This longstanding relationship between Professor Fan and the company has been key to the success of the products that it has developed. 

 Each year the Ecodek manufacturing process locks up 600,000kgCO<sub>2</sub>, the equivalent of 300,000 trees per year. 

 **Developing products with a sustainable lifecycle** 

 Ecodek manufactures its products from recycled waste materials \(98%\) – primarily plastic \(HDPE\) with sustainably sourced or waste wood\- and its products are 100% recyclable and will be bought back by the company for reuse. The company only sends 2% of its waste to landfill and aiming to reduce this to 0%. 

 The company prides itself on creating a product that is sustainable. In 2016 the company used the equivalent of 100,000,000 recycled \(4 pint\) milk bottles in its decking, ensuring that the plastic did not get sent to landfill, and will be recycled again at the end of its life as decking \[S3\]. The Ecodek product range has been assessed by Bangor University to be carbon negative due to the net effect of removing carbon from the atmosphere. 

 Professor Fan’s expertise in materials and composites enabled the company to develop its own algorithms for agile additive solutions allowing them to adapt to variable qualities of HDPE feedstock. Ecodek was able to accept a wider range of waste materials from recycling companies, which allowed them to move away from using virgin HDPE in its formulas. 

 In addition, Ecodek is able to offer a waste buyback scheme: returned waste, off\-cut, old\-stock or unused Ecodek decking are bought back, recycled and used again. 

 **Building in\-house research and development capabilities** 

 The EU funded RubWPC project was the catalyst for Ecodek to develop their own in\-house capabilities. Prior to this, technical development was the responsibility of one of the founding partners. The project *“enabled the company to invest in technical staff as well as create a dedicated in\-house laboratory as well as a small test production line. The lab was equipped with DSE, FTIR and a UTM in order to test tensile strength, all of which enabled us to develop our product range and factory quality control.”* \[S1\] 

 The company was able to recruit a technical manager and a lab technician in 2014 and 2015 to conduct the research with Brunel and they remained following the project. The ongoing relationship between Professor Fan and his team and the Ecodek team has meant that the staff based at Ecodek have been able to increase the capabilities of their in\-house research and development laboratory. In particular, the company now has facilities and capabilities to test their product durability to more formal, industrial standards. The Technical Manager said \(in a private communication\) that “working with Prof Fan had forced changes, in a good way”, leading to an expansion of the skill sets employed at Ecodek and growing the technical department. 

 Ongoing research and development on the consistency of the polymer has been a necessary part of the Ecodek story as the availability and composition of the feedstock varies. In 2016, Ecodek used over 100,000,000 recycled 4\-pint milk bottles in their product \[S3\].  As a result of Prof Fan’s research, the company has developed an ability to respond to changing source materials, such as variations in the thickness of the bottles, which can vary between 0.3\-0.66mm.  Additional research on the consistency of the product material has expanded to testing of other recyclable materials, including gypsum, glass, hemp, agricultural waste, film waste and HDPE waste. 

 **Growing the Company** 

 From its formation in 2002, Ecodek has grown from a small operation that imported its product to a local manufacturer of environmentally\-friendly decking that was sold across the UK and the world. 

 In 2014 Vannplastic Ltd \(trading as Ecodek\) made an operating profit of GBP600,000. Ecodek was acquired by Epwin Group plc in November 2015 for GBP8,500,000. Epwin Group’s operational profit for the year to 31 December 2016 was GBP24,000,000 up from GBP19,100,000 in 2015. The increased material input costs as a result of continuing weakness of sterling against both the US Dollar and the Euro resulted in an operating profit of GBP22,300,000 in 2017 \[S3, S4\]. 

 Based in Wrexham, North Wales, Ecodek has grown from a small company in 2002 with only one production line to a company with 4 full production lines staffed by 50 staff 24 hours a day. The research and development team has grown from just the founding partner to a team of 6 staff with relevant technical knowledge and skill. Both the Founder and the Technical Manager of Ecodek attribute this growth to the work with Prof Fan \[S1,S3\]. 

 New products and innovative solutions have been developed as a result of Fan’s research findings which address the difficulties of mixing recyclable materials and maintaining consistency, thereby sustaining the business in the market. In addition to decking, Ecodek’s product range has expanded to facades, sub\-structure support beams for decks, and motorway sound barriers. All of these products use the composite materials developed in collaboration with Prof. Fan \[S3,S4\]. 

 **Ecodek products in use** 

 The weather resilience of Ecodek products means that they have an international appeal and are in use by clients across the globe, whether direct to consumers or through builders’ merchants such as Travis Perkins, including: 

 Dubai, UAE – Ecodek designed and developed a specific substructure for the Jumeirah Beach Walkway which would withstand the rigors of the climate. The walkway runs 14km along the UAE’s Persian Gulf coastline. At 1.7km “JBR The Walk” was designed as part of the Jumeirah Beach Residence, a hotel and shopping area with 15,000 residents in one of the most developed areas of Dubai. The final delivery of substructure was made in 2017. The Walk is one of Dubai’s most famous tourist attractions. Brunel’s research on wood polymer composite was used in this construction \[S1, S3\]. 

 London, UK – Ecodek decking was installed around the outside of the London 2012 Olympic stadium. As part of the legacy of the London Olympic Games, the park, stadium and other facilities have been converted and have been in continuous use since 2012. With over 5,700,000 visitors \[S5\] to the stadium since 2013 and its rebranding as the permanent home of British Athletics and West Ham United, the unique design benefits of Ecodek decking, including sustainability and durability, continue to be effectively demonstrated in this high traffic area. West Ham reported total attendance of 1,238,318 for the 22 games of the 2018/19 season \[S6\]. Following the end of the 2018/19 football season, the stadium hosted over 242,000 visitors at concerts, athletics meetings and baseball matches \[S3, S7\]. Again, this product had been developed with research from Brunel \[S1, S3\]. 

 Other prestige projects that have used decking manufactured by Ecodek include the Old Bailey London, Royal Wharf Docklands, Mann Island Liverpool and RSPB Weymouth \[S8\]. In total, Ecodek products have been used on over 6,000 projects. 

 **Sustainability in UK Housing Developments** 

 A key market for Ecodek products has been high rise housing developments with balconies across the UK as the decking can be manufactured to the exact size of the outdoor spaces. This reduces wastage in terms of having to re\-cut standard lengths and also saves time in the installation of the product. By 2015, approximately 65% of Ecodek’s sales were to housing developers, such as Barratt Homes and Taylor Wimpey. An example of such a development is Prime Place Greenwich which utilised 6 tonnes of decking \[S9\]. The bespoke nature of the manufacturing meant that at 360 Barking, another London development, Ecodek was able to supply lengths of decking at very specific lengths e.g. 7m, 5.73m, 4.9m, 3.75m and 1.9m, leading to minimal waste for the developer \[S10\]. Owners of the properties in these developments value the weather\-proofing and durability of the decking, which come with a 25\-year guarantee.

(SPC) in line with the circular economy concept by using recovered sludge cellulose from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Bearing the aim of replacing the wood in wood plastic composite (WPC) with sludge cellulose, WPC was developed in parallel for determining the substitution potentials. In order to maximise the integration of properties, maleic anhydride (MA) and vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) coupling agents were employed to refine the interfacial bonding of both SPC and WPC. In line with the main aim of circular economy - to decouple the economic value from the environmental impact, eco-efficiency analysis was performed for the developed process. The results showed that the tensile and flexural strength of the composites were substantially enhanced after both treatments, while MA appeared to be more efficient than VTMS in the refinery of interfacial bonding. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis confirmed the improvement of interface by identifying well embedded and firmly bonded wood flour or sludge cellulose in the matrix. WPC was marginally more thermally stable than SPC, while SPC suggested comparable flexural properties. Eco-efficiency assessment results showed that the SPC had better environmental and economic performance than the WPC. The latter turns sludge cellulose as a promising sustainable alternative to wood or natural fibres in the production of WPC.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Yonghui', 'last_name':

Fluorescence Microscope (FM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analyses showed the improvements of wood particle dispersion and wettability, compatibility of the constituents, and resin penetration, and impregnation of the composites after the coupling agent treatments.

Compared to untreated and single coupling agent treated composites, the composite treated with the combination of maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (MAPE) and bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide (Si69) coupling agents possessed superior tensile properties (i.e. tensile strength increased by 57.1% and tensile modulus increased by 20.7%) owing to the enhanced interfacial bonding and more efficient stress transfer. In addition, the nanomechanical property of MAPE&Si69 treated composite (i.e. elastic modulus increased from 15.93 GPa to 19.25 GPa) was also increased due to the penetration of matrix resin into wood

It has been verified in this research that hemp fibres contribute to a thermally resistant char layer in polyester composites. There is an increase in thermal resistance of the char layer at high temperatures with an increase in fibre volume fraction. Ignition is delayed with an increase in fibre volume above 25%. Mechanical degradation occurs at relatively low temperatures which may be associated with the decomposition of hemicellulose and lignin. The desirability of NFRPs in terms of fire performance increases with an increase in fibre volume fraction and material thickness.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 “Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation” \(DNACPR\) notices were introduced with the intention of protecting people from an invasive intervention that they would not benefit from or would prefer not to have. University of Cambridge collaborative research has identified many problems with their use in practice, and has helped develop and evaluate a new patient\-centred approach – the “ReSPECT” process – to empower patients to make personalised decisions about their goals of care and preferences for resuscitation. Supported by the Resuscitation Council UK, and endorsed by the Royal College of Physicians, Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and other major bodies, ReSPECT has replaced the system of DNACPR notices across much of the NHS. It ensures that emergency decisions reflect patients’ priorities, it improves conversations around anticipatory care planning, it supports clinicians in emergency situations, and it reduces harms. ReSPECT is valued by patients and staff for its patient\-centred focus and clarity about goals of care. Its positive impacts for the NHS include reduced readmissions to hospital, with associated cost\-savings.

 Supporting choices about resuscitation in the event of cardiac arrest 

 When someone’s heart and breathing stop, cardiopulmonary resuscitation \(CPR\) can be used to try to revive them. CPR is invasive, involving repeated heavy pressure on the chest, possible use of electric shocks, and other measures. It may not work. Even when someone is resuscitated, and especially if they are already frail, they might live for just a short time longer, and then in a state of great suffering \(e.g. broken ribs\) as a result of the intervention. As not everyone wants to receive attempted CPR, it is important to understand and respect people’s wishes and ensure they are offered a chance in advance to make the choices that are right for them. “Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation” \(DNACPR\) notices were introduced with this in mind, with the aim of guiding those present on the best action to take \(or not take\) should an individual suffer cardiac arrest. However, University of Cambridge research showed that DNACPR notices are often variably implemented in practice, that they may have unintended negative consequences, with patients with DNACPR notices receiving suboptimal treatments, and that a new approach was needed. 

 A new patient\-centred approach to decisions 

 A long\-term programme of University of Cambridge research, much of it conducted in collaboration with the University of Warwick, other universities, and major stakeholders including patients themselves and leading charities such as Marie Curie and the Resuscitation Council UK, has studied DNACPR practices. It identified misunderstandings, variations, and sub\-optimal practices in relation to DNACPR notices and, in response, has developed and evaluated a radically new approach to address this difficult issue. 

 A Cambridge\-led study of a large cohort in a UK hospital was important in establishing that DNACPR notices should not be equated with end\-of\-life: almost half of patients \(49%\) with a notice in place survived to discharge, and 17% were alive a year later \[1\]. Subsequent Cambridge research found, however, that rather than seeing it as a specific instruction that applied *only* in the event of a patient’s heart stopping, staff were inclined to misinterpret DNACPR notices as meaning that treatments other than CPR should also be withheld – they were confusing DNACPR status with end\-of\-life \[2\]. Further research confirmed this finding and identified the potentially stigmatising effects of how DNACPR notices were documented \[3\]. It also found that conversations between clinicians and patients and their families about DNACPR were apt to be avoided or done poorly \[3\]. 

 Prompted by this work, further Cambridge research led to the development of a new patient\-centred intervention known as the *Universal Form of Treatment Options*. It was based on the principle that the patient’s preferences for resuscitation should be discussed and documented in the context of their overall goals of care – not as an isolated decision. In an evaluative study, patients experienced fewer harms, and less severe harms, when the recommendation not to attempt CPR was recorded as part of the person’s overall goals using the *Universal Form of Treatment Options*, rather than on a standalone DNACPR notice \[4\]. The study showed that the approach not only enhanced clarity about goals of care: it also changed the character of handover conversations between staff on hospital wards to focus in a more holistic way on the patient’s condition and overall goals rather than their DNACPR status, suggesting that DNACPR notices were no longer being conflated with end\-of\-life decisions. 

 ReSPECT: the Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment 

 The patient\-centred principles established by the research on the *Universal Form of Treatment Options* critically informed “ReSPECT”, a subsequent large\-scale effort to improve treatment and care planning. It was developed to facilitate and record shared understanding of emergency care and planning with patients in a highly personalised way. With leadership from Cambridge, Warwick and others in a collaborative working group, development of ReSPECT was distinguished both by the extent of its stakeholder involvement, including patient advocates and a public consultation that drew over 1000 responses, and by its evidence\-based approach \[5\]. 

 Aimed at empowering patients and carers, the ReSPECT process involves focused conversations between clinicians, patients, and families, with outcomes recorded on a specially\-designed form \[5\]. It supports high quality, patient\-centred discussions about goals of care, with resuscitation recommendations for an emergency identified only after clinicians establish patients’ priorities. The ReSPECT process identifies the patient’s preference for the overall focus of care \(e.g. life\-sustaining treatment *or* symptom control\), tailors clinical guidance to the individual \(e.g. regarding appropriateness of hospital admission\), and highlights interventions that would not help, or that the patient would not want – including, but not only, CPR. The ReSPECT process draws extensively on the *Universal Form of Treatment Options* work \[4\], as the only format for which good evidence exists in documenting treatment goals in this context.

 Advance decisions about resuscitation: a global health and ethical issue 

 Globally, around 60 million people die every year, including about 600,000 in the UK \(World Health Organization statistics\). In high\-income countries like the UK, around half of deaths take place in hospital settings \(Public Health England statistics\). By the mid\-2000s, about 80% of the people who died in UK hospitals had a DNACPR notice in place, directly affecting about 240,000 individuals every year \( *Resuscitation* 2005\). Yet, as Cambridge research helped to show, DNACPR notices were prone to multiple unintended consequences and were often sub\-optimally implemented. This led to the recognition that a more personalised approach to making decisions was needed – one that could reflect the priorities, values and preferences of individual patients and the people important to them. University of Cambridge research has been important both in identifying problems in approaches to DNACPR notices and in developing and evaluating a practical solution – ReSPECT – now adopted at large scale in the NHS. 

 Empowering personalised decisions about goals of care, including resuscitation 

 The ReSPECT process, which links discussions about resuscitation with decisions about other aspects of emergency care and treatment, creates personalised recommendations for a person’s clinical care and treatment in the event of a future emergency where they would be unable to make or express choices because their heart has stopped. It provides greater clarity about patients’ priorities, it facilitates communication, and it reduces harms compared with standalone processes – such as DNACPR – that focus only on withholding resuscitation. 

 Impact on policy 

 Cambridge researchers and collaborators have worked in a highly engaged way with multiple stakeholders, including patients and families, policy\-makers, clinicians, charities, and system leaders to improve processes relating to treatment decisions and to secure their implementation. For example, in January 2015 they provided written evidence on their research to the UK Parliament’s Health Select Committee inquiry into end\-of\-life care and gave briefings to its key members, helping to stimulate understanding of the problems of DNACPR notices and the need for a process engaging broadly with patients’ goals. The Committee recommended *“that the Government review the use of DNACPR orders in acute care settings, including whether resuscitation decisions should be considered in the context of overall treatment plans. This Committee believes there is a case for standardising the recording mechanisms for the NHS in England”* \[A\]. 

 The Department of Health responded positively to this recommendation for improved processes focused on patient goals **.** Later in 2015, it recorded that a *“Working Group, co\-chaired by the President of the Resuscitation Council \(UK\) and the Head of Nursing Practice at the Royal College of Nursing has been established to look into this issue. The aim is to develop a national form that records decisions about CPR and other life\-sustaining treatment in the context of a broader plan”* \[B\] *.* The working group continues to meet regularly, chaired by Dr Fritz since 2018. Dr Fritz has also presented the findings and implications of the research programme \[4\] to other key stakeholder groups with influence on practice – for example to the Royal College of Physicians, General Medical Council and British Medical Association ethics groups. 

 The ReSPECT process, designed with leadership from Cambridge, Warwick and others, supports conversations about goals of care and generates a summary of patients’ wishes recorded on a specially designed form focused on patients’ personal priorities for care and agreed clinical recommendations about care and treatment \[5,C\]. The form is intended to be used in an emergency situation where a patient is unable to make decisions. Importantly, having a ReSPECT form does not automatically mean the patient is not for resuscitation – just that their goals have been discussed and documented, forming the basis for individualised care decisions. 

 ReSPECT is now referenced in influential guidelines and reports. For example, the Royal College of Physicians’ *Talking about dying* makes the recommendation: “ *Consider using a structured tool, such as the ReSPECT process, to support conversations and documentation”* \[D\]. The Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine’s *Care at the end of life* cites ReSPECT as a valuable resource \[D\]. The Resuscitation Council UK has recognised the importance of ReSPECT as a way of ensuring that individuals received appropriate CPR, and has funded a full\-time clinical lead to support its adoption in England and Scotland. It writes that ReSPECT can *“change the culture of both patients and clinicians in a way that will lead to better communication between them and ultimately better person\-centred care”* \[E\]. 

 Changes to organisational policies 

 Launched in 2017, the ReSPECT process \[C,F\] has already replaced DNACPR notices in many NHS organisations, including hospitals, clinical commissioning groups and ambulance trusts. For example, of 227 hospital, mental health and ambulance trusts in England, 87 are now using ReSPECT and 38 are actively working towards adoption \[E\]. These changes have happened even though there is no national mandate or financial incentive for the process, reflecting widespread recognition of ReSPECT’s value in delivering better, more patient\-centred care. 

 Impact for patients and the public 

 People living in areas that have adopted ReSPECT now have the opportunity to document their preferences about goals of treatment – and the clinical recommendations which align to them – on a nationally recognised form that will be respected in an emergency. This means that people are less likely to receive treatments they do not want, and that they would have refused if they had capacity. The ReSPECT process can be used with anyone, but has special relevance for some people who may be especially empowered by being allowed to make their priorities and preferences known – for example those with complex health needs, nearing the end of their lives, or at risk of sudden deterioration \[F\], all groups that are rapidly growing. 

 Evidence from adopters of ReSPECT indicates positive impacts for patients, families and clinicians nationwide. For example, a pilot of the ReSPECT process in NHS Forth Valley \[G\], conducted in 2017–19 and covering 200 patients, found that it led to multiple improvements. Patients and carers felt more involved in decision\-making and rated the process positively \(80% rating their experience as excellent and 20% as good\), and staff were better able to access the information to inform decision\-making in an emergency \[G\]. Usha Grieve, Director of Partnerships and Information at Compassion in Dying, states: 

 *“Evidence from our service users indicates strongly the need for a changed approach around end\-of\-life decision making both in terms of how wishes for care and treatment are discussed and how such wishes are recorded and communicated in emergencies. ReSPECT \[…\] places CPR decisions within the broader framework of a person’s priorities and needs. The impact of both these things is that people’s wishes are more frequently discussed, more easily known about and therefore more likely to be respected in an emergency scenario, and when these things happen it ultimately results in people having a better experience at the end of life.”* \[H\] 

 Impact for professionals 

 ReSPECT minimises confusion and ambiguity for professionals, including first responders during emergencies. Most \(88%\) staff in the Forth Valley evaluation felt that the ReSPECT process would enable them to deliver the most appropriate care for an individual \[G\]. Dr Dhushy Kumar, recent chair of the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee \(JRCALC\), states that *“the research in Cambridge has directly contributed to an overall change in approach to and discussion and documentation of resuscitation decisions: this has made it easier for ambulance clinicians to deliver excellent and appropriate care for patients”* \[I\]. 

 JP Nolan, head of nursing at the Royal College of Nurses from 2012\-2016, states that *“utilising and disseminating the research outputs on UFTO \[Universal Form of Treatment Options\], significant advances in policy and practice have been achieved \[… including\] practice based guidance on decisions related to CPR conducted at RCN and RCN Congress \[and\] improvements to the regulation of Nurses and Nursing related to end of life care”* \[J\]. 

 Impact for the NHS 

 The ReSPECT process has been adopted and welcomed across primary, pre\-hospital and secondary care, and has enhanced communication between these settings \[E,K\]. Evidence from the Forth Valley evaluation suggests that adopting ReSPECT can also improve service\-level outcomes: 27% of patients with a ReSPECT form were readmitted to hospital within three months of discharge, versus 43% of those without \(a statistically significant difference\), possibly because patients with ReSPECT forms have their preferred place of care recorded \[G\]. On average, the number of readmissions within three months of discharge per patient was 0.34 for patients with ReSPECT forms and 0.49 for those without. Assuming a national average non\-elective inpatient stay cost of GBP3,076 \(PSSRU Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2019\), this difference represents a cost saving of GBP461 per patient. During the Forth Valley pilot \(September 2017 to May 2018\), 200 patients received a ReSPECT form, an annual equivalent of 267 patients. Therefore, the total annual cost\-saving associated with use of ReSPECT was GBP123,087 in this one location. Scaled across the many sites now using ReSPECT nationally, the savings amount to millions of pounds annually. 

 ReSPECT and COVID\-19 

 The COVID\-19 pandemic has heightened the relevance and urgency of advanced care planning and thinking about patients’ priorities with sensitivity and compassion, as the potential for rapid deterioration makes anticipatory decision\-making vital. ReSPECT is extensively referenced in the supporting documentation for NICE’s COVID\-19 rapid guideline for critical care \(NG159\) as a means of supporting decisions about care and treatment, and initiating conversations with patients and families in difficult situations \[L\]. The Resuscitation Council UK has produced a webpage to help patients and their families make best use of ReSPECT during the pandemic \[L\].

been shown to be independently associated with patients receiving fewer treatments, reduced admission to intensive care and worse outcomes even after accounting for known confounders. The mechanisms by which they influence practice have not previously been studied.\\nOBJECTIVES: To present a rich qualitative description of the use of the DNACPR form in a hospital ward setting and explore what influence it has on the everyday care of patients.\\nDESIGN: Multi-source qualitative study, primarily using direct observation and semi-structured interviews based on two acute wards in a typical middle-sized National Health Service hospital in UK.\\nRESULTS: The study identified a range of ways in which DNACPR orders influence ward practice, beyond dictating whether or not cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be attempted. Five key themes encapsulate the range of potential impacts emerging from the data: the specific design and primacy of the form, matters relating to clinical decision making, staff reflections on how the form can affect care, staff concern over \'inappropriate\' resuscitation, and discussions with patients/relatives about DNACPR decisions. Overall, it was found that while the DNACPR form is recognized as serving a useful purpose, its influence negatively permeated many aspects of clinical practice.\\nCONCLUSION: DNACPR orders can act as unofficial \'stop\' signs and can often signify the inappropriate end to clinical decision making and proactive care. Many clinicians were uncomfortable discussing DNACPR orders with patients and families. These findings help understand why patients with DNACPR orders have worse outcomes, as such they may inform improvements in resuscitation policies."", \'original\': None}', 'Authors':

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Brunel research enabled the European Union to define criteria for identifying and regulating endocrine disrupting chemicals \(EDCs\) impacting on the health of its 445,000,000 citizens. EDCs can cause serious irreversible harm, such as birth defects and certain cancers. Brunel scientists established the foundations for protecting EU citizens against these harmful effects that then allowed the EU to define regulatory criteria for EDCs in the Delegated Regulations for biocides in 2017 and pesticides in 2018. This paves the way for the safe use of pesticides, biocides and other chemicals across the EU. It also gives manufacturers the regulatory certainty needed to develop and invest in the manufacture of safer products in compliance with EU law.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Protection from exposures to EDC is of great importance to people’s health. EDCs \(certain pesticides and biocides, plastic plasticisers, dioxins\) interfere with hormone systems during specific windows of susceptibility \(e.g. during fetal life or in childhood\) when they produce irreversible harm \(e.g. congenital malformations, decline in semen quality\). Exposures outside these windows are considerably less harmful \(Ref 1\). 

 When the European Commission proposed draft criteria for the identification of EDCs in 2013, a controversy about the toxicological principles that should guide their identification flared up among scientists. The dispute had confused EU decision makers and had blocked progress with developing regulatory criteria for EDCs. Defining such criteria by December 2013 was a legal obligation for the European Commission, set out in the EU Plant Protection Product Regulation \(Reg EU No 1107/2009\) and the Biocidal Product Regulation \(Reg EU No 528/2012\). Without developing these criteria, the provisions for protection against harmful effects from EDCs could not be realized. The research of Kortenkamp, Jobling and Martin untangled some complications and helped find common ground in the scientific underpinnings for regulating EDCs. In particular they developed a rigorous method for drawing conclusions about the strength of evidence linking EDC exposure to adverse health effects. With funding from the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research \(MISTRA\) they were instrumental in setting up a novel, 7\-step\-framework for the systematic review and assessment of EDC toxicological studies \(Ref 2\). 

 Regulatory practice relies on establishing doses below which no health concerns arise. However, this is difficult when, paradoxically, toxicity increases at low exposures and then diminishes as exposures escalate, as occurs with some EDCs. Such phenomena were contested by many traditional toxicologists and this controversy complicated the regulation of EDCs. On the invitation of the US National Academy of Sciences, Kortenkamp contributed to a review of the scientific evidence on this topic. The review concluded that non\-monotonic dose\-response relationships with some EDCs are a reality \(Ref 3\). 

 Even so, differences persisted among scientists about the principles that should underpin the identification of EDCs. Kortenkamp and Jobling reviewed the approaches that govern the identification of other classes of harmful substances, such as carcinogens and mutagens, and conducted an exegesis of EU law for EDCs. In framing the first step of EDC regulation as an issue of hazard identification, they established the basis for a consensus \(Ref 2,4,5\). This meant that disputes about contentious issues such as non\-monotonic dose\-response relationships need not complicate the development of criteria for EDC identification, as these relate to hazard characterisation and risk assessment, not hazard identification. Accordingly, differences in opinion regarding the existence of non\-monotonic dose\-response curves were revealed as irrelevant for identifying EDCs and could thus be neutralised. This new principle was offered as the basis for a consensus among scientists with diverging views on endocrine disruption. 

 To reach a consensus, Kortenkamp and Jobling initiated a workshop with international scientists engaged in the dispute. It was held under the auspices of the German Federal Institute of Risk Assessment, the government body dealing with chemical risk assessment, in Berlin, Germany, 11\-12 April 2016. Kortenkamp drafted the blueprint for this consensus, which was presented at the workshop, chaired by the former Chief Scientific Adviser to the President of the European Commission, Prof Anne Glover. A consensus about the scientific principles of defining EDC criteria was reached and published as a paper \(Ref 6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The consensus reached at the Berlin workshop put European Commission decision makers in a position to deliver on legal obligations to protect the 445,000,000 EU citizens against the harmful effects of EDCs in pesticides and biocides. This provided the foundations for improving the safe use of such products where endocrine disruption was not previously considered as a form of harm. It gives manufacturers the certainty needed for developing safer products in compliance with EU law on biocides and pesticides. 

 As the European Commission takes steps not only to deal with pesticides and biocides, but also to regulate endocrine disrupting properties of industrial chemicals and substances used as food additives or personal care product ingredients, the new regulatory principles for EDCs begin to radiate out into other regulatory domains. 

 In 2013, the European Commission started the regulatory process with an impact assessment on defining the scientific criteria, in which several regulatory options were set out \(Comm 2016\). The impact assessment was not completed in time to meet a legally binding deadline \(December 2013\) and even continued until 2016, leading to a case brought by Sweden to the European Court of Justice. 

 The April 2016 “Berlin consensus” initiated by Kortenkamp and Jobling created an environment in which it became possible to realise the protection of people from harmful effects of EDCs. The President of the German Federal Institute of Risk Assessment, Professor Andreas Hensel, declared the consensus a “ **breakthrough in the scientific discussion on endocrine disruptors and of great importance for the consumer health protection in Europe**” \(S1\). 

 As an immediate and direct consequence of the consensus, the European Commission abandoned one option \(option 4\) of their impact assessment. If not withdrawn, this option would have weakened protection from EDCs in the EU. A Commission executive summary of the impact assessment, published as a staff document \(S2\) noted \(page 2\): “ **Recent scientific consensus made evident that Option 4 could no longer be pursued from a scientific point of view, although it is supported by some stakeholders and member states**”. 

 The way was free to implement science\-based regulatory criteria for EDCs and to provide the foundations for protection of human health and the environment from harmful effects of EDCs in pesticides and biocides. 

 In replacing intermediate regulatory criteria for EDCs which targeted substances classed as carcinogens or reproductive toxicants, the consensus improved the quality of the regulation by providing the principles for directly addressing endocrine disruption. The intermediate criteria would have led to restrictions for many chemicals which in fact do not pose endocrine disrupting harm. This situation would have compromised acceptance of EU law and would have disoriented manufacturers. 

 The new criteria were enshrined in the form of Delegated Regulations, first for biocides in 2017 \(S3\), then for pesticides in 2018 \(S4\). 

 The Delegated Regulations implemented the provisions for health protection against EDCs that are laid down in the EU Biocidal Product Regulation and the Plant Protection Product Regulation. These provisions stipulate that manufacturers can only place active biocidal or pesticidal substances with endocrine disrupting properties on the EU market if risks \(biocides\) or exposures \(pesticides\) are minimal. Without the development of regulatory criteria for EDCs these legal obligations could not have been realized and the protection of human health and the environment from harm through EDC exposures would have been delayed.

Recent analyses of the EDC literature have been criticized for failing to use transparent and objective approaches to draw conclusions about the strength of evidence linking EDC exposures to adverse health or environmental outcomes. Systematic review methodologies are ideal for addressing this issue as they provide transparent and consistent approaches to study selection and evaluation. Objective methods are needed for integrating the multiple streams of evidence (epidemiology, wildlife, laboratory animal, in vitro, and in silico data) that are relevant in assessing EDCs.MethodsWe have developed a framework for the systematic review and integrated assessment (SYRINA) of EDC studies. The framework was designed for use with the International Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS) and World Health Organization (WHO) definition of an EDC, which requires appraisal of evidence regarding 1) association between exposure and an adverse effect, 2) association between exposure and endocrine disrupting activity, and 3) a plausible link between the adverse effect and the endocrine disrupting activity.ResultsBuilding from existing methodologies for evaluating and synthesizing evidence, the SYRINA framework includes seven steps: 1) Formulate the problem; 2) Develop the review protocol; 3) Identify relevant evidence; 4) Evaluate evidence from individual studies; 5) Summarize and evaluate each stream of evidence; 6) Integrate evidence across all streams; 7) Draw conclusions, make recommendations, and evaluate uncertainties. The proposed method is tailored to the IPCS/WHO definition of an EDC but offers flexibility for use in the context of other definitions of EDCs.ConclusionsWhen using the SYRINA framework, the overall objective is to provide the evidence base needed to support decision making, including any action to avoid/minimise potential adverse effects of exposures. This framework allows for the evaluation and synthesis of evidence from multiple evidence streams. Finally, a decision regarding regulatory action is not only dependent on the strength of evidence, but also the consequences of action/inaction, e.g. limited or weak evidence may be sufficient to justify action if consequences are serious or irreversible.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Laura N.', 'last_name': 'Vandenberg', 'initials': None, 'researcher_id':

“endocrine disruptors” (EDs), trigger adverse health effects by disrupting the endogenous hormone system. There is need to harmonize guidance on the regulation of EDs, but this has been hampered by what appeared as a lack of consensus among scientists. This publication provides summary information about a consensus reached by a group of world-leading scientists that can serve as the basis for the development of ED criteria in relevant EU legislation. Twenty-three international scientists from different disciplines discussed principles and open questions on ED identification as outlined in a draft consensus paper at an expert meeting hosted by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) in Berlin, Germany on 11–12 April 2016. Participants reached a consensus regarding scientific principles for the identification of EDs. The paper discusses the consensus reached on background, definition of an ED and related concepts, sources of uncertainty, scientific principles important for ED identification, and research needs. It highlights the difficulty in retrospectively reconstructing ED exposure, insufficient range of validated test systems for EDs, and some issues impacting on the evaluation of the risk from EDs, such as non-monotonic dose–response and thresholds, modes of action, and exposure assessment. This report provides the consensus statement on EDs agreed among all participating scientists. The meeting facilitated a productive debate and reduced a number of differences in views. It is expected that the consensus reached will serve as an important basis for the development of regulatory ED criteria.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Roland', 'last_name':

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Since 2008, Prof. Barn and colleagues have been researching the use of mobile apps in a variety of social care settings. This research has focused on marginalised young people in conflict with the law leading to the UK’s first mobile app to support Youth offending teams in the work with young people in the youth justice system.  National impacts included: The mobile app was developed through a co\-design process that generated impact of engagement of young people in the design, development and deployment of social technology. The MAYOT app is embedded in the strategy for West Mercia YoS. The app has been deployed and is in use in at Bromley Youth Offending Service by 25 case workers. A third Youth Offending Service, Essex YoS is in the process of finalising deployment before March 2021. Additionally, the co\-design methodology is embedded in the design practice of an international software development house.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Middlesex Computer Science undertakes leading research in technology for social good. The research undertaken for the impacts reported in this case study is an example of multi\-disciplinary research with contributions from computer science, social policy and criminology. The research has been reported in leading international outlets over the research period of 2006 through to 2020. 

 Prof. Barn began work in the field of app development for social care settings in 2006 with app development for nurses. Applied research in social care education settings was further developed under another JISC funded project in support of social workers. The latter project was instrumental in exposing the importance of understanding users and how users interact and work with mobile devices in challenging settings. A second outcome was the importance of inter\-disciplinary approaches to solution development. 

 Knowledge of the important role of mobile technology in their relationship to young people, was further enhanced through a research consultancy project funded by the Association of Chief Police Officers.  Here, research elaborated a detailed understanding of the relationship between young people and mobile technology. Outputs from the research addressed the risk\-taking behaviours of young people and were published in the Core\-A\-ranked Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences HICSS \[R1\]. This research was conducted in conjunction with Royal Holloway, University of London. An early insight from this research was the understanding that social care was critically neglected in terms of benefiting from advances in mobile technology. 

 This new understanding led to a proposal being submitted to the Nominet Trust in 2012 and awarded in 2013 as the MAYOT project \(Mobile Apps for Youth Offending Teams\) and conducted from 2013\-2016. The research performed as part of this project developed a personalised mobile app for use by young people and their case workers in youth offending teams. 

 In the youth justice sector, Youth Offending teams were set up following the 1998 Crime & Disorder Act and comprise multi\-agency teams coordinated by a local authority. YOTs work with young people on a range of community orders. At the initiation of this research \(2013\), there were over 20000 first time entrants into the youth system. Further, there 66,430 young people forming the case load of YOTs nationally \(Data available from 2012\). To ease this workload, we envisaged the use of a smartphone app to support interactions between case workers and young people. 

 Requirements for the app were elicited through the instigation of a value sensitive co\-design approach where young people, their managers worked in close conjunction with the research team. The research was innovative in the use of such a methodology with a marginalised section of the community. 

 The sensitivity of the problem domain and the nature of the end\-users, young people in the youth justice system, meant that value sensitive concerns were brought to the fore and in particular, issues such as privacy, security, autonomy and transparency were quickly established as critical. As a result, our research contributed a conceptual model for value sensitive concerns published in the Software Engineering in Society Track at the premier international software engineering conference, ICSE \[R2\]. This topic has subsequently become an important research area. An approach to early identification of value sensitive concerns using Floridi’s Informational Privacy theory was described in the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing \(SAC\) paper \[R3\]. More complex relationships between such concerns and desirable attributes such as resilience have also been illustrated \[R4 – an extended paper of work first presented at the core ranked A conference, European Conference on Information Systems \(ECIS\). The value sensitive co\-design approach was further adopted by a boutique software development company specializing in app development. 

 Reflecting on the interdisciplinary nature of the research, and the interplay between research and impact, research conducted during the deployment of the MAYOT app also addressed the impact of such technology on both case workers and young people. Techno\-habitats of practitioners were explored in \[R5\]. 

 The conceptual model of values is particularly important as it provides an important bridgehead between software engineering practice and non\-functional requirements and has formed a substantive body of research reported elsewhere. Notably, we have also demonstrated how values can be more formally accounted for to support the design of resilient information systems. \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impacts arising from this research are an example of close integration between research and practice. Impacts occurred both during the research process and from the outcomes of the research. The impact from the research has ranged from policy/strategy, public education and impact on the growth of an international SME working in the social enterprise sector. 

####  Policy and Strategy 

 The reach of our work is potentially significant with a total of 153 youth offending teams in England and Wales. In March 2016, a total of 27,900 young people \(aged 10\-17\) were convicted and sentenced by the courts \(YJB, 2017\). The vast majority of such young people are supervised in the community by the 12,000 personnel in Youth Offending Teams \(YOTs\). There are 153 multi\-agency teams YOTs with representation from the police, probation, education, health and social services. The service also includes specialist workers, such as mental health practitioners, and substance misuse workers. 

 Our advocacy of the use of mobile technology \(the MAYOT app\) was embedded in the 2015\-16 strategy of one large youth offending service, Worcestershire and Herefordshire YoS \(now West Mercia YoS\) \[S1\] as an example of innovative practice for engagement and dialogue between the case worker and the young person. 

 Before the app can be deployed in Youth Offending Service setting, staff undergo a rigorous training programme. Our conceptual and methodological training programme that focuses on the ethics of using social technology to promote engagement and empowerment in young offenders has been delivered to 20 YOTs in England and Wales in urban \(e.g. London, Bradford, Leeds, and Newcastle\), and rural \(e.g. Worcestershire, Oxfordshire, and Cumbria\) settings \[S4\]. 

 The overarching and monitoring government body, the Youth Justice Board \(YJB\), has recognised the value and potential of our technology. In 2017, following a meeting between one of the co\-investigators of the MAYOT project the then Parliamentary Under\-secretary of State for Justice, Dr Phillip Lee invited the project team to contact the Youth Justice Board formally, to discuss our approach and update the YJB on the aims of the MAYOT app \[S9\]. The meeting took place on 29th November 2018 and included our deployment partners from the Youth Offending Services of West Mercia and Bromley. More recently, discussions have re\-started and with the YJB and they are now considering an option to take ownership of the MAYOT technology to support wider deployment. 

 Further engagement with UK Government has also taken place through interactions with the Home Office. Following the rise in knife crime statistics in March 2019, the MAYOT team, along with the software development partner, GNB, met with the Home Office to elaborate how the MAYOT app could be used in the fight against knife crime. The team was invited to submit a proposal to evidence how the app could be applied in this setting by Tom McDonald from the Home Office. 

 The value of the app to the YoS was first noted by the Head of London Triborough YoS, who noted that the co\-design process used by the team “helped develop confidence in our young people”.  The senior leader was further was clear that: “The use of the MAYOT app encourages and supports positive engagement with young people and could reduce further offending by providing key information that young people may need such as what to do if you are arrested or drug information.” \[S7\]. 

 The senior leader recognised the importance of such technology and when they moved to Bromley YOS, the team was again approached for engagement at Bromley. 

 In Autumn 2019, Bromley YOS agreed to adopt the MAYOT technology for use in the service. Dedicated training sessions to the entire Youth Offending Team and supporting services was provided \(October 2019\). \(Letter of support/evidence: \[S7\]\). Full deployment was planned for spring 2020 but has been impacted by the COVID\-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions. A further deployment is now scheduled for February 2021. 

 Between July and October 2020, the Head of Western Essex YoS, responded to an Innovation call by Essex YoS and proposed the use of apps in a youth justice setting. Realising that such an app already existed, asked for MAYOT to be used at Western Region of Essex YoS. Training sessions for 8 case workers managing around 70 young people are scheduled for March 2021 with a deployment of the app planned for March 2021.  The COVID\-19 pandemic has resulted in further delays. The Essex YoS has produced a compelling video available as source \[S8\]. Confirmation of the Essex YoS deployment plan is noted in source \[S3\]. 

####  Stakeholder Engagement 

 We have worked with a range of key stakeholders through the entire design process. A key concern in the adoption of technology in challenging work environments, is the involvement of stakeholders. We instigated a co\-design approach where case workers, managers \(combined total, 17\) and most importantly, the young people \(10\) were first class designers in the design processes used in the development of the MAYOT app. These were spread across three Youth Offending Services in England \(London Triborough YoS, Hereford and Worcester YoS, and Oxfordshire YoS\). 

 The voices of young people were central to the design of the app, their engagement in the co\-design was an important characteristic and at times contradicted other stakeholders in the process such as magistrates. The co\-design process ensured that all stakeholders were represented through the app. This tension of multiple views was a significant research outcome and has been documented in \[R4, R5, R6\]. 

 Following availability of the app, a Train the Trainer workshop aimed at developing digital expertise in the use of the app, was delivered to all YoS in England, interested in attending. This workshop was attended by 21 case workers and their managers from 17 different YoS \[S4\]. In 2016, Further training was delivered to the Welsh Youth Offending Services:  Monmouthshire & Torfaen, and Cwm Taf. 

 The professional body for Youth Offending team managers \( [https://aym.org.uk](https://aym.org.uk/)\) requested a contribution in the form of  a short article for their regular magazine. The article is available in reference \[S5\]. Similarly, Magistrates form another critical set of stakeholders. In February 2015, we were invited to present to a meeting of 20 magistrates from Worcestershire. Following a detailed discussion, we were invited to contribute a short article for their newsletter \(See Reference \[S2\]\). Both articles are an example of knowledge transfer to communities outside the academic sector. 

####  International Reach 

 There has been international component to the impact. In 2016, The novelty and value of the work was identified by researchers at the University of Copenhagen who invited members of the team to join a research team seeking funding from the Innovation Fund of Denmark to address similar concerns in that country. 

####  Human, Economic and Technological Impact 

 The project has had two further impacts. Firstly, value\-sensitive design and co\-design is essential practice where end\-users are from marginalised communities. This has manifested itself through human, personal development. The lead developer on the original MAYOT project, Mr Lalith Athiappan gained significant requirements gathering and development experience and user interface design skills such that he was instrumental to a successful KTP proposal \(No. KTP010041\) working with a social enterprise Global Notice Board \( [http://www.gnb.com](http://www.gnb.com/)\). 

 Athiappan was able to apply the good practice design guidelines and the ability to design for different types of end\-users to develop a look and feel for user interface platform for use for a commercially available estate agents app that was derived from his experience on the MAYOT app. He was also able to use his development experience from the MAYOT project to contribute towards the establishment of a software development team in India that specifically serviced the social enterprise \(GNB\) in London. In February 2018, Prof. B. Barn delivered a workshop on value sensitive design for mobile apps to the software development in India, emphasising the importance of understanding users in the co\-design process and how values underpin acceptance of technology when working with marginalised users \[S6/S5\].

 “Innovative Practice: The YOS has been working with a multi\-disciplinary academic team from Middlesex University and Royal Holloway University of London in piloting the Mobile Application for Youth Offending Teams \(MAYOT\). MAYOT is a smart phone application that provides a common platform for engagement and dialogue between the case worker and young person. The application allows communication around key activities, reminders for appointments, the provision of information and an activity meter/progress chart. Team members and young people from the South Worcestershire Team have been involved during 2014/15 in the iterative co\- design and testing of the application. There are now twelve YOTs either using or planning to use the MAYOT application \(Worcestershire Youth Justice Plan 2015\-16: 8\)”. \(See page 8 of PDF\). 

 March 2015, we were invited to contribute a short article to the Magistrates Association newsletter. In the words of one magistrate: ‘I was very interested to hear about the introduction of the MAYOT pilot study for young offenders. A mobile phone app that can remind these youngsters of important dates, key activities, even exclusion zone and progress on a court order can only help with compliance. It’s an exciting development in the communication process between young offender and caseworker.’ \(Worcester magistrate\).

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Through the process of unpicking existing hierarchies surrounding art practice, research carried out between 2014 and 2020 by Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd at Bath Spa University has impacted positively on participants’ and audiences’ involvement and connection with art. At least 250 participants, including engineers, automotive workers, studio assistants and gallery assistants, who traditionally work behind the scenes have been placed at the centre of their research, impacting on their visibility and recognition, and breaking down the notion of the artist as a single author. One participant said that collaborating on a research project with Harrison was a “momentous” experience that “shone a light into my life”, leading to a realisation that “I could go and share my skills with people”. These researchers have brought a minimum of 200,000 people \(between 2014 and 2020\) into direct encounters with art objects and with the process of making art, resulting in new, expanded understandings of what constitutes art and creating new relationships between audiences and art practice *.* 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 How does the perception and practice of art change when the processes, materials and individuals involved in its making and maintenance are made visible? Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd have examined these questions together, through a process of extending and interrogating each other’s research practices. Their interactions and connections have been strengthened by a network of relationships with curators and galleries as they work together through new understandings of creating and exhibiting objects. Their research is practice\-led and is focused in three areas: 

###  **Art as process** 

 Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd are concerned with art that invites viewers and participants into conversation with the moment of action. This contrasts with and challenges the traditional notion of an artwork as a finished item or a ‘full stop’. 

 Research by Kidd and Harrison has exposed hidden processes, bringing the act of making out of the studio or the factory and into public view. Kidd brings the process of covering the canvas with paint into the gallery setting \(R6\). Her automated paintings systems or machines \(2014\-2018\) use arterial systems of pipes and pumps to fill paintings from the inside or to drip paint over their surfaces, deferring the application of the paint and the completion of the works. Harrison’s *Heavy Rock* \(2014\-2015; R4\) made public the casting and installation of a 100\-tonne concrete wave breaker at the entrance to Plymouth Sound. Hydrophones cast inside the wave breaker animated the concrete block, relaying the sound of the waves back to the gallery setting. These works foreground the ongoing nature of the object and the process of making art, as well as challenging the boundaries between art and industrial processes. 

 Both Kidd and Dunseath have interrogated the studio as the site of making and have challenged the notion of ‘the exhibition’ as a display of finished artworks. *Curious about Care* presented the act of making the ‘paintings’ within the exhibition space \(R6\), while *Elbow* \(2015; R2\) involved transforming a gallery space into a studio environment through which artists came and went, leaving traces of their activities. Through their research, Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd are working to break down the division between making and exhibiting. 

###  Learning with materials 

 Through an emphasis on art as process Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd have created new relationships with their materials. Rather than seeking to impose forms or meanings onto materials, their research is centred on learning with materials and matter, as well as enabling audiences and participants to learn and engage with materials in new ways. 

 Harrison is concerned with the unpredictability of materials. Within his research he works with materials, skilled workers and participants/audience members, creating acts of enquiry and experimentation. In this way, he has explored the effect of sound on ceramics \( *Material Soundsystems,* 2014\-2020; R5\), the live firing of clay objects  and the behaviour of automotive clay models \( *Joyride*, 2016\-2017; R3\). The transformation of the materials is witnessed in public, by artist and participants/audience, creating shared moments in which new knowledge about materials and their potential are revealed. 

 Kidd’s painting machines also act as learning resources, as the audience and team tasked to care for them are drawn into the process of making, looking, and talking ‘with’. Dunseath’s research emphasises the ways in which materials play an active role in the creation of a work of art, demonstrating how a material can force a sculptor to bring together multiple studio assistants, with different skills, experiences and understandings \(R1\). 

###  Challenging the perception of the artist as single author. 

 An emphasis on process and materials is tied to a questioning of the perception of the artist as single author. What happens when the idea of a ‘single author’ is broken down and questioned? 

 Harrison’s collaboration with materials and skilled workers with specialist knowledge \(eg casting concrete blocks\) challenges the distinction between studio and industrial processes, and questions perceptions of material as ‘high’ or ‘low’. By basing participants’ roles on their own ‘normal’ work, Harrison’s research creates space for those people \(and challenges the audience\) to reappraise the value and status of their skills and abilities. Addressing the roles of studio assistants working for Sir Anthony Caro \(1924\-2013; an artist who played a pivotal role in the development of 20<sup>th</sup> century sculpture\), Dunseath’s *Artist Boss* \(2014\-2017\) also asks whether identifying Studio Assistants changes the reading of works of art \(R1\). Kidd’s research makes visible the importance of gallery staff to the exhibition of artworks and challenges hierarchies. 

 Questioning the perception of the artist as single author brings its own challenge for the researchers. Are they complicit with a system that prefers to focus on a single named artist? Is their work with undervalued and unseen individuals effective in breaking down hierarchies? What are the consequences of breaking down notions of authorship? The researchers are aware of the tensions involved in making use of other people in the creation of their work, and continue to debate these tensions and to develop research projects that address these complex issues. 

###  Outcomes 

 As a result of their research, Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd have developed new understandings of materials, processes and objects, and of the relationships people have with art objects, allowing them to create exhibitions and events in which participants and audiences engage directly with objects and processes. Their research into the making of objects has highlighted the range of individuals involved in the creation and presentation of art; making hierarchies within the discipline visible has resulted in them being challenged and changed.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd’s research has unpicked the hierarchies that surround the making and exhibition of art and has impacted on the awareness of the range and value of the work done by skilled individuals, including studio assistants and gallery assistants, within the discipline. Their research has also made a difference to the ways in which audiences relate to and engage with art, allowing them to be involved in the production of art objects, rather than having them mediated through explanatory texts or educational resources. The impact of the research by this group of artists is focused in two areas: increasing visibility and recognition for a range of individuals involved in making and caring for art; and bringing audiences into contact with the process of making art objects. 

###  Increasing visibility and recognition for a range of individuals involved in making and caring for art 

 Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd have made a significant impact on understandings of who makes and maintains works of art, and how specific roles \(eg artist, studio assistant, gallery assistant\) are perceived in relation to one another. Greater understanding of these roles and of specialist skills and knowledge, on which artists and their works of art depend, has raised the profile of studio assistants, engineers, gallery assistants and skilled industry workers, as well as aiding the process of picking apart hierarchies within art practice. 

 *Artist Boss* \(2014\-17\) made visible the role of Sir Anthony Caro’s assistants in the making of sculptures, questioning traditional ideas of ownership and authorship. This piece of research \(interviews with 20 studio assistants; 3 exhibitions with over 1400 visitors; E5, E8\) brought to light the collaborations and activities behind the finished works of art. Artistic Director at the Royal Academy of Arts said the research “illustrates how ideas can take shape collaboratively whilst raising important questions on issues such as individuality and authenticity of the pieces” \(E5\). A testimonial from an Arts Advisor/Art Trustee acknowledges the rise in demand for skilled assistants and technicians in recent years, and states that by **“looking specifically at the role of the artist’s assistant \[Artist Boss\] opens up an important discussion about a particular aspect of art production that continues to be largely overlooked”** \(E5\). 

 Harrison’s research has made audiences and reviewers appreciative of participants’ \(including bus drivers, engineers and automotive industry workers\) deep experience and knowledge; an artist\-writer who attended Conductor highlighted the actions of the “ **skilled drivers**” who manoeuvred 32 buses to “perform slowly choreographed movements from the bus bays and across the forecourt” \(2019, Preston Bus Station and *The Harris Museum & Art Gallery*, Preston; 32 drivers, 8 volunteer performers, bus station manager, 8 event marshalls; audience of 200 at performance; 8000 views online; 15,000 visitors to the exhibition; E7, p1; E8\). 

 The act of taking part in Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd’s research has also impacted positively on individuals’ understandings of their own practice, skills and employment. The skilled individuals involved in *Heavy Rock* \(including 2 block casters, 20 Dockyard Diving Team, 24\-piece Royal Marine Band, 2 Babcock Marine engineers, Queen’s Harbour Master, Marine Sound Engineer, Sound engineer, Metal\-Wood fabricator; E3; E8\) and *Joyride* \(including 1 car model maker, 6 ramp builders, 20 volunteer event marshalls; E4; E8\) saw their skills and knowledge being celebrated and placed at the centre of the research. One former model maker at Longbridge Car Factory and co\-maker of the clay Rover 75 central to Joyride, said that taking part in the project had “made me look at the arts in a different way”, and had allowed him to think of car models, once carved from mahogany, as works of art \(E4\). Participating in *Joyride* opened up new possibilities and activities, including a serious \(and continued\) interest in making pottery, and presenting as a keynote speaker in an academic conference \(2017\). He described the keynote as “a tremendous experience” and said that, while sitting around the table with a group of professors, **“I felt as an equal…I was part of the discussion”** \(E4\). 

 A former studio assistant and artist who participated in Artist Boss, talked about the impact of the research on peoples’ perceptions of studio assistants, noting that the Artist Boss Roche Court exhibition had presented studio assistants as **“artists in our own right”** and had “ **re\-examined us, and presented us as equals**” \(E5\). The research had a direct impact on his own career, as the Roche Court exhibition had “spurred me into doing something quite experimental… a departure from how I was normally working”, leading to the creation of a sculpture that was subsequently selected for the Frieze Sculpture Park \(2017\): “ **which is probably the most high profile thing I’ve done and put me in the international art scene**” \(E5\). The *Artist Boss* publication \(2016; more than 400 copies sold\) has helped to increase visibility of studio assistants and has impacted on assistants’ own perceptions of the work that they do \(E5\). 

 Meanwhile, gallery assistants caring for Kidd’s painting machines noticed a shift in visitors’ attitudes towards them, as well as changing the nature of their role in the gallery \(E1\). An assistant at *Test Run* \(2014, Modern Art Oxford, 11,814 visitors; E8\) said that “seeing that the invigilator is actively involved in the process of the work” caused “a greater intrigue and social involvement from the viewers”, while their task of maintaining the paintings “shifted me away from the usual invigilator role” \(E1, p1\). This was echoed at Sullivan Galleries, Chicago, where a minimum of 40 gallery assistants who were involved in caring for the works “were often asked about the work” and found this to be a “profoundly positive consequence” of the works’ “unusual nature” \(2016, Painting in Time II, 20,608 visitors; E1; E8\). 

 As well as impacting on artists, makers and assistants, visitors to the exhibitions and participants in outreach and education programmes gained a greater understanding of collaboration within art practice and acquired knowledge of formerly unknown career opportunities and ways of working. A former art student who took part in the Artist Boss engagement programme said that the research “gave me new insight into how artists navigated their careers, how important other people were to their practice”, while another said: “Artist Boss opened my eyes to the idea of making work that wasn't just my own or for myself” \(E5\). These insights opened up new avenues of professional practice and potential careers for students, including art school technician, furniture maker and studio assistant \(E5\). Testimonials from these alumni demonstrate the lasting impact of the research on their careers, with one saying that: “Artist Boss recognised that this IS a way of living for an artist, and I concur. The influence and physicality of being around working artists and making work for others feeds your own creativity”, while another said that Artist Boss “has continued to influence my studio practice as a multidisciplinary artist” \(E5\). 

###  Bringing audiences into contact with the process of making art objects 

### -  creating new understandings of exhibiting and making art 

### -  creating new understandings of materials and new relationships between objects, materials, makers, carers and audiences 

 Research carried out by Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd has brought audiences closer to the processes and materials involved in the making of art, and in doing so has succeeded in breaking down the distance between art object and audience, as well as expanding and enriching audiences’ understanding of what constitutes a work of art or an exhibition. 

 A visitor to *Elbow* \(2015, C&C gallery, London; 1 blind consultant and 1 assistant, 1 gallery assistant, 2 gallery directors, 2 marketing staff; 400 participants by active involvement, 4230 live audience, 10,000 online, E8\) commented: “Nice to see a gallery looking at disability as an issue rather than just showing paintings, I didn’t know art could do that” *,* while another stated “I really enjoyed learning how the process came about and that the focus is on the process itself rather than what they are making” \(E2, p1\). These comments demonstrate that the research altered visitors’ understanding of art and challenged their notions of exhibiting and making art \(E2\). 

 Dunseath’s outreach and participation work as part of *Artist Boss* has impacted on students’ and teachers’ understandings of materials, technologies, and collaborations \(workshops, crits and talks, over 690 students, teachers and pupils; E2, E5\). Art students responded to technical discussions of joining and making, with one commenting: “Before this project I had not seen how new technologies were being used in art”, while another said: “It supported my interest in sculpture, and supported it as a viable approach. How artists are using, interpreting or trying to push the parameters of a new technology, process or material” \(E5\). Encounters with new materials, technologies and artists impacted on these art students’ perception of the discipline and their own professional practice. 

 By bringing gallery visitors and participants into direct contact with materials and their transformations, Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd’s research allows them to play a part in witnessing and creating new knowledge and new understandings. An artist\-writer’s account of Kidd’s *Overfill* \( *Painting in Time*, The Tetley, 2015; 6149 visitors, E8\) discussed the relationship between art object, materials, studio assistant and audience: “the gallery attendants become implicated in the work, the paintings ‘marked’ by their ‘care’ and in a sense becoming ‘documents’ of this ‘care’ – the visitor taking on the role of witness within this process” \(E1\). Director of Exhibition Operations at the Chicago exhibition said that Kidd’s work succeeded in engaging with its audience “in its making” and continues to do so “in the memory of that making”, while a studio assistant at The Tetley said the work had a **“live\-ness”** and **“sparked a real material interest from audiences, an inquisitiveness, curiosity, playful”** \(E1\). 

 Visitors to Mute \(2015, National Museum Wales; 45,775 visitors, E8\) were actively involved in the exhibition, being invited to play brass music from 2 turntables into slip\-filled speakers, with the aim of breaking down the clay and exposing the internal sound. Over the course of the exhibition, visitors added to the record collection on display. Artists, writers, students and photographers who visited the exhibition were moved to write about and share images and videos of Mute; one wrote about how the installation “invites the public” to take part, saying: “being invited to make a load of noise on turntables is always a fun proposition, and I can now \(technically\) claim to have DJd the National Museum of Wales\!” \(E6, p1\). Another visitor, who took along some of his noisiest records to play, witnessed the “deterioration of these ceramics plates through sound” and said “I think it’s the most fun I had all year” \(E6, p1\). These comments demonstrate the interactive and joyful experience of engaging with this artwork, which turned the gallery from a place of quiet, distant contemplation to one of welcoming interaction. 

 As well as creating new ways of engaging with art practice and shifting perceptions of authorship and hierarchy in art, Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd have effected changes in the programming and curating of cultural events. Plymouth City’s Plan for Public Art \(2016\) cites Harrison’s work as a case study that demonstrates “the capacity of the city and the city’s artists to produce ambitious work” \(E3\). A city council commissioned report \(2016\) found that Heavy Rock’s collaborative approach had resulted in Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery creating “valuable new partnerships with a range of organisations in the city, including the Royal Navy and the marine engineers, Babcock International”, while the project had also “forged new working relations between the museum and the visual arts community in the city” \(E3\).

The ‘Shop of Possibilities’ (SoP), an art- and play-space commissioned by the South London Gallery (SLG) improved the development of 484 children, provided training for education professionals, and employment opportunities. The SoP was cited as best-practice in an independent report advising the Greater London Authority, garnering an additional £873,299 investment for the project. Hafeda’s work with Roma communities in Portugal inspired new community-led mediations to improve community relations. Hafeda’s work has inspired artists and curators working with marginalised communities elsewhere. For example, social artworks commissioned in marginalised communities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and for refugee children in Lebanon on the Syrian border. The projects have helped develop social and creative skills among 696 children, young people, and adults, empowering them to assert their rights and opinions by contributing to permanent social infrastructures.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The work of Scottish feminist photographer Franki Raffles \(1955\-1994\) constitutes an important contribution to Scottish 20th century cultural history. Due to her early death this contribution was in danger of being forgotten. Research by Edinburgh Napier University has led to a new appreciation of Raffles and has prevented her work from remaining hidden. The creation of an archive website has brought her work to public attention, and through exhibitions and publications her place has been re\-established in the history of photography. 

 The research has: 

 **Contributed to Scottish Visual Cultural History** – conservation of Raffles’ work has ensured that a vital contribution to Scottish Visual Culture has been preserved. This is reflected by the archive’s influence on filmmakers, art galleries and creative organisations, as well as the family of Franki Raffles. 

 **Engaged New Audiences in Feminist Photography** \- over 20,500 views have been recorded by the new archive which resulted from this research. Over 5,000 people attended exhibitions of Raffles work in 2016\-17. 

 **Brought new attention to Women’s Right’s charity ‘Zero Tolerance’** \- the research has engaged with the charity, originally set up by Raffles, and has continued raising awareness of male violence against women. A new body of work has been commissioned by the charity, inspired by Raffles’ original campaign images. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Born in 1955, Franki Raffles was a leading participant in the Women’s Liberation movement. Franki moved to Edinburgh from the Isle of Lewis in 1983 and began her career as a freelance photographer with an exhibition entitled ‘Lewis Women’. Over the next two years, Raffles travelled to Zimbabwe, the Soviet Union, China, Tibet, India, Hong Kong and the Philippines, capturing images of women’s lives and work across borders.  She then returned to Edinburgh to document women participating in the 1986 Edinburgh Commonwealth Games, and local women at work. In 1989, following her international project photographing women workers in Russia, Georgia and Ukraine, Raffles established the Scottish Zero Tolerance charity, with a public campaign of her black and white photographs and accompanying text raising awareness of male violence against women. In the early 1990s Raffles undertook a project titled ‘Lot’s Wife’, photographing Soviet Jewish immigrant women who had resettled in Israel, unfinished at the time of her untimely death in December 1994. 

 Dr Alistair Scott is an Associate Professor at Edinburgh Napier University, where he has been employed since March 2009. This research has all been led by Scott at Edinburgh Napier University and the archive is housed at the special collections archive at The University of St Andrews. Research began in 2012 when Scott became aware that Raffles’ contribution was not included in recent surveys of Scottish photography, such as Tom Normand’s 2007 book, ‘Scottish Photography: A History’, which aims to provide a complete historical narrative. Given Scott’s knowledge of Raffles’ photographic practice, the absence of her contribution from surveys such as this underlined an urgent need for a re\-evaluation of her work. 

 In 2012 Scott established contact with Raffles’ partner, Sandy Lunan. This resulted in the re\-discovery of an extensive hidden archive in danger of being abandoned. Scott conducted an audit to gain an overview of the collection, including photographs, negatives, notebooks and diaries, and gathered together Raffles’ entire photographic practice from the early 1980s until her death in 1994. After gaining consent from her Estate, Scott began the process of examining the work, establishing a timeline, identifying her commissions, projects and themes, and started to select and digitise key images. Funded by an Edinburgh Napier University small research grant, Scott led the design of a website as a way to interpret, publicise and disseminate this research and visual material **\[R1\].** 

 An important aim of the research, in addition to the preservation and exhibition of Raffles’ work, was to provide additional contextual information. To gather new primary evidence of Raffles’ working practice, in 2015 Scott filmed 10 interviews with people with in\-depth personal knowledge of the 11 bodies of work that the research had identified. The interviews included Sandy Lunan who had travelled with Raffles, and Evelyn Gillan who had worked closely on all the Edinburgh Women’s Committee projects and the establishment of ‘Zero Tolerance’. These interviews are presented in 7 short contextual films which are embedded in the website **\[R1\].** In this way the website gives a detailed introduction to Raffles photographic practice, includes biographical information, curates the work into 11 thematic areas, provides appropriate contextual interpretation, and presents edited material from the new primary research. The site also collates publications, posters, and interview transcripts. 

 The research which underpinned the creation of the website **\[R1\],** provided Scott with a complete record of Raffles’ work. Based on this Scott exhibited a retrospective selection of Raffles’ work at the first St Andrews Photography Festival in 2016 **\[R2\],** and at the Reid Gallery, Glasgow School of Art, during March and April 2017 **\[R4\].** The work was also published by the Scottish Society for the History of Photography in 2017 **\[R3\],** and was presented at an international conference focusing on women’s photography in Vilnius in 2017 **\[R5\].** A multicomponent electronic portfolio has been created to bring together and contextualise the various strands of the body of research **\[R6\].**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This research has resulted in Franki Raffles’ complete photographic practice being preserved and archived. It has also uncovered the contextual detail of the creative practices she developed and has allowed key works to be exhibited to the public. The re\-evaluation and dissemination of this body of work has: 

 **Contributed to Scottish Visual Cultural History** 

 This research has protected and publicised the work one of Scotland’s most important women photographers, and has become an important Cultural Resource. While undertaking the research, Scott searched to find a home for the archive in order that it could be safely preserved in perpetuity. Using a prototype website, Scott was able to make the case to St Andrews that they should provide this home. The website was launched to the public on International Women’s Day 8 March 2016 **\[R1\]**. It is publicly accessible and to date there have been over 20,500 views. A statement from Mark Cousins, filmmaker and writer, explains how the availability of Raffles’ work has influenced him and wider visual culture; *“It is difficult to overstate the value of Edinburgh Napier University’s Research Project, The Franki Raffles Archive.  It has recuperated, evaluated, contextualised and made available the work of a key figure in Scottish and visual culture of the 80s and 90s. The website has brought to attention the range of her photography, travel and approaches”* **\[C5\].** 

 Scott’s approach to cataloguing Raffles’ creative practice led to its preservation in the leading specialist archive at St Andrews University. The techniques used to compile it have been adopted by that institution for future interpretation work. The Photographic Archive Manager of the University Library Special Collections: noted *“These catalogue records and digital files formed the basis for all later collections work at St. Andrews \[…\] Future plans \[…\] include a selection of the Franki Raffles Collection to be displayed within the permanent exhibition of the soon\-to\-be\-reopened Museum of the University of St Andrews. This exhibit will aim to illustrate the impact of St Andrews’ graduates and the role of women through various social movements \[…\] the Franki Raffles Collection has had a significant and beneficial impact on the research and outreach activities of the Special Collections at St Andrews”* **\[C9\]** . 

 This research also led to the recognition of Raffles’ legacy and acknowledgement of her significance in the wider context of the history of women’s photography. Scott organised a public symposium entitled ‘Assessing the Legacy of Franki Raffles’ on 25 April 2017 at The Centre for Contemporary Arts \(CCA\) Glasgow, where Raffles work was discussed with leading experts and attended by 43 members of the public **\[R4\]**. Subsequently Scott and Brownrigg were invited to present a paper on Raffles at the International Conference, ‘Fast Forward Women in Photography’, National Museum of Art, Vilnius, Lithuania, 4 November 2017 **\[R5\]**. A professor from the University of Creative Arts, who attended both events stated “ *the paper given on Franki Raffles unravelled even more of this distinct and significant history \[…\] This innovative research has focused attention on the legacy and significance of Franki’s contribution to feminist photographic practice that might otherwise have been lost and opened up new ways to consider women’s photography in Scotland in the 1980’s and 1990’s.”* **\[C8\]**. 

 The benefit of the research to the Raffles family underscores the impact on the creative history of Scotland. Sandy Lunan, Raffles’ partner, states *“The impact of this for me and the family is very significant. We know now that Franki will not be forgotten and know her work can be seen and re\-assessed”* **\[C1\]**. Hugh Raffles, Franki’s brother, Professor of Anthropology at The New School, New York, USA, states *“The \[…\] Archive \[…\] doesn’t simply memorialise my sister; it makes her work available to a new generation of scholars, students, and activists,…….she challenges us to view the world as she sees it, and she proposes collaborative methodologies that remain radical today.* **\[C2\]** *”* 

 **Engaged New Audiences with Feminist Photography** 

 To date, the archive has had over 20,500 views **\[R1\]**. Users of the website have commented on the experience of engaging with Raffles’ work, and how beneficial it has been to their understanding of Scottish Feminist Photography. One individual stated “ *What a journey – amazing work”’*. Another stated *“Great work, and really important to showcase this pioneer*”. 

 Scott has also given public talks since the website launch, for example at Stills Gallery, Edinburgh in September 2016, attended by 50 people. This was followed by a seminar at the University of Stirling in October 2016, disseminating awareness of the research to scholars engaged in women’s studies. There was a further public talk at Glasgow Women’s Library in February 2017 attended by over 70 members of the public which led to an interview for the on\-line photography magazine Wildfires. Scott’s research was also covered by the popular press in a 2 page article in the Daily Record **\[C13\].** 

 Following the website launch Scott curated an exhibition of 17 Raffles’ photographs at the 1<sup>st</sup> St Andrews Photography Festival, 1 August \-11 September 2016 **\[R2\]**, celebrating *“the vitality and resilience of women in their varied personal and working roles”* \(Festival Brochure\). This was the first exhibition of Raffles’ work since her death in 1994. Two images were also selected for the main festival exhibition celebrating ‘175 years of Scottish Photography’ subsequently on tour at other venues, including An Lanntair, Stornoway \(2017\). 

 Subsequently Scott established a partnership with Jenny Brownrigg, Exhibitions Director, Glasgow School of Art. They worked on a retrospective exploring three bodies of Raffles’ work: the 1987 project ‘To let you understand *…; ‘*Soviet Women Workers’ in 1989; and ‘Zero Tolerance’ *.* This was supported by a publication to provide contextual information about Raffles creative practice, and the exhibition *‘*Observing Women Working – Franki Raffles’, Reid Gallery, Glasgow which ran 4 March – 27 April 2017, with a total of 4,351 visitors. The many comments in the Visitors’ Book included “ *Loved this exhibition, helping to fight the age old myth that women are weak”, “More important today than ever – inspiring, bold, uncompromising”,* **\[C12\]**. The publication print\-run of 330 sold out to visitors.  There was also excellent press coverage reaching a wide audience both in popular and specialist publications **\[C12\].** 

 Dr Catherine Spencer, Convenor of the Tate Contemporary Art Network, attended the Reid Gallery exhibition, and stated: *“Scott's research into the Franki Raffles archive has been absolutely crucial in enabling material that would otherwise have remained unknown, and thereby absent from histories of feminist practice in the UK during the 1970s and 1980s, to become accessible \[…\] In conjunction with the website the exhibition \[…\] has significantly helped to raise wider visibility and understanding of Raffles’ work in Scotland and beyond.* More recently Raffles’ work has been presented at the Glasgow Women’s Library On\-Line open talks ‘Ways of Seeing: Women in Photography’ in Scotland October\-November 2019, and at the 2019 Photo Oxford Festival. 

 **Brought new attention to Women’s Right’s charity **Zero Tolerance 

 The charity ‘Zero Tolerance’ is an organisation set up to raise awareness of male violence against women, created with involvement from Raffles herself. The aforementioned exhibitions were publicised by ‘Zero Tolerance’ and the organisation hosts a link to the archive on their website. Rachel Adamson, Co\-Director of the charity, confirmed that the research project had played: *“an important role in ensuring the legacy of a key feminist campaigner is remembered \[…\] By shedding light on Franki’s work on the initial Zero Tolerance campaign the archive has also had an impact in highlighting women’s inequality and the need to tackle violence against women These are key Scottish Government policy imperatives, as well as central to the work of Zero Tolerance today.”* **\[C3\]**. 

 In 2017 the Raffles archive led to a commission by *Zero Tolerance* of a new body of work by photographer Alicia Bruce, exhibited at Stills Gallery, Edinburgh **\[C14\]**. Alicia utilised the archive to create a new, modern body of feminist photography, in the style of Raffles original ‘Zero Tolerance’ work. Bruce states “ *I made this series of photographs in collaboration with women from all walks of life based in Scotland \[...\] The images I made are in the spirit of Franki Raffles photographs from the original campaign \[…\] In the Franki Raffles archive website, the most important aspects for me were the video interviews… The archive also gave me easy access to the original campaign posters”* **\[C7\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 This case study summarises the impact of our research to inform the development of the **Healthy Schools** resource; a pioneering framework to guide the teaching and planning, tracking and monitoring, and evaluation of Health and Wellbeing education in Lanarkshire, Scotland. Our research findings have led to several positive changes to the design of the Healthy Schools resource, including evidence\-informed physical activity interventions for school children and teacher training. With approximately 80% \(\~n = 95\) of primary schools within North Lanarkshire and 68% \(\~n = 88\) of primary schools within South Lanarkshire utilising the Healthy Schools resource as their core delivery model for Health and Wellbeing in the curriculum, our findings have contributed towards efforts to enhance children’s health and wellbeing. 
","
 **2. Underpinning Research** 

 Between 2012 and 2016, the Pediatric Health and Physical Activity Research Strand \(PH\) team led by Dr Buchan at UWS received funding \(GBP76,000\) from NHS Lanarkshire’s Child Healthy Weight team \(LCHW\) to utilize their scientific and research expertise to undertake a collaborative partnership. PH completed a series of linked research studies from 2012 with our findings influencing subsequent health and wellbeing provision as outlined below. 

 Buchan, Baker et al., evaluated the effectiveness of a school based “ **Fit for School**” lifestyle intervention which was implemented by the LCHW team to n=3290 children. The research **\[3.1\]** evaluated the effectiveness of the LCHW preventative services. Further work found that The **Fit for School** programme also improved several cardiometabolic risk factors and reduced waist circumference **\[3.2\].** A subsequent study examined changes in BMI and psychosocial variables following the **Fit for School** programme at six months post\-intervention **\[3.3\]** and found that some initial improvements were not evident six months after the intervention ceased. It was clear from our findings that the preventative services offered by the LCHW team may have had a short\-term impact, but once the intervention is removed, improvements were lost. Our findings highlighted the need for a sustainable approach to health and wellbeing that could be embedded within the education curriculum to assist teachers in the delivery of health and wellbeing education, and benefit children’s health and wellbeing in the long\-term. These findings were outlined in the aforementioned research and were sent to the LCHW. 

 Subsequently, Buchan and Arthur were commissioned by LCHW to evaluate a new curriculum approach to improve child health called Healthy Schools. The findings suggested that the use of Healthy Schools was helpful for teachers and positively influenced the health knowledge of children. A series of recommendations to improve the health impacts of Healthy Schools were provided **\[3.4\]** to LCHW to incorporate within future provision. 

 Specifically, there were recommended improvements to the teacher’s physical activity resources within Healthy Schools **\[3.4\].** As a result, the team delivered and evaluated teacher\-led programmes, **Daily Mile** and **Activity Breaks**. **Activity Breaks** and **Daily Mile** were delivered to five schools and 100 children, and were well\-received within the school classrooms as methods for increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour which would be appropriate to include within the Healthy Schools resource. 

 There is also a drive to influence children’s 24\-hour health behaviours throughout both school and home time, with a particular focus on health inequalities. Arthur & Buchan’s research explored the potential methods which could involve families of low socio\-economic status who were not normally involved in school activities **\[3.5\]**. Based on these findings we designed and delivered **Happy Homework** to 40 children and parents which focussed on improving 24\-hour movement behaviours and diet in a way which was accessible to all families **.** The evaluation revealed that the programme was well\-received by teachers, children and families of all backgrounds offering multiple potential health and familial benefits **.** Further evaluation of Happy Homework is anticipated in 2021. 

 The research outputs and underpinning research were the result of external funding received from NHS Lanarkshire \(GBP76,000\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Between 2012 and 2020 the Pediatric Health and Physical Activity Research Strand \(PH\) conducted several ground\-breaking interventions within schools that were shown to have a direct impact on the knowledge, behaviours, and health of over 3500 children. Our research **directly led** to the development of **three new evidenced\-informed health initiatives** and related teacher professional development \(approximately 1184 teachers\), which has subsequently improved the health and wellbeing of children within Lanarkshire, Scotland. 

 Our research provided important insights into the current NHS Lanarkshire’s Child Healthy Weight team \(LCHW\) preventative services which informed their future provision. Our research findings **\[3.1, 3.2\]** provided the first evidence to the LCHW team of the effectiveness of their preventative services within schools. These findings **\[3.1, 3.2\]** helped validate LCHW to adopt a more holistic approach to tackling the health and wellbeing of children within education settings. Moving away from short\-term, external led interventions, the Healthy Schools resource was developed **\[5.1\]**. The adoption of a more sustainable approach to the long\-term prevention of unhealthy weight gain has been influenced from the recommendations provided from of our research **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. 

 PH undertook an initial evaluation of the feasibility of implementing Healthy Schools within the school curriculum, and several recommendations were provided **\[3.4\]**. Our research findings and updates were disseminated regularly to the LCHW team via meetings every month and written reports **\[5.2\]**. Collectively, our findings and recommendations were well\-received by the LCHW team who have sought to develop and improve the Healthy Schools resource **\[5.3, 5.4\]**. This resulted in several positive changes to Healthy Schools, including changes to site navigation, the teaching of health\-related topics and initial teacher training in the use of the resource **\[5.4\]**. 

 As a result of our recommendations and the continued refinement of the Healthy Schools resource, we can demonstrate a direct and positive impact on teachers delivering health and wellbeing **\[3.4; 5.5, 5.6\]**. Our interviews with teachers found that the Healthy Schools resource provides an easy to navigate website with helpful planning, lesson activities and evaluation tools **\[3.4\]**. We have clear evidence that when teachers use the Healthy Schools resource, they note improvements in the consistency and quality of health and wellbeing lessons they deliver **\[5.5, 5.6\]**. Through our interviews with teachers, they report that Healthy Schools is a valuable tool for teachers to improve their teaching of health and wellbeing topics \- an area where teachers often lack confidence and previous training **\[5.5, 5.6\]**. 

 There has been a marked increase in the number of teachers participating in professional development related to the Healthy Schools resource from 2015/16 \(108 teachers\) to 2018/19 \(508 teachers\) **\[5.7\]**. These teachers will have benefitted from the recommendations provided to LCHW based on our research findings concerning initial teacher training **\[3.4; 5.4\]**. To date, approximately 1,292 teachers have received CPD training in the use of the Healthy Schools resource **\[5.7\]**. As our findings suggest, using the Healthy Schools resource can improve the consistency and quality of the health and wellbeing lessons teachers deliver to children **\[5.5, 5.6\]**. 

 The use of the Healthy Schools resource has grown since our initial research investigation. Approximately 80% \(\~n = 95\) of primary schools within North Lanarkshire and 68% \(\~n = 88\) of primary schools within South Lanarkshire use the resource as their core delivery model for Health and Wellbeing in the curriculum **\[5.7\]**. The collective outcomes from our research findings have helped inform the delivery of Health and Wellbeing education to approximately 38,797 children within Lanarkshire and demonstrates the wide\-reaching impact of our research findings.

which result in short-term effects. Thus, upskilling and expanding the resources available to classroom teachers could provide longer-term solutions. This paper presents a feasibility study of an online health resource (Healthy Schools Resource: HSR) developed to assist primary school teachers in the delivery of health-related education. Four schools (n = 2 intervention) participated in this study. Study feasibility was assessed by recruitment, retention and completion rates of several outcomes including height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and several metabolic markers including HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and dietary knowledge following a 10-12-week intervention period. The process evaluation involved fidelity checks of teachers\' use of the HSR and post-intervention teacher interviews. A total of 614 consent forms were issued and 267 were returned (43%), of which, 201 confirmed consent for blood sampling (75%). Retention of children participating in the study was also high (96%). Of the 13 teachers who delivered the intervention to the children, four teachers were excluded from further analyses as they did not participate in the fidelity checks. Overall, teachers found the online resource facilitative of teaching health and wellbeing and several recommendations regarding the resource were provided to inform further evaluations. Recruitment and retention rates suggest that the teacher led intervention is feasible and acceptable to both teachers, parents and children. Initial findings provide promising evidence that given a greater sample size, a longer intervention exposure period and changes made to the resource, teachers\' use of HSR could enhance measures of health and wellbeing in children."", \'original\': None}', 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Duncan S.', 'last_name': 'Buchan', 'initials': None, 'researcher_id': 'ur.01035724706.07', 'grid_ids':

Participants had height, weight, and psychosocial questionnaires assessed at pre- and post-control, pre- and post-intervention, and 6-months post-intervention. Participants completed a weekly 10-week intervention consisting of healthy eating and physical activity education, physical activity, parental involvement, and behavior change techniques. Regression models were fit with correlated errors where the correlation occurred only between time points, not between subjects, and the nesting effects of school and area deprivation were controlled. <b>Results:</b> Regression models revealed a significant decrease in body mass index from pre- to post-intervention of 0.8512 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<i>P</i> = 0.0182). No Changes in body mass index occurred from post-intervention to 6-month follow-up (<i>P</i> = 0.5446).

<p>Members of the PHC at Loughborough University engaged in strategic, high profile capacity building in parasport. This resulted in the establishment of new sports at the Paralympics and Commonwealth Games, including Paracanoe at the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics and Wheelchair Basketball at the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Their research informed the implementation of healthcare and practical advice for organisers, coaches, and athletes. For example, the International Triathlon Union changed their regulations concerning wetsuit use in 2019 to account for added strain when wearing a wetsuit in high water temperatures.

<h6>Anti-Match Fixing: Improving Global Sports Governance and Bringing Perpetrators to Account. </h6>
<p>Previously, physical evidence was required to prosecute match fixing cases. ICS research helped have this requirement removed, allowing the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to rule that evidence from betting markets was sufficient to identify match fixing. Following this ruling, FIFA ordered the replay of a match in which the referee was found to be involved in match-fixing. This was the replay that enabled Senegal to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. ICS research has also underpinned the education of athletes and coaches on match-fixing. A follow-up project, ERASMUS+, saw Liverpool partner with EU Athletes to introduce whistle-blowing apps for 3,000 athletes in 7 countries across a range of sports.

Oxford Brookes, Wolverhampton, Durham, and Southampton Solent now feature teaching on inclusive masculinities on sport-related and gender/sexuality-related courses. Anderson was one of the founders of the Sport Collision Injury Collective (SCIS), a multidisciplinary collective of academics highlighting injuries sustained in youth sport participation. The group published an open letter ‘Preventing injuries in children playing school rugby’ which petitioned to make contact sports non-compulsory. The SCIS website has received 900,000,000 hits, and the letter itself was printed in major print and online newspapers (e.g., The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Independent). New regulations regarding tackling in children’s rugby and banning heading in football for children under 12 have resulted.

<h6>Defining the autonomy and specificity of sport in EU law: Shaping the adoption of globally applicable football agent regulations and the EU’s approach to nationality-based eligibility rules in European sport.</h6>
<p>Most impact resulted from informing various EU commissions on regulating sports discrimination. Parrish’s work on nationality discrimination in sport has helped alter the EU’s approach to this issue whilst setting the boundaries for sports bodies on questions of nationality-based eligibility rules. Related commissions created change of nationality-based eligibility regulations of 26 Olympic sports across all 27 Member States of the EU, identifying that the widespread sporting practice of denying access to sporting competitions on account of nationality was in conflict with EU law regarding non-discrimination of nationality in economic matters. Judgements informed by this research protect athletes from discriminatory nationality measures adopted by both states and private bodies, such as sporting entities, under EU citizenship rights regardless of the level of economic activity (e.g., if the athlete is an amateur). Research underpinned an enquiry into nationality in European team sport launched by the European Commission in 2012, which challenged the legality of UEFA’s home-grown player rule (introduced in 2006/7). This challenge argued that the rule created indirect discrimination on the grounds of nationality.

<h6>Enhancing practice and improving outcomes of career transition support services in elite sport</h6>
<p>Introduction of mental health and practice support for professional athletes transitioning into non-sporting roles at the end of their competitive careers. This work has increased issue awareness in professional organisations and led to constructive outcomes. The England Rugby Players Association has introduced 8 development managers and 1 transition manager to support over 800 current and 400 former players across premiership clubs. These reforms became particularly significant during the Covid-19 pandemic, when team sports were heavily impacted and early career transition became necessary. This research prompted campaigns by the English Institute of Sport (#More2Me) and the International Federation of Professional Footballers Associations (FIFPro) to use the finding to encourage athletes to recognise the benefits of planning for life after sport. #More2Me was publicly backed by both the Minister for Sport and the Chair of UK Sport. Third sector organisations, such as the UK-based charity Switch the Play Foundation, have improved sport career transition outcomes based on this research.

Early work in Northern Ireland, Israel and South Africa has been extended in The Gambia, Colombia and South Korea. Related NGOs have been formed to support and further this programme and its methodologies, including the formation of UNESCO clubs based on the Brighton F4P initiatives. The model has been applied to several other sports, and since 2014 has benefitted 532 coaches/volunteers, 4,699 young people, residents and pupils in 87 local communities in 7 major cities. F4P training in Columbia in partnership with Fundación Buen Punto enabled FBP to obtain international recognition through an award given by Peace and Sport in Rhodes, 2018.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This prize\-winning exhibition of wide international reach disseminated innovative art\-historical research, based on the concept that drawings are journeys of discovery and eloquent artefacts.  It overturned art\-historical views on Raphael as a purely project\-oriented artist, and on the functional nature of Renaissance drawing.  Through an emphasis on the experimental and the persuasive aspects of drawing – foregrounding the materiality and agency of the object – the exhibition and programmes transformed visitors’ perception of the art of Raphael.  It deepened visitor appreciation of drawing, altered visitor behaviours by promoting creativity through drawing, and affected professional practice, creative practice and public understanding, nationally and internationally. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The exhibition project \(concept, visual narrative, graphic presentation, publications and public programme\) embodied the results of a 2\-year Leverhulme Trust\-funded research project, ‘Transforming our understanding of Raphael with eloquence in drawing as a research theme’, a collaboration between Catherine Whistler \(Ashmolean Museum, Oxford\) and Ben Thomas \(University of Kent\). This new research grew organically from Whistler and Thomas’s individual interests, deriving its strength from the Ashmolean’s unrivalled collection of 80 drawings by Raphael, and from the opportunity of staging an international loan exhibition in a first\-time partnership with the Albertina, Vienna \(2017\) **\(R4\).** 

 Whistler’s research since 2010 has displayed a particular concern with the cognitive and expressive nature of drawing and the historical evaluation of *disegno* \(drawing and design\) in studies of Venetian and Renaissance art.  Her 2015 exhibition in partnership with the Uffizi, Florence \( **R1**\) and her major book \( **R2**\), challenged accepted views on the significance and understanding of drawing, providing a distinctive contribution to the underpinning research for the 2017 Ashmolean exhibition.  Her 2015 exhibition additionally featured work by a leading British artist. Subsequently, Whistler invited Thomas to collaborate on a Raphael research project owing to the scholarly distinction of his work on Renaissance art theory \(the *paragone* debate and constructions of *disegno*\).  A joint academic article signalled their use of concepts of eloquence as an innovative research tool in the study of Raphael drawings \( **R3**\). The cultural enrichment through the understanding, enjoyment and practice of drawing that individuals would experience as an outcome of the exhibition was intrinsic to their thinking from the outset. A point of departure was the recognition that Raphael’s art is seen as bland and irrelevant by modern audiences.  In academic studies, concerns with taxonomy and function have marginalized Renaissance drawings: an emphasis on drawings as utilitarian steps in a linear progression towards a successful outcome has inflected current art\-historical understanding of Raphael as a pragmatic, entrepreneurial figure. Through an emphasis on the nature of drawing as a mode of thinking, discovery and performance, Whistler and Thomas aimed to transform public and academic perceptions of Raphael. 

 The research methodology involved the close visual scrutiny of Raphael drawings in UK and European collections, the technical investigation of 40 drawings by the Ashmolean Conservation Department, and knowledge\-sharing with curators and conservators internationally \(e.g. Louvre, Paris; Albertina, Vienna; Uffizi, Florence\). Angelamaria Aceto, the Research Assistant, contributed to the administration, research, public engagement and outputs of the project \( **R5, R6\).**  The team aimed to transcend disciplinary boundaries through exploring the relationship of drawing with memory, cognition, embodied knowledge, rhetoric, emotion and performance.  They held 3 interdisciplinary workshops in Oxford between 2016 and 2017 with participants \(UK and international\) from disciplines including Experimental Psychology, Social Anthropology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Classics, Medieval Studies, Italian Studies, English, History, Musicology, Fine Art, Theology and History of Art. 

 The research findings from analytical scrutiny, technical investigation, and multi\-disciplinary events enabled the project team to develop a new language for analysing Renaissance drawing and yielded original interpretations of Raphael and drawing.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 As PI, Whistler negotiated with senior figures in the relevant lending institutions \(the Louvre, the Uffizi, and others\) to demonstrate the originality and significance of the research.  This led national and international collections to agree to lend major artworks to the Ashmolean and to their first\-time partner, the Albertina, Vienna. The 120 Raphael drawings selected by the research team for display became active agents for exhibition viewers, sparking visual comparisons and juxtapositions of approach, affect and process. The innovative language used in the exhibition texts and publications was a key contributor to the impact. Another was the unusual exhibition narrative, which used the oratorical strands of invention, orchestration and expression as structuring elements over 3 galleries. The exhibition texts emphasised Raphael’s experimental approach, visual strategies and charged graphic language. This innovative presentation enabled a clear communication of the project’s findings on the material and visual rhetoric of drawings. Exhibition audiences were encouraged to engage with the drawings as intimate gestural works with the artist’s mind and hand in tune, which could activate thoughts and emotions in the viewer. 

 Research insights were disseminated in advance of and during the exhibition \(01/06/2017\-03/09/2017\) via the website, social media, YouTube films and press articles \( **E1**\). The exhibition webpage had 10,241 unique page views before the exhibition opened, and 93,797 during the run, the highest ever for the Ashmolean. The exhibition trailer was viewed 20,045 times across YouTube and Facebook, with a video featuring Whistler viewed 33,018 times across the 2 platforms \( **E2**\). A film shown first in the exhibition presented technical information and discoveries resulting from the research; it remains live on the Ashmolean website \( **E3**\). 

 **Impact on public understanding and behaviour** 

 The exhibition’s reach and significance are attested by record\-breaking visitor numbers \(67,628; target 45,000\), by the need to reprint the accompanying book 4 times \(target of 2,000 sales; over 8,500 sold\), by the overwhelmingly positive press and media response \(e.g. Jonathan Jones, *Guardian*: ‘Today, Raphael seems to many eyes … boringly strait\-laced. But that image is blown away by this exhibition. … This mind\-opening show will transform how Raphael is seen’; Richard Cork, BBC Radio 4 *Front Row*: ‘incredible … a revelation’; Jackie Wullschlager, *Financial Times*: ‘a game\-changing presentation’; Alastair Sooke, *Telegraph*: ‘first\-rate … should not be missed’\) \( **E1.4\-1.7**\), and by 2 prestigious international awards \(Apollo Exhibition of the Year; Global Fine Art awards\) \( **E4**\). 

  

 Cultural enrichment and changed public perceptions or behaviour were attested by the Exit Survey \(1,882 respondents\): 82% of exhibition visitors felt their understanding of drawing had changed, and 99.87% felt their views on Raphael had changed after visiting the exhibition \( **E5, E6**\). Particularly rewarding was the feedback from highly\-trained Visitor Experience Assistants who reported the attentiveness of visitors in looking at the drawings, with more than one person moved to tears. One visitor wrote: ‘We moved to Oxford in August 2017 when I was 5 months pregnant … When our son was born in late January 2018 we named him Raphael …The Ashmolean’s work on this exhibition had a deep impact on me and will have a life\-long effect on the small chap\!  Thank you for curating such a powerful show. I am sure it touched many people and prompted them to reflect on childhood, love, ageing and living too’ \( **E7**\). 

 Moreover, 58% of exhibition visitors were inspired to have a go at drawing. Opportunities were provided in the exhibition and shop space, e.g. encouraging people to take emotion as a subject for drawing; free Raphael sketchbooks and pencils in the main galleries took these to wider audiences. This initiative became permanent, with over 23,000 sketchbooks used by the end of 2019. 

  

 Public understanding was further altered and enriched by public engagement with research \(PER\) events involving dialogue with research findings.  Each session, with 90 places, was booked out: Stephen Farthing RA, *Raphael and the Nine Secrets of Drawing,* 7 June 2017; Catherine Whistler, *Raphael’s Eloquence,* 24 June 2017; Conversation with Ben Thomas and a Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Kent, *Drawing Attention to Raphael’s drawings,* 11 July 2017; Angelamaria Aceto and Ashmolean Senior Paper Conservator, *Beneath the surface: unveiling Raphael’s drawing techniques,* 18 July 2017. Participants were asked: 

-  Has your understanding of Raphael been changed by this talk? 

-  Has this talk made you think differently about drawing? 

 The responses were positive \(42 forms were returned with 99.5% agreeing with the first question, 100% with the second\).  Further cultural enrichment came through 4 ‘Bitesize Raphael’ public talks by early career researchers with their personal responses to the research findings. 

 **Benefits to the Ashmolean and impact on professional practice** 

 The extraordinarily positive international and national press coverage \( **E1**\) saw the Ashmolean increase its profile as a major cultural destination with 5\-star ratings from the *Financial Times*, *The Times*, *Guardian* and *Telegraph* \( **E1.4, E1.6\-1.8**\). The exhibition exit survey showed approximately 31% first\-time visitors \(up 7% from previous exhibitions\), and 14% overseas visitors \(compared to 9% at *Degas to Picasso*, the previous highly successful show\) \( **E5**\).  Economic benefits to the Ashmolean were seen in retail sales: revenue of GBP208,656, with an average spend per visitor of GBP3.09 \(compared with GBP2.31 for the previous show\); and in the highest increase per exhibition of membership of Friends of the Ashmolean \(547 new members and 350 renewals\) \( **E6**\). New types of promotion and marketing trialled during the exhibition run \(e.g. adding quotations from 5\-star reviews to the poster; advertising at Marylebone Station and London underground sites\) have become embedded in exhibition planning. Further economic benefits derive from a Raphael facsimile initiative, a new commercial partnership \(2019\) with leading Italian publisher Treccani. The award of GBP230,000 in 2018 to the Ashmolean \(Whistler as PI\) by the Getty Foundation \(international ‘Paper Project’ initiative\), for curatorial training and research on Italian drawings, was made on the basis of the Museum’s quality of drawings research. The dynamic interdisciplinary workshops enhanced the Ashmolean’s institutional research profile and affected participants’ professional practice. 

 Impact on the Ashmolean’s Learning Strategies is seen in the increased use of drawing in education and well\-being activities as a direct result of the exhibition’s success in changing perceptions of the nature and value of drawing, e.g. new Royal Drawing School/ Ashmolean courses for 15\-18 year olds; a digital initiative \(‘Your Sketchbooks’\) \( **E8**\); 2 sessions on drawings as part of a 2019 mental health initiative with Oxfordshire Mind culminating in a display of participants’ work, described by an Oxfordshire Mind representative as ‘a wonderful opportunity to present a positive image of those with mental health problems in the heart of Oxford's cultural landscape’ \( **E9**\). 

 **Benefits for artistic, museum, and curatorial practice nationally and internationally** 

 A leading British contemporary artist described how her new understanding of Raphael’s drawings has affected her creativity: ‘The Raphael exhibition … and discussions I have had with Catherine Whistler in front of Raphael’s drawings have had a profound and long lasting impact on my work. Through this possibility for intensive study of Raphael’s drawings I found new directions in my work, as well as being able to discover artistic similarities in our endeavour as artists depicting the human form’ \( **E10**\). 

 Institutional impact is attested by the Courtauld Gallery’s development of an exhibition with a publication by Ben Thomas, *Drawing Together*, based on the project team’s concept of drawing as a journey of discovery, with an associated interdisciplinary workshop at the Courtauld Research Forum \(11 November 2017\). The partner exhibition in Vienna \(28/09/2017\-07/01/2018\) \( **E11**\) evolved from our project, bringing increased revenue and profile for the Albertina, with 350,000 exhibition visits. Essays by Whistler and Thomas in the accompanying book \(German edition: 5,455 sold; English edition: 1,376 sold\) shared their research findings with a new audience. 

  

 The exhibition and book have had an enduring effect on the practice of a leading US curator: ‘The Raphael exhibition's public\-facing components had something genuinely *exciting* about them…. The show had a kind of centrifugal force, powering the viewer from drawing to drawing like a page\-turner of a novel. I assure you, this is *not* easy to accomplish. It requires deep research, enormous knowledge, and a genuine desire to understand one's diverse audiences and share one's enthusiasms. I can honestly say I have rarely, if ever, seen such a satisfying and successful exhibition of drawings. Its effect on me and my own curatorial practice was profound’ \( **E12**\). A leading US curator, now a UK museum director, also testifies to the impact of the radically innovative nature of the exhibition and book in presenting research findings: ‘The result\[s\] of these two forms of interrogation \- the intellectual bird’s\-eye question of eloquence and the parsing of each individual sheet \- were truly revelatory.  They were also controversial in a way I think is entirely healthy …This is a radical shift …\[T\]his exhibition made me think hard and for the first time about how the well\-defined processes of Renaissance speech\- or sermon\-making might appear in visual form in Raphael’s drawings – the uses of memory \(including mnemonic techniques\), invention, imitation, fantasy – with observation from life, only one ingredient’ \( **E13\).**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The UK’s automotive industry is a key strategic sector; it represents £19bn to the UK economy annually and employs 160,000 people including 38,000 in motorsport. Loughborough research on reducing frictional and dynamic mechanical losses has delivered step\-change insights into engine and powertrain behaviour for internationally recognised, sector\-leading on\- and off\-highway vehicle manufacturers and Formula One race teams. Specifically, building models from the interactions between lubricant and micro\-deformed surfaces up to whole engines and gearboxes has 1\) reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through improved fuel economy for Aston Martin and JCB, and 2\) achieved 100% gearbox reliability for Mercedes Grand Prix, the world’s leading Formula 1 race team, delivering championship\-winning performances every year since 2017. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 For two decades, the Dynamics Research Group at Loughborough has been pioneering developments in integrated multi\-physics, multi\-body dynamics and tribological modelling of engineering systems across different size scales. Since 2005, a team led by Prof Homer Rahnejat has extended this research and applied it to reducing frictional and dynamic mechanical losses in vehicle powertrains, responding to industrial demand for lightweight, downsized systems to improve fuel consumption alongside stringent emission regulations. 

 The approach pursued was predictive modelling of engineering systems by establishing the inexorable links between component dynamic deformations and tribology **\[R1\],** essentially introducing the term “tribodynamics” in the scientific literature, supported by extensive validation in the laboratory and in\-situ **\[R2\]**. The system modelling approach considers interacting physical phenomena within a common framework and across scales: large rigid body motions \(e.g. crankshaft rotation and piston primary translation\) are combined with smaller vibratory motions of components, \(e.g. piston skirt thermal and elastic distortion and compression ring deflection of 10\-100 μm\), together with lubricant film thickness \(in μm\). For example, in an engine, the crankshaft kinematics drive the piston model, which interacts with the compression ring model, which interacts with the cylinder liner model via the lubricant between them which has behaviour influenced by heat generation. This system approach is generic and can be applied equally well to many subsystems \(e.g. engine, clutch, gearbox, differential and their associated components\) and then built up to model a complete powertrain. Increased computational power and advanced numerical techniques have made this multi\-scale, multi\-physics modelling practically possible. 

 Transient numerical models were developed to study how piston compression ring dynamic deformation and its sealing function contribute to engine frictional losses, building up to studying the effect of cylinder de\-activation on friction losses at the compression ring **\[R3\]** \(combining transient lubrication, lubricant rheological state, friction due to lubricant viscous action and surface asperity interactions\). The numerical predictions were extensively validated from high performance single cylinder test engines to fully functional \(Aston Martin\) engines, ultimately modelling cylinder de\-activation for the new Aston Martin V12 engine concept. 

 Our team’s work on wheeled off\-highway vehicle powertrains required a system\-level study of lubricated surfaces in concert with component surface geometry and topography, lubricant properties and load bearing capacity. The above parameters were optimised by studying the coupled dynamics and efficiency of critical powertrain subsystems, such as wheel\-hub planetary gear sets \(multi\-objective optimisation studies involving planetary gear mesh phasing, tooth profile modification and durability\) **\[R4\]**, wet multi\-plate brake packs **\[R5\]** and wet clutch systems \(considering thermal and cavitation effects\). The links between the various subsystems \(to reach system\-level modelling\) were established by implementing boundary conditions \(loading, kinematics etc.\) obtained by experimental testing and measurements taken in complete powertrains. 

 The tribodynamics of manual transmissions and differentials have been systematically investigated for several applications \(passenger cars, high performance transmissions, off\-highway vehicles\) and gear geometries \(spur, helical, hypoid, bevel\). Research specifically on high performance vehicle transmissions predicted the dynamics and friction loss of meshing gears with teeth profile micro\-geometry modifications **\[R6\]** and explored how lubricant additives affect friction and wear when gear teeth make contact. This delivered reliability improvements under the conditions of extreme high torque and high speed encountered in F1 racing.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impacts claimed in this case study provide solutions to major practical challenges of performance and reliability for heavy duty engines and powertrains, based on two decades of fundamental research on the integration of multi\-physics, multi\-scale, multi\-body dynamic and tribological modelling at Loughborough University **\[R1, R2\]**. These impacts are the result of a series of collaboratively funded projects in which the close partnerships with three global motor industry brands were the critical pathways to impact: 

-  Aston Martin \- the iconic world\-leading British manufacturer of high\-performance prestige cars with 2500 employees, 

-  JCB – the instantly\-recognisable manufacturer of off\-road construction and agricultural vehicles with 12000 employees and factories in 5 continents, and 

-  Mercedes Grand Prix \- the top Formula 1 race team of the last decade, winning the Constructors’ World Championship for a record seventh consecutive year in 2020, including Lewis Hamilton’s 4 successive championships since 2017 

 The three companies also exemplify the different ways in which such partnerships are initiated. One is a longstanding partnership stretching back several decades with links to teaching and research \(JCB\), one was initiated by an invitation to support a major grant proposal \(Aston Martin\), based on the networking activity of the lead academic, and the third \(Mercedes Grand Prix\) was also through the networking efforts of the lead academic coupled with the growing reputation of the Loughborough team’s work in the automotive industry. The relevance of the Loughborough research and the links with industry were also inspired and enabled by the Visiting Professor appointment of Richard Parry\-Jones CBE, former Group Vice\-President at Ford Motor Company, who became Co\-Chair of the UK Automotive Council in 2009. 

 **Impact 1: Reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through improved fuel economy for leading UK vehicle manufacturers** 

 Our research on engine modelling enabled prestige passenger vehicle manufacturer Aston Martin to achieve mandated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in its new flagship V12 engine **\[R3\]**. The critical contribution was the engine modelling capability developed at Loughborough and used by Aston Martin to prove a radical engine concept **\[S1\]** for cylinder deactivation. 

 The V12 engine is the power unit for the Aston Martin DB11, described as “ *the most important Aston in the company’s 103\-year history*” \(CEO Andy Palmer in a 2016 Autocar review\), with almost 4000 European sales since launch. 

 CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the DB11 had to be reduced to 265g/km, compared to 325g/km for its predecessor \(DB9\), to meet the company’s glidepath for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction as agreed with the EU Commission \(and subsequently with California Air Resource Board and the US Environmental Protection Agency\). Aston Martin had to meet this challenge and our research made that possible. Failure to achieve the target would have resulted in fines and significant reputational damage. The Chief Engineer at Aston Martin \[2001\-17\] reported that: 

 *“Aston Martin were developing a new V12 turbocharged engine with very challenging fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions targets. The key to achieving the targets was cylinder deactivation WITHOUT complicated valve mechanisms and their associated losses and durability challenges, enabling 6 cylinder running in normal driving conditions. <ins>The Loughborough modelling was the only way to confirm the viability of the Aston Martin concept</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins></ins><ins>It triggered a multi\-</ins><ins>million pound</ins> <ins>development investment</ins> but we also estimated a saving of £4M on the development programme we would otherwise have needed. The system was a great success, with an <ins>additional benefit in reduced parts cost on every engine</ins><ins>.</ins> The DB11 went into production with the new V12 engine with <ins>unprecedented real world fuel economy figures of up to 30mpg and emissions below 265g/km</ins>, as required, resulting in almost 4000 European sales since launch. Based on cylinder deactivation being worth up to 5 grammes of CO<sub>2</sub>/km and EU sales of 1000 cars per annum, a fine of almost €0.5M per annum could have been incurred, as well as big reputational damage”.* **\[S2\]** 

 Further, our validated powertrain modelling research **\[R4, R5\]** with off\-road heavy\-duty vehicle manufacturer JCB was incorporated into the design of the new JCB ‘Eco\-Axle Driveline’, which significantly reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through improved fuel economy on the JCB ‘Backhoe Loader’, ‘Wheeled Loader’ and ‘Loadall’ vehicles. The JCB ‘Backhoe Loader’ is the iconic vehicle of the JCB fleet; JCB’s website states that nearly half of all backhoe loaders sold round the world are JCBs. The ‘Wheeled Loader’ has a high load handling capability based entirely on the front shovel while the ‘Loadall’ vehicle features a telescopic arm that is used to handle loads with a reach of up to 20m. After the ‘Backhoe Loader’, the ‘Loadall’ is one of JCB’s highest volume products. Together, these three vehicle families account for almost 80% of JCB vehicle sales. 

 JCB’s internal data analysis **\[S3\]** indicates that, under road duty, the ‘Backhoe Loader’ achieved 1.21 litres per hour fuel saving and <ins>7.9% CO</ins><ins>2</ins> <ins>emissions reduction</ins> across all uses, while the ‘Loadall’ showed a fuel saving of 3.29 litres per hour and <ins>CO</ins><ins>2</ins> <ins>emissions reduction of 13%</ins> across all uses. The Product Innovation Director of JCB confirmed this data and stated 

 “*the technologies which were first developed in the JCB Transmissions / LU collaborative Eco Drive Line \[ECO\-DL\] project of 2016/2017 are now being introduced into the drivelines of many Stage V emission JCB mid\-range machines \- including Backhoe Loaders, Loadalls, and Wheel Loaders … from January 2020, technical initiatives realised from the project have been integrated into all our axles for the agricultural market, with an approximate production volume of 700 per year.”  \[S4\]** 

 Commenting on an imminent launch for which ECO\-DL project findings have been built into the development programme since 2017, he added: 

 *“In Ql 2021, JCB will launch a new gearbox family for the construction industry which incorporates further ECO\-DL initiatives taking the production volume to approximately 4,200 per year”.* **\[S4\]** 

 **Impact 2: Achieved 100% gearbox reliability for world’s leading Formula 1 race team, delivering championship\-winning performances** 

 The Loughborough team’s research on tribo\-dynamic numerical modelling of gear pairs **\[R6\]** has been one of the biggest influences on the Mercedes Grand Prix \(MGP\) gearbox design, leading to successive improvements in reliability that have been critical to winning the Formula 1 Constructors’ and Drivers’ Championships every year since 2017. The critical contribution was the incorporation of Loughborough’s numerical codes for transmission modelling into the MGP simulation tools. These provided essential knowledge of the dynamic loading on gear teeth during power transmission, leading to clarity about gearbox failure modes and operation limits. 

 Gearbox reliability is of primary importance in Formula 1 racing. Repairs mean lost track time and current race rules impose grid penalties if a replacement gearbox is used. Catastrophic raceday failures prevent race completion which means lost championship points. 

 As well as enhancing reliability, our research has led to additional gains through reduction in oil volume, which decreases gearbox mass and oil churning losses, and ultimately contributes to better performance of the car overall. This is significant in a context where gearbox reliability improvements generally come with increased weight. 

 The Chief Engineer of Mercedes Grand Prix reported that: 

 *“Not only has the Loughborough research been a key aspect for Mercedes Grand Prix \(MGP\) to understand how to design the gearbox to prevent failures, it has also proved surprisingly useful for improving laptime through reduction of churning losses”.* **\[S5\]** 

 The Loughborough codes have influenced the gearbox design in each of the last 4 seasons, specifically optimising gear tooth geometry, gear ratios, and gearbox shaft properties and enhancing understanding of temperature and lubrication on gear performance. 

 The Mercedes Grand Prix Chief Engineer further stated that: 

 “*All teams are understandably coy about the design details of their cars, but it is a matter of record that every year there are 5\-10 gearbox penalties in the Championship \(each incurring a 5\-place grid penalty\). Furthermore, any failure on track requires exhaustive technical review and a significant absorption of resources. For two whole seasons now, MGP have not suffered a single gearbox failure either in practice or during the race. This has been a significant factor in our success*” **\[S5\]**. 

 Since 2019, the gearboxes have also been used by the BWT Racing Point F1 team, who have not suffered failures either. The Chief Engineer concluded by saying: 

 “*Our research collaboration with Loughborough has improved our understanding of gearbox design and contributed to a significant shift in gearbox reliability. As a result, we have obtained a competitive advantage compared to the other F1 Teams, providing <ins>a contributing factor to winning the Constructor's Championship every year since 2017*</ins>” **\[S5\]**.

Reduction of power loss, directly leading to the development of new generation ECO-axles requires analysis of gear contacting conditions for lubricated conjunctions to determine frictional performance. This is also affected by gear dynamics, which is a prerequisite for assessment of noise, vibration and harshness performance. Therefore, a combined tribo-dynamic analysis is essential. There is a dearth of such holistic analysis, particularly for the case of wheel hub planetary systems. The paper presents such an analysis, which has not hitherto been reported in literature. The inexorable interplay of transmission efficiency and noise, vibration and harshness refinement is demonstrated. The key attributes of noise, vibration and harshness refinement and transmission efficiency can pose contrary requirements and near-optimal conditions can be highlighted by mesh phasing of gearing contacts, thus alleviating the need for more complex gear teeth modifications entailing prohibitive manufacturing costs.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Ehsan', 'last_name':

in off-highway vehicular powertrain development are fuel efficiency and environmental protection. As a result, palliative measures are made to reduce parasitic frictional losses while sustaining machine operational performance and reliability. A potential key contributor to the overall power loss is the rotation of disengaged wet multi-plate pack brake friction. Despite the numerous advantages of wet brake pack design, during high-speed manoeuvre in highway travel or at start-up conditions, significant frictional power losses occur. The addition of recessed grooves on the brake friction lining is used to dissipate heat during engagement. These complicate the prediction of performance of the system, particularly when disengaged. To characterise the losses produced by these components, a combined numerical and experimental approach is required. This paper presents a Reynolds-based numerical model including the effect of fluid inertia and squeeze film transience for prediction of performance of wet brake systems. Model predictions are compared with very detailed combined Navier–Stokes and Rayleigh-Plesset fluid dynamics analysis to ascertain its degree of conformity to representative physical operating conditions, as well the use of a developed experimental rig. The combined numerical and experimental approach is used to predict significant losses produced during various operating conditions. It is shown that cavitation becomes significant at low temperatures due to micro-hydrodynamic action, enhanced by high fluid viscosity. The magnitude of the losses for these components under various operating conditions is presented. The combined numerical-experimental study of wet multi-plate brakes of off-highway vehicles with cavitation flow dynamics has not hitherto been reported in the literature.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'M', 'last_name': 'Leighton', 'initials': None, 'researcher_id': 'ur.012134104007.15', 'grid_ids': array(['grid.6571.5'], dtype=object), 'orcid': array(['0000-0002-9488-4999'], dtype=object), 'corresponding': False, 'raw_affiliations': array(['Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK'],\n       dtype=object), 'affiliations_address': array([{'grid_id': 'grid.6571.5', 'city_id': 2643567, 'state_code': None, 'country_code': 'GB', 'raw_affiliation': 'Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK'}],\n       dtype=object)}\n {'first_name': 'Nicholas', 'last_name': 'Morris', 'initials': None, 'researcher_id': 'ur.015034204551.29', 'grid_ids': array(['grid.6571.5'], dtype=object), 'orcid': array(['0000-0001-9463-647X'], dtype=object), 'corresponding': True, 'raw_affiliations': array(['Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK'],\n       dtype=object), 'affiliations_address': array([{'grid_id': 'grid.6571.5', 'city_id': 2643567, 'state_code': None, 'country_code': 'GB', 'raw_affiliation': 'Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK'}],\n       dtype=object)}\n {'first_name': 'Gareth', 'last_name': 'Trimmer', 'initials': None, 'researcher_id': 'ur.012363115544.21', 'grid_ids': array(['grid.480037.8'], dtype=object), 'orcid': array([], dtype=object), 'corresponding': False, 'raw_affiliations': array(['J.C.

presents transient thermal-mixed-hydrodynamics of piston compression ring–cylinder liner conjunction for a 4-cylinder 4-stroke gasoline engine during a part of the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC). Analyses are carried out with and without cylinder de-activation technology in order to investigate its effect upon the generated tribological conditions. In particular, the effect of cylinder deactivation upon frictional power loss is studied. The predictions show that overall power losses in the piston–ring cylinder system worsen by as much as 10% because of the increased combustion pressures and liner temperatures in the active cylinders of an engine operating under cylinder deactivation. This finding shows the down-side of this progressively employed technology, which otherwise is effective in terms of combustion efficiency with additional benefits for operation of catalytic converters.

The preferential compliance is achieved through structural stiffening, such that a greater entrainment wedge is achieved at the skirt’s bottom edge through thermo-elastic deformation, whilst better conforming contact geometry at the top of the skirt. In practice, the combination of some of these conditions is intended to improve the load-carrying capacity and reduce friction. The approach is fundamental to the underlying ethos of race and high-performance engine technology. Contact loads of the order of 5 kN and contact kinematics in the range 0–35\\xa0m/s result in harsh transient tribological conditions. Therefore, piston design requires detailed transient analysis, which integrates piston dynamics, thermo-elastic distortion and transient elastohydrodynamics. The paper provides such a detailed analysis as well as verification of the same using non-invasive ultrasonic-assisted lubricant film thickness measurement from a fired engine under normal operating conditions, an approach not hitherto reported in literature.

large variations in torque and power. Pitch line velocities of up to 52 m/s and teeth pair contact pressures of up to 3 GPa are routinely encountered under race conditions. Contact patch asymmetry due to angular misalignments between input and output shafts leads to the generation of high edge stress discontinuities on gear flanks, inducing fatigue spalling which affects system durability. Crowning is widely used as a palliative measure to mitigate these undesired effects. These problems can be further exacerbated by contact footprint truncation. The paper presents a new approach to modelling the kinematics and contact micro-geometry of meshing conjunctions of involute spur gears with profile and lead modifications. A time-efficient analytical method is presented to accurately determine the contact footprint and kinematics, leading to the solution of highly loaded non-Newtonian mixed thermo-elastohydrodynamic contact under the extreme prevalent conditions of high performance vehicular transmissions.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Dey’s and Dr Al\-Karaghouli’s research on digital consumer culture, customers’ satisfaction and service quality, has influenced the strategic decision\-making and marketing communications environment at Three UK. The telecommunications and internet service provider which is ranked in the Top 4 of market share holders among mobile operators, had commissioned Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli to prepare a technical report on the impact of speed on consumers’ switching intentions in the UK mobile telephone industry in September 2016. Three UK subsequently used the research to reinforce their own assessment of speed and to revamp their advertising campaigns which had a direct influence on the creation of their 2018 and 2019 television commercials for mobile phones.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Dey \(then, Senior Lecturer\) and Dr Al\-Karaghouli of Brunel Business School have conducted extensive research on digital consumer culture, customers’ satisfaction and service quality. \(Ref. 2; Ref. 3; Ref. 4\). Dr Dey’s work conceptualised and theorised digital consumer culture \(Ref.5\) and explored and analysed consumers’ interaction with and appropriation of digital technology \(Ref.6\) 

 Their most recent research project concentrated on the role speed plays for UK mobile telephone customers \(Ref. 1\). 

 Mobile telecom is a highly competitive industry where each operator’s products are seen as only partial substitutes for other providers’ products. Mobile operators try to retain and grow their customer base through differentiated products and services that have multiple attributes. As a result, a wide range of factors may influence customers’ assessment of mobile telecom services and in turn influence their decision to remain or switch. It is important for operators and policy makers to know which factors influence a customer’s decision to remain with and switch from their existing provider as the cumulative effect of this type of decision will have a major impact on competitive dynamics. 

 In addition to basic product features such as quality of voice calls and text messaging services, customers are likely to value other features such as data network coverage and speed of Internet access. However, it is not clear from the existing literature whether internet speed on mobile telephones has any influence on customers’ service satisfaction and subsequent switching decision. This lack of clarity inhibited mobile telephone service providers’ marketing strategies and endeavour to offer and promote appropriate service features. Even if they attempted to highlight speed as a decisive factor, due to a lack of academic research regulatory bodies such as Ofcom, did not properly recognise their claims. This was the case when Ofcom blocked Hutchison’s \(widely known as Three Mobile\) campaign geared towards investigating whether in the changing market environment consumers take notice of speed which in turn affects their perception of the brand and value of the network provider. 

 After Ofcom’s evaluation, Three UK commissioned Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli in September 2016 to produce independent academic research to test the impact of speed on consumers’ switching decisions in the UK mobile telephone industry. Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli took a marketing perspective and developed a conceptual framework from critically analysing the extensive review of the relevant academic literature that selected on consumer behaviour, branding and electronics engineering \(Ref. 1\). 

 The research findings showed that customers rate speed as the second most significant component of service quality after call quality, when choosing a mobile telecom provider. Their data also confirmed that brand image is positively associated with speed and a significant driver in the creation and maintenance of a company’s perceived value among mobile telephone customers.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Meeting the high competitions and the rapid consumers’ demand for the wide use of smartphones and increasing subscription to high speed data networks, there is a predictive trajectory of customers’ growing reliance on Internet\-mediated services and facilities. A 2016 Ofcom report on ‘Coping in the connected world’ suggests that 9 in 10 adults in the UK go online every day and indicates that smartphones and tablets offer the most convenient means for being connected with the Internet world. A 2020 ‘UK Mobile Phones Market Report’ from Mintel, one of the largest market intelligence agencies globally, estimates that the UK smartphone market was worth GBP6,520,000,000 in 2019. Providers within the UK mobile telephone industry therefore continually determine how consumers choose providers \(e.g. based on speed and coverage\) in order to keep up in a competitive market and growing userbase. The measures are required to stay ahead of competitors, acquire new customers and retain existing customer base by achieving customer satisfaction through high quality products and services. 

 Three UK carries 36% of the UK’s mobile data traffic and is the fastest growing network in the country which covers more than 97% of the population. With approximately 10,100,000 active customers who use over 3.5 times more mobile data than the industry average, they are one of the most popular mobile telephone providers in the UK. 

 Dr Dey’s and Dr Al\-Karaghouli’s research outputs in the form of the project report and published article were submitted to Ofcom to reconsider their initial decision of blocking Three’s campaign. Although the outputs did not make significant changes in Ofcom’s position, the documents were widely used by the Three management. 

 Dr Dey’s and Dr Al\-Karaghouli’s research findings informed the ways in which Three engages with regulators. The Senior Strategy Manager of Three confirms, that the report “validated our initial assumptions that in the changing market environment consumers pay increasing attention to speed which in turn contributes to their perceptions of the brand and value of a network provider” \(E1\). 

 Three subsequently used the document as a point of reference for their current and future strategies, which increasingly recognise the importance of speed. While remaining compliant to Ofcom, the report produced by Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli has improved the quality of discussion at Three. Prior to the report, Three was unsure whether their own assessment, which showed that it is worthwhile putting speed to the forefront, was accurate. However, the research “reinforces and concurs with our own assessment of speed,” says the Senior Strategy Manager, and it has convinced them to stick to their existing operational strategy \(E1\). Importantly, it also influenced their decision to make speed a core part of their strategic decision\-making and marketing communications. 

 Three used the research findings to enhance their brand image and customers’ perceived value, and discourage them from switching to a competitor. For example, they have made both call quality and speed key aspects of their marketing communications in order to grow their position in the UK mobile telecom industry. 

 Three’s recent advertising campaigns highlight the importance of customers’ perceived value underpinned by the call quality, brand image and network speed. Their 2018 TV ad ‘Phone History \#PhonesAreGood’ “for instance has strong indication that speed has significant impact on consumption experience” \(E1\). It also comically depicts how major historical events could have been alleviated if only the people at the time had had a good smartphone with excellent speed by their side \(such as the Captain of the Titanic successfully circumnavigating the iceberg and Henry VIII averting any unfortunate marriages with the means of a dating app\). Likewise, the 2019 TV ad ‘The Switch | Switch to Three’ advertises the high influence of call quality on consumers when depicting a customer at sea with perfect reception on her mobile phone. 

 Dr Dey’s and Dr Al\-Karaghouli’s research have informed the strategic decision\-making process and marketing communications at Three UK, a company that ranks in the top 4 mobile operators that hold the biggest market share in the country. Three UK confirms that they “plan to make further progress with our partnership with Dr Dey, Dr Al\-Karaghouli and Brunel University London to explore and apply further implications of the research” \(E1\).

In doing so, this paper conducts a systematic review of extant literature from 2002 to 2017 to identify and analyse the underlying factors that influence customers’ willingness to leave digital footprints on social media. The findings of this review reveal that personal behaviour (intrinsic psychological dispositions), technological factors (relative advantage and convenience), social influence (social interaction, social ties and social support) and privacy and security (risk, control and trust) are the key factors that influence customers’ willingness to generate and leave big data digital footprints on social media.

This paper provides a critical and systematic review of the current literature on citizens’ trust in e-government, with a particular focus on the most critical factors influencing citizens’ trust in respect of the adoption of e-government. The extant literature was identified through six electronic databases, from 2000 to 2014. Academic articles were reviewed if they contained a relevant discussion of the antecedents or factors influencing citizens’ trust in e-government adoption. The findings of this review reveal that several studies have been conducted in the area of trust in e-government (particularly trust in government and trust in the internet) with limited consideration paid to citizen’s aspects of trust (such as personality, culture, gender, experience, education level, beliefs and value of systems). Based on the findings of the critical review, a conceptual framework is proposed by developing further the updated DeLone and McLean IS Success Model, which presents the antecedents of trust in

<p>The research contributed to a re-evaluation of The New Humanitarian (TNH), a key media news source for policymakers and the humanitarian aid sector. These changes led humanitarian agencies to pay attention to ‘forgotten crises’, leading to action that would otherwise not have been offered. Most notable is the TNH’s reporting on the ‘overlooked’ March 2018 Yazidi healthcare crisis in Iraq. This reporting resulted in immediate action from the UN migration agency and Doctors Without Borders, among others. By the end of 2018, the main hospital serving the Yazidi minority had been moved to a safer and better-equipped facility and acquired new ambulances. TNH doubled their citation of ‘local experts’ in coverage between 2015-2017 and increased the proportion of ‘investigative’ or ‘campaigning’ journalism in their outputs. This helped humanitarian professionals develop policies that address the most urgent challenges in remote crises. For example, a 2018 TNH investigation into alleged chronic corruption in the UN’s resettlement process in Sudan caused the UN’s refugee agency to suspend resettlement operations there subject to further review. TNH’s reformed reporting has impacted the aid sector at an institutional level. For example, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and others have used TNH as a source when lobbying the UN Human Rights Council for an inquiry into abuse against the Rohingya.

<h6>Visual Media Literacy for Combating Misinformation</h6>
<p>The Visual Social Media Lab (VSML) carried out a number of impact activities, culminating in the ‘Questioning Images’ (QI) resource. QI has underpinned election-related media literacy campaigns in Canada and Colombia in 2019. These activities reached ~9,000 teachers and 1.2 million pupils in Canada (70% of all schools in Canada), and 199 school and 76,000 pupils in Colombia. The VSML also responded rapidly to COVID-19 misinformation, producing a teacher’s guide which trained 80 schools in Manchester, reaching 1,600 pupils.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> is an award\-winning Geographic Information System \(GIS\)\-based domestic energy mapping software. It can rapidly and accurately identify appropriate dwellings for area\-based energy retrofits at a neighbourhood or city scale. It does this by combining a spatial\-mapping\-based, data\-driven approach with innovative data\-reduction techniques. DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> creates energy models and assesses the potential for energy retrofit measures on a house\-by\-house basis, which is then scaled up to cover a much larger urban area. 

 The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model has provided a range of environmental, public policy and practice benefits to low\-carbon community organisations, local authorities, architects and householders. These local, national and international benefits have been achieved through: 

-  influencing the United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\)’s refined Global Common Carbon Metric \(CCM\) approach 

-  enabling the development of British Standards Institution \(BSI\) standards 

-  facilitating a range of powerful public engagement initiatives 

-  making real energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions \(over 50%\) through energy retrofit measures in existing housing. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Rajat Gupta, Director of both the Low Carbon Building Research Group and Oxford Institute for Sustainable Development at Oxford Brookes University, combined energy modelling and spatial mapping to create the RIBA\-award\-winning \(2006\) Domestic Energy, Carbon Counting and Carbon Reduction Model \(DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>\). DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> is unique in bringing together GIS techniques \(based on MapInfo GIS\) and the Building Research Establishment’s Domestic Energy Model \(BREDEM\-12\). It can rapidly measure, model, map, manage and track domestic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions house by house, and also collect and visualise results on an urban scale, to help local authorities plan area\-based energy retrofits. 

 The background calculations of DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> are performed by BREDEM\-12 and Standard Assessment Procedure \(SAP 2009\), which are dynamically linked. To inform the model, actual home characteristics are gathered from historic and current maps, on\-site street surveys, occupant questionnaires and literature describing home characteristics based on age and typology. DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> uses data reduction techniques to assess baseline energy use and evaluate energy savings. It can also assess CO<sub>2</sub> reductions and the cost\-effectiveness \(using life\-cycle costing\) of applying best\-practice energy efficiency strategies and low/zero\-carbon technologies in existing housing for current **\(R1\)** and future climate **\(R2\)**. 

 As part of the **ESRC/EPSRC**  [EVALOC low carbon communities](http://www.evaloc.org.uk/) project \(PI: Gupta, Researcher: Gregg, 2011–2015, GBP1,144,509, ES/I006664/1\) led by Professor Gupta in collaboration with Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute, the researchers worked in partnership with six communities who took part in the Department of Environment and Climate Change \(DECC\)’s \(now DBEIS\) GBP10,000,000 Low Carbon Communities Challenge \(LCCC\) programme. EVALOC assessed and explained changes in energy use in the participating communities as a result of their LCCC activities, looking at individual dwellings and the wider community. To help community groups reduce energy use, DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> was used to measure, visualise and communicate energy use for over 1,800 dwellings, both before and after community energy projects. It was also used to predict future carbon savings across the six communities **\(R3\)**. The carbon maps created by the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model gave the local community energy group, local authority and householders visual feedback about energy use. It also provided evidence of community action, and presenting carbon maps at workshops showed that others were also engaged in energy action **\(R4\)**. The EVALOC project also created an EVALOC eNergy And Communities Toolkit \(ENACT\) to enable better public access to briefings, case studies and technical reports arising from the project, including the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> approach and results. 

 Later, in the **Innovate UK**\-funded  [LEMUR](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=132027) \(Local Energy Mapping for Urban Retrofit\) project \(PI: Gupta, Researcher: Gregg, 2015–2016, GBP161,531, project ref: 132027\), the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model was further enhanced. It was adapted to use publicly available national and local datasets on housing and energy to quickly identify suitable city neighbourhoods for particular retrofit measures, based on relative energy use and fuel poverty ratings **\(R5\)**. The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model was then used to estimate energy use and potential for energy reduction on a house\-by\-house basis. This approach was successfully tested in the town of Bicester, Oxfordshire. 

 Building on the LEMUR project, the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model was applied as part of the **EU ERDF**\-funded  [OxFutures](http://oxfutures.org/projects/) project \(Co\-I: Gupta, 2017–2020, the total value GBP1,599,810\) to identify fuel\-poor neighbourhoods with high energy use, covering over 2,000 dwellings in five district councils of Oxfordshire **\(R6\)**. The findings were used by community organisations such as Low Carbon Hub to increase take\-up of home energy improvements. Findings from the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>–LEMUR project have been used to develop a county\-wide future energy planning tool in collaboration with Oxfordshire County Council as part of the **Innovate UK** Local Energy Oxfordshire \(LEO\) project \(Co\-I: Gupta, 2019–2022, the total value GBP13,788,087, project ref: 104781\). 

 DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> research is being adapted for use in India, to build community energy models of 2,000 homes across five cities. It will be used to evaluate the potential for deployment of energy\-saving measures and rooftop solar, as part of the **EPSRC/Indian Department of Science and Technology \(DST\)**\-funded  [RESIDE](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/about-brookes/news/researchers-receive-major-grant-to-help-improve-the-energy-efficiency-of-millions-of-homes-in-india/) project \(PI: Gupta 2017–2022, GBP1,300,000 million: GBP772,178 from EPSRC and the remainder from DST, EP/R008434/1\) on residential building energy demand reduction in India.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model, EVALOC and subsequent research projects have had a considerable and sustained impact on environmental policy. They have also improved community and public engagement. Both of these things have improved housing energy performance. The following examples demonstrate these benefits. 

 **Informing policies and practice** 

 Principles of the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> research have underpinned the development of tools, protocols and practices. Through his role as technical advisor, Professor Gupta piloted and refined UNEP’s Global Common Carbon Metric \(CCM\) approach through the Sustainable Buildings and Climate Initiative. The CCM protocol has been developed as an ISO standard on carbon metrics of buildings \(ISO/TC 59/SC17\) **\(S1\)**. As a member of the steering committee, Professor Gupta applied DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>’s principles of accounting carbon emissions from all energy end uses in dwellings in the BSI’s ‘UK PAS 2060 Specification of the demonstration of carbon neutrality’ **\(S2\)**, and this was taken up by nearly 100 organisations. 

 The EVALOC project was profiled as an exemplar case study in the DECC’s National Community Energy Strategy \(2014\), and DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> was highlighted as a carbon mapping tool that is key to helping community groups reduce energy use by measuring, visualising and communicating house\-by\-house energy use and the potential for carbon savings **\(S3\)**. 

 Findings from DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>’s research within the EVALOC and LEMUR projects have been presented regularly \(2014, 2015 and 2016\) to senior members of the Energy Efficiency Deployment Unit \(EEDO\) in DECC, and used to inform policy development in the field of community/local energy and household energy use. In September 2015, Professor Gupta was invited by Scottish Government officials working in the community energy sector to share the evaluation approach adopted in the EVALOC project. The action research approach influenced the Scottish Government’s evaluation protocols for measuring the impact of community energy initiatives. 

 The Construction Leadership Council’s Green Construction Board’s report **\(S4\)** explicitly highlighted the EVALOC tools and datasets \(created by the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model on monitoring and evaluation of household energy use\) and awarded them the highest score \(four out of four\) for future usefulness in understanding housing energy use. 

 **Improving community engagement** 

 The findings from the EVALOC–DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> research have been used by community organisations and community energy projects. Community\-based organisations involved in the Eco\-Easterside project used evidence from EVALOC to support a successful funding bid worth £1 million. The participants who were provided with energy feedback in the six carbon mapping workshops were more motivated to adopt energy\-saving behaviours and to undertake further retrofit measures \(from draught\-proofing and re\-dressing the mortar joints in external walls, to fitting solar PV panels\). EVALOC fed directly into a collaborative Knowledge Exchange project \(Monitoring and Evaluation for Sustainable Communities\), which trialled a variety of EVALOC’s monitoring and evaluation tools to enable rapid learning among members of Transition Network and Low Carbon Communities Network **\(S5\)**. 

 The community engagement and household recruitment methodology developed in the EVALOC project were applied in an Innovate UK\-funded project, Energy Resources for Integrated Communities \(ERIC\), to encourage householders to store and share solar\-generated electricity. The ERIC project installed solar photovoltaic \(PV\) systems and smart batteries in 82 dwellings in a neighbourhood in Oxford, resulting in generation of 117 MWh per year \(over 25 years\) of solar electricity and increased self\-consumption of PV electricity from 51% on average to 65% per year. The project also won two prestigious national energy awards in 2016 **\(S6\)**. 

 **Extending public engagement** 

 Many public engagement activities, including workshops, advice stalls and open exhibitions, were undertaken throughout the EVALOC project. For a national interactive exhibition, ‘A Sense of Energy’, the EVALOC installation used thermal imaging and DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> carbon mapping to ‘visualise’ energy **\(S7\)**. Airbrushing the colours normally seen in a thermal image on to a doll’s house was an innovative way of demonstrating heat losses from a typical Victorian terrace, as well as providing recommendations on how to reduce them. DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> carbon mapping showed the changes in a community’s estimated domestic household energy use, before and after local community energy action. The public exhibitions ran in London in July 2014 and in Cardiff from September to October 2014. In Cardiff, the exhibition included workshops and gave visitors the chance to talk to researchers. The EVALOC thermally imaged doll’s house installation has been used in local public events in Oxford, including the 2015 OUTBURST festival, where it attracted attention as part of the welcome exhibit aimed at designers, managers and developers in the construction industry. 

 The ENACT toolkit on the EVALOC website was devised to promote public access to the findings in easy\-to\-understand briefings, case studies and technical reports **\(S8\)**. The EVALOC website was viewed 5,231 times, with 612 returning visitors between March 2015 and March 2016. This is in comparison to only 2,645 total views prior to the ENACT toolkit being launched \(April 2012 to February 2015\). The visitors to the site are believed to be a mix of community practitioners and building industry personnel who are interested in monitoring and evaluating the impacts of community energy initiatives and energy retrofits. 

 **Achieving real CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions** 

 The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> approach has been applied in advanced low\-carbon refurbishments of three Innovate UK\-funded ‘Retrofit for the future’ projects by Oxford Brookes University. Of these, one project \(Oxford Whole House Carbon Reduction\) achieved 80% carbon emission, with wide media coverage, and was the only case study profiled by Innovate UK \(formerly TSB\) in its ‘Retrofit analysis’ report **\(S9\)**. Through the DECC\-funded Local Energy Assessment Fund \(2012\), DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> enabled a local community in Bicester to prepare for the National Green Deal programme. During the assessment period, it allowed the community to assess the potential for applying costed refurbishment packages, based on a combination of best\-practice energy\-saving measures and low\-carbon technologies. Findings from the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>–Bicester model were used directly to install cavity and wall insulation in 42 dwellings, resulting in CO<sub>2</sub> savings of least 50tCO<sub>2</sub> per year **\(S10**\). 

 Since 2018, DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>–India models in the RESIDE project have been developed to target the deployment of energy demand reduction measures \(insulation, shading, low\-energy cooling/heating systems\) combined with rooftop solar, across five Indian cities. Findings are being used to inform the assessment of the residential energy code that will impact the energy performance of 100 million homes in the next 10 years.

The development and application of a bottom-up carbon-counting approach called DECoRuM is described. DECoRuM is a Geographical Information System-based software model which estimates and maps baseline energy use and CO2 emissions on a house-by-house level, identifies ‘pollution’ hotspots, predicts the potential for reductions in CO2 emissions and monitors reductions achieved as a result of deploying energy efficiency measures and renewable energy systems. The application of DECoRuM model to a case study in Oxford shows that CO2 emission reductions above 60% are possible, at a cost of between £6 and £77 per tonne of CO2 emissions saved, depending upon the package of measures used and the scenario of capital costs (low or high) employed. Alongside DECoRuM, the author has led the development of an action-oriented Oxford Climate Change Action Plan (OCCAP) which uses top-down approaches to construct an accurate CO2 emissions inventory for Oxford city for a baseline year, establish CO2 reduction targets and propose action for each of the energy-related sectors to meet those targets.

50 years and beyond, the risk of overheating in homes is a concern. This is specifically relevant in the UK\'s suburbs where 84% of the population reside. To assess this future impact and the effectiveness of adaptive retrofitting, probabilistic climate change data for the 2030s and 2050s are used to assess the overheating risk in six suburban house archetypes in three cities in the UK: Bristol, Oxford and Stockport. The risks of overheating in typical constructions are assessed and the possibility of preventing overheating through the use of adaptation packages is evaluated through dynamic thermal simulation. Homes in Oxford show the greatest risk of overheating. The most effective (passive) package for tackling future overheating tends to combine fabric improvements and internal heat gain reduction. To assist planners and policy-makers in assessing and preventing overheating risk at a stock level, this adaptation package is further evaluated in selected neighbourhoods across the three case study cities, using the geographical information system (GIS)-based DECoRuM-Adapt (Domestic Energy, Carbon Counting and Carbon Reduction Model) model. The implications for public policy are that the existing housing stock must be future-proofed for a warming climate, particularly retrofit programmes (e.g. the Green Deal) and any upgrading of building regulations. Etant donné que les répercussions du changement climatique vont devenir de plus en plus importantes au cours des cinquante prochaines années et au-delà, le risque de surchauffe dans les habitations constitue un sujet de préoccupation. Ceci revêt une pertinence particulière dans les banlieues du Royaume-Uni dans lesquelles réside 84 % de la population. Afin d\'évaluer cet impact futur et l\'efficacité du réaménagement adaptatif, les données probabilistes relatives au changement climatique pour les années 2030 et 2050 sont utilisées pour évaluer le risque de surchauffe dans six archétypes de maisons suburbaines situés dans trois villes du Royaume-Uni : Bristol, Oxford et Stockport. Les risques de surchauffe dans des constructions types sont évalués et la possibilité de prévenir l\'excès de chaleur par le recours à des trains de mesures d\'adaptation est évaluée au moyen d\'une simulation thermique dynamique. Les habitations situées à Oxford présentent le plus grand risque de surchauffe. Les mesures (passives) les plus efficaces pour s\'attaquer aux futurs excès de chaleur tendent à combiner les améliorations apportées à l\'enveloppe des bâtiments et une réduction interne du gain de chaleur. Afin d\'aider les planificateurs et les décideurs à évaluer et à prévenir le risque de surchauffe au niveau du parc bâti, cet ensemble de mesures d\'adaptation est évalué de manière plus poussée dans des quartiers sélectionnés sur les trois villes faisant l\'objet de l\'étude de cas, en utilisant le modèle DECoRuM-Adapt (Domestic Energy, Carbon Counting and Carbon Reduction Model – modèle d\'énergie domestique, de comptabilisation du carbone, et de réduction du carbone), basé sur un système d\'information géographique (SIG). Les implications pour les politiques publiques sont que la pérennité future du parc de logements existant doit être assurée en termes de réchauffement climatique, en recourant en particulier à des programmes de réaménagement (par ex. le New Deal vert) et à toute mise à jour de la réglementation du bâtiment.

Overall, most of the feedback approaches were able to engage and raise awareness amongst the householders. Whilst carbon mapping was felt to be aimed more at community groups and local councils by providing evidence of past and future community action, displaying carbon maps at community workshops helped to show that others were also engaged in energy action. Thermal imaging was successful in engaging individual local residents through both community workshops and home visits, especially when included in the home energy reports.

for installing energy retrofit measures. This paper presents a localised Geographical Information System (GIS) based approach that utilizes publicly-available national and local datasets on housing and energy to provide targeted low carbon measures across UK cities. The study uses a rapid city-level energy assessment approach to spatially identify suitable neighbourhoods for particular retrofit measures, based on relative energy use and fuel poverty ratings. A GIS-based carbon mapping model (called DECoRuM) is then used to estimate energy use and potential for energy reduction on a house-by-house level. The improvement measures are aggregated to encourage bulk installations and drive down installation costs. To identify an appropriate neighbourhood case study area, publicly available datasets were assessed for the town of Bicester (Oxfordshire, UK), which included Ordnance Survey Mastermap, Energy Performance Certificate data (EPC) and sub-national energy statistics available at lower layer super output area (LSOA). When the EPC data for Bicester were compared with the sub-national statistics for Bicester, the average difference was found to be ∼800\\xa0kWh. This is interesting as EPCs represent dwelling specific but modelled data whereas sub-national datasets represent actual but aggregated data. Superimposing the above datasets, a neighbourhood in southwest Bicester was selected as having the highest percentage of dwellings with energy consumption >300\\xa0kWh/m2/yr (EPC), most dwellings in need of wall insulation (EPC), second highest mean total energy consumption (sub-national), and third highest percentage of fuel poor dwellings (sub-national). House-level energy assessment in the selected area using DECoRuM showed that a package based approach comprising fabric and heating system upgrade and solar PVs emerged as the most effective.',

Top-down spatial datasets on energy, housing, socioeconomics and fuel poverty are combined with bottom-up energy modelling underpinned by actual dwelling details gathered through questionnaire surveys by the local community group. Multiple routes to identify suitable dwellings were tested such as grouping dwellings with high energy use, those with high levels of fuel poverty and by common dwelling characteristics. About 300 dwellings were found to be suitable for a whole house retrofit package, equating to 89–94% mean energy reduction over baseline. While the most common dwelling typology, 1930s semi-detached had high retrofit need, it fell in an area with low annual household income. The second most common dwelling typology, 1930s terrace, was dominant in areas with median level of household income.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Pioneering research on the epidemiology of Hepatitis C Virus \(HCV\) by Professor Irving has resulted in health benefits to patients worldwide, improved national and international treatment guidelines and increased international uptake of direct\-acting antiviral drugs. The foundation of HCV Research UK, a national clinical database and biobank resource, supported the NHS Early Access Programme \(EAP\) to provide antiviral drugs ahead of licensing. HCVRUK analysis of the positive outcomes of the EAP encouraged the NHS and other international health providers to adopt these new drugs to treat patients with life\-threatening end stage liver disease, decreasing mortality and requirement for liver transplants associated with HCV infection. Professor Irving’s study of the care pathway of HCV patients from diagnosis to cure, including HCV patients who inject drugs, in the HepCATT study prompted the NHS to introduce a national system for the monitoring of disease prevalence and informed national and international treatment guidelines. The implementation of these guidelines has improved patient outcomes and treatment cost for health care providers. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The World Health Organisation \(WHO\) estimates that 71 million people globally had chronic HCV infection in 2020. In England alone, Public Health England \(PHE\) estimates 89,000 people were living with chronic HCV infection in 2020, of whom an estimated two thirds were undiagnosed. Chronic HCV can cause liver cirrhosis or liver cancer in a significant number of those infected. Three pioneering research initiatives by Professor Irving have delivered considerable insight into the epidemiology and treatment of HCV infection in the UK and internationally: i\) HCV Research UK \(HCVRUK\); ii\) the study of the cascade of care; andiii\) the Hepatitis C Assessment through to Treatment Trial \(HepCATT\) study. 

 <ins>i</ins> <ins>HCVRUK: a research resource for the longitudinal study of HCV infection in the UK</ins> 

 In the early nineties when a test for HCV detection had just come out and little was known about the epidemiology, risk factors and clinical consequences of HCV infection, Professor Irving, funded by the Department of Health \(1993\-2011\) **\[7\]**, GSK and Pfizer **\[8, 9\]**, coordinated the collection of detailed epidemiological data from 2500 HCV patients across the East Midlands, including Nottingham, Sheffield, Derby, Lincoln and Leicester **\[1\]**. This collection of data constituted the Trent Cohort, which became a local proof of concept of the potential of a national\-scale cohort. With the support of the Medical Research Foundation **\[10\],** Professor Irving in collaboration with Professor John McLauchlan \(University of Glasgow\) co\-founded HCVRUK in 2013. 

 HCVRUK \( [hcvresearchuk.org](https://www.hcvresearchuk.org/)\), is a national research infrastructure that aims to facilitate research into all aspects of HCV infection in the UK. It integrates a bespoke database of detailed longitudinal clinical data from 12,000 HCV\-infected patients and a biobank resource of over 150,000 patient samples **\[2\]**. The HCVRUK consortium, co\-chaired by Professors Irving and McLauchlan, includes clinicians from 59 NHS Trusts and Scottish Health Boards, scientists from UK academic centres and public health specialists from PHE and Health Protection Scotland **.** To December 2020, 91 applications have been granted for the use of data and/or biological samples in research studies, including by pharma industry and academia, both in the UK and abroad. Two major studies enabled by HCVRUK and with key involvement of Professor Irving have delivered substantial impact: 

 <ins>i.i</ins> <ins>R</ins><ins>esearch on direct\-acting antiviral \(DAAs\) drugs</ins> <ins>used in</ins> <ins>the NHS Early Access Programme \(EAP\).</ins> In 2014, Professors Irving and McLauchlan co\-led the monitoring of the outcomes of the EAP commissioned by NHS England, wherein patients with advanced liver disease were provided access to the new DAAs ahead of licensing. HCVRUK provided the infrastructure to recruit patients and collect and share clinical data and samples. Professor Irving and collaborators were then able to provide the first published evidence of high cure rates from DAA therapy in this group of patients **\[3\]**. 

 <ins>i.ii</ins> <ins>STratified</ins> <ins>Medicine to</ins> <ins>OPtimise</ins> <ins>the treatment of HCV \(STOP\-HCV\).</ins> Professor Irving and HCVRUK played an important role in securing GBP4,168,144 from the MRC **\[11\]** for the formation of STOP\-HCV \( [stop\-hcv.ox.ac.uk/about\-stop\-hcv](https://www.stop-hcv.ox.ac.uk/about-stop-hcv)\), a consortium of eleven Universities and five pharma companies, led by Oxford University, that was underpinned by HCVRUK’s clinical database and biosamples. Of the seven integrated work strands of STOP\-HCV, Professor Irving co\-led work strand 1 \(provision of well\-characterised HCVRUK patient samples and metadata\) and work strand 5 \(biomarkers\). STOP\-HCV has so far generated over 40 primary publications relating to the pathogenesis, natural history and optimal management of HCV infection **\[4** as an example, with Professor Irving’s authorship in at least 9 other publications since 2015 **\] \[13, 14\]**. 

 <ins>ii</ins> <ins>Research</ins> <ins>into</ins> <ins>HCV patients</ins><ins>’</ins> <ins>cascade of care</ins><ins>.</ins> The cascade of care is the pathway of a patient from diagnostic test, through care and treatment, to cure. Professor Irving, in collaboration with PHE, informed the design of an algorithm that allowed modelling of prevalence of HCV in England, as well as the proportion of HCV patients diagnosed and treated and the proportion of and reasons for patient drop\-out **\[5\].** Additionally, Professor Irving’s research into the cascade of care identified, quantified and validated interventions to improve case finding, referral, treatment uptake, retention in care and cost\-effectiveness. An example of best practice intervention that emerged from Professor Irving’s cascade of care studies is ‘reflex testing’, which sequentially tests a single blood sample both for anti\-HCV antibodies and HCV RNA. Another example is the antiviral resistance testing, which tests the resistance of the virus to DAAs and informs the selection of optimal treatment. 

 <ins>iii</ins> <ins>HepCATT</ins> <ins>Study</ins><ins>.</ins> Over 85% of diagnosed HCV patients in England acquired the infection as a collateral of injecting drugs. In order to significantly reduce overall disease incidence, it is important to study and design strategies that specifically target people who inject drugs \(PWID\). Prompted by earlier local\-scale studies where Professor Irving witnessed large patient drop\-out, he subsequently co\-led the HepCATT study at a national scale \(Department of Health funding **\[12\]**\), which demonstrated the effectiveness of the introduction of health\-care staff in drug treatment clinics in enhancing diagnosis and treatment of HCV\-infected PWID. The cost\-effectiveness of this intervention’s implementation by avoiding the costly hospital setting was further demonstrated **\[6\].**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Professor Irving’s research has been instrumental in setting up the national infrastructure for the study and treatment of HCV in the UK. His studies provided evidence on epidemiology and disease progression as well as generating important findings to benchmark progress towards elimination of HCV by 2030, in accordance with WHO targets. 

 <ins>i</ins> <ins>HCVRUK</ins> <ins> **\[2\]**</ins> <ins>has enabled and improved the treatment of HCV patients, has informed national and international HCV</ins> <ins>patient</ins> <ins>treatment guidelines and has contributed</ins> <ins>to increased international uptake of DAAs:</ins> 

 <ins>i.i</ins> <ins>N</ins><ins>ational and international patient</ins> <ins>benefit of DAAs with better treatment outcomes</ins><ins>.</ins> In 2014, Professors Irving and McLauchlan successfully negotiated with the Department of Health the monitoring of the delivery, reimbursement and outcomes of the NHS EAP using HCVRUK. The co\-chair of the Viral Hepatitis Advisory Group of NHS England at the time and national leader in HCV clinical management said *“…patients with such advanced liver disease were not able to wait for the formal licensing of the drugs…A key component of our argument for early access was the existence of the comprehensive monitoring system available through HCVRUK…Hence the existence of HCVRUK played a pivotal role in the EAP as a bridge between the NHS and the pharmaceutical companies, and ultimately had undoubted benefit to seriously ill patients.”* **\[S1\].** Professor Irving and colleagues identified 806 patients with advanced liver disease as in most urgent need of the new DAAs, ahead of licensing. Of the 711 patients treated with known virological outcomes, 641 \(90%\) were successfully treated **\[S2\]**. Not only did the EAP describe and deliver the optimal care plan for very ill patients, but its clinical success was such that it led to the approval of DAAs and a rapid fall in HCV\-associated mortality and liver transplantation in England. A 2019 PHE report states: *“Since the new DAA drugs have been available...a fall in the number of HCV\-related liver transplants and deaths has been observed”,* with a 38.9% decrease in transplants and 16.3% decrease in deaths from 2014 to 2017 **\[S3\]**. 

 DAAs used during the EAP were supplied by pharmaceutical companies Gilead Sciences Ltd, Bristol\-Myers Squibb and Abbvie. Data collected by HCVRUK during the EAP demonstrated effectiveness and safety of the new DAAs **\[3, S2\]** and provided key epidemiology and patient information for NICE and NHS England to make decisions to treat certain patients with a combination of DAAs and other approved medicines. This data also encouraged clinicians across Europe and North America to treat HCV patients with these drugs, increasing international uptake of DAAs. Medical Director of Gilead stated: *""Without the HCVRUK database there would not only be a paucity of data on the seriousness of HCV infection in the UK but also a far smaller number of patients that had received treatment with the drugs that have been licensed in the past 5 years… the HCVRUK database played a valuable role in supporting our work to obtain NICE approval for the reimbursement of our new HCV medicines, and to provide evidence of the effectiveness of the medicines in clinical practice, thus supporting increased uptake… Following NICE approval … these data added to the body of evidence to give European clinicians confidence that the new medicines were effective in European patients”* **\[S4\].** 

 According to WHO, approximately 5,000,000 people globally had received DAA treatment for HCV by the end of 2017. WHO states that access to DAAs is revolutionising the prospect of ending HCV epidemics. 

 Additionally, HCVRUK and STOP\-HCV provided a framework to deliver a phase 3 study of Sofosbuvir, a new candidate compound for the treatment of HCV by Gilead **\[4\]**. This study provided the evidence for a shorter treatment duration preferred by NHS England **\[S4\]**. 

 <ins>i.ii</ins> <ins>National and international guidelines for patient care were informed.</ins> The European Association for the Study of the Liver \(EASL\) guidelines cite the EAP and HCVRUK studies **\[3** and others **\]** to recommend the use of certain DAA combinations in patients since 2016 **\[S5\]**. The Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver \(APASL\) cite the EAP in their recommendations **\[S5\]**. EASL and APASL guidelines inform the WHO on their recommendations for care and treatment of HCV patients. EASL guidelines inform NICE and Scottish Medicine Consortium \(SMC\) guidelines, which underpin the UK reimbursement strategy for diagnosis and treatment of HCV. 

 Evidence of the major nationwide collaboration achievement that HCVRUK represents is the recognition by the British Association for the Study of the Liver \(BASL\) with the 2019 Service Recognition Award to Professor Irving and his close collaborator Professor McLauchlan. The current chair of BASL said *“HCVRUK has been instrumental in understanding the epidemic of HCV infection and in helping in the efforts towards achieving HCV elimination… In addition to its direct impact on HCV, HCVRUK has had a lasting and much broader impact in establishing a model for collaborative working between scientists and clinicians from across the whole of the U.K.”* **\[S6\].** 

 <ins>ii The study of the c</ins><ins>as</ins><ins>cade of care improve</ins><ins>d</ins> <ins>HCV patient</ins> <ins>outcomes and inform</ins><ins>ed</ins> <ins>guidelines</ins> <ins>for the treatment of HCV</ins><ins>:</ins> 

 Professor Irving’s study of the cascade of care in collaboration with PHE **\[5\]** was designed to better understand and improve engagement and retention in care of chronic HCV patients. The Head of Immunisation and Deputy Director of the National Infection Service at PHE said *“Professor Irving’s cascade of care research has been a seminal piece of work which has been used to inform modelling estimates of prevalence of HCV in England, and the diagnosed and treated proportion since 2006 to date. The modelling estimates and estimating proportion treated are fundamental to monitoring progress towards elimination of HCV as a public health threat–a commitment to the WHO \[HCV elimination\] strategy that the UK government has made”* **\[S7\].** 

 An example of best practice that emerged from the cascade of care studies is ‘reflex testing’, which has now been implemented across England, with 65% of sentinel laboratories routinely undertaking this practice **\[S8\].** Reflex testing decreases patient drop\-out and therefore improves patient outcomes and cost for the health provider. 

 *“In recognition of his research credentials”* **\[S7\]**, Professor Irving was invited to be independent chair for the National Strategic Group for Viral Hepatitis \(May 2017 to present\), the multiagency and multidisciplinary expert group that oversees the National Elimination Strategy \(whose objective is the elimination of HCV infection in the UK by 2030\). Irving’s research data presented to the strategic group was essential to demonstrate that better diagnosis and initiation of treatment of HCV patients by healthcare practitioners leads to improvement in outcomes for the HCV patients and is cost\-effective for the healthcare commissioners. Professor Irving is also member of the PHE Hepatitis C Virus Resistance Group \(2018\-present\) that published the *‘Antiviral resistance testing in the management of hepatitis C virus infection’* guidance in November 2018. This document provides guidance to NHS clinicians for the stratification of HCV patients that present with infections resistant to DAAs **\[S9\]**. 

 <ins>iii</ins> <ins>The</ins> <ins>HepCATT</ins> <ins>s</ins><ins>tudy inform</ins><ins>ed</ins> <ins>national and international guidelines and improve</ins><ins>d</ins> <ins>HCV patient outcomes:</ins> 

 According to PHE, injecting drug use is the most important risk factor for HCV infection in the UK, with one in every four people who inject drugs \(PWID\) infected with HCV in 2020. The number of PWID in England was last estimated in 2011 at over 100,000. Professor Irving specifically reviewed the care received by PWID who are also HCV\-infected in the HepCATT study. HepCATT showed how the diagnosis, treatment pathways and cure of HCV positive PWID improves by investing in healthcare staff in the drug treatment clinics, without involving hospitals, an intervention that is also cost\-effective **\[6\]**. *We Are With You* \(formerly known as Addaction\), a UK charity that works with drug, alcohol and prisons services and helped 130,000 people in 2019, collaborated with Professor Irving in the HepCATT study. As a result of this collaboration, they saw immediate benefits for the people involved in the study, with *“increased engagement of HCV\-positive service users, reducing the gap between diagnosis and treatment…there was increased uptake of testing, referral to hepatology and initiation of treatment”.* The charity also reports a longer\-term benefit: *“the HepCATT study gave us a solid foundation… we were able to enhance the quality of HCV care across the continuum by improving service user outcomes, promoting safety, increasing user service satisfaction, and optimising combined resources”* **\[S10\]**. 

 Following Professor Irving’s recommendations, PHE issued new policy and guidelines on World Hepatitis Day 2019 which highlight the HepCATT study and have led to the improvement of patient outcomes across the UK **\[S11\]**. The Head of Immunisation and Deputy Director of the National Infection Service at PHE said *‘The HepCATT study is one of a few multicentre studies of complex interventions in drug service settings… Professor Irving’s research is timely, relevant and patient and community focused… As more and more commissioners and providers adopt these pathways of care… we expect to see continued and increasing benefits from this research for patients in the UK and globally’* **\[S7\]**. 

 The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction \(EMCDDA\) selected the HepCATT study to be included in a compilation of 11 examples of new models of care from 8 European countries for delivering testing and care to HCV positive PWID. This was also launched and showcased on World Hepatitis Day 2019 **\[S12\]**.

This drug eliminates most chronic HCV infections, and resistance-associated substitutions in the polymerase are rare. However, HCV genotype 3 responds slightly less well to sofosbuvir-based therapies than other genotypes. We collected data from England\\\'s National Health Service Early Access Program to search for virus factors associated with sofosbuvir treatment failure.</AbstractText>\\nMETHODS: <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We collected patient serum samples and used the capture-fusion assay to assess viral sensitivity to sofosbuvir in 14 HCV genotype 3 samples. We identified polymorphisms associated with reduced response and created modified forms of HCV and replicons containing the substitutions of interest and tested their sensitivity to sofosbuvir and ribavirin. We examined the effects of these polymorphisms by performing logistic regression multivariate analysis on their association with sustained virologic response in a separate cohort of 411 patients with chronic HCV genotype 3 infection who had been treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin, with or without pegylated interferon.</AbstractText>\\nRESULTS: <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We identified a substitution in the HCV genotype 3a NS5b polymerase at amino acid 150 (alanine [A] to valine [V]), V at position 150 was observed in 42% of patients) with a reduced response to sofosbuvir in virus replication assays. In patients treated with sofosbuvir-containing regimens, the A150V variant was associated with a reduced response to treatment with sofosbuvir and ribavirin, with or without pegylated interferon. In 326 patients with V at position 150, 71% achieved an sustained virologic response compared to 88% with A at position 150. In cells, V at position 150 reduced the response to sofosbuvir 7-fold. We found that another rare substitution, glutamic acid (E) at position 206, significantly reduced the response to sofosbuvir (8.34-fold reduction); the combinations of V at position 150 and E at position 206 reduced the virus response to sofosbuvir 35.77-fold. Additionally, in a single patient, we identified 5 rare polymorphisms that reduced sensitivity to sofosbuvir our cell system.</AbstractText>\\nCONCLUSIONS: <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">A common polymorphism, V at position 150 in the HCV genotype 3a NS5b polymerase, combined with other variants, reduces the virus response to sofosbuvir. Clinically, infection with HCV genotype 3 containing this variant reduces odds of sustained virologic response. In addition, we identified rare combinations of variants in HCV genotype 3 that reduce response to sofosbuvir.</AbstractText>\', \'original\': None}', 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Peter A.C.',

To determine whether patients newly diagnosed as anti-HCV positive are appropriately referred for further investigation and management, and if not, to determine why not. We studied patients tested for antibodies to HCV by Nottingham Public Health Laboratory in a 2-year period (2000-2002). The progress of newly diagnosed anti-HCV positive patients into specialist clinics for further management was documented. For patients not referred for specialist care, a questionnaire was sent to the clinician requesting the initial anti-HCV test, to identify reasons for nonreferral. Eleven thousand one hundred and seventy-seven patients were tested for anti-HCV. Two hundred and fifty-six (2.3%) were newly diagnosed as being anti-HCV positive. Two per cent of samples sent from primary care were anti-HCV positive, compared to 18.8, 18.9 and 1.3% sent from prison, drug and alcohol units, and secondary care, respectively. About 64.3% of positive patients diagnosed in primary care were referred to specialist care, compared to 18.4, 42.4 and 62.6% of patients diagnosed in the other three settings. One hundred and twenty-five (49%) newly diagnosed patients were referred appropriately for further management. 68 of these attended clinic, 45 underwent liver biopsy and 26 (10%) began treatment. One hundred and thirty-one patients (51%) were not referred. In 54 cases, there was no evidence that the anti-HCV positive result reached the patient. In 15, referral was considered but rejected, and 20 patients were referred to non-HCV-specialists (their general practitioners or to genito-urinary medicine). Hence less than 50% of newly diagnosed anti-HCV positive patients are referred to an appropriate clinic for further investigation and management. Reasons for this are multifarious and complex, reflecting both systems failure and patient choice. Unless these are understood and addressed, the Department of Health Hepatitis C Strategy (2002) and Action Plan for England (2004) will fail to achieve their intended objectives.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': '[{\'first_name\': \'W.

to monitor rates of, and response to, treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) across England using routine laboratory HCV RNA testing data. HCV testing activity between January 2002 and December 2011 was extracted from the local laboratory information systems of a sentinel network of 23 laboratories across England. An algorithm based on frequency of HCV RNA testing within a defined time period was designed to identify treated patients. Validation of the algorithm was undertaken for one center by comparison with treatment data recorded in a clinical database managed by the Trent HCV Study Group. In total, 267,887 HCV RNA test results from 100,640 individuals were extracted. Of these, 78.9% (79,360) tested positive for viral RNA, indicating an active infection, 20.8% (16,538) of whom had a repeat pattern of HCV RNA testing suggestive of treatment monitoring. Annual numbers of individuals treated increased rapidly from 468 in 2002 to 3,295 in 2009, but decreased to 3,110 in 2010. Approximately two thirds (63.3%; 10,468) of those treated had results consistent with a sustained virological response, including 55.3% and 67.1% of those with a genotype 1 and non-1 virus, respectively. Validation against the Trent clinical database demonstrated that the algorithm was 95% sensitive and 93% specific in detecting treatment and 100% sensitive and 93% specific for detecting treatment outcome.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Laboratory testing activity, collected through a sentinel surveillance program, has enabled the first country-wide analysis of treatment and response among HCV-infected individuals. Our approach provides a sensitive, robust, and sustainable method for monitoring service provision across England.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Sam', 'last_name': 'Lattimore',

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Flat\-faced dogs such as pugs, bulldogs and French bulldogs have increased in popularity in the past decade, with French bulldog registrations reaching 36,785 in the UK 2018. However, the flat\-faced features they are known for has led to Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome \(BOAS\) being a common respiratory condition within flat\-faced breeds; medical or surgical intervention is required by 65% of pugs. 

 Research at the University of Cambridge led to the development of the world’s first objective testing criteria for BOAS. The low\-cost Functional Grading Scheme provides a standardised method for veterinarians to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes for affected dogs, where there previously was no such method for quantitative assessment. Within the UK 40 vets are trained in the technique, which was endorsed by the Kennel Club in 2019 and the *Fédération Cynologique Internationale*, which represents pedigree dog organisations in 99 countries, in 2020. 

 Stakeholder and media engagement by the researchers has raised public awareness of BOAS. This has led to a revision of pedigree dog health certification standards, changed how Disney advertised their recent film featuring a pug and contributed to a 38% reduction in the number of flat\-faced dog purchases within the UK from 2018 to 2019.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In recent decades, breeding selection for extreme brachycephalic features \(typically short noses\) has resulted in dogs that are predisposed to upper airway tract obstruction due to an excess of soft tissues in that region, causing respiratory distress. This condition, known as brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome \(BOAS\), is typical in pugs, French bulldogs and bulldogs. 

 This serious and life\-limiting condition has a range of clinical signs, including snoring, exercise intolerance and syncope \(passing out\). A range of surgical interventions are used to treat the condition, reducing symptoms. Affected breeds are increasingly popular, with the Kennel Club  reporting 10,783 pug registrations in 2017, 10,665 bulldog registrations in 2018 and 36,785 French Bulldog registrations in 2018 \(Kennel Club ten\-yearly breed statistics\). The French Bulldog is the UK’s second most registered dog in the UK in 2019, and the British Veterinary Association \(BVA\) recording a 3,488% increase in registrations in the previous decade. 

 Previously, BOAS was diagnosed through physical examination, a subjective process in which different vets employed different definitions of ‘normal’, and lesion assessment under general anaesthesia, which could be risky for the animals because of their respiratory inadequacy. In 2015, the BOAS research group at the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge determined and defined objective parameters to diagnose BOAS in common brachycephalic dog breeds by pioneering the use of whole\-body barometric plethysmography \(WBBP\) chambers to record the breathing flow of un\-sedated dogs. Using a WBBP chamber, the researchers quantified respiratory parameters of French bulldogs before and after exercise. The team developed an objective method to classify respiratory health by grading breathing changes invoked by exercise into four categories \(0 – III, with 0 showing no signs of breathing abnormality and III as the most severe\) \[R1\]. At the same time, they undertook a study comparing owner perception of BOAS and functional grading and found that 60% of owners failed to recognise BOAS in dogs graded II and III, i.e. those experiencing the most severe symptoms \[R1\]. 

 Their method was subsequently tested on pugs and bulldogs as well as French bulldogs in 2016. The team found that methodology predicted BOAS status in each breed with 94\-97% accuracy \[R2\]. Subsequent research has helped to assess the prevalence of BOAS among affected breeds and to validate the clinical efficacy of surgical techniques and their suitability for clinical intervention. 

 In 2017, the team determined prognostic indicators for surgical treatment. Age, body condition, laryngeal collapse and surgical techniques were associated with postoperative prognosis. Median BOAS indices decreased after surgery from 76% to 63%, although dogs with indices in this range are still considered clinically affected \[R3\]. Further research in 2017 analysed data collected on detailed external conformation and body condition score \(BCS\) within breeds who are affected by BOAS. They showed the importance of conformational measurements such as craniofacial ratio \(CFR\), eye width ratio \(EWR\), skull index \(SI\), neck girth ratio \(NGR\), and neck length ratio \(NLR\) as additional diagnostic criteria \[R4\]. The identification of conformational risk factors for BOAS is essential in breeding out this inherited disease. The team also identified that moderate and severe BOAS, requiring medical or surgical intervention, was experienced in 64.6% of pugs, 58.9% of French bulldogs and 51.2% of bulldogs \[R4\]. 

 In the same year, the team sought to validate their grading of BOAS. They found that sensitivity increased from 57% pre\-exercise to 93% after a three\-minute trot test, and sensitivity of laryngeal stridor as a predictor of laryngeal collapse increased from 60% to 70% after exercise \[R5\]. The inclusion of these aspects with their grading highlights the high accuracy the scheme has for detecting BOAS. 

 The development of an effective grading scheme for BOAS has helped researchers to accurately determine the prevalence of the disease in affected breeds for the first time. Their increased knowledge of indicators and treatment options put the team in an exceptional position to raise awareness of the condition and improve the quality of life for brachycephalic dogs.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 BOAS presents a significant health and welfare issue to flat\-faced dog breeds: the 2017 British Veterinary Association’s \( [BVA](https://www.bva.co.uk/take-action/breed-to-breathe-campaign)\) Veterinary Profession survey found that 56% of brachycephalic dogs required treatment for breed\-related health issues. A study published in 2020, examined 22,333 dogs under UK veterinary care; it cites \[R1\] and \[R3\], and strongly shows that brachycephalic breeds are generally less healthy than their non\-brachycephalic counterparts \[E1\]. The increasing popularity of these breeds means that improving breed health by identifying dogs that are not affected by BOAS is essential to improve health and welfare of these dogs. The BOAS research group at the University of Cambridge has transformed the diagnosis and treatment of BOAS, improving animal welfare and health outcomes for pet dogs and their significant public engagement work has had a demonstrable impact in the reduction of pedigree breed registrations. 

 **Changes to professional practice** 

 <ins> **A new respiratory functional grading scheme**</ins> 

 The objective and non\-invasive Functional Grading Scheme created by Ladlow, Liu and Sargan, launched in 2019, and is the world’s first objective testing criteria for BOAS, improving diagnosis, treatment and outcomes for affected breeds. It is the only scheme recommended by the UK Kennel Club. The Kennel Club said: *“The Respiratory Function Grading Scheme is the strongest mechanism we have to show a commitment to tackling BOAS within these breeds”* \[E2\]. Within the UK, 40 vets are currently recommended by the Kennel Club for regional referrals \[E2\], ensuring that brachycephalic breed owners across the UK can now access specialist care for their pets. In 2019, 396 dogs were graded under the scheme \[E2\]. 

 <ins>Global roll out of the scheme</ins> 

 In June 2020, the President of the FCI \(Fédération Cynologique Internationale, representing 99 countries’ pedigree dog organisations\) endorsed the functional grading system, making it available to all FCI member countries via license agreements, and pledged to cooperate with Dr Ladlow to develop guidelines for national organisations \[E3\]. This represents a key change in practice. The Irish and New Zealand Kennel Clubs have already agreed to license the scheme \[E5\]. The president of the New Zealand Kennel Club said: *“The RFG scheme will be immediately designated as a mandatory test for all three breeds under the Accredited Breeders Scheme”* \[E4\]. 

 As well as being supported by the Kennel Club and FCI, the functional grading scheme has been adopted as part of a health certification scheme run by each of the three UK breed councils representing brachycephalic breeds \(Bulldog, French Bulldog and Pug\). These certificates are issued to dogs that represent the healthiest examples of these breeds, and hence increase demand to breed only from the healthiest dogs \[E5\]. 

 <ins>Whole\-body barometric plethysmography \(</ins><ins>WBBP</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>chambers</ins> 

 Following the research into respiratory grading methods, WBBP chambers, which provide objective criteria to validate the test protocol on introduction and to allow further BOAS research, have been installed in leading veterinary hospitals including the Royal Veterinary College in London and the Royal \(Dick\) School of Veterinary Sciences, Edinburgh \[E6\], impacting professional practice. 

 **Improving awareness, reducing demand** 

 Ladlow and Sargan are founding members of the Brachycephalic Working Group \(BWG\), an organisation dedicated to improving the health and welfare of brachycephalic dogs and reducing consumer demand for the breeds \[E7\]. Established in 2016, the BWG was instrumental in the development of the 2018 BVA and British Small Animal Veterinary Association’s \(BSAVA\) *Breed to Breathe* campaign on brachycephaly in pedigree dogs. Vets have been issued a ten\-point practice plan to improve the health and welfare of brachycephalic dogs and promote responsible pet ownership; this includes the use of the functional grading scheme. All vets are strongly encouraged to advise against breeding if a dog is suffering from BOAS \[E8\]. 

 The Senior Vice\-President of the BVA said *, “Flat\-faced dogs have seen a rapid rise in popularity in recent years, which has been fuelled by their prominence in the media, but many people are unaware that their ‘cute’ looks mask serious and often life\-limiting health problems”* \[E9\]. To counteract this, Sargan, Ladlow and the BWG have worked hard to reduce exposure of flat\-faced dogs in the media whilst raising awareness of their health issues to prospective owners. In 2017, as a result of this, Halifax bank removed a marketing campaign that featured a pug: “ *Since being made aware of the health issues associated with flat\-faced dogs, we have reviewed our marketing and advertising materials and will be removing any use of these breeds from our imagery at the earliest opportunity.”* \[E10\]. 

 Sargan and Ladlow appeared in Saving the British Bulldog, a prime\-time 2018 BBC1 documentary that documented the fight against harmful breeding practices and was viewed by almost two million people \[E11\], \[E12\]. Presenter Catherine Tate said *“I just don’t think there is a level of awareness yet that has infiltrated the public, because clearly the dogs are suffering. We as humans have to start putting the dogs first, and I don’t think we are”*. \[E11\]. The documentary sparked debate on social media, with comments including *“Nice to see the Bulldog breeders advocating health testing\! Shame it’s not mandatory\! \#savingthebritishbulldog”* and *“\#SavingTheBritishBulldog is the most amazing thing I’ve watched. Get rid of these bad breeders and keep them a healthy British icon”* \[E12\]. 

 When Disney announced the film *Patrick* \(released June 2018\) about the life of a pug, concerns were raised by the BWG and veterinary community that the high profile film could increase demand for the breed, as had happened in previous films featuring animals. Sargan, Ladlow and Liu and the BWG worked closely with the director and producer of the film \(private communication\) to ensure it was released in a responsible way. Disney UK agreed numerous actions including: they would create no pug\-related merchandise to support the film, a welfare message would be included in the credits explaining health issues, and leaflets would be distributed to the public and journalists at cinemas describing pug health issues \[E9\]. Rather than the anticipated increase in pug registrations previously observed with dog\-focussed films, after the film was released the Kennel Club noted a 38% decrease in pug registrations from 10,783 in 2017 to 6,751 in 2019. \[E9\]. Whilst it is too early to predict long term trends, the Senior Health and Welfare Manager at the Kennel Club said *“We hope the new figures are a sign of our message getting through and that there are now fewer, better\-informed owners buying from responsible breeders”* \[E9\]. 

 The work of Ladlow, Liu and Sargan has been fundamental to the development of an objective and non\-invasive assessment of airway function in flat\-faced dogs. Their work enables practitioners and pet owners to identify risk factors for BOAS and improve clinical diagnosis. Public awareness of the animal welfare problems of BOAS have reduced consumer demand, with 2019 compared to 2018 registrations reduced by 31% in pugs, 8% in French bulldogs and 7% in bulldogs \[E9\]. This marks the first time in a decade these breeds have seen a decrease in numbers \[E9\].

syndrome (BOAS) is an important health and welfare problem in several popular dog breeds. Whole-body barometric plethysmography (WBBP) is a non-invasive method that allows safe and repeated quantitative measurements of respiratory cycles on unsedated dogs. Here respiratory flow traces in French bulldogs from the pet population were characterised using WBBP, and a computational application was developed to recognise affected animals. Eighty-nine French bulldogs and twenty non-brachycephalic controls underwent WBBP testing. A respiratory functional grading system was used on each dog based on respiratory signs (i.e. respiratory noise, effort, etc.) before and after exercise. For development of an objective BOAS classifier, functional Grades 0 and I were considered to have insignificant clinical signs (termed here BOAS-) and Grades II and III to have significant signs (termed here BOAS+). A comparison between owner-perception of BOAS and functional grading revealed that 60 % of owners failed to recognise BOAS in dogs that graded BOAS+ in this study.WBBP flow traces were found to be significantly different between non-brachycephalic controls and Grade 0 French bulldogs; BOAS- and BOAS+ French bulldogs. A classifier was developed using quadratic discriminant analysis of the respiratory parameters to distinguish BOAS- and BOAS + French bulldogs, and a BOAS Index was calculated for each dog. A cut-off value of the BOAS Index was selected based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the classifier on the training group (n=69) were 0.97, 0.93, 0.95, and 0.97, respectively. The classifier was validated using a test group of French bulldogs (n=20) with an accuracy of 0.95. WBBP offers objective screening for the diagnosis of BOAS in French Bulldogs. The technique may be applied to other brachycephalic breeds affected by BOAS, and possibly to other respiratory disease in dogs.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Demand poses a serious challenge to UK police forces, often shown to outstrip the resources available to meet it and consequently requires forces to prioritise demand and restrict what services they provide to the public. Research conducted by Dr **Walley** at the Open University investigated the non\-urgent demand in the control room of Gloucestershire Constabulary \(GC\) by using a “failure demand’’ perspective.  Through the introduction of demand management and demand reduction techniques based on the research’s applied theory, GC was able to improve its ability to meet demand and its response times, reduce officer workload and save significant amounts of money through reduced staffing costs. The successful results achieved by GC led to further funding and engagement by other police forces and programmes, resulting in further impact to professional practice. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services \(HMICFRS\) independently assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of police forces and fire & rescue services. Their reports have consistently pointed towards the police’s inability to meet demand over the last 10 years. The decline in police officer numbers, which have fallen by 14% since 2009, has contributed to workload pressures which mean that forces are often unable to answer and respond to many of the 93,000 emergency calls per day. This demand only represents 20% of the total public demand from calls to the police, showing the vast scale of what services police need to provide. 

 Research conducted by Dr Paul **Walley** at The Open University from 2015 – present has provided a valuable methodology and an evidence base for improved demand and capacity management.  The early work in 2015 **\[O3\]** was a scoping study which identified existing demand and capacity techniques that could be used in policing, to act as a basis of further improvement. **Walley** has since promoted improvement of public service capacity management practices through the application of ""failure demand analysis"" in both healthcare **\[O2\]** and police **\[O4\]**. The healthcare work **\[O2\]** highlighted the extent to which existing systems generated their own unnecessary demand, leading to system failure.  In policing **\[O4\] Walley** was able to demonstrate the trade\-offs between responsiveness and efficiency. 

 From January to July 2017, in the core piece of research **\[O1, O5\]**, a representative sample of historical non\-urgent incidents from Gloucestershire Constabulary \(GC\) was taken and completely reviewed by a team of police officers and staff, under instruction from **Walley**. Typically, 80 different pieces of information about each incident were extracted from records that included the audio recordings of calls coming in, with the call handler’s response.  The work undertaken to analyse demand created a number of insights into the ways in which police manage demand that had not been previously observed.  First, the work highlighted how the existing prioritisation systems employed by GC \(and still practiced by other police forces\) have a detrimental effect on response times to some relatively urgent incidents. Second, the unique analysis of demand entering the system showed how up to 38% of all demand entering the system was created by failing to deal with demand first time without error.  Thirdly, the analysis established a clear link between the impacts of the prioritisation system and the existence of unnecessary demand.  For example, 

where the prioritisation system suggests a delayed response to an incident, this increases the likelihood of someone calling back with a further incident to report. 

 The research **\[O1, O5\]** produced recommendations that GC make significant adjustments to how work was dealt with when it came in, which included the production of a new ‘Demand Management Matrix’ that radically re\-defined how demand should be prioritised and met by GC personnel, shown in the figure left.  For example, it was shown that up to 45% of all demand could be dealt with immediately, either over the phone or with some other remote form of resolution **\[O5\]**.  At the time GC were only dealing with 18% of demand in this way.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> **Research\-based recommendations were adopted by Gloucestershire Constabulary, resulting in changes to best practice and professional training**</ins> 

 As an immediate consequence of the research outcomes and recommendations produced by **Dr Walley**, GC adopted a new model for the dispatch and resolution of work coming into their control centre, as part of a much wider demand and capacity management improvement programme **\[C1, C2\]**. The changes included **\[C1\]**: 

1.  Channel management: improving all the ways in which demand enters the system. 

1.  Control room improvement: the control room processes were redesigned in 2018, especially to understand the demand/capacity balance at any one time. 

1.  Developing partnerships with other agencies. 

1.  Better integration of reactive policing with proactive work such as safeguarding. 

1.  Improvements to HR activities, such as CPD. 

 GC devised 6 categories of demand response based on **Walley’s** matrix: 1\) Emergency demand \(met in person\) 2\) Priority in person attendance 3\) Remote investigation 4\) Neighbourhood resolution 5\) First contact resolution 6\) Hand over demand to a more appropriate agency **\[C2**, p.15 **\]**. Additionally, as per the recommendations by **Walley**, they also ran additional training for control centre staff, a reconfiguration of back office support, and a redefining of criteria for allocating work to dispatch **\[C1\]**. These allowed GC to make radical changes to their performance. 

 The graph below shows changes in how the work is dealt with, introduced in July 2014, reducing the amount of in\-person contact by 65%. In the first full month with the new system 43% of all police response was a remote or first contact resolution, compared with 26% for the same month the year before. **\[C2**, p16 **\]**: 



 
The work conducted by **Walley** **\[O5\]** discovered that out of every 100 incidents, 160 items of work were generated, of which 60 would be unnecessary or avoidable. By shifting how demand was met, a reduction of in\-person visits by police officers to non\-urgent events led towards greater use of first contact \(remote\) resolution. This meant that advice or other support was provided by the call handler rather than the work being passed to other force employees, reducing officer workload. 

 A comparison of demand percentages a year before and a year after the changes were implemented, shown in the figure right, further demonstrates this shift in how demand was met **\[C2**, p.17 **\]**. 

 <ins> **Recommendations by The Open University led to significant</ins> <ins>improvements in performance, efficacy,</ins> <ins>reduced workload,</ins> <ins>and cost savings</ins> <ins>which have enabled GC to deal with life threatening incidents more promptly**</ins> 

 The changes, detailed above, made by GC based on recommendations from Dr **Walley** have resulted in significant improvements to performance and efficacy. Testimonial from a Superintendent at GC states that “ *We are now able to resolve about a quarter of all non\-urgent calls in one touch, without the need for a follow\-up visit of call. Our estimate is that this proportion has doubled since the change were implemented from July 2017. The proportion of calls where attendance is delayed fell from 82% to 52% over the same period. Our own internal estimate is that we were able to halve the amount of wasted repeat calls or visits as a consequence of the actions taken*” **\[C1\]**. The changes in call handling behaviour and demand resolution have led to a considerably reduced workload on front\-line officers. 

 These changes mean fewer calls are entering the control centre system. The combination of all the changes at GC has allowed the centre to improve its call response times for both urgent and non\-urgent demand. For example, the control centre was previously unable to meet the national response time target of 10 seconds to pick up a 999 call, but testimonial from GC confirms that “ *\[t\]here have also been significant improvements in responsiveness to urgent calls, where we were able to meet our target of answering within 10 seconds on a more regular basis*” **\[C1\]**. In 6 months, this average has been reduced to 9 seconds. The figure below shows the key change in 999 performance \[graph based on performance data shared by Gloucestershire Constabulary, which can be corroborated by the stakeholder providing testimonial **\[C1\]**. 



 GC is now able to identify specific incidents where this improved performance has saved lives. In one case a call was picked up within the target time, but the caller only had time to shout her name before an assailant cut the call. The force was able to identify the caller, her location and were able to prevent her from being murdered in an ""honour"" killing \(she was found tied up in the boot of the assailant's car\). 

 The impact of Dr **Walley’s** research is captured well in the testimonial provided by GC: “ **Dr** Paul **Walley’s** research has had a huge impact on efficiency and efficacy in GC. His collaboration with GC has resulted in an improved capability to understand the demand in our system and how we can make changes to eliminate unnecessary work”* **\[C1\]**. 

 <ins> **The research has enabled</ins> <ins>GC</ins> <ins>to continue and enhance</ins> <ins>the analysis of demand conducted by The Open University</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>to continue working towards best practice**</ins> 

 The method applied by Dr **Walley** to the analysis of demand was judged as highly effective within GC, resulting in ‘ *an additional legacy*’ as senior managers were motivated to replicate this analysis to develop their own internal capability to sustain the demand management practices **\[C1\]**.  One area they looked at as a consequence of this work were additional calls that enter the Force Control Room but are not recorded as incidents, which were outside the scope of the original study. It is reported that 19.5% of calls to the control room via 101 non\-emergency lines were to contact an officer or gain an update on a matter already being investigated **\[C2**, p.17 **\]**. This analysis led to a force wide initiative to ensure staff phone number were correct. The testimonial from GC emphasises this additional impact, stating that “ *\[w\]e made changes to the ways our own officers used the system, resulting in further reductions in unnecessary demand and improvements in responsiveness*” **\[C1\]**. 

 <ins> **The successful results achieved by GC led to further funding and engagement by other police forces and programmes, resulting in further impact to professional practice**</ins> 

 As a result of the dissemination of the research and the significant success of the work with GC, a project team funded by the National Police Chiefs’ Council \(NPCC\), the national coordination body for law enforcement in the UK, commissioned **Walley** to work on a large change programme hosted by South Yorkshire Police. This evaluation **\[C3\]**, which is an integral part of the programme led by NPCC, involved 15 case studies of national practice in police forces. Described as “ *one of the programme’s key outputs*”, the report was disseminated by The Open University, the NPCC and South Yorkshire police and “ *circulated to all 43 police forces and uploaded to the programme’s Knowledge Hub Page, which current has over 380 members*” **\[C4\]**.  Testimonial from South Yorkshire Police confirms that “ *the report led to recommendation for the forces, and we are confident that it will be used in a similar way for other forces across the UK*’ **\[C4\]**. Furthermore, the programme to which the report contributed “ *ultimately resulted in the team receiving further funding to continue our work to create opportunities to reduce demand for police and partners*”, signalling new and continuing impact in the future **\[C4\]**. 

 This report produced a further request from British Transport Police \(BTP\) who commissioned **Walley** to conduct review work consistent with the research done with GC. Preliminary findings were presented in October 2019 **\[O4\]**. BTP provide testimonial that this analysis provided clear guidance that fed directly into capacity planning, funding, and changes to professional practice for BTP: “ *The work supported us to refine our own capacity model, used to inform the Chief Constable’s Group about the likely capacity required to maintain service levels \[…\] Whilst* **Dr** **Walley** provided that overall expertise and guidance his work also generated assurance amongst our Chief Officer Group”* **\[C5\]**. Furthermore, the work conducted by **Walley** “ *provided us with recommendations on how \[the model\] could be improved and evolve in the future. This had a significant impact on trust in the model and its funding. The output of the model has been used in various ways since, to direct resourcing and budget*” **\[C5\]**. 

 In summary, the research conducted by Dr **Walley** into sustainable ways to manage or reduce demand have had a significant impact on the performance of one force and has contributed towards best practice and changes to demand management in other forces and groups.

<p>This research into how criminal justice practitioners and service providers in the UK can support victims-survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) leveraged over £7.2 million in funding to expand a GBV-prevention programme in the UK. This program is shown to reduce abuse by high-risk perpetrators by up to 88% and underpinned new UK family court guidance to protect children from domestic abuse.

<h6>Advances in the Neuroscience of Trauma & Crime: Transforming justice globally for vulnerable people in custody</h6>
<p>Research uncovered that 42,000 people currently in UK prisons have some form of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), which is associated with impulsivity and problems in social reasoning. This finding changed judicial and health policies in the UK and (those endorsed by the UN) UN to take account of TBI and Neurodisability. It also led to changes in practice across the prison system impacting 83,000 existing prisoners and 60,00 new entrants each year, including mandatory neurodisability screening and enhanced support and staff training.

<p>Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) creates housing developments that are less vulnerable to crime, with housing built to Secured by Design (SBD) standards that experience 55% less burglary. This changed government planning guidance and building regulations in the UK and the United Arab Emirates and increased the number of secure homes (44% of new homes built between 2013 and 2017 were SBD), which reduced crime and increased feelings of safety.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Sound insulation research by Edinburgh Napier has led to multiple impacts such as **influencing changes to international sound insulation ISO criteria.** New building standards developed led to **the highest sound insulation standards globally** for multi\-storey housing. New technical designs have been used in **580,000 new homes** across the UK with **asset values of GBP110billion**. Innovative acoustic **products from waste streams** have been developed leading to **industry sector ‘world firsts’**, achieving **gold level sustainability**, high sound insulation performance, improving quality of life and reducing landfill. **International license agreement** for new product was formed with a **global multinational partner** through co\-authored **patent** leading to new **manufactured products in the UK**. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 High levels of sound insulation in housing are of critical importance to reducing annoyance, sleep disturbance and providing a better quality of life. Napier’s Institute for Sustainable Construction and Building Performance Centre have led sound insulation research both for new products and building standards in the UK and internationally led by Professor Sean Smith and Richard Mackenzie. 

 In 2001 the Scottish Executive funded **\[P1\]** the Napier team, led by Smith, to review housing and sound insulation in Scotland as Napier had the UK’s most detailed on\-site test performance database.  The findings demonstrated that design and product modifications to future housing build systems could deliver higher sound insulation standards encompassing a range of low, mid and high sound frequencies **\[O1\]**. In 2001\-03 some countries were considering amending their building regulations for more emphasis towards low frequency sound insulation. The Napier team then recalculated the impacts of the proposed changes using the **\[P1\]** data analysis. The findings in 2003 **\[O2\]** indicated the difficulty of addressing all frequencies if a new future ISO criteria focused primarily on low frequencies. 

 In 2007 the Napier team focused on potential future changes to ISO 717 sound insulation criteria standards or harmonisation of acoustic criteria **\[O3\]**. This identified that heavy and lightweight core building structures would be differently affected and there would be a ‘ceiling limit’ for low frequency focused adjustments, at the detriment of sound insulation for normal living noise frequencies. During 2006\-08 the Napier research team, led by Mackenzie were funded **\[P2\]** by Scottish Government to lead the development of the new building standards for Scotland, Section 5:Noise **\[O4\]**. The research identified that setting the criteria at a specific level could avoid using low frequency correction factors and still achieve high levels of sound insulation. 

 As a result of **\[O1\-04\]** Smith was invited \(2009\-13\) to lead one of the three working groups for COST Action TU0901 to assess sound insulation performance, construction types **\[P3\]** and develop a harmonized sound insulation approach across a partnership involving 32 countries. Key findings from this work were the issue of low frequencies and the resultant ‘limited’ modal responses for small rooms and the uncertainty for measurement accuracy **\[O6\]**. Small rooms restrict the number of acoustic modes that can form within the volume dimensions and as a result the less acoustic modes per frequency band the greater the variation in what the microphones can detect. This increases uncertainty in the on\-site test sound insulation results can negatively impact the regulatory process for compliance and accurate reporting of products and construction performance. 

 In 2010 following changes to Part L of the energy efficiency building regulations requiring separating wall cavities to be fully filled, Robust Details funded Napier **\[P4\]** to assess the implications of both roll and blown fibre insulations on acoustic frequency performance. The Napier study demonstrated that whilst there was a slight reduction due to fibres overall both product types could be utilised within future construction specifications. 

 During 2009\-13 Smith led the Low Carbon Building Technologies Gateway and undertook a review on behalf of 2G Environmental and British rigid foam industry body \(BRUFMA\) and supported by public body Zero Waste Scotland to investigate low, mid and high frequency response for rigid foam waste streams **\[P5\]**. A significant majority of thermal rigid insulation board ‘off\-cuts’ were going to landfill. The findings identified a novel acoustic performance benefit due to the acoustic tortuosity factor \(caused by shredded ‘green crumb’ waste particles\). 

 In 2014 Smith was invited on behalf of Eurogypsum to undertake a review of draft proposed changes to international standard ISO 717 **\[P6\] \[O5\]**. The proposed changes would alter the regulatory criteria for sound insulation globally. His report findings illustrated this could lead to an increase in noise complaints and the recommendation would be to not adopt this new criteria approach.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of this research over the REF period has been multi\-factor and includes: 

-  delivering **globally world leading building standards for sound insulation**; 

-  contributing to the **stoppage of a proposed draft ISO international standard** which would have resulted in a worse sound insulation criteria, and reduced quality of life for building occupants; 

-  developing **‘world first’** acoustic products from thermal insulation landfill waste streams; 

-  industry adoption of acoustic specifications for sound insulation products in the development of **580,000 new homes** across the UK with a **combined asset value of GBP110billion.** 

 <ins> **New sound insulation standards**</ins> 

 The outputs **\[O1, O2, O3\]** on frequency spectra and construction influenced the report on new sound insulation standards and recommendations to government **\[O4\]**. This report **\[O4\]** was then accepted following public consultation by the government. The new Section 5: Noise building standards was delayed for full implementation to all sites, due to the economic downturn and legacy warrants. From October 2013 **all new housing sites in Scotland** were required to build to the new technical domestic standards, which included the Section 5: Noise requirements **\[C1\]** developed by Napier’s research team. The Napier research applied to sound insulation standards and design guidance for all walls and floors for houses and apartments. During the period 2014\-15 to 2018\-19, **90,000 homes were built in Scotland to these new standards \[C2\].** Taking the average new build house price since 2014, this equates to at least **GBP13 billion of assets**, which have been designed and built in Scotland to the Napier wall and floor construction specifications and criteria set within these standards. 

 <ins> **World Leading Sound Insulation Standards and Compliance**</ins> 

 One of the key outputs of the EU COST Action TU0901 **\[P3\]** was the comparison of all countries which undertook on\-site sound insulation testing and their regulatory sound insulation compliance criteria. For Scotland the Napier led new sound insulation standards were found in 2014 to have the **world’s highest regulatory level for airborne sound insulation for multi\-storey housing** \(i.e. apartments\) **\[C3\]**. 

 <ins> **Influencing ISO 717 – International Standards**</ins> 

 The 2014 report by Smith for Eurogyspum **\[O5\]**, which also incorporated the early research findings of **\[O6\]** identified that the proposed draft changes for ISO 717 sound insulation criteria would, if adopted, significantly affect the quality of life and lead to more noise complaints. In addition, the proposal would require companies to undertake extensive new testing of all acoustic products. Companies which are members of Eurogypsum have a turnover of over EUR7.5 billion, operate 200 factories and employ 28,000 staff. As such the draft ISO proposal would also impact on their and many other sector companies future business operations. Smith’s report was distributed to the ISO working group prior to the Berlin ISO meeting in April 2014 and **the ISO draft changes were halted**. The UK representative at the Berlin ISO decision meeting reported to Smith, “ *your report was the first to encapsulate all of the arguments and key technical facts. Many countries supported your arguments …the proposed changes to ISO 717 for extending to low frequencies has been cancelled.… your report added sufficient weight to the debate such that it ensured that there was no significant room to permit counter arguments*” **\[C4\].<ins>New Innovative Products**</ins> 

 Utilising the knowledge from **\[O1\-O3\],** Smith’s research investigating converting rigid foam waste streams into recycled shredded ‘green crumb’, **\[P5\]** led to enhanced sound insulation performance and new insights to acoustic material benefits. The test were undertaken at the Building Performance Test Centre in Fife, part of the Napier University acoustic test facilities. In March 2015, the British rigid foam insulation trade body \(formerly BRUFMA\), who supported the project to reduce landfill stated the **application of such waste materials into acoustic products** as a sector **“ **world first**” and achieved Gold level, the highest level for sustainability** **\[C5\]**. Government agency co\-funder of the project Zero Waste Scotland stated “ *that this work supports and offers an important means of diverting a valuable construction material from landfill, giving it a longer life, and improving resource efficiency*” **\[C6\].** 

 <ins> **Licensing to Global Company & Manufactured in UK**</ins>Smith’s research **\[O1\-O4\]** led to a new PhD project to investigate multi\-frequency response of resilient ceiling bars and ceiling hangers with early career researcher Su Shenzhi. The outcomes of this research led to a **new international industry partnership** with Illinois Tool Works \(ITW\) which **operates in 55 countries** **\[C7\]** resulting in a **license agreement** and **granted patent in 2017** **\[C7\].** The new resilient ceiling hanger **increases sound insulation performance**, provides a **dedicated cavity zone for future low carbon building services**, and has a pre\-installed easy fix approach, **improving health & safety for site operatives** when working at ceiling heights, compared to traditional ceiling fixings **\[C8\].** The **product is manufactured in the UK.** 

 <ins> **Acoustic Solutions aligned to Energy Efficiency**</ins> 

 The technical compatibility research for Robust Details **\[P4\]** combining thermal and acoustic performance of fibre based insulations for separating walls led to the full incorporation of this approach for all masonry robust detail designs. As each attached house or apartment built with robust detail specifications is registered on a national database it is possible to track which acoustic specification \(Robust Detail construction\) is registered. Since August 2013 to April 2020 over **490,000 new attached homes have been registered and built** **\[C9\]** using Smith’s masonry separating wall and outer wall specifications, incorporated into a combined **asset value of over GBP98 billion** \(using average new build house prices\). 

 **In summary:** 

-  **90,000 new homes built in Scotland** using the research underpinned Scottish building regulations and guidance constructions, and 

-  **490,000 homes** where industry adopted the research underpinned robust detail acoustic\-energy solution technical specifications in England & Wales, resulting in a total of 

-  **580,000 homes being built incorporating the research findings, in a combined pan\-UK asset value of GBP110billion**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Research Group on Development of Intelligent Environments creates and improves methods and tools from Software Engineering, Human\-computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence, through direct interaction with societal problems, notably those connected with health conditions. The Middlesex born innovation has advanced Computer Science generating measurable impacts in several directions and citizen groups often neglected by the technology giants. Here we present three of those areas: increasing inclusion for people with Down's syndrome, providing ambient assisted living support for older people in their homes, and encouraging citizens to be more physically active.  Our research on context\-aware systems guides our development and delivery of systems better tailored to the needs of individuals with specific needs. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Intelligent Environments are closely related to areas such as Ubiquitous Systems and IoT systems, and refer to systems which exist in a physical environment enriched with sensing technology and Artificial Intelligence algorithms to provide context\-sensitive help to humans. Specific challenges in these systems around the core concepts of contexts and context\-awareness, which our work focus on. There has been work on contexts from an Artificial Intelligence perspective led by J. McCarthy in the 80’s and 90’s and then focused on how inferences in different contexts relate to each other in general. However our work is much more guided by the specific needs from practical contexts and what users expect from system services in those contexts. 

 Our research group \( [http://ie.cs.mdx.ac.uk/](http://ie.cs.mdx.ac.uk/)\) has been working to improve the development of Intelligent Environments \(IE\) since its creation in 2013. Amongst the challenges we faced there were those on the engineering side with a lack of methods and tools specifically helpful for developing these types of systems.  Also, despite the interesting advances in AI, these powerful algorithms did not offer the right balance on expressiveness and efficiency to be run in systems with low resources and with fast reactions expected.  Advice on engineering Intelligent Environments \(IEs\) systems has been patchy or not transferrable.  Hence, we created our own refined versions of existing approaches to system development, including the “User\-centred Intelligent Environments Development Process” \[Augusto et al., 2017\], an iterative process centred on stakeholder’s engagement.  Part of that high level strategy also included our own method to gather “Requirements for Intelligent Environments” and an “Ethical Framework for Intelligent Environment Development *”* which were used to influence requirements and from there the whole system \[Jones et al., 2015\]. These were then complemented with specific strategies for “Context\-aware Systems Testing and Validation” \[Augusto et al., 2020a\], \[Augusto et al., 2020b\]. 

 In applying AI we have specialized algorithms to make known AI techniques to work in real life IE scenarios. Our algorithms include real\-time temporal reasoning to automate sensorized environments \[Gimenez\-Manuel et al., 2020\], machine learning to learn user’s habits \[Ali et al., 2019\], and handling possibly conflicting user preferences \[Oguego et al., 2018\].  Those automated learning and reasoning algorithms combined with context\-awareness resources and specialized interfaces provide a new system architecture \[Augusto et al., 2020a\] for intelligent environments. This consistent and integrated innovation allowed our team to win the BCS Machine Intelligence Competition RealAI \(2019 edition\):  [http://www.bcs\-sgai.org/micomp/intro.php](http://www.bcs-sgai.org/micomp/intro.php) 

 These advances on user\-centred engineering processes and tools facilitated the identification of relevant contexts and development of context\-awareness required for the successful development and deployment of real\-life services within various projects including: 

-  Supporting independence for people with Down’s syndrome \(Supported during 2013\-2016 by the EU through a 4M Euros funded project: “PersOnalized Smart Environments to increase Inclusion of people with DOwn's syndrome \(POSEIDON\)”\): to decide when users require advice or are in an emergency, or determine the system reaction in those detected contexts.  Contexts of interest are usually organized at system level \(e.g., battery level and connectivity\), person level \(e.g., physical or mental status\), and environment level \(e.g., weather or bus service\). 

-  Ambient Assisted Living \(Partly supported during 2016\-2019 by the EU through a 700K Euros funded project: “SecUre aCCESSibility for the internet of things \(SUCCESS\)”\): the contexts our Smart Home system detects unhealthy sleeping patterns, unhealthy eating patterns, and ‘wandering’, all of which are well known to be meaningful to people experiencing dementia\-like conditions.  These contexts are detected through a specially designed rule\-based temporal reasoning system fed by sensor data. House behaviour adapts to user preference through personalization interfaces and unsupervised learning algorithms.   The Smart Home system was set up as part of the Smart Spaces lab in our campus:  [http://ie.cs.mdx.ac.uk/smart\-spaces\-lab/](http://ie.cs.mdx.ac.uk/smart-spaces-lab/) 

-  Encouraging increase in physical activity within Barnet \(a collaboration supported from 2018 onwards with £136,000 by Greenwich Leisure Limited, a charity company based in London working in the sports market with branches all over the UK, and by Barnet Council\):  this is a Gamification project to encourage citizens to be more physically active.  The system achieves that by combining various techniques stemming from psychology \(for example, behaviour change techniques or BCTs\) which relate individual behavioural contexts to personalized habit formation and lifestyles changes.  The stakeholders centred approaches and methods to identify and develop the context\-awareness of the system have been used in this project. This project is currently ongoing and use in the community was delayed for a year due to Covid, so it is expected to start trialled in the community after spring 2021.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The systems we developed based on our user\-centred systems engineering improvements and in our context\-awareness reasoning and learning algorithms improvements described in section 2 were used to create systems which had a diversity of positive effects: 

 <ins>Societal</ins> <ins>Impact</ins><ins>:</ins> our systems contributed to the quality of life of different sectors of society with special needs.  Some of them such as people with Down’s Syndrome are usually very much neglected by technology as they are not appealing to the larger dominant innovation companies dominating the digital markets. During the POSEIDON project a total of 200 EU citizens \(PwDS, carers and representatives of national organizations supporting PwDS\) participated from the workshops and pilots. We gathered evidence people with Down’s Syndrome were both keener and more able to use modern digital solutions than previously perceived \(see supporting evidence \[So1\]\).  Our system to support people with early stages of dementia relate to an increasing section of our ageing population who is willing to stay independent and healthier for longer whilst the human resources required are not sufficient.  There is also increasing awareness in society about the negative effects of sedentary life on humans’ health.  Our system to encourage more active lifestyles is building on that awareness to encourage citizens in Barnet to do more physical activity and benefit from that. Some features of the system aims to increase self\-esteem, others to provide reasons for habit building and others to increase social contact within the community \(see supporting evidence \[So2\]\). 

 <ins>Capacity\-building</ins> <ins>Impact</ins><ins>:</ins> as part of various projects we developed and perfected methods and tools. They are available in project repositories \(see supporting evidence \[Ca1\]\) which we also disseminated through Tutorials and Keynotes at International Conferences as well as eight research students which are now innovators working in other organizations, half of them in business/industry.    Our most recent application of the principles and tools we have designed to assist citizens with context awareness has been used by a company, GLL, to transition from traditional gym based physical activity as their only business model into incorporating app supported individual and team based physical activity.  \(see supporting evidence \[Ca2\]\) 

 <ins>Cultural</ins> <ins>Impact</ins><ins>:</ins> we informed relevant decision\-makers of the findings of our research which have impact in their specific section of society: 

-  We helped Down’s Syndrome associations to understand how people with Down’s Syndrome were able to increase independence and improve lifestyle choices through digital tools and how that can improve daily life experience for the family as a whole \(see supporting evidence \[So1\]\). 

-  We also informed three teams of senior managers from different boroughs in London about the potential of Ambient Assisted Technologies to provide a digital safety net and point of advice to citizens experiencing early symptoms of dementia\-like conditions \(see \[So2\]\). 

 <ins>Economic</ins> <ins>Impact</ins><ins>:</ins> given our products were not marketed by ourselves and consisted of prototypes, methods and tools which help then design other marketable products, we rely on third parties reporting of economic impact.  From our products the one which had best traceable benefits so far is our contribution to POSEIDON which has been used since by one of the Scandinavian companies involved in the project.  The company used the concepts developed with our help during POSEIDON to improve their offer resulting in a number of different variants of specific products which have been delivered to the European market, especially in the North of Europe. These reportedly produced financial gains to the company which are described to the extent they are traceable by the company Karde \(see supporting evidence \[Eco1\]\). 

 <ins>International Reach:</ins> some of our activities involved partners from outside the UK and we are aware that at least at European level our work on supporting the developments of contexts and their linking with specific situations of interest for citizens with specific needs has been exploited by a Scandinavian company.  Also as part of the legacy of the POSEIDON project we have raised awareness of the digital possibilities for this section of society and we are aware EDSA \(the European Down’s Syndrome Association\) still considers the project an important landmark \(see supporting evidence \[Int1\]\).  An independent U.S.A. based science journalist who has written for several of the most important USA newspapers have made several interviews on our work within the Ambient Assisted Living area to include our views and work in an upcoming book addressing the impact of technology in modern indoor living \[Int2\]. POSEIDON is one of the 90 global projects pre\-selected for the World Sumit on the information Society Prizes 2020 edition \[Int3\].

 \[So1\] POSEIDON participant’s questionnaires, interviews, workshops and pilots attracted participation of hundreds of families across Europe. Their feedback and statements from the various non\-academic stakeholders were positive on usefulness and usability and can be consulted in the deliverables available in the project webpage:  [http://www.poseidon\-project.org/research\-scientists/deliverables/](http://www.poseidon-project.org/research-scientists/deliverables/)  See also testimony of this in letter issued by DSA\-UK and signed by the organization representative.  The POSEIDON project then led to a smaller and more focused project with one of their branches: DSActive.  They commissioned from us an exploratory research project funding a Master by Research student who produced a prototype of an app to educate children with DS on the concept of healthy food.  See letter signed by DSACtive. 

 \[So2\] See letter from London Housing Association where they acknowledge their visit to our Hendon Campus Smart Home helped them to understand the benefits of work in this area and also the impact that caused on the visitors and the actions they will take in their respective boroughs: “ *…the visit to the lab changed for better their perception of what is feasible with Smart Homes technological augmentation …. Participants agreed on the importance of taking the knowledge gained from the workshop to their local authorities and other organisations.*”.

-  the Research Group Github:  [https://github.com/GOODIES\-RG](https://github.com/GOODIES-RG) 

 These have been used to create the innovation in the three application clusters we have described, and externally at least by Karde \(one of the Scandinavian partners of POSEIDON\). 

 \[Ca2\] letter from GLL explaining the benefits of engagement with our Research Group on exploring Personalized Behaviour Change Techniques as an alternative to their business options. 

 \[Eco1\]  See letter signed by the C.E.O. of Karde company, a previous partner of our POSEIDON project, where they acknowledge: 

-  the positive influence of our participation in the group: “ *The collaboration with Middlesex University in the POSEIDON project had an impact on society through better understanding of the skills of people with learning disabilities and their abilities to become independent members of the society and actively take part in the working life. Also, our activities had a positive influence on public policy and services towards the target group because of increased attention from politicians and public sector. Finally, our collaboration increased the quality of life for the target group through more independence and better integration in the society.*” 

-  and the financial benefits that taking part of POSEIDON brought to their organization “ *Since POSEIDON Karde has won several national and international contracts for projects which aims to help people with learning disabilities. You may say following the spirit of POSEIDON. The projects have lasted one\-two years and have had budgets on around 50.000 \- 200.000 euros. Karde has had about 20 projects at an average of 100.000 euros which adds up to 2.000.000 euros in the period 2015 – 2020. It will be wrong to say that all of them are results of POSEIDON, but it can be fair to say that 50% is in the POSEIDON spirit, making e\-learning and support systems for people with learning disabilities.*”.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study describes impact across four areas: \(1\) the research has led to a new, evidence\-based lifestyle intervention based on group singing, leading to improved outcomes for women with symptoms of postnatal depression; \(2\) music and health practitioners have used the research findings to inform their practice, methods, and ideas; \(3\) the research has influenced the development of policy with respect to the provision of maternal and creative health services; \(4\) public awareness of the mental health benefits of singing has been raised via dissemination of the research and subsequent media coverage. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The RCM has pioneered research into music, health, and wellbeing for the past decade. From 2015, with funding from Arts Council England, Dr Perkins and her team led the first large\-scale, systematic project to investigate how music can be used to support maternal mental health. With around one in eight women in the UK experiencing postnatal depression \(PND\) and challenges with existing treatment models, the research met an important health need. 

 The cornerstone of the research was a three\-armed Randomized Controlled Trial \(RCT\) run in 2016 to establish whether group singing could support recovery from PND. 134 women with symptoms of PND were randomly allocated to either 10 weeks of group singing with their baby, 10 weeks of creative play with their baby, or 10 weeks of care as normal. Analysis revealed that, among women with moderate to severe symptoms of PND, group singing led to significantly faster reductions in symptoms of PND than either creative play or care as normal.<sup>\[1\]</sup> In\-depth qualitative research showed that group singing provides an authentic, social, and multicultural creative experience, calms babies, provides immersive ‘me time’ for mothers, facilitates a sense of achievement and identity, and can enhance perceived mother\-infant bonding.<sup>\[2\]</sup> Additionally, the singing workshops led to changes in maternal singing behaviours; women who had attended the singing workshops were significantly more likely to sing to their baby on a daily basis, were significantly more confident in singing, and had a significant increase in the number of songs they knew to sing to their babies compared with the control group.<sup>\[3\]</sup> 

 A set of further studies complemented and contextualized the main RCT. The first focused on the music facilitators who were recruited and trained by the RCM to run the singing and creative play groups in the RCT. A qualitative study with these facilitators evidenced the specific practices necessary to run workshops successfully, including a balance of forward\-planning with the need to retain flexibility and to provide women with autonomy and opportunities for bonding with each other and their babies. Key challenges included coping with the emotional nature of the work. A strong sense of team, the progressive rather than one\-off nature of the sessions, and the use of appropriate spaces supported the facilitators in their role.<sup>\[4\]</sup> The second focused on why singing in particular supports maternal mental health. A within\-subjects experiment comparing group singing with group play showed that singing is associated with greater increases in maternal perceptions of emotional closeness than other social interactions. Mother–infant singing is also associated with greater increases in positive affect and greater decreases in negative affect, as well as greater decreases in both psychological and biological markers of anxiety.<sup>\[5\]</sup> The third was an England\-wide survey involving over 2,500 pregnant women and new mothers, in order to understand the wider context of their music use. Findings demonstrated that there are associations between singing to a baby and lower symptoms of postnatal depression, enhanced wellbeing, self\-esteem, and perceived mother\-infant bonding,<sup>\[6\]</sup> suggesting that singing to babies at home, or outside of formal settings, may also be beneficial to maternal mental health.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Impacts on the health and wellbeing of people: outcomes for women** 

 As a direct result of the research, a new evidence\-based lifestyle intervention has been established for women with symptoms of postnatal depression. The 10\-week programme that was designed and tested in the original RCM research was implemented in 2017 as an ongoing service – *Melodies for Mums* – by Breathe Arts Health Research, a social enterprise spin\-out of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Charity. The research led to the formation of this service, as explained by Breathe’s interim director \(2019\): “Our *Melodies for Mums* service came about directly as a result of the Music and Motherhood research; it would not have happened without it. The research study has both informed how we deliver the programme \(in that we closely follow the study’s 10 week course structure, style and screening process\) and been the basis on which we’ve been able to fund the service; individuals, the NHS and a large grant funder have all supported the programme financially because we have evidence from the RCM study that the programme is effective”. To date, £282,309 of funding has been secured for delivery of *Melodies for Mums* on the basis of the research. 300 women have benefitted with a further 620 set to benefit in the next two and a half years \(with the roll\-out delayed in 2020 due to COVID\-19\).<sup>\[1\]</sup>  Women participating in the *Melodies for Mums* programme report that it supports their recovery, for example: ”I remember the first *Melodies for Mums* that I went to and it made me cry because I just felt quite invisible at that point and quite useless, and I think that having something that I could do with her \[my baby\] made a real difference. It was something to look forward to every week, and things started to get better. The feeding got better and she started to put on weight…and I think it was a turning point for me”.<sup>\[2\]</sup> 

 **Impacts on practitioners and the delivery of professional services: music and health practitioners** 

 For music practitioners, the research has provided evidence to underpin and support the development and continuation of singing groups for new mothers. For example, the Bristol\-based Folks & Bairns Choir, London/Sheffield based Pram Chorus, London\-based Big Red Bus Club, and UK\-wide Music Bus all cite the research in their marketing materials, using it to develop and justify programmes, to attract participants, and to publicize the mental health benefits of singing.<sup>\[3\]</sup> The research has also supported continued professional development for both musicians and health professionals. In March 2019, the research formed the basis for a Thinktank hosted by Snape Maltings, where music practitioners worked alongside researchers and health professionals to consider how to develop their own use of music with mothers and families. Outcomes included a residency to develop training for practitioners wanting to deliver this work and a proposal to funders to upscale the *Melodies for Mums* programme \(subsequently granted\).<sup>\[4\]</sup> A music practitioner and one of the thinktank participants, commented \(2019\): “The Music and Motherhood research has contributed significantly to my professional development and direction over the past two years. Whilst I've worked with parents and young children for many years, it helped me to 'connect the dots', and gave greater depth and meaning to what I do. I regularly reference this research when either writing funding applications, or advocating the work I do, as being foundational to the projects that I design and lead”. 

 For healthcare practitioners, the research has been used to raise awareness of the role of music in maternal healthcare. For example, the evidence of music’s effectiveness was featured at the Central and North West London Trust Learning Round in November 2018, as well as at the Psychological Medicine Clinical Network Perinatal Mental Health Stream in September 2020, with participants describing the input as “interesting”, “informative”, and “relevant”. A thinktank participant and perinatal healthcare practitioner from South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation commented \(2020\): “Experiencing first\-hand the discussion and practical session offered enabled me to confirm my knowledge around the importance of music and the mental health benefits to women. Music has always been a part of interventions in my work over the years, and having this research and knowledge as a practitioner is empowering to build on the knowledge and confidence as a tool to promote positive wellbeing, throughout some of the most difficult times as a new mum and parent"". 

 **Impacts on public policy** 

 The research has contributed to key policy documents which have established the evidence and need for the role of the arts in healthcare. For example, it was cited in the World Health Organization \(WHO, 2019\) scoping review on the role of the arts in improving health and wellbeing which “in light of the size of the evidence base mapped…raises a number of policy considerations for members of the WHO European Region to support the development of long\-term policies or strategies that will provide more synergized collaboration between health and arts sectors that could realize the potential of the arts for improving global health” \(p.57\). Further, it was listed in the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Arts, Health, and Wellbeing 2017 Creative Health report as evidence for the recommendation that “local authorities might ensure that health visitors, midwives, GPs and antenatal teachers are informed of the health and wellbeing benefits of arts participation for expectant mothers and those with pre\-school and school\-age children, and that these benefits are communicated to expectant and new mothers. Where there is little or no provision, local authorities might encourage partnership projects with local arts organisations” \(p.86\) and was cited in the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Arts, Health, and Wellbeing Submission to the Arts Council Strategy Consultation \(2019\) as “just one example of the enormous potential the arts has shown” in supporting maternal health.<sup>\[5\]</sup> Additionally, the research has been cited in public\-facing discussions as evidence for the importance of the rapidly expanding social prescribing movement in the UK.<sup>\[</sup><sup>6</sup><sup>\]</sup> 

 The research was featured in the *Tomorrow’s Child* *Exhibition* at the Houses of Parliament, 26 June–1 July 2016: ""This was a powerful showcase of mixed media art and science that ignited a lively and informed dialogue amongst participants and the 4,000 politicians and staff, generating greater awareness of the importance of the conception to age two period with an overwhelmingly positive response”.<sup>\[</sup><sup>7</sup><sup>\]</sup> The Mayor of London City Hall blog also cites *Melodies for Mums* and the “pioneering research” as “one of the programmes that inspired us as we researched how arts and culture can positively affect mental health and wellbeing”.<sup>\[</sup><sup>8</sup><sup>\]</sup> Finally, the research has underpinned health policy via stakeholders. A consultant perinatal psychiatrist at St Mary’s Hospital, London, commented \(2019\): “The research Music and Motherhood \[MM\] has had a profound impact on the newly established perinatal mental health services \[PMHS\], and as clinical lead of one of the largest services, I will ensure that the outcomes of the research will shape the future development of the PMHS in the context of the 10\-year NHS plan. The current services target specifically women with severe acute or enduring mental illness providing assessment, psychosocial and pharmacological interventions. However, there are limited provisions to promote the recovery after discharge from specialist services and to maintain well the large proportion of women with mild to moderate degree of illness who do not meet criteria to access secondary specialist services. The research of MM indicates that this gap in provisions can be filled by participatory music\-based initiatives”. 

 **Impacts on understanding, learning and participation: Public awareness** 

 Public awareness of the role of singing in maternal mental health has been raised via extensive media coverage of the research. In January 2018 the research was featured in 99 news outlets around the world, including in the UK, Europe, Asia, and North America,<sup>\[</sup><sup>9</sup><sup>\]</sup> resulting in over 14,500 engagements. The research was also featured as a ‘Top 100 breakthrough’ by MadeAtUni, a campaign to bring to life the impact of universities on people, lives, and communities. After its opening at the Houses of Parliament, the *Tomorrow’s Child Exhibition* toured to Oxford, Brighton, and London,<sup>\[</sup><sup>7</sup><sup>\]</sup> with the exhibition Director commenting \(2019\): ""\[We had\] lots of visitors and very good feedback…Pretty much everyone said it made them think differently about the 1001 days period, definitely raised awareness, even prompted changes in behaviour. One lady and her brother came three times from quite a distance to see it over the weekend as it had such an impact on them and said it helped them to understand their childhood\! Everyone said it was inspiring”. Finally, in 2019 the research featured on BBC2 Trust Me I’m a Doctor \(Series 8 Episode 4\) as part of a broadcast to 1.27 million people focusing on the “health evidence you can really trust”: “the study gives new insight into how singing can help you recover from postnatal depression…as the mums in this group have shown, finding the right support or treatment can lead to a full recovery”.<sup>\[</sup><sup>10\]</sup>

Mother–infant bonding among humans is not only linked with the infant’s survival but also with a range of protective psychological, biological, and behavioral responses in both mothers and infants in the post-birth period and across the life span. Anthropological theories suggest that one behavior that may have evolved with the aim of enhancing mother–infant bonding is infant-directed singing. However, to date, despite mother–infant singing being practiced across cultures, there remains little quantitative demonstration of any effects on mothers or their perceived closeness to their infants. This within-subjects study, comparing the effects of mother–infant singing with other mother–infant interactions among 43 mothers and their infants, shows that singing is associated with greater increases in maternal perceptions of emotional closeness in comparison to social interactions. Mother–infant singing is also associated with greater increases in positive affect and greater decreases in negative affect as well as greater decreases in both psychological and biological markers of anxiety. This supports previous findings about the effects of singing on closeness and social bonding in other populations.

However, studies tend to be limited by lack of comparison with other psychosocial interventions. This study builds on a three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) that demonstrated that group singing for mothers and babies, but not group creative play, can lead to faster recovery from moderate-severe symptoms of postnatal depression than usual care. The aim was to elucidate the mechanisms of the group singing intervention in order to account for its recovery properties.MethodsQualitative research was conducted with 54 mothers who had experienced symptoms of postnatal depression. Mothers completed a 10-week programme of either group singing or group creative play as part of the wider RCT study. Data were collected via a series of 10 semi-structured focus groups conducted at the end of each 10-week programme. These were designed to elicit subjective and constructed experiences of the singing and play interventions and were analysed inductively for emergent themes.ResultsFive distinctive features of the group singing emerged: (i) providing an authentic, social and multicultural creative experience, (ii) ability to calm babies; (iii) providing immersive ‘me time’ for mothers; (iv) facilitating a sense of achievement and identity; (v) enhancing mother-infant bond.ConclusionsCommunity group singing interventions may reduce symptoms of postnatal depression through facilitating a functional emotional response rooted in the needs of new motherhood. These features are of relevance to others seeking to implement creative interventions for maternal mental health.Trial registrationNCT02526407.

Ninety-three women up to 40 weeks post-birth with symptoms of PND were randomised to 10 weeks of group singing classes or usual care. Women who attended the singing workshops had a significantly greater increase than those in the control group in the frequency of their singing, their confidence in singing and the repertoire they knew. There were also indications that the partners of women in the singing group also increased their frequency of singing, suggesting effects can extend to the wider family unit. However, there was no impact on wider musical behaviours such as listening to music. This is the first demonstration that weekly singing programmes can alter musical behaviours in new mothers.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The bacterium Glaesserella parasuis \(formerly known as *Hemophilus parasuis\)* is one of the leading causes of pig mortality and morbidity worldwide. Catastrophic disease outbreaks can occur when pig populations with different variants of the pathogen are mixed. Research undertaken at the University of Cambridge led to a multiplex PCR test which substantially improves the ability to identify circulating variants. This allows more effective targeting of vaccination to control outbreaks and better\-informed pig flows to prevent spread and minimise the use of antibiotic treatment. It is being used by a US\-based pig producer that also operates in China and Mexico to inform management and vaccination strategies for their 365,000 sows. As secondary impact to the improvement in pig health, the test has generated commercial revenues of EUR 35,200 for a partner in Germany, and is also available as a diagnostic in Canada, China and the USA.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Globally, pig meat is the largest consumed individual animal protein: in 2019, 11.1 kg pig meat was consumed *per capita* globally \(source: Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development\).  This reality drives intensive pig farming practices. Intensification that increases herd population size and density supports the emergence and spread of infectious disease due to increased contact between animals. This enables pathogen transfer, which can disrupt finely balanced meat supply chains and allied industries, with potentially high animal mortality rates. *Glaesserella parasuis* is a bacterium found in the upper respiratory tract of swine that can cause severe systemic disease, primarily affecting young animals \(4–8 weeks old\). Endemic bacterial infections such as *G. parasuis* are prevalent throughout all pig supply chains and present a major challenge for pig health, welfare and for antibiotics stewardship. Outbreaks of *G. parasuis* have led to pig mortality rates of between 5\-10%, particularly in intense pig producing countries such as Canada, the USA, Europe, China and the Philippines. *G. parasuis* is classed into 15 different serotypes \(distinct variation within a species of bacteria or virus, which do not offer cross\-protective immunity\). Catastrophic disease outbreaks can occur when pig populations with divergent resident serotypes of the pathogen are mixed, or when replacement breeding stock are introduced. Knowing the serotype within a given herd allows introduction of commercial or autogenous bacterin vaccines \(vaccines created to target outbreak of a specific serotype of pathogen\) which provides protection within that serotype. Producers may further mitigate the risk of *G. parasuis* disease by using prophylactic antibiotics; this practice has been officially banned in the EU since 2018, so better ways to manage infection are important to establish. 

 **Distinguishing between serotypes of G. parasuis** 

 Researchers at the University of Cambridge built collaborations with established academic and commercial veterinary diagnostic bacteriologists in key pig producing countries – UK, Denmark, Spain, Germany, China, USA and Canada – enabling them to build a collection of pure colonies of previously serotyped isolates of *G. parasuis* for whole genome sequencing.  Research undertaken by Tucker, Maskell and Weinert in 2013 then analysed the whole genome sequences of these reference strains along with >100 field isolates to identify an extremely high level of association between the sequence of genes encoding enzymes responsible for bacterial cell wall synthesis \(capsule loci\) and the traditional serotyping results \(R1\). 

 Serotyping of *G. parasuis* previously relied on access to panels of reference strains and, by 2014, was available only in single laboratories in Germany, USA and Australia. The research conducted at Cambridge enabled them to develop a multiplex PCR in 2015, based on variations within the capsule loci, able to simultaneously detect multiple serovars of *G. parasuis* from a single clinical sample \(R2\). The multiplex PCR method has the advantage of being fast, simple, and transferable to molecular diagnostic laboratories with basic equipment, and it can be performed on crude DNA derived directly from bacterial colonies *.* 

 Since publication of the methodology for the multiplex PCR in 2015, testing has been instituted in commercial and research laboratories, improving differential diagnosis of *G. parasuis* serotypes, allowing better targeting of treatment, and minimising use of antibiotics while maintaining pig health.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 *G. parasuis* is endemic worldwide, but outbreaks in naïve populations can be catastrophic for the pig farming industry. For example, for one pig provider an outbreak resulted in more than 1200 high\-value pigs being lost in ten days, and four years on, the mortality doubled for pigs from weaning to market, in addition to the impact of the isolate entering downstream commercial flows \[E1\]. 

 The cost implications of this are substantial, as shown by an example cost calculation from the  [UK National Animal Disease Information Service](https://www.nadis.org.uk/disease-a-z/pigs/glaessers-disease/) of a typical *G. parasuis* outbreak. For a six\-week outbreak in a farm of 300 sows, they estimated a cost of GBP8000, with an ongoing vaccination cost of GBP6000 per year. Use of Cambridge University research has improved diagnosis of this disease, allowing better targeting of treatment, minimising use of antibiotics and reducing costs such as these for producers. 

 **Impact on disease diagnosis** 

 Since publication of the methodology for the multiplex PCR in 2015, testing has been instituted in commercial and research laboratories. Currently the methodology is offered commercially in Germany \(IVD gmbh\), Canada \(University of Montreal Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory\) and the USA \(Iowa State University\). 

 IVD GmbH serves a population of 40,000 customers in 28 European countries, primarily in Germany and the Netherlands. The test has replaced their previous serological method, and, since its introduction in April 2017, has shown a rapid increase in tests, from just under 100 in 2017, to just under 300 in 2019. Approximately 880 different pig populations have been tested to date; at a charge of EUR40 per test, this equates to revenue of EUR35,200 for the company. A managing partner at IVD GmbH says: *“The development of this serotyping multiplex PCR is of great value for the veterinary diagnostic industry, as it is indeed for us…”* \[E2\] 

 In Canada, via the University of Montreal Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, the test has been used to serotype 452 strains since 2017, reducing the number of un\-typeable strains from almost 50% to 2%, thereby allowing practitioners to implement more effective vaccination strategies. The lab has also helped laboratories from Chile, Mexico and Colombia to use the test for research purposes, and also transferred the technique to Iowa State University, USA. The professor who heads the diagnostic service states that the test *“has been an incredible advancement in science and it has significantly helped the swine industry”*. \[E3\] 

 **Impact on pig health and welfare** 

 Rapid serovar identification using the multiplex *G. parasuis* PCR determines whether multiple virulent serovars or a mixture of virulent and avirulent serovars are present in a sample. This knowledge allows earlier introduction of prophylactic vaccination, or strategies that prevent the mixing of ‘pig flows’ with incompatible serotype profiles; both approaches minimise the use of antibiotics while maintaining pig health. 

 For the past four years Tucker has used his expertise to provide technical advice to Genus plc’s Pig Improvement Company \(PIC\) in the capacity of Adviser for Global Health Assurance. PIC specialises in the genetic improvement of pigs, and has more than 300 units around the world; they lead the market with a share of 24% and are the only listed porcine genetics company \(Genus,  [About Us](https://www.genusplc.com/about-us/our-market/)\). Their units are supplied from an elite gene pool held at nucleus units in Canada and the USA; more than 120 million slaughter pigs each year contain PIC genetics. Innovations that support achieving the highest possible health status are important in enabling rapid, unhindered dissemination of genetics around the world but also, once the pigs are on\-farm, in enabling pigs to grow in line with genetic potential and ensure efficiency of resources. 

 Tucker worked with Genus PIC to implement the PCR test developed at Cambridge to support practical preventive medicine approaches at farm level. Genus PIC is currently employing the multiplex PCR to characterise the array of *G. parasuis* serotypes present in its key supply pyramids, with the goal of identifying those breeding herds carrying serotypes more frequently associated with disease \[E4\]. Given that the most severe disease outbreaks arise when pigs are exposed to strains of *G. parasuis* to which they have no prior exposure or immunity, this has enabled a more preventive approach to matching sources when mixing of piglets from multiple farms is unavoidable within the PIC production pyramids. It also supports better matching of supply farm to customer farm to minimise outbreaks of disease after the sale of replacement breeding stock. Genus PIC is also now coordinating an unprecedented analysis of more than 600 isolates of *G. parasuis* from around the world to determine which serotypes are most strongly associated with disease in the key pig producing countries, thereby informing the design of more relevant vaccines in future. 

 A Technical Services Specialist for Genus PIC states \[E4\] that the multiplex PCR tool developed by Maskell and Tucker has been highly valuable for a breeding stock company such as PIC for the following reasons: 

1.  It improves/supports source selection decisions, 

1.  Allows them to identify proper vaccine candidates 

1.  Enables them  to refine pig movements; and 

1.  Allows them to identify sources of new introductions of infection 

 Their use of the test was presented at the American Association of Swine Veterinarians conference 2019, referencing R2. The presentation described that these “rapid and reliable tools can be useful for pathogen surveillance, identification of appropriate autogenous vaccine candidates, to improve pig flow management by commingling sources with the same serotype and to prevent introduction of pigs with potentially virulent HPS strains”. \[E5\] 

 Another major pig producer, Pipestone \(USA\) manages 280,000 sows in the US, 60,000 sows in China and 25,000 sows in Mexico. Their Health Assurance Director says that they have found “tremendous value” from the Cambridge work on *G. parasuis*. They have used the multiplex PCR test to screen during clinical outbreaks, and confirm presence of specific serotypes to decide gilt \(young female pig yet to have a litter\) flow changes. The tool has also been used to select isolates for autogenous vaccines, and to measure the efficacy of control strategies on specific *G. parasuis* serotypes. The Cambridge test allowed them to take more accurate and opportune decisions on gilt sourcing, preventing considerable outbreaks or instability that would have needed high antibiotic use. They have been able to implement a more strategic use of antibiotics \(timing, class, route\), and a more accurate selection of commercial or autogenous vaccines \[E1\]. 

 Disease and mortality from *G. parasuis* infection is a significant issue for the pig farming industry, and by consequence, for the food supply chain and cost of protein that plays a key role in nutrition. The test developed based on research from the University of Cambridge is recognised as an important progression in tackling this pathogen \[E6, R1 and R2 referenced page 3\], generating revenue for diagnostic services, improving pig management and enabling more effective vaccination and antibiotic use strategies.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Mega sport events, such as the Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup, have significant long\-term effects on host nations. Therefore, embracing sustainable development is crucial. Research by Edinburgh Napier University \(ENU\) evaluated the effects of contemporary mega sport events, as well as the role of key stakeholders in ensuring sustainable event legacies. The research findings informed the direction of UNESCO’s 2017 Action Plan in mega sport event policy. This led to sport ministers from 97 states committing to using mega sport events for infrastructure improvements, sustainable tourism and behavioural change campaigns. Ministers and organisers also took steps to foster transparency, good governance, and rigour in evaluation of mega sport event effects.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Mega sport events can have both positive and negative long\-term effects on host nations. The issue of legacy is widely documented in academic literature and the media, and remains a topic of debate. Balancing rapid development of event infrastructure, whilst encouraging long\-term sustainable social benefits is a familiar tension. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of comprehensive evaluation of mega sport events as a holistic concept. Existing studies predominantly concern the effects in particular periods, in defined geographical settings, or to isolated sectors in society. The roles of stakeholders in the production of long\-term sustainable effects are also under\-researched. This previously limited understanding has led to missed opportunities for sustainable development via mega sport events, and worse, has contributed to planning mistakes and undesirable legacies. 

 This research sought to create significant and transnationally relevant impact from findings. As such, the studies gathered evidence from a range of events across a number of countries. The research reported here investigated these events in Greece **\[O1\]** the European Union area **\[O2\]** Qatar and Bahrain **\[O3, P2\]**, Italy **\[O4\]**, Germany **\[O5\]** and internationally **\[P1, O6\]**. The research was undertaken at ENU, in collaboration with colleagues in other institutions. Multidisciplinary, international research involved collaborations with Dr. Mahfoud Amara, Dr. Dan Musinguzi and Dr. Girish Nair in Qatar, Professors Laura Michelini and Genaro Iasevoli in Italy, Dr Sarah Snell in England and Ms Claire den Hertog in the Netherlands. The two principle aims of the research were: 

1.  **To map the impact evaluation practices of event stakeholders.** 

 Dr Theodoraki acted as consultant to the Athens Organising Committee for the 2004 Olympic Games. In 2009, she analysed official communications from the bid and organising committees, to understand how they evaluated and disseminated the long\-term effects of this event **\[O1\]**. The research observed that the institutional structure behind the bid and host committees had great influence on its communication of long\-term impacts. Obligations on behalf of the organising committees to the host nation and International Olympic Committee \(IOC\) also shaped communication efforts and influenced the legacy evaluation frameworks that were later employed. 

 In 2012, Dr Theodoraki analysed the effectiveness of indicators used to evaluate the economic impacts of pre\-Olympic and pre\-Commonwealth Games training visits to host cities **\[P1\]**. This revealed a plethora of different approaches to evaluation of long\-term effects beyond the standard economic indicators and informed the research project funder on the potential of the Commonwealth Games to create economic impact in the pre\-event stage. Following this, a similar study explored legacy evaluations of European City of Culture \(ECoC\) events **\[O2\]**. The research analysed evaluation documentation from events between 1985\-2015, to illustrate the evolving character of evaluation from the different stakeholder perspectives. The findings revealed how methodologies are increasingly redefined and standardised over time by stakeholders, for greater rigour in evaluation. The work also captured an increase in requests for incorporating legacy plans in event bids, to improve positive long\-term effects and avoid negative ones. 

1.  **To explore the relationship between stakeholders, events, and long\-term impacts** 

 Research led by Dr Amara \(Qatar University\), with Dr Theodoraki, sought to explore how sports related projects such as the Doha Asian Games and Bahrain Formula 1 have led to regional development in the Arabian Peninsula **\[O3\]**. It identified the use of sporting values for increased brand awareness, the connection of global and local activity of stakeholders, and the role of royal families as key to the success of the overall operating network. 

 In 2013, Dr Theodoraki evaluated stakeholders’ perceptions of the potential and challenges to ensuring social behaviour change via the upcoming Qatar FIFA 2022 World Cup **\[P2\]**. The research found that there is high potential for social improvement in rapidly emerging professional localities. In anticipation of the event, stakeholders have high expectations for social improvement, but challenges have also been experienced by those who face conflicting priorities. In particular, the tension between meeting existing policy targets, and the event requirements, versus long\-term legacy goals has created barriers. The relationship between large scale events and business outcomes was further explored in research led by Professors Michelini and Iasevoli \(LUMSA University in Rome\), with Dr Theodoraki **\[O4\]**. This focused on the Rome International Film Festival and measured whether attendee venue satisfaction had an impact on sponsorship outcomes, such as recall and purchase intention. Attitudes to sponsors were found to be influenced by venue satisfaction, and the authors also developed a new model of event sponsorship evaluation that considered the role of attendee venue satisfaction. 

 In 2018, the research team at ENU explored the impact potential of commemorative events on host cities **\[O5\]**. Using the example of the 20<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> anniversaries of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the research explored the role of these events in encouraging ‘event tourism’. The study concluded that such iconic\-historic events should be recognised as significant contributors to tourism and host economies. In 2020, ENU award winning research explored how coherent brands can be successfully co\-created by multiple stakeholders **\[O6\]**. Subsequently, the Olympic Games was used for context as an event with multiple stakeholders and a strong brand identity, in order to understand problems, solutions, and best practice for brand managers. It found that brands like the Olympic Games are best managed via negotiation between competing stakeholders, and by utilizing a number of online and offline engagement platforms. This also emphasises the role of stakeholder networks in understanding long\-term effects of mega sport events.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research by ENU led to a clearer understanding of previous mega sport event planning and evaluation practices. It highlighted important and successful examples, as well as recognising the vital role played by networks of stakeholders in legacy planning. It also applied key findings to potential future plans to further improve sustainable social development. 

 Identified findings directly impacted **public policy.** The international scope of the findings, and close engagement with UNESCO, \[text removed for publication\], ministries and public sector organisations, led to implementation of policies, systems and reforms at a number of levels of sports governance. Main beneficiaries were; UNESCO and sports ministries in UNESCO member states, \[text removed for publication\], organising committees of mega sports events in the UK, public sector organisations in China, the Qatar Ministry of Public Health, and the Qatar Olympic Academy. The **indicators of reach and significance of impact on public policy** are found in: a\) acknowledgements in UNESCO reports **\[C1, C2\]**, and b\) evidence of influence on debate in public policy and practice through distinctive contributions to expert panels and advice to government \(at local, national or international level\). **\[C3, C4, C5, C6, C9, C10\]**. The research has also led to awards and notable media recognition **\[C7, C8\]**. 

 **Impact on International Sport Policy Development** 

 International sport policy development has been influenced by research findings on event evaluation practices **\[O1, O2, O3\].** Findings on best planning and evaluation practice informed the UNESCO\-led sport ministers 2017 Action Plan on managing the long\-term effects of sport events, and the role of these events in sustainable development. The Ministers meeting at the Sixth International Conference of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport \(MINEPS VI\), held in Kazan \(13\-15 July 2017\) expressed their *‘gratitude to all involved experts \[Dr Theodoraki\] for their commitment and contributions.’* **\[C1\].** Ministers also confirmed that: *‘the consultations with the three expert Working Groups, as well as the establishment of a virtual working space for the working groups, made possible the further development of the sport policy follow\-up framework’* **\[C1\]** *.* 

 Dr Theodoraki also participated as expert at the UNESCO event on Match Fixing and Corruption in Sport, Doha, Qatar in September 2015. She articulated a report she had authored on event assessment for Transparency International **\[C3\],** drawing on previous research findings **\[O1, O2, O3\]**. At the event, she brought awareness to international government representatives on the problem of mega sport event mega assessment **\[C2\]**. This supported the development of a network of policy agents committed to address the weaknesses on event evaluation and governance frameworks. UNESCO noted afterwards ‘ *We should also like to express our gratitude to the speakers and experts \[Dr Theodoraki\] attending the meeting. The interest that they showed throughout both days of the meeting, together with their expert opinions, fuelled the discussion and highlight the various key measures in the fight against manipulation of sports competitions.’* **\[C2\]**.

 **Impact on Sustainability Assurance of Mega Sport Events in the UK** 

 The research informed an assurance policy for sustainable events which was implemented for the London 2012 Olympic Games. This has led to a more sustainable legacy from the games through to present day. Dr Theodoraki was a core\-commissioner member of the Commission for a Sustainable London 2012. Her research on mega sport events **\[O1, O3, P1\]** informed the commission’s: a\) recommendations to organisers and government departments and b\) evaluations of their Olympic Games related sustainability plans. Based on the commission’s recommendations, organisers took remedial action, and guidance was issued to the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee. In all,  [fourteen reports](https://cslondon.org/publications/index7a81.html?category=1) were published by the Commission. 

 The Independent evaluation of the Commission for a Sustainable London 2012 acknowledged that *‘\[Theodoraki\] had very significant expertise in the area of events’ assurance and the events’ industry.’* and also noted *‘CSL 2012 added greatly to the credibility of London 2012 and should be a model for future Olympics and other mega sporting events, like the Commonwealth Games, FIFA World Cup and Rugby World Cup’* **\[C5\]**. Ex\-Mayor of London, and current UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on the role of providing expertise on the sustainability of the London Olympic Games, noted ‘ *By being at the forefront of public commentary and assurance of the 2012 programme, you \[Dr Theodoraki\] have maintained a spotlight on London’s commitments and on our delivery against these. Your personal contribution to the Commission has been substantial, providing expertise in the area of event management and I commend you for your intellectual commitment, and for giving up your personal time in this endeavour.’* **\[C6\]**. 

 **Impact on CPD in Ministries and Sport Organisations in Qatar and China** 

 The research findings on leveraging the FIFA 2022 World Cup for social behaviour change **\[P2\]** and on the impacts of various mega sport events and large\-scale cultural events **\[P1, O1\-O6\]** were widely covered in the media **\[C8\].** This led to professional development and research dissemination programmes in Doha, in 2017, 2018 and 2019, hosted by the Qatar Olympic Academy. Approximately 20 participants attended each year from National Olympic Committees and National sport federations in Qatar, Yemen, Oman, UAE and Saudi Arabia. The Qatar Olympic Academy then acknowledged Dr Theodoraki *‘in recognition of outstanding contribution and service to sports and athletes in the state of Qatar.’* **\[C7\]**. 

 In 2019, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Municipality of Chengdu in China requested Dr Theodoraki to deliver professional development sessions to delegations of senior event managers. She was requested to cover her research to provide advice on the potential for social leveraging of forthcoming mega sport events hosted in China **\[C9\]**. \[text removed for publication\]

Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative methodology, the paper provides a tentative framework of co-created Olympic brand meanings by exploring the narratives of stakeholders’ brand experiences of the brand. Sixteen semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of Olympic stakeholders were conducted and analysed to identify key meanings associated with the Olympic brand.   Findings Through their transformational and social experiences of the Olympic brand, stakeholders co-create brand meanings based on Olympic values of excellence, friendship and respect. However, at the same time, they offer their own interpretations and narratives related to competing meanings of spectacle, exclusion and deceit. Alternative brand touchpoints were identified, including blogs; fan and sports community forums; educational and academic sources; and historical sources and literature.   Practical implications The brand manager must become a brand negotiator, facilitating multi-stakeholder co-creation experiences on a variety of online and offline engagement platforms, and exploring how alternative brand touchpoints can be used to access co-created brand meanings.   Originality/value The study contributes to tourism branding literature by providing exploratory evidence of how brand meanings are co-created in the relatively under-researched multi-stakeholder sports mega-event context.

which the bid and then the organising committee of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games (OG) assessed and communicated the event’s intended and achieved impacts to various audiences during the respective organisational lifecycles. It draws on data on impacts that have been reported from the two committees, and comments on the timing of their communication, the themes under which impacts have been reported, the rationale for these communication activities and the selectivity of the evalaution indicators used. Relevant literature that allows the consideration of organisational communication activity as seeking to create certain meaning(s) as well as brand management literature has aided the interpretation of the findings, and the communication on impacts of the Athens 2004 OG is seen to be part of the image building exercises undertaken. The analysis also identifies how institutional and contractual obligations of the bid committee and the organising committee at different points in time affected the conceptualisation and communication of impact data and reports. The creation of an overall impact evaluation framework named Olympic Games Global Impact (OGGI) by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its implementation in the case of the Athens 2004 OG is discussed as a failed attempt to obtain a longitudinal overview of impact. Keywords: mega‐event; evaluation; communication; conceptualisation Abstract El propósito de este trabajo es evaluar las formas en las que el comité de licitación y el comité organizador (CO) de los Juegos Olímpicos (JJ.OO.) de Atenas 2004 valoraron y se comunicaron sobre los impactos perseguidos y los alcanzados en diversas audiencias durante los respectivos ciclos de vida organizativos. Se recurre a datos sobre los impactos que han sido proporcionados por los dos comités y a comentarios sobre el ritmo de sus comunicaciones, los temas en los que se informaba de dichos impactos, la racionalidad de las actividades de comunicación y la selectividad de los indicadores de evaluación utilizados. Literatura relevante que permite la consideración de la actividad de comunicación organizacional como un intento de crear cierto significado así como la literatura de gestión de marca se han añadido a la interpretación de los resultados y la comunicación de los impactos de los JJ.OO. Atenas 2004 que se ven como un aparte de los ejercicios de construcción de imagen desarrollados. Este análisis también identifica como las obligaciones institucionales y contractuales del comité de licitación y el comité de organización en diferentes momentos del tiempo afectan a la conceptuación y comunicación de los informes y los datos sobre impactos. También se discute la creación de un marco de evaluación global de los impactos denominado Impacto Global de los Juegos Olímpicos (Olympic Games Global Impact – OGGI) y su implantación en el caso de Atenas 2004 como un intento fallido de obtener una visión longitudinal del impacto. Keywords: mega‐evento; evaluación; comunicación; conceptuación Résumé Cet article a pour objectif d’évaluer la façon dont le comité d’organisation (CO) des jeux olympiques (JO) d’Athènes de 2004, l’examen de la soumission du contrat d’organisation et la diffusion de cet événement ont eu les impacts escomptés sur différentes audiences à différentes étapes respectives d’organisation. Il s’appuie sur les données disponibles sur les impacts recueillis par les deux comités, ainsi que sur les commentaires concernant le timing de leur communication, les thèmes sous lesquels les impacts ont été relevés, les raisons pour lesquelles ces activités d’information et le choix des indicateurs d’évaluation qui ont été utilisés. Les données pertinentes qui permettent de considérer l’activité informationnelle de l’organisation en essayant d’éclairer certains points et le discours du marketing de l’événement qui ont facilité l’interprétation des résultats et l’information sur les impacts des JO d’Athènes de 2004 semblent faire partie intégrante des exercices entrepris pour créer l’image de marque. Cette analyse identifie également la manière dont les obligations institutionnelles et contractuelles du comité chargé des soumissions ainsi que du comité d’organisation à différents points à travers le temps a affecté la conceptualisation et l’identification de l’impact des données et des rapports. La création, par le Comité International Olympique (CIO), du cadre global d’évaluation de l’impact, nommé Impact Global des Jeux Olympiques (IGJO), et sa mise en application dans le cas des JO fait aussi l’objet de débats comme étant une vaine tentative d’obtenir un aperçu longitudinal de l’impact.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Eleni', 'last_name': 'Theodoraki', 'initials': None, 'researcher_id': 'ur.0732252715.04', 'grid_ids': array([], dtype=object), 'orcid': array([], dtype=object), 'corresponding': True, 'raw_affiliations': array(['Edinburgh Napier Business School, Craiglockhart, Edinburgh, EH14 1DJ, UK'],\n       dtype=object), 'affiliations_address': array([{'grid_id': None, 'city_id': 2650225, 'state_code': None, 'country_code': 'GB', 'raw_affiliation': 'Edinburgh Napier Business School, Craiglockhart, Edinburgh, EH14 1DJ, UK'}],\n       dtype=object)}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ]"", 'Funding': '[]', 'Concepts,': '[]', 'L1_ANZSRC_FoR': ['Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services', 'Human Society'], 'L2_ANZSRC_FoR': ['Tourism', 'Policy and Administration', 'Political Science']}, 'Research_2': {'dimensions_id': 'pub.1105125073', 'title_preferred': 'The role of iconic-historic commemorative events in event tourism: Insights from the 20th and 25th anniversaries of the fall of the Berlin Wall', 'doi': '10.1016/j.tourman.2018.06.018', 'issn': '0261-5177', 'eissn': '1879-3193', 'type': 'article', 'date': Timestamp('2018-12-01 00:00:00'), 'journal': 'Tourism Management', 'Times Cited': 21, 'Recent Citations': 8, 'Field Citation Ratio': 8, 'Relative Citation Ratio': 0, 'Altmetric': 2, 'Abstract': ""{'preferred': ' The role of commemorative events for event tourism has received marginal attention.

<p>Members of the PHC at Loughborough University engaged in strategic, high profile capacity building in parasport. This resulted in the establishment of new sports at the Paralympics and Commonwealth Games, including Paracanoe at the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics and Wheelchair Basketball at the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Their research informed the implementation of healthcare and practical advice for organisers, coaches, and athletes. For example, the International Triathlon Union changed their regulations concerning wetsuit use in 2019 to account for added strain when wearing a wetsuit in high water temperatures.

<h6>Anti-Match Fixing: Improving Global Sports Governance and Bringing Perpetrators to Account. </h6>
<p>Previously, physical evidence was required to prosecute match fixing cases. ICS research helped have this requirement removed, allowing the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to rule that evidence from betting markets was sufficient to identify match fixing. Following this ruling, FIFA ordered the replay of a match in which the referee was found to be involved in match-fixing. This was the replay that enabled Senegal to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. ICS research has also underpinned the education of athletes and coaches on match-fixing. A follow-up project, ERASMUS+, saw Liverpool partner with EU Athletes to introduce whistle-blowing apps for 3,000 athletes in 7 countries across a range of sports.

<h6>Changing masculinities and enhancing safety in sport. </h6>
<p>Collaboration to establish LGBT+ Research in Sport Network with Sport England. Textbooks by ICS researchers have been adopted in UK universities. Oxford Brookes, Wolverhampton, Durham, and Southampton Solent now feature teaching on inclusive masculinities on sport-related and gender/sexuality-related courses. Anderson was one of the founders of the Sport Collision Injury Collective (SCIS), a multidisciplinary collective of academics highlighting injuries sustained in youth sport participation. The group published an open letter ‘Preventing injuries in children playing school rugby’ which petitioned to make contact sports non-compulsory. The SCIS website has received 900,000,000 hits, and the letter itself was printed in major print and online newspapers (e.g., The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Independent). New regulations regarding tackling in children’s rugby and banning heading in football for children under 12 have resulted.

<h6>Defining the autonomy and specificity of sport in EU law: Shaping the adoption of globally applicable football agent regulations and the EU’s approach to nationality-based eligibility rules in European sport.</h6>
<p>Most impact resulted from informing various EU commissions on regulating sports discrimination. Parrish’s work on nationality discrimination in sport has helped alter the EU’s approach to this issue whilst setting the boundaries for sports bodies on questions of nationality-based eligibility rules. Related commissions created change of nationality-based eligibility regulations of 26 Olympic sports across all 27 Member States of the EU, identifying that the widespread sporting practice of denying access to sporting competitions on account of nationality was in conflict with EU law regarding non-discrimination of nationality in economic matters. Judgements informed by this research protect athletes from discriminatory nationality measures adopted by both states and private bodies, such as sporting entities, under EU citizenship rights regardless of the level of economic activity (e.g., if the athlete is an amateur). Research underpinned an enquiry into nationality in European team sport launched by the European Commission in 2012, which challenged the legality of UEFA’s home-grown player rule (introduced in 2006/7). This challenge argued that the rule created indirect discrimination on the grounds of nationality.

<h6>Enhancing practice and improving outcomes of career transition support services in elite sport</h6>
<p>Introduction of mental health and practice support for professional athletes transitioning into non-sporting roles at the end of their competitive careers. This work has increased issue awareness in professional organisations and led to constructive outcomes. The England Rugby Players Association has introduced 8 development managers and 1 transition manager to support over 800 current and 400 former players across premiership clubs. These reforms became particularly significant during the Covid-19 pandemic, when team sports were heavily impacted and early career transition became necessary. This research prompted campaigns by the English Institute of Sport (#More2Me) and the International Federation of Professional Footballers Associations (FIFPro) to use the finding to encourage athletes to recognise the benefits of planning for life after sport. #More2Me was publicly backed by both the Minister for Sport and the Chair of UK Sport.

<h6>Football4Peace (F4P): Building bridges in divided, unequal and unjust societies</h6>
<p>University of Brighton research led to the creation of Football4Peace (F4P) which uses values-based coaching methodology and delivery to promote peace-building in divided and post-conflict societies. Early work in Northern Ireland, Israel and South Africa has been extended in The Gambia, Colombia and South Korea. Related NGOs have been formed to support and further this programme and its methodologies, including the formation of UNESCO clubs based on the Brighton F4P initiatives. The model has been applied to several other sports, and since 2014 has benefitted 532 coaches/volunteers, 4,699 young people, residents and pupils in 87 local communities in 7 major cities. F4P training in Columbia in partnership with Fundación Buen Punto enabled FBP to obtain international recognition through an award given by Peace and Sport in Rhodes, 2018.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research at the University of Cambridge was motivated by the need for an epidemiological toolkit to mitigate the impact of emerging epidemics that threaten crop plants and food security, as well as natural vegetation such as forest and woodland trees. The toolkit is sufficiently tested and suitably flexible to enable rapid and effective deployment to predict the rate of disease spread and cost\-effective intervention options as epidemics occur in real time. 

 The idea for the research was developed during a BBSRC Professorial Research Fellowship on *Disease in changing agricultural environments* awarded to Prof. Chris Gilligan at the University of Cambridge \(2004\-10\). This led to the development of a theoretical framework for plant disease epidemics spreading through heterogeneous landscapes. In 2008, Prof. Gilligan’s group assembled a series of flexible epidemiological models together with computational and statistical methods for parameter estimation, as well as economic and meteorological models, into an ‘epidemiological toolkit’ to deal with emerging epidemics of pathogens affecting crops, semi\-natural and natural vegetation \[R1, R2, R3\], which can have devastating consequences \[R3\]. The methods have been extensively tested in the same period using a range of pathogens \(including fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses\) and insect vectors, and extended to include insect pests. Fundamentally, these models track the infection/infestation status of individual sites using stochastic, spatially explicit epidemic models. A site may be an individual plant, a field, farm, village or other grouping and the models scale from what happens within individual fields and farms, through villages and districts up to whole countries and beyond to continental disease spread \[R1,R2\]. The basic formulation of the models is recognisable as a susceptible\-infected\-removed \(SIR\) compartmental model, familiar in medical epidemiology. The innovations come in the extensions of compartments to allow for multiple sources of infection \(trade, vector\) as well as distinguishing a range of infection classes \[R1, R2, R3, R4\]. These include cryptic classes that are infectious but not symptomatic and detectable classes that can only be identified by diagnostic methods \(visual, molecular, machine\-learning imaging of symptoms\). In this way it is possible, to predict the present status of disease, which is routinely unknown, as well as the future spread. The models are <ins>stochastic</ins> to allow for inherent variability of epidemic spread and other uncertainties, for example, knowledge of dispersal characteristics. Outputs therefore comprise probability distributions that allow estimation of spreading risk and identification and comparison of scenarios for epidemic control that have low risks of failure given the present states of knowledge \[R1, R2, R3, R4\]. 

 The models incorporate: 

-  *crop layers* \(to describe the density, connectivity and timing of target crops and, where appropriate, alternative hosts\); 

-  *environment layers* \(to describe changing weather variables; typically, these involve access to historic and forecast meteorological data\); 

-  *pest/vector layers* \(to describe the dispersal and transmission characteristics and yield impacts of target pests\); 

-  *grower\-activity layers* \(to reflect agronomic and grower behaviour, including deployment of control\). \[R5\] 

 Long\-distance spore dispersal typical of pathogens such as wheat rusts, which can survive and travel for multiple days in turbulent airflow and infect hosts hundreds to thousands of kilometres away, are modelled using meteorologically\-driven, Lagrangian dispersal models. These are adapted from UK Met Office models, notably Numerical Atmospheric\-dispersion Modelling Environment \(NAME\), which was originally used to model dispersal of radionuclides, ash clouds and non\-biological propagules. Adaptations for living spores and insects require allowance for death from UV radiation during turbulent wind dispersal. In work published in 2017, the dispersal models were coupled with meteorologically\-driven models incorporating criteria for infection. \[R5\] 

 Parameter estimation is an essential component of the toolkit with Bayesian methods including Markov chain Monte Carlo and Approximate Bayesian Computation, developed and optimised for use in extracting signals for dispersal characteristics from often heterogeneous and incomplete landscape\-scale surveillance data. All the models have been optimised to allow rapid computation of multiple stochastic simulations, as for example with the spread of a cassava disease vectored by insect and trade, resolved at 1 km resolution across 20 sub\-Saharan countries. \[R4\] 

 This body of research on epidemiological modelling has been implemented in four different contexts to generate positive impacts on the management of damaging plant diseases.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **1\) Forecasting wheat rust diseases in Ethiopia for smallholder farmers to enable timely action** 

 The models for spore dispersal of wheat rust have been used in 2015/16 to produce an early warning system \(EWS\) in Ethiopia, forecasting up to seven days in advance. Wheat is an important crop in the country, with 5.3M tonnes produced in 2019 \(Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN,  [crop data](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/)\). Deployment of the EWS was conducted in partnership with the Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency \(ATA\), the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research \(EIAR\), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre \(Ethiopia\), and the UK Met Office. It successfully provided timely information to assist policy makers \(EIAR, the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Resources \(MoALR\), Ethiopian ATA, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre \(CIMMYT\)\) to formulate decisions about allocation of limited fungicide stocks during the 2017 and 2018 seasons. Alerts and advisories were sent by SMS and reports to development agents and smallholder farmers, who rely on wheat for subsistence and livelihood security, enabling them to deploy fungicides to control the disease. The framework represents one of the first advanced crop disease EWSs implemented in a developing country \[E1\]. The Senior Program Officer for Agricultural Development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \(BMGF\), which has supported Prof. Gilligan’s work since 2012, describes the EWS as “innovative” and says that prior to its introduction “many growers had…suffered from significant loss”. \[E2\] 

 A statement from \[text removed for publication\], who co\-fund activity in this region, says that the EWS “is highly effective \[text removed for publication\] ” \[E3\] 

 **2\) Predicting the spread and options for control of cassava brown streak disease in East, Central and West Africa** 

 According to the West African Virus Epidemiology \(WAVE\) programme, cassava is a major staple food crop for an estimated 500M people in Sub\-Saharan Africa. Cassava brown streak virus \(CBSV\), a major threat to cassava production across the African continent, is spread by an insect vector and the movement of planting material through trade. There are currently no CBSV resistant varieties of cassava available \(E2\) and the virus can reduce yields by between 50\-100% \(UN FAO, Food Chain Crisis Early Warning Bulletin, 2018\). 

 As technical partners to WAVE, Prof. Gilligan’s group predicted the spread of CBSV through Central Africa, successfully identifying the location and timing of invasion into Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018\-19. WAVE has been implemented in ten countries \(Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, Togo and Sierra Leone\) with a combined population of 400 million \(World Bank, 2019 data\). The programme’s Executive Director says that Prof. Gilligan has been “instrumental in informing governments of the risks and in instituting surveillance programmes for early warning of the arrival of the pathogen…\[and\] undoubtedly influential in focussing governments to develop an integrated programme for surveillance, preparedness and response to the disease. This has influenced policies in all ten countries and would not have been possible without the scientific work of the Cambridge team”. \[E4\] In December 2018, government Ministers of Agriculture or Scientific Research from these countries signed response plans to cassava viral diseases, now being implemented with support from WAVE. The Senior Program Officer for Agricultural Development at BGMF states: “Predictions and models \[from\] the Cambridge team…have been instrumental tools in…mobilizing ministers…to support an integrated program. The models are integral to screening strategies for management of the disease.” \[E2\] 

 **3\) Strategy for the control of banana bunchy top virus for the Australian banana industry** 

 Banana bunchy top virus \(BBTV\) is regarded as one of the most significant disease threats to banana crop production. The disease kills the banana plant within a year and epidemics can lead to complete crop loss if unchecked \(CABI Invasive Species Compendium, Banana bunchy top virus data sheet 2019\). It is of major concern in Australia, with production in the principal growing region of Northern Queensland forming 70% of the country’s AUD605M industry. \[E5\] 

 In 2017\-18, at the request of Hort Innovation, a grower\-owned corporation for Australia's horticulture industry, the Gilligan group successfully developed and tested a model, comparing different scenarios for inspection and detection of disease. 

 The results showed that an intended change in strategy, switching reliance from trained personnel to growers, would risk a significant build\-up of disease in Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales, where it is endemic. This would negatively affect production in those areas, but also create a greater source of risk for spread into Northern Queensland. The Research and Development Manager at Hort Innovation says the modelling “was clearly explained by Prof. Gilligan and…was undoubtedly instrumental in changing practice, \[and\] setting targets for surveillance and management to reduce the risk of further spread of the disease.” \[E5\] 

 **4\) Surveillance and management strategies for risks to UK woodland trees and citrus trees in the US** 

 Prof. Gilligan previously chaired a UK taskforce on plant disease, and subsequently his group was awarded a competitive commission by Defra to provide the UK Government with a standing capacity for modelling support to inform responses to and preparations for invasions and spread of plant pest and pathogens, from 2016 to 2019. The Chief Plant Health Officer at Defra says that the group has “made a vital contribution to supporting plant health in the UK between 2013 and 2020” and has “enabled Defra to lead the way in the use of epidemiological models and predictions to communicate risk and compare strategies for management of tree disease with stakeholders” \[E6\]. Specific examples of this are: 

 **a. Dieback disease of ash \( **Hymenoscyphus fraxineus**\)** 

 There are approximately 185 million ash trees in the UK, fulfilling important roles in supporting biodiversity and ecological functions, which no single alternative UK native tree species can provide. Defra estimates the social and environmental value of ash at over GBP230 million per year, and The Woodland Trust estimates that dieback will kill around 80% of ash trees across the UK without intervention. The work of the Cambridge group successfully demonstrated that, contrary to current opinion, importation of infected trees for planting was not the only source of infection. Their models were used to inform ministerial decisions on strategies such as the imposition of an import ban for the management of the disease. \[E6\] 

 **b. Ramorum disease of larch \( **Phytophthora ramorum**\)** 

 This disease was first identified in UK trees in 2010. Defra was required to provide advice to landowners on management involving removal of infected and surrounding Japanese larch trees, widely grown in the UK. Models from Cambridge were used to provide optimal guidance for the extent of these removals, many of which were statutorily prescribed. The models have been central in a programme from 2014 onwards. \[E6\] 

 **c. Oak Processionary Moth** 

 This pest of oak trees, accidentally introduced to England in 2005, also causes a harmful rash in humans; it is established in most of Greater London and in some surrounding counties. The Cambridge group provided the Forestry Commission with a set of surveillance plans based upon estimates from epidemiological models for the spread of the pest. These have improved the effectiveness of the surveillance in three successive years \(2017\-2020\) and the identification of caterpillar nests for removal. \[E6\] 

 **d. Citrus greening disease** 

 Citrus greening disease is threatening the productivity of the citrus industry in California, which covers over 131,000 hectares, and has an annual value of USD3.84B. Prof. Gilligan was commissioned in 2015 by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \(APHIS\) of the United States Department of Agriculture \(USDA\) to model the spread of the insect vector and disease. A Quantitative Analyst/Entomologist at the USDA says that the outputs have “been invaluable in informing policy advice by the USDA and the California Department of Food and Agriculture for the surveillance, preparedness and management”. These agencies have an annual spend of USD40M per annum in California for such activities. \[E7\] The disease had already caused a >75%  drop in productivity in Florida, and the management programmes implemented using the outcomes of Prof. Gilligan’s modelling are designed to prevent similar losses in California. The California citrus industry generates approximately 21,674 full\-time equivalent jobs \(Babcock, 2018\), and work from the Cambridge group has enabled authorities “to avert a potential agricultural disaster that would impact on farm owners and farm workers” \[E7\]

We show that it is possible to characterize the disease transmission process under these conditions. Two innovations in our work are (i) accounting for control measures via time dependence of the infectious process and (ii) including seasonal and host age effects in the model of the latent period. By estimating parameters in different subregions of a large commercially cultivated orchard, we establish a temporal pattern of invasion, host age dependence of the dispersal parameters, and a close to linear relationship between primary and secondary infectious rates. The model can be used to simulate Huanglongbing epidemics to assess economic costs and potential benefits of putative control scenarios.

Aggressive strains of the obligate pathogenic fungus Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici (Pgt), causing the crop disease wheat stem rust, have been detected in East Africa and the Middle East, where they lead to substantial economic losses and threaten livelihoods of farmers. The majority of commercially grown wheat cultivars worldwide are susceptible to these emerging strains, which pose a risk to global wheat production, because the fungal spores transmitting the disease can be wind-dispersed over regions and even continents1–11. Targeted surveillance and control requires knowledge about airborne dispersal of pathogens, but the complex nature of long-distance dispersal poses significant challenges for quantitative research12–14. We combine international field surveys, global meteorological data, a Lagrangian dispersion model and high-performance computational resources to simulate a set of disease outbreak scenarios, tracing billions of stochastic trajectories of fungal spores over dynamically changing host and environmental landscapes for more than a decade. This provides the first quantitative assessment of spore transmission frequencies and amounts amongst all wheat producing countries in Southern/East Africa, the Middle East and Central/South Asia. We identify zones of high air-borne connectivity that geographically correspond with previously postulated wheat rust epidemiological zones (characterized by endemic disease and free movement of inoculum)10,15, and regions with genetic similarities in related pathogen populations16,17. We quantify the circumstances (routes, timing, outbreak sizes) under which virulent pathogen strains such as ‘Ug99’5,6 pose a threat from long-distance dispersal out of East Africa to the large wheat producing areas in Pakistan and India. Long-term mean spore dispersal trends (predominant direction, frequencies, amounts) are summarized for all countries in the domain (Supplementary Data).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The recorded jazz trio has traditionally been presented as a self\-balancing ensemble, performing in a supportive acoustic environment which recalls an intimate live concert. By continuing to adhere to this historic paradigm, most recordings fail to reflect evolving practices. Williams’ extensive research as a producer/engineer implements innovative techniques in spatialisation and signal processing derived from electronic, electro\-acoustic and popular music production to capture and present the jazz ensemble in a genre\-defying way. By changing perspectives and practices of musicians and producers across the world, this research has contributed to a renaissance of contemporary jazz. This is most clearly evidenced by the band GoGo Penguin’s critical and commercial success: their second album, V2.0, was nominated for the 2014 Mercury Music Prize and their fourth album, A Humdrum Star, was Blue Note Record’s second highest selling album of 2018. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prior to his collaboration with GoGo Penguin, Williams recorded a string of well\-received acoustic jazz releases for the Gondwana Records imprint. This included Matthew Halsall’s 2011 MOBO nominated *On The Go* and iTunes’ 2014 jazz album of the year *When the World Was One.* Both created a traditional jazz aesthetic by recording in large reverberant acoustic spaces, with little reliance upon modern isolation techniques. In 2013, Williams and Joe Reiser \(co\-producer/engineer on the cited outputs\) set out to explore how methods of acoustic isolation more commonly used in pop/rock recording could be implemented in the context of part\-improvised acoustic performance, reflecting GoGo Penguin’s eclectic influences, ranging far beyond the world of jazz. 

 **Questions addressed by the research:** 

-  How can moments of sensitive improvisation be retained when performers are acoustically isolated in order to achieve maximum detail \(and potentials for processing\) in capture? 

-  In what way can acoustically isolated capture techniques be treated in the mix, both in order to spatially reintegrate parts using non\-traditional methods and to extend the accepted production vocabulary of jazz? 

-  How can these techniques be implemented in real time in order that they directly inform performance, arrangement and composition? 

 Williams worked collaboratively with the band and Reiser in the Low Four, 80Hz and Giant Wafer studios to create an aural and physical environment which was both conducive to improvisation \(line of sight between the performers and detailed headphone mixes were integral\) and allowed for sonic experimentation at the recording and mixing stage of the production process. These techniques allowed the band’s album, *V2.0* **\[3.1\]**, to explore how instrument\-specific electromechanical reverberation techniques could be incorporated into an acoustic landscape. Additionally, this enabled real\-time drum re\-enforcement \(via analogue synthesis\) to be utilised, referencing much of the electronic music which influenced the compositions. 

 The research conducted through the recording of their third album, *Man Made Object* **\[3.2\]**, built upon the techniques explored previously while experimenting more deeply with natural reverberation techniques. The record was mixed at 80Hz Studio, where the large live room was put to use as a complex reverberation chamber. Williams/Reiser set out to establish whether sonic reference could be made to the ‘classic’ era of Blue Note Records output within the context of this evolving aesthetic landscape. Williams’ experiences as a composer and technician facilitating performances of electro\-acoustic material led to the construction of a multi\-speaker array – representing the key instrumentation of piano, bass and drums – which enabled finely detailed control of spatialisation in an environment which would have functioned very differently \(on an acoustic level\) had the band physically performed in the space. Further research explored the use of sympathetic resonances from upright pianos as reverberation treatments \( *Quiet Mind*\), the wilful saturation and distortion of entire ensemble performances and extreme differentiation of perceived spatial location \( *Smarra*\). 

 In Summer 2017 the band, Williams and Reiser reconvened to record *A Humdrum Star* in Low Four **\[3.3\]**. This facility offered further potential for instrumental isolation, resulting in detail at the stage of initial capture which, previously, had been unachievable. The channel counts for the recording were significantly expanded \(from 24 to 32 simultaneous inputs\) to enable extended capture of real time processing. The previous albums had made extensive use of innovative spatialisation and timbral treatments, but much of this had happened in the post\-performance, mixdown stages of the projects. The producers specifically wanted to explore how complex headphone mixes which allowed the band to ‘play into’ simulated spaces \(acoustic, electromechanical and algorithmic\) alongside extreme saturation/distortion processes would affect their performances at source. Following the recording stage, an adapted reverberation chamber was put into use in the mix process; the 80Hz live room was used to construct a multi\-speaker, surround\-reverberation chamber which was captured using binaural microphone techniques. This reverberation was integrated within the standard stereo release of the record. 

 GoGo Penguin’s fifth \(self\-titled\) album **\[3.4\]** was released on 4 June 2020. At this time there was a clear intention for collaboration between Blue Note and music technology giant Sennheiser to work towards a binaural release of the album. This process was stalled by the COVID\-19 pandemic, but a successful ‘proof of concept’ was delivered by Williams and Reiser and demonstrated in an online research seminar as part of the  [MuPaCT series](https://mupact.com/seminar-program-may-jul-2020). 

 **Key findings of this research:** 

-  A set of innovative spatialisation practices were established implementing electromechanical, algorithmic and re\-amplification techniques 

-  Recording jazz/improvisation in isolated spaces enables the producer to resituate its aesthetic, both spatially and timbrally, without compromising the needs of \(and at times directly influencing\) the improvising performers 

-  Binaural reverberation techniques utilising multi\-speaker arrays can be successfully integrated within standard stereo album releases without compromising loudspeaker representation 

-  Multiple binaural techniques \(point source recording, re\-amplification and HRTF\) can successfully be combined in a creative context. There is a market for surround ‘headphone only’ versions of album releases, supported by collaboration between major record labels and tech companies.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Williams’ transformative research has been, and continues to be, integral to the success of GoGo Penguin **\[3.1 – 3.4\]**. The band themselves and their immediate technical/administrative team have benefited hugely as a direct result of the reach and impact of the recorded music. Further to this, the team’s purposefully eclectic and technologically innovative techniques have stimulated commentary, dialogue and debate amongst critics and audiences alike regarding the position and relevance of contemporary jazz. Finally, other practitioners and prominent industry figures in the field of engineering and production have noted how the techniques derived from this research have enriched and developed the sound of contemporary jazz to the extent that final outputs defy easy genre classification. 

 **4.1. Impact on the band** 

 Following the success of *V2.0  \[3.1\]**, GoGo Penguin signed a recording contract with Blue Note Records, the world’s longest established jazz label, who are backed by the Universal/Decca group. Their next album, *Man Made Object* **\[3.2\]**, received positive worldwide reviews, with The Wall St Journal stating: *‘To ask whether GoGo Penguin plays jazz misses the point \[…\] of the sense of adventure in contemporary popular music \[...\] They are experimentalists in pursuit of superior improvisational music. The groove matters most \[...\] the trio knows what it’s doing and does it exceptionally well’* **\[5.1\]** and The Guardian adding *‘…the captivating Smarra is a highlight for its threading of an echoey, synth\-mimicking throb through a humming undertow toward a deluge of cymbals \[…\] plenty of house and techno fans might be surprised by how good at partying three closet\-jazzers can be’* **\[5.2\]**. Subsequently, *A Humdrum Star* **\[3.3\]** peaked at number 5 in the US jazz charts in March 2018, making the album the second biggest selling Blue Note release of the year. 

 Over the course of seven years Williams’ research has impacted directly on the band’s compositional and arrangement process. The band’s pianist reflected that *‘both in the studio and when performing live, I’ve significantly adapted the way I play \[…\] One of the most notable examples is when we use electronic effects and preparations on the piano; the techniques Williams and Reiser have suggested have changed my approach to performance, which in turn has influenced my compositional practice’* **\[5.3\]**. Regarding the track, *Don’t Go,* the pianist adds: *‘Williams/Reiser had decided to bring three binaural dummy heads to the studio and I remember us exploring all sorts of interesting techniques with them, finally settling on the effect we used at the end of Don’t Go when Williams physically walked the head away from the piano as I was playing and then closed the studio door to finish the piece. We discussed these ideas collaboratively, making the piano sound like it was a mechanical loop \[…\] We settled on the way we were going to play and record that track at the studio, shaping the arrangement and our performances ‘in the moment’’* **\[5.3\]**. 

 The band’s manager echoes this: *‘I think one of the things which Brendan and Joe have done really well with GoGo Penguin aside from recording the tracks, mixing it beautifully and the production \[…\] is actually just getting the band in the studio; getting the performances out of them and helping them sort out the arrangements.’ ‘Then there’s things like the tuning of the drums and the preparations which Brendan contributes to, making the drums sound like a drum machine, which is an unusual tuning in this world, all of these things happen before you even start recording’* **\[5.4\]**. 

 **4.2. Commercial impact** 

 Research embodied in the outputs has been disseminated to a large and diverse non\-academic audience through the worldwide release of four albums. Notable moments such as the Mercury Music Prize nomination and the backing of Blue Note Records increased listenership enormously. As well as the band receiving regular ‘spot plays’, the track *Bardot* was playlisted on BBC 6 Music, which had a weekly listenership of  [2,487,000](https://bit.ly/3cbqc4A) in 2019. In September 2018, the band performed on US public radio’s NPR ‘Tiny Desk Sessions’ \(NPR Music has approximately  [5,350,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47XlUL6sRow) subscribers\). 

 The following table detailing numbers of record sales and streams \(Spotify/Apple Music etc.\) was prepared by GoGo Penguin’s manager **\[5.4\]**, for the purpose of this study on 6 February 2020. The figures clearly illustrate the reach of the recorded artefacts with regards to non\-academic audiences. 

 **\[Text removed for publication\]** 

 **4.3. Impact on live audiences** 

 Audiences for the band’s live performances have grown at an impressive rate: the trio have played festivals as diverse as Tokyo Jazz, Belgium’s Pukkelpop and UK’s Latitude. Recent tours have seen GoGo Penguin headline the Royal Albert Hall \(5250 capacity\) and develop in South Africa, South Korea, Indonesia and Russia **\[5.5\]**. The diversity of audiences for the band is notable: they have ‘crossed over’ the genre boundaries that typically restrict a jazz trio. GoGo Penguin’s Manager states: ‘ *In terms of Europe, in this area of contemporary jazz or ‘jazz\-not\-jazz’, whatever you want to call it, GGP are arguably the biggest, most successful band. They’re the band that are on Blue Note, selling the most records, the most tickets across Europe’* **\[5.4\]** *.* 

 The band’s live sound engineer strives to closely represent the aesthetic language of the recorded artefacts, further broadening the reach of the research. He states: *‘These drastic shifts in the space and tone mimicking the records are a marked departure from what is normally expected of a live jazz show where the aim is usually accurate and faithful reinforcement \[…\] Audience members frequently come to talk to me after a gig and specifically comment on the production aesthetic of the show, asking how I am creating the sounds and effects in the mix and often commenting “it sounds like the record”’* **\[5.6\]**. 

 **4.4. Impact on industry and practitioners** 

 The recordings embody the findings of Williams’ practice\-based research. As a result of the recording’s reach, the impact can be observed through a notable change in the aesthetic of contemporary recorded jazz. It has become commonplace to hear more detailed – close microphone reliant – capture and presentation with more prominent implementation of spatialisation techniques which do not imply traditional performance spaces or seek to present a ‘documentary style’ of recording and mix presentation. Owner and producer at the 80Hz studio notes: *‘After observing Brendan’s approach to co\-producing GoGo Penguin with Joe Reiser, it's clear that while he has a comprehensive grip on the tried and test \[sic\] methods of the past \(when recording jazz\), it made sense that the forward\-thinking artist gave way to more innovative production ideas and methods \[…\] An example of which being the use of the Neumann KU 100 binaural head, to capture surround sound room ambience & thus provide a more visceral experience of depth and imaging in the ambient space. This method will also provide quality content for listening technologies around the corner, not yet mainstream’* **\[5.7\]**. 

 Head of Artist & Repertoire at Decca Records/Blue Note \(France\) describes the contribution Williams’ research has made to the band’s outputs and their relationship with the broader context of contemporary jazz: *‘The way Brendan produces \[GoGo Penguin\] with Joe is an approach that I find full of innovation and modernism. Something that is not common in the Jazz World.’ ‘Installation of the room, choices of the mic, their placements, choices of the plug in \[…\] overdubs, \[…\] I can feel that they are in the centre of these decisions that help to get the best raw materials from the band’* **\[5.8\]**. 

 As a direct reaction to the band’s outputs, a new sub\-genre has now been coined: ‘ *acoustic electronica’*. The term has been adopted by UK/US/European press to describe this emerging sound, for example in a Minn Post article, ‘British band GoGo Penguin brings ‘acoustic electronica’ to the Dakota’, in which the term is contextualised: *‘We saw them last Friday at the Monterey Jazz Festival, where they played for a full house – about 700 people – in one of the festival’s venues. People were moving and grooving to the music, a driving, danceable, accretive and infectious mix of jazz, classical, and electronic elements, with minimalist melodies and crescendos that bring crowds to their feet’* **\[5.9\]** *.*

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 This case study shows how the Secretary of State’s eventual decision in 2018 to block the proposed merger between 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox and Sky on plurality grounds was rooted in evidence produced by Schlosberg over the course of the merger review, as referenced by the Secretary of State, Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\). The cost of the deal was put at £11.7 billion and it would have given 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox access to Sky’s 22 million customers in Europe and given the Murdoch family full control over the UK’s third largest television news provider, and an unparalleled news audience reach across platforms. 

 The implications of the CMA’s findings extend beyond the merger and set important precedents for media plurality regulation going forward. Ofcom’s report to the Secretary of State on media ownership rules in November 2018 repeated the CMA’s conclusions, noting that “the evidence indicates that the rise of news online has not yet materially reduced the influence of traditional news” whose “content is widely consumed on third party platforms”. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Probing the significance of agenda influence by mainstream and legacy news has formed the bedrock of Dr Schlosberg’s research into media plurality, most comprehensively addressed in his 2016 book *Media Ownership and Agenda Control* \(Routledge\)<sup>4</sup>. 

 This book revisited critical questions of media ownership and political economy amidst the complexities of the information age, from the resurgence of press barons to the new influence wielded by tech giants. It drew on a body of research led by Schlosberg and dating back to 2012. 

 A key message from Schlosberg’s research is that digital platforms like Google and Facebook are not inherently pluralising forces when it comes to news consumption, and that there remain a very small number of news providers at the level of wholesale daily newsgathering. In contrast to what is often assumed, the voice of ‘legacy media’ – including newspapers and television news – tends to be amplified rather than marginalised by the platforms. This is set against an emergent consensus on the need to replace legacy frameworks for regulating plurality, but a degree of policy inertia and uncertainty over how to do it. 

 Many of Schlosberg’s published outputs contain key policy recommendations that have gained significant traction in media policy debates, ranging from a proposed levy on intermediaries to reforms of the public interest test governing media mergers<sup>3,5</sup>.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Over the course of the 2010s, the internet has become an increasingly common way in which people access the news. This has produced a number of emergent policy and regulatory challenges, not least concerning how to ensure that the public is exposed to plural sources of news. In the UK and much of the developed world, the ascendance of platform monopolies has coincided with the consolidation of reach and dominance by ‘legacy’ media in the online news market. 

 Schlosberg’s research has been instrumental in understanding this rapidly changing landscape, the dangers it poses to media plurality, and in shaping governmental response. In 2014, Schlosberg was invited to present oral evidence to a Lords Select Committee Inquiry into media plurality, on behalf of the Media Reform Coalition and on the basis of his 2013 book on *Power beyond Scrutiny* \(output 6\). His evidence was cited in the Committee’s  [final report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldselect/ldcomm/120/120.pdf)<sup>1</sup><sup>a</sup> immediately prior to a key recommendation: that any monitoring and assessment of media plurality should not limit itself to the media channel through which content is primarily delivered but should also factor in the influence of digital intermediaries. The government subsequently endorsed this recommendation in its response to the report<sup>1b</sup>. 

  

 In 2015, Schlosberg was invited to author an essay for the influential Westminster think tank ResPublica on the  [*Mission of Media in an Age of Monopoly*](http://www.respublica.org.uk/our-work/publications/mission-media-age-monopoly/) *.* In addition to echoing his evidence to the Select Committee, in this essay Schlosberg pushed the recommendation that major online platforms should be subject to plurality regulation. In 2018, Schlosberg also pressed this point with Dame Cairncross ahead of her government\-commissioned review into the  [sustainability of journalism](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/779882/021919_DCMS_Cairncross_Review_.pdf) *.* A key recommendation from the Cairncross Review was that a news quality obligation should be imposed on online platforms<sup>2</sup>. The Cairncross review was accepted by the government and in the resulting 2019  [white paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper/online-harms-white-paper) on Online Harms called for a new code of practice and imposed a statutory duty of care on online platforms which included the objective of “promoting diverse news content” directly in line with Schlosberg’s recommendations<sup>3</sup>. 

 The evidence produced by Schlosberg’s research directly informed the Government’s review of the proposed merger between 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox Inc and Sky Plc. 

 In December 2016, Fox and Sky announced their intention to merge. The cost of this deal was put at £11.7 billion \(or GBP11,700,000,000\) and it would have given 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox access to Sky’s 22 million \(i.e. 22,000,000\) customers in Europe<sup>4</sup>. Most controversially, it would have allowed the Murdoch family to gain complete control over Sky News – the UK’s third biggest television news provider – alongside their existing dominance in both print and online news markets. \(Fox was also in a second £54.2 billion \(or GBP54,200,000,000\) merger negotiation with Disney at the same time which, if both mergers went ahead, would, by default, have given Disney full ownership of Sky, extending its global reach into Europe significantly\). The Fox/Sky merger proposal was submitted for government approval and opened to public consultation. From the beginning, Schlosberg’s research proved pivotal in opposing the merger. 

 Schlosberg wrote an initial report on behalf of Media Reform Coalition and Avaaz on the likely impact of the proposed merger on plurality \(output 2 in the underpinning research section\). According to the then Secretary of State, this was one of ‘approximately 50 written submissions’ from third parties submitted to the government in the wake of the merger proposal, but the only one cited in  [her letter of March 2017](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/610045/r_20130303_Sky_letter_FINAL.pdf) to the merging parties<sup>5</sup>. This informed the parties of her provisional decision to refer the merger for regulatory review, noting that “Aspects of \[Schlosberg’s\] report appear to support some of the considerations \[…\] that have informed the Secretary of State's current provisional view.” 

 Ofcom’s subsequent  [<ins>public interest test report</ins>](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/103620/public-interest-test-report.pdf)<sup>6</sup> in June 2017 made 26 references to a further submission authored by Schlosberg, considerably more than any other by third party experts or civil society groups. Issues which were uniquely vocalised in Schlosberg’s submission and featured Ofcom’s report include arguments about wholesale and inter\-media agenda influence. These were flagged in the key findings as raising substantial concerns about the public interest risks posed by the deal. 

 The second phase of the inquiry, which opened in September 2017, focused on two public interest grounds for considering the impact of the proposed merger: media plurality and a commitment to broadcasting standards. Schlosberg was the sole expert speaking to media plurality issues in  [<ins>a hearing convened</ins>](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a169f5740f0b627df214220/campaign-groups-transcript-hearing-271017.pdf) by the Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\) with advocacy groups and other third parties in October 2017 and was the individual subject to most questions fielded by the CMA<sup>7</sup>. 

 Throughout the inquiry, Schlosberg was the sole author of reports and submissions on plurality made on behalf of the Media Reform Coalition and Avaaz but his work was recognised by other organisations who also campaigned against the merger primarily on grounds of the detrimental impact to broadcasting standards. 

 In November 2017, 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox submitted a  [<ins>93\-page dossier</ins>](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a0ae27e40f0b60b04839a98/fox-reply-to-mra-and-avaaz-response-to-issues-statement.pdf) to the CMA solely focussed on critiquing Schlosberg’s evidence, including two appended reports by commercial consultancy firms. Schlosberg responded  [<ins>in full</ins>](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a38df26e5274a7908e35d5d/media_reform_coalition.pdf) to this submission at the invitation of the CMA in a report that included a statement of support from Professor Philip M. Napoli, a leading global authority on media plurality whose record of publications and testimony to US regulators is extensive. 

 Both the CMA’s  [<ins>provisional findings</ins>](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a71fe2be5274a7f9c5862d4/provisional_findings_report.pdf)<sup>9a</sup> in January 2018 and  [<ins>final report</ins>](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cma-phase-2-report)<sup>9b</sup> published by the CMA in May 2018 broadly concurred with Ofcom’s findings and the arguments on plurality put forward by Schlosberg, including several direct quotations from his authored submissions and an  [<ins>appendix</ins>](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a6f31cce5274a0a3ad91fcf/appendices_and_glossary.pdf)<sup>9b</sup> in which Schlosberg’s analysis of news agenda leading was profiled \(along with a similar study conducted by researchers at Cardiff University in 2015\). This appendix found that ‘The evidence in these studies does, however, support the view at least that traditional news providers \(whether on their established print or broadcast medium or online\) together play a significant part in driving the news agenda.’ 

 The CMA went further than Ofcom’s public interest test report and adjusted Ofcom’s allocation of cross\-platform market shares to reflect, in part, two key findings from Schlosberg’s research: 1\) in the UK, much of the news consumed via intermediaries is in fact produced by wholesale news providers, including those owned and controlled by the Murdoch family and 2\) much of the news delivered by commercial UK radio stations is in fact produced by Sky. 

 The CMA concluded that these adjustments contributed to an increase in the combined market share attributable to Newscorp/Sky \(were the merger to go ahead\) by up to 3%. This adjustment meant that the merged entity would overtake ITN, giving it the largest cross\-market wholesale share of any news organisation apart from the BBC. 

 The CMA further underscored the significance of this by pointing out that the increase in market share as a result of the merger is large relative to the shares of all other established news providers, except BBC and ITN. But unlike Sky, both BBC and ITN have additional public service regulations which promote plurality. 

 Ultimately, the CMA found that the merger ‘may be expected to operate against the public interest taking account of the need, in relation to every different audience in the UK or in a particular area or locality of the UK, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience \(the media plurality consideration\).’ 

 On 1<sup>st</sup> May 2018 the CMA submitted their final report to the Secretary of State, who accepted the CMA’s recommendation that the anticipated acquisition was not in the public interest due to media plurality concerns, a decision which sets an important precedent in media plurality policy and regulation in the UK.<sup>10</sup>

<p>The research contributed to a re-evaluation of The New Humanitarian (TNH), a key media news source for policymakers and the humanitarian aid sector. These changes led humanitarian agencies to pay attention to ‘forgotten crises’, leading to action that would otherwise not have been offered. Most notable is the TNH’s reporting on the ‘overlooked’ March 2018 Yazidi healthcare crisis in Iraq. This reporting resulted in immediate action from the UN migration agency and Doctors Without Borders, among others. By the end of 2018, the main hospital serving the Yazidi minority had been moved to a safer and better-equipped facility and acquired new ambulances. TNH doubled their citation of ‘local experts’ in coverage between 2015-2017 and increased the proportion of ‘investigative’ or ‘campaigning’ journalism in their outputs. This helped humanitarian professionals develop policies that address the most urgent challenges in remote crises. For example, a 2018 TNH investigation into alleged chronic corruption in the UN’s resettlement process in Sudan caused the UN’s refugee agency to suspend resettlement operations there subject to further review. TNH’s reformed reporting has impacted the aid sector at an institutional level. For example, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and others have used TNH as a source when lobbying the UN Human Rights Council for an inquiry into abuse against the Rohingya.

<h6>Visual Media Literacy for Combating Misinformation</h6>
<p>The Visual Social Media Lab (VSML) carried out a number of impact activities, culminating in the ‘Questioning Images’ (QI) resource. QI has underpinned election-related media literacy campaigns in Canada and Colombia in 2019. These activities reached ~9,000 teachers and 1.2 million pupils in Canada (70% of all schools in Canada), and 199 school and 76,000 pupils in Colombia. The VSML also responded rapidly to COVID-19 misinformation, producing a teacher’s guide which trained 80 schools in Manchester, reaching 1,600 pupils.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The school component of English In Action \(EIA\) was a large\-scale project designed with the aim of improving English language teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools across Bangladesh. Using: i\) material delivered by mobile technologies; ii\) teacher development activities in the workplace and iii\) peer support opportunities, EIA provided an innovative way of improving English language teaching at scale. The EIA programme achieved large\-scale systemic engagement from teachers, head teachers and education officers across all eight divisions and 64 districts of Bangladesh. This has delivered an impact on: i\) **practitioners** by changing the classroom practice of 53,271 teachers \- away from presenting to students and towards encouraging more student\-talk in English ii\) **learning** by improving the English language competence of 7.4 million students and iii\) **public policy** by influencing two Government bodies to incorporate EIA materials into their curriculum resources and engage EIA expertise in the design of content for new teacher development programmes \- thus embedding the EIA materials and pedagogic approach within the Bangladesh educational system, to secure long\-term, sustainable, systemic change and iv\) public policy by influencing approaches to teacher development outside of Bangladesh.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 For many years, English language was the most failed subject in schools in Bangladesh. Poor quality English language teaching was identified as a root cause, with teachers not knowing how to put ‘Communicative Language Teaching’ into practice. Teachers themselves had limited English skills and students typically had very little opportunity to speak in English during English language lessons. Funded by DFID, over a 10\-year period, the school component of EIA focused on demonstrably improving English language teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools across Bangladesh. Researchers from the OU worked with international partners BMB Mott McDonald and BBC Media Action, as well as local NGOs such as Underprivileged Children’s Educational Programs \(UCEP\) and Friends in the Village Development Bangladesh \(FIVDB\) to develop an iterative EIA programme of research and development. Between 2008 and 2011 OU researchers developed and trialled their working hypothesis which posited that the most effective way of achieving large\-scale teacher development in Communicative English Language Teaching in Bangladesh was to implement a programme that was: 

 **Technology\-enabled**: bespoke audio resources alongside teacher development videos, that demonstrate and explore Communicative Language Teaching approaches in authentic classroom settings, are delivered using devices such as iPods/MP3 players or mobile phones. 

 **School\-based**: teacher development activities are delivered in the workplace \- where teachers enquire into their own classroom practice, explore new teaching\-learning approaches, and develop practical insights into improving student learning. 

 **Networked**: Teachers' development progresses through peer\-learning and shared journeys of discovery, as opposed to cascading 'knowledge' through teacher educators. 

 The initial EIA ‘intervention’ at the heart of the programme was therefore a school\-based professional development model that blended Technology Enhanced Learning \(where Communicative Language Teaching principles and examples were delivered through audio\- visual material on an MP3 player\) with face\-to\-face support, such as orientation workshops, cluster meetings with teachers on the same programme and visits from teacher facilitators. The appropriateness of this model was examined by conducting observations and interviews with 6 schools that were participating in a pre\-pilot intervention in 2009 \(randomly chosen from 15 pre\-pilot schools\). Data from classroom observations, regarding how teachers were using the technology, informed interviews with 12 teachers. Results indicated that the teachers responded well to both the pre\-loaded material on the iPod and the peer support from cluster meetings and facilitator visits. Furthermore, changes in practice were being reported after just four months **\[O1\]**. Further studies enabled a more nuanced understanding of the influence of the intervention. For example, field\-tests were undertaken with 40 teachers between March and April 2011 in order to ascertain whether teachers would prefer to use mobile phones \(with SD cards that contained pre\-loaded EIA material\) rather than iPods. Analysis of data taken from surveys, interviews and focus groups indicated that teachers preferred using mobile phones and found it easy to use the SD cards. These results informed the Upscaling Phase of EIA and enabled the programme to implement a more sustainable way forward **\[O2, O3\]**. Semi\-structured interviews were conducted with 600 primary school children from schools, in different regions in Bangladesh, who were participating in the pilot intervention phase in 2010. These interviews were used to examine the children’s beliefs concerning English language Learning and their perceptions regarding English language Teaching in an EIA pilot intervention school. Results indicated that overall, the children responded well to, and had positive beliefs about, the value of the activities associated with a Communicative Language Teaching approach **\[O4\]**. Finally, an overarching evaluation of the pilot intervention phase, used case study examples to illuminate the conclusion that teacher facilitators needed more support and guidance on how to enact their role in order to improve the effectiveness of the school\-based support model **\[O5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The EIA programme achieved large\-scale systemic engagement from teachers, head Teachers and education officers across all eight divisions and 64 districts of Bangladesh **\[C1\]**. Between 1st August 2013 to March 2018 EIA dramatically increased its reach, through a shift away from direct contact with international and national English Language Teaching \(ELT\) experts, towards a distinctive model where ELT practice expertise was embedded in Mediated Authentic Videos accessed on mobile phones, delivered through partnership with Government Teacher Professional Development systems and staff, and supported primarily by teachers’ peers \(including Teacher Facilitators\). From August 2013 to March 2018, over 53,000 teachers participated in EIA: 10,563 secondary teachers and 42,708 primary teachers **\[C2\]**. Collectively, these teachers taught approximately 7.4M school children \(3.1M primary and 4.3M secondary children\) **\[C2\]**. More specifically, EIA has achieved impacts on **practitioners**, **learning** and **public policy** in Bangladesh by: i\) changing the classroom practice of teachers; ii\) improving the English Language competence of students; iii\) shaping the content of English Language Teaching Curriculum Material and iv\) influencing approaches to teacher development in Bangladesh and v\) influencing approaches to teacher development outside of Bangladesh, demonstrating global impact. 

1.  **Changing the classroom practice of teachers** 

 There is evidence that EIA has contributed to changes in teachers’ confidence to speak English and use English in the classroom. For example, at a divisional workshop in Rajshahi in 2017, teachers underlined that EIA had triggered inner changes in them, which they saw as a pre\-condition for changing students: *“I changed myself, now I am a change maker. Without a change in students, a teacher is 0” \(*Assistant Teacher English/secondary and Teacher Facilitator, Rajshahi division, 23.8.2017\); *“EIA has developed me personally and professionally”* \(participant, Rajshahi Divisional Workshop, 23.8.2017\). The participants also reported that they felt more at ease speaking English among themselves and with their students: *“Now I am able to speak in English in any forum”* \(participant, Rajshahi Divisional Workshop, 23.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. EIA has also brought about changes in the classroom practices of teachers. In 2014\-2015, 1,600 teachers provided self\-report data, analysis of which indicated that over 71% said they used the teacher development videos every week and over 80% said they used EIA activities in the classroom every week. Government Education Officers observed 4,727 classrooms during this time and found that that 61% of students were seen using English in more than 50% of their talk\-time, with 86% of lessons including pair and group work **\[C3\]**. Systematic timed observations of 346 lessons by the 2014\-2015 cohort of teachers, showed similar changes in practice. The results show that both primary and secondary teachers are using a wide range of activities in the classroom and involving students in these activities. In this study, primary teachers were found to be organising 33% of the time, presenting 29% of the time, asking questions 18% of the time, and giving feedback 19% of the time. Secondary teachers were found to be organising 27% of the time, presenting 38% of the time, asking questions 21% of the time, and giving feedback 15% of the time. This is a change from the baseline study where teachers were observed to be primarily reading from the textbook and rarely involving students in activities **\[C4\]**. For 2015\-2016 teachers, a quasi\-experimental study \(including 163 systematic timed lesson observations\) found statistically significant experimental effects after only six months, just half\-way through the treatment. Primary and secondary teachers spent less time ‘presenting’ to students \(effect size r=0.2\); student\-student talk \(pair and group\) increased fourfold in primary lessons, from 4%pts to 16%pts \(effect size r=0.3\); whilst in secondary lessons, teachers and students both used more spoken English \(effect size 0.2\) **\[C5\]**. At a Divisional workshop in Rajshahi in August 2017, participants confirmed sustained use of the EIA interactive teaching activities and learners’ increased participation in the classes: *“Before EIA, I never used body language, acting and dancing in the classroom. I thought this was only for male teachers \[…\] that it was not for me. Now I use songs, rhymes, miming, acting, dancing. I feel very efficient in my work. My student teams are standing out in crowd at education and digital fairs. This is thanks to EIA. I changed myself and my sub\-district”* \(teacher participating in Rajshahi Divisional Workshop, 23.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. 

 **ii\) Improving the English language Competence of students** 

 There is large\-scale evidence for an improvement in learning outcomes for students who are taught by teachers who have engaged with EIA. Over 1,000 students \(579 primary, 480 secondary\) from the 2014 cohort took part in an end\-line study of English Language Competence \(ELC\), carried out by independent assessors. There were statistically significant differences showing substantial improvements over baseline for both primary and secondary students. For primary students, the pass\-rate rose 34.4%pts from 35.2% to 69.6%, whilst for secondary students, the pass\-rate rose 8.3%pts, from 74.5% to 82.8% **\[C6\]**. For 2015\-2016 students, a quasi\-experimental study \(1,802 students in pre\- and post\-test\) was conducted after only six months, just half\-way through the treatment. In treatment schools, the differences between pre\- and post\-test ELC were larger than in control schools \(rising by 0.3 Graded Examination in Spoken English \(GESE\) grades in treatment, compared to 0.2 grades in control\), but at this early stage the differences were not yet statistically significant. However, there were small\-to\-medium sized experimental effects for rural secondary students \(r=0.2\) and urban primary students \(r=0.2\) **\[C5\]**. Discussions with various stakeholders also indicate that teachers acknowledge that being in an EIA school has increased students’ confidence and proficiency in using English, in the classroom and among themselves: *“I visited 2\-3 classes in EIA schools in Manikgonj district. EIA is very fine; secondary students were spontaneously talking to us; students spoke English very fluently. In Bangladesh, children’s attitude towards English has changed. They have a courage for English and think that they can answer all questions. EIA has contributed to this. Students’ English results have also improved in the recent years. EIA has contributed to this”* \(Director \- Secondary at Department of Schools and Higher Education \(DSHE\), 21.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. 

 **iii\) Shaping the content of English language teaching curriculum materials in Bangladesh** 

 The EIA Programme team has influenced both primary and secondary curriculum in Bangladesh through its contributions to the work of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board \(NCTB\) in Bangladesh. BMB Mott MacDonald \(lead partner on EIA\) conducted two studies that produced recommendations, and the textbooks for primary schools were revised to implement these. EIA then helped review the new textbooks for primary teachers, grades one to five with regards to English language teaching. EIA worked with the Centre for British Teachers, who worked with NCTB, on the textbooks. The textbook revisions included the referencing of EIA classroom audios, where relevant to particular lessons. The new textbooks were distributed to teachers in 2013 \(grades one to three\) and 2015 \(grades four to five\). All teachers received EIA classroom audio recordings, as part of the NCTB’s distribution of the revised textbooks. The 2015 Terms of Reference for The NCTB Textbook Revision acknowledge EIA inputs into the English Textbooks for grades four to five **\[C1, C7\]**. ‘Teacher Editions’ are versions of the national textbook series that include instructional guides for teachers, on how to use the textbook content to support Communicative Language Teaching. In 2014, EIA technical experts contributed to writing all five Teacher Editions for English language primary teachers \(grades one to five\) **\[C8\]**. Content from EIA print materials \(i.e. *Activity Guides*\) were integrated into the Teacher Editions, particularly where they gave guidance regarding how to integrate digital audio resources in classroom teaching of specific lesson content. The Teacher Editions were published in August 2016. By 2017 they had been provided in print to every primary school \(two per school\) and had been distributed to all local Education Offices. They were also made available in soft copy on the NCTB website **\[C1\]**. Commissioned by the NCTB, EIA produced 36 audio recordings of ‘English for Today’ listening texts that accompany the NCTB textbooks for all secondary grades. Together with EIA’s own audios, these audios were uploaded on the NCTB website **\[C1\]**. The National Curriculum Coordinator Committee approved the audios and in 2014 the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education \(DSHE\) issued a circular asking all District Education Officers and Upazila Secondary Education Officers to ensure every head teacher/principal of a secondary school downloaded and used EIA audio materials **\[C9\]**. 

 **iv\) Influencing approaches to teacher development programmes in Bangladesh** 

 EIA materials and models have been integrated into in\-service teacher development in Bangladesh through the Subject\-Based Training \(SBT\) in English and the Customised Training Programme\-English \(CTP\-E\). SBT was a six\-day face\-to\-face training for in\-service teachers managed by the Department of Primary Education \(DPE\). The SBT Manual integrated 23 EIA A/V materials, and interactive teaching/learning activities. EIA supported the production of a Guide for trainers \(including a DVD with EIA digital contents\), and the training of 112 ‘Master Trainers’. Between 2014 and 2017, 115,000 Bangladeshi teachers have undergone SBT\-English, giving EIA inputs a wide reach. SBT has since stopped and has been replaced by the CTP\-E. The government has engaged several EIA staff as consultants in the design of the English element of this programme and its supporting materials \(e.g. Training Manual\) and the programme has integrated some of EIAs core components. For example, use of ICT and online/offline A/V materials is a key focus with all the trainers and teachers getting access to EIA digital A/V materials \(17 EIA videos have been integrated with different sessions on different days\) **\[C1\]**. Furthermore, most of the Government’s Master Trainers \(MTs\) for the CTP\-E are people who have been oriented to EIA, including many of EIA’s teacher facilitators/teachers: “ *EIA human resource is our resource*” \(DPE Deputy Director, 24.8.2017\). Among the 31 pilot Master Trainers, 22 have been oriented/exposed to EIA **\[C1\]**. 

 **v\) Influencing teacher development programmes outside of Bangladesh** 

 Key stakeholders have testified that EIA has had an impact beyond Bangladesh: *“EIA added to the global knowledge and debate around teacher professional development, by proposing a specific model based on 5 elements and by putting teachers at the centre of the classroom and evidencing what works in the classroom and to build teachers’ capacities”* \(DFID Education Adviser, 24.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. One example of the global impact of EIA is the Teacher Development Programme \(TDP\) in Nigeria. TDP, funded by DFID \(2013\-2019\), was implemented in partnership with the Nigerian Federal Government and 5 Northern State Governments. It aimed to improve the quality of teaching for 62,000 teachers in primary and junior secondary schools and in Colleges of Education. Several EIA staff members were commissioned to work with TDP on the construction of materials such as a Facilitators Guide and a Head Teachers Guide. In addition, TDP has modelled its approach on EIA, in that both EIA and TDP are school\-based teacher professional development programmes, with a blend of self\-study and face\-to\-face training and support **\[C1\]**. In 2017 the scale and quality of impacts achieved by the EIA project were recognised through two awards: The Times Higher Education Supplement \(THES\) award for International Impact \(November 2017\) and the Pie\-oneer Award for Progressive Education Delivery in H.E \(September 2017\). The THES judges said that EIA was a: *“clear winner for its global impact on English communication abilities in difficult\-to\-access regions”.* They commended staff at the OU *for their: “innovative and pragmatic solution as well as their collaborative approach, working with intergovernmental agencies and in\-country partners” and stated that “The OU’s development of teaching materials specifically designed for use on low\-cost mobile phones has had a transformative impact on the regions in which they have been deployed”.*

Robust evidence is required for approaches to be implemented with some confidence by Government development agencies, such as the UK Department for International Development (DFID). SBTD has a long history stemming from ideas of school‐based curriculum development, which underlay the ideas on teacher‐as‐researcher, and is typically advocated in the developed world based on a view of the teacher as a professional. How might such notions play out, and to what effect, in LEDC contexts? This article examines the issues at stake in introducing SBTD in LEDCs, by examining: the nature of the evidence for various forms of teacher development, the nature of SBTD in particular and the evidence for its effectiveness. The latter issues will be illustrated through examination of English in Action (EIA, www.eiabd.com ), a large‐scale SBTD programme for primary and secondary English language (EL) teachers serving government schools across Bangladesh.

teachers to provide continuing professional development (CPD) in emerging economies at scale are largely absent from the research literature. We outline English in Action’s (EIA) model for providing 80,000 teachers with CPD to improve their communicative language teaching in Bangladesh over nine years. EIA’s CPD program is delivered face to face and supported through open distance learning (ODL). This innovative model of teacher CPD is supported through peer learning and self-study using a variety of print, audio and video resources. Drawing on the success of EIA’s pilot studies, where internal and external evaluation reported significant improvement in teachers’ and students’ English-language competence after one year, the current phase is using low-cost mobile phones, or the ‘trainer in your pocket’ to deliver CPD to 12,500 teachers through 2015. We believe EIA’s teacher CDP model is best suited to assist the project in achieving one of its primary goals: to increase the English-language proficiency of 12 million students, allowing them to access greater social and economic opportunities in the future. We argue EIA’s use of mobile phones for the provision of teacher CPD – at scale – is timely and replicable in both developed and developing contexts.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors':

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Harry’s children’s opera *Vehicles* was performed to school children in March 2020. The opera, together with its accompanying workshops and animated resources, took youngsters on a tour of different types of vehicles throughout the ages, recontextualising science for the young audience and leaving them with the confidence to view scientific subjects as creative and innovative. *Vehicles* simultaneously encouraged children’s interest in opera, the arts and creativity more broadly in parts of the UK traditionally lacking in arts provision. In staging *Vehicles* in collaboration with Operasonic, a not\-for\-profit company focused on making opera accessible to young people, Harry’s opera inspired new ways of working for the company, informing their future practice and fostering a proactive sense of adaptability during the Covid\-19 pandemic. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The primary underpinning research for the project comprises an opera composition, which draws on Harry’s experience working on nine previous children’s operas in a variety of different community and school settings **\[R1\];** and a development of the research questions of creative collaboration and distributed creativity explored in his previous children’s opera *My Mother Told Me Not To Stare* \( *MMTMNTS*\) **\[R2\].** Harry’s children’s opera *Vehicles* sought to answer two specific questions: what contribution can *Vehicles* make in promoting feelings of self\-determination in young people living in areas which are traditionally lacking in arts provision; and to what extent can *Vehicles* address themes of creativity and innovation in such a way as to inspire young people to think differently about scientific careers such as engineering? 

 *Vehicles* was first commissioned by the children’s theatre company, Action Transport Theatre \(ATT\), with R&D funding from Arts Council England to work with children on the creation of a new opera in 2015. Blackbird Leys \(Oxfordshire\) and Ellesmere Port \(Cheshire\) were chosen as the locations for the creative devising workshops with children, since these areas are close to two large car factories, BMW Cowley and Vauxhall; they also lie in areas of the UK traditionally lacking in arts provision. The clear brief emerging from the workshops was that each scene should be based on a different vehicle technology \(spaceship, Formula 1 car, lorry, balloon, Roman galley, etc.\). Harry worked as librettist and composer with Nina Hajiyianni, director of ATT, to create a narrative that would deliver this remit while building in the dramatic situations upon which opera thrives. The development of transport technologies is explored in reverse order, after an opening crisis moment when the spaceship begins to travel backwards in time. The astronauts thereby encounter four scientific inventors \(William Morris, James Sadler, an unnamed caveman and Leonardo da Vinci\) and begin to appreciate the creative decisions that led to the development of their spaceship. The crisis is averted when Leonardo helps them build a time machine that will return them to their future time. 

  

 *Vehicles* was developed further in collaboration with Rhian Hutchings of Operasonic. As part of this new collaboration Harry rewrote the opera for four performers in order to better distinguish between the astronauts and the inventors they meet on their journey. Operasonic’s two performances of the final version of *Vehicles* at the Riverfront Theatre Newport on 2 March 2020 were attended by audiences of approximately 500 children. Hutchings’ interest in STEAM methodologies led to the creation of introductory primary school workshops that explored the notion of innovation in engineering, drawing on the examples of the inventor figures from the opera. Since the lockdown, this workshop content has been disseminated online. \( *Vehicles* will also be filmed for online dissemination, in order to replace the UK tour that had to be postponed in March 2020 due to COVID\-19.\) 

 *Vehicles* builds on research questions and practices developed in Harry’s previous children’s opera *MMTMNTS* **\[R2\]** *.* Harry examined the creative collaboration processes characteristic of large opera houses, small theatre companies and film music recording sessions, before applying these perspectives to the *MMTMNTS* project itself. He analysed the creative partnerships he had formed with directors, librettists and performers in his previous work as composer or orchestrator. The research for *MMTMNTS* was concerned with the way contributing artists negotiate creative time and space. Each creative collaboration was also influenced by its institutional setting and the terms of the original commission, which were sometimes even reflected in the identity of the artwork that emerged. *Vehicles* built on this research by examining the two sets of creative partners that gave rise to the opera/film, as well as the initiating role of the creative workshops with children.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Harry’s children’s opera, *Vehicles* **\[R1\]**, was composed specifically for audiences of 8 to 10 year\-old children and presented through a collaboration with Operasonic, a not\-for\-profit opera company focused on making opera accessible to young people. A tour of *Vehicles*, intended for three residencies in Newport \(Feb\-Mar 2020\), Didcot \(late Mar 2020\), and Ellesmere Port \(Sep 2020\), all of which are areas traditionally lacking in arts provision, was unavoidably scaled back and largely replaced by online performances and engagement due to the impact of COVID\-19. 

 **Recontextualised science for young children giving them renewed confidence in science as a subject and in the concept of experimentation** 

 Due to the COVID\-19 pandemic in 2020, only the Newport performance was able to take place on 4 March 2020, engaging 393 children from six primary schools from across Newport and one from Caerphilly. Students from four of the primary schools took part in additional activities: a drama workshop at their school; the performance of *Vehicles* at the Riverfront Theatre in Newport; and a post\-performance workshop online. Rhian Hutchings, Creative Director of Operasonic explains, ‘We started their journey with a drama workshop which introduced them to the characters of Captain Houston and Lieutenant Schmidt and explored the theme of invention. They then experienced the opera. After the opera we put the pupils through a space cadet training programme via a suite of animated resources which explored forces **\[C\]**. Pupils had to watch science explorations and then try out experiments and report back to their teachers’ **\[A\].** 

 The students – who were in Year 4 \(aged 8/9\) for the drama workshop and performance, and then had progressed to Year 5 \(aged 9/10\) when they took part in the online workshop – filled out questionnaires prior to the programme and again when the project finished. The results \(received from only one school due to lockdown disrupting the return of parental consent forms\) showed a clear increase in the children’s confidence in science with all who answered reporting some improvement and 76% answering that they now felt confident or more confident about science as a subject. The most significant rise in confidence reported by the children was in ‘experimentation’ with all responses showing an improvement and 88% reporting that they now felt ‘more confident’ or ‘definitely more confident’ about experimenting since watching the opera and taking part in the workshops **\[B\]**. 

 **Encouraged children’s interest in opera, the arts and creativity more broadly in areas traditionally lacking in arts provision** 

 Prior to watching *Vehicles*, questionnaires reveal that the children had a limited idea of opera with only one student being able to say that it included both singing and acting, and 76% stating that it concerned either singing or acting. This understanding improved significantly after viewing the opera whereby all of the children who recognised that an opera included singing, also stated that it included acting, revealing that the students now recognised the synthesis of the two. Similarly, the children’s interest in opera and confidence in their artistic skills grew. After viewing the opera and attending the first workshop, all of the children \(100%\) stated that they ‘believe\[d that they\] could become an artist’ and 76% agreed that they would like or quite like to see another opera one day **\[B\]**. 

 **Informed Operasonic’s future practice and that of the cast and crew of **Vehicles** while encouraging adaptability during Covid\-19** 

 In planning and realising Harry’s ‘ *Vehicles’* opera, Rhian Hutchings at Operasonic points to the benefits the company has experienced: ‘Collaborating with Martyn enabled Operasonic to… explor\[e\] the impact of opera on young people. Building an evidence base to prove the value of opera for young people helps to validate our work and create further opportunities to develop further pieces.’ She continues, ‘It’s been a key part of our strategy to build research but we haven’t had the contacts before now to put structured academic research around our work’ **\[A\].** 

 Of all of the activities offered, the children particularly enjoyed the online training with 88% reporting that they ‘really enjoyed’ the animated resources created due to the restrictions necessitated by Covid\-19 **\[B\]**. The YouTube resources which teach children through animation and short films about ‘push and pull’ forces, gravity and friction have already been viewed 97 times since they were released in September 2020 **\[C\]**. Hutchings confirms that the success of these bite\-size videos is having a direct effect on how Operasonic will work after the pandemic, ‘The pandemic has required that we change our plans and think differently about delivering in person. Moving our work to film is giving us the opportunity to create a package for schools that can be delivered in the classroom with in\-person support. This points the way forward to a new way of working for Operasonic’ **\[A\]**. 

 Members of the creative team working on *Vehicles* \(including a Producer, Baritone/Cellist, Designer and a Documentary Audio & Video Recorder\) also felt that their involvement with the opera would change the way they work moving forward. Responding to an online questionnaire sent after the Newport performance \(and during the lockdown stages of the pandemic\), half felt that ‘Opera for children is important and needs to be supported and continued’ **\[D\]**. A couple of responses also indicated that working on *Vehicles* would influence and change their practice, with one answering that the Opera ‘Reinforced and confirmed a commitment to \[the\] participatory arts’ and another answering that *Vehicles* had ‘Created a commitment to using the arts in a pedagogical manner’ **\[D\]**. The respondents particularly enjoyed the directness that is made possible by working on an opera for children and one respondent confirmed that they had ‘…since looked into how we can work with children in the future on various projects that we feel will be beneficial to the curriculum.’ **\[D\]**.

<p>Dr. Hafeda’s work on social art practice has produced long-term benefits to communities in London (2014-present), Portugal (2017-present), and Lebanon (2019-present). The ‘Shop of Possibilities’ (SoP), an art- and play-space commissioned by the South London Gallery (SLG) improved the development of 484 children, provided training for education professionals, and employment opportunities. The SoP was cited as best-practice in an independent report advising the Greater London Authority, garnering an additional £873,299 investment for the project. Hafeda’s work with Roma communities in Portugal inspired new community-led mediations to improve community relations. Hafeda’s work has inspired artists and curators working with marginalised communities elsewhere. For example, social artworks commissioned in marginalised communities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and for refugee children in Lebanon on the Syrian border. The projects have helped develop social and creative skills among 696 children, young people, and adults, empowering them to assert their rights and opinions by contributing to permanent social infrastructures.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Connections between people and place can be disrupted by historical divisions, incomers/migrants. Research at the Intercultural Research Centre \(IRC\) addressed the concept of placemaking in international locations. Lessons learned from international case\-studies had impact in three distinct UK places \(rural, urban and island\): Lough Neagh \(Northern Ireland\), the Northern Isles \(Orkney/Shetland\) and Leith Late \(Edinburgh city\). IRC research has rejuvenated a sense of belonging among local groups through archaeology, community mapping, workshops, and the co\-creation of cultural heritage work. These activities have rejuvenated community relations between Protestants and Catholics \(LN\), migrants and incomers \(NI\), artists, tourists, and local communities \(LL\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research from IRC staff has focused on cross\-community relations in Europe and Saudi Arabia. Our Research in Germany and the Baltic States \[3.1\] highlighted the pivotal role of heritage in resolving the displacement that prevented the development of sustainable communities in areas with migrants. Through analysing festival and pilgrimage settings \[3.2, 3.5 and 3.6\], our research identified common themes and challenges faced by communities, groups and individuals across heterogenous European and Asian settings, including the various effects of migration and tourism. Our research highlighted the significance of place in developing new community relations. By proposing a new way of thinking which links the built environment with people’s stories \(which may be at odds with one another\), the research highlighted the importance of material objects, communal storytelling and cultural heritage for a sense of belonging among locals and tourists, incomers and outsiders \[3.4\]. IRC case studies focused on festivals in Scotland, Germany, Romania and Saudi Arabia as well as their processes of inclusion and exclusion \[3.5 and 3.6\] With funding from the Scottish Graduate School for Arts and Humanities and Museums Galleries Scotland, and in collaboration with regional museums and local heritage groups, IRC research in the Northern Isles \(Scotland\) highlighted constraints that small island communities face, whether islanders or incomers \[3.6\]. That research informed a Horizon 2020 Work Package ‘Cultural forms and expressions of identity in Europe’. 

 IRC research has also explored relationships between local communities and tourisms in the UK and in the Mecca. Research in those locations highlighted the importance of opportunities for ‘cosmopolitan’ social interactions between tourists and locals such as such as shared eating spaces and group tours and activities \[3.5\]. The potential of artwork, storytelling, and festivals for cultivating a better understanding of place features strongly in IRC research \[3.2, 3.5 and 3.6\]. Our research noted that this is especially the case when such work is co\-created in collaboration with communities who have not worked together previously. This co\-creation of a shared heritage served as a catalyst for developing sustainable place relationships. Our research into cultural heritage, sustainable tourism, restoration, and renewal has had a clear impact on our approach to engaging with communities.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 IRC research had major social impact in creating a sense of belonging among Protestants and Catholics, Islanders and incomers, tourists, and local groups. We developed the concept of “Community Placemaking” to describe this work which emerged from a series of interlinked projects with a common focus on placemaking, sometimes on contested issues. Each of our three case studies facilitated discussions and provocations helped create new shared meanings/connections to heritage. Partnerships with local communities were key to all three cases studies. 

 The **Lough Neagh Landscape Partnership** \(LN\), a GBP3,500,000 Heritage Lottery Funded Cross\-Border Project 2016\-21 in Northern Ireland, created sustainable communities of place aiming to develop economic and social opportunities linked to telling new stories about contested heritage. The LN case study enabled people to engage in community archaeology, helping locals connect with the locality not just in their time but also in former times, i.e., ‘connecting with the ancestors’ 

 Given the contested nature of landscape in Northern Ireland, a powerful feature of this project was community engagement with buildings and artefacts that were previously regarded as belonging to either Protestants or Catholics, rather than shared heritage. Nic Craith and Kockel’s research on a holistic approach towards living heritage and the built environment influenced the approach of the LN project. While previously, the built environment and living heritage would be treated as separate strands, the Cultural and Built Heritage Manager, from Lough Neagh Landscape Partnership Ltd, said the research had motivated him to adopt an interconnected approach to the many strands of cultural, built and natural heritage. This generated more interconnections in public policy, including local councils in Northern Ireland which have adopted “reading the landscape” courses through the five associated council areas. Previously these would have been expert led. Now they are community\-led \[5.1\]. 

 Moreover, “Living History” classes tailored to the contested heritage of Lough Neagh were delivered to local communities. Part of this programme involved “get togethers” enabling people to “read their landscape” in a new way. Many oral histories have been collected and uploaded onto the Lough Neagh website. 

 Since it engaged local communities in the co\-creation of story mapping, the LN project has considerable impact on creativity and culture These stories included oral histories of the bog, of eel fishing and polla fishing \(unique to LN\). LN also collected stories of the World War 2 around LN and the five British and American local airfields. Stories of traditional knowledge practices concerning old sand dredging from LN have been published on\-line and are available in an open\-access *Historical Environmental and Cultural Atlas of Lough Neagh*. 

 The **New Connections Across the Northern Isles** case study \(NC\) was funded by Museums Galleries Scotland’s Museum Development Fund, the Hugh Fraser Foundation and a Scottish Graduate School for Arts and Humanities ARC Studentship. Like the LN project, it initiated a new partnership \- in this instance with Shetland Museum and Archive and the Orkney Museum, working in collaboration with Cunningsburgh History Group, the Old Haa, Orkney Historic Boat Society, and Westray Heritage Centre. Moreover, the NC project enabled a formal partnership agreement between Shetland Amenity Trust – Shetland Museum and Archives, and Orkney Islands Council – Orkney Arts, Museum and Heritage. This new partnership has enabled both organisations to establish and seek resources for additional inter\-archipelago heritage initiatives – and has created the infrastructure, and aggregate of resources for developing large scale projects and investigations 

 The NC project benefitted professionals by facilitating the launch of a community\-based maritime heritage forum, networking museums, heritage centres and history groups and societies across the Northern Isles. Twenty\-four research participants \(museum/heritage centre curators, archivists, tourism officers and marine spatial planners\) co\-curated aspects of their island group’s maritime heritages. Visitor numbers highlighted the extent of the project at Shetland Museum and Archives \(15,894\) and the Orkney Museum Kirkwall \(11,228\). Over 100 people participated in two launch conferences in Shetland and Orkney in 2019. The Virtual Museum was accessed by 5,741 people, and the Vimeo site was visited 3,821 times. The Sketchfab site has had 3,030 visits, and the Wordpress site 3,680 visits in the same period \[5.2, 5.3\]. 

 The Chair of the Orkney Historic Boat Society, has spoken about the significance of being involved in the project *:* “ *Participating in co\-curating New Connections has provided invaluable opportunities to build on our expertise for preserving historic boats; the related skills and crafts of traditional boatbuilders, and for sharing the stories of the boats they have built. We have benefited through developing curatorial skills, learning together with others concerned with the importance of maritime culture, history and heritage in the Northern Isles’* \[5.4\]. 

 Like the LN project, which collected oral histories, the NC project “collected” new creative responses to local places, including seven film shorts expressing individual, group and community engagements with a sense of place. Musicians recorded new performances and commentaries. A local artist created two new bodies of work, responding to a sense of place in Orkney and Shetland for inclusion in the ‘New Connections Across the Northern Isles’ virtual resource \[5.5\]. In 2019, the works were exhibited at Shetland Museum and Archives, the Orkney Museum the Old Haa and Yell. Films were made as a result of the research to document performance and practice of traditional maritime heritage crafts of wooden boat building in Orkney; sixern sailing in Shetland and placing of the practice of using soe pots at fishing craigs in Shetland. The virtual museum highlights the continuing heritage of making new Hardaanger fiddles in Shetland, continued by Tommy Isbister, boat builder, fiddle maker and participant in the research. 

 A direct impact of the NC project was the co\-production, with 70 participants, of the virtual museum resource ‘New Connections Across the Northern Isles’. This demonstrates the importance of maritime heritages for a sense of place in the Northern Isles. The NC project helped support Shetland’s Museum, an accredited museum that also curates a Recognised Collection \(Archaeology and Marine Archaeology\); to \(i\) raise awareness and appreciation of their Nationally Significant Collections, maximising their potential to celebrate Scotland's culture \- locally, nationally and internationally; \(ii\) to inspire and deliver new forms of access to and public engagement with the Nationally Significant Collections. Shetland Museum’s Curator of Collections, says: “ *We have been able to arrange reciprocal visits for members of museums and heritage teams between the two archipelagos and through these swaps we are discovering amazing links in the maritime heritage of both, from souvenirs and traded goods such as Skovie kapps from the Baltic and bösts from Norway, to migrations and present\-day links between fishing families in Scalloway and Westray*” \[5.3, 5.6\]. 

 Museum Galleries Scotland recognises collaborating with organisations from outside the museums and galleries sector offers development opportunities for museums and galleries, as well as bringing involvement by new groups of visitors and participants, increasing the impact of museums in communities. In their ‘Realising the Vision Together’, report \(2019\) they acknowledged the NI project harnessed collections and collections knowledge to illustrate a partnership approach to unique heritage \[5.7\]. 

 The NC project has also benefited Northern Isles schools, with Aith Junior High School, Shetland, having accessed the online museum as a useful way to consider skills for leaning, life and work. NC also gave pupils the opportunity to develop skills in the four learning capacities which are the foundation of Curriculum for Excellence: becoming successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors. The school received extremely positive feedback, including from the Education Department who have in turn shared their work with others to highlight good practice in this partnership using local heritage relevant to young learners and developing ICT skills \[5.8\]. 

 The third case study **, LeithLate** \(LL\) is a multi\-arts charity based in Leith, responsible for various public art projects and the LeithLate festival. A similar approach to the other two projects was adopted by LL which initiated \(and maintain\) productive partnerships between tourists, visual artists, local Leith communities, academics, the City of Edinburgh Council, and various funding bodies. This holistic approach highlights positive social, cultural, and economic impacts of public art projects for both tourists and locals and specifically where that art is developed \(co\-created\) in consultation with local communities. This element of co\-creation featured in all three projects. The Project report, *‘Art in and out of Lockdown’* \(2020\) noted: “We saw first\-hand the essential role that some cultural spaces play in socially and financially disadvantaged neighbourhoods that aren’t fully integrated into the city centre’s cultural scene” \[5.9\]. 

 Like the NC project, LL had a virtual dimension. LeithLate’s projects include the commission, restoration, and highlighting of artwork such as murals in Leith. LeithLate’s 2020 ‘Leith100’ programme was bookended by the *Light Up Leith History* Mural event, during which a contemporary animation was projected onto an existing mural, with a bespoke soundscape. The result was the co\-creation of a site\-specific artwork, which a total of over 1,500 locals and tourists attended over one night in February and ten nights in October. The Phoenix Choir gave performances of popular Leith songs, and a local pavement artist created new artworks alongside the mural. 

  

 The encouragement of a shared understanding was central to all of our projcts. In LL, three facilitated discussions captured conflicting meanings attached to aspirations for the mural. While some sought to restore this heritage artefact, others \(including the original artists\) wishing to see work by new artists painted over now faded sections, so highlighting community change and progress. Although these aspirations appear contradictory, both seek to honour the mural as something of continued value for locals and visitors alike. Discussion and consultation will continue towards the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the mural in 2025. 

  

 Recognising the often\-transitory nature of public art and creative spaces internationally. LL has also undertaken a dynamic archival project in the form of a Virtual Mural Tour and Virtual Open Studios map. Made in collaboration with the Culture & Community Mapping Project, the map affords free, inclusive access to high resolution imagery, video, and transcribed audio to guide the user through Leith’s various murals and creative spaces. The project employed a range of artists, software developers, designers, a tour guide and an events producer to preserve the current and past creative landscape of Leith, and can be easily augmented to include future art and spaces \[5.10\]. 

 While all three case\-studies took place in different settings \(rural, island and urban\), both across the UK and internationally, together they illustrate the importance of fostering dialogue for the co\-creation of new shared spaces. Without the input of all stakeholders, a consensus on community placemaking would not have been achieved, and opportunities for the co\-production of a range of oral, visual, textual and musical creative outputs, both tangible and virtual, would have been lost.

A model was tested using a sample of 538 Iranian visitors to Mecca for the purpose of Umrah. The result from the structural model suggests that destination attributes influence perceived destination image. Further, such tourists are likely to revisit or recommend Islamic destinations if their experience matches their perceived image of the destination. This implies that, while the religious characteristics of the destination remain important, destination managers cannot disregard the tangential, non-religious attributes of a destination which are crucial in order to satisfy more conventional tourist desires. As such, this study suggests that those managing religious travel destinations should endeavour to foster a welcoming image, where experience, interaction, and tolerance are at the forefront of the destination’s offering.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Martin Joseph', 'last_name': 'Gannon', 'initials': None, 'researcher_id': 'ur.010074602721.13', 'grid_ids': array(['grid.11984.35'], dtype=object), 'orcid': array(['0000-0001-9971-3382'], dtype=object), 'corresponding': False, 'raw_affiliations': array(['Strathclyde Business School, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK'],\n       dtype=object), 'affiliations_address': array([{'grid_id': 'grid.11984.35', 'city_id': 2648579, 'state_code': None, 'country_code': 'GB', 'raw_affiliation': 'Strathclyde Business School, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK'}],\n       dtype=object)}\n {'first_name': 'Ian W.

challenges associated with the production of a year-long cultural programme in a culturally and politically divided place. Given that Northern Ireland’s second largest city has been understood in terms of a conflict between ‘two traditions’, Irish/Catholic and British/Protestant, we critically assess the dialogue and policy negotiations with reference to public places as well as representations of collective memory and traditional music during the year. Fieldwork over two years has enabled us to investigate how culture and identity politics are played out in the context of a city undergoing a process of reconciliation. Placing our case study in a strongly comparative context, we argue that cultural concerns are pivotal points of (re-)negotiation in any society transitioning from conflict to ‘peace’ and that this issue, therefore, is of vital concern to academics and policymakers alike internationally.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Philip', 'last_name': 'McDermott', 'initials': None,

<p>Research on historic landscapes, particularly the use of a new context-based and non-site approach to the management of landscape heritage, influenced how a number of institutions created policy and implemented guidelines for practice around the world. This included providing an official method for the environmental assessment of all new major roads in the UK 2007-2019, and for projects like High Speed 2 (HS2) and airport expansions. Local authorities like Historic England, the Marine Management Organisation, and Natural England have used research datasets to inform planning for heritage management. Related guidelines have been developed in many other countries, including Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, and Turkey. This has been reinforced through tailored training for early-career landscape professionals, enabling these heritage protection practices to be implemented in Brazil, China, Italy, Spain, and Turkey.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Phytate in animal feed impairs the growth and sustainable production of poultry. Consequently, phytases \- enzymes that degrade phytate \- are added to 95% of commercial poultry feeds across the globe. **Brearley**’s research on how phytases affect phytates has impacted the animal feed industry on a global scale. This has been achieved by direct intervention and via knowledge transfer to AB Vista, a UK animal nutrition technology company. **Brearley**’s research has changed AB Vista’s R&D strategy, know\-how, marketing behaviour and technology adoption, enabling AB Vista to become one of the three largest animal feed enzyme suppliers in the world. Overall, this impact and its knock\-on effects have benefited an industry sector producing more than 10 billion chickens per year \- approximately 17% of global production – in a multibillion\-dollar enzyme market. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 
Phytate, a component of animal feed, is a potent anti\-nutrient that is estimated to cost the global poultry industry USD2,000,000,000 \(05\-2014\) per year in lost growth performance. Feed supplements that contain phytases aid digestive degradation of phytate, improve mineral, protein and amino acid digestibility, and release phosphate, which is essential for bone development. They therefore strongly improve animal growth. 

 Since the first commercial phytase was released to market in the late 1990s, phytases have become essential components of commercial poultry and pig feeds. However, until 2014, the benefits of phytase to poultry growth performance were thought to lie predominantly with degradation of phytate, also known as inositol hexakisphosphate, to lower inositol phosphates. This interpretation came from animal feed trials in which growth performance was enhanced by phytase. But, at that point, few studies had considered the detailed mechanism of phytate degradation or its interaction with animal performance. 

 <ins> *Elucidating</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>mechanism</ins> <ins>of</ins> <ins>phytase</ins> <ins></ins><ins>\(Quantum Blue\)</ins> <ins>action</ins> <ins></ins><ins>in partnership with AB Vista*</ins>: In 2012, AB Vista's Research Director and team approached **Brearley** to contract him to conduct consultancy/contract research with the purpose of providing scientific guidance and a mechanistic explanation for the company's dosing strategy when including phytase in poultry feeds. They also invited him to give a Plenary Talk at the AB Vista\-sponsored 2<sup>nd</sup> Phytase Summit. AB Vista sought to access **Brearley’s** recognised expertise in inositol phosphate and phytase research \[R1, R2\] because AB Vista lacked the expertise to undertake analysis of inositol phosphates themselves. The specific questions for which answers were sought were: in what part of the digestive tract does phytate digestion occur, how is this affected by phytase dose, and how does growth performance of monogastric animals \(poultry and pig\) correlate with individual inositol phosphates produced in different parts of the gut? AB Vista's approach was timely because the company had just launched its new phytase product Quantum Blue, and **Brearley** had developed 2d\-HPLC \(High Performance Liquid Chromatography\) pulsed amperometry methods suitable for measurement of inositol, the ultimate product of degradation of phytate \(research later published as \[R3\]\). At the time, the industry had noticed that incremental increases in animal performance could be obtained by increasing doses of phytase. These increases surpassed those attainable by supplementation of diet with phosphate. These so\-called ""extra\-phosphoric"" effects became known as ""Superdosing"", a term coined by AB Vista \(Walk CL et al. 2013. *Poultry Science* 92: 719\-725. DOI: 10.3382/ps.2012\-02727\), even if the explanation for how exactly they worked eluded the industry. 

 <ins> *The role of inositol*</ins>: Since 2013, **Brearley** has worked with AB Vista on its Quantum Blue product to determine the optimal dosing regimen of phytase for animal production. **Brearley** recognised and reported to AB Vista that the real value of Superdosing was likely to stem from the release of inositol, historically considered a vitamin. He confirmed this, providing AB Vista with analytical data that were published by the company as their first report of the effect of Superdosing with phytase \(Quantum Blue\) on measured inositol release and its correlation with growth performance in poultry \[S2\]. **Brearley** also led the development of robust, sensitive methods of measurement of inositol phosphates \(isomers\) and inositol. These have been applied to feed trials of standard and Superdoses of phytase, using samples of feed and gut contents from different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. The work has been funded directly by AB Vista \[Grant A\] and by a joint BBSRC grant with AB Vista \[Grant B\]. 

 <ins> *Global</ins> <ins>developments of the Brearley/AB Vista partnership*</ins>: The shift in attention from inositol phosphates and phosphate release to inositol as an explanation of Superdosing efficacy has been transformative for AB Vista. For example, because **Brearley** further refined his methods, making them suitable for measurement of inositol in plasma \[R3\] and animal tissue \[R4, R5\], AB Vista commissioned additional feed trials conducted by other contractors on four continents. These trials collected plasma and tissue samples from poultry and pigs \(beside feed and digesta\) for inositol analysis by **Brearley** under contract to AB Vista \[R3, R5; S1\]. 

 **Brearley** also partnered the wider AB Vista group \(AB Enzymes, Germany, and Roal Oy, Finland\) with BBSRC in pursuit of next\-generation phytases \[Grant C\]. This project arose directly from **Brearley**’s earlier discovery of a new class of phytase \[R2\] and led to a PhD studentship funded by AB Vista, one of six PhD studentships supervised by **Brearley** with funding solely from AB Vista or from AB Vista jointly with BBSRC or NERC \[S1\]. Overall, **Brearley’s** research is reported in more than twenty research outputs with AB Vista authors or co\-authors \(including \[R4\-R6\]; see also \[S1\-S3\]\). This body of work has further provided valuable information to AB Vista and the wider poultry industry on the relationship of inositol to the causes of two muscle diseases of chicken, ""Woody Breast"" and ""White Striping"" \[R5\]. These pathologies are responsible for losses of more than USD200,000,000 \(10\-2017\) per year to the poultry industry in the USA. The role of phytase and inositol release in the amelioration of these pathologies are, as a result of **Brearley**’s research, subjects of intense current interest within AB Vista \[S1\] and other feed companies.

 4. Details of the impact 

 **Brearley**'s research has had impacts on commerce, the economy and production, both directly and via knowledge transfer. The beneficiaries are commercial animal feed businesses on a global scale, specifically AB Vista and its partner companies, AB Enzymes, Germany, and Roal Oy, Finland, who produce the Quantum Blue enzyme. His research has also benefited other enzyme companies and the global poultry industry \(both producers and nutritionists\). As illustration, because of **Brearley**’s work with AB Vista, the term ""Superdosing"" has come to convey the benefits arising from provision of inositol through adding phytase to animal feed. As such, it has been accepted as a standard term in academia and industry, with more than 570 citations in Google Scholar since 2013. 

 <ins> *Change in industry R&D</ins> <ins>strategy*</ins>: **Brearley’s** research \[R3\-R6\] and his collaboration with AB Vista \[S1\] have driven a key change in AB Vista's R&D strategy. This has involved the company shifting its R&D focus towards understanding the role of inositol \[S1\-S3\], as evidenced by: AB Vista’s funding of **Brearley’s** consultancy contract \[Grant A\]; the company’s collaboration with **Brearley** in obtaining BBSRC LINK and Industrial Partnership Award funding \[Grants B, C\]; and the company’s funding of multiple PhD studentships both at UEA and internationally \[S1\]. In addition, AB Vista has commissioned research feed trials in 15 countries across four continents \(e.g. Australia, India, USA, Germany, UK\), from which it has sent samples to **Brearley** at UEA for analysis of inositol phosphate and inositol products of phytate degradation \[R3\-R5; S1\-S2\]. Overall, the involvement of **Brearley** has been a disruptive innovation for the industry's R&D. As AB Vista's Research Director stated, *“By providing us with a first set of measurements of inositol in a digestive setting, something we had not considered ourselves, Charles opened up a new research area across the animal feed industry.* *This has been very significant for AB Vista and the industry as a whole”* \[S1\]. 

 <ins> *Change in industry</ins> <ins>know\-how*</ins>: The metadata arising from analysis by **Brearley** of more than 10,000 samples from the AB Vista\-commissioned feed trials have, by providing essential scientific underpinning, reshaped AB Vista's understanding of the Quantum Blue phytase and the benefits to be gained by Superdosing. To quote AB Vista's Research Director \[S1\], *“Charles’ work on inositol and Superdosing has allowed us to progress from an understanding of the correlation of animal growth performance to inositol phosphate release, in different parts of the gut, to a sophisticated understanding of the extent of animal growth performance attributable to inositol”* \[S1\]. 

 <ins> *Change in industry behaviour: marketing*</ins>: AB Vista’s guidance on dosing of Quantum Blue has also been changed. The guidance to customers covers the range of poultry\-raising regimes used worldwide for all the chickens \(over 10,000,000,000 birds\) fed AB Vista’s phytase products. *“Our advertising strategy includes evidence generated by UEA showing that our products function at the intestinal level better than all other phytases, and the data generated enables us to explain why superdosing, for example, works in poultry and swine from a mechanistic viewpoint”* \(AB Vista's Research Director \[S1\]\). **Brearley**’s data are also reported across AB Vista’s web pages \[S3\]. 

 <ins> *Change in industry behaviour: technology adoption and knowledge transfer*</ins>: **Brearley**’s interaction with AB Vista has led to the company adopting his analytical methods. To quote AB Vista's Research Director \[S1\] *“His analytical expertise with inositol phosphates and inositol has provided a route to analysis that was not available to us before on a scale relevant to our needs. In order to be able to respond rapidly to industry needs, we are now investing heavily in Charles’ methodologies in our analytical services division in the UK”*.  Separately, **Brearley** has provided training in analytical methods to AB Enzymes \(a market leader as reflected in their turnover exceeding USD112,000,000 \(08/2019\)\), partner on Grants A\-C. This allowed for new methods to be adopted by the R&D department of AB Enzymes and in turn led to AB Enzymes testing novel applications of Quantum Blue \[S4\]. In addition, **Brearley** has transferred data on novel phytases for further investigation to Roal Oy, partner via AB Vista on Grant C. 

 <ins> *Company success*</ins>: The changes in R&D, know\-how and marketing, all arising from the new understanding of AB Vista’s Quantum Blue phytase provided by **Brearley**'s research, have enabled AB Vista to sell more of its product.  This has been achieved by advertisement of the efficiency of Quantum Blue in degrading phytate and releasing inositol \[S3\]: *“The credibility that UEA research brings to our products means that customers who are at the forefront of technology are far more likely to buy from us, …Charles’ analysis of inositol phosphates and inositol, his further development of methods suitable for tissues and organs and his interaction with our other academic partners contributes to our literature, presentations and conferences, informing existing customers regarding their use of our products, and keeping them abreast of technological developments”* \(AB Vista's Research Director \[S1\]\). **Brearley’s** research has therefore been central to AB Vista’s growth to become a top three supplier of phytase \[S1, S5\], in a market projected to exceed USD2,000,000,000 \(11\-2019\) by 2024. *“I can confirm that the research undertaken at UEA has enabled AB Vista to move from being the 6\-7<sup>th</sup> largest enzyme supplier in the world to number 2\-3 in the last seven years”* \(AB Vista's Research Director \[S1\]\). 

 <ins> *Benefiting the global poultry</ins> <ins>and pig</ins> <ins>industry*</ins>: The impact of **Brearley’s** work extends beyond AB Vista to its customers and competitors in the poultry and pig sectors. For example, industry\-wide adoption of Superdosing and the contribution of inositol to this technique is evidenced in a competitor’s 2017 marketing presentation, which stated, ‘ *Use of Ronozyme® HiPhos increases blood levels of myo\-inositol by a quick break\-down of phytate in the gut*’ \[S6\]. Moreover, phytase sales benefit customers as well as producers. AB Vista’s Global Sales Director has quantified the value of phytate degradation to customers, "" *Estimates suggest the anti\-nutritional effects of phytate could be costing the industry as much as €2 billion* \[EUR2,000,000,000 \(05/2014\)\] *per year in lost performance, and that the potential still to be captured from near\-complete phytate destruction* *is as high as €5* \[EUR5.00 \(05\-2014\)\] *per tonne of feed manufactured”* \[S7\] *.* Lastly, **Brearley**'s research on the role of inositol in the aetiology of two muscle diseases in chicken, ""Woody Breast"" and ""White Striping"" \[R5\], hold potential for substantial future benefits to the industry. As AB Vista's Research Director has stated of **Brearley**'s presentation of this work to an industry conference in Taiwan in 2019, *""The event in Taiwan helped more than one hundred participants… The sales increment could be substantial if we find that dosing two to three times higher than current 'superdosing' norms prove beneficial""* \[S1\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our research and evidence\-based interventions have shaped how UK policymakers, educational institutions and safeguarding professionals are tackling and preventing online harassment in student communities. Key findings from our research have informed recommendations to the Office for Students about how universities can actively work to tackle and prevent online harassment among students. Subsequently, our interventions have been identified as examples of best practice in national guidance from Universities UK to the higher education sector and have led to changes in professional practices in universities, schools and law enforcement agencies across England, which include new safeguarding initiatives to mitigate online harassment in these contexts. At local levels, follow up surveys have shown these new initiatives have begun to de\-normalise online harassment among students, fostering a greater willingness by students to report online harassment to their educational institutions. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The \#Speakout research project was developed in response to national\-level calls for evidence\-based interventions and training resources to effectively tackle the increasing prevalence of online harassment among students on UK university campuses. Key findings from Universities UK’s \(UUK\)  [Changing the Culture](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Pages/changing-the-culture-final-report.aspx) report \(2016\), found that online harassment among UK university students is widespread, and digitised spaces are often a conduit for hate crimes, including those that target an individual’s race, gender and sexual orientation. To address these issues, the Higher Education Funding Council for England \(now the Office for Students – OfS\) offered competitive funding to universities who could develop innovative approaches to tackling online harassment including safeguarding initiatives to mitigate these practices, which created a network of higher education institutions collectively focused on this common goal. Led by Dr Craig Haslop in the Department of Communication and Media, the University of Liverpool \(UoL\) developed a successful bid for this funding through the \#Speakout project, which demonstrated how research can be used to tackle and prevent online harassment at UoL via evidence\-based interventions and training resources that can be adapted for use in other educational contexts. 

 The project builds on the Department’s growing reputation as a centre for the study of online harassment, through an emerging body of research. Dr Haslop and Dr Southern have both conducted research that explores links between online affordances and social inclusion/exclusion \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3\), which seeks to build an understanding of the issue in different contexts and develop strategies to help online users understand, navigate and respond appropriately to these experiences. Dr O’ Rourke’s research has examined how social inequalities in England, particularly those structured by race and gender, can be tackled in pedagogic spaces through research\-informed interventions. 

 Research for the \#Speakout project, so\-called because it wanted to give students an opportunity to speak out about their experiences, further built on this body of research by critically examining online harassment in student’s peer groups at UoL and exploring the extent to which these practices reflect social inequalities in the broader social context \(3.4\). This research was then used to develop interventions and resources to tackle and prevent these practices in educational contexts at the local, regional and national level, including secondary schools, where norms around online harassment are often established \(3.4\). 

 Conducted between December 2017 and March 2019, our project comprised four phases which aimed to: 1\) conduct research; 2\) identify priority issues on the University campus; 3\) develop and conduct interventions; and 4\) evaluate their impact on the student population. The following summarises the research phase of the project. 

 The research phase of our project critically examined the extent and nature of online harassment in peer\-to\-peer interactions between students at UoL, their perceptions of and attitudes to these practices, their willingness to report these incidents to the University and their knowledge of how to do so. To address these research concerns, a mixed research methodology was employed, combining a web\-based benchmark survey of 795 students, and 15 student interviews. Key findings from the research phase included: 

 Harassment is so prevalent in online spaces, it is often perceived to be the ‘norm’ by students \(3.4\). For example, over 50% of students who responded to our survey believed that specific forms of online harassment, such as abusive comments and non\-consensual sharing of personal information, were likely to happen in interactions with their peers \(3.4\). 

 21.94% of students reported that they had personally experienced online harassment and 5% thought they might have \(3.4\). 

 Online harassment can have adverse effects on respondent’s health, wellbeing and educational experience \(3.5\). 

 7.90% more female, than male students, reported they had experienced online harassment, and women are more likely to have encountered its sexualised forms, such as unwanted sexual comments in online spaces \(3.5\). 

 70.90% of transgender students reported they had experienced online harassment, suggesting they are substantially more likely to be harassed online, than their cis\-gender counterparts \(3.6\). 

 Significant numbers of students had a relatively low willingness to report gendered forms of online harassment to the University and/or student’s union, particularly online abuse that was directed at women \(3.6\). 

 Based on these findings our team developed, evaluated and implemented a series of interventions designed to tackle and prevent online harassment among students. These are outlined in section 4, along with their subsequent impacts.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research and evidence\-based interventions have shaped efforts by UK policymakers, educational institutions and safeguarding professionals to tackle and prevent online harassment among students. As a consequence, our research has created impact across the education sector at national, regional and local levels in three key areas: *4.1\) Shaping UK higher education sector recommendations and guidance; 4.2\) Changing safeguarding and professional practices across the educational sector; and 4.3\) De\-normalising online harassment among students at the University of Liverpool.* 

 4.1 Shaping UK higher education sector recommendations and guidance 

 Our research has informed higher education \(HE\) sector wide policy recommendations and guidance on tackling and preventing online harassment within student communities, which has resulted in the following contributions to the sector’s response: 

 a\) Our findings were used by **Advance HE** in their report to the **Office for Students** \(OfS\), which evaluated the OfS funded projects’ approaches to tackling and preventing online harassment among student populations and made recommendations to the UK HE sector \(5.1, report p. 28\). This report included our research finding that online harassment was normalised among students, which in turn led directly to their research informed conclusions and sector wide recommendations for action.  The lead author of the **Advance HE** report said: ‘We included a substantive extract from the \[…\] team’s final report \[…\] to support this conclusion’ \(5.1, testimonial\).  Based on this conclusion, **Universities UK** recommended that universities ‘facilitate students to recognise and challenge these normalised behaviours’ \(5.2, report p.6\) in their national guidance which outlined how the UK HE sector can actively work to tackle and prevent online harassment **.** 

 b\) **UUK** identified our project and its evidence\-based interventions as an example of best practice in their sector wide guidance to universities, which outlined effective ways of mitigating online harassment within student communities \(5.2, case studies p.14\). The lead author of the guidance explains why the project was included: ‘One of the reasons why UUK has chosen to highlight \#Speakout…is that the project was clearly informed by primary research gathered from the University of Liverpool’s cohort of students \[…\]. Additionally, the project’s impact assessment found promising results indicating a positive change in students’ critical awareness of online harassment \[…\]’ \(5.2 testimonial\). 

 c\) Our project has shaped **UUK**’s response to the increase in domestic violence and technology mediated abuse within student communities, which has been exacerbated by the increased need for digital social interaction during the COVID\-19 pandemic \(5.3 report\). Findings from our research informed the scope of their national guidance briefing document to the UK HE sector \(5.3 report\).  Writing about our unique contributions to this briefing, the Policy Manager at UUK notes the \#Speakout research highlighted ‘that it \[online domestic violence and abuse\] can take place between students in a number of settings, that include halls of residence and private shared accommodation, as well as between family and intimate partners in more traditional home environments’. She continues: ‘\[these\] contributions worked to broaden our working definition of domestic abuse \[…\] and our subsequent framing of university\-based interventions \[…\] to tackle and prevent these practices within university communities’ \(5.3 testimonial\). 

 4.2 Changing safeguarding and professional practices across the educational sector 

 Our research and evidence\-based resources have instigated new safeguarding initiatives to tackle and prevent online harassment among students in universities, secondary schools and law enforcement agencies across England, changing professional practices in these contexts. This includes the adoption of our student\-centred online training module titled ‘Developing a Positive Online Presence’. 

 \- The University of Manchester have revised their induction programme for students to address online harassment in direct response to our findings and have embedded our online module into their welcome week programme. Writing about this progressive change in their professional practices, UoM’s Sexual Violence and Response Manager states: ‘The module represents the first safeguarding initiative at the University of Manchester that aims to mitigate online harassment among students on our campus’. She continues: ‘one of the most valuable aspects of the module is that it encourages students to think about consent in an online setting \[…\] there are few resources available that challenge university students to think about \[…\] consent within a digital context’ \(5.4\). 

 \- The University of Leicester \(UoLeic\) have integrated our online module into their ‘ [Standing Together’](https://le.ac.uk/about/equality/standing-together/training) student training programme, which previously focused only on physical forms of harassment, representing their first institution wide initiative to address online harassment among students. Writing about why UoLeic adopted the module, their Wellbeing Case Manager and Standing Together Lead says: ‘one of the strengths of the module is that it aims to educate students about how to use online technologies in a safe, civil and considered way, rather than simply telling them what ‘not to do’\[…\]’ \(5.4\). The normalisation of online harassment highlighted by our research \(Haslop and O’Rourke, 2020, see 3.5\), means students often do not recognise the need to raise their own critical awareness of the subject. The module engages students by highlighting the benefits of understanding online harassment as part of developing their online presence, which can enhance their long\-term career prospects. 

 \- Merseyside Police have adopted our module and changed their pedagogic approach to their ‘Safer Schools Programme’, which works to keep young people safe and prevent them from becoming involved in crime. Like universities, schools and law enforcement agencies that work with them, often lack the resources to help young people raise their critical awareness of online harassment. As Merseyside Police’s Youth Engagement officer explains: ‘…within schools – staff recognise there is a problem but lack the expertise to tackle and prevent online harassment \[…\]’. ‘The resource’s focus on young people’s experiences makes its content very relevant to school students, making it easier \[for police officers\] to engage them in the training’. She continues: ‘\[The module\] has helped us change the ethos of delivery from one where we stand up and tell \[young people\] what they are doing wrong and they must not do it again, to one where we allow them to recognise their own behaviours and to take steps to change those behaviours’ \(5.5\). 

 \- The Independent Schools Association, which represents 550 independent schools across the UK, have recommended our student training module to its members, following a successful trial at **Scarisbrick Hall School** in Ormskirk, Liverpool. While tackling online harassment among student populations was already a priority for schools, the COVID\-19 pandemic has intensified the need to address the problem. As the Headmaster of Scarisbrick Hall School and Chair of the Independent Schools Association notes: ‘\[D\]ue to the lockdown restrictions \[…\] across the sector we have seen a rise in risks connected to online harassment, exploitation and peer pressures’. He continues: ‘\[a\]s a school it has been encouraging to see the impact that the module has had on pupils \[…\] staff have \[…\] commented that following \[completion of\] the module students asked more profound questions about online behaviours’ \(5.6\). 

 4.3 Denormalising online harassment among students at the University of Liverpool \(UoL\) 

 Our research and its evidence\-based interventions have changed professional practices and safeguarding initiatives at UoL, leading to a positive shift towards the denormalisation of online harassment among students \(5.7 p109\). This shift included a change in attitudes among students to reporting gendered forms of online harassment which, based on our research, were identified as an intervention priority at UoL. For example, before our evidence\-based interventions, we asked how students would respond if they observed a peer directing abusive online comments at a female student expressing her views about feminism. In the benchmark survey, 44.17% said they would report, which increased to 65.5% in a follow up survey conducted three months after our interventions \(5.7, p106\). 

 These changes were seen after three key interventions developed by our team and conducted in collaboration with the Liverpool Guild of Students \(the student’s union at UoL known as ‘The Guild’\), Sport Liverpool \(UoL’s sports and fitness centre\), and UoL’s Student Support Services: 

 a\) Our findings changed an established bystander intervention programme at UoL, which had previously focused on how students can safely respond or intervene to incidents of physical sexual harassment and had not addressed its online forms. After taking the training, 89% of students surveyed felt ‘better equipped with the skills necessary to respond appropriately to online harassment’ \(5.8\). 

 b\) The Guild’s senior management drew on our research to adapt an annual campus\-wide awareness campaign, titled  [‘\#Call it Out’](https://www.liverpoolguild.org/call-it-out) . Previously, their campaign had focused exclusively on raising awareness of physical forms of sexual harassment and had not addressed its online forms. The Vice President and the Director of Membership Services for The Guild notes: ‘The data and research on online harassment helped us understand the prevalence of the issue, and the disproportionate way in which specific groups are targeted’ \(5.8\). 

 c\) Using insights from our research, our team developed a new  [online information hub](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/studentsupport/reportandsupport/onlineharassment/) about online harassment for UoL students, which has been viewed 990 times since its creation in March 2019 \(5.9\). The \#Speakout research identified a lack of knowledge among students about how to report online harassment to the University. The new web pages addressed this by providing information about behaviours that constitute online harassment and how to report them. 

 **In summary**, our research has impacted the higher education and secondary schools’ sectors with beneficiaries including: policymakers, in their development of relevant national guidance to universities about effective approaches to tackle and prevent online harassment; educational and safeguarding professionals, who have used our research to implement new initiatives to mitigate online harms; and young people, who have become more critically aware of online harassment. As our evidence\-based resources continue to be rolled out to secondary schools and universities across the UK, we anticipate they will have ongoing impact in these contexts.

It takes a mixed-methods approach to analyzing 117,802 tweets sent to MPs over a 14-day period for evidence of incivility. Firstly, models assessing the factors associated with receiving incivility on Twitter are presented, and furthermore, an in-depth thematic analysis of gendered tweets is conducted. The findings suggest that for the receipt of certain types of incivility, there is little difference between female and male MPs. However, female MPs were more likely to receive generally uncivil tweets, tweets with stereotypes about their identity, and tweets questioning their position as politicians than male MPs.

This article challenges this discourse by drawing on findings from a large-scale study ( N = 810) conducted on a university campus in England that critically examined student’s perceptions of and attitudes to different forms of online harassment, including abusive, offensive and harassing communications, using survey and interview data. Key findings indicate that online harassment is so pervasive in digitised spaces that it is often viewed as the ‘norm’ by the student population who appear willing to tolerate it, rather than take actions to address it, which challenges pejorative claims that they are intolerant and easily offended ‘snowflakes’. Respondents who identify as female and transgender are more likely to be targeted by online harassment. We argue that the label ‘snowflake generation’ is diverting attention away from student’s everyday experiences of online harassment and its adverse effects, particularly on women and transgendered people, which has the potential to create a gender-related digital divide (Jane, 2018).

<p>This research into how criminal justice practitioners and service providers in the UK can support victims-survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) leveraged over £7.2 million in funding to expand a GBV-prevention programme in the UK. This program is shown to reduce abuse by high-risk perpetrators by up to 88% and underpinned new UK family court guidance to protect children from domestic abuse.

<h6>Advances in the Neuroscience of Trauma & Crime: Transforming justice globally for vulnerable people in custody</h6>
<p>Research uncovered that 42,000 people currently in UK prisons have some form of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), which is associated with impulsivity and problems in social reasoning. This finding changed judicial and health policies in the UK and (those endorsed by the UN) UN to take account of TBI and Neurodisability. It also led to changes in practice across the prison system impacting 83,000 existing prisoners and 60,00 new entrants each year, including mandatory neurodisability screening and enhanced support and staff training.

<h6>Designing out Crime: Improving police and planning policy and practice to reduce crime and create safer communities</h6>
<p>Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) creates housing developments that are less vulnerable to crime, with housing built to Secured by Design (SBD) standards that experience 55% less burglary. This changed government planning guidance and building regulations in the UK and the United Arab Emirates and increased the number of secure homes (44% of new homes built between 2013 and 2017 were SBD), which reduced crime and increased feelings of safety.

<p>Evidence-based interventions in the prison service have shown that behaviour monitoring can predict risk of reoffending after release and that digital technology terminals (for prisoners to request visits, access health care, order food, etc.) bring significant behavioural benefits and enhance rehabilitation within prisons. Enhanced Behaviour Monitoring was made mandatory in all pre-release prisons and funding of £7,000,000 for the introduction of digital kiosks in UK prisons was announced.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Previous perceptions of Wales as ‘unknown’ and ‘invisible’ in European travel writing were transformed by Swansea research which uncovered continental Europeans’ views of Wales since 1750. Sharing these findings with new regional, national and international audiences in education, heritage, creative practice and cultural policy led to numerous benefits. These included changes in pedagogical practices, enhanced understandings of European perspectives and refugee artists’ representations of Wales, and the creation of new, multilingual literary works on Wales. Jones collaborated with stakeholders to develop digital heritage research tools, educational resources, and creative writing that informed national policy initiatives valuing ethically informed citizenship and cultural diversity.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **European Travellers to Wales: 1750\-2010* \[ETW\] is a **collaborative research project** by Bangor University \(PI Prof Carol Tully\), Swansea University \(CoI Dr Kathryn Jones\) and the Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies \(CoI Dr Heather Williams\). The major AHRC project \(£420,000\) investigates the representation of Wales and ‘Welshness’ in texts by European travellers from 1750 to the present day \[R1, R3, R4\], deploying Jones’s expertise in Breton, French and German culture and history from the late 19th to the 21st century. 

 Working in archives across Europe, the team **unearthed a rich corpus** of over 500 previously undiscovered accounts of travel to Wales written in 15 languages, and a further 450 guidebooks in French, German and Dutch \[R5\]. A **digital database** \[R2\] maps each journey and users can search for traits including periods, destinations, nationalities, and reasons for travel. This **original contribution to** **Wales Studies** makes international perceptions of Wales newly available in select translations. This study of a smaller nation hitherto minoritised within travel writing studies is paradigmatic for investigating the evolving perceptions of less historically ‘visible’ nations, e.g. Brittany, Catalonia. *The Times Higher Education* \[23/02/2017\] commended the **innovative approach** of using the prism of **Modern Languages\-based research** in the field of **Celtic Studies**, ‘demonstrating how modern languages increasingly help us to understand our own culture’. 

 Our research investigated travellers who found a haven in Wales as a result of socio\-political events, revealing that refugees and exiles to Wales from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century tended to leave visual rather than textual traces behind of their host nation \[R1\]. Thus, artworks by influential refugee and exiled artists showing their impressions of the Welsh landscape and people featured prominently in the project’s exhibition **EuroVisions of Wales**. Educational booklets, adult learners’ and primary school workshops on refugee artists in Wales \(led by Jones\) were designed to disseminate the research in accessible forms and **raise awareness of the experiences of refugees and exiles past and present in Wales.** 

 The **co\-authored monograph **Hidden Texts, Hidden Nation** is the first full\-length study of European travel writing on Wales \[R1\], illustrating the interplay between identity and hegemony and the dynamics of intercultural relations and representation: Wales has been discovered, lost, then rediscovered. Jones’s research revealed that Wales was only treated on its own terms in European travel writing in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, beginning with French accounts of the 1904\-05 religious Revival. She discovered how prevalent 19th\-century European perceptions of Wales as a bastion of both Celtic tradition and modern industry re\-emerged in more fragmented sensory, physical and consumerist forms at the dawn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. As Jones’s articles in the first\-ever **journal special issue** on travel writing and Wales show \[R3, R4\], diverse approaches to heritage and ethnic tourism result in polarised present\-day perspectives and imply a new political awareness of post\-devolution Wales. 

 Jones’s closing chapter to the monograph also draws on **new travelogues on Wales** that she commissioned from exiled authors from Turkey \(Meltem Arikan\) and former Yugoslavia \(Edin Suljic\), and international writers visiting Wales from Germany \(Jörg Bernig\) and France \(world\-renowned writer Marie Darrieussecq\) \[C8\]. These representations show that despite the greater visibility and accessibility of Wales, paradoxically it also remains peripheral: The Romantic evocation of Wales as a spiritual haven finds a counterpart in the 21st century, with the recurring portrayal of an ex\-centric/eccentric place of refuge and respite. Contemporary Wales still serves as a cultural\-political role model for Brittany, demonstrating the possibility for travellers from smaller nations to circumvent the centre in their accounts of travel to minoritized nations and cultures.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Enhancing awareness, understanding and educational practices** 

 **Educational beneficiaries** encompass primary school pupils and teachers, a pioneering Welsh\-government secondary schools’ network and adult learners. Swansea’s outreach work led to **increased awareness,** understanding and **changed educational practices**. These new resources and perspectives inform **national policy initiatives** valuing ethically informed citizenship and cultural diversity, and have **changed understandings** of Wales’s relationship with Europe and the experiences of refugees and exiles. Our research also has **global reach**: beneficiaries of our database \[R2\] span **6 continents and 70 countries**, and international HEIs have adopted it as a research tool \(e.g. a Leipzig University postgraduate course on ‘Wales in Travel Writing’\) \[C1\]. 

 The research project co\-created two **bilingual activity e\-books** for Key Stages 2 and 3 on **‘Refugees to Wales’** with the National Library of Wales’s Education unit \[C2\]. Published on Hwb \(Welsh Government Digital Learning e\-platform\) since November 2015, they have been viewed \(an above average\) more than 1300 times to date. The resources are recommended for school use by the Welsh Government working group on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Communities, Contributions and Cynefin in the New Curriculum \[C2\]. 

 The e\-books formed the basis of workshops with 284 Year 3\-6 primary school pupils in Welsh and English in Swansea, Llanelli, Brecon and Carmarthen led by Jones and Dr Aled Rees \(Swansea University\). The workshops **increased awareness and enhanced understanding** about the experiences of refugees in Wales past and present. ‘I learned that people come to Wales from all over the world because of Wars’ \[Year 3 pupil\]; ‘The workshop and materials fit perfectly with the core purpose of the new Welsh curriculum of **Ethical, Informed Citizens** ready to be citizens of Wales and the world’ \[Year 6 teacher\]. The workshops on refugee artists **enriched beneficiaries’ cultural lives** and impacted on teaching practice. Pupils wrote on luggage tags to reflect on refugee experiences and appreciated ‘experimenting with a new style in drawing’ \[Year 6 pupil\] and learning ‘art does not have to be perfect’ \[Year 5 pupil\] by creating drawings in the style of Polish Jewish refugee painter Josef Herman \[examples below and C3\]. ‘I am going to **change my practice** and allow the children to experiment further with different resources. In philosophy sessions we will look at and compare photographs and artists' pictures/paintings’ \[Year 5 Teacher\]. 



 Teachers at the June 2019 Welsh\-government SEREN \[ [<ins>https://gov.wales/seren\-network</ins>](https://gov.wales/seren-network)\] network workshop where Jones was invited to present emphasised the value of our multilingual educational materials and digital tools for independent learning in the **New Curriculum for Wales** areas of Languages, Literacy and Communication and the Humanities. ‘It’s incredibly valuable in enhancing pupils’ understanding of their locality \[…\] and how outsiders might perceive us’; ‘perfect for ticking the boxes of the Donaldson Review’s “Four Purposes” \[ambitious capable learners; healthy, confident individuals; enterprising, creative contributors; ethical, informed citizens\]. It’s wonderful that we can benefit from such extensive and fascinating research’ \[Year 7\-13 English teacher\] \[C3\]. Teachers also identified ‘further opportunities for partnership working \[with ETW\] as our project work in the Humanities begins to embed’ \[Deputy Headteacher\] \[C3\]. 

 Jones also developed a third sector partnership with the community\-based organization **Swansea City of Sanctuary** to develop an adult learners’ public workshop during the UK\-wide *Being Human* Festival of the Humanities in 2017. This workshop brought together asylum seekers and local learners and created new mutual understandings. Attendees appreciated the ‘personal approach, getting to know individuals’ and sharing their experiences of home and belonging in Swansea \[C4\]. Regional and national press coverage provided a broader platform for engagement between asylum seekers and the wider public \[C4\]. 

 **Heritage beneficiaries** 

 Our research on travel texts and visual art benefited **museums and galleries** by generating new display content in the interactive **EuroVisions of Wales** exhibition with public talks and workshops \[C5\] which toured Ceredigion Museum, Swansea Museum and Bangor’s Storiel Gallery \[11/07/15 – 2/07/16\]. ‘Swansea Museum found participation in the project very beneficial, both in terms of audience development and broadening our knowledge about the collections we and other museums and archives hold’. ‘The exhibition helped Swansea Museum to deliver our business plan objectives for 2015 / 2016, in particular to maintain high quality exhibitions and an events programme’. ‘Events such as prominent art historian Peter Lord’s public talk on Heinz Koppel were particularly effective in raising the profile of the museum and providing a rich visitor experience’ \[C5\]. The exhibition also gave our heritage beneficiaries ‘a **new framework** to exhibit additional travel\-related items from our own collections’ \[C5\]. ‘When I heard about the exhibition, I was glad to have the chance to contribute some of the family’s private documents to a new exhibit on my mother, which raised awareness of her contribution as a refugee to Wales’ \(son of German\-Jewish refugee and Egyptologist, Swansea Museum’s Keeper of Archaeology for 25 years\) \[C5\]. 14,615 visitors viewed the exhibition at Swansea Museum \[C6\], and their responses demonstrate its socio\-cultural benefit of **enhancing public understanding** of Wales’s relationship with Europe, e.g. ‘A wonderful, inspiring exhibition – so interesting to see how we’ve been seen through European eyes, and how European culture has enriched our own’ \[C6\]. This timely research on Welsh\-European relations is of significant interest in Wales \[e.g. Jones’s interview about the exhibition for *The Arts Show*, BBC Radio Wales \[06/01/2016\]; and more widely across the UK \[BBC News online article ‘What Euro Visitors have Thought of Wales in Past 260 Years’\] \[C7\]. 

 **Inspiring creative practices** 

 The project has benefited **creative industries** and **political debate** in Wales and beyond through inspiring and commissioning new travel writing, and working with external non\-profit organisations. Partnering with **Wales PEN Cymru**, an international association which promotes literature and defends the freedom of expression of writers worldwide, Jones commissioned four exilic/visiting travelogues for the multilingual ebook **Perthyn i Gymru / Belonging to Wales** \[C8\]. The collection fosters dialogue about Wales as a destination/home for travellers and refugees today. It ‘fits perfectly with Wales PEN Cymru’s values of inclusion, diversity and equality’, and through this collaboration ‘we were able to achieve one of the organisation’s main aims – to support exiled writers’ \[C8\]. Distributed and discussed at the 2019 Hay Festival event ‘Freedom Writers: Censorship in Turkey and Exile in Wales’, it has enjoyed positive reader responses at a time when Europeans’ sense of belonging in the UK has been widely undermined by Brexit, e.g. described on Twitter as ‘my dream book’ by a Frenchwoman resident in Wales. 

 ‘The European Travellers to Wales project inspired the *Belonging to Wales* series’ in the *Welsh Agenda* magazine of the independent think tank **Institute of Welsh Affairs**, which ‘provides platforms for debate’ and ‘attracts more than 50,000 unique visitors every year’ \[C9\]. Republishing our commissioned travelogues in this **new** **major series** ‘inform\[ed\] the shape of future contributions from European nationals’, set ‘a template for other essayistic exploratory writing’, ‘further\[ed\] our own networks among exiled communities’, and ‘inspired in turn a new strand of online content “People and Places”’. ‘The early success of the “People and Places” strand has attracted sponsorship from Coastal Housing, and we aim to use this new partnership to fund further contributions from diverse, marginalised writers who would otherwise not have access to making their voices, opinions and stories heard in a high\-profile magazine’ \[C9\]. Our research has thereby given a platform to underrepresented and marginalised voices, which in turn help others, including young people, to think and act more confidently as creative, ethically informed citizens.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The last 15 years have witnessed significant change for the UK intelligence community, following the Butler Report \(2004\). This blamed flawed intelligence analysis \(the critical interpretation of information in order to forecast trends and scenarios\) for costly operational failures in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Goodman’s research has had impact relating to key recommendations from the Butler Report and the subsequent Blackett Review \(2011\). It has demonstrated how academic research knowledge and methods can bring to light new perspectives and challenge analysts’ assumptions. In particular, since 2014, impacts based on Goodman’s research as the Official Historian at the Cabinet Office, and his subsequent academic\-to\-government knowledge exchange and outreach efforts, have been conceptual \(establishing the relevance and practical utility of historical perspectives\), attitudinal \(improved dialogue and receptiveness to external expertise\), capacity\-building \(formal training\) and operational \(recommendations leading to the formation and establishment of a new national Intelligence Assessment Academy\). Goodman’s research has served to directly inform and alter practice throughout all levels of government and the intelligence community. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Goodman’s research – supported through funding by the British Academy, Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\), Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\) and the Cabinet Office – has established how the history of intelligence can be used to identify lessons of contemporary relevance and, in so doing, inform changes in practice. This includes contributing both historical\-biographical knowledge of intelligence developments, successes and failures and the ways in which methods of historical research \(data collection, documentary interpretation, source validation and the study of complex interactions and causal relationships\) can support the development of analytical tradecraft. 

#  The Official History of the Joint Intelligence Committee 

 Goodman wrote the first historical account of the way in which intelligence was used to inform foreign and defence policy \[1\]. Goodman’s work followed his appointment as Official Historian by the Prime Minister and his receipt of two Cabinet Office grants for secondments to produce the work. This post afforded him invaluable access to all relevant classified and released materials in the archives of the Cabinet Office, Number 10, Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence and other government departments, to examine records from Joint Intelligence Committee \(JIC\) Assessments and the papers of the JIC Secretariat. Archival work was supplemented by oral history, with interviews with former civil servants, diplomats and military personnel providing first\-hand accounts of how the intelligence community and its operations were perceived, interpreted and remembered. Due to the sensitive nature of both the material and personnel, such a study had never previously been achieved. The research was the first historical description of the intelligence machinery of government, the first to demonstrate the tactical role of the JIC in supporting decision\-making in operations and the first to look at its management to understand its successes and failures. *Spying on the World*, arising from a British Academy grant, further described 24 historical case studies showing the evolution of the JIC between 1936 and 2013 \[2\]. This body of research highlighted the important role of one of the least understood Whitehall committees: one which was subject to considerable scrutiny after the 2004 Butler Report and of immense public interest post\-Iraq. *The Official History of the Joint Intelligence Committee* and *Spying on the World* \[1,2\] were both featured in *The Independent* \(11 July 2014\) and the former was included in *The Spectator’s* Books of the Year list \(15 November 2014\). The researching of the *Official History* was illustrative of challenges of writing history from classified primary source material, a process reflected upon in the article ‘Writing the Official History of the Joint Intelligence Committee’ \[3\] and indicative of another arc of Goodman’s research: reflections on the researching and teaching of intelligence studies, to maximise productive engagement with practitioner and policy communities. 

#  Creating a blended approach to studying the history of intelligence 

 How the trajectory of academic intelligence studies relate to challenges in government intelligence practice: Goodman’s research has documented the emergence of intelligence studies as a distinct discipline \[4\]. This research – taking the form of a review of developments in government intelligence agencies alongside histories of course provision in UK and US higher education institutions – detailed the differing trajectories of intelligence studies on either side of the Atlantic since 1960, providing context for understanding challenges for the profession and the \(then rapidly expanding\) discipline. Having surveyed the emergence of the field, which had mainly bifurcated into History departments on the one hand and Politics departments on the other, the research advocated for a blended approach to intelligence studies that combined historical\-biographical approaches \(accounts and memoirs of specific case studies\) with more theoretical treatments of the functional, structural and political contexts in which intelligence communities operate. It also advanced academic co\-operation with agencies and practitioners to further understand the problems and methods of intelligence work. Based on ‘Teaching about intelligence’ \[4\], the Cabinet Office engaged Goodman to devise training for government intelligence staff. ‘What analysts need to understand’ \[5\] provided critical reflective research on the initiative, revealing that analysts were generally less knowledgeable than they needed to be about the history of the wider intelligence community outside their own employing agency and many implicitly use an inductivist model of their work. <ins>\[</ins>text removed for publication\] \[6\] took this further by evaluating the potential impact of academic expertise and historical perspectives on government analytical functions \(evaluating the effectiveness of AHRC\-funded knowledge exchange activities via 19 follow\-up interviews with Whitehall officials\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Goodman’s research has transformed how academic expertise is engaged with and used by the intelligence community. Previously, closed systems gave little thought to including academic insights in the analytical process. Goodman’s research thus fulfils key recommendations of the 2004 Butler Report, noted above, and the subsequent 2011 Blackett Review \(of high\-impact, low\-probability security risks\). Specifically, the research has resulted in three main changes to intelligence community practice: analysts have been brought into closer dialogue with academics and become better equipped to interpret the positive and negative lessons from intelligence history; thereby improving the effectiveness of their interpretative and technical skills; and thus increasing the professionalisation of their tradecraft nationally and internationally. 

#  Knowledge exchange and ‘lessons learned’ for contemporary practice 

 A series of grants from the AHRC \(2011–13 and 2014–16, and a King’s College London Higher Education Innovation Fund grant in 2013–14\) acted as a key impact pathway by supporting a Lessons Learned seminar series within Whitehall and <ins>\[</ins>text removed for publication that provided a structure for engagement and commissioned research in partnership with the Cabinet Office, Ministry of Defence, Foreign Office and Royal United Services Institute \(RUSI\). These focused on the historical roots of contemporary security challenges – exploring examples of good and bad analysis in order to identify process lessons, to help policymakers draw on wider research into the historical and cultural elements \[1,3\] of currently developing foreign policy situations and allow broader discussion of the historical and theoretical frameworks within which solutions are conceived \[6\]. This was important because layers of secrecy had historically ensured that the intelligence community was insulated from the world of academia and the research resources and findings it offers. According to <ins>\[</ins>text removed for publication\] \[A\] . Such activities described and refined the conditions in which to generate impact with such closed practitioner communities. 

#  **Capacity\-building for more effective interpretative skills and capability** 

 Goodman’s research on analytical challenges in historical perspective and case studies of intelligence analysis \[4\] was an important step as the Whitehall/academia relationship was still in its infancy, less than a year after the Cabinet Office appointed its first Professional Head of Intelligence Analysis. It led the incumbent, Jane Knight, to ask Goodman to devise new study materials and workshops for their analysts, with the overall aim to enhance analysis capability to enable it to work more effectively. This led to the King’s Intelligence Studies Programme, convened with Professor Sir David Omand \(Cabinet Office Security & Intelligence Co\-ordinator \(2002–05\), Home Office Permanent Secretary \(1997–2000\) and GCHQ Director \(1996–97\)\) \[5\]. The value of the Programme has been demonstrated in having analysts confront and challenge their own assumptions via specialised training in best practice from the academic community, the better to improve their abilities to assess information from familiarity with a broader range of \(academic, historic\) approaches and methods. More than 1,000 people from across government have completed the Programme and <ins>\[</ins>text removed for publication As \[B\] asserts: <ins>\[</ins>text removed for publication\] \[B\]. 

#  Increasing the professionalisation of intelligence analysis tradecraft, nationally and internationally 

 Goodman’s research has ensured the effective integration of academic expertise into the professionalisation agenda within a previously closed government system. In 2019, as part of a major change programme for the government’s intelligence community, its first ever Professional Development Framework was launched, including the need for proficiency in working with academic sources under the ‘Analysis, Tradecraft & Assessment’ technical skill \(as per \[4,5,6\] and historical briefings \(based on \[1\] and \[2\]\) are now part of analysts’ inductions: <ins>\[</ins>text removed for publication\] \[C\]. 

 In 2019, the Cabinet Office moved to create an Intelligence Assessment Academy, after earlier commitments from the National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence & Security Review had stalled \[6\]. This was a key recommendation from Goodman’s review of government\-proposed investments and the development of the profession of analysis: a dedicated intelligence analysis academy to further formalise and institutionalise academia\-practitioner links and correct the imbalance between increasing intelligence collection capabilities, on the one hand, with limited investment in the size, scope and capability of assessment capabilities, on the other. <ins>\[</ins>text removed for publication\] \[C\]. 

 Such changes in intelligence analytical standards and in academic\-practitioner collaboration have been successfully exported internationally. The Norwegian Defence Intelligence School in Oslo \(where Goodman has been a Visiting Professor since 2015\) introduced professional intelligence education based on his approach in 2014. Goodman’s research and approaches to training analysts have been influential across <ins>\[</ins>text removed for publication\] \[5,D\]. Goodman received invitations to the Bundesnachrichtendienst \(Germany’s Federal Intelligence Agency\) in 2015 and a new pan\-European professionalisation programme is in development with the European Union Intelligence and Situation Centre, as well as the Polish military intelligence directorate and the Austrian Ministry of the Interior. 

 Goodman’s research has directly informed the understanding of the function of intelligence throughout both the national and international community and has created concrete recommendations that have refined best\-practice across all levels of British intelligence.

<p>The research contributed to a re-evaluation of The New Humanitarian (TNH), a key media news source for policymakers and the humanitarian aid sector. These changes led humanitarian agencies to pay attention to ‘forgotten crises’, leading to action that would otherwise not have been offered. Most notable is the TNH’s reporting on the ‘overlooked’ March 2018 Yazidi healthcare crisis in Iraq. This reporting resulted in immediate action from the UN migration agency and Doctors Without Borders, among others. By the end of 2018, the main hospital serving the Yazidi minority had been moved to a safer and better-equipped facility and acquired new ambulances. TNH doubled their citation of ‘local experts’ in coverage between 2015-2017 and increased the proportion of ‘investigative’ or ‘campaigning’ journalism in their outputs. This helped humanitarian professionals develop policies that address the most urgent challenges in remote crises. For example, a 2018 TNH investigation into alleged chronic corruption in the UN’s resettlement process in Sudan caused the UN’s refugee agency to suspend resettlement operations there subject to further review. TNH’s reformed reporting has impacted the aid sector at an institutional level. For example, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and others have used TNH as a source when lobbying the UN Human Rights Council for an inquiry into abuse against the Rohingya.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Drever’s influential concept of ‘auraldiversity’ arises from his work as a creative practitioner and theorist in soundscape composition, and the insight that notional standards of hearing in that area did not reflect the true diversity of people’s aural capacities. Further investigation showed that the same held in wider society: International Standards and practices around sound and noise – especially as they have pertained to technology, and the design of place – envisaged and serviced an ideal hearing subject whose profile is based on long out\-of\-date assumptions. This can drastically diminish quality of life for those whose hearing renders them sensitive or vulnerable. Drever has worked to transform this situation through creative practice, public engagement activities, consultancy and policy work, and pedagogy. He has impacted the ways that members of the public, architects, designers, charities, future acoustics professionals and those writing International Standards understand and organise our diverse relationships with the acoustic environment. Drever’s auraldiversity research thus shows how an arts practice can lead to significant social change.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 At the heart of Drever’s recent research \(2017 \[a\]; 2020 \[a\]\) is a critical address of the ‘auraltypical’ subject whose hearing – based on studies and thresholds set generations ago – does not reflect the true diversity of aural experiences. This model originated from the ‘Acoustics – Normal Equal\-Loudness\-Level Contours ISO 226:2003,’ from which A\-weighted decibels are derived. Benchmarks made according to this International Standard can be found in the majority of acoustics regulation and practice across the world: building and planning, noise at work, aircraft noise, and so on. 

 The equal\-loudness\-level contour \(developed by Fletcher and Munson in 1933; refined in 1956 and 2003\), establishes what Drever sees as an idealised hearing subject: its measurement requires a test subject between 18\-25 years old, ‘in a normal state of health who is free from all signs or symptoms of ear disease and from obstructing wax in the ear canals, and who has no history of undue exposure to noise, exposure to potentially ototoxic drugs or familial hearing loss’ \(ISO 226:2003\). Thus, the equal\-loudness\-level contour, and the benchmarking for ‘safe’ levels of noise in everyday life that result from it, envisage and serve only an idealised, normative demographic group. Drever has coined the provocative term ‘auraltypical’ to refer to this supposedly ‘normal’ hearer. 

 However, accompanying auraltypical hearing is the actual variety of \(often less than ideal\) hearing that we experience throughout a normal day and throughout our lives, from the trifling experience of a temporary threshold shift or transient ear noise, to the intolerable pain of hyperacusis. This reality is what Drever calls ‘auraldiversity’. Drever \(2017\[a\]\) offers numerous case studies to demonstrate the ways in which people’s lives are disrupted by notionally ‘safe’ sounds which are experienced as painful, anxiety\- or depression\-inducing. For those chronically affected, these acoustic norms perpetuate a ‘social model of disability’: ‘what makes a \[person\] disabled’, Drever writes \(2017\[a\]\), ‘is not their medical condition, but the attitudes and structures of society’ that reinforce their disadvantage. Drever argues that by adopting a more diverse and inclusive approach, designers and policy\-makers can improve the wellbeing of a heterogeneous and ageing population. 

 This research builds on Drever’s longstanding interest in the relationship between listening subjects and their acoustic environments. He has explored these issues through creative and theoretical work focused on two sonic arts practices: the soundwalk, and field\-recording centred composition. Drever \(2009; 2020 \[b\]\) theorises the soundwalk as a method through which participants – specialist or non, of ‘normal’ hearing or otherwise – may gain insight into place, or transform extant and intimate knowledge of it, by way of a range of situated listening strategies. Meanwhile, Drever \(2017 \[b\]\) stages the history and practice of field recording\-centred composition as a dense web of traditions and disciplinary norms that becomes more complex as it is obliged to manage an ever\-increasing and overlapping litany of contexts: place, heritage, urban design, accessibility, environmental noise, sustainability and ecological engagement from the perspective of sound and listening. Drever explores the tensions between the compositional mechanics of organising sound, and the apparent sociality of field recording material, arguing that artists are not *de facto* more socially sensitive or ethically minded by virtue of carrying out field recording. Drever’s creative work \(as collected in 2020 \[a\]\) aims to address these issues by replacing sonic arts composition’s usual, ‘auraltypical’ presumptions with a fully auraldiverse approach. The performances ‘Ayre \#2 \[Dan Dryer\]’ \(2016\), a site\-specific installation featuring 98 different voices including those of infants and people in their 80s, and ‘Ayre \# 3’ \(2019\), a live work for 6 performers, are participatory and inclusive, placing the performers’ hearing at the centre of the creative process.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of Drever’s work on auraldiversity is evident on both local and large scales: his work has changed the thinking and activities of professionals and members of the public, and has contributed to the development of new International Standards around sound and the environment. 

 **Professionals:** For arts’ acoustics, urbanism and broadcasting professionals, Drever is a leading authority on this subject. People working in those fields have made use of Drever’s thinking on auraldiversity in diverse organisational enterprises, training sessions, and broadcasting. 

 In 2018, Drever’s work inspired composer Andrew Hugill to found the research project, auraldiversity.org. The project hosts events for acoustics professionals, as well as public concerts. Its mission statement states: ‘“auraldiversity” was coined by John Levack Drever \[...\] The Aural Diversity project applies this idea to music, the sonic arts, environmental design, audiology, hearing aid design and other related areas’ \[S1\]. The project has significantly enhanced professional engagement with auraldiverse experiences, as evidenced by the GBP20,000 developmental grant awarded to the project by hearing\-aid manufacturer, GNResound. \(Project user feedback is detailed under ‘Publics’\). 

 Drever has worked with urban planners, placemakers, civic designers and architects to increase awareness of, and implement critical thinking practices concerning, the acoustic environment. Drever is a member of the Academy of Urbanism, where his activities have helped demonstrate the importance of auraldiverse approaches to place\-making professionals. Notably, he introduced and conducted acoustic assessments for the Academy’s influential Great Place Award. Stephen Gallagher, the Academy’s Director of Engagement, writes: ‘Drever has raised awareness among the Academy and its built environment experts of the often\-overlooked importance of sound in the places we inhabit. Through his own endeavours, Prof. Drever has used his expertise on the subject to enrich our analysis of good places, which we do through The Urbanism Awards, by adding acoustic ecology as a completely new dimension to our reporting’ \[S2\]. 

 Drever regularly devises and leads soundwalks for external professional gatherings and organisations \(for example the 24<sup>th</sup> International Congress of Sound and Vibration, London, and Young Urbanists, both 2017\). He also acts as advocate of the practice in professional and other public contexts, as with his keynote ‘The Role of Improvisation in Auraldiverse Soundwalking’, given at the 2018 conference *Space, Sound and the Improvisatory: Methods, Technologies and Theories for Improvising with Natural and Built Environments*, at the Onassis Stegi, Athens, or by way of the soundwalk resources he has developed for external bodies, like the open access *DIY Primer for Soundwalking* for the Museum of Walking \(2017\). These resources enable special interest groups to approach their work differently by offering methods to explore the sonic and social characteristics of an environment. 

 Drever also has an ongoing association with the acoustics consultancy Anderson Acoustics, with which he has participated in numerous public events and a redevelopment project in the London borough of Newham. Drever’s work has shaped the company’s work beyond those collaborations. Company Director John Newman writes: ‘\[Drever’s\] work has directly helped develop and guide Anderson Acoustics’ Soundscapes and Tranquillity Practice. It is helping society understand the value of soundscapes as environmental capital and promoting it within the built environment agenda for sustainability, health and wellbeing’ \[S3\]. 

 Drever is frequently recruited by media companies and producers who wish to explore issues concerning the sonic environment. He was employed by Grapevine Digital as an acoustics expert as part of the release campaign for the film, *A Quiet Place*. In press interviews, which took place across the digital news platforms, iNews, Vice and Yahoo, Drever articulated a critical approach to the idea of silence, and its supposed desirability. Drever also contributed to monocle.com’s radio show, ‘The Urbanist’ \(2015\), discussing soundscapes and urban ecology, and to two Radio 4 segments produced by David Sillito \(2018\). Sillito writes: ‘\[Drever\] and I have managed to push the issue of sound in to some of the prime slots on the Today Programme. It was radio that provoked thought, surprise and delight and above all sounded wonderful’. Speaking on\-air of Drever’s Radio 3 ‘Music Matters’ interview \(2019\), presenter Tom Service called auraldiversity ‘just about the most transformative idea you could possibly imagine’ \[S4\]. 

 **Pedagogy:** Drever’s teaching has helped shape the careers of younger colleagues who are now further developing their own approaches to auraldiverse theory and practice. 

 The Academy of Urbanism’s Stephen Gallagher writes that ‘John has been keen to inspire the next generation of experts on the subject, through “Sound Walk” events aimed at the Academy’s Young Urbanist network’ \[S2\]. Drever’s students at Goldsmiths and other universities have been similarly inspired. The charity Theatrum Mundi, which brings together architects, planners, engineers, and urbanists to improve the understanding of cities and their design, is directed by former student John Bingham\-Hall. The charity’s Sonic Urbanism programme, which explores ‘how acoustics structure social life’, reflects Bingham\-Hall’s undergraduate study with Drever in 2008\-9. Bingham\-Hall writes that Drever’s ‘creative and academic work on urban soundscapes opened up a new set of ideas for me about what music study could mean’, and gave him interests that ‘enabled me now to lead … Theatrum Mundi’ \[S5\]. Drever is committed to coupling graduate training and social impact, and in 2018 secured a CHASE/AHRC doctoral award in collaboration with Goldsmiths and the Noise Abatement Society, for a PhD project titled ‘Liveable Listenable Cities: Human\-Centred Planning and Appraisal of Applied Soundscape Design for an Auraldiverse Population.’ Drever’s sustained commitment to teaching, and his ability to inspire among his students both creative thinking and practical action, are a central component in the continuing impact and enrichment of auraldiverse approaches across society. 

 **Publics:** Owing to the broad relevance of his thinking, and his ability to communicate ideas to general audiences, Drever is frequently invited to give talks, produce events and design educational activities for diverse publics. These explore multifaceted approaches to issues of sound, diversity, and wellbeing within the acoustic environment. 

 Drever has given over a dozen public talks since 2015, including a Royal Society of Arts Talk on the future of urban sound\-planning \(2017\), and a series of nationwide lectures as part of Sound Affects \(2018\), a series organised by the Clod Ensemble that culminated with an event at the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital. Drever also addresses smaller, special\-interest groups. Unsolicited feedback from the secretary of the Quaggy Waterways Action Group exemplifies the ways in which Drever’s public lectures inspire new kinds of awareness and thinking: ‘\[I\] noticed your voice had a slight resonance in the room which you had mentioned. I realised in that moment we have our own personal “soundscape” \[...\] Your talk was very thought provoking and stimulating’ \[S6\]. The group extended an invitation to discuss further the ideas generated, and their future application to waterways conservation work. 

 In 2018\-19, the auraldiversity.org project \(described above\) hosted a series of inclusive public concerts exploring how a consideration of auraldiversity might reshape music performance and listening practices. Attendees were encouraged to move around freely, and to experiment with different modes of engagement. Anonymous questionnaire feedback conveys the impact these auraldiverse approaches had on concert attendees: one, who attended having seen the concert advertised in the Attenborough Arts Centre \(Leicester\) brochure, described it as ‘\[a\] great evening that really made me think about different ways of listening and the importance to me of sounds and soundscapes.’ Another, who lives with hearing loss, said with ‘the diversity of listening modes \[...\] I don't feel hearing impaired. I feel like I can listen better than ever’ \[S7\]. 

 **Policy:** Drever has been an important contributor to several projects that have impacted on the development of new International Standards \(‘ISOs’\) around soundscape. These Standards have been designed to ameliorate people’s diverse experience of their acoustic environment. Drever’s work around BS ISO 12913\-1:2014 contributed to the term ‘soundscape’ becoming formally recognised in acoustics and planning. The term is referenced in the award\-winning revision of Professional Practice Guidance on Planning and Noise, ProPG \(Institute of Acoustics, 2017\). This Guidance aims ‘to provide practitioners with an industry\-recommended approach \[...\] advocat\[ing\] full consideration of the acoustic environment through state\-of\-the\-art design principles’ \[S8\]. 

 Drever has developed a sustained collaborative relationship with the Noise Abatement Society \(NAS\), whose Managing Director, Lisa Lavia, has been a central figure in the development of new ISOs around soundscape since 2010. Lavia writes that Drever’s work ‘has provided the NAS with valuable insights and support to make these concepts more widely known and better understood to new audiences, namely policy makers, the public and practitioners. This has been extremely important in helping the NAS to extend its impact and achieve support for its work helping to develop the International Soundscape Standard series \(ISO 12913\-1:2014; ISO/TS 12913\-2:2018; ISO/TS 12913\-3:2019\), and numerous action research projects’ \[S9\]. 

 Max Dixon is one of the world’s leading town planning, urban regeneration and environmental analysis experts. Assessing Drever’s contribution to recent professional discourse around the acoustic environment, he writes: ‘Drever’s many contributions to cross\-disciplinary workshops, conferences and other events have had significant practical influences on the evolution of public policy and services, both across the UK and internationally ... \[H\]is theory and practice in the fields of open space soundscapes and soundwalking have undoubtedly influenced developments in the analysis, design and management of public environments … Drever’s growing body of innovative work is an outstanding exemplar of how arts and cultural activity can both maintain its own integrity and independence while engaging productively with real world problems and stimulating evolution of new practical approaches in public policy and service delivery’ \[S10\].

Music research also supported the curation and staging of several important music festivals from a variety of genres across the UK. Finally research made important contributions to music education and the use of music for therapeutic purposes.","<h6>Student Pulse: taking classical music to a younger audience</h6>

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 ‘Avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland’ was one of the top three priorities in the UK\-EU negotiations \(2017\-2020\) and central to their most complex deliberations, but it was highly contentious and little understood. UK and EU policymakers, diplomats and negotiators used Katy Hayward’s research to shape their understanding of, and approach to, the problem. Hayward’s work also benefited a wide range of stakeholders, including those in private, public and local community sectors most directly affected, and helped equip them to meet the challenge. Overall, Hayward has made an essential contribution to managing the impact of UK withdrawal from the EU on this fragile region. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Hayward’s research on the impact of European integration on the island of Ireland has long\-evidenced the connection between cross\-border cooperation and peace\-building. This came into its own following the 23 June 2016 referendum on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, which would see Northern Ireland bordered by the EU’s external border \(between Ireland/UK\) and a new customs/regulatory border \(between Northern Ireland \[NI\] and Great Britain\). There are four elements to Hayward’s work that underpins the impact her research has had since the referendum. 

 First, Hayward was a partner in the  [*Borders In Globalization*](https://biglobalization.org/) project funded by Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, with 54 partner organizations across 11 countries \[2013\-2020; PI Emmanuel Brunet\-Jailly, University of Victoria, British Columbia\]. The project sought to inform border policy around the world through a global network of expertise on country case studies. Hayward was Lead on the Ireland/Northern Ireland case study. Informed in part by her work on European Cross\-Border Cooperation Policy, \[1\] Hayward organised knowledge\-transfer workshops for some 60 cross\-sectoral public, private and community stakeholders in 2016. This formed the basis for a policy and practitioner network that Hayward would continue to draw upon. It also informed single\- and jointly\-authored articles by Hayward and Komarova on Brexit and the Irish border. \[2, 3\] 

 In early 2017, the Irish Central Border Area Network of local authorities commissioned Hayward to carry out three ‘rounds’ of research and reports on the impact of Brexit in the border region. \[4, 5, 6\] In total, the research consisted of 3 online surveys \(which generated c.1400 responses from across the central border region\) and 15 focus groups of over 100 participants altogether. The findings of these reports were unique in being substantial, ‘up to date’, cross\-border, and cross\-community qualitative studies on the potential effects of Brexit in the border region of Ireland/Northern Ireland. They showed the connection between the open border and the peace process and the negative impact that even the mere anticipation of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU was having on cross\-border cooperation and movement. 

 Working with economist Eoin Magennis \[InterTrade Ireland, and later Ulster University\], Hayward conducted research in 2012\-13 on the all\-island business community using interview and ‘witness seminar’ data, as well as statistical data on trade flows. \[7\] This research showed the importance of the 1998 Good Friday \(Belfast\) Agreement for creating the conditions in which businesses on both sides of the border began to make the most of EU single market membership in developing the all\-island economy. Overall, it showed how sensitive cross\-border business and trade is to political and societal conditions. 

 Finally, after the negotiation of the UK\-EU Withdrawal Agreement that contained the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, Hayward’s interdisciplinary expertise was applied to analysing the potential change for Northern Ireland and its borders \(including the Irish Sea border\). Her work on the implications of the Protocol and the future UK\-EU deal built upon her expertise in border studies and in the 1998 Agreement. This included research commissioned by the Department for the Economy \(Northern Ireland\) and reported in May 2020. Hayward was the Principal Investigator and lead author \(co\-investigators and co\-authors were David Phinnemore and Milena Komarova, both QUB\) on this research. The research comprised case studies of comparator non\-EU regions plus two rounds of workshops with 100 stakeholders from across public, private and community sectors in Northern Ireland and resulted in 80 policy recommendations. \[8\]

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 When setting their objectives for the first phase of the withdrawal negotiations, the UK and EU agreed that one of their top three priorities was to ‘avoid a hard border’ on the island of Ireland. \[1\] Katy Hayward brought research expertise and evidence to what became the most high\- profile and sensitive topic in the reformulation of the UK\-EU relationship in the period 2016\-20. The subject is intrinsically international, as well as of major national significance and local consequence. It is therefore appropriate that the impact of Hayward’s work has been transnational, cross\-sectoral and multi\-level. It has taken four main forms: informing, shaping, benefiting, illuminating. Overall, Hayward has equipped policymakers and stakeholders to better understand and manage the consequences of Brexit for Northern Ireland \(NI\). 

 *1\) Informing all sides of the international negotiations* 

 A lead official in the Northern Ireland Office \(NIO\) and later the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) describes Hayward as “highly regarded” as an “authoritative voice” by UK government officials. \[2\] She has given invited talks to UK officials at critical moments in the UK\-EU negotiations \(including a masterclass at the Foreign Commonwealth Office, 15 Jan 2019, and to over 120 BEIS officials, 2 July 2019\). \[2\] Since mid\-2019 she has held frequent confidential meetings to advise and liaise with senior officials in UK Government and Northern Ireland departments tasked with managing Brexit for NI. \[2\] 

 Hayward’s research informed the briefings and recommendations regarding the Irish border provided internally to the UK government throughout the Brexit negotiations. The Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy in Dublin testifies her reports on the central border region “provided very useful, fact\-based evidence to support the analysis and advice of officials”. \[2\] 

 Hayward was one of only three academics appointed to the UK Government’s 15\-member Technical Expert panel on the Advisory Group on Alternative Arrangements in June 2019. In his letter of invitation to Hayward to join the Group, Secretary of State for Exiting the EU and Chief Negotiator for the UK, Stephen Barclay, stated that the Government would engage with the group to develop “the UK’s understanding of alternative arrangements to inform negotiations with the EU” and confirmed that members had been “chosen on the basis of their expertise and experience”. \[3\] Secretary of State Barclay attended all meetings of the Advisory Group and was the lead UK minister for the renegotiation of the backstop with the EU in 2019. 

 Hayward’s work was also drawn upon by EU negotiators and EU26 leaders. In his public lecture at Queen’s University on 27 January 2020, which was livestreamed and received international media attention, the EU’s Chief Negotiator for the UK/EU withdrawal and future relationship negotiations, Michel Barnier, remarked: “On Brexit, researchers such as Dr Katy Hayward and Professor David Phinnemore have made an important contribution to the debate, in Northern Ireland, in Westminster, and beyond. Thanks to you, Northern Ireland’s unique political, social and economic reality is understood more broadly.” \[4\] 

 The Permanent Representative of Ireland to the EU during the Brexit negotiations confirms that Barnier’s EU negotiating team “spoke to me on a number of occasions about the value and importance they attached to \[Hayward’s\] work”. \[5\] He states that he “found Katy Hayward’s informed, sophisticated, sensitive, and logically and factually rigorous research work on the Brexit process to be of great value to me and my team in Brussels, to my colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin, and to the European Commission” and that it “filled a crucial gap”. \[5\] 

 Hayward was one of 15 individuals, and the only academic, invited by An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to a private audience with Chancellor Angela Merkel on her visit to Ireland in April 2019, to brief her on the Irish border and the effects of Brexit on local border communities. The discussion and contents of that meeting are confidential but in the press conference afterwards, Merkel stated that “the EU will do everything it can to avoid a hard border”. \[6\] 

 Hayward’s research also informed the interventions made on the topic of Brexit and the Irish border by influential actors in the United States. The Ad Hoc Committee for the Protection of the Good Friday Agreement is a bipartisan group of over 50 leaders, advisors, experts and diplomats \(including two former US Senators, five former US Ambassadors, and leaders of prominent Irish American organisations\). It holds frequent meetings with the highest levels of government. It is co\-chaired by Democrat and Republican former congressmen who testify: 

 “Hayward’s research has proven to be a trustworthy, rigorous and an independent source of information that we have used as we have developed our policies and engaged with senior \[US\] government officials… 

 \[Her\] presentations and briefings became a unique opportunity to keep all Ad Hoc members keep up to date as the Brexit negotiations unfolded as we engaged leading political actors in the USA, the UK and Ireland.” \[7\] 

 *2\) Shaping legislation for post\-Brexit Northern Ireland* 

 Between October 2016 and December 2020, Hayward presented oral evidence to parliamentary committees on over twenty occasions, and has presented written evidence to committee inquiries in both chambers in of the UK Parliament, the NI Assembly, the Scottish Parliament, the Oireachtas, the British\-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, and the European Parliament Committee on Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs. Her evidence has been cited in nine reports made by Westminster committees, including in their recommendations. \[8\]  For example, she gave oral and written evidence to the House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee inquiry on the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. \[8\] Hayward was cited ten times in the subsequent report \(published 16 March 2018\). Her explanation of the increased cost and complexity of doing business across the post\-Brexit UK/EU border due to tariff and regulatory divergence was reflected in the report’s conclusions and recommendations. In its response \(15 June 2018\), the UK government stated it wanted ‘as frictionless trade as possible in goods’ with the EU and sought to avoid a hard border. \[8\] 

 Hayward was also the only academic cited in the House of Lords European Select Committee inquiry report on Brexit negotiations and the Protocol \(published 25 March 2019\). \[8\] The report’s conclusion repeated her suggestion about the governance of the Joint Consultative Working Group for the Protocol. \[8\] Hayward has also been cited in oral contributions to Parliamentary debates in Dáil Éireann, the House of Lords and the House of Commons. \[8\]  Hayward’s briefings informed amendments tabled to the UK Withdrawal Act, the Withdrawal Agreement Act, the Trade Bill and the UK Internal Market Bill in the UK Parliament. \[9, 10\] A former Secretary of State to Northern Ireland credits Hayward’s expertise “including her timely research in the central border region” as providing “a fount of evidence to inform my contribution to the debates.” \[9\] For example, “Her collaborative work with business leaders in Northern Ireland drove the tabling of key amendments in the Lords to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.” \[9\] These particular amendments on ‘unfettered access’ between NI and GB appeared in the names of Lord Peter Hain \(Labour\), Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick \(cross\-bench, former \[nationalist\] SDLP\), the noble and right reverend Lord \[former Archbishop\] Robin Eames, and Lord Reg Empey \(Ulster Unionist Party\), with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Féin and the Alliance Party – a rare example of cross\-party collaboration from Northern Ireland. \[10\] An amendment tabled by Lord Hain on the Trade Bill that was informed by Hayward’s expertise passed the House of Lords on 6 January 2021. \[9\] 

 *3\) Benefiting a wide range of stakeholders* 

 Providing detailed information, explanation and analysis of Brexit, Hayward’s work has enabled stakeholders to know what to expect after the end of the transition period and to be better prepared for it. The NI Business Brexit Working Group is a group of 14 business bodies and representative groups, covering thousands of businesses in Northern Ireland across all sectors. It testifies that the papers she has collaborated with them on: 

 “have had a major influence and direct impact on shaping the response and asks of Northern Ireland Business, the operation of the internal market and the engagement with UK Government and the EU. She has given the business sector confidence to speak out with the knowledge that our papers are based on the solid foundation of academic research. Her academic analysis has proven useful in helping us as a group compile complex arguments and information, as well as explain it to a public audience.” \[11\] 

 Her reports for the Irish Central Border Area Network, its CEO testifies, “have been reviewed by those involved in Brexit negotiations at the highest levels of the EU and in the governments of Ireland, UK and N. Ireland.” It notes its appreciation “that it has been the very good standing of Prof. Hayward and her command of the subject that has enabled the voices of citizens and workers in our region to be heard at these levels.” \[12\] This research “also provided an invaluable evidence base to inform the development of our new strategy for the Central Border Region”, proving an impact that goes beyond the immediate event of Brexit. \[12\] 

 *4\) Illuminating the subject for the wider public, through global and social media* 

 In the period October 2016 \- December 2020, Hayward was featured in over 1300 news and current affairs articles, items and programmes across 36 different countries. \[13\] She was awarded Political Communicator of the Year \(2019\) by the UK Political Studies Association and a special Ewart\-Biggs Memorial Prize \(2020\) for her media/social media contributions on Brexit. \[13\] David Allen Green \( *Financial Times*\) described Hayward’s Twitter account as “A perfect example of sheer expertise laid out practically and informatively for lay people”. \[13\] Hayward uses social media to communicate insights and explanations based on her research expertise. Her Brexit analysis has been publicly endorsed by diplomats on both sides. \[14\] Her 25,000 Twitter followers include politicians and diplomats key to the Brexit negotiations, including Donald Tusk, then\-President of the European Council, and Lord David Frost, chief UK negotiator on the UK\-EU future relationship and Joint Committee co\-chair. \[14\] Her Twitter threads on Brexit have often reached hundreds of thousands of people; and her tweets in the critical last 3 months of the transition period were seen a total of over 3.8 million times. \[14\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Black, Asian and minority ethnic people form 48.1% of Lewisham’s population, one of London’s most deprived boroughs. Transformative education research at the university led to co\-creation of knowledge\-sharing processes, which nurtured improved community\-police engagement through dialogic conflict resolution with marginalised BAME young people. In partnership with local charity Second Wave Youth Arts, UoG research enabled societal, practitioner and policy impact, by emerging leadership capabilities of marginalised young people and improving police and youth\-worker professional practices. Gradually increasing mutual respect and understanding resulted in meta\-perceptual and behavioural changes in community\-police relationships. Trust between young people and police grew, contributing to neighbourhood safety, leadership development, and to the de\-escalating of criminalisation of young people formerly triggered in police\-community encounters \(approximately 20,000 beneficiaries per year in Lewisham, London\-wide and UK\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The power of education research to transform societies is crucial in areas of deprivation such as Deptford, Lewisham, in the UK’s top 2\-4% for Crime and Environment Deprivation \(2015, IoD\). Declining global trust in leadership and information sources \(\-5%\) exacerbates public London\-wide \(\-22%\) and UK\-wide \(\-26%\) distrust in police fairness amongst Black communities. Analysis of inequalities and hyper\-criminalisation of young BAME people reveal massive disproportionality in Stop and Search, with arrests of Black youths over 4 times more likely than White youths. 

 In 2004\-05, University of Greenwich \(UoG\) researcher **Jill Jameson** interviewed 10 post\-compulsory education leaders, including a young leader \(YL\) at charity Second Wave Youth Arts \(SW\). She identified trust **\[R7** p.159 **\]** and visible/invisible paradoxical behavioural elements as essential to effective leadership \(interactively shared in a ‘dynamic, enigmatic series of processes …in socially situated communities’ enabling multiple pathways to ‘ownership of a collaborative mission’\) **\[R7,** pp.8\-10; 179\-193 **\]**. Simultaneously, **Jameson** led **G1**, the JISC eLISA; an e\-learning project migrating study skills content to e\-learning, repurposing resources for trialing with 14\-19\+ learners, in a collaborative team learning process, confirming findings that students are at their best when encouraged to be designers of their own learning **\[R1\]. Jameson** was awarded **G2** for UoG to join the JISC infoNet CAMEL project, co\-creating an intentional community of practice \(CoP\) model in a collaborative research process with four F/HE institutions. She proposed trust and tacit knowledge as key components of CAMEL **\[R7\]**. Findings from **G1** and **G2** led to **Jameson’s** **G3** award: the eLIDA CAMEL project, recreating the CoP model of a long\-term community of partners from different areas of expertise exchanging a shared passion for a domain of professional and social practice in a trustworthy space. This included mutually agreed boundaries and principles for knowledge exchange in formal and informal group activities that were truthful, nurturing, and respectfully egalitarian. These attempted to improve a learning practice domain via dialogic critique, produce new learning through knowledge management \(KM\), and design artefacts with guidance from a critical friend **\[R1, R2, R3\]**. 

 **Jameson** uniquely tailored findings from **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R5** and **R7** into innovative longitudinal educational research with SW **\[G4\],** flexibly adapting the CoP model to incorporate a creative, youth\-centred multi\-layered process\-based collaborative trust\-building approach **\[R4\]**. It included a vital element of equalising power relations \(self\-regulated leadership visibility/invisibility, a designed stepping back from visible power **\[R6**, **R7**, **S1b**, **S6b\]** to listen, learn, and give space to others\) to build trust with young people, police, and other authorities **\[R6\]**. This would enable critical conflict resolution, empowering young people’s tacit self\-knowledge and confidence as emerging leaders, transforming formerly distrustful community\-police relations. **Jameson’s** lead role in ESRC\-funded HIVE\-PED research seminar series **\[G5\]** linked to FE/HE progression research **\[R8\]** included SW as a partner, widening research dialogue on student empowerment/ progression to university experts in UK, Australia, USA, and South Africa. **Jameson** invited Ng’ambi \(University of Cape Town\) as SW international research partner, interactively engaging in dialogue on blind trust and critical thinking about technology for SW’s social media grooming event **\[S1b\],** underpinned by **Jameson’s** research on critical approaches to educational technology **\[R9**, **S4 a\-f\]**. 2020 research on this and *Shadow Games* was disrupted by COVID\-19. 

 **G1** and **G3** were carried out in partnership with academics from the Universities of Oxford and Kent, where **Jameson** \(PI\) designed a distributed collaborative evaluation methodology, applying social constructivist mixed methods, with academic learning technologists **Ryan**, **Walker** and **Dastbaz** \(UoG\) providing pedagogic and Content Management System support. In **G2** **Jameson** led the UoG arm of the study, with **Walker** and **Ryan** supplying learning technology team support; other project partners included CIs from Leeds and Loughborough FECs, Staffordshire University, JISC InfoNET and ALT. For **G5 Jameson** \(PI\) tasked CIs Kersh, Bathmaker and Orr to lead seminars, and **Ainley** to present research findings. British Educational Research Association Special Interest Group Co\-convenor \(Loo\) invited **Jameson** to co\-edit 50% of **R8** which included selected **G5** outputs. **Jameson** was PI and sole author for **G4**, **R4**, **R7**, and sole investigator for research co\-produced with members of SW’s leadership team.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In 1982, Second Wave Centre for Youth Arts \(SW\) was registered in Deptford as a charitable performing arts youth organisation to develop young people \(YP\) aged 13\-24 under\-represented in arts and cultural industries. Funders including Lewisham Council and the Home Office support SW’s creative programmes promoting civic engagement, social activism, and leadership in a safe space for YP to broaden knowledge, experience, and skills in creative, participative practice. SW’s website states, *“In partnership with the University of Greenwich, our 'community of practice' \(CoP\) approach enables the voices of YP to be heard more widely and their views taken seriously as activists for change.”* **\[S2d\].** In the view of SW, the work of **Prof Jill Jameson** *""has been a constant source of influence and ideas in the development of our youth\-centred creative learning programme” and made an “extensive and sustained contribution to our evolving programme of youth arts activities, over 20 years of partnership work, including our Critical Encounters, Shadow Games and Hate Crime initiatives.”* 

 SW’s Community Development Worker \(anonymised as ‘PT’\) **\[S1b\]** recalls the origins of its CoP approach *: “Prof Jill Jameson became a regular visitor to Second Wave.... In 2004\-2005, she contributed to Second Wave’s distinctive style and methods of creative learning \[in\] a sustained dialogue with our trustees, staff and young leaders. Prof Jameson underlined the value of our partnership work and introduced the concept of participatory research \[in\] a community of practice \(CoP\). The distinctive value of the CoP \[is\] a shared understanding of intractable problems.”* This co\-created model enabled long\-term social learning and dialogic KM development in truthful, collaborative, equal discursive inquiry in a safe space **\[R1\].** Dialogic processes, trust\-building methods, and youth\-centred leadership **\[R4, R7\]** included CoP methods to surface new depths of tacit knowledge **\[R1, R2\],** growing expertise, better community\-police relations, and enhanced recognition of SW as an organisation achieving best practice in work with young people **\[S1a\-b, S2a\-c, S3a\-f, S7, S9\]**. 

 From 2004, SW introduced critical community safety issues into its creative arts programmes, focusing on YP\-police interactions. To challenge disproportionate ‘Stop and Search’ experiences severely affecting local neighbourhoods, regular **Critical Encounters** workshops began, to continue for 17\+ years, with impact accumulating in annual student\-police cohorts 2013\-2020, leading to life\-changing transformational empowerment of multiple YP. Workshops were informed by **Jameson’s** research, trust\-building CoP concepts and methods woven throughout discussions and presentations \(2004\-2020\) **\[S1a\-b\]**. Workshops led by young people \(approximately 20 per year\) included successive cohorts of local police officers participating in plain/casual clothes on equal terms with YLs, both sides bringing experiences and insights into drama\-based role\-reversal in safe workshop spaces. Knowledge\-sharing interactive visible/invisible distributed leadership \(VIDL\) processes in **Critical Encounters** focused on tensions and responsibilities of managing difficult YP\-police interactions at street level, and nurturing dialogic methods to avoid escalating conflict. PT **\[S1b\]** noted, *“building solidarity, ownership of learning, and community cohesion”* through CoP processes *“validated YP’s needs, interests, and safety concerns”.* SW’s Director said, *“the importance of trust ... how to build leadership and trust as an organisation \- that thematic focus at the heart of our work ... wouldn't be so specific as it is without Jill's involvement… that synergy, you know, of her saying, 'No, this is actually really important' is what has helped to influence and raise our awareness of how important that work is.”  \[S1a\]** 

 In 2015, **Shadow Games** began: a youth\-led programme on radicalisation **\[S4a\-f\],** now a nationally recognised Home Office\-funded Prevent Good Practice model **\[S4f\],** narrating the online grooming of Samuel, a young person coerced into violent extremism by older man Osiris. Reaching 6,826 pupils, **Shadow Games** voices YP’s concerns on grooming themes, explored via theatre, stimulating critical awareness in audience dialogue. Lewisham’s Select Committee noted \(2019\): *“The success and innovative nature of this project has led to national recognition for Second Wave, and its inclusion in the national catalogue of best\-practice Prevent projects.”* **\[S4f\]** 

 Throughout 2004\-20, such SW programmes explored and analysed key issues of trust and leadership. PT said, *“Young leaders became …exponents of innovative \[CoP\] practices”*, and police, relieved to be in a safe, informal trustworthy dialogic space **\[S6a\-d\]**, *“introduced* *their own professional expertise”* **\[S1b\].** An officer recalled: *“police \[are\] used to being in charge… guardians of everyone...the power of \[this\] is that we enter this space: we are not the custodians, leaders or in charge, but are given permission to come into this space where it belongs to someone else.... we are welcomed, so, a weight comes off… **Critical Encounters** is so important because it's trust\-building work.”* A Territorial Support Group officer said the CoP partnership work *“created a really good model of practice to be shared more widely,* \[which is\] *extremely valuable.”* **\[S6,S5a\-b,S7,S9\]** 

 **<ins>Impacts on policy and practice**</ins> included significant improvements and greater confidence in knowledge\-generation, trust\-building and leadership processes across all operations for SW, resulting in recognition such as *2015 British Empire Medal to Phil Turner, Second Wave, for services to Young People, Police and Community Engagement; Home Office 2014\-19 Best Practice Awards for Work with Young People; 2014 Mayor of London Peace Award; 2017 Trophy of Appreciation, Lewisham Safer Neighbourhoods Board;* and SW YP invited roles to advise police in *Lewisham’s Independent Advisory Group/Youth IAG, and Metropolitan Police Service \(MPS\) Directorate IAG*  **\[S1a\-b, S2a\].** As an expert on building trust and leadership in CoPs in education research, **Jameson** helped frame public discourses on YP’s relationship with police in SW’s invited contribution to the *‘Report of the Inquiry held by the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Children 2013\-2014, “It’s all about trust”: Building good relationships between children and the police’,* **\[S7\]** in which SW’s model of building trust and equalising power, influenced by **Jameson’s** research, was linked to improved community\-police relations and changes in police training, evidenced in testimony for SW’s successful *Queen’s Anniversary Award \(2021\)* **\[S9\].** PT notes *, “both SW and UoG were key partners working together to achieve these”* and other impacts **\[S1b\]. Jameson**/SW’s COVID\-19\-postponed research will resume to develop the dialogic trust\-building UoG\-SW model with Cambridge University Educational Dialogue Research Group \(CEDiR\), Lucy Cavendish College, and Ng’ambi for South African take\-up in areas with similar challenges. 

 **<ins>Improved community\-police engagement/social policy</ins>:** The research on trust and leadership in YP’s engagement with police improved community\-police relations, police training and social policy \(as oral evidence from PT, 3 SW YP, and involved police officers recorded\), directly influencing Recommendation 8 in the 2014 *Report of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Children, “It’s all about trust”: Building good relationships between children and the police,* recommending *“The College of Policing should promote the direct involvement of ...young people in the training of police … and involve ...young people with experiences of stop and search in its review of stop and search training... commissioned by the Home Secretary.”* \(pp.12\-13; 27\-28\) **\[S7\].** The 2015\-16 National Police Chief’s Council’s Strategy aligned itself to the report’s priorities **\[S8\]**, the research contributing widely to shifting policy and thinking in the way the MPS approaches community engagement, in both training and qualifications **\[S5a\-b; S6d\].** PT **\[S1b\]** noted that *“participation in this model of research has been transformative*… whereas previously, *“a stark deficit of trust”* meant positive relationships with YP was a low police priority vs *. “a focus on enforcement action viewing young people as enemies of public order”*, the CoP led to a *“gradual shift from narrow views of law enforcement to wider contextual understandings of the duty to protect young people from harm, impact of vulnerability and safeguarding*, *changing perceptions in policing”.* London SE Command Unit aims \(2020\-23\) now include: *“to increase participation with Youth, BAME and Faith communities across the 3 boroughs”* \(Lewisham, Greenwich, Bexley\) **\[S1b, S5a\-b\].** *“This ‘engagement approach’ recommends ‘strong relationships with community partners and leaders’ to ‘play an active role in promoting shared values and building trust.’ The strategy insists on policing with care, compassion, and respect, ‘learning from communities to improve trust and public confidence,’”* all findings from UoG research, PT observes **\[S1b\].** 

 Sustainability of progress is a crucial finding, given reversal of significant earlier achievements improving Stop and Search \(complaints decreased from 24/25 per year in 2008 to 0 in 2017, and confidence in police increased from 33% to 67%\) in Lewisham: but progress stalled \(2018\) when a senior inspector retired. ‘Peter’ said, *“the year I left, I think we'd had, for the previous 3 years… absolutely no complaints”.* **\[S6a\]** The research therefore includes, as PT says, *“a steady process of mobilising resistance to shortcomings in police practice, a critical perspective maintained with elevated persistence, often with a sense of swimming against the tide. The support of \[UoG\] documenting different phases of this journey is extremely helpful, providing a consistent overview, understanding of continuity, as changes of thinking \[were\] introduced, explored, and gradually included \[in\] the CoP.”* **\[S1a\-b, S2a\-c, S3a\-f, S9\].** 

 **<ins>Impacts on the community**</ins>: Beneficiaries of SW’s work in 2015\-20 \(approximate total per year 20,000\) included 42 young volunteers, 24 YP in employment/ work experience organised at SW, 72 youth arts workshops attendees, 9 performances for youth audiences of 360\+; 15 learning support sessions for 60\+ participants, 25 Lewisham Hate Crime Forum participants, including 10 police officers and Territorial Support Group officers, 15 outreach sessions with 300\+ local people in community settings; 16 training sessions for 30 young volunteers; 9 drama performances for intergenerational audiences of 450\+; 3 social action projects for 30 young volunteers; 15 training sessions for 18\+ young workshop leaders, 3 intergenerational outreach events for 100\+ local new users.  **\[S1a\-b, S4a\-e, S10\].** PT wrote **\[S1b\]**: *“Working with academics, professionals, decision\-makers… sharing experiences, debating ideas, addressing issues of direct importance, was transformative for young people’s view of themselves and their abilities to influence a world often appearing hostile to their interests and needs”* **\[S1b, S3a\-f\]**. Impacts from Aug 13 \- Dec 20 were: 

-  **Transformation from fear/anger to confident assertion of legal rights:** *“I learned YP also have the power to change the narrative: it all changes when you know your rights.”*  **\[S4a\]** 

-  **Quality of life enhancements: skills, job success, trust in/compassion for police** *: “It definitely was the instrumental part of my having the confidence to be who I am”* **\[S3e\]; “** *SW is like an intensive course for life”,* We learned *“really invaluable skills that we now both use in our careers” “It opened up discussion for compassion”*; “ *They built this trust.”* **\[S3c\]** 

-  **Building community trust, leadership and awareness of YP policing:** *“It's building trust within the whole community, so communities don't feel like they're on their own.” “We feel proud to have questions answered in the highest level about the impact of Stop and Search on YP, to make sure that's always in the conversation.”* **\[S2a, S1a, S3a\-f, S4a\]** 

 **<ins>Impacts on young people**</ins>: PT noted, *“Our YLs found difficulty acknowledging their own… expertise”,* so **Jameson** “ *drew* *attention to \[research* *on\] the value of a sustained CoP, …mutually respected values, underpinning trust, ...and shared leadership”* **\[R1b, R6\].** One YL said *, “This is where I first came across Prof. Jill and the partnership with UoG. In our first meeting we \[discussed\] young people, trust, and leadership. The **Young Leaders** programme was a product of that conversation. I took the lead on the programme…. to transform spaces outside of SW where young people as critical thinkers were active vocal members of their community.”* **\[S3a\].** The Actor playing Osiris said, “ *Jill has been to **Shadow Games** … at the end, there's a discussion… she has given some very, very good, knowledgeable answers for a lot of YP… those discussions are very, very important. Those safe spaces for young people, young adults, the knowledge of people from UoG like Jill, to come and give some gems, as we’d say in our community, drop some gems on young people, yeah\!”* **\[S4a\]** PT noted **Jameson’s** advice surfaced unrecognised *“tacit knowing”* in creative workshops, **\[S1b\],** building YP’s confidence to participate equally, design their own learning **\[S1a, b, S3a\-f, R1, R3\]** and, in 2013\-2020, take on IAG roles, representing YP’s views on policing at the House of Lords, House of Commons and New Scotland Yard **\[S1a\-b, S2a, S10\].**

Second Wave has a proactive range of collaborative relationships with numerous supporting partners, including Lewisham Borough Council (LBC), the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), Lewisham Community Police Consultative Group (LCPCG) and the Territorial Support Group (TSG). Youth-centred artistic and creative processes are at the heart of everything that Second Wave does as an organisation. Underpinning this mission is a model of youth arts practice that has been highly successful. This model is not always easy to recognise or understand, as it has aspects that are based on an almost invisible structure designed to facilitate effective practice in youth arts work. Young people who join Second Wave are brought into a community of practice (CoP) (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1999) involving a dynamic, fluid process which is distinctive in its transformative power to change people’s lives. The philosophy behind this involves Dewey’s notion of the ‘active self’ (Dewey, 1916) and the theories of ‘social constructivism’ (Vygotsky, 1978). The process fosters trust, confidence and social learning (Bandura, 1977; Vygotsky, 1978) in which young people join in with a dialogue involving participation in the youth-centred creative space. The ‘border zone’ (Heath, 1994) in that creative space enables young people to connect with each other in the specialist field of youth arts. The youth-centered partnerships involved lead to greater confidence and development in a range of important artistic, social, cognitive and emotional skills and opportunities. Ultimately, the young person may become engaged in multi-agency working with Second Wave’s external partners. Throughout all of these processes, young people are encouraged progressively to develop a more ‘active self’ to engage proactively with many different beneficial opportunities relating to the performing arts. This report aims to describe key aspects of Second Wave’s approach and to identify and disseminate its model of good practice in order to make this more explicit and accessible to others. It is with awareness of the profoundly challenging circumstances facing young people, particularly but not exclusively in inner city urban areas such as Deptford, and the valuable contribution youth arts work can make to their well-being and development, that the research report has been produced. Without the support of such beneficial practices in youth arts, young people may find themselves adrift, drowning in a sea of uncertainty and difficulty with many life problems. The Second Wave Youth Arts Model of Creative Practice is provided to assist others to support young people to find ‘islands of truth’ and safety in the development of their identity and their future, both in creative arts and in their adult lives ahead.', 'original': None}"", 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Jill', 'last_name': 'Jameson', 'initials': None, 'researcher_id': 'ur.012725732627.13',

<p>This research into how criminal justice practitioners and service providers in the UK can support victims-survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) leveraged over £7.2 million in funding to expand a GBV-prevention programme in the UK. This program is shown to reduce abuse by high-risk perpetrators by up to 88% and underpinned new UK family court guidance to protect children from domestic abuse.

<h6>Advances in the Neuroscience of Trauma & Crime: Transforming justice globally for vulnerable people in custody</h6>
<p>Research uncovered that 42,000 people currently in UK prisons have some form of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), which is associated with impulsivity and problems in social reasoning. This finding changed judicial and health policies in the UK and (those endorsed by the UN) UN to take account of TBI and Neurodisability. It also led to changes in practice across the prison system impacting 83,000 existing prisoners and 60,00 new entrants each year, including mandatory neurodisability screening and enhanced support and staff training.

<h6>Designing out Crime: Improving police and planning policy and practice to reduce crime and create safer communities</h6>
<p>Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) creates housing developments that are less vulnerable to crime, with housing built to Secured by Design (SBD) standards that experience 55% less burglary. This changed government planning guidance and building regulations in the UK and the United Arab Emirates and increased the number of secure homes (44% of new homes built between 2013 and 2017 were SBD), which reduced crime and increased feelings of safety.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Dr Susan Liggett’s** research underpins this case study. Journal articles were co\-authored with visiting researcher, Mike Corcoran \(scientist\), Clare Harding \(PhD candidate\) and Dr Mark Lochrie, University of Central Lancashire. Book co\-authored with Emeritus Professor of Electronic Imaging, Rae Earnshaw, Bradford University; the late Professor Peter Excell, Emeritus Professor of Communications, Glyndwr University; and Professor Daniel Thalmann, Director of Research and Development at MIRALab Sarl, Singapore. 

 A new conceptual model, ‘ *Show\-talk\-do’* \[R2\], and subsequent journal paper \[R3\] were borne out of the creative exhibitions and symposia series, ‘ *Carbon Meets Silicon’* \( *CMSI & II,* 2015/17\) \[R1\] Wrexham. Curated by **Liggett,** the exhibitions brought together 36 international artists, scientists and researchers from the UK, Italy, Denmark, Australia and the USA. The exhibitions established a diverse international network, spawning new and more effective research partnerships and it introduced new public audiences to emerging research areas. This is evidenced by the exhibiting artists then contributing to the open access book co\-authored by **Liggett** with Visiting Professor Earnshaw \(Computing\) et al., ‘Technology, Design and the Arts – Opportunities and Challenges” \(2020\) \[R2\]. **Liggett’s** role was in selecting contributing artists, many of whom were part of CMSII, peer reviewing chapters and considerable editing. 

 Exhibiting researchers in CMSI & II explored commonalities between their research processes and outputs, the challenges of, and opportunities for, collaboration between diverse research areas, and engaged new and non\-expert audiences with emerging areas of academic thought and research. The MOSTYN EDGE project, Llandudno \(2019/2020\) \[R5, R6\], and the ‘Creative Resilience’ programme at Ty Pawb, Wrexham \(2019/ongoing\) were a result of this process. Key to the exhibition’s ethos was the concept of 'research as practice', with the artefacts of the research process presented in a new context to overcome interdisciplinary communication challenges and to provoke thought and discussion as described in ‘ *Interdisciplinary Research Unmasked: a new curatorial model was developed for multi\-audience engagement’* \( **Liggett** & Corcoran\) \[R3\]. 

 Building upon and informed by the interdisciplinary aims and findings of these exhibitions, the model was tested through literature reviews, case study development, observations and interviews with artists, scientists, research funders, and science communicators. Described in the journal article, 'Framing the Conversation' \( **Liggett** & Corcoran\), the model demonstrates the relationship between diverse audiences, distinct curatorial practices and research outcomes and visually represents the steps that all researchers, stakeholders, and publics can follow to create wide\-ranging engagement and produce interdisciplinary outputs \[R4\]. It was adopted by FOCUS Wales in 2017 & 2018 and contributed to novel collaborations with key arts institutions, MOSTYN and Ty Pawb across North Wales. **Liggett,** in collaboration with MOSTYN gallery, identified that issues around engagement can arise when digital content is delivered within a public gallery and that specialist knowledge, audience expectations, and funding impact on current practices. PhD student, Clare Harding was co\-funded by Glyndŵr University and MOSTYN to help investigate practical challenges and approaches taken to define what audiences want from a public art gallery. Journal articles, ‘ *Digital Engagement in a Contemporary Art Gallery: Transforming Audiences*’ \[R5\] and, ‘ *What Do Audiences Want from a Public Art Gallery in the Digital Age?’*\( **Liggett**, Harding & Lochrie\) \[R6\] outline the research underpinning the EDGE and Canvas projects at MOSTYN. For example, existing research that applies technology to art galleries does so to measure audience reactions; however, it was found that we must first understand the audience’s beliefs, preferences, and insights before using digital means to record reactions and fulfil wider organisational ambitions. Also, an initial human\-centred feasibility study looked at how audiences want to interact with a public art gallery in an age of rapidly developing technology, alongside a public consultation, and it was found that audiences wanted more engagement, more talks, and more artists featured.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **i\) Providing a new conceptual model to support curators and researchers, internationally, and inspiring new forms of artistic expression and innovation.** 

 The research has generated new ways of thinking, influencing creative practice. The ‘ *Show\-Talk\-Do Model'* presents a practical way of thinking about the role of an exhibition to overcome siloed working and communication challenges to encourage cross\-discipline working. The model has been disseminated internationally in Chapter 3, 'Technology, Design and the Arts – Opportunities and Challenges’ – it has been downloaded 2,200 since open\-access publication in June 2020 \(with the full text downloaded over 45K times from 114 countries\) \[ **source 1**\]. 

 The research artefacts exhibited, and partnerships forged through *Carbon Meets Silicon* exhibitions have led to the development of new artistic products and innovations by a number of creative professionals. It was the catalyst for one UK based artist to seek collaboration with a project supported by the EU Commissions Joint Research Centre \(Italy 2019\). She said, “This model of multi\-audience engagement developed by Liggett and Corcoran is unique and has contributed to the development of my recent collaborative work. Also acting as a foundation for a new body of work, recently commissioned by SciArt for the EU Commission” \[ **source 2**\]. 

 One international artist said: “The invitation to participate in the Carbon Meets Silicon II exhibition and symposium in 2017 was a pivotal opportunity for my collaborator and myself to showcase the work of localStyle in a combined context of intellectual inquiry and creative output in Wales. Having already exhibited our work extensively in many cities all over the world, it was nevertheless a significant event for us to make the journey to Wales and participate in these events in person” \[ **source 3**\]. They also said: “In our view it is without question that the spirit of shared enterprise and atmosphere of creative and intellectual rapport that we experienced in Wrexham subsequently led to our receiving an invitation to submit a co\-authored chapter—‘Coral Voices’—that is intended to contribute to a more dimensionalised understanding of one of our more recent projects. The book chapter is open access and thus free to anyone in the world to download which helps disseminate our artwork and the conceptual basis—grounded in absorbing a large quantity of current coral reef research—and studio working process to those unable to visit Chicago” \[ **source 3**\]. 

 **ii\) Informing novel collaborative approaches to business development within creative institutions.** 

 The research fed directly into MOSTYN’s strategy/business plan and contributed towards their organisational resilience by opening up new funding streams and partnership opportunities. The 'EDGE for Schools' Arts Council Wales \(ACW\) funded programme at MOSTYN \(2019/2020\) directly resulted from the Glyndŵr University \(GU\)/MOSTYN research and collaboration \[R5, R6, **source 8**\]. This bilingual programme involved artists working with school children to gain digital skills above and beyond those acquired in the curriculum. The workshops were attended by almost 200 pupils at four schools in Conwy county within the impact period \(2018\-2019\) \[ **source 4**\]. Further funding from Innovate UK for The MOSTYN EDGE Canvas project \(2019\-2020\) was secured by MOSTYN to fund workshops with gallery staff and audiences to explore the challenges of integrating digital technologies effectively within their curatorial programme. Director of MOSTYN said: “These projects and related research have now generated over £250,000 of funding that would not have been possible without the GU/MOSTYN collaboration” \[ **source 5**\]. This collaborative work also led directly to employment for the PhD student as the Programme Fundraising manager at MOSTYN. 

 Director of Ty Pawb, the creative hub and gallery in Wrexham became aware of journal articles co\-authored by **Liggett** and was interested in the user\-centred research methods adopted at MOSTYN to help understand gallery audiences. **Liggett** was approached to scope a strategically important research question around resilience and a collaborative research agreement was made between Ty Pawb and Glyndŵr \[ **source 9**\]. **Liggett,** with a co\-funded PhD candidate, is now contributing to the ACW funded, ‘Creative Resilience’ programme \(2019 ongoing\) at Ty Pawb. This programme is exploring new, resilient and sustainable business models to challenge the traditional models of art galleries. Ty Pawb Director said: “Overall, our collaboration with Glyndŵr University has benefited us greatly through helping to shape our business development model and also with the delivery of projects which are of crucial strategic importance especially now during the global pandemic when the gallery is closed” \[ **source 6**\]. 

 **iii\) Engaging the general public with the academic research process in a new way / developing stimuli to cultural tourism and contributing to the quality of the tourist experience.** 

 The ‘Show\-Talk\-Do’ \[R2, R3\] approach informed 'Digital Innovations at FOCUS Wales', a Welsh Government sponsored exhibition and symposia for musicians, artists and technologists forming a key part of the FOCUS Wales festival in 2017 and 2018, one of the UK's largest international showcase festivals for the music industry. Partner and Co\-Founder of FOCUS said: “Mike Corcoran’s involvement in the programme, building on his on\-going research into interdisciplinary collaboration with Glyndŵr University, allowed us to enhance the impacts we could achieve: following the ‘Show\-Talk\-Do’ approach by combining exhibitions and installations, with informal opportunities for open and exploratory discussion, and formal facilitated discussion to identify opportunities to work together – all under the public gaze” \[ **source 7**\]. 

 Comments from attendees and participants included: 

 “Around 210 artists and groups performed this year, 32 of which are international, and the event attracted 8000 visitors to the area, 12% of which were from overseas. The conferences burgeoning tech and digital platform will only accelerate those numbers in the coming years. FOCUS Wales seems set fair as a growing and very interesting conference” \(Media Review\) \[ **source 7**\]. 

 “We visited the digital day ... and it was great to see so many local innovators in one 

 place. The panels were fascinating and informative, we really enjoyed listening to a range of ideas from using AI to help you compose music to collaborative music projects using Ableton and harnessing the communal experience of the internet. What a forward thinking event to have on our doorstep” \[ **source 7**\]. 

 “I enjoyed the panel and got a lot of great new contacts, no improvements needed as far as I can tell. I met with quite a few people from music industries from Canada and Wales as well as new contacts from my home country \(the Netherlands\). It was a great learning experience to hear from people from 'across the pond' about their challenges in their industry” \[ **source 7**\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Local museums and archives house collections which are often under\-utilised or presented in a ‘two\-dimensional’ way that audiences struggle to engage and connect with. Murjas’s research has changed how several local museums and archives perceive and use their objects, enabling them to reinterpret their collections using multi\-media installations and theatrical performance techniques. The *Clamorous Objects* projects have elicited emotional responses to objects and collections from migrants, curators, interpreters, medical professionals, creative practitioners and audience members, and helped individuals explore and come to terms with past experiences. Murjas’s approach to curating ‘histories from below’ has influenced how practitioners from a range of sectors conceptualise and share archives and is now being used as a benchmark by sector leaders such as Research Libraries UK \(RLUK\). 
","
1.  **Underpinning research** 

 Murjas’s research since 2002 has explored Polish cultures, identities and histories. She edited and critically contextualised three English\-language collections of previously un\-translated Polish\-language plays, that she also directed and produced. Murjas used practice\-led research to examine under\-represented aspects of Second World War migration from Poland. The narrative focus for *Surviving Objects* was her mother’s deportation in 1940 and eventual arrival in the UK following the Polish Resettlement Act, 1947. Drawing on their audio\-recorded conversations and objects from her mother’s personal wartime archive, together they developed approaches to ethically mediating these private materials. 

 The work directly informed Murjas’s ongoing research into the intergenerational significance of personal archives; their performative creation, curation and \(re\)mediation; and their tangible and intangible qualities. Themes of conflict and migration link the five strands that make up *Clamorous Objects: Unmuting the Archive*, which emphasise collaborative, participatory, artistic\-curatorial approaches to animating histories ‘from below’. 

  

 Developing from *Surviving Objects,* Murjas established an artists’ collective working with personal archives related to migration, called *Peeling Onions with Granny* \(POWG\). Murjas worked with Nicky Werenowska, a POWG member, to develop a play based on Werenowska’s memories of migration, *Silence.* This play received Arts Council England \(ACE\) funding for a professional regional tour \(output 1\). A further play was devised addressing migration themes, this time concerning the challenges that interpreters face working within UK public services. *Between*, was created by a storytelling company led by Murjas called *Around the Well* \(ATW\) \(output 2\). ATW worked in collaboration with mental health practitioners and interpreters to develop the play and an NGO called *Mothertongue* that until 2018, provided culturally and linguistically sensitive counselling for people from black and minority ethnic communities. In the play *Between,* ATW members explore the ethical sharing of personal and professional insights into varied interpreter\-mediated encounters. 

 Murjas’s artistic research also extended to local museum and heritage sectors. *The* *First World War in Biscuits* \(FWWIB\) \(output 3\) and  [*War Child: Meditating on an Archive*](https://www.war-child-archive.com/) \(WCMA\) \(output 4\) drew in different ways on the  [Huntley & Palmers](https://www.readingmuseum.org.uk/your-visit/permanent-galleries/huntley-and-palmers-gallery) and Evacuee Archives held in the Special Collections at the University of Reading. In FWWIB, a collaboration between Murjas, the Museum of Rural English Life \(MERL\) and Reading Museum, Murjas combined new videos and audio recordings with artefacts and archival materials from the Huntley & Palmers’ collection, to emphasise the company’s wartime role. FWWIB formed the centrepiece of Reading Museum’s ‘Reading at War’ exhibition \(2018\). It was later installed at Colchester’s The Minories and also featured in The National Archives’ \(TNA\) ‘Explore Your Archives’ week \(2018\). WCMA is a web\-based ‘mixed\-media book’ that illustrates the Evacuee Archive, established by Martin Parsons, an historian of child evacuation and housed at The MERL. *War Child: Meditating on an Archive* brings the archive to life through audio\-clips of conversations with Martin Parsons, his daughters and an academic colleague, exploring the impact that the archive of papers and objects has had on their lives \(output 4\). Murjas went on to analyse the differing approaches taken in the two projects, comparing methods of spatial and digital curation to improve ‘discoverability’ \(output 5\). 

 Murjas’s collaborative research with the MERL has continued through participation in the ACE funded ‘Museum of the Intangible’ project. Responding to the MERL’s collections, Murjas worked with poet Jack Thacker and his farming family to develop a filmpoem,  [*I, Sheep*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz7AhubH0uM) \(output 6\) which incorporates nonhuman viewpoints of rural life and heritage.

1.  **Details of the impact** 

 Murjas’s multi\-media and digital approaches to under\-utilised, intangible collections of cultural heritage and personal archives have allowed local museums and archives to rethink how they present these collections to their audiences and the emotional responses that can be elicited from such collections. Her work, recognised by national institutions including TNA and RLUK as an example of best practice, has enabled a step\-change in curating practices. 

 **A. Influencing practice within the creative professions** 

 *Clamorous Objects* has provided the opportunity for collaboration across the arts and heritage sectors and between creative practitioners. Murjas, a theatre practitioner, has presented her work to librarians, archivists and curators and influenced their practice. For example, WCMA was presented at two events during the 2018 Being Human Festival and at a joint keynote lecture with Kate Arnold\-Forster, Director of the MERL, at the Universeum Conference in Glasgow \(2018\).  In 2020 Murjas was invited to speak about WCMA at an OKRE event which brought together archivists, curators and members of the entertainment industries \(E1\). 

 The cross\-sector, collaborative approach developed through *Clamorous Objects* has enabled the participating archives and museums to work for the first time with creative practitioners. ATW and POWG have also facilitated interpreters, creative practitioners and medical professionals to collaborate on devised public performances. This has further informed their own practice and led to wider reflections on how family histories and personal archives provide powerful narratives to convey messages around migration and identity. One member of POWG commented that: ‘The support given – creative, technical and emotional – through the collaborative nature of the \[POWG\] collective and its projects has been key in helping me to develop and to produce artworks which link the “micro” of the subject matter to the “macro” of related themes. It has helped me to apply a level of intellectual and academic rigour to the work and has also helped that work develop in ways I had not envisaged \[…\]’ \(E2\). 



 The film poem *I, Sheep* was the first of its kind and engaged with audiences in new ways, receiving coverage in *The Countryman* magazine \(monthly circulation 10,000\) and 2,700 views on YouTube.  Jack Thacker, the poet who collaborated with Murjas on *I, Sheep,* commented that: ‘This project turned out to mark a key moment in my development as a creative writer. The launch of *I, Sheep* has undoubtedly raised my profile and has provided access to audiences I otherwise would not have reached. More importantly, it has reinforced for me the importance of my rural upbringing for my creative practice’ \(E3\). 

1.  **New ways for audiences to engage with archival and museum collections** 

 Murjas’s research using multi\-media approaches to interpreting personal archives has engaged audiences in new ways. The archivist behind WCMA commented that through collaborating with Murjas it ‘became apparent that the information contained in the letters, artefacts and ephemera and the insight they provided into the daily life of these people during difficult times, could be better expressed in the performing and visual arts than it could by simply using the same research materials in textbooks and academic papers \[…\] It added a different dimension to \[people’s\] understanding of the archive as well. It was not simply countless bundles of abstract and non\-attributable letters; each had a story to tell and there was an actual person responsible for each one’ \(E4\). 

 Changing how these stories, objects and collections were presented to the public enabled a change in attitudes towards the role of interpreters, as demonstrated by the performances of *Between.*  Audience members commented that after watching the play they had a ‘new way of understanding interpreting’, and that they were able to ‘understand and consider the different situations and viewpoints of patients, interpreters and medical practitioners’. Audience members who were interpreters themselves also commented that the experience had made them feel less alone in a challenging sector \(E5\). A review of *Between* by the Institute of Translating and Interpreting stated that there was ‘a clear consensus that this material \[…\] deserved to be shared with a much broader audience’ as ‘audience members witnessing \[it\] found themselves sharing in the challenges and ethical quandaries of interpreting for people in delicate situations’ \(E5\). 

1.  **Changing how archives and museums perceive and use their objects:** 

 The impact of Murjas’s work in eliciting emotional responses from audiences using personal archives and overlooked collections has helped several small archives and museums change their approach to the curation and display of these items. Following on from the success of FWWIB, Reading Museum moved the Huntley & Palmers’ artefacts which were used as part of the project out of the museum’s storage facility and into its permanent exhibition space. The project also led to a ‘step\-change’ in how the museum puts on exhibitions \(E6\). Murjas’s research has also influenced the development of policy and best practice guidance for local museums and archives through the MERL’s *Museum of the Intangible*. This project provides guidance on how to preserve and curate intangible cultural heritage and produced a toolkit which features exhibits or installations produced by creative practitioners in response to the MERL’s collections \(including Murjas’s piece *I, Sheep*\). This toolkit is freely available and has received 951 views since its publication in 2019; the average dwell time for this webpage is up 111% on the MERL’s average, demonstrating clear engagement with the toolkit \(E7\). 

 The impact of Murjas’s research in the local archive and museum sector has influenced sector leaders, including TNA. As part of ‘Explore Your Archives’ week, TNA focused their Tuesday theme on \#EdibleArchives, a concept which came directly out of Murjas’s research project FWWIB. Representatives from TNA and Miranda Gore\-Brown \(Great British Bake Off finalist – series 1\) were invited to see Murjas’s research, the Reading Museum collection and the Huntley & Palmers’ archive at the University of Reading’s Special Collections. As a result of this visit, Gore\-Brown wrote an article for the *Who Do You Think You Are Magazine,* which has a print circulation of 17,500, and FWWIB was used as the headline story by TNA to launch the \#ExploreArchives week on BBC Breakfast on 17<sup>th</sup> November 2018 \(1,400,000 viewers\). Murjas’s research and work with TNA was highly valued, particularly for how it engaged new audiences with the archive sector using multi\-media and performative methods: ‘It proved a significant talking point. The history of food and material culture was such an engaging topic for the First World War, and the work undertaken at Reading to promote the Huntley & Palmer collections has been interesting and valuable’ \(E8\). 

 Murjas’s approach to working with archives and special collections has resulted in her involvement in RLUK’s Special Collections Programme \(SCP\), which created a free\-to\-use survey toolkit for assessing the content, condition and significance of special collections which currently have no finding aids to make them discoverable. The toolkit is part of SCP’s consortium\-wide initiative to develop an audience\-focused strategy for special collections which will increase their use and audience engagement with them. Murjas’s approach and the resulting mixed\-media practice\-led output WCMA was used as an exemplar of how this could be achieved through transforming special collections from ‘closed spaces to hubs of creativity and innovation’ using mixed media approaches. WCMA’s inclusion in this toolkit shows how Murjas’s work, which is centred on increasing the discoverability of special collections through digital means, is having an impact in the wider archive sector \(E9, E10\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Halit Yozgat was murdered by neo\-Nazis in Kassel, Germany in 2006. A German secret service agent was present at the time of the killing, but claimed that he was not a witness; police and courts accepted his testimony. In 2016, Forensic Architecture \(FA\), a research agency based in the Visual Cultures department at Goldsmiths, was commissioned to investigate the murder. 

 New evidence presented by FA contradicted the agent’s claim and was used by the Yozgat family’s lawyers, reviewed by two parliamentary inquiries, presented in a ‘citizens tribunal’ and via 20 exhibitions internationally. FA’s work has raised public awareness around this specific case, impacted German society’s wider reckoning with the ‘far right’, tangibly benefitted Yozgat’s family, and immigrant communities and anti\-racism activists across Germany and raised cultural awareness of state culpability and the use of counter forensics and curatorial practice to challenge injustices. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In 2006, Halit Yozgat was shot dead in an internet café in Kassel, Germany by members of a neo\-Nazi group known as the National Socialist Underground \(NSU\). Their exposure in 2011 led to a five\-year criminal trial and a nationwide reckoning with what became known as the ‘NSU Complex’ – structural racism that systemically ignored the experience of Germany’s immigrant communities, typified in this case by uncomfortable connections between police, spies, and the neo\-Nazi underground. 

 In 2016, an alliance of civil society organisations known as ‘Unravelling the NSU Complex’ commissioned FA to investigate Yozgat’s murder **\[3.1\].** The questions at the heart of the case were particularly accessible by FA’s research methods, developed by its founder\-director Professor Eyal Weizman **\[3.2\]**. Technically, the approach is founded upon architectural tools, including using 3D digital models to arrange and examine media evidence. Theoretically, the approach is based in ‘counter forensics’, turning the tools of forensic investigation back toward the actions of the state, and ‘open verification’, developing evidentiary material in an open, explanatory and ‘socialised’ fashion. Together, these approaches unpick the claims of state agents in relation to acts of violence, and show their weaknesses and contradictions, in alliance with the communities affected by that violence **\[3.3\].** 

 FA examined open\-source documents from the police investigation, including the computer login times of every customer in the café, and a video of the agent, Andreas Temme, re\-enacting his route out of the café. Temme insisted he had left the café before the killing and had not witnessed it. In 2006, the police and courts took his word. 

 To interrogate whether Temme could have been lying, FA reconstructed the café as a digital model, and as a physical 1:1 scale model installed at Berlin’s House of World Cultures \(HKW\) gallery. Login data and witness testimony narrowed down the moment of the shooting. 
 

 *Image \[1\]: Using the login times of every computer in the café, FA demonstrated who could have been present at the time of the shooting.* 

 The models became venues for synthesising analysis; FA reconstructed the movements of individuals, and overlaid them with evidence from fluid dynamics experts \(from HazeLab at Imperial College\) and audio forensics specialists, to determine whether Temme would have seen the murderers, heard the gunshots, or smelled the gunpowder **\[3.4\]**. FA precisely tested the audibility of gunshots in the space and simulated the distribution of odorous gunpowder to determine a ‘threshold of detectability’. FA concluded that Temme was present at the time of the murder, and would have heard the gunshot, smelled the gunpowder, and seen Yozgat’s body as he exited, according to the route he claimed to have taken. Temme’s testimony, therefore, was false. 

 In 2017, FA’s findings were presented at Documenta14, a major international art exhibition, held in the town in which Yozgat was killed **\[3.5\]**. Sharing findings publicly is critical to FA’s practice: not only is FA mandated to disseminate its methodologies, in pursuit of a robust civil society capacity for forensics, but Weizman also notes similarities between forensics and curatorial practice, which share concerns around knowledge production, the presentation of ideas, and the arrangement of evidence and objects **\[3.2\].** In this way, FA’s exhibitions have a political function, raising public awareness of injustices and empowering civil society to pursue state accountability, while merging cultural practice with investigative process changes the role of both: cultural institutions become spaces of forensics \(following the Latin *forensis*, ‘pertaining to the public forum’\), and curatorial activities carry weight within legal environments. The Case of Halit Yozgat featured in FA’s award\-winning exhibition ‘Counter Investigations’, at London’s ICA **\[3.6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The investigation has had three main areas of impact. Firstly, the evidence challenged the state’s account of Yozgat’s murder. Secondly, it has raised the public’s awareness of the ‘NSU Complex’ and the culpability of the German state, proposing concrete new techniques to interrogate that culpability. Thirdly, the investigative process has informed new modes of curatorial practice in the cultural and creative sector through a series of award\-winning exhibitions that have resulted in a wider understanding of how civil society groups can use FA’s techniques to challenge injustices. 

  

 **Impact 1: New evidence challenges the state narrative** 

 FA’s findings demonstrably changed public and professional opinion about the state’s culpability concerning the NSU case **\[5.1\] \[5.3\] \[5.4\]**. This has benefited the Yozgat family’s pursuit of justice and accountability \(though more remains to be done\), as well as immigrant communities in Germany and other victims the NSU, and activists and political figures who seek to challenge systemic and institutional racism and the violence they perpetuate **\[5.3\]**. 

 In 2017, the family’s lawyers attempted to present FA’s evidence before the court in the trial of the remaining members of the NSU. A technical error by a third party ultimately excluded the contribution, but the work was referred to specifically by the lawyers of the group’s victims in their closing arguments, and in two parliamentary processes **\[5.1\] \[5.2\]**. In Hessen, following the presentation of FAs video report to the inquiry committee in August 2017, a senior member of that committee admitted to the existence of more accurate records of the login times from the internet café \(referred to above; and explained in detail in *The Intercept’s* report **\[5.4\]**\). These had been contained in a previously undisclosed 2008 federal police report and, as a result of FA’s work, were released into the public domain, providing the general public with a more precise picture of what had occurred that day. 

 These references and engagements underscore the significance of FA’s contribution not only for the family of the victim, and their ongoing quest for accountability, but also for political parties in Germany including Die Linke, and advocacy groups connected to the case who gained a better understanding of its complexity **\[5.2\] \[5.3\].** 

 **Impact 2: Exhibitions raise public awareness of state culpability** 

 FA’s investigation, and its coverage in media and cultural spaces, contributed to the enduring value of tribunal events around Germany that gave activists and civil society groups a forum to highlight how immigrant communities experience structural racism and racist violence in modern Germany. FA’s investigative approach continues to be cited by those groups **\[5.3\]**. 

  

 The work of FA is often disseminated via art exhibitions including the Documenta14 exhibition in 2017 **\[3.5\]** which was attended by 850,000 people and gave FA’s findings and techniques substantial exposure. Interest in the case and FA’s work was reflected in media coverage both in Germany and internationally **\[5.4\]**. Subsequent increased public scrutiny, supported by subsequent exhibitions such as Kunsthaus Nuremberg's ‘The Labyrinth: An exhibition on the NSU Complex’ \(2019\) placed FA’s work, and the NSU killings, in the context of far\-right violence in modern Germany. This has not only exposed critical questions pertaining to a racist murder, but also offered new possibilities for civil society’s investigative capacity. 

 Lawyer Andreas Schueller, Director of the International Crimes and Accountability Programme of the Berlin\-based legal NGO the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights \(ECCHR\) confirmed the significance of FA’s exhibitions. Quoted in *Icon* in 2018 he stated: 

 ‘For us, it’s incredibly powerful because we are mostly lawyers whose work never leaves the printed page \[…\] It also benefits the family and wider immigrant community who have been exposed to racist violence, as the exhibitions publicly acknowledge the suffering and represent an opportunity for them to open up and receive some form of closure’ **\[5.5\]**. 

 **Impact 3: ICA Exhibition challenges artistic and curatorial convention** 

 The case was also part of a major exhibition of FA’s work at London’s ICA gallery **\[3.6\]**. 
 

 *Image \[2\] FA’s work ‘The Killing of Halit Yozgat’ exhibited at London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts.* 

 The ICA exhibition won the Design Museum’s overall Design of the Year award and first prize in the digital category in 2018. Judges commended FA for inventing ‘a new paradigm in the search for the truth’. Writing for RIBA Architectural Review, Pamela Buxton acknowledged FAs ‘hugely important work for NGO’s, charities and citizens groups by enabling them to challenge official narratives in the quest for truth’ **\[5.6\].** 

 Commenting on the artistic and curatorial impact of the ICA exhibition, Stefan Kalmar, ICA Director, stated: 

 ‘What Forensic Architecture propose is a different language. It’s a different set of tools to understand the world and change perspectives. Is it art, journalism, documentary film\-making, or architecture? Maybe it’s all of the above or maybe it’s a new art form’ **\[5.7\].** 

 In 2018, Forensic Architecture was nominated for the Turner Prize, and praised by the jury for: 

 ‘developing highly innovative methods for sourcing and visualising evidence relating to human rights abuses around the world, used in courts of law as well as exhibitions of art and architecture’ **\[5.8\].**

<p>The research contributed to a re-evaluation of The New Humanitarian (TNH), a key media news source for policymakers and the humanitarian aid sector. These changes led humanitarian agencies to pay attention to ‘forgotten crises’, leading to action that would otherwise not have been offered. Most notable is the TNH’s reporting on the ‘overlooked’ March 2018 Yazidi healthcare crisis in Iraq. This reporting resulted in immediate action from the UN migration agency and Doctors Without Borders, among others. By the end of 2018, the main hospital serving the Yazidi minority had been moved to a safer and better-equipped facility and acquired new ambulances. TNH doubled their citation of ‘local experts’ in coverage between 2015-2017 and increased the proportion of ‘investigative’ or ‘campaigning’ journalism in their outputs. This helped humanitarian professionals develop policies that address the most urgent challenges in remote crises. For example, a 2018 TNH investigation into alleged chronic corruption in the UN’s resettlement process in Sudan caused the UN’s refugee agency to suspend resettlement operations there subject to further review. TNH’s reformed reporting has impacted the aid sector at an institutional level. For example, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and others have used TNH as a source when lobbying the UN Human Rights Council for an inquiry into abuse against the Rohingya.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Commissioned by Literature Wales and supported by the British Council, ‘Dylan Live’ was a touring multi\-media performance based on Williams’ research on Dylan Thomas. Creative artists developed collaborative practices and benefitted from career\-enhancing new material and performances. Audiences in Wales, London and New York gained an awareness of the bilingual contexts of Thomas’ work and a new understanding of his influence on American culture. The show resulted in Wales’ national literature promotion agency developing an arts strategy that emphasised global collaborations based on creative practice. The Welsh Government featured ‘Dylan Live’ in its educational platform leading to KS3 and KS4 pupils’ knowledge of Thomas’ transatlantic impact. 
","
-  **Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research on Dylan Thomas’ reception, impact and influence on the United States built on Williams’ research on transatlantic culture. While anecdotal evidence of Thomas’ influence on the America of the 1950s and 60s was plentiful \(from John Berryman sitting vigil at Thomas’s deathbed to Robert Zimmerman adopting the Welsh poet’s name in creating his stage persona\) it had never been fully collated, documented nor explored. 

 Professor Daniel G. Williams began this work with Professor M. Wynn Thomas in a publication of 2003 \[R1\]. From the outset, their research had a creative dimension for they contacted living poets, from W. S. Merwin to Ishmael Reed, and American critics such as Helen Vendler, who testified to Thomas’s impact on their work. This work led Williams to pursue \(in \[R2\] and \[R3\]\) the connections between Charlie Parker and Dylan Thomas, the ‘two ruined Titans’ who American poet Kenneth Rexroth believed were the ‘heroes of the post\-war generation’. Williams, a semi\-professional saxophonist, drew on his musical and literary expertise to document the many instances where Thomas was compared to the alto saxophonist Parker, and to explore the ways in which both artists were viewed as romantic primitives, sources of Celtic and Black revitalisation for an ‘over\-civilised’ United States. Drawing on musical, oral and literary sources held at the National Library of Wales and the Harry Ransom Centre in Texas, Williams traced the ways in which Thomas’ ground\-breaking recordings were connected to the rise of spoken\-word poetry and explored the affinities between this Anglophone son of Welsh\-speaking parents and the Jewish\-American Ginsberg, Breton\-American Kerouac, and African American Baraka. The ‘American’ Dylan was simultaneously a poet of the universal \(of love, death, birth and sex\) and a poet whose voice \- especially in recording and performance \- seemed to embody a yearning for ethnic authenticity \[R3\]. 

 Based on this research, Williams was invited by Literature Wales to arrange an evening included in their tourism programme \(‘Writers on Tour’\). The well\-attended performance at ‘Wrights Food Emporium’, Carmarthenshire, on 20th July 2013, combined a lecture on Dylan in 1950s New York with performances of the period’s music by Williams’ quintet ‘Burum’. Williams sought to relate aspects of Thomas’ poetry to specific compositions by Charlie Parker in preparation for the event, thus gestating the interdisciplinary methodology of ‘Dylan Live’. The Literature Wales Chief Executive and staff in attendance recognised the potential that this work had to establish synergies between the academic and creative worlds, and to engage non\-academic and younger audiences. The July 2013 performance\-lecture thus became the prototype for the ‘Dylan Live’ creative\-critical collaborative show commissioned by Literature Wales as part of the Welsh Government ‘Dylanwad/Developing Dylan 100’ programme of educational engagement established during Thomas’s centenary year of 2014. \(GBP21,000, with further funding from the British Council, Arts Council of Wales and Welsh Books Council\). 

 Drawing on their experience of arranging and hosting literary events Literature Wales brought Williams into collaboration with the Welsh\-language poet Aneirin Karadog, the Young People Laureate for Wales \(2013\-16\) Martin Daws, spoken word poet Zaru Jonson, jazz bassist Huw V. Williams, Beatbox musician Ed Holden and animator Ewan Jones Morris. In a series of workshops and a live audience trial \(Millennium Centre, Cardiff, December 17, 2013\) the ‘Dylan Live’ team developed a compositional methodology which brought moments of intercultural interaction drawn from Williams’ research \[R2 and R3\] to life via readings, new poems, music and animation.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 ‘Dylan Live’ has enriched artistic practice, enhanced public knowledge, influenced arts strategy, and resulted in educational outreach. **Artistic practice**. The innovative interdisciplinary model developed by Williams and his collaborators during autumn 2013 and described in Section 2, enhanced the careers, incomes and practices of the artists commissioned to work on ‘Dylan Live’ \(initial budget, GBP21,000\) \[C1\]. Cultural practice is generally divided linguistically in Wales. ‘Dylan Live’ broke this mould, allowing poets to **speak to different constituencies** and to reach wider audiences. The Welsh and Breton poet Karadog has emphasized how ‘my understanding and knowledge of Thomas’s life and work deepened through working on Dylan Live’, confirming that ‘this, in turn influenced my writing’. Karadog’s volume *Bylchau* \(2016\) \- containing the poems ‘Llythyr i Dylan’ and ‘Llaregub’ written for the ‘Dylan Live’ show \- won the Welsh Book of the Year Poetry Award 2017 \[GBP1000\]. While Karadog developed an appreciation of Wales’s Anglophone tradition by working on the show, Englishman Daws’s involvement facilitated a sense of **integration** in Wales as an artist and citizen: ‘As an English incomer to Wales this has been of great personal and professional value to me. Much of the benefit I have been fortunate to draw from our collaborative work is evident in my collection of North Wales poems *Geiriau Gogs* \(2016\)’.  For the bilingual Jonson working on Dylan Live ‘gave me a very tangible and in\-depth sense of a cultural legacy and wider fate which I was falling into by doing what I'm doing in Wales’. \[C2\] The emphasis on ‘crossing’, ‘depth’ and ‘cultural legacy’ speaks to **a creative process that transformed self\-identification and poetic practices**. 

 **Public knowledge.** ‘Dylan Live’ reached 2,300 people via 11 performances in Wales, London and New York \(in addition to over 700 views on YouTube\) \[C1 / C3\]. All performances generated responses on social media with the initial impact of the show indicated by those tweeters who were ‘still buzzing’ or having not ‘quite got over the “Dylan Live” performance’ that was ‘a multimedia gem’ \[C4\]. Critics and reviewers recognised the scope and intent of the performance. *New Welsh Review* was one of several to observe that the layered, hybrid performance ‘operates as much to explode our ideas about form as to challenge our idea of who Thomas was’ and a critical overview of the Centenary activities described ‘Dylan Live’ as a ‘major highlight’ resulting in an awareness of ‘Thomas’s legacy on Wales and the USA’ \[C5\]. The other UK performances in 2014 were at festivals: the Fitzrovia Festival \(London\); the Dinefwr Festival \(Carmarthen\) where it was part of a diverse programme that resulted in the event being named **Best Small Event at the National Tourism Awards for Wales in 2015** \[C1\]; the UK\-wide Being Human Festival, where ‘Dylan Live’ was central to the series of funded \[GBP1,000\] ‘rediscovering Dylan’ events at Swansea University being **shortlisted for the Times Higher Education award** for ‘excellence and innovation in the arts’ \[C6\]. The show’s broader impact was indicated by it being chosen **and featured by the Welsh language magazine programme** *Heno* as one of the highlights of 2014 in its end of year overview broadcast on New Year’s Eve \[watched by an audience of 38,600, approximately 15% of the total Welsh\-speaking population\] where it was noted that the show resulted in new ways of understanding Dylan’s influence on America \[C7\]. 

  

 The **British Council**, who attended the live audience trial in December 2013, incorporated ‘Dylan Live’ into its major **international programme** for the Dylan Thomas Centenary, allocating a ‘significant proportion of the overall budget of GBP729,375’ on the basis that it ‘offered an opportunity for the British Council to complement the work and investment of national partners in Wales, while reaching new global collaborators and audiences.’ \[C3\]. ‘Dylan Live’ was selected as part of the British Council’s contribution to the **PEN World Voices Festival** in New York \(2014\) The eminent Irish poet **Paul Muldoon** introduced the show reflecting its status in the festival and the cast worked with Sarah Montague \(Senior Producer, WNYC Radio\) who praised the performance’s ‘adventurous and innovative mode’, noting that it sparked her to visit Williams’ website, ‘to look for your books’ \[C8\]. Critic Laurie Muchnik was among the audience of 200 at the New York performance and celebrated the ‘multimedia Dylan Thomas’ in the leading American book magazine *Kirkus Reviews*. She noted that the performance resulted in an **enlarged understanding of the different forms literature could take in the contemporary world, thus preparing the ground for new texts and audiences** \[C5\]. 

 **Arts strategy**. ‘Dylan Live’ had a far\-reaching impact on the arts strategy of Literature Wales. Chief Executive Lleucu Siencyn reports that the ‘tri\-lingual \(English\-Welsh\-Breton\) explorations of “Dylan Live” **inspired and informed** Literature Wales’s involvement in Celtic language events during the UNESCO Year of Indigenous Languages \(2019\)’ and that the New York performance of Dylan Live ‘ **enabled Literature Wales to establish an ongoing working relationship with PEN** festival, which resulted in further collaboration with Welsh authors, including former National Poet of Wales Gillian Clarke’. \[C1\]. Furthermore, the experience of commissioning ‘Dylan Live’ **influenced the strategic direction of Literature Wales**: ‘“Dylan Live” schooled Literature Wales in the management and production of experimental cross\-arts production, and was instrumental in a shift in our role, from the funder of events to a facilitator and innovator, supporting and enabling collaborative projects’. The success of the show ‘coupled with the shift in strategy’ that its success engendered ‘led to our successful push for the feted Roald Dahl centenary event two years later’. \[C1\] 

  

 **Education.** ‘Dylan Live’ features prominently on the **Welsh Government\-commissioned web** platform and app \(http://www.rockandrollpoet.co.uk/\) which provides Dylan Thomas materials for primary and secondary schools \(Key Stages 2\-4\). Williams acted as adviser and the name of the site is inspired by Williams's research \[C9. C10\]. The production company who created the resources, Telesgop, report that ‘Williams played a major role in live events that we filmed’, including several interviews with him in English and Welsh. Telesgop ‘incorporated parts of \[Dylan Live\]’ in order to show the transatlantic connections of Thomas and Williams’s ‘creativity and ability to communicate with the target audience’ had ‘been a huge benefit’ to the project which has since **provided a model for further educational resources** on canonical Welsh writers produced by Telesgop \[C10\]. The ‘Rock and Roll Poet’ has been well\-used by schools and the wider public with 23,598 visitors, 27,490 sessions and 47,627 page views.  The three apps aimed at KS2\-4 have been downloaded a total of 11,411 times. \[C10\] **Schools have welcomed the resources** which enable them to explore key concepts in the new Curriculum for Wales such as **understanding cultural contexts and identities** and particularly valued the ‘simultaneously bilingual approach’ of the resources and the way that ‘Dylan Live’ places ‘a clear emphasis on how Thomas’s verse is shaped by his Welsh identity and aural traditions which are firmly rooted within Welsh culture’. \[C10\] The resources have been used in KS3 and KS4 in secondary schools, leading to, for instance, one Welsh\-medium school in Swansea to **collaborate with a school in Boston MA** as well as conducting a project on Thomas’s Swansea roots.  The Head of English reports that ‘learners frequently reference and use the Rock and Roll poet website when undertaking their own research on Dylan Thomas.’ \[C10\] *The Guardian* newspaper reported the enthusiasm that educator Hannah Ellis \- who is also the granddaughter of Dylan Thomas and Manager of the Dylan Thomas Trust \- expressed for the ‘Dylan Live’ show \[C5\] and she notes that it ‘provided **a new appreciation of my grandfather’s writing to a younger generation**’ and ‘helped develop a public and academic interest in his work’ \[C10\]. 

 The impact of ‘Dylan Live’ is ongoing. As a result of the show, Professor Kurt Heinzelman, University of Texas at Austin, invited Daniel Williams to lecture and teach on Dylan Thomas in America in February 2017. Heinzelman notes that ‘Dylan Live’ ‘illuminated my own research in Welsh writing generally and Dylan Thomas in particular’, and as a result is collaborating with Williams on a co\-taught ‘ **global classroom’** initiative centred on Thomas, and on a **landmark transatlantic project** to digitize the Thomas papers held at Swansea University and the Harry Ransom Centre that will **open this material to a worldwide audience**. \[C10\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Entwistle’s philosophical analysis of ‘collaborative approaches’ to healthcare and ‘support for self\-management’ for people with long\-term conditions has significantly shifted the thinking and practice of clinicians who have engaged with it. Their practical adoption of the central idea of ‘enabling people to live \(and die\) well’ has been positively received by patients, and their professional reflections have benefited from the insights the research provided into the inevitable ethical tensions of person\-centred approaches. The further spread of these benefits is now supported by the adoption of the central idea and associated insights within professional training programmes, NHS and third sector service development work, Scottish health policy and international guidance. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Health services often fall short in terms of respecting and responding appropriately to patients’ humanity. Efforts to make healthcare more ‘person\-centred’ via the promotion of approaches such as shared decision\-making and collaborative support for self\-management have had limited success. Professor Vikki Entwistle recognised that the problems are in large part philosophical, arising from weak characterisations of key concepts. Her research illuminated the conceptual\-theoretical roots of the practical and ethical challenges experienced by clinicians and patients, and developed a new conceptual account of support for self\-management. 

 The research was conducted in collaboration with Professor Alan Cribb \(Kings College London\) between 2012 and 2018. It involved two projects, both funded by The Health Foundation, an independent charity committed to bringing about better health and health care for people in the UK. 

 An initial proof of concept project served to demonstrate how philosophy can inform healthcare improvement. It focused on ‘collaborative approaches’ to care for people with long\-term conditions. It included two knowledge exchange events with health professionals and patient advocates to ensure the philosophical problems were elucidated in practically relevant ways. These events generated nuanced insight into what patients and clinicians consider meaningfully collaborative. 

 This project identified several conceptual\-theoretical problems with prevailing characterisations of collaborative working. Not only do they obscure social\-structural influences on people’s priorities, scope to adopt recommended behaviours and health, they also reflect and foster an impoverished view of relationships between patients and health professionals, and of why these relationships matter. As a result, they lack the conceptual means to differentiate between healthcare that patients and health professionals experience as more and less collaborative, effective and person\-centred \(respectful, responsive and enabling\). 

 The initial project identified several philosophical approaches that could be useful for the development of more adequate accounts of person\-centred and collaborative working. A capabilities approach to thinking about quality of life, which emphasises the salience of what people have genuine opportunities to be and to do, could help accommodate the range of what matters to both patients and health professionals. Relational theorising could reflect and facilitate recognition that patients’ priorities and capabilities are socially and situationally influenced. The resulting ‘Enabling people to live well’ report \[1\] was peer reviewed and published by the Health Foundation. 

 A second, larger, project built constructively from the pilot to develop a new account of support for self\-management \(SSM\) to facilitate the pursuit of more person\-centred approaches in practice. This project included a critical interpretive synthesis of published studies of health professionals’ experiences of SSM \[2\], interviews with 26 health professionals about their work with people with diabetes or Parkinson’s \[3,4\] and five group discussions with health professionals \[3,4\]. Key insights were synthesised in a briefing document that informed six group discussions with policy and service development leads from government, the NHS and third sector, was refined for a larger dissemination event, and developed into an academic article \[5\]. 

 The new account was founded on the drawing of a critical distinction between two \(usually implicit\) views of the **purpose** of SSM: to help people **manage their health conditions** in biomedical terms \(for example to keep blood glucose and blood pressure levels within recommended limits\), and to help people **live \(and die\) well with their health conditions** \[2,5\] **.** The research demonstrated how and why the first, narrower view of purpose could constrain health professionals’ respect for, responsiveness to, and enablement of, patients, for example by keeping a focus on targets that were impossible for many \(health conditions deteriorate and people will die even with the best healthcare and selfcare\) and by leaving little room for what matters to people \(holding down a job, participating in a family celebration etc.\) \[2,5\]. The new account thus centred on the adoption of the broader view of purpose as essential for person\-centred working. 

 A focus on enabling people to live \(and die\) well has several significant benefits. It still allows recognition of the importance of biomedical aspects of condition\-management but keeps these in better perspective. Especially when living \(and dying\) well is understood in terms of capabilities, it also encourages recognition of the broader range of ways in which health professionals can support patients. And it further illuminates how health professionals can disenfranchise and harm patients, for example by conveying blame and shame in response to poor biomedical indicators and \(presumed\) non\-compliance with recommended diet and exercise regimens \[5\]. 

 The research also demonstrated that the plurality and complexity of what makes for living well means that health professionals will inevitably face ethical tensions in pursuit of person\-centred working. Prioritisation among a patient’s and their own multiple, interconnected short and long\-term concerns will often be contested and tricky balances must be struck, for example, when trying to deal respectfully with uncertainties about the accuracy or truth of what patients are saying. The research made the case that these tensions, which had not been acknowledged in policy advocacy or professional training materials, need to be recognised and addressed \[4,5\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The idea of ‘enabling people to live \(and die\) well’ has led to significant improvements across the interacting levels of clinical practice; professional training; service development \(NHS and voluntary sector\), national health policy and international health policy guidance. 

 **Clinical practice** 

 Clinicians who engage with the research recognise its significance and incorporate key insights into their interactions with patients and broader practice. 

 A consultant physician in North East England who participated in knowledge exchange and dissemination events describes here the positive impact of opening up his consultations to attend more flexibly to what matters to each individual patient and what, from their perspective, would enable them to live well with diabetes: 

 “*this has undoubtedly affected the way that I have approached individual consultations… It has resulted in exploration of wider areas that the person attaches value to, a reshaping of my use of language and a more permissive approach to the goals a person may identify. This … has been noticed and commented on by patients and colleagues*” \[a\] 

 In work for the Royal College of Physicians, this physician used key ideas from the research “ *to influence the content of postgraduate clinical examinations, with the incorporation of assessment of the types of conversation that candidates have with patients*”, contributing to the shaping of professional standards more generally \[a\]. 

 A consultant clinical psychologist in South West England, who found the first *Enabling people to live well* report \[1\] on the Health Foundation’s website, illustrates how the philosophical research has helped clinicians understand why person\-centred working can be more difficult in practice than it first sounds. He highlights the value of recognising that some tensions are inevitable. This can help health professionals avoid being inappropriately negatively judgemental or demoralised about their clinical performance. 

 “*There’s no shortage of promotion of personalisation in healthcare literature, but … the missing piece is usually the complexities of ‘how’… as if policy\-makers don’t quite ‘get’ the reality on the ground. I remember reading Enabling people to live well the first time: it was literally jaw dropping. I felt like I’d been waiting my whole career to read something so clearly articulating some of the things I’ve struggled with*” \[b\]. 

 He found this and the subsequent research “ *provide a language and conceptual framework that connects clinically, feels realistic; and is therefore helpful and hopeful*”. He gives copies of three outputs \(\[1,4, and 5\]\) to trainees and qualified psychologists who join his team to “ *acknowledge and give clear description of why these policy areas feel more complex than they seem at first sight*” and “ *add value to our existing thinking*” \[b\]. This clinician also finds the research has enabled him to bring “ *nuance and subtlety*” to discussions between service managers and clinical leaders about “ *the ‘competing’ needs of systems and people*”. He has used it to provide a language to “ *helpfully voice*” and so open up a discussion of practical tensions that were previously difficult to articulate and communicate about \[b\]. 

 These examples show the deep significance of the research findings for clinical practice. 

 **Incorporation into Professional Training and Voluntary Sector Development** 

 The transformative potential of the research is now being realised more generally through incorporation into professional training and service development. 

 The research findings are now reaching a much broader professional audience as a result of their adoption by the Year of Care Partnership \(YOCP\). YOCP provides training and support to NHS teams of varying sizes across the UK \(including at Trust and Scottish Health Board levels\) \[c\]. A former YOCP Director who participated in knowledge exchange and dissemination events reports having been “ *greatly influenced in many aspects of \[the\] work”, appreciating the “great ideas and exposition” and using the briefing document and slides from the final dissemination event “multiple times in discussion and small groups*” \[d\]. YOCP credit the research with leading to their recognition of the importance in training of “Being explicit about purpose” and “Reframing the practitioner role” \[e\]. They have adopted the distinction between supporting people to manage their health conditions well and living well with their health conditions as key, and draw heavily on the research in order to achieve a “better articulation of purpose of CSP” and to “debate tensions around roles and goal setting with practitioners” \[e, a\]. Positive experiences of their training, including among clinicians visiting from abroad, has led to some international spread \[f, a\]. 

 Third sector patient organisations have also used the concepts and analysis from this research in their campaigning and service development activities. For example, the Director of Policy and Care Improvement at Diabetes UK, who participated in a knowledge exchange event and has read subsequent research outputs, reports that Diabetes UK has used ideas from the research, and particularly the view of purpose as enabling people to live \(and die\) well: 

 “*to inform our language, how we approach communications and deliver support to both people with diabetes and health professionals to facilitate better conversations*” \[g\]. 

 **Influencing Scottish Government policy and international advice** 

 Key insights from this research have been incorporated into national policy and the recommendations of a respected international advisory group for health systems. 

 Several policy leads from Scottish Government engaged in group discussions and dissemination events, and the research influenced their work on health literacy, support for self\-management and palliative care \[h,i,a\]. The Chief Medical Officer’s acclaimed *Realistic Medicine* report, which continues to guide service development in NHS Scotland and attract interest internationally, notably adopts the recommended view of purpose, stressing a need for “ *Decisions that help \[people\] live well, and indeed die well, on their own terms*” \[j\]. The author of the relevant section of the report reflects that the research’s articulation of a shift towards medicine as 

 “*an enabler of peoples’ capabilities and autonomy* *has been hugely powerful. ""Enabling people to live, and die, well on their own terms"" has been an elegant and helpful phrase that has subsequently guided both policy and practice with respect to long term conditions and palliative care*” \[i\] 

 Wider uptake and influence of this research will also be encouraged because it has been extensively cited in a major review of strategies for achieving person\-centred health systems by the World Health Organization’s European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies \[k\]. The chapter on support for self\-management concluded that “the emphasis should be on supporting people to manage well \(or live well\) with their condition\(s\) \(broad approaches\)” and highlighted a need for the wider policy framework “to be alert to the potential tensions” \[k\].

There was emphasis on early interventions and preventative measures to relieve pressure on healthcare institutions. Subjects ranged from bioethics and the importance of cultural and religious differences when engaging with healthcare, to improving the IT services facilitating healthcare provision. ","<h6>Designing and implementing a digital platform to reduce A&E peak time demand across the South West through the provision of real time information to empower patient decision-making</h6>
<p>NHSquicker app enabled patients to choose the appropriate type of treatment facility for their condition, given real-time data on A&E/MIU wait times. The app was made available to 1.7 million patients since 2017, with 40,000 patients using it. It has lead to enhanced patient experience of acute care services by improving access to and use of NHS services and reducing A&E pressures during peak periods. Two early adopters of the app, TSDFT and North Devon Healthcare Trust, reported that between 2017-Feb 2019 there was a reduction in A&E attendances and an increase in MIU attendances compared to the previous year. Future work focused on scaling up the app from a regional to a national service, and to use the data collected by NHSquicker to improve the performances of services like Pathway (used by the NHS to triage 111 calls).

<h6>Healthy Universities: A Whole System Approach to Improving Health, Wellbeing and Sustainability in Higher Education</h6>
<p>Using the ‘healthy settings’ approach, involving a holistic and multi-disciplinary method that integrates action across risk factors, the researchers created a Healthy Universities Model trialled by University of Central Lancaster. The healthy universities model has since been adopted by 86 UK HEIs, informed the publication of a Charter for Health Promoting Universities, and the establishment of an International Steering Group chaired by Dooris (an ICS researcher). The International Steering Group has overseen the adoption of the Healthy Universities Model by over 400 universities across 35 countries. This research has also influenced implementations of similar health support models. For example, the University of Sydney introduced Self-Review Tool that facilitated identification of priority areas for action by its 70,000 students and 7,500 staff, and the University of British Columbia pioneered Canadian Action for Healthy Universities, a model informed by this research to prioritise ‘health in all policies’.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Rebecca Arnold has succeeded in engaging a large, diverse public in discussions of fashion history which include findings from her research into the work of lesser\-known fashion designers and models – often people of colour – with new insights from significant and well\-known collections of fashion photography, illustration, and film. Drawing on a wide range of non\-traditional sources, including amateur photography, popular films and previously unpublished correspondence, she has used multiple platforms to share insights with both the interested general public and specialist practitioners which build on an understanding of the importance of the ‘everyday’ alongside haute couture in 20<sup>th</sup> century fashion. Arnold has worked to revise the prevailing white, elite narrative of fashion history and reinterpreted the significance of the media through which fashion is disseminated and discussed. She has also used her research into fashion media to develop ‘Fashion Interpretations’ a network of fashion illustrators, curators, critics and historians who have collaboratively advanced understandings of how the medium – film, illustration, photography, writing, exhibition – impacts on interpretations of fashion, and have influenced each other’s approach to practice, criticism, and analysis. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Rebecca Arnold \(Senior Lecturer in History of Dress and Textiles\) has undertaken extensive research into 20<sup>th</sup>\-century fashion, generating insights into the collaborative work fundamental to the creation of fashion photography \[R2\] and exploring the effects of intersections of professional, amateur and personal photography on representations of women’s fashion in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century \[R1\].  Arnold’s interests in links between medium and representation have led her to work across photography, film, fashion journalism and illustration. She has also explored lesser known sources, including vernacular photography, amateur film making, personal diaries and correspondence, and archives of little\-known designers and photographers. Examining an expanded field of photography has enabled Arnold to explore the work of overlooked photographers, often people of colour, as key sources both for visual and aesthetic analysis and to engage fully with the cultural, social, economic and political contexts within which images of dressed bodies circulate. 

 Arnold’s analyses show how relationships between the artist, subject and viewer differ in each medium, noticeably for example in amateur photography where the three roles are often blurred. Through the analysis of relationships between producers, consumers, viewers and wearers, she expands definitions of agency and gaze in the dissemination of fashion. This has allowed her to highlight issues of identity, inclusivity, and diversity within the representation of fashion and expand the narratives of fashion history from the elite into the everyday. 

 This approach to fashion research has fed into publications demonstrating that fashion photography is a key medium of interaction between creator and viewer \[R3,R4\], and which foregrounds the wearer’s experience as pivotal to understanding fashion and the senses \[R5,R6\]. Arnold’s forthcoming book *Documenting Fashion: Dress and Visual Culture in Interwar America* \(Bloomsbury, 2023\) draws on this to explore the history of fashion in relation to popular visual culture and through the lens of sensory theory. These areas of research have also been explored by Arnold in the two special issues of *Fashion Theory* she proposed and edited which focus on underexplored histories of fashion and groups within the fashion community \- ‘Posing the body’ in 2017 with K. Faulkner, K. Pantelides, and E. Shinkle, and ‘Passing’ in 2020 with E. Kutesko. 

 Arnold’s research into the impact of medium on the reception and interpretation of fashion in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, and her collaboration with Professor Judith Clark \(Professor of Fashion and Museology, London College of Fashion\) led to the AHRC\-funded ‘Fashion Interpretations’ network \(October 2019 – December 2020\). With Arnold as Principal Investigator, its goal was to foreground considerations of medium at a time when digital media was causing major changes in the ways fashion is represented and disseminated. The project encapsulated aspects of Arnold’s research on how fashion’s meanings mutate within and across mediums, and the role of translation and re\-presentation at the core of fashion’s creation for different audiences. 

 The network, with 13 core participants, consisted of fashion journalists, illustrators, authors, designers, stylists, curators and specialists in film, gender, and aesthetics who met regularly to discuss materials and interrogate their individual and intersecting approaches to fashion analysis, criticism, and writing. The network brought together interdisciplinary and international voices to produce new insights into the role of medium in representations and reinterpretations of modern and contemporary fashion, and to explore the potential for collaboration across different forms of media: the digital, the photographic, and the illustrative. Several participants were drawn from the connections Arnold had made through sharing her research on Instagram, where the digital medium had enabled scholarly, academic work to be translated into accessible posts that, both alone and taken together as a feed, had provoked discussions with diverse practitioners.  For Arnold, diversity of discipline, approach and the specific medium, was key; she invited participation from a fashion illustrator, whose drawings of queer culture and fashion questioned the use of traditional drawing versus the digital, and a University of Calgary professor whose research on amateur film, especially of Asian Americans, presented an alternative view of mid\-century American fashion and its representation. This built on Arnold’s research on foregrounding diverse and inclusive histories of fashion. The final output of the group, *Archive Addendum*, was delayed due to Covid\-19 but is due to be shared in Spring 2021. 

 This body of research has emphasised the importance of engaging with a wide range of visual sources and media to ensure inclusivity, particularly in terms of race and class, and to demonstrate an alternative to fashion being presented as an exclusively white, elite practice and industry.

 **4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)** 

 The body of research produced by Arnold on the significance of the visual medium in fashion history, interpretation, and dissemination has meshed strongly with her effective use of social media and podcasting as platforms for conversation and research dissemination tools.  Both have allowed Arnold to distribute her research findings widely through a medium which is accessible and designed for discussion and response. Her Instagram account ‘ [Documenting Fashion’](https://www.instagram.com/documenting_fashion/?hl=en) set up in 2015, had 108,000 followers by December 2020 \[4\].  The account was initially conceived as a research tool to explore how visual analysis written as captions for diverse images from her research could support a decolonised, racially inclusive history of fashion. 

 Arnold’s research is also disseminated through *Bande à part*, a collaborative podcast with Beatrice Behlen \(Senior Curator, Fashion & Decorative Arts, Museum of London\). Established in January 2018, it uses audio to share fashion histories and provides intermedial links to other visual and moving image sources. The listenership is wide: 1,214 listens per week; 379 SoundCloud followers; the most heard episode ‘Love, Cecil’ \(March 2020\) 2,852 listens to date \[10\]. The podcast has an international audience; besides 50,800 UK listens, USA attracted 82,700, Australia 13,100, Mongolia 2,883, and New Zealand 2,311 \[10\]. Arnold’s profile as a prominent fashion historian, achieved through this public dissemination of her research, has led to invitations for expert contributions to mainstream and specialist fashion publications alike since 2015, e.g, being the only fashion historian in the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary edition of fashion magazine *Self Service* in 2019 \[1,2,3\]. She is frequently asked to comment on issues as diverse as whitewashing nostalgia in American West fashion trends \(Vogue, 2018\), the political nuances of women’s power suit \(Bustle, 2019\), and the social context of jewellery \(NYT, 2017\) in mainstream publications including the Independent, Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue international editions \[3\]. She has been asked by major fashion brands, including Cos, to write articles which integrate fashion history with current fashion trends \[2\]. 

 Both Instagram and podcast have been well received by non\-academic audiences engaging with fashion history. Arnold’s ‘Documenting Fashion’ account frequently appears in ‘must follow’ Instagram lists compiled by designers such as Christian Lacroix, and non\-academic fashion writers \[4\]. She appeared as one of ‘The Most Influential Women in Sewing in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century’, alongside designer Vera Wang; specific reference was made to her accessible Instagram approach which ‘ *break\[s\] down the nuances of fashion, both everyday and haute couture, for home sewists and consumers*’ and that her feed was ‘ *definitely a must for any aspiring designers’*. \[4\]. Organisations, such as the Jeu de Paume gallery, approached Arnold to participate in Instagram takeovers relating to fashion and imagery because of her engagement with and use of the platform. She integrates Instagram into her public events, inviting participants to engage with it as a new medium of fashion interpretation \[4\]. A participant in the Fashion Interpretations symposium invited to use Instagram to explore her research said ‘ *it was so challenging to take over the Fashion Interpretations Instagram – for me it was a new genre of scholarly activity’* \[7\]. 

 The *Bande à part* podcast has featured in numerous ‘best of’ lists, including Vogue, the Guardian, and IT Fashion \[5\]. Reviewers praise it for making academic content accessible and enriching their understanding of fashion history: ‘ *The charm and rapport between its cohosts make it as accessible as podcasts come’*; ‘ *Arnold and Behlen wear their erudition lightly, but their knowledge and experience always shine through’*; ‘ *The laid back but thoroughly well informed discussions in this podcast have provided an amazing entry point for me to understand and appreciate fashion’* \[5\]. One reviewer particularly noted that *Bande à part* gives ‘ *a much better idea of how fashion historians work, and the trains of thought and research they have’* \[5\]. 

 The ‘Documenting Fashion’ account has had positive impact on public attitudes towards diverse and inclusive racial representations of fashion and fashion history. Sharing images drawn from her research, from fashion photography, film, and illustration at professional, amateur, and personal levels, Arnold presents a racially diverse range – whether models and or individuals in everyday situations – ensuring people of colour are represented in the fashion histories she explores and disseminates. By connecting such images to her research resources and insights, she draws attention to underexplored histories, empowering her audience to learn more. The platform allows for comments and insights from followers, which Arnold often integrates into her captions to further enhance their educational impact. Instagrammers of colour, who share this interest in diversity, particularly within fashion, direct their own followers to ‘Documenting Fashion’ as a source of information and imagery for diverse histories of fashion. The host of the podcast *Shade,* which focuses on representation and creativity, has stated that Arnold *‘upholds all of our stories’* in her work \[9\]. Followers have expressed their deep engagement with her attention to issues of representation in fashion history: *‘I really truly love what you’ve been doing. Black joy, black expression, black fashion and art are all something to celebrate’*; ‘ *The power in your feed in recent weeks is breathtaking: your choice of images and pared back commentary screams quietly “POC are here and always will be here”’.* Others note that Arnold’s public dissemination of diverse, inclusive research materials and findings has shaped their own presentation of fashion histories on Instagram and in blogs and podcasts. One follower included Arnold in a list of Instagrammers who *‘are helping me to better understand and be a better educator’* \(June 2020\) in the realm of racism in the fashion industry, and the host of the fashion podcast *Dressed: The History of Fashion* and writer of the blog *The Art of Dress* stated in January 2017 that Arnold ‘ *explore\[s\] such a diverse range of subjects’* and has ‘ *really been instrumental in expanding \[beyond\] the singular ‘white’ history of fashion so often propagated’* and asked Arnold for further ‘ *suggestions of digitized visual resources for more diverse non high\-fashion images’* \[9\] 

 This approach has led to the development of strong working relationships with fashion practitioners – designers, stylists and critics – with similar interests. The resonance of themes of race and ethnicity in her Instagram and the ‘ *well thought out analysis’* of her podcast led to connections with *The Conversations,* a fashion and culture podcast with concerns around fashion and representation, particularly for young Black fashion professionals \[8\] and with founding members of  [‘The Kelly Initiative’](https://thekellyinitiative.net/),  a network of Black fashion professionals working to make the industry more equitable. Both cited the influence of Arnold’s research and approach to imagery and continue to discuss representation, inclusivity, identity and the fashion industry’s shifting engagement with varied media with her. Arnold was the first guest on *The Conversations* podcast in January 2018 and invited the hosts to record a further episode at The Courtauld with an audience of fashion journalists, design and fashion\-history students, academics, curators and members of the public, many Arnold’s Instagram followers \[8\] with active discussion at both events. Arnold also provided guidance for the 17 October 2019 *Business of Fashion* OpEd ‘ [Inclusivity Demands More Than a Show](https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/luxury/inclusivity-demands-more-than-a-show)’ written by one of *The Conversations* hosts, a fashion stylist and the founder of the JC Report, a major international fashion trend website \[8\]. 

 Arnold’s research had a two\-fold impact through the *Fashion Interpretations* AHRC\-funded network. The primary impact was through strong working connections created between participants, both from academia and the wider fashion industry. Each contributed a discrete project within the network themes, drawing on their disciplinary or practical approaches to media – as curators, illustrators, editors, writers, and stylists. This interdisciplinary, inter\-institutional group arose from individual connections Arnold had formed through participants’ engagement with her research through ‘Documenting Fashion’. Arnold deliberately instigated Instagram takeovers and blog posts, creating collaboration between different network participants to bring together diverse perspectives and expertise, hosting online meetings to share work in progress. Through this process, she created space for conversations around hitherto unexplored links between members’ different bodies of research, artwork and writing. One stated: it was ‘ *exciting to see the unexpected connections’.* Another called Arnold ‘ *visionary*’, adding ‘ *you made this happen’* \[7\]. Members reported on collaborations they had undertaken. A fashion illustrator sketched mannequins styled by a museum curator, who found it ‘ *energizing*’ in returning movement to the stillness found in exhibitions. A fashion editor observed that engaging with the work of curators raised ‘ *issues of…grouping together of images, which as an editor, is part of my job’* \[7\]. The final network outcome \- the inaugural issue of *Archivist Addendum \(COVID\-19* delayed, forthcoming 2021\), edited by two network members and responding to the network – is a new type of publication. Presented in an archive box, showcasing interpretations of members’ work in a variety of different media, it provides a platform for approaches to fashion journalism, history, and criticism that engage with new mediums of representation. 

 The second group impacted by the network were the public, who were able to attend a five\-night online symposium ‘Fashion Interpretations: Dress, Medium and Meaning’ hosted by Arnold \(30 November – 4 December 2020\) marking the end of the project. Project members reflected on their individual contributions to the network themes. Over 850 attendees, with international spread \[6\], responded positively to the Covid\-necessitated online format. Many who might otherwise have been unable to attend for geographical, family or accessibility reasons reported a feeling of inclusion \[6\]. The network participants’ strong sense of connection was mirrored by audience members who noted that it *‘felt more like community building than the typical academic conference* *event’*. \[6\]. The content was ‘ *Very informative \[…\] inspirational’*; they were ‘ *inspired to look for new ways to see fashion in its manifestations’* and ‘ *have since done some research into artists and images’* that were previously unfamiliar. One said it ‘ *gave me new tools for the future I want’;* another said ‘ *the diversity of perspective and approaches felt “just in time”’.* Many expressed a desire for further online events hoping that the Fashion Interpretations network would continue in the future; others praised the ‘ *emotional responses’* of the participants to their research, stating that they ‘ *felt really connected on a personal level*.’ One museum professional noted how important the symposium had been in ‘ *helping me grapple with some essential issues I'm having about what our Museum should be doing and how we should be doing it*.’ \[6\]

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The ESRC funded *Food for Thought* \(FFT\) project has transformed ‘food practices’ among practitioners caring for ‘looked after’ children in the UK and internationally by changing how food in care settings is performed and by altering national and local policies. The term ‘food practices’ encompasses the rituals and routines that develop around the preparation, provision and eating of food. The project showed that by better understanding and harnessing the therapeutic potential of food practices, the care given to children is transformed. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Prior to FFT, practices regarding research on food and looked after children focused purely on nutrition and health \(cf. Polnay et al. 1996, Hobbiss 1998, The Caroline Walker Trust 2001\). FFT created a wider understanding and greater awareness in the ‘looked after children’ sector of the ways food is used by adults and children as a form of resistance and surveillance \(see **R6**\), to symbolise and communicate care \(see **R4**\), express feelings \(see **R3**\), and explore and improve relationships \(see **R1**\). 

 To make these findings relevant to policy and direct practice the FFT team and key stakeholders co\-developed a range of materials and practice resources \( *Aberlour Child Care Trust*, *Perth and Kinross Council*, *Foster Care Associates*\). Across the UK, Finland, Ireland and Australia, FFT materials, such as the reflective tool \(a guided resource to support understanding of the child and practitioner’s behaviours around food\), were embedded in the training and supervision of residential and foster carers and new adoptive parents. In turn leading to a redesign of national and local residential child care policies in relation to food in these places. 

 **The centrality of food: how we widened the focus** 

 Starting with Emond’s ethnographic research on residential children’s homes, our exploration of food and food practices broke new ground as it focused on the importance and innate power of the everyday social and emotional use of food in residential care rather than its nutritional value. 

 We built on this in the *Food in Care Study* \(FaCS\) 2006–2009 \(also ESRC funded and graded *Outstanding*\) which comprised an ethnography of food and food practices in three residential children’s homes in Scotland and explored the ways in which food was employed by those living and working in these settings \( **R5**\). This work \(available as a staff handbook and children’s leaflet\) highlighted the routine and taken\-for\-granted ways that children and adults used food, and the activities around food to communicate thoughts and feelings, make relationships, create a sense of belonging as well as resist rules and expectations \(see examples below\). For these children in care and their carers, food was one of the few safe and acceptable ways to do so in this regulated and institutional environment \( **R6**\). 

 Following FaCS, we were approached by a number of social workers, residential and foster carers and new adoptive parents asking for more information about the project and ways that they could apply the ideas and insights from FaCS to their practice. This was a much wider reach than we had anticipated, as we had initially focused on residential carers. We then collaborated with key stakeholders, developing a follow\-on funded project FFT \(ESRC funded 2012\). On the basis of demand from the sector, we expanded the resources to have relevance to foster carers and new adopters hence widening both the focus \(to include other forms of care\) and impact \(to involve different types of care providers\). Alongside this, FFT generated original and influential research \( **R1**, **R2**\) and practice outputs which changed the ways in which food practices in foster and residential care are understood and used.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 **Creating resources for changing practice and understanding** 

 By bringing forth an awareness of the, often hidden, power and centrality of food practices within care contexts and relationships, FFT emphasised how significant improvements in care experiences could be achieved through easily implemented changes \( **R4**\). It added to the knowledge base and skill set of residential and foster carers, as well as their managers and supervising social workers in the UK, Finland, and Australia \( **R2**\). This was achieved primarily through five freely available resources at  [http://www.foodforthoughtproject.info](http://www.foodforthoughtproject.info/): 

-  Online Interactive Introduction \(for initial awareness raising\), 

-  Reflective Workshop Materials \(Facilitators' Pack/Handouts – initially delivered by the project team\), 

-  Reflective Tool and Guidance \(for use with specific children/young people\), 

-  JOTIT Notebook \(an easy\-to\-use way of tracking food practice and reflecting on its use\), 

-  Peer Support Guidance \(for group learning and sharing around food practices\). 

 To maximise the impact on practice, the team ran 9 ‘train the trainer’ events in Scotland. From these, locally based practitioners delivered the Reflective Workshops and promoted the FFT resources within their own geographical areas \(across Scotland and England\). The FFT team was invited to deliver the same workshops in Australia, Ireland, and USA. The team also facilitated 25 peer\-support groups in Scotland and Australia which again have been embraced by organisations \(e.g., SWiSS foster care, Wesley Mission\) as a means of supporting staff and carers. One of the original FaCS resources, the Staff Handbook, was translated into Finnish for use by residential and foster carers. To date, impact has taken place across five key areas: 

##  Reconceptualising food and care 

 **A\)** FFT has been instrumental in transforming thinking in relation to food and care and decisively shifting the practice focus from simply nutrition \( **S1**, **S6**\) to broader concerns including: 

 **The relationship between food and power/control:** *‘It \[FFT\] made me think of all the times that we’d been in places where food is locked away … I did that, I was part of the power and control and feel terrible about it.*’ \(Josef, Residential Worker, Australia, questionnaire\) 

 **Personal histories and meanings of food:** *‘I need to think more about how the experiences she has had in the past have affected her eating habits and how she is now.’* \(Jess, Foster Carer, Scotland, questionnaire\) 

 **The role of food in making and testing relationships: **‘**it \[now\] makes sense of why she won’t eat with us. It’s all so new for her.’ \(John, Residential Worker,* Australia *,* questionnaire *\)* 

 **Food as a means of resisting and expressing care:** ‘ *Knowing what he likes for tea or in his packed lunch and making sure that’s what I give him can be a small but massive way to show I care about him. It’s so obvious but I hadn’t thought about it before* \[FFT\]’. \(Allie, Foster Carer, Scotland, questionnaire\) 

 **B\)** From the evaluation data, individuals reported that by embracing the FFT philosophy and training, staff and carers moved from fixed food routines and procedures to more flexible, child\-centred approaches. They reported staff and carers’ increasing awareness of messages communicated via food, shifting concerns about healthy eating and eating disorders to a broader awareness of the relational and emotional aspects of food practices \( **S1**, **S8**, **S9**\). How easily the FFT recommendations could be implemented, and how they result in significant positive changes, came as a revelation to practitioners: 

 ‘ *… it \[FFT\] made me think about food differently ... when their \(children’s\) food habits change just even slightly it can tell you a lot. I wouldn’t have picked up on that before.’* \(Evaluation interview \- Foster Carer, Scotland, **S2**\) 

 **C\)** FFT has impacted the monitoring and evaluation of care more broadly. By encouraging professional and regulatory attention on food, far greater insight into the overall care experience has been gained. One of the key findings from the FaCS study showed that knowing about food practices says a great deal about care practices. This has influenced the content of assessments and recommendations made about children’s lives: 

 *‘\[as a result of FFT\] I find myself picking up on observations made about food practices when I’m in the child’s place of residence. I find myself having regular conversations with children/young people about food routines where they live which leads to me building up a picture of their world.’* 

 \(Testimonial \- Children’s Safeguarder \*similar to the role of Guardian ad litum, Scotland, **S8**\) 

 In summary, bringing to light the power of everyday practices around food was central to the impact of FFT in changing the food practices of carers. FFT resources have been adopted by key national foster and residential providers in the UK and Australia \(e.g. Aberlour Child Care Trust who support 7,500 children in Scotland, Berry Street, with 1,212 staff and 28,284 service users across Australia and Foster Care Associates who care for 1,853 children across the UK\) where food was rarely considered as having such symbolic and transformative power \( **S7**, **S8**\):  *‘It \[FFT\] really did open up my eyes to how we use food in residential care, and it made me think …  why do we keep the biscuits in the school office locked?’* \(Stage 2 Evaluation Interview \- Service Manager, Scotland, **S2**\) 

##  Transforming practice and care 

 To date, approximately 450 practitioners and carers have taken part in either a FFT reflective workshop or a peer support group \(primarily in Scotland and Australia\), which aimed to raise awareness of using food as a way of connecting to others and building relationships with them: 

 *‘After attending the FFT workshop, we recognised as a care team that we were missing opportunities to connect with the young people using food. … We had some progress with one of our young people … This particular young person also joined us around the table for dinner which has not happened for quite some time. The FFT training has really opened our eyes to seeking opportunities that we can use food to build relationships and connect.’* \(Evaluation Interview \- Residential Worker, Australia, **S2**\) 

 Evaluation data gathered after such training \( **S1**\), 6 months and 3 years later, identified concrete areas of practice that have altered as a consequence of FFT. Analysis of data from the self\-complete evaluation with practitioners and carers in Scotland, England, Ireland and Australia \(n= 318\), identified a range of instrumental, behavioural and conceptual changes produced by FFT, enabling respondents to build stronger emotional and relational connections with the children they care for. We clustered these into key themes including reported shifts in understanding of what was ‘behind’ or causing children’s food behaviour \(65 respondents\); changes to how they talked with children about food \(60 respondents\); changes to routines around food \(53 respondents\); changes to how they use food to communicate more consciously \(28 respondents\); confidence in tackling food issues \(58 respondents\) and change to how they supervise or support staff/carers \(30 respondents\). Significantly, 94% of respondents ranked the FFT materials as ‘Highly’ or ‘Extremely relevant’ to their practice \( **S1**\). 

##  Changing how carers are trained and supported 

 By creating interactive and reflective work and personal based resources, FFT has innovated the ways in which residential and foster carers are trained and supported. Much of existing training has focused on general principles where FFT encourages participants to not only bring the experiences of their children to the sessions but also their own personal experiences of food and food practices.  This model has been picked up by others working in this area. For example, colleagues at Monash University in Melbourne run an online module based on FFT as part of a training programme rolled out across Australia \( **S7**\). Similarly, the Health Inequalities, Food In Care project \(which aims to offer support and practical tools to direct carers of children in looked after care across England \-  [www.foodincare.org.uk](http://www.foodincare.org.uk/)\) has embedded FFT within national training and support materials \( **S4**\) in the ‘food as a symbol section’. They conducted an evaluation project \( **S4**\) which identified that carers had found FFT more helpful than training around nutrition. As one participant said: ‘ *If I knew earlier what I know now after completing the \(FFT\) course, the foster placement that I had last year and another which had broken down after six years would probably still last’* \( **S4**\). 

 More locally, four local authorities in Scotland have reported ways in which they have included FFT in their preparation for adoption training \(e.g. **S6**\) and support and training for kinship and foster care \(e.g. **S5, S9**\). 

##  Impacting policy and practice standards: embedding FFT into inspections 

 The *Scottish Care Inspectorate* \(SCI\), responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of all residential services for children in Scotland, inspect all children’s homes \(308\) and residential schools \(62\) \(totalling 1,477 ‘looked after and accommodated’ children and approximately 8,503 staff\). FFT highlighted the lack of consideration of food practices in the quality indicators used by SCI national inspectors. Following invited presentations and discussions of FFT with the SCI, they included food practices in the monitoring and evaluation tools for residential services for children \( **S3**\). FFT also influenced SCI policy on the need for inspectors and care homes to consider the unconscious, symbolic meanings of food \(SCI Quality Framework June 2019: 23\): 

 *‘Using the food practices resources can contribute to a better understanding of the more intangible aspects of care and the ethos of residential services for children and young people. These resources have now been placed on the Care Inspectorate’s Hub, which provides access to a range of resources aimed at supporting improvement in the social care and social work sectors through the use of research skills and evidence\-led practice. This information will therefore be available both to the inspection team and to others with an interest in providing the highest quality care to Scotland’s children. References to food practices and a link to the research and associated tools is also contained in the Care Inspectorate’s ‘Quality Framework’, which forms part of a new approach to scrutiny, self\-evaluation and improvement support.’* 

 \(Testimonial \- Inspector/Business Analyst, Children & Young People Team, SCI, **S3**\) 

 The FFT website and resources appear in the ‘Scrutiny and Improvement Toolboxes’, part of the SCI national policy document, as well as in the HUB on the SCI website as part of Best Practice Guidance \( **S3**\). 

##  Impact in the wider caring community 

 Initially FFT was designed to target foster and residential carers in Scotland. Reports of change in practice \( **S1**\) have extended to a far more interdisciplinary group than anticipated, including adoptive parents, social workers, service managers, nutritionists, nurses, cooks, policy makers, academics, and adult care support staff. Metrics data show FFT materials downloaded across the globe including UK \(4,120\) USA \(1,192\), Australia \(647\) Brazil \(396\) and India \(199\). By October 2020 the site has been visited by 9,367 people \(Nb. no data was recorded between May\-Sept 2020 due to technical problem with IRISS platform\) \( **S10**\).

contexts, linking these to current policy and practice perspectives. It reveals that food works not only on a material level as sustenance but also on a symbolic level as something that can stand for thoughts, feelings, and relationships. The three broad contexts of schools, families and care (residential homes and foster care) are explored to show the ways in which both children and adults use food. Food is used as a means by which adults care for children and is also something through which adults manage their own feelings and relationships to each other which in turn impact on children’s experiences. The book examines the power of food in our daily lives and the way in which it can be used as a medium by individuals to exert power and resistance, establish collective identities and notions of the self and to express moralities about notions of ’proper’ family routines and ’good’ and ’healthy’ lifestyle choices. It identifies inter-generational and intra-generational differences and commonalities in regard to the uses of and experiences around food across a range of studies conducted with children and young people.

Currently, recognition of the everyday mechanisms that might be contributing to excess weight for children and young people in this setting is limited. The aim of this study was to better understand the barriers and complexities involved in the provision of a \'healthy\' food environment in residential OoHC. Heightening awareness of these factors and how they might compromise a young person\'s physical health, will inform the development, refinement and evaluation of more sensitive and tailored weight-related interventions for this population. The paper presents a nuanced picture of the complexity of everyday food routines in residential care, and illustrates the ways in which food is \'done\' in care; how food can be both symbolic of care but also used to exercise control; the way in which food can be used to create a \'family-like\' environment; and the impact of traumatic experiences in childhood on subsequent behaviours and overall functioning in relation to food. It is argued that a health agenda designed for a mainstream population ignores the very complex relationship that children in residential OoHC may have with food. It is recommended that future intervention approaches account for personal food biographies, trauma and children\'s social backgrounds and how these are implicated in everyday practices and interactions around food."", \'original\': None}', 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Rachael', 'last_name': 'Cox', 'initials': None, 'researcher_id': 'ur.0637231413.40', 'grid_ids': array(['grid.1021.2'],

","<h6>Breakfast research informs national school breakfast provision, local public health breakfast interventions, and Corporate Social Responsibility marketing</h6>
<p>Research demonstrating the positive impact of breakfast consumption on cognitive function, academic performance, and classroom behaviour of children and adolescents. This research led policy change in England, including the expansion of a government funded national school breakfast programme to an additional 650 schools. It also underpinned the process that brought the School Breakfast Bill into Parliament. It has had similar impacts on a food industry-funded national breakfast club programme by Kellogg, expanding to an additional 300 schools. A Local Authority Public Health breakfast intervention has been introduced to ease the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on over 2,500 children in areas of deprivation.

<h6>Food Heritage: Enabling collecting institutions and their communities to shape research and policy on food and food security and contributing to UN-Sustainable Development Goals</h6>
<p>The BigPicnic project addressed food security issues in the context of botanic garden education by exploring the links between food security, plant diversity, and climate change. Hosted in 14 European and 1 Ugandan Botanic Garden in 2016-2019, it showed the role that trusted public institutions like botanic gardens can play in effecting changes to attitude, behaviour, and political response to food and food security. Between 2016-2018, the BigPicnic team have developed 15 exhibitions on food security issues and established 92 science cafés in 59 locations. It has altered the relationship of some European and Ugandan citizens to food and food choices, with 180,000 visitors to BigPicnic events and 6,982 science café users. The project has helped train botanic garden professionals to continue this work, and shaped policy debate around food security in Scotland and Canada.

<h6>Food Ladders: Increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability to food insecurity</h6>
<p>A new food support framework, Food Ladders, has created institutional and policy change. Food Ladders has informed the UK’s planning responses and disaster mitigation approach and has underpinned long-term strategies in over 40 UK charities, including the UK’s largest surplus food redistributor, FareShare. FareShare has increased its long-term funding to £19 million and expanded to work with Asda and Waitrose as well as Tesco. This work has also influenced major producers in the food sector, like GreenCore, whose Sustainability Report and Plan (2020) aims to introduce their community engagement programme, #StartsWithFood, to every site and to donate 100% of surplus to vulnerable communities by 2022. Local authorities have also partnered with the PI, e.g., £1.7million given by the National Institute for Health Research to PI to develop a fruit and vegetable voucher scheme in partnership with Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council.

<h6>Unhealthy food advertising to children: Impacting on a watershed policy</h6>
<p>Research directly informed change of government policy around unhealthy food advertising to children. The research proved that the earlier legislation introduced in 2009 to prevent unhealthy food advertising during children’s television programming was ineffective. The recommendations of the research were taken up by various government bodies and NGOs. The report submitted to the Childhood Obesity Inquiry in 2018 was cited as a major factor in reassessment of the policies, particularly the predictions that a watershed would reduce childhood obesity by around 5% and save the NHS £7,400,000,000. The recommendation of a watershed on unhealthy food advertising was corroborated by the Department of Health and Social Care and the UK Government implemented a 9pm watershed on unhealthy food advertising.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Interdisciplinary research undertaken by **Blundel**, **Schaefer** and **Wahga** at The Open University has addressed the challenge of improving firm\-level environmental performance in small and medium\-sized enterprises \(SMEs\), with a focus on the role played by intermediaries in promoting the adoption of more sustainable processes, technologies and policies. Outputs from this research have influenced professional practice in intermediary organisations and generated evidence\-based tools and learning resources that are facilitating more effective, values\-based engagement with SME owners and managers. The research has also shaped the design of curriculum in HEIs and related student learning experiences in the UK and Pakistan. Impacts have been achieved through: focused interactions with SME owners and managers; collaborative engagement with intermediaries and policymakers; and co\-creation of accredited modules and open educational resources.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 There is a need for small and medium sized enterprises \(SMEs\) to improve their environmental awareness, capability development and performance. Smaller firms have a significant environmental footprint but tend to have fewer resources and are less well\-regulated in comparison to larger firms **\[O1, O2\]**. The research undertaken by **Blundel**, **Schaefer** and **Wahga** \(2009 \- 2018\) has examined these three elements with a specific focus on the catalytic role of intermediaries, such as business advisors, working with \(and in some cases, within\) businesses to promote such changes. They analysed the strengths and weaknesses of dominant policy discourses that seek to promote SME development, pro\-environmental innovations and changes in practice **\[O1, O4\]**; they also challenged the application of exclusively economic, ‘win\-win’ arguments in these contexts **\[O2, O5\]**. The following research outcomes from this body of work contributed to the impacts reported in this case: 

-  Identified key relational and qualitative dimensions of the growth process in small and medium\-sized organisations **\[O3\]**: the *relational* focus \(i.e. the influence of other network actors on firm\-level capabilities and growth\), has informed work on intermediary organisations and SMEs, particularly in relation to longer\-term transitions **\[O1, O4, O6\]**; the *qualitative* focus \(i.e. beyond purely economic goals and success criteria\), has highlighted the importance of personal, professional and organisational values, and the role that values\-based approaches can play in facilitating more effective engagement with SME owners and managers **\[O2, O5\]**. 

-  Highlighted weaknesses in dominant policy discourses that seek to promote environmental innovations and practice changes in SMEs **\[O1, O4\]**; in particular, how over\-reliance on economic, ‘win\-win’ arguments can result in superficial forms of engagement and limited change in firm\-level environmental practices **\[O2, O5\]**. 

-  Argued that short\-term pro\-environmental action by SMEs, based around existing ways of operating, needs to be complemented by longer\-term strategic reorientation towards a more environmentally and socially sustainable growth trajectory **\[O1, O3, O5\]**. 

-  Demonstrated that values\-based engagement is an effective but currently under\-exploited complement to prevailing ‘hard’ approaches to environmental improvement, which focus on technical aspects of new products and practices \(e.g. energy efficiency data\), and on economic justifications \(e.g. availability of subsidies, anticipated payback periods\) **\[O2, O5\]**. 

-  Showed how intermediary organisations can drive environmental performance improvement in developing country contexts by providing SMEs with the micro\-foundations of capability development and compensating for limitations in governmental agency \(i.e. a ‘proto\-institutional’ role\) **\[O6\]**, and by incorporating values\-based approaches into their SME engagement strategies **\[O2\]**. 

 These insights contributed to the impacts detailed in Section 5 through the UK\-based research team’s engagement initiatives with intermediary organisations in Pakistan’s leather industry sector and the creation of an innovative online course and toolkit for business advisors, “Promoting Sustainability in Business”, which was piloted in both countries **\[C10\]**. Much of the underpinning research has been conducted by academics in the Open University Business School’s **Social and Sustainable Enterprise \(SSE\)** research cluster. The doctoral programme has also played a key role in achieving impact, as several former PhD students, including Williams and **Wahga**, have contributed to the research and engagement activity through post\-doctoral fellowships and externally\-funded appointments.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact has been generated by bringing together a series of distinct yet closely inter\-connected research projects, which have addressed SME environmental performance, green innovation and the provision of business support services. The outputs from these research projects have influenced professional practice and generated evidence\-based tools and learning resources that have helped SME owners, managers and intermediaries to adopt more environmentally and socially sustainable practices, while also embedding sustainability imperatives into their longer\-term growth trajectories. Initial work on the cited projects commenced in 2009 with the most significant impacts occurring since 2017. 

 <ins> **The research has informed changes to practice by leading business support organisations in Pakistan**</ins> 

 Research by **Wahga**, **Blundel** and **Schaefer** on promoting environmental responsibility amongst SMEs in Pakistan’s leather manufacturing industry **\[O6\]** builds on earlier work on SME policy, business development, and provision of business support services in developing countries **\[O1, O4\]**. Findings and policy recommendations have been adopted by staff at SMEDA, Pakistan’s national small business support organisation and primary SME policy\-advisory body, who confirmed that: “ *Following the policy framework proposed in **Wahga’s** papers during the trainings that I offer, I* *now advise SMEs how to more effectively engage with environmental issues, for example thorough collaborative investments and environmental learning. Through this, we have inculcated environmental values in a number of new small businesses*” **\[C1a\]**. The OU team also secured Best Paper awards at SMEDA’s International SME Conferences in Lahore 2017 and 2018, the only event of its kind in Pakistan. In 2018 it attracted more than 600 participants from national government departments, international development agencies \(such as JICA\), financial institutions, large scale enterprises, and international SME representative bodies from developed and developing countries, including Bulgaria, China, Japan, South Korea, and the USA **\[C1b, C1c\]**. 

 They have influenced policy and practice in this sector through direct engagement with the three major non\-governmental agencies active in the leather industry \- the Cleaner Production Centres \(CPC\) network, the Pakistan Tanners Association \(PTA\), and WWF\-Pakistan, the national office of this leading global conservation organisation. The Project Manager for the CPC described the impact of reading and engaging with the OU research in these terms: “ *As a policy matter, we have therefore changed our focus of intervention in the industry. Your research has guided and enabled us to establish a network of firms based on their environmental behaviour \[…\] It has had a great impact on our way of approaching SMEs and encouraging them to become eco\-friendly business*” **\[C3a\]**. Further impact on WWF\-Pakistan, which was enhanced through the online course and toolkit, is detailed in the next section. 

 <ins> **The</ins> <ins>research was applied to co\-create an online course and toolkit that has enhanced the understanding and capabilities of individuals and organisations engaged in climate change mitigation</ins> <ins>and sustainability initiatives**</ins> 

 The OU team combined their research \(SME growth processes, SME owner\-managers’ values and small business support organisations\), with specialist contributions from external partners \(The Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford and Europe’s leading climate communications consultancy, Climate Outreach\) in an ESRC\-funded initiative, ‘Growing Greener’ \(2017\-19\): http://business\-school.open.ac.uk/research/growing\-greener. They engaged with SME owner\-managers and business advisors to co\-create an innovative open access online course, ‘Promoting Sustainability in Business: A Values\-Based Toolkit’, which is hosted on the Open University’s ‘OpenLearn Create’ platform **\[C4\]**. 

 This initiative has expanded the capabilities of their partners, Climate Outreach in engaging with SMEs and business advisors. The Executive Director has commented: “ *The project has given Climate Outreach experience in working with audiences and sectors that present unique challenges for climate and sustainability communicators. Understanding how to build a values\-based engagement strategy with actors and intermediaries who are having to balance sustainability with other more instrumental priorities has provided Climate Outreach with invaluable learnings and experiences which have improved and strengthened the methodologies we use to conduct research and outreach”* **\[C6\]**. 

 Since its launch in February 2019, more than 900 people have engaged with the online course **\[C4\]** and monitoring evidence indicates that it has helped both individuals and organisations to engage their SME clients more effectively in relation to climate change mitigation and other important environmental issues **\[C5, C6, C7, C8, C9\]**. For example, a senior manager at international user experience \(UX\) design consultancy Akendi noted that: “ *This \[course and toolkit\] has accelerated our understanding of the problem space of SME engagement with sustainability and helped us form opinions about viable next steps in our project*” **\[C9b\]**. A programme manager at Bioregional, creators of the ‘One Planet Living’ framework, said: “ *We make considerable use values\-based engagement in our work with SMEs and start\-up ventures and recognise the importance of tailoring our approach so that it fits with the values and priorities of our clients. The online course and toolkit provide useful insights which help to inform our work with businesses”* **\[C9c\]**. The Business Relationship Manager at Low Carbon Hub, a leading social enterprise working to transform the energy system, also recognised the value of these resources: “ *It means that more advisors like me can learn about how a values\-based approach can help develop more meaningful, longer term relationships with SMEs, in turn helping to set more businesses on their way towards sustainability*” **\[C9d\]**. 

 **Blundel** and **Wahga** also influenced practitioners by piloting a training workshop, which combined the online course and face\-to\-face sessions, with 15 business advisors at WWF\-Pakistan and 20 graduate students \(primarily experienced professionals and nascent entrepreneurs\) at GCU, Lahore, one of the oldest and most prestigious seats of learning in Pakistan **\[C5\]**. WWF\-Pakistan has improved its routines and practices to support SMEs more effectively by making use of guidance from the course and specific insights from their research on environmental stewardship in leather and textile industry **\[O6\]**. For example, having attended the workshop, the organisation’s Regional Coordinator, Freshwater stated that: *“\[A\] major change in our practice has been that when working with firms we now identify those entrepreneurs having more active environmental values and network them with those who focus less on environmental improvement. We believe by doing so we have started to promote environmental improvement agenda in the Pakistani industries more effectively \[…\] we offer training to the staff of SMEs about Smart Environmental Management Practices, now through a more integrated approach using effective communication tools learnt during the \[workshop\]*” **\[C3b\]**. A GCU graduate student and hotel owner added: “ *\[I\]nformed by your work we have changed a number of practices at our hotel \[…\] We are doing our best to change the concept of traditional tourism to sustainable tourism by promoting environmental values amongst our guests and hotel owners. Moreover, I have led the making of a consortium of hotel owners who regularly meet and discuss possible measures to save water and reduce energy consumption*” **\[C3c\]**. 

 The values\-based approach to engagement, which is promoted through this course and toolkit, has informed policy\-making and practitioner audiences in various ways, including: inclusion in a policy briefing on ‘Eco\-Innovation in SMEs’, published by the European Commission’s Directorate\-General Environment in 2019 **\[C11**, pp. 30\-31; 45; 50 **\]**; a briefing for 15 business advisors \(energy\-related\) at the UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) **\[C7\]**; and a presentation at ‘Sustainable Built Environment 2019’, a conference attended by more than 200 built environment professionals, policy experts and government officials, which has also been made available as an open access publication **\[C12\]**. 

 <ins> **The research has enabled new learning experiences for undergraduate and postgraduate students at The Open University and in other institutions**</ins> 

 Their body of research on improving the environmental performance of SMEs **\[O1, O2, O5, O6\]** has been incorporated into the formal higher education curriculum, via case material, audio visual assets and learning activities, in the OU undergraduate modules, *B327 Creating Futures: “Sustainable Enterprise and Innovation* \(approximately 400 students since 2017\), and *B205 Exploring Innovation and Entrepreneurship*” \(more than 400 students since 2016\) **\[C10\]**. Related qualitative feedback from students on these courses includes: “ *I was really inspired by this module. The different projects undertaken throughout the module have motivated me to achieve sustainable enterprises at work and in personal life.*” \(B327, 2018 cohort\) **\[C10**, p.115 **\]**; “ *It is a full\-on, grown\-up course and not to be taken lightly. \[…\] It has also given me some useful tools which I have already used in my working life.*” \(B205, 2017 cohort\) **\[C10**, p.113 **\]**. 

 This research has also influenced the curriculum at GCU Lahore, including the decision to launch a new postgraduate course on environmental entrepreneurship in 2020, and key aspects of the curriculum, which incorporate outputs from this research **\[O6\]**. Since 2018, it has also encouraged MS \(MPhil level\) Entrepreneurship and SME Management students \(cohort of 15\-20 students per year, most of whom are also business owners and professional practitioners\) to examine environmental practices of SMEs in various industry sectors in Pakistan **\[C2\]**. The Programme Coordinator at GCU commented: “ *We have included your papers as readings in our courses \[and\] a number of entrepreneurship students have also received motivation to undertake research on green businesses in the country \[…\] one of our students is researching responsible tourism business in Northern areas of Pakistan, another one is focusing on environmentally sustainable practices in private and public sector hospitals, and yet one more is interested in the adoption of green technologies in early\-stage micro and small businesses*” **\[C2\]**. 

 Work on these projects has been further developed during 2020, in spite of constraints imposed by the Covid\-19 epidemic, with future impact planned through engagement with policymakers and intermediaries in Pakistan’s textiles sector.

Using the Schwartz Value System (SVS) as a framework for a qualitative analysis, we identify four “ideal-types” of SME managers and provide rich descriptions of the ways in which values shape their constructions of environmental engagement. In contrast to previous research, which is framed around a binary divide between self-enhancing and self-transcending values, our typology distinguishes between individuals drawing primarily on Power or on Achievement values and indicates how a combination of Achievement and Benevolence values is particularly significant in shaping environmental engagement.

on an in‐depth, qualitative study into the pro‐environmental engagement of small businesses in the east of England, with respect to climate change in particular. Managers of environmentally pro‐active small businesses were asked about the pro‐environmental measures they had implemented in their firms, their motivations for doing so, and their understanding of climate change. The managers in this study had a relatively good understanding of environmental issues in general and climate change in particular, and had implemented a range of pro‐environmental measures in their firms. Their understanding of climate change was a holistic one, which sat within their overall understanding of environmental and social issues. While economic arguments and external pressure played a role in their pro‐environmental engagement, perhaps the most notable motivation for managers in this study to engage with environmental and climate change issues was personal values and beliefs. Environmentally engaged managers exhibited an internal locus of control. Some of these findings contrast with the views of key informants in local government and business advice organisations, who tend to emphasise the business case and cost arguments when trying to encourage small businesses towards greater environmental engagement. These findings suggest that public policy and business advice in this area should perhaps focus more strongly on personal values and a sense of being able to contribute to environmental protection in their engagement with small businesses.

A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies and financial opportunities that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient or better managed: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted at Strathclyde has demonstrated that young people born in Central and Eastern Europe who have settled in the UK are disadvantaged in terms of rights and opportunities, including their education outcomes, well\-being and access to services. This research, which involved work with over 1,500 EU\-born young people, informed a unique programme of training, policy and community activities. It has led to significant improvements in policy and practice supporting migrant groups. Events and training materials for practitioners enhanced their understanding of young people’s experiences and barriers to full participation in society, including experiences of discrimination and loss of rights post\-Brexit. Research was used to tackle gaps in service provision and improve public understanding of EU migration across the UK and internationally through blogs, media contributions, campaigns and art exhibitions. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Migration ranks as one of the most important factors of global change and was a defining issue in the UK 2016 Brexit Referendum. After the expansion of the European Union in 2004 and 2007, Britain experienced a significant increase in net migration from the EU states, with over 3,600,000 EU nationals now living in the UK. Since 2008, Sime has led extensive research on migration and migrants’ lives, examining the ways in which structural inequalities and everyday experiences of marginalisation impact young people who have migrated to Britain from Central and Eastern Europe with their families. Across several studies, this research showed that migrant children and young people continue to be disadvantaged by education, immigration and welfare policies across the UK, and highlighted the need for alternative approaches to ensure their needs are met and their rights respected, especially as they have become more vulnerable in the context of Brexit and changes to EU migrants’ rights to live and work in the UK. 

###  Impact of migration on newly arrived Eastern European children in the UK 

 An ESRC\-funded study \(2008\-2010\) investigated the impact of migration on newly arrived Central and Eastern European \(CEE\) children and young people in the UK. Drawing on focus groups with 57 EU\-born young people aged 12\-18 and 23 family case studies, the project found that young people’s relationships with family and friends were significantly challenged by migration, leading to consequences for young people’s agency and well\-being and a sense of transnational rather than local belonging and ontological insecurity \[ **R3**\]. It also demonstrated that young people’s access to services \(education, health, leisure\) \[ **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\] was constrained by their perceptions of entitlement to access, previous experiences of service use and providers’ attitudes. As a result, transnational service use continued for many long after settlement. This study was followed by a knowledge exchange programme \(2012\-13\), also funded by the ESRC, which built on the research to inform policy and practice across a range of services through events. 

###  Roma migrant families’ engagement with education and other services 

 A separate British Academy\-funded study \(2012\-2013\) specifically investigated Roma migrant families’ engagement with education and other services in Glasgow \[ **R4**\]. It analysed data on >400 children’s attainment and used interviews with Roma parents to identify barriers they encountered in engaging with education and other services. The study highlighted the extremely low attainment of Roma children, often linked to experiences of segregation in their birth countries, and significant barriers in accessing key public services. Roma parents’ ability to engage in their children’s education was impacted by their own stigmatising experiences of education. The study recommended a family\-based approach to tackling educational disadvantage, improvements in outreach to make services accessible for families, and mentoring and support for children during key transition points \(i.e. early years to primary, primary to secondary\). 

###  Identity, citizenship and belonging among EU\-born migrant youth 

 An ESRC\-funded study \(2016\-2019\) examined issues of identity, citizenship and belonging among CEE migrant young people aged 12\-18, in the context of Brexit. This is the only UK\-wide project of its scale focusing on young migrants, collecting data with over 1,200 young people aged 12\-18 after the 2016 EU Referendum, and documenting at a crucial time their feelings of belonging and identity, everyday experiences of discrimination and views on the likely impact of Brexit on their lives. In the study survey, 77% of respondents said they experienced racism and xenophobia, with a significant increase after the Referendum \[ **R5**\]. Focus groups with 122 young people and 20 family case studies explored in more depth issues of family relationships, future aspirations and the impact of Brexit on family decisions to remain in Britain long\-term. While young people reported a strong sense of belonging to Britain, Brexit has made them reconsider their long\-term plans \[ **R6**\]. Currently, young EU migrants face ongoing barriers and a precarious future in relation to their rights in the UK post\-Brexit \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. With only 8% of respondents having secured British citizenship, the research revealed the significant risk that young EU nationals may become undocumented and socially excluded. It concluded that, given increasing experiences of discrimination and stigma faced by this group, the UK and devolved Governments must take active measures to ensure the rights of EU nationals are not affected by changes to immigration rules and welfare policies and the introduction of the ‘settled status’ scheme. It highlighted the likely risk of a new generation of undocumented migrants emerging, given the timeline for ‘settled status’ applications, with potential consequences echoing the Windrush generation.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Through a sustained programme of briefing key stakeholders, training activities and community outreach, Strathclyde’s programme of research exploring social justice issues faced by Central and Eastern European migrant youth has: 

-  **Informed policy debates and shaped national and local government policy** relating to European migration and rights by providing research evidence through various channels; 

-  **Enhanced practitioner training across key public services** \(education, social work, policing\) and **created research\-informed resources** to teach diversity issues and tackle prejudice\-based bullying in schools; 

-  **Improved public understanding of migration and raised awareness of EU migrants’ rights** through public exhibitions, events and social media campaigns. 

###  4.1 Informed policy debates and shaped national and local government policy 

 The findings on CEE migrants’ use of public services, which highlighted barriers to access and regular transnational health service use \[ **R1**, **R2**\], informed a national evidence review on the impacts of migration in Scotland carried out by the Scottish Government \[ **S1a** pp.42, 46, 66\], leading to new policy aiming to retain migrants in Scotland and making the case for further devolved powers on immigration. The findings on the reported increase in incidents of xeno\-racism experienced by EU\-born young people, their changing plans for the future and the impact of Brexit on their rights to stay \[ **R5, R6**\] have also resulted in evidence\-based policy. A report from the Expert Advisory Group on Migration and Population \[ **S1b** pp.17, 31\] was informed by Strathclyde’s findings on young EU nationals’ plans for long\-term settlement \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. The same findings were cited in the Scottish Affairs Committee’s ‘Immigration and Scotland’ inquiry in 2017 \[ **S2a** Q35\], on young migrants’ experiences of racism and xenophobia and long\-term settlement plans. Prof Sime gave oral evidence to the Scottish Parliament’s Equalities and Human Rights Committee inquiry \[ **S2b** pp.21\-24, 30\-40\] on ‘Bullying and harassment of children and young people in schools’, which aimed to improve the monitoring and tackling of bullying incidents in Scotland’s schools. 

 Strathclyde’s research has highlighted the precarious status of European migrants post\-Brexit. The Office of Scotland’s Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development used the findings to raise the issue of EU migrants’ post\-Brexit legal status in Parliament, especially in relation to the need for families to access information on ‘settled status’ and citizenship routes. To ensure consideration of this within broader UK policy debates, Prof. Sime briefed MPs who made interventions in the UK Parliament on the rights of EU nationals and was invited to give evidence to the All\-Party Parliamentary Committee on ‘Better Brexit for Young People’ chaired by Stephen Kinnock \(in March 2018\) \[ **S2c**\]. The key dimension of this work focussed on tackling the increase in xeno\-racism and securing the rights of EU\-born young people post\-Brexit. The research findings have also been disseminated through workshops and social media campaigns \[ **S4**, **S6**, **S9** and @MigrantYouth\] to ensure that organisations supporting families have access to information on ‘settled status’, so that more EU families secure their status before the June 2021 deadline. 

 Drawing on research with Roma migrants in Glasgow \[ **R4**\], where most of Scotland’s Roma migrant population lives, in November 2016, Sime contributed to an audit of the UK Cabinet Office’s Race Disparity Unit \(RDU\) \[ **S2d**\], created by the UK Government to document inequalities across ethnic groups and improve data monitoring. At the session, involving also the Race Equality Policy Lead for the Scottish Government, Sime highlighted the under\-counting of Roma migrants \(often miscounted as ‘White\-Other’, based on the majority ethnicity in country of birth and/or reluctance to self\-identify for fear of stigma\) and provided evidence on the very low attainment and high dropout rates of Roma children. The RDU published a report in 2017, recognising there was less data for Roma groups, especially new migrants, and said evidence to the audit helped *‘identify those public services where disparities are diminishing and those where work is needed to develop effective strategies to reduce disparities between ethnic groups’* \[ **S2e**, para. 1.16 & 2.10\] *.* The RDU has committed to improve the evidence base for these groups in its Quality Improvement Plan and now monitors more closely outcomes such as education and health. In Scotland, as a result of the research, Glasgow City Council has improved approaches to enhance the achievement of Roma children, including targeted adult literacy classes, mentoring and supporting Roma families to fully engage with services \[ **S3**\]. According to the Support Services Manager, *‘the Strathclyde research has not only helped support the work we undertake in schools, it has also had an impact on how we manage policy, resource allocation and collect and use information centrally’* \[ **S3**\]. It also informed anti\-poverty initiatives to support families applying for clothing grants, free school meals and welfare/rights support \[ **S3**\]. This has particular importance as Roma groups remain more vulnerable to poverty, racism, exploitation and the risk of not securing their ‘settled status’ post\-Brexit. 

 **4.2 Enhanced practitioner training across key services through research\-informed resources to teach diversity issues and tackle prejudice\-based bullying in schools** 

 As migration to the UK has increased since 2004, there was a demand for research\-based training for practitioners working with migrants. Sime’s research informed an extensive training programme for practitioners delivering key services \(education, social work, police, voluntary sector\). Since 2010, more than 5,000 teachers, social workers, students, community work practitioners, police staff and others have benefitted from regular bespoke training events based on materials created by Sime and her team. The training materials have included policy and practice briefings \(over 6,000 downloads\) \[ **S4a**\], a Toolkit for service providers working with migrant children and their families, a guide on ‘How to talk about Brexit with your family’, videos and podcasts. The research \[ **R1**\- **R3**, **R5**, **R6**\] has impacted practice through joint activities with Education Scotland, 40\+ local authorities across the UK and other stakeholders, such as Social Work departments. Other examples of organisations attending included Glasgow City Council, Creative Scotland, Multi\-Cultural Family Base \(MCFB\), Glasgow Roma and Asylum Social Work Team, Glasgow Centre for Population Health, Romanian and Polish Embassies, Save the Children, Barnardo’s, Families Outside, The Scottish Government, Home Office and many more. Overwhelmingly positive, the feedback from events organised described the sessions as *‘excellent and worthwhile’* and *‘much needed’*. Many experienced practitioners reported improved understanding of the needs of migrant groups and better skills in engaging with families, some saying: *‘the seminar has widened my scope of understanding beyond my own service’* or *‘I heard excellent examples of good practice which we are going to implement in my service’* \[ **S8**\]. Many went on to share learning with their practice teams and the research team provided follow up support on numerous occasions through visits to services. Accordingly, there was a significant expansion in practitioners’ confidence in supporting children’s learning and their integration and in offering families support, through inclusive education provision, social work and health practice \[ **S3**, **S8**\]. 

 The overall impact of the research findings into the prevalence of racism and xenophobia linked to EU groups and the risk to migrant young people’s status and rights post\-Brexit has also led to practice\-based activities, helping the wider government and local authorities’ efforts to promote the inclusion of EU nationals post\-Brexit. Sime worked with Scotland’s anti\-bullying service, Respect *me*, to produce a teachers’ pack which was sent to over 2,000 schools and was downloaded more than 1,500 times, to tackle prejudice\-based bullying and improve practice across services \[ **S4b**, **S5**\]. Fully funded by the Scottish Government, Respect *me* led a ‘Choose Respect’ campaign in 2018/19, targeting all schools in Scotland and media channels. The teachers’ pack was also promoted by Education Scotland to all schools across the 32 local authorities through the National Improvement Hub \[ **S7**\], the executive agency of the Scottish Government which ensures the quality of the education system. This has led to thousands of pupils in primary and secondary schools learning about prejudice\-based bullying and empathy and schools adopting better systems of reporting \[ **S5**\]. Sime also used the materials to train 1,200\+ student teachers and social workers at Strathclyde, trained officers of Police Scotland and briefed the Crown Prosecution Service’s National Scrutiny Panel on migrants’ experiences of hate crime. The evidence from the research was also presented in two Royal Society of Edinburgh reports \[ **S6**\]. Both documents were distributed to practitioners, policy makers and service managers at impact events, where Sime advocated for the inclusion of migrants in education post\-Brexit and their citizenship rights \[ **S6a**\] and better access to health services \[ **S6b**\], given evidence from Sime’s research \[ **R1**\] that migrants, including children, are low users of healthcare provision. 

###  4.3 Improved public understanding and attitudes to migration 

 At a time of increased public debate on migration and in the context of Brexit, research led by Sime informed a wide range of public activities aimed at engaging members of the public. Art exhibitions, online blogs and social media campaigns have been used to engage with the general public around migrants’ experiences and attitudes to migration \[ **S9**\]. Two art\-based exhibitions \- the ‘Children’s exhibition on migration’ \(Scotland Street School Museum\) and ‘Here to Stay?’ \(Tramway\) \- were co\-produced with young people and attracted over 7,000 visitors in total \(count from museum directors\), including school children from migrant and non\-migrant backgrounds, their families, service representatives and the general public. The feedback highlighted the positive impact the exhibitions had on public understandings of migration and migratory experiences. Comments after the event included: *‘This exhibition has made me change my views on migrants, I now understand why they leave their countries’* and *‘This is a provocative and complex exhibition about home and identity \- very relatable and an eye opener’*. Many people who attended said they felt challenged on their views on migration and better informed \[ **S8**\]. 

 In addition, Strathclyde’s guide on ‘How to talk about Brexit with your family’, based on work with Youth Advisors, was disseminated to hundreds of schools and online across the UK in 2016\-2019, supported by talks that Sime and the team gave to young people at assemblies/during lessons and at parents’ evenings. These events informed young people on their rights and the need to apply for ‘settled status’ or citizenship and how to report incidents of racism and hate crime. Social media campaigns informed by the research were organised through Twitter @MigrantYouth \(\#heretostay \#migrantyouth \#migrantsrights\), Instagram and Facebook. Activities also took place with migrant families in community centres, churches, museums, shopping centres, reaching thousands \(examples include Exeter Respect Festival, Explorathon, North Devon Diversity Festival, ESRC Festival of Social Science, AHRC Being Human festival\). Significant media coverage has also been achieved through a range of outlets including *Channel 4 News, BBC World Service, Herald Scotland, The Guardian, Huffington Post, LSE Brexit Blog* \(Overall monthly readership: 790,000\) and *The Conversation* \(Overall monthly readership: 2,300,000\). In terms of reach, the Channel 4 News story was viewed more than 50,000 times; BBC World Service Newshour, which interviewed Sime in August 2019, has over 319 million listeners a week; and thousands more were reached through international media \[ **S9**\]. Sime’s research has also strengthened advocacy campaigns for the rights of EU citizens, such as The 3 Million and Migrant Voice. Since 2020, Sime has utilised her position as Vice Convenor of a new non\-partisan network, EU & Me \( [www.euandme.com](http://www.euandme.com/)\), to inform work and engage the general public in constructive debate over Britain’s relationship with Europe post\-Brexit.

In this paper, we examine the experiences of young people born in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) who are part of the 1.5 migrant generation living in “Brexit Britain.” We focus on two key themes: (a) young people\'s feelings of belonging to Britain, their countries of birth and Europe, and the ways in which these have been impacted by the EU Referendum result; (b) young people\'s future plans, in an intergenerational context, with particular regard to their feelings of belonging and the ruptures of migration and Brexit. Britain\'s decision to leave the EU caused uncertainty for CEE 1.5 generation young people at a time when many of them were consciously reflecting on their beings, becomings, and belongings. The majority of young people asserted a sense of belonging to Britain whilst simultaneously feeling a sense of “in‐between‐ness.” Many young people wanted to remain living in Britain, at least in the short term, and felt a sense of belonging to Britain. Our focus on the potential intergenerational impact of Brexit suggests that CEE young people and parents may view possibilities for the future differently; we examine some of the key reasons for these differences from the young people\'s perspectives."", \'original\': None}', 'Authors': ""[{'first_name': 'Naomi', 'last_name': 'Tyrrell', 'initials': None, 'researcher_id': 'ur.014007604241.61',

to a new country is marked by excitement, anxiety and practical challenges in managing this significant transition. This paper draws upon the concepts of social capital and social networks to examine migrant children\'s access to services post‐migration. Using data from a qualitative study with E astern E uropean families in S cotland, we identify a range of cumulative barriers that limit children\'s access to services and illustrate how their experiences are shaped by ethnicity, social class and place. The study shows that migrant children are often disadvantaged post‐migration and develop their own mechanisms to mitigate the impact of migration on their lives. We argue that migrant children\'s own social networks are relevant and they need to be analysed through a more individualised approach.

<p>Research has shown that young people born in Central and Eastern Europe who have settled in the UK are disadvantaged in rights and opportunities, particularly in access to education and support services. Working with over 1,500 of these young people, this research developed a programme of training, policy, and community activities. Events and training materials highlighted youths' understanding of their experiences and barriers to participation in society, foregrounding discrimination and loss of rights after Brexit. This training has been accessed by over 5,000 individuals working in key services (education, social work, police, voluntary sector). The research informed social media campaigns, such as @MigrantYouth on Twitter (#heretostay #migrantyouth #migrantsrights), Instagram and Facebook. There has also been significant news coverage, such as the LSE Brexit Blog (overall monthly readership of 790,000) and Channel 4 News, where the story was viewed more than 50,000 times.

<h6>Countering the ‘Hostile Environment’ through Creative Practice: Making Space for the Stories of Immigration Detainees</h6>
<p>David Herd’s Refugee Tales, a project culminating in a three-volume collection of first-hand accounts of refugee experience, has been instrumental in changing public perception of refugee experience. Refugee Tales has informed changes to local and national policies to support these vulnerable communities, and has been used as a lobbying tool to press for legal change. For example, Refugee Tales included accounts of indefinite detention that influenced the framing of new detention policy. 28for28.org, which filmed readings of the published tales released on social media across 28 days, had such reach that extracts from Refugee Tales I and II was used as evidence in the Joint Committee on Human Rights’ Report on Immigration Detention. The Refugee Tales are taught in over 50 universities across the world, including Oxford, Cambridge, Cornell, Leiden, and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The Oak National Academy, which was funded by the Department of Education and was the main provider of home-school education during lockdown, dedicated a series of online lessons for KS3 students to the Refugee Tales books, with a reach of 4.7 million visitors to the online site.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 UoH research supported prisoner reintegration through the use of new interventions in prison education, emphasizing the potential of *hope* as a corrective pedagogical tool. Former prisoners and current prisoners, policy advisors, prison staff, related professional practitioners and members of the public had their social and political horizons broadened by reconsidering the role of \(prison\) education in the processes of reintegration. The researchers engaged 64 participants – both in and out of prison – in study groups across 60 weeks to encourage debate about US prison narratives \(memoir, film, poetry\). The discussions then underpinned creative and reflective writing activities. The outputs have been exhibited in publications and at events that have attracted 100s of participants in the Humber region, encouraged social inclusivity and supported \(ex\) prisoners’ learning. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The research programme is inherently interdisciplinary – drawing on American Studies, Critical Prison Studies, Criminology, and Creative Writing – and was inspired by fieldwork undertaken by Metcalf for her 2012 monograph \(R6\) about gang memoirs. Since then the UoH has produced significant research exploring prison narratives, desistance \(stopping reoffending\), and ultimately creative writings. The research was supported by Arts Council England \(£12,255\) and Hull City Council Arts grants \(£1,350\) awarded in 2018; a Ferens Education Trust grant \(£1,000\) awarded in 2015; and a British Academy Small Grant \(£5,070.39\) awarded in 2013. The three key research themes / insights are as follows: 

 **a\) That US \(prison\) culture fascinates participants as a discussion topic.** 

 The impetus of this work partly came from Metcalf’s research \(R4\) that studied memoirs of Shaun Attwood. The significance of Attwood’s books arguably lies in their ""Americanness""; as an Englishman entangled in the ""exceptional"" US system his narrative provides a crucial \(transatlantic\) perspective. Such cross\-cultural reflections reveal a fascination with US prison culture. For example, the depiction of prison and life *post\-*prison in *The Shawshank Redemption* constituted an accessible and useful way to enter into critical reflection and writing \(R1\). Cultural awareness arguably serves as a foundation of communication, and consequently transformation \(R3, R4\). Calverley \(R3, R5\) has similarly investigated the ways in which cultural engagement may impact prisoner behaviour post\-release. 

 **b\) That we should attend to the views of \(ex\) prisoners as cultural consumers.** 

 Metcalf has previously conducted interviews with US memoirists \(both in and out of prison\) and extensive audience research with a variety of readers who consume such books \(R6\). This revealed that while for some an incarcerated author was somehow “exciting”, many readers were ostensibly more interested in the narrative arc where ex\-offenders were reintegrated back into society \(i.e. that redemption was possible\). The research found that to understand texts that deal with “real\-world” issues, we should ask “real\-world” readers what they do with them. This corroborates Calverley’s findings that we should attend to the views and experiences of ex\-prisoners \(R5\) in formulating desistance supportive social context and policy. Furthermore, the research \(R1, R2, R5\) verifies that this specific form of co\-creative production, sparked and stimulated by apposite texts, has the potential to support reintegration. 

 **c\) That prisoners’ engagement with hopeful narratives can help make sense of their lives.** 

 Narrative Criminology considers how offenders engage with narrative to “make sense of their lives”. This research argues that in the case of Attwood and others like him, we should consider not just what they say about violence but how they say it \(R1, R2, R4\); this can hold particular meaning for ex\-prisoners who are working hard to desist from crime. The act of writing can be particularly meaningful in the desistance process, especially when combined with hope as both Calverley and Metcalf have noted \(R5, R2\) and as underpinned over half of the study groups. The co\-produced output, *Hope Walks By Me; Justice and Liberty in the Lands of the Free – Poetry & Prose by Ex\-Offenders* \(R1\), was incorporated as a teaching tool into the next phase of the project.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact has several dimensions: a\) individual learning transformations of \(ex\) prisoners to support their reintegration \(both emotionally and practically\); b\) innovations in \(ex\) prisoners’ education and increased productivity for professional practitioners in the field; and, c\) improved public understanding of the challenges facing \(ex\) prisoners when released. The evidence collection is case\-based and qualitative analysis, as well as creative and participatory. 

 **a\) Individual Learning Transformations to Support Reintegration into Society** 

 Researcher Metcalf partnered with ex\-prisoner resettlement organisations in Hull between 2015 and 2019 where she offered “courses” for service users alongside a former writer\-in\-residence for HMPPS. In the fall of 2020, another module was run at HMP Hull though by distance as part of the Learning Together \(LT\) national network. Originating at the University of Cambridge, LT is a prison education initiative which unites university and prison learners. It provided in\-cell education documents \(“Thinklets”\) for prisoners across the UK during the first Covid lockdown in 2020 \(R13\). At the in\-person meetings and also remotely, participants studied a different US prison text \(e.g. poems from Guantanamo Bay *, The Shawshank Redemption,* memoirs by Shaun Attwood and former street gang members, or Martin Luther King’s Letter from  Birmingham Jail\) to discuss issues such as race / class / gender / immigration / citizenship / human rights / economy, both in the US and UK. UoH research informed the fieldwork practices \(i.e. the choice of text for study – R2, R4, R6\) and the tutors then used these critical discussions to spark creative and reflective writings. 

 The emotional confidence of participants was significantly enhanced, especially through becoming published authors. One of the ex\-prisoners’ key\-workers stated that the groups and being published in *Hope Walks By Me; Justice and Liberty in the Lands of the Free – Poetry & Prose by Ex\-Offenders* \(2019\) gave the participant “ *such a boost to his confidence, outlook, and general attitude that I had not seen in the three years that I had known him*” \(E5\). Changing opinion about oneself was regularly flagged in the poems, revealing a “new” sense of identity and self\-worth in contemporary society: “ *Stay confident, see things through / Do the best things for you*” \(R1\). Participants \(mostly unemployed and seeking work\) were equipped with beneficial and eye\-catching experiences / skills that could be put into a CV or job application \(E4, E8, E11\). 

 Several of the chosen texts for study deliberately addressed questions around re\-offending and desistance from crime drawing on Calverley’s research \(R3, R5\) and the struggles that Attwood faced \(R4\). Not all desistance research revolves around longitudinal sociological studies \(i.e. tracking prisoner behaviour long after release\); the study and ensuing writings encouraged participants to think about desistance and its counterpart, re\-offending. Evidence suggests that for some this “real\-world” research initiated a reflection on their goals, and encouraged them to rethink who they wanted to be. As one participant wrote, “ *Keep strong, be a fighter / One day you / Could be a creative writer*” \(R1\). Learners at HMP Hull also articulated how the study helped them confront and resist temptations to re\-offend. As another noted, “ *the Shaun Attwood session seemed to hit a nerve with me, because, I'm currently in the same kind of situation Shaun was in, and eventually \[he had\] the outcome of desistance. It really gives me the hope that I can accomplish those things*” \(E3, 11\). 

 While encouraging the group discussions about reflecting on one’s own identity, and coming to terms with a change in lifestyle, the tutors guided participants to explicitly consider the ways in which, as Calverley’s research highlights, hope has a key role to play in daily life both in and out of prison \(R5\). This was then seen in feedback on the sessions: “ *I'm finding that in some way or another, the word hope can be used in every session I've taken, it's a very powerful thing is hope and broken down, the word can be interpreted in many ways*” \(E3\). Meanwhile, the poems suggested that hope became a useful way for participants to humanise themselves and hence a leveller of sorts with others in the community upon release: “ *Hope is what makes us human*” and though “ *Hope is different for me than it is for you*” “\[It\] *is something that we all own from birth right through to heaven*” \(R1\). 

 **b\) Innovations in Prison Learning & Increased Productivity for Practitioners** 

 Money from the sales of *Hope Walks by Me* was ploughed back into Litten’s fees to run similarly\-structured sessions by himself. This happened at two further centres for “at\-risk” populations in Hull in late 2019 and early 2020 where the majority of service users are ex\-prisoners \(E1, E5\). These two centres had attended a community morning run by Litten and Metcalf in October 2019 where their lesson plans and content had been showcased, as well as the resultant publication. The book generated interest in such a fashion that it was hailed a “book of the year” by noted writer and critic Bonnie Greer in 2019 in *The Financial Times* who described the writings as “powerful” and “true” \(E13\). Joe Hakim, presenter of the prime time “Culture Night” show on BBC Humberside called the book an “amazing project” and invited Litten, Metcalf and the Director of Barbican Press \(the publisher of *Hope Walks*\) to record an extended segment for his show discussing the role of art in the reintegration process of ex\-prisoners \(E2\). 

 *Hope Walks by Me* \(R1\) was thereafter used to underpin a Thinklet document on *The Shawshank Redemption* in April 2020 \(R13\) which helped transform prison education nationally during the Covid pandemic. Three further Thinklets were then produced, informed by Metcalf and Calverley’s research \(R2\-R5\) to use US prison culture as prompts to explore key \(“life skill”\) themes of Hope, Desistance, Persuasiveness and Humanity on  a LT module run in the fall of 2020. This LT module, with learners from both UoH and HMP Hull, was the first of its kind in the UK to encourage connectivity through written correspondence; university learners peer reviewed the prison learners’ assessment portfolios \(which included both critical and creative materials\) and vice versa. The creative component of this module, was a distinctive new development of a LT network that was already established by Calverley in Hull in 2018. Many of the prisoner learners on this course were nearing their release date. 

 The Directors of the national LT network note that “ *Through this work Jo has made an outstanding contribution to Learning Together’s aim to be at the forefront of developing and implementing innovation and excellence in a higher education which explicitly includes people who are under criminal justice supervision*” \(E10\). The Directors have already shared learning from Metcalf’s pilot at Hull across the LT Network and with HMPPS which has reached “ *hundreds of colleagues working in relevant areas of policy and practice in HMPPS*, *the Ministry of Justice, national and international universities and beyond*” \(E10\). They reported on Metcalf’s work to the Policy Lead for Prison Education at the Ministry of Justice who contacted Metcalf thereafter to find out more about her pedagogical ambitions and experiences. LT are currently using Metcalf’s course as an example for other partnerships, not merely as they adapt to current circumstances as a result of Covid\-19, but also as they advance their collective strategy for extending digital innovation across the Network \(E10\). 

 Metcalf’s four Thinklets have also been identified as useful pedagogical tools by other practitioners working with \(ex\-\) prisoners, as they encourage their clients to think about their reintegration. The Community Rehabilitation Company \(CRC\) have made the four Thinklets available as to probation officers to use in 1\-on\-1 situations across Humberside, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. Indeed, court orders issue “Rehabilitation Requirement Days” and as part of that ex\-offenders have to do “meaningful activity”. An Education, Training and Employment regional lead for the CRC deemed them “ *an interesting and creative way of exploring themes that may relate to our service user’s offending behaviour”, adding, “I was keen to find a way to include them in our ETE package*” \(E8\). The Thinklets are also distributed at Humbercare \(one of the resettlement organisations that originally partnered with Metcalf\), where one of the Managers, is “ *regularly seeking ways to engage our service users in productive and engaging activities, which has been a challenge in lockdown*” \(E4\). Wagner took part in the *Shawshank* event and believes that the significance of *Hope Walks* lies not merely with individual contributors, but in the way it serves as strong evidence to the Humbercare Commissioners that the facility could improve service users’ lives through such groups \(E4\). 

 Working with Metcalf and Calverley has changed Litten’s choice of subject matter for his tutoring work in creative writing. He continues to teach at various HMPs in the North\-East and across Yorkshire, YOIs and also “First Story” \(with marginalised young people\) using similar texts as inspiration and thus mainstreaming the approach originally suggested by Metcalf: “ *Using American history and culture as a prism through which to view the concepts of justice and freedom was a master\-stroke*” \(E1\). Throughout his work, Litten now incorporates concepts of hope throughout all such work more explicitly than he had ever done prior: “ *I now see hope itself as a learning outcome in much of my tutoring work, rather than merely as a philosophical discussion point*” \(E1\). The research also shaped the vision of the Director of Barbican Press \(publisher of *Hope Walks*\): “ *In publishing terms, what was new for me was allowing a rawness to come through, and political statements and sentiments that to me were abrasive but I knew not to censor, because I saw that these views came from a rawness of life that was genuine and not usually explored in published works*” \(E2\). 

 **c\) Change of Attitudes towards \(Ex\) Prisoners & their Reintegration** 

 Attwood delivered talks to participants at two of the ex\-prisoner resettlement projects where Metcalf worked \(R&R, Humbercare\), and was a guest speaker at a 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary screening of *Shawshank* at the UoH \(May 2019\). Before the film Metcalf delivered a talk, followed by Attwood, and then chaired a Q&A panel consisting of a Wagner, Attwood, Litten, and two group participants \(ex\-prisoners\). This was followed two months later by a book launch of the creative writings produced by the groups \(July 2019\), featuring a panel discussion with Calverley and Metcalf, Litten, a service user and two Humbercare community practitioners. Approximately 200 members of the public attended the events in total, with evaluative questionnaires pointing towards a real appetite for believing in the possibility of change, rather than just people attending out of curiosity \(E6\). 

 At the May 2019 event, Wagner spoke of the challenges Humbercare have faced in housing ex\-prisoners in the local community \(E4\). Early in the focus groups, it became apparent that some participants were struggling with negative attitudes from members of the public in a variety of ways \(e.g. stereotyping at job interviews, in housing applications, from family members etc\). The events, as well as *Hope Walks*, aimed to raise awareness among individuals in the community / society more widely of the difficulties facing prisoners upon release. The audiences at the events included students \(though no one under 18\) and local citizens from a range of ages and backgrounds. If social inclusion is key to reintegration, the two events sought to challenge stereotyping, create more empathy, and remind the public that prisoners have a right to reintegrate. Quantitative and qualitative feedback from the events suggests that this was certainly achieved on some level. For example, at the Shawshank event, 96.1% of the respondents \(strongly\) agreed that their understanding of \(ex\-\) prisoners and their social problems had been increased, while at the book launch with 18 respondents this figure was 87.5% \(E6\). 

 An attendee at both the *Shawshank* talk and the book launch, was inspired to apply for – and secure – a weekend job in the library at HMP Hull and volunteer work with ex\-offenders at Humbercare \(E7\), stressing that both events served to challenge her preconceptions of \(ex\-\) prisoners \(E7\). Horrex, as well as staff from HMP Hull, have spoken about the importance of Metcalf’s work in disseminating such views with a range of age groups including young people \(E7, E11\). An adapted version of the LT module has been rolled out by Metcalf at the sixth form where Horrex works, as well as two others \(a public college in Lincolnshire and a private school in Newcastle\). This provides “Extended Opportunities” for 17 and 18 year\-olds seeking enrichment opportunities for UCAS applications, while simultaneously these Thinklets, as the head of training at Horrex’s institution explains, provide “ *an opportunity that is urgently required within sixth form establishments due to the complexities surrounding prisoners both inside prison and once released”* \(E7\). 

 Such changes in attitude were also evident among university students who undertook the LT module at HMP Hull \(E3\). The Directors of the national LT network assert that Metcalf’s “ *clever mix of creative and critical exercises in the course as a whole gave prison\-based learners ways to think about how they may support themselves upon release, <ins>and</ins> university learners the opportunity to think about the responsibility we all have to support reintegration after prison*” \(E10\). For example, while one university learner commented in their assessment portfolio that, “ *I now realise we need to work to de\-stigmatise ex\-convicts and reintegrate them back into society \- I wholeheartedly believe that change and reform are possible*” \(E3\). The specific choice of texts studied, and exercises deployed on the module, enabled this. Having been required to write a letter to Boris Johnson to persuade him to put more funding into prison education, another university learner noted “ *The letter made me change the way I view prisoners, I have more empathy now*” \(E3, E9\). In their letter to the Prime Minister, one of the students even went so far as to suggest a new association called LILAC – *Living Inspirational Lives after Conviction* whose aim is to “ *offer real world education and training packages that take into account people’s current psychological well\-being, their educational attainment and their hopes and dreams*” \(E9\).

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Professor Franklin’s research on internet\-policymaking processes has informed her leadership of the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition \(IRPC\). Since 2014 Franklin’s work has influenced policymakers, digital rights campaigners, and technology experts during a period in which human rights became recognized as integral to internet design, terms of access, and use. A core element in her impact work has been her role in disseminating the IRPC *Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet* through the “Charter Booklet Project”. Her scholarship and advocacy work have contributed to changing mindsets across the internet policymaking spectrum: where once human rights standards were considered external to the internet’s design, these legal standards and norms now prevail for governments, private sector, and civil society representatives. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Franklin’s research has challenged popular perceptions of the internet as purely a technical, engineering achievement, led by the private sector with little government intervention. Franklin’s findings are based on long\-term, close\-up study of key participants, processes, debates, drafting processes and outcomes of internet\-policy consultations. Her work has been embedded in and, thereby, contributes to the cross\-sector participation characterizing internet policymaking, evidenced by her access to strategic planning, drafting processes, and agenda\-setting consultations. This depth of access provides Franklin with granular knowledge of policymaking processes from within emerging *global internet governance* institutions. She was present and on record \- as researcher and leader in human rights advocacy for the online environment \- in meetings culminating in the UN General Assembly, and Council of Europe each recognizing in 2014 that human rights also exist online and must be respected under international law. 

 In *Digital Dilemmas*, \(2013\), and related publications \(2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020\) Franklin provides \(1\) the empirical evidence of how powerbrokers \(e.g. Google, Facebook, the US State Department, European Union, UN agencies such as UNESCO and the International Telecommunications Union\) compete over the internet’s “narrative of origins”, and \(2\) reveals the stakes, and shifting “terms of engagement” for actors making increasingly publicized decisions about internet futures; e.g. its transmission architecture, technical standards \(Franklin 2013, 2015\) in view of \(3\) the implications of digital, networked systems of surveillance and data\-tracking on human rights law and norms \(2018, 2019\). Franklin’s research undergirds greater awareness in UN, regional, and national domains of how human rights standards \- as fundamental design principle and legal obligation \- remain an ongoing project: a source of conflict and collaboration between internet businesses, regulators, and civil society \(2015, 2020\). 

 Since being invited to stand for election as Co\-Chair of the *Internet Rights and Principles Dynamic Coalition* \(IRPC\) at the UN Internet Governance Forum \(IGF\) \- serving in 2013\-2015, and 2016\-2018, and subsequently re\-elected onto the current Steering Committee \- Franklin has been able to observe the timeline of the *Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet* from the outset \(Franklin 2013, 2015, 2016\). The IRPC Charter interprets existing human rights law and norms in a legally authoritative way. It has proven effective in persuading national and intergovernmental policymakers, judiciaries, and technical experts as to *why* human rights ‘offline’ not only need to be recognized, but also need to be enforced ‘online’. Since 2014 she has spearheaded a digital and printed booklet edition of the Charter: the “Charter Booklet Project” *.* She has overseen and coordinated with local teams and international networks the translation of the Charter in this booklet form, now in over ten languages; e.g. in its 7<sup>th</sup> English edition, 2<sup>nd</sup> Arabic and Spanish editions, a 1<sup>st</sup> French edition in 2019, and 1<sup>st</sup> Italian edition completed along with Nepalese, Georgian, and Catalan editions underway in 2020. 

 Franklin’s role as expert adviser \(e.g. in UNESCO events, Council of Europe and NGO consultations, such as Amnesty, leading main events at the European Dialogue on Internet Governance \(EuroDIG\), the UN IGF, and UK IGF\) reflects her status as a longstanding, recognized authority on human rights issues across the spectrum of internet policymaking agencies. Her research informs, and supports intergovernmental organizations’ monitoring agencies \(e.g. UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy\), and international human rights organizations’ strategic planning \(e.g. working with Amnesty International internally 2014\-2016\) along with her facilitation of public debates with key actors \(e.g. Amnesty, World Economic Forum, Council of Europe, the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers \(ICANN\), Microsoft, and Google, Dutch and Swiss governmental agencies\). 

 As illustrated above, and in Section 4 below, in this case achieving impact emerges from sustained, long\-term engagements \(2013\-20\) within international internet policy\-making organizations. The links between Franklin’s research and her participation in achieving concrete internet policy objectives based on human rights standards are thereby ‘complex and non\-linear’ \(REF Panel Criteria and Working Methods, p. 321\). The cumulative outcomes and processes her research focuses on, and her contribution to these shifts towards rights\-based frameworks for ‘humanizing’ internet policymaking, and future design, bind the underpinning research to the specific impact detailed in this case study \(Franklin 2019, 2020\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Franklin’s research and participatory engagement within longstanding consultations has: 

 **1. Contributed to official recognition that there is a **fundamental** relationship between internet\-dependent information and communication technologies and human rights** 

 The *Charter Booklet Project*\- Franklin’s work coordinating the translation, design, website resources, and production of language\-editions of the IRPC Charter in booklet form \[S1\] has informed internet governance agendas at the UN, in Europe, Cameroon, Brazil, Latin American, and the Middle East and North African regions \[S2, S3, S6\]: e.g. With Franklin as lead on the Booklet Project, the Charter was cited as a best practice document by the European Agency for Human Rights \(2014\). In the same year, Franklin was instrumental in the admission of IRPC as an official Observer to the Council of Europe’s Committee on Media and the Information Society \(CDMSI\), which she attends on behalf of the coalition \[S4\]. Franklin has also been instrumental in attracting funding from NGOs, Government agencies and crowd sourcing campaigns in order to translate the Charter Booklet into other languages, enabling its use world\-wide; e.g. from NGOs \(Web We Want Foundation\), government agencies \(Dutch International Development Organization \(Hivos\), Swiss Federal Office of Communications \(OFCOM\)\), and funding campaigns \(using crowdsourcing tools\) to support awareness\-raising and facilitate its translation, production and dissemination in all the word’s major languages \(Spanish \[S2\], Arabic – completed during the Arab Uprisings \[S3\], Mandarin – completed during the Umbrella Protests in Hong Kong, and French – used in Francophone Africa\) alongside Kurdish, Farsi, Turkish \(completed in the wake of the Gezi Uprisings\), German, Portuguese, Russian, Italian and most recently into Georgian and Catalan. 

 Under Franklin’s leadership, the IRPC Charter \- through its accessibility in a booklet form \[S1\] \- has become a fundamental point of reference for awareness\-raising, higher education, organization and mobilization around respect and enforcement of civil liberties for the online environment: e.g. as a framework document for the deliberations and outputs of international meetings such as the *NETmundial global multistakeholder meeting on the Future of Internet Governance* \(San Paolo on 23rd April 2014\), and by NGOs working this domain \(e.g. Amnesty \[S2,S8\]\). Franklin’s contribution was mentioned in a keynote from Ms Nnenna Nwakanma \(Ivory Coast\) of the Web We Want Foundation in the NETmundial opening ceremony. The “Multistakeholder Outcome Document” from that meeting drew on the IRPC Charter: as Ms Helga Mieling, Austrian Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology reported, the Charter’s accessibility in Booklet form has been  “important \[as\] a neutral tool quoting the legal basis of the relevant human rights” \[S2\]. 

 By 2016, the Dutch international development agency, Hivos, through its Internet Governance MENA region project \(IG\-MENA\) became inspired by the IRPC Charter as a framework document for regions in which the link between human rights and internet policymaking was not yet recognized. To this end \[text removed for publication\] IG\-MENA program \[text removed for publication\] funded translations of the Charter Booklet into Arabic, Farsi and Kurdish, launched at the 2014 IGF meeting in Istanbul alongside the Turkish language edition. These translations undergirded the successful *Click Rights* campaign that brought the Charter work into Arabic\-language formats for grassroots groups, business leaders and governmental representatives in the region in the lead\-up to the inaugural Arab Internet Governance Forum meeting \[S3\]. 

 **2. Informed intergovernmental incorporations of human rights standards into all aspects of internet\-policy agendas: The Council of Europe \(CDMSI\) and UNESCO \(Freedom of Expression Division\)** 

 On 16 April 2014 the Council of Europe published the *Guide to Human Rights for Internet Users* in a Booklet form modelled on the IRPC Charter Booklet. By July 2015, the Council of Europe’s Committee on Media and the Information Society \(CDMSI\), which oversees internet and media policy agendas for all member states in the Council of Europe, recognized the foundational work of the IRPC by formally appointing the coalition as official observer. It was the first organization of this kind to be invited to attend CDMSI meetings and contribute to intersessional consultations. Franklin presented the case for the coalition to be made an official observer before representatives of the CDMSI’s 47 member\-states \(including the UK\) \[S4\]. 

 In September 2014, Franklin was invited alongside representatives of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers \(ICANN\) to advise UNESCO staff, in Paris and teleconferencing from the field, about the intersection between their human rights work, freedom of expression, and internet policy issues. She presented the IRPC Charter Booklet to this meeting, fielding questions and thereby informing UNESCO’s later Internet Study focusing on freedom of expression, privacy, and ethics. She also contributed to major UNESCO\-hosted consultations on these topics, as speaker and rapporteur at the closing plenary of the 2015 *WSIS\+10* meeting at the UNESCO as part of the UN\-hosted *World Summit on the Information Society* \(WSIS\) official ten\-year review process \[S5\]. 

 **3. Influenced internet and human rights agenda\-setting at the UN Human Rights Council, UN Internet Governance Forum \(IGF\), and European Dialogue on Internet Governance \(EuroDIG\)** 

 Two key appointments at the <ins>UN Human Rights Council</ins> now play an important monitoring role in bringing human rights norms and law to internet policy consultations: the Special Rapporteurs \(SRs\) on the Rights to Freedom of Expression, and on the Right to Privacy. Franklin’s research and policy input has been recognized by the SR on the Right to Privacy \(Joe Cannataci\) and his team through invitations to speak at framework consultations \(2016\-2019\) and contribute to reports from this SR office, e.g. on the Right to Privacy Online, from the perspective of gender and human rights \[S6\]: \[text removed for publication\]. 

 Following her input into these consultations \(Prague 2016, Rome, 2018, Malta 2018\), Franklin was invited speaker to the most recent undertaking of this SR office under the leadership of Dr Coombs \(former Privacy Commissioner for New South Wales, Australia\) and Prof. Cannataci; the Gender and the Right to Privacy Online Privacy Consultation, at the New York Law School in October 2019. Her commissioned policy brief contributed to this Thematic Action Stream Taskforce: \[text removed for publication\] “thanks for your valuable input to the consultation and subsequent follow up.  … There has been considerable interest in the project and the material you provided has assisted with these enquiries also. …The SR on Privacy’s 2020 report to the Human Rights Council which focuses on the 'Recommendations for protecting against gender based privacy infringements', has been placed on the OHCHR website.

 The <ins>UN Internet Governance Forum</ins> \(IGF\) and <ins>European Dialogue on Internet Governance</ins> \(EuroDIG\) meetings \[S1\]: Through her leadership, Franklin has been recognized for her input into the agenda\-setting program and participatory structure for these organizations’ meetings, as coordinator for workshops, plenaries, and main sessions. She also has a public profile as speaker and moderator for landmark sessions in these domains; e.g. on Human Rights, the State, and Surveillance at the 2014 EuroDIG in Berlin, an invited speaker on the Main Session on Youth, Gender, and Human Rights at the 2018 UN Internet Governance Forum meeting in Paris, as co\-organizer \(with Amnesty Germany\) and moderator on the workshop on Ethics and AI at the 2019 IGF meeting in Berlin, and the 2020 IGF meeting that was held entirely online \[S8\]. These sessions and public record produced are the visible part of how agendas in these domains take shape, gain legal focus, and develop social and political traction during months of preparation. 

 **4. Supported and influenced the work of civil society organizations and local government initiatives: e.g. Amnesty International’s internet\-rights strategy; the Digital Cities Coalition, Sir Tim Berners Lee’s Global Contract for the Internet** 

 Franklin was an invited participant in consultations on the setting up of Amnesty International’s digital policy strategy in 2014, presenting insights based on her research at meetings in Berlin and presenting the Charter work to Amnesty delegates in the AGM in Dublin the following year \(Amnesty now has a Technology and Human Rights Division\). She was instrumental in Amnesty’s first participation at the 2014 IGF meeting in Istanbul that year at a landmark workshop with IRPC, Amnesty, Hivos IG\-MENA, and the Council of Europe represented, and where the aforementioned Turkish edition of the Charter Booklet was also launched. At the 2019 IGF Meeting in Berlin Franklin organized and moderated a workshop bringing together European Commission and Amnesty representatives on human rights agendas for Artificial Intelligence R&D. 

 In November 2018 Franklin was invited to present the Charter, as foundational source and corroborating support for the inauguration of the *Digital Cities Coalition* at the 2018 Mozilla Festival \(MozFest\) in London; a coalition between local governments of Amsterdam, Barcelona and New York. The group developed five principles to protect city residents’ “digital rights”, stemming from her guidance and the Charter. As stated in the press release: “…we will share best practices, learn from each other’s challenges and successes, and coordinate common initiatives and actions. Inspired by the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition \(IRPC\), the work of 300 international stakeholders over the past ten years, we are committed to the following five evolving principles…” \[S9\]. 

 Another example of explicit recognition of the IRPC Charter’s influence on public debates and policy agendas was in 2019. Sir Tim Berners\-Lee, Director of the World Wide Web consortium and founder of the World Wide Web Foundation acknowledged the IRPC Charter as source in his *Contract for the Web* calling on governments, companies, and citizens ‘safeguard \[the internet\] from abuse and ensure it benefits humanity’. The *Contract for the Web* has the backing of over 150 organisations \(including Twitter, Google, Facebook\) \[S10\].

<p>This research on internet policy-making processes has led Professor Franklin to lead the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition (IRPC). Since 2014, the IRPC has contributed to official recognition that there is a fundamental relationship between online information, communication technologies, and human rights. IRPC information has informed internet governance at the UN, in Europe, Cameroon, Brazil, Latin America, the Middle East, and North African regions. In 2014, the IRPC Charter was cited as a best practice document by the European Agency for Human Rights. In 2014, the Council of Europe published the Guide to Human Rights for Internet Users modelled on the IRPC Charter Booklet. The IRPC Charter continues to hold influence on public debates and government policies. In 2019, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Director of the World Wide Web consortium and founder of the World Wide Web Foundation, cited the IRPC Charter as a source in his Contract for the Web, a manifesto calling on governments, organisations, and individuals to ‘safeguard [the internet] from abuse and ensure it benefits humanity’. The Contract for the Web is backed by over 150 organisations.

The CLP's work was the first legal research focused entirely on the Cloud, and was funded by Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and the European Commission. It has enabled the development and implementation of legal and governance structures for Cloud Computing services to solve legal uncertainties. These legal governance structures have allowed users to negotiate better terms from Cloud service providers, such as the changing of standard terms to better reflect the needs of organisations including 1,000 UK tertiary education and research institutions. CLP research has also been used to draft European Commission legislation that enables criminal investigations by allowing access to Cloud data.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Professor Franklin’s research on internet\-policymaking processes has informed her leadership of the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition \(IRPC\). Since 2014 Franklin’s work has influenced policymakers, digital rights campaigners, and technology experts during a period in which human rights became recognized as integral to internet design, terms of access, and use. A core element in her impact work has been her role in disseminating the IRPC *Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet* through the “Charter Booklet Project”. Her scholarship and advocacy work have contributed to changing mindsets across the internet policymaking spectrum: where once human rights standards were considered external to the internet’s design, these legal standards and norms now prevail for governments, private sector, and civil society representatives. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Franklin’s research has challenged popular perceptions of the internet as purely a technical, engineering achievement, led by the private sector with little government intervention. Franklin’s findings are based on long\-term, close\-up study of key participants, processes, debates, drafting processes and outcomes of internet\-policy consultations. Her work has been embedded in and, thereby, contributes to the cross\-sector participation characterizing internet policymaking, evidenced by her access to strategic planning, drafting processes, and agenda\-setting consultations. This depth of access provides Franklin with granular knowledge of policymaking processes from within emerging *global internet governance* institutions. She was present and on record \- as researcher and leader in human rights advocacy for the online environment \- in meetings culminating in the UN General Assembly, and Council of Europe each recognizing in 2014 that human rights also exist online and must be respected under international law. 

 In *Digital Dilemmas*, \(2013\), and related publications \(2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020\) Franklin provides \(1\) the empirical evidence of how powerbrokers \(e.g. Google, Facebook, the US State Department, European Union, UN agencies such as UNESCO and the International Telecommunications Union\) compete over the internet’s “narrative of origins”, and \(2\) reveals the stakes, and shifting “terms of engagement” for actors making increasingly publicized decisions about internet futures; e.g. its transmission architecture, technical standards \(Franklin 2013, 2015\) in view of \(3\) the implications of digital, networked systems of surveillance and data\-tracking on human rights law and norms \(2018, 2019\). Franklin’s research undergirds greater awareness in UN, regional, and national domains of how human rights standards \- as fundamental design principle and legal obligation \- remain an ongoing project: a source of conflict and collaboration between internet businesses, regulators, and civil society \(2015, 2020\). 

 Since being invited to stand for election as Co\-Chair of the *Internet Rights and Principles Dynamic Coalition* \(IRPC\) at the UN Internet Governance Forum \(IGF\) \- serving in 2013\-2015, and 2016\-2018, and subsequently re\-elected onto the current Steering Committee \- Franklin has been able to observe the timeline of the *Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet* from the outset \(Franklin 2013, 2015, 2016\). The IRPC Charter interprets existing human rights law and norms in a legally authoritative way. It has proven effective in persuading national and intergovernmental policymakers, judiciaries, and technical experts as to *why* human rights ‘offline’ not only need to be recognized, but also need to be enforced ‘online’. Since 2014 she has spearheaded a digital and printed booklet edition of the Charter: the “Charter Booklet Project” *.* She has overseen and coordinated with local teams and international networks the translation of the Charter in this booklet form, now in over ten languages; e.g. in its 7<sup>th</sup> English edition, 2<sup>nd</sup> Arabic and Spanish editions, a 1<sup>st</sup> French edition in 2019, and 1<sup>st</sup> Italian edition completed along with Nepalese, Georgian, and Catalan editions underway in 2020. 

 Franklin’s role as expert adviser \(e.g. in UNESCO events, Council of Europe and NGO consultations, such as Amnesty, leading main events at the European Dialogue on Internet Governance \(EuroDIG\), the UN IGF, and UK IGF\) reflects her status as a longstanding, recognized authority on human rights issues across the spectrum of internet policymaking agencies. Her research informs, and supports intergovernmental organizations’ monitoring agencies \(e.g. UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy\), and international human rights organizations’ strategic planning \(e.g. working with Amnesty International internally 2014\-2016\) along with her facilitation of public debates with key actors \(e.g. Amnesty, World Economic Forum, Council of Europe, the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers \(ICANN\), Microsoft, and Google, Dutch and Swiss governmental agencies\). 

 As illustrated above, and in Section 4 below, in this case achieving impact emerges from sustained, long\-term engagements \(2013\-20\) within international internet policy\-making organizations. The links between Franklin’s research and her participation in achieving concrete internet policy objectives based on human rights standards are thereby ‘complex and non\-linear’ \(REF Panel Criteria and Working Methods, p. 321\). The cumulative outcomes and processes her research focuses on, and her contribution to these shifts towards rights\-based frameworks for ‘humanizing’ internet policymaking, and future design, bind the underpinning research to the specific impact detailed in this case study \(Franklin 2019, 2020\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Franklin’s research and participatory engagement within longstanding consultations has: 

 **1. Contributed to official recognition that there is a **fundamental** relationship between internet\-dependent information and communication technologies and human rights** 

 The *Charter Booklet Project*\- Franklin’s work coordinating the translation, design, website resources, and production of language\-editions of the IRPC Charter in booklet form \[S1\] has informed internet governance agendas at the UN, in Europe, Cameroon, Brazil, Latin American, and the Middle East and North African regions \[S2, S3, S6\]: e.g. With Franklin as lead on the Booklet Project, the Charter was cited as a best practice document by the European Agency for Human Rights \(2014\). In the same year, Franklin was instrumental in the admission of IRPC as an official Observer to the Council of Europe’s Committee on Media and the Information Society \(CDMSI\), which she attends on behalf of the coalition \[S4\]. Franklin has also been instrumental in attracting funding from NGOs, Government agencies and crowd sourcing campaigns in order to translate the Charter Booklet into other languages, enabling its use world\-wide; e.g. from NGOs \(Web We Want Foundation\), government agencies \(Dutch International Development Organization \(Hivos\), Swiss Federal Office of Communications \(OFCOM\)\), and funding campaigns \(using crowdsourcing tools\) to support awareness\-raising and facilitate its translation, production and dissemination in all the word’s major languages \(Spanish \[S2\], Arabic – completed during the Arab Uprisings \[S3\], Mandarin – completed during the Umbrella Protests in Hong Kong, and French – used in Francophone Africa\) alongside Kurdish, Farsi, Turkish \(completed in the wake of the Gezi Uprisings\), German, Portuguese, Russian, Italian and most recently into Georgian and Catalan. 

 Under Franklin’s leadership, the IRPC Charter \- through its accessibility in a booklet form \[S1\] \- has become a fundamental point of reference for awareness\-raising, higher education, organization and mobilization around respect and enforcement of civil liberties for the online environment: e.g. as a framework document for the deliberations and outputs of international meetings such as the *NETmundial global multistakeholder meeting on the Future of Internet Governance* \(San Paolo on 23rd April 2014\), and by NGOs working this domain \(e.g. Amnesty \[S2,S8\]\). Franklin’s contribution was mentioned in a keynote from Ms Nnenna Nwakanma \(Ivory Coast\) of the Web We Want Foundation in the NETmundial opening ceremony. The “Multistakeholder Outcome Document” from that meeting drew on the IRPC Charter: as Ms Helga Mieling, Austrian Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology reported, the Charter’s accessibility in Booklet form has been  “important \[as\] a neutral tool quoting the legal basis of the relevant human rights” \[S2\]. 

 By 2016, the Dutch international development agency, Hivos, through its Internet Governance MENA region project \(IG\-MENA\) became inspired by the IRPC Charter as a framework document for regions in which the link between human rights and internet policymaking was not yet recognized. To this end \[text removed for publication\] IG\-MENA program \[text removed for publication\] funded translations of the Charter Booklet into Arabic, Farsi and Kurdish, launched at the 2014 IGF meeting in Istanbul alongside the Turkish language edition. These translations undergirded the successful *Click Rights* campaign that brought the Charter work into Arabic\-language formats for grassroots groups, business leaders and governmental representatives in the region in the lead\-up to the inaugural Arab Internet Governance Forum meeting \[S3\]. 

 **2. Informed intergovernmental incorporations of human rights standards into all aspects of internet\-policy agendas: The Council of Europe \(CDMSI\) and UNESCO \(Freedom of Expression Division\)** 

 On 16 April 2014 the Council of Europe published the *Guide to Human Rights for Internet Users* in a Booklet form modelled on the IRPC Charter Booklet. By July 2015, the Council of Europe’s Committee on Media and the Information Society \(CDMSI\), which oversees internet and media policy agendas for all member states in the Council of Europe, recognized the foundational work of the IRPC by formally appointing the coalition as official observer. It was the first organization of this kind to be invited to attend CDMSI meetings and contribute to intersessional consultations. Franklin presented the case for the coalition to be made an official observer before representatives of the CDMSI’s 47 member\-states \(including the UK\) \[S4\]. 

 In September 2014, Franklin was invited alongside representatives of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers \(ICANN\) to advise UNESCO staff, in Paris and teleconferencing from the field, about the intersection between their human rights work, freedom of expression, and internet policy issues. She presented the IRPC Charter Booklet to this meeting, fielding questions and thereby informing UNESCO’s later Internet Study focusing on freedom of expression, privacy, and ethics. She also contributed to major UNESCO\-hosted consultations on these topics, as speaker and rapporteur at the closing plenary of the 2015 *WSIS\+10* meeting at the UNESCO as part of the UN\-hosted *World Summit on the Information Society* \(WSIS\) official ten\-year review process \[S5\]. 

 **3. Influenced internet and human rights agenda\-setting at the UN Human Rights Council, UN Internet Governance Forum \(IGF\), and European Dialogue on Internet Governance \(EuroDIG\)** 

 Two key appointments at the <ins>UN Human Rights Council</ins> now play an important monitoring role in bringing human rights norms and law to internet policy consultations: the Special Rapporteurs \(SRs\) on the Rights to Freedom of Expression, and on the Right to Privacy. Franklin’s research and policy input has been recognized by the SR on the Right to Privacy \(Joe Cannataci\) and his team through invitations to speak at framework consultations \(2016\-2019\) and contribute to reports from this SR office, e.g. on the Right to Privacy Online, from the perspective of gender and human rights \[S6\]: \[text removed for publication\]. 

 Following her input into these consultations \(Prague 2016, Rome, 2018, Malta 2018\), Franklin was invited speaker to the most recent undertaking of this SR office under the leadership of Dr Coombs \(former Privacy Commissioner for New South Wales, Australia\) and Prof. Cannataci; the Gender and the Right to Privacy Online Privacy Consultation, at the New York Law School in October 2019. Her commissioned policy brief contributed to this Thematic Action Stream Taskforce: \[text removed for publication\] “thanks for your valuable input to the consultation and subsequent follow up.  … There has been considerable interest in the project and the material you provided has assisted with these enquiries also. …The SR on Privacy’s 2020 report to the Human Rights Council which focuses on the 'Recommendations for protecting against gender based privacy infringements', has been placed on the OHCHR website.

These sessions and public record produced are the visible part of how agendas in these domains take shape, gain legal focus, and develop social and political traction during months of preparation. 

 **4. Supported and influenced the work of civil society organizations and local government initiatives: e.g. Amnesty International’s internet\-rights strategy; the Digital Cities Coalition, Sir Tim Berners Lee’s Global Contract for the Internet**

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 At a time when NHS statistics record sharply rising numbers of eating disorders \(EDs\) in men and boys, Bartel’s comparative and interdisciplinary research on German and English patient\-centred narratives of EDs in literature and other media has transformed understanding of this complex illness. 

 After engaging with Bartel’s literature\- and arts\-based research and training: 

 1. healthcare practitioners reported dramatic increases in confidence to spot the signs of EDs in men and to begin a conversation with them; 

 2. a major EDs UK charity, First Steps ED, altered its policy and practices; 

 3. an international cohort of professionals working in strategic positions with young people reported growing confidence and knowledge of EDs in males, affecting, in turn, the confidence and knowledge of the young people they support; 

 4. organisations and practitioners in the creative sector in the UK and abroad have adapted their practices. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Bartel’s research explores in six publications the link between narratives, food, family, mental health, disordered eating and gendered identity\-formation, moving from writings by women \( **3**, **4**, **5**\) to those by men \( **1**, **2**, **6**\). Her work on the gendered dimension of food challenges, for example, the stereotype of anorexia nervosa as an illness of affluent white young women only \( **1**\- **6**\), and opens up the discourse of EDs in men and boys \( **1**, **2**, **3**, **6**\). Her research expands existing theories of EDs in German, French, and English women’s writing by showing how German and English literary and non\-literary narratives of EDs in men \( **1**, **2**, **3**, **6**\) can serve to dispute stereotypes and undermine gender binaries in societies and in healthcare systems, using literature and art to ‘Challeng\[e\] Perspectives’ \( **5**\). Her critical evaluation of presentations of men’s struggle to seek help for a perceived ‘unmanly’ mental illness or to embody a particular type of masculinity advances research in the field of gender studies, using the culturally laden acts of eating and feeding to rethink questions of gender, sexuality and masculinity \( **1**, **2**, **3**, **6**\). 

 Furthermore, Bartel’s research facilitates access to the perspectives of a difficult\-to\-reach and under\-represented male patient group, *‘showing the vital role that literature can play in uncovering this largely taboo illness’* \(review one: **1**, p. ii\). Built on interdisciplinary research, Bartel’s work proposes that narratives can raise public awareness, guide practitioners, empower sufferers, and encourage their families and carers. Her collaborative research with an expert in mental health on poems on EDs in males \( **2**\), for example, has underpinned ‘Poems for Doctors’—a collection of texts and video poems that combines the voices of sufferers with those who care for them to inform practice in healthcare. In addition to poetry \( **2**\), Bartel’s research explores autobiographical writing \( **1**\), fiction \( **3,4,5**\), and non\-literary narratives such as photography, animation and performance \( **1**, **6**\). Her work on these illness narratives addresses a growing demand for Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement \(PPIE\), and presents concrete recommendations for improvements to healthcare \( **1**, **2**\). This has led, for instance, to the AHRC showcasing her work as *‘a great example of the importance of arts and humanities approaches in mental health research’* \(AHRC Senior Manager\). 

 Bartel’s monograph, *Men Writing Eating Disorders* \( **1**\), is the result of her interdisciplinary work since 2016 and the first book to evaluate contemporary German and English autobiographical writings on EDs in men as a discourse\-shaping body of work. It forges new narrative directions for autobiographical writing by accommodating previously unheard illness and life experiences. In addition, this comparative study of 21 texts from the UK, North America, Germany and Austria \( **1**\) highlights shared themes across linguistic and national boundaries, thus adding a new transcultural angle to the topic. 

 Since 2016, Bartel has led three interdisciplinary projects, bringing together international arts and humanities scholars, medical experts, charities, carers and experts by experience to interconnect socio\-cultural, medical, psychological, gendered, artistic and literary perspectives of EDs in males. Supported by three research grants \[ **G1**\- **2:** AHRC; **G3**: Wellcome\], her projects analysed how men articulate their EDs \[ **G1**\] and communicate experiences of primary healthcare \[ **G2**; **G3**\], this has led, among other outcomes, to co\-designed resources such as the animation ‘Consider EDs in Men’, which is central to Bartel’s 2020 training tool used by the Royal Colleges of General Practitioners, Nursing and Psychiatrists.

 Harnessing her research on verbal and non\-verbal illness narratives \( **1**\- **6**\), Bartel led the creation of an animated clinical training tool, ‘Consider EDs in Men’, that ‘ *gives insight into the mindset of the patient*’ with an ED, and presents an arts\-based ‘ *multi\-media approach \[that\] helps reinforce the issues*’ \[ **I**:2\]. This patient\-centred resource earned accreditation by the Royal College of GPs \(RCGP\) in 2020, which, in turn, recommends it to its 50,000\+ members. RCGP directors emphasize the tool’s ability ‘ *to improve the quality of GP practice and patient experience*’ \[ **I**:2\], and praise it as ‘ *fantastic*— *so powerful and so different to the usual message* *given to GPs*’ \[ **E**:21\-22\]. The tool has also achieved official endorsement from the Royal Colleges of Nursing \(RCN, 450,000 members\) and Psychiatrists \(RCPsych, 19,000 members\), with the Chair of RCPsych Scotland recommending the resource as ‘ *incredibly useful’* \[ **I**:4\]. Although Covid\-19 has dominated healthcare since March 2020, within seven months of its launch \(May 2020\) the tool has facilitated dramatically increased awareness and knowledge among GPs, nurses, mental health professionals, and healthcare students. Among the 140 direct respondents in the UK, Bartel’s training generated significant increases in practitioners feeling more confident \(after training\) to: 1. spot the signs of EDs in men \(19% <span style=""font-family: Wingdings"">&#xF0E0;</span>85%\); 2. begin a conversation with a male patient about his eating \(32% <span style=""font-family: Wingdings"">&#xF0E0;</span>87%\); and 3. know when to refer a patient to a specialist EDs service \(18% <span style=""font-family: Wingdings"">&#xF0E0;</span>77%\) \[ **E**:1\]. According to a RCGP Clinical Champion, commissioned by UoN to analyse the data and 15 expert\-testimonials \[ **A**\], the training\-results present *‘an extraordinary gain in confidence among professionals who are commonly ‘“not seeing” \[i.e. not identifying\] patients with these issues because they are unaware of how they might present’* \[ **A:**4\]. The results indicate significant shifts in practice to improve the primary care of males with EDs, and these promise to ‘ *trigger behaviour change*’ in GPs, according to an RCGP official \[ **I**:2\]\). In health practitioners’ own words: the tool has *‘change\[d\] my daily practice making me more aware, confident and sensitive’* \[ **E**:5\], or *‘influenced me to become more observant and vigilant’* \[ **E**:12\]. The RCGP Clinical Champion’s evaluation summarizes the impact of the animated training tool as: *‘1. Training gaps addressed; 2. Symptom knowledge improved, 3. Raising awareness, 4. Building confidence in consultation skills; 5. Better adherence to guidelines, 6. Creating hope; 7. Assumptions and bias successfully challenged, 8. Providing more holistic care, 9. Helpful myth busting, 10. Leaving a lasting impression’* \[ **A**:3\-6\]. 

 With 86% of the 140 respondents reporting initially no knowledge of any other specialist resource on EDs in men \[ **E:**1\], Bartel’s tool, underpinned by her research into men’s illness narratives \( **1**, **2**, **6**\), fills *‘a shocking and important gap in the post\-graduate psychology/psychiatry education agenda’* \[ **A**:6\], and will improve patient care, according to an RCGP official \[ **I**:1\]. Testament to this, the animated training tool \(accessible through subtitles in seven languages\) has also been taken up by: 1. the charity Mental Health First Aid England to train their 2,300 instructors \[ **C**:4\]; 2. the two largest UK ED charities, Beat and First Steps ED, for training of staff and professionals \[ **B**; **E**:23\]; 3. government\-funded health organisations abroad to be adapted in 2021 for use in Germany \[ **G**\] and Australia \[ **E**:24\-25\]; 4. UoN’s School of Health Sciences for two BSc nursing courses \(380 students; 2020/21\)—this School has also recommended it to the Council of Deans in Health Sciences at 85 UK HEIs \(reach 110,000 students\) \[ **F**:2\]. 

 Underpinned by Bartel’s research \( **1**\- **6**\), the animation presents a ‘ *range of voices*’ \[ **I**:2\]. It builds on her previous 2018 AHRC\-funded multimedia project ‘Poems for Doctors’ on EDs in men \( **2**\), which has informed current and future healthcare professionals at six national and international events \(combined audience: ca. 700\) \[ **E**:27\-47\]. Clinical participants in Bartel’s ED masterclass \(2019\) reported: *‘This made me stop & think & re\-evaluate my practice as a dietician, to consider eating disorders when I am assessing patients’;* heightened awareness of an *‘unconscious gender bias regarding eating disorders’*; *‘Reminding practitioners of the human experience of disease helps garner true empathy & therefore better holistic care’* \[ **E**:46\]. One GP reported that her resulting heightened awareness made a tangible difference: *‘Within a week, I had identified one man \[…\] who had an underlying ED’* \[ **E**:21\]. In the words of a world\-leading clinical psychiatrist in EDs, Bartel’s ‘Poems for Doctors’ are helping ‘ *to root work on male EDs in a wider movement in health research to engage with experts by experience*’ \[ **H**\] **.** 

 As one nurse summed up the particular impact of Bartel’s combination of narrative, art and clinical information: *‘I am unlikely to forget these voices of men in my future practice’* \[ **E**:6\]. 

 <ins>2</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>C</ins><ins>hanging policy at organisational level:</ins> <ins>ED</ins> <ins>charity First</ins> <ins>Steps</ins> <ins>ED \(FSED\)</ins> 

 Since 2018 Bartel’s role as Research Advisor has changed FSED’s policy and practice, helping it to become the second largest ED UK charity in the UK \[ **B**\]. Its CEO reported seven points of policy change and expansion as a *‘direct result of our collaboration and knowledge exchange with her* \[Bartel\]’ leading to *‘a step change in how male EDs are considered and treated by a range of stakeholders’* \[ **B**\]. Bartel’s international research collaborations and expertise in training has helped FSED become a *‘leading national charity in its specific focus on \[…\] EDs in males’*, inspiring a *‘new and dedicated service model exclusively available for boys and men’* \[ **B**\]. This increased \(self\) referrals to FSED by men \(aged 18–32\) by 12%, and by 8–15 year\-old males by 35% in 2019/20. FSED’s annual income also doubled from £487,830 in 2018/19 to £1,008,666 in 2019/20 due to Bartel’s recommendations for innovating service models and research funding \[ **B**\]. This money co\-finances two FT staff members, including a unique Boys and Men Lead for Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement \(PPIE\) helping FSED to *‘target its training and activities for males in ways we weren’t able to before’* \[ **B**\]. For their joint work in promoting public understanding for EDs in males, Bartel and FSED have been shortlisted for the national 2020 Men & Boys Award for *‘outstanding achievement in providing care, compassion and social change for men and boys’* \(UK charity Men & Boys Coalition\), and for UoN’s 2020 ‘Best Public Engagement Award’.

 The 14 teachers from seven regional schools, and the 13 staff from six UK HEIs attending a day’s training run by charity Mental Health First Aid England with Bartel \(2017; 2018\), had significant pastoral and line management responsibilities, making their rise in confidence levels \(after training\) to support students with mental health issues/EDs of strategic value: from 5.97 to 8.23 on a scale of 0–10 \(2017\) \[ **C**:16\]. Bartel’s contribution on ED\-narratives gave participants greater knowledge of EDs in men: it *‘improve\[d\] my knowledge of the range of people who are affected by eating disorders. \[…\] I had a gendered perception of the disorders’* \[ **C**:41\], and *‘I genuinely feel more confident to approach young people \[…\] about mental health’* \[ **C**:18\]. Participants reported plans for changes in schools as a result of the training, e.g. mental health action initiatives, fundraising for books, lunchtime drop\-ins, and reshaping PSE \(Personal and Social Education\) programmes: *‘The training influence\[d\] the way we, as a school, teach about mental health and eating disorders and the resources enabled me to put together a \[PSE\] scheme of work’* \[ **C**:100\]. 

 As Board Member \(since 2019\) of Nottingham’s White Hills Park Trust \(four local academies\), Bartel uses narratives to influence practices to aid education about gendered body image issues and mental health. In February 2020 she started ‘Shelf Help for EDs’, a reading programme on EDs, in one school, with plans to roll it out regionally to schools and public libraries \(Covid\-delayed\) \[ **C**:103\-104\]. As Local Advisor to the youth\-led NHS\-commissioned project ‘Mental Health 2000’, Bartel engaged 31 young people \(aged 14–25\) in her narrative research in mental health, helping them to communicate to their peers problems that are often stigmatised, including EDs in males. These insights found their way into a youth\-led poster campaign, advised by Bartel \( **1**, **6**\) \(presented online instead of ‘live’ across Nottinghamshire due to Covid; Sept. 2020\). Its slogans communicated the young people’s findings about mental health and ED stereotypes: ‘ *Why should I man up?*’; and ‘ *What is normal anyway?*’ \[ **C**:89\]. 

 As representative for EDs in Student Services, Bartel has helped the UK charity Student Minds to shape its ED Audit Expert Panel’s response to Covid\-19 and what this pandemic means for HE students with EDs, including male students and those identifying as male \[ **C:**91\-92\]. Using social media Bartel has reached a broad audience \(March–Dec. 2020\): 4,411 views on Youtube; 250 likes on Twitter, YouTube and UoN homepage \[ **E**:62\-69\]. 

 Focusing on educating pupils, Bartel’s two one\-day events about art, literature and ‘Good Mental Health’, with a total of 112 \(72\+40\) pupils from seven East Midlands secondary schools \(Jan. 2017; April 2019\), resulted in 92% of 72 students reporting greater awareness \(2017\) and 83% of 40 better knowledge \(2019\) regarding EDs in boys and men; one teacher was particularly impressed to see the boys ‘ *open up*’ \[ **C:**98\]. Five arts\-centred public events introduced Bartel’s work to diverse public audiences, including pupils and students: one reading for 40 pupils of Sam Pollen’s 2019 teenage novel *The Year I Didn’t Eat* about a boy’s ED \(2019\); one exhibition for approx. 200 \(‘Wonder’ at UoN, 2018\); ‘Drop\-in Cafés’ commissioned twice for the national ‘Being Human Festival’ \(Nov. 2018; Nov. 2020\) for ca. 80; and one stand\-up comedy gig by a comedian recovered from an ED \(Jan. 2018\). 85% attendees of this gig \(29\) agreed that it helped them *‘to think about male EDs in a new way*’, and one wrote: *‘You have given me the confidence to speak up about my own problems with food*— *as a man\! Thank you\!’* \[ **C**:11\]. 

 <ins>4</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Impact a</ins><ins>mong creative organisations and practitioners</ins> 

 In 2018 Bartel collaborated with the film company Simply Thrilled \(ST\) to produce five videos from the 13 ‘Poems for Doctors’ \(see above\) with a diverse group, including men with experience of EDs. Inspired by the poems’ capacity to challenge audiences’ preconceptions and \(visual\) stereotypes \( **2**\), ST’s CEO states that they learned to be *‘particularly conscious about our use of perspective, camera angles, frames and cuts and \[…\] we were especially careful about delivering intimate close\-up shots whilst still retaining the personal integrity of the individual’* \[ **D**:12\]. ST’s creative take on the theme of ‘control’ was especially pertinent and informed by Bartel’s research \( **1**, **2**\) \[ **D**:12\]. Working with Bartel on EDs has given ST *‘new impulses to rethink and refine practices that we have since applied in other productions’*, e.g. for DARE, a drugs awareness charity for young people \[ **D**:12\]. A male author and performer with experience of EDs evaluated the impact of Bartel’s research \( **1,2**\) on creative practice generally, and on ST: *‘these \[…\] creative decisions have a huge effect on the overall product as it makes participants more comfortable, considered and protected, meaning that they are more likely to share honest portrayals of their struggles which will help others’* \[ **D**:2\]. Furthermore, Bartel’s research into arts\-based communications of EDs \( **1**\- **6**\) informed her collaboration with the animation studio WovenInk on the training film for NHS healthcare ‘Consider EDs in Men’ \[Aug. 2019–March 2020, **D**:13\], nominated for the 2021 WHO ‘Health for All’ film award. This has shaped WovenInk’s profile to establish themselves as *the* company for arts\-based educational campaigns on EDs leading, for instance, to a 2020 film\-project by the ED charity FREED: ‘Social Media, Food and Me’. Since 2016 Bartel has also changed the practices of four other creative practitioners. A well\-known German author has, through Bartel’s research \( **4**, **5**\), gained ‘ *a new awareness for the real impact of \[a\] particular story*’ she wrote about EDs in a family context \(‘Salzwasser’; Saltwater; 2010\). At public readings she now introduces and reads this story with a heightened sensitivity to the range of possible audience responses \[ **D**:15\-16\]. Bartel’s research \( **1**, **2**\) has also since influenced this author’s choice of topics for her further creative work \[ **D**:16\]. Bartel also enabled a UK stand\-up comedian to trial a comedy gig on his own experience of EDs in Nottingham \(Jan. 2018\). This led to him performing the material at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2019 \[ **D**:17\] and to designing an NHS\-funded programme of workshops on stand\-up comedy, mental health and EDs \[ **D**:17\]. Bartel’s scholarship \( **1**, **2**, **6**\), has also ‘ *changed and enriched*’ \[ **J**\] the work of an acclaimed Austrian documentary photographer. Bartel’s research is now included in this artist’s patient\-centred photobook and international touring exhibition *A Story to Tell:* *Regarding Male EDs* \( **6**\) adding ‘ *new theoretical perspectives to our work making it even more effective as an intervention*’ \[ **J**\]. 

 Finally, one poet \(a participant in ‘Poems for Doctors’\) whose poem Bartel recorded with a young rap artist, sums up the overall thrust of Bartel’s research and its benefits for others: *‘finding voices to articulate such a difficult and under\-explored area will change things’* \[ **D**:22\].

The following close readings of a selection of stories will outline how intimately Sandig’s narrative approach links form and content. The stories focus on the solitary or ‘odd’ individual, on gaps or missing pieces in the sequence of events, on the Fluchtpunkte or vanishing points that the seemingly limited narrative perspective in each story leads to. The stories with their detached tone and understated manner are about an unstable, uncentred world. Cumulatively these views from the margins build up a bigger picture, a mosaic composed from otherwise only loosely connected pieces.

<p>Professor Widdows’ research contributed to the theory of ‘lookism’ (used to name appearance discrimination in activist circles) and the integration of the #EverydayLookism campaign into NGO practices and campaign messaging. In the three weeks following its launch, the #EverydayLookism campaign received 74,886 video views, 13,449 engagements, and 1.03 million people saw the campaign. To date (at time of ICS authorship), the EverydayLookism blogs have over 46,000 views and the campaign has received over 800 story submissions. Anti-bullying campaign Ditch the Label included a chapter on lookism in the Annual Bullying Survey for the first time in 2019. The Mental Health Foundation’s briefing paper ‘Image-editing Apps and Mental Health’ recommended engagement with #EverydayLookism. Widdows’ comments in support of this paper were quoted in 264 outlets, reaching an audience of 11.6 million. Widdows’ work was instrumental in the intervention of the Nuffield Council of Bioethics (NCoB) in the report ‘Cosmetic Procedures: Ethical Issues’ (2017).
