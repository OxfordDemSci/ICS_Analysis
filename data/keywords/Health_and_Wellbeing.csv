 **1. summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 uk nursing trainees are better prepared to deliver patient\-centred care as a result of ‘taking care’ \(tc\), a mixed methods drama research project. tc has so far benefited nursing educators at 16 heis, and over 2,500 trainees, by bringing the tools and resources to teach ethical care and communication skills into their nursing curricula. tc is also shaping pedagogical conversations in the sector as an exemplar of the utility of performance\-making methods in healthcare education more generally, and has brought arts and health practitioners and policymakers together to their mutual benefit. consequently, tc has made a systematic incorporation of arts\-based approaches to healthcare education a much higher priority, and triggered the formation of the new, nationwide performance and care working group.

 **2. underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 the 2013 francis report, investigating the failures of the mid staffordshire nhs trust, detailed the negative impact of inadequate nursing care and hospital understaffing on patient health outcomes, most notably increased mortality rates. its key recommendations included an ethos of ‘putting the patient first’, and training to ensure prospective nurses are sufficiently ‘caring’ individuals. ‘taking care’ \(tc\), a body of drama research undertaken by kingston university \(ku\) and guildhall school of music & drama \(gsmd\), identifies and addresses two significant challenges faced by nursing educators in the face of these imperatives: a\) how to teach the sensitive and effective communication of ‘care’, and b\) how to prepare students for the demanding emotional labour required by their profession. tc’s central output is the series of performances *careful* \[r1\], and the project also draws upon and feeds into a body of research comprising reflective \[r2; r3; r4\] and pedagogic \[r5\] works. because this project operates iteratively and in conjunction with its stakeholders, the underpinning research and its impact are interwoven. 

 the use of arts\-based tools in the pedagogy of other fields is fairly well established, especially in medical education, but is under\-researched and \-utilised in nursing training specifically. the nursing and midwifery council’s response to the francis report’s criticisms promoted nurses’ cultivation of ‘compassion’ and ‘care’ to embed patient\-centred practice. however, a focus on ‘compassion’ overlooks the skilled nature of this practice, and the emotional toll it takes on the caregiver. disregarding the first leads to low recruitment and the second to burnout, manifested in high attrition rates, ultimately resulting in poor patient outcomes. within the existing nursing curriculum there is little attention to how trainees might ‘care’ for patients in demanding workplaces without compromising their own emotional wellbeing. 

 nurses occupy a distinct position in healthcare due to their increased emotional exposure and the perceived lack of skill and professionalism attached to ‘care’, and for hospital patients and their families nurses are the most frequent point of contact with staff. small gestures such as word choice, tone of voice and stance can carry strong emotional significance, especially in vulnerable moments. this was observed first\-hand by tc’s principal investigator, drama researcher\-practitioner alex mermikides, while caring for a seriously ill close relative. thus there are parallels between nursing and theatrical practice, as in clinical interactions nurses and patients watch each other as audiences watch performers, attuned to the ‘meaning’ of their actions. drawing on these similarities, tc explores the relationship between drama and healthcare education. 

 tc began with a five\-month residency in ku’s nursing school \(summer 2016, supported by arts council england\). mermikides used ethnographic and archival research methods \(including access to unpublished interviews with nurses who trained or worked at st george’s hospital, regular meetings with nursing teaching staff and lesson observations\) to explore how nurses learn to perform care. following this, mermikides conducted research workshops with a team of professional performers, nursing trainees and educators. these combined practical activities to test different uses of performance skills, analysis of existing dramatic representations of nursing, and discussions and focus group interviews. these workshops form a wing of the research practice at the heart of tc: ‘devising’ \(a collaborative, democratic tool for performance\-making, its ethos underpins tc in both subject and methodology\). 

 during the devising process, mermikides’ ensemble created fictional scenarios based on the five central themes emerging from the background research: caring too much; being unable to provide adequate attention; ‘difficult’ patients, vigilance exhaustion; and \(following the francis report\) fear of being judged. the ensemble used physical theatre techniques to get ‘under the skin’ of nurses by observing and embodying basic nursing procedures, and translating them into choreographed movement. rehearsals and early work\-in\-progress performances took place in a simulated ward, with the audience in beds to accentuate the theatrical nature of nurse\-patient interactions. this device foregrounded nurses’ perspectives while putting viewers in the patient’s position, highlighting the intersubjectivity and embodied aspect of clinical encounters and demonstrating care as a *skill* \[r3; r4\]. these expressionistic and immersive elements mean that the resulting performance is distinct from the ‘naturalistic’ style more commonly used in healthcare education. each subsequent performance has developed the show further, in response to audience feedback \(post\-show discussions, focus groups, questionnaires\) and ongoing desk research. 

 the process of devising *careful* revealed that care can be understood as a skilled practice rather than an inherent virtue. like performance, it depends on subtle orchestrations of words, gestures, bodies and space in order to convey emotion and meaning. approaches used to train physical theatre performers are therefore shown to be adaptable for nursing education, to help nurses manage the unique emotional content of their clinical encounters. above all, tc research led to a reconception of care as a relational feedback loop, countering the pervasive view that compassionate care is conferred from nurse to patient \[r4\]. 

 initial performances of *careful* were staged in ku’s simulated hospital ward \(september 2016\), rose theatre studio \(november 2016\), and at the university of surrey’s ivy arts centre \(march 2017\), mostly to trainee nurses. positive audience response led ku nursing department to invite mermikides to teach the insights and techniques arising from tc via a practical class for year 1 bsc adult nursing students at ku \(june 2017\). following mermikides’ move to gsmd in july 2017, two further classes for years 2 and 3 \(launched in summer 2018 and 2019\), a headline performance in the main house at the rose \(summer 2018\), digital workpacks \(may 2020; \[r5\]\), and a *careful* tour \(postponed due to covid\-19\) have been commissioned, researched and developed. dissemination activities also include a major symposium, performance for care, co\-convened by mermikides.

 **4. details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 the most direct impact has been on the estimated 2,500 trainee nurses exposed to performances of the show and/or its associated learning resources. linked is the impact on pedagogy more broadly, with 15 higher education institutions \(heis\) and 1 nhs hospital committing to integrate tc’s findings into their training in the form of performances, practical classes or uptake of remote resources. there is also a developing impact at a national arts and healthcare education policy level with early signs of buy\-in from several key stakeholders. 

###  impact on trainees/professionals: ‘sometimes nursing is like theatre’ \(student quoted in \[e1\]\) 

 to date, tc research findings have been rendered into later iterations of *careful* \[r1\], 3 practical classes for ku students \(one for each year of study\) and a pair of interactive digital workpacks \[r5\] created in response to the move to online learning due to covid\-19. 

 over 600 nursing students at ku have participated in the classes, with one cohort of 200 students having participated in a class in each year of their degree programme. participants reported enhanced awareness of the embodied, interpersonal and affective dimensions of their role, and increased confidence about managing both their own and their patients’ emotions \[e1\]. the learning from these classes has had a lasting effect on participants’ clinical practice. according to an article in the nursing standard: ‘ *around 90% of those taking part think the workshops will have a positive effect on their practice, while around 85% said they had drawn on the learning during their next placement*’ \[e2\]. likewise, reports suggested ‘ *in each* \[class\] *a potential impact of awareness or implementation was recorded for at least 90% of participants*’ \[e1\]. as one student reported, the classes also help to bridge the gap between theory and practice: “ *i really understand what i am writing about communication in my essay instead of just reading about it*” \[e1\]. 

 trainee and established professionals report changes of perspective about their professional practice as a result of viewing *careful*, the live performances of which have been seen by 600 trainees in addition to over 1,200 views of the recording. a trainee reflects, ‘ *there were elements of dance in the performance, which is obviously physically demanding.* \[…\] *it made me realise that, as nurses, we are also on our feet for 12 hours. our priority is to meet everyone else’s physical needs but we don’t have that empathy towards ourselves. it felt like a reality check’* \[e2\]. even very experienced nurses have found that tc’s findings have changed their perspectives: ‘ *one of the reasons i stopped being involved with nursing is because i’ve been trying to talk about these things* \[the findings of mermikides’ research\] *for years and nobody cared.* \[…\] *there’s something here, in* \[mermikides’\] *work, that allows us to reinterrogate what we fail to do for* \[…\] *people who have decided to lend us their heart* \[i.e. nurses\] \[…\] *and that somehow we still collectively and culturally abandon’* \[e3\]. 

 an estimated 1,300 students at 9 uk and european institutions have received digital workpacks created in response to the covid\-19 pandemic. initially developed for ku, where 600 trainees have engaged with them, 3 other heis subsequently requested access to the packs. on the basis of this interest, they were offered to and taken up by another 5 heis, 2 of which appointed mermikides to lead online classes centred on the packs as a result. the first workpack ensured that findings from *careful* \(sensitising students to the ways their embodiment can affect patients’ feelings\) can be delivered through remote learning. the second adapts strategies used by performers to cope with the demands of performance to help students who entered practice earlier than anticipated due to covid\-19 handle stress. 

###  impact on nursing curricula: ‘a hugely significant contribution to nursing pedagogy’ \[e6\] 

 mermikides’ research, and the sustained collaboration it involved with two nursing lecturers at ku, has led to the expansion of the adult nursing degree programme to include tc workshops as core curriculum in all year groups. this is especially significant given the ‘crowded’ and highly\-regulated nature of the nursing curriculum. 

 the utility of mermikides’ research for nursing pedagogy has also been recognised by other heis; 11 heads of department committed to host performances of *careful* together with post\-show discussions and staff development events in 2020. this includes edinburgh napier university, which secured a teaching fellowship for mermikides with a value of approximately gbp10,000 to enable more extensive consultation. the resulting tour of *careful* was disrupted due to covid\-19, but the firm commitment to these activities in itself signifies impact on the established practice of nursing education. several of these institutions have sustained the relationship despite this disruption, through uptake of the digital workpacks. an example is the university of the west of england \(uwe\) where ‘ *the online resources* \[mermikides\] *provided are being used in two nursing modules*’ \[e4\]. uwe also appointed mermikides to run a webinar introducing tc performance\-based approaches to healthcare lecturers \(20 september 2020\). this attracted 40 participants from uwe and beyond, reflecting the fact that ‘ *discussions around the use of arts\-based approaches to teaching and learning in the department of nursing & midwifery* \[at uwe\] *have increased since we have become aware of* \[mermikides’\] *work’* \[e7\]. 

 two of the most important nursing skills, as identified by marie curie \(2016\) and the royal college of nursing \(2016\), are sensitive and effective communication and emotional resilience. however, these are both difficult to teach and often squeezed out of a curriculum that prioritises medical knowledge. tc’s research processes and findings offer practical, research\-backed methods and insights, which have been ‘ *transformational to the teaching staff and nursing students it has involved*’ \[e2\]. tc has provided the nursing education sector with meaningful pedagogical tools that can support the development of overlooked skills. tc also offers a model for how collaborations across the arts and humanities and healthcare might develop to deliver similar outcomes in other areas. 

###  impact on arts and health policy: ‘this work has advanced thinking’ \[e5\] 

 in march 2020 mermikides convened a virtual symposium, ‘performance for care’ \( [www.performanceforcare.com](http://www.performanceforcare.com/)\), in partnership with king’s college london and the king’s fund, designed to pursue the policy implications of the tc project. this attracted over 400 healthcare educators and arts and health practitioners and policymakers internationally. the president of the royal college of nursing wrote that ‘ *the performance for care event revealed the need for more systematic survey of how performance is being used in nursing education across the uk’* \[e6\]. as a result of the symposium, the deputy head of research and evaluation at public health wales set up the performance and care working group, ‘ *developing a new national group that is bringing together people working across nursing, performance and the arts to start doing a lot more work in that area* \[…\] *. dr mermikides has been the group’s anchor in terms of its theoretical and philosophical underpinnings’* \[e7\]. mermikides was invited to be a core member of this uk\-wide group and to give a keynote presentation at its inaugural event ‘performing for real’ in november 2020. 

 performance for care also alerted the uk’s all\-party parliamentary group \(appg\) for arts, health and wellbeing to the ‘ *considerable*’ policy implications of tc \[e5\]. as a result, mermikides had several meetings with an appg representative, which served to inform and re\-prioritise their strategy to address recommendation 8 of their creative health report 2017 \(‘that the education of clinicians, public health specialists and other health and care professionals includes accredited modules on the evidence base and practical use of the arts for health and wellbeing’\). for them, ‘ *mermikides’ research is helping to shape the conversation about how the arts can enhance interpersonal skills within the healthcare workforce, thereby improving patient satisfaction and, in some cases, health outcome*s’ \[e5\]. mermikides was invited to present the tc project at a roundtable event on the theme of care in november 2020. 

 one of tc’s biggest successes is its evaluative underpinnings, which prove the efficacy of physical theatre as an educational tool. as noted by the appg, ‘\[t\] *here is a significant evidence gap around the arts’ role in health and wellbeing, specifically for nursing education.* \[…\] *mermikides’ work is helping to fill that gap’* \[e5\]. the evidence base built in to tc’s research design has also been praised by public health wales: ‘\[p\] *roving that it works as a contribution to* \[these\] *pedagogical challenge*\[s\] *for nursing studies has been core’* \[e7\]. 

 the impact on the ‘arts in healthcare’ sector through changed perception and reception of such initiatives is further underscored by clod ensemble, a pioneer of arts\-based medical education that has engaged with mermikides’ research since 2014. they write that: ‘ *by showing how the practice is underpinned by theory from applied arts and performance studies, dr mermikides’ work has helped to make the case for the growth of practical interventions of these kinds.* \[…\] *mermikides’ research has profoundly influenced the sector within which our work exists’* \[e8\]. 

###  the cherry on top: ‘elevating nursing’ \[e9\] 

 the necessity and power of tc’s tools of representation is significant not just for increasing staff retention and enabling more ‘care\-ful’ clinical encounters, but for morale and professional integrity; as one student nurse audience member of *careful* \(who also participated in research workshops and is now in practice\) reflected in *the guardian*, ‘ *elevating nursing to the level of art gave me another reason to be proud of the choice i have made to become one*’ \[e9\].

###  1. summary of the impact 

 doping violates the spirit of sports and is potentially damaging to both the careers and health of athletes, yet it persists. indeed, the prevalence of the use of performance enhancing drugs in sport is a dynamic challenge that is continuously evolving. the king’s college london drug control centre \(dcc\) is at the forefront of introducing advances in anti\-doping science, contributing to both research and providing state\-of\-the\-art laboratory services to both national and international anti\-doping agencies. the dcc has developed unique research and analytical improvements to laboratory methods which have led to a strengthening in the uk’s anti\-doping programme. research has been integrated into the practice and policy of the world anti\-doping agency and has been used successfully to support anti\-doping efforts at international competitions and major games around the world. in addition, dcc research has been integral to high profile international anti\-doping investigations such as the 2016 mclaren report, which identified numerous anti\-doping violations in russia. 
","
###  2. underpinning research 

 as doping agents evolve and new ways of cheating develop, the requirement to monitor banned substances and maintain analytical competency in sport drug testing means anti\-doping is a continuous challenge for scientists. researchers at the king’s college london dcc have undertaken investigations targeted at increasing the understanding and detection of the compounds misused by athletes. the approach has been to detect an ever\-greater number of prohibited substances at low concentrations in biological fluids, whilst enhancing testing capability, increasing the quality of analytical data, its sensitivity, and its evidential quality. new knowledge in enhancing the fight against doping in sport as a result of the research from the dcc is outlined in the two examples below. 

 **i. improving the detection of human growth hormone \(hgh\)** 

 hgh is a naturally occurring peptide hormone also available for medicinal purposes in a recombinant form \(rhgh\). its attraction as a doping agent in sport, includes the reduction of body fat, a potential increase in muscle mass and strength \(anabolic effect\), and tissue\-repairing effects \(recovery and increased collagen synthesis\). however, distinguishing natural hgh from the recombinant forms and marked inter\-individual variability makes detection of doping extremely difficult. initial work saw king’s researchers use acetonitrile protein depletion with a 5 min ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry \(uhplc/ms/ms\)‐based selected reaction monitoring \(srm\) assay to detect both insulin\-like growth factor i \(igf‐i\) and leucine‐rich α‐2‐glycoprotein \(lrg\) at endogenous concentrations in human serum as a viable means of protein quantification in sports competitors \[1\]. the dcc scientists, in collaboration with endocrinologists at the university of southampton, then worked to improve the detection of hgh administration by athletes using a biomarker approach: an indirect method to target biomarkers related to hgh that remain in the body for longer \[2,3\]. king’s researchers successfully advanced the development of methods for the detection of igf\-i and the pro\-collagen type iii n\-terminal peptide \(p\-iii\-np\) \[2,4\]. since 2015, this collaborative research has improved the test through the introduction of robust and validated decision limits based on the “gh score” \(calculated using the igf\-i and p\-iii\-np concentrations\). these limits are now applied to samples from athletes for the detection of hgh administration, offering a more sensitive analytical approach \[5\] and have been approved for use by the world anti\-doping agency \(wada\). 

#  the detection and quantification of proteins, in particular of peptide hormones in urine, has continued to pose analytical challenges in sports testing. historically, testing has relied on the measurement of relevant biomarkers using immunoassay tests, which have been associated with varied performance, poor correlation among methods and differential cross\-reactivity. king’s researchers developed a superior approach for the analysis of igf\-i and p\-iii\-np peptides with improved sensitivity and evidential quality \[6\]. they were able to differentiate between exogenous \(illicit\) peptides and those found endogenously in the body by pioneering the use of tryptic digestion and subsequent micro/nano\-liquid chromatography\-mass spectrometry \(lc\-ms\), with two surrogate tryptic peptides \(ht1 and t5\) for the mass spectrometric confirmation of p\-iii\-np. this facilitated the detection of p\-iii\-np in a human serum sample by lc\-ms for the first time \[6\]. this research has been recognised by awards such as the barber prize for mass spectrometry \(british mass spectrometry society, 2017\) and best article \(partnership for clean competition funded research, 2018\). 

#  ii. developing novel anti\-doping methods to identify illegal sample manipulation 

#  ensuring the integrity of the biological samples provided by athletes is critical to the anti\-doping system. athletes seeking to subvert the system may try to manipulate their sample in such a way that the subsequent analytical results are less likely to demonstrate that they have been taking a prohibited substance. an example of this behaviour is providing an alternative “clean urine” sample from themselves or a colleague which can negatively affect the analytical data. to solve this problem the dcc developed sensitive and rapid methods to detect and profile dna within an athlete’s urine \[7\]. this meant that it was now possible to verify that the <ins>correct</ins> athlete provided the sample.

###  4. details of the impact 

 the king’s college london dcc seeks to protect both the integrity of sport and the health of athletes and is the only wada accredited laboratory in the uk. the dcc aims to increase awareness of the danger of doping for the health of those participating in sport at any level and keep up with the multifaceted technical nature of cheating in sport to ensure that the uk remains at the forefront of the fight against doping. the dcc has collaborated with key actors in the anti\-doping world, ensuring that cutting edge science remains effectively employed in practice and policy. 

#  shaping world class testing 

 as the only testing centre accredited by wada in the uk, the dcc has, since 1978, provided robust and trusted analytical services. due to the high quality of work and their impact on standing in the anti\-doping community, the total number of samples collected and analysed by the dcc continues to rise year on year. in 2015, the dcc analysed 8,800 samples, whilst in 2018 this number had increased to 12,587 samples, demonstrating that professional sports bodies are increasingly acknowledging the importance of testing athletes as a deterrent to the use of performance enhancing drugs. using the accredited laboratories at king’s as an advanced and trusted testing site, dcc research has impacted the shape and trajectory of testing in the uk. 

 king’s researchers have a proven track record in hgh research \[2,3,4\]. working closely with wada the dcc team developed a new methodological approach to test for hgh, the human growth hormone \(hgh\) biomarkers test. this test was incorporated into guidelines published by wada in 2015 for all anti\-doping laboratories through across the world \[a\]. these guidelines provide the regulatory documents, implementation processes and monitoring procedures to ensure that tests are carried out systematically and that a harmonised approach is taken across all test centres. as the senior deputy director of the science and medicine department at wada acknowledges, “the research output of the dcc was pivotal in the establishment of legally defensible biomarker scores and the implementation of the wada guidelines \- human growth hormone \(hgh\) biomarkers test in 2015” \[b\]. \[text removed for publication\] 

 appropriate long\-term storage and further analysis of archived samples collected from athletes has emerged as an important factor in the protection of clean sport. under the world anti\-doping code, samples can be stored for up to 10 years after their initial analysis and still retain the same legal impact if analysed further retrospectively. taking advantage of dcc research to improve techniques and detect novel compounds, king’s researchers have been able to conduct enhanced retrospective analysis on over 100 samples, with more planned. 

#  shaping practice and policy in uk anti\-doping \(ukad\) 

 ukad, as the organisation responsible for protecting sport in the uk from doping, works towards ‘protecting the right to participate in clean sport’. the dcc is the predominant laboratory used by ukad for the analysis of athlete samples with the aim of catching those in sport who cheat. 

 in 2018, the department for digital, culture, media and sport published a ‘tailored review of ukad’ \[d\] which contained an assessment of current services along with 45 recommendations for the future. the report highlighted the close partnership between the ukad and the dcc, stating the king’s centre as the “most impressive example and contributes to the uk’s international standing in sport and anti\-doping” \[d\]. the report recommended a 50% increase in testing across sport, and in january 2018, the uk government gave uk anti\-doping a £6 million funding boost to educate athletes, share intelligence and conduct testing in the fight against drug cheats to keep sport clean \[e\]. as a result, the number of samples analysed by the dcc has increased to nearly 13,000 in 2019. \[text removed for publication\]. 

#  shaping antidoping testing at key events 

 the dcc has provided the analytical science to ensure that high class anti\-doping is provided at the world’s premier sporting events to maintain fairness and safety. after successfully supporting testing at the london 2012 olympic games the dcc team have gone on to support the development of policy, practice and process in a variety of settings. 

 for example, king’s research has ensured that major games now use techniques from mass spectrometry, detecting peptide and growth hormones more effectively. former director of the brazilian doping control laboratory noted that “the breakthrough of growth hormone exogenous administration detection for the first time in 2012, showed the athletic community that the era of protein doping was due to be over” \[g\]. as a result, more compounds were tested at the 2016 rio games than any other previous games ensuring that the health of the athletes and tests conducted are of the highest ethical standard, giving confidence to individual athletes that major competitions are as fair as possible. 

 by providing communication skills, laboratory organisation, procurement processes, training of personnel and volunteers, researcher exchanges and advanced training the dcc significantly impacted on the preparations and processes during the games. as the former director of the brazilian doping control laboratory stated “this sizeable contribution of professor cowan, the dcc and king´s college london surely had an impact on the quality of the doping control analysis performed at the rio 2016 games” \[g\]. the independent observer for the rio 2016 olympic laboratory report stated “the laboratory was superbly equipped, operated very securely and generally very efficiently, and now represents an outstanding legacy from the games for the anti\-doping movement in south america” \[m\]. 

 in addition, the king’s team impacted on the preparations for the pyeongchang winter olympic games 2018. as stated by the former head of the south korean wada laboratory at the korea institute of science and technology in seoul, the dcc were “key in helping us to fulfil our work to the international standard required… for the preparation of 2018 games, i have made the contract with \[dcc\] for solution of wada isl requirements in staff, facility, security and scientific methods. they were involved in training our staffs, designing document systems for traceability of overall process of sample analysis, preparing wada site visits, and defending wada reports requested after the result of the site visit… \[the dcc\] was the best supporter to us in advising and suggesting the technical solutions of the sample analysis for its successful achievement” \[h\]. 

#  investigating doping violations \- russia 

 following a 2014 german tv documentary which contained allegations of widespread doping in russia, wada established an independent commission \(ic\) to conduct an investigation into the allegedly corrupt practices around sample collection and results management that implicated athletes, coaches, trainers, and doctors, as well as the accredited laboratory based in moscow and the russian anti\-doping agency \(rusada\) in doping violations. as one of the most important events in the world\-wide anti\-doping community for many years, the wada president appointed professor richard mclaren to lead the ic, with findings reported in 2015 and 2016 \[i\]. 

 king’s researchers contributed significantly to the ic, utilising new research and techniques to provide validated methodologies which could detect sample manipulation with salt \[j\], and urine swapping through dna analysis \[7\]. prof mclaren turned to the dcc since they either “had in their repertoire of analytical methods or rapidly developed methods that provided me with legally defensible evidence that samples had been manipulated as claimed by dr rodchenkov. this greatly assisted me in proving the involvement of individuals who could then be identified in my formal and public reports” \[k\]. 

 the ic ultimately proved systematic cheating and a universal ban was placed on russian athletes participating in worldwide sporting events such as rio 2016 olympics and paralympics \[l\] as well as the wada accreditation of the moscow laboratory being revoked. as noted by prof mclaren “without the assistance of the drug control centre, my investigation would at best have been delayed and possibly may not have been able to reach the clear conclusions as published… i am very indebted to the dcc for the very significant contributions they made to my work” \[k\]. 

 these events had a huge impact on international sport, demonstrating to the world that the fight against doping is being taken incredibly seriously, and those who seek to subvert the system, no matter how powerful, will be heavily sanctioned. as a result, large organisations such as wada and the international olympic committee have reiterated their critical commitment to the maintenance of fairness in competition, where king’s researchers continue to play a key role.

1.  **summary of the impact** 

 mcgeachan’s research into a unique ‘arts and mental health’ collection, *art extraordinary* \(ae\), fostered a new model of academic\-museum curatorial practice, enacted and evaluated across glasgow since 2015 in partnership with glasgow museums \(gm\) and gm’s open museums \(om\). this work produced innovative community co\-curation of ae in public exhibitions, with evidence showing a direct increase in the skills, confidence and empowerment of 290 participants from mental health and community groups. two impact legacies emerge: \(1\) mcgeachan’s successful model of academic\-museum curatorial practice levered new gm\-om investment in an ‘art outside the box’ handling kit, to reach an estimated 25,000 people annually, institutionalising the benefits of the partnership work; \(2\) mcgeachan’s research and model of partnership working secured a new gm commitment to allocate *permanent* exhibition space representing ae and mental ill\-health in the flagship kelvingrove museum, which receives an estimated 1.3 million visits annually. together, these impacts have changed gm’s engagement with mental\-ill health. 
","
 **2. underpinning research** 

 since 2012, funded by the wellcome trust and the british academy, mcgeachan has been leading research into the historical geographies of mental ill\-health using archival sources and museum collections. as part of a broader programme emphasising the ‘humanity’ of those enduring mental ill\-health, and the possibilities for creating spaces of care\-and\-compassion even in the heart of ‘closed’ institutional worlds \( **references** **3.1**, **3.2**\), she has explored the role that artworks – viewing, engaging and making art – can play in fostering such spaces. her approach is at once that of painstaking archival scholar and engaged *animateur* of practices, events and impacts beyond the academy. 

 mcgeachan’s specific research here opens up and demonstrates the significance of *art extraordinary* \(ae\), a unique collection of scottish ‘outsider art’ collected by art therapist joyce laing during the period 1970−2000s and donated to glasgow museums \(gm\) in 2012. the collection consists of 1,134 pieces from various dates c.1880−2007, encompassing a diverse set of artworks made by people with no formal art education and who often lived on the margins of society, including in mental health institutions and prisons. mcgeachan’s research began with the overall ae collection, recovering the motivations, practices and geographical reach of laing herself, as well as clarifying the ‘provenance’ histories of many artists and artworks. next, she dived more deeply into the details of 9 artists from the collection \(responsible for 705 pieces in the collection\) tracing them through in\-depth archival inquiry. the upshot was to produce rich ‘geographical biographies’ of objects, places, materials, practices and people associated with ae \( **3.3**, **3.6**\), furnishing *the* foundational treatment of this collection to inform and encourage future researchers and expand the category of, and approaches to, ‘outsider art’. 

 the results from mcgeachan’s ‘geographical biographies’ are twofold: **\(1\)** they reveal for the first time *where* the artwork was made, *how* it was produced and *who* had been involved in its making; and **\(2\)** they trace the explicit connection between the lived experiences of mental ill\-health of the artists and their creative practices. particular artist\-patients are drawn out of obscurity, such as adam christie, the ‘head carver’ or clandestine stone\-sculptor of montrose asylum \( **3.4**\), while a spin\-off project illuminates the lived dynamics of confinement in the otherwise highly ‘sealed\-off’ environment of barlinnie prison, specifically the now\-closed barlinnie special unit \(bsu\) \( **3.5**\). 

 mcgeachan worked collaboratively with gm staff to deploy her intensive research on ae, devising research\-led catalogue information and creating future plans for working with ae, specifically with glasgow’s open museum \(om\), a branch of gm. her research findings were thereby used as the basis for a new collaboration between the university of glasgow \(uofg\) and glasgow’s museum sector. gm collections are internationally renowned and comprise the largest museum service in the uk outside of london, with over 3.8 million visitors to its 9 venues in 2018−19 \( **5.4**\). gm maintains a philosophical commitment to promoting the museum as a civic space that values diverse community engagements; om augments this commitment by taking museum collections outside of the museum walls to generate new creative opportunities for active public participation. this research collaboration led by mcgeachan has directly influenced how gm delivers this commitment by using the ae collection to rectify relative ignorance of scottish ‘outsider art’, and to change the ways in which gm, via om, engages people with mental ill\-health in their work programmes and cultural venues.

 **4. details of the impact** 

 experiences of mental ill\-health have previously been under\-represented in the work of gm \( **source** **5.3**\), their only previous mental health exhibition being removed from kelvingrove museum in 2012. mcgeachan’s research impact remedies this situation, most *directly* through the co\-development \(with om\) of: **5 one\-day exhibitions** of ae across 4 years \(2015−2019\) for the scottish mental health arts and film festival \(smhaff\), a **one\-week** specialist exhibition in barlinnie prison, a **six\-month** exhibition in kelvingrove, and a **one\-year** exhibition in pollok civic realm \(pcr\), a gm exhibition venue; **18 specialist** **curator tours** of ae in storage at gm; and a **12\-month community programme of arts\-based events** inspired by ae at pcr. the research\-led curation of ae also reached 800 prisoners via the barlinnie prison exhibition. circa 50−70 visitors attended each smhaff event, with 3,500\+ visitors to the pcr exhibition and community programme. beyond this extensive ‘outreach’ to varied publics, **two key impacts** have arisen: 

 **\(1\) changes to collaborative museum\-academic practice, leading to a permanent cultural mental health legacy and a sustainable model for future practice:** a key concern for gm/om when operating with previous academic partners was limited meaningful collaboration and minimal follow\-through engagement with community partners \( **5.5**, **head nurse in recreational therapy, leverndale hospital**, 2019\). through partnership with mcgeachan, a new *model of meaningful collaboration* and *co\-curation* has been nurtured between the university, museum and mental health, prison and other communities: *“we seek to use this model of collaboration for future projects”* \( **5.3**, **om manager**, 2020\). interest in this ‘ground\-breaking’ model of collaboration has been shown by other museums in london, sweden and belgium, and it has been invited as a case study of good practice for the international edited volume *cultural heritage for wellbeing: inspiring cases that create positive change in wellbeing with heritage collections*, a professional museum publication \( **5.1**\). the model of collaboration resulted in the exhibitions listed above: 

 *“the exchange of knowledge and skills between us has benefited the delivery of a community co\-curated project at pollok civic realm in 2018*− *2019 ... this has enhanced inclusion and representation of mental health and community knowledge on the subjects of mental health and creativity ...”* \( **5.2**, **curator of scottish history, glasgow life**, 2020\). 

 *“working with dr cheryl mcgeachan has enabled the collection to reach new audiences … this project enabled people with lived experience of mental \(ill\) health to collaboratively research and exhibit objects in our collection. our collaboration facilitated an approach which gave agency to people whose voices are either under\-represented or spoken ‘for’ in museum and academic establishments …”* \( **5.2**, **om curator**, 2020 **\)** 

 *“the team collaborating on this project developed a dynamic, socially engaged project* 

 *..., which not only allowed the general public to benefit from this collection, but also two very distinct marginalised social groups: people incarcerated in prison and those struggling with mental health conditions … the value of this project cannot be understated.”* \( **5.2**, **outsider art expert**, edinburgh college of art, 2020\) 

 this collaborative model and its outcomes received external recognition in the uk ‘arts in criminal justice’ *koestler bronze award*, 2017, was shortlisted for best collaboration \(arts & culture\) at the *university of glasgow knowledge exchange and public engagement awards*, 2019, and has been nominated for a *museums change lives institutional award*, 2020 \( **5.6**\). 

 **direct change to gm exhibition space \(permanent\):** the research\-led collaboration detailed above became one of the om’s *“largest scale endeavors”* \( **5.1**\), significantly changing the representation of, and engagement with, mental ill\-health across gm. the successful cultural outcomes here were critical to the senior management of gm approving a permanent ae display at kelvingrove museum \(installed 2021 due to covid\-19 delays\), specifying the use of the model of collaboration developed in the ‘ae project’ \( **5.3**\): 

 *“having been accessioned in 2012 the \[ae\] collection is finally recognised in the service’s foremost venue in 2020. without dr mcgeachan’s academic work …  this may well not have happened.”* \( **5.2**, **curator of scottish history, glasgow life**, 2020\). 

 **\(2\) community engagement with **art extraordinary** benefiting the well\-being and skillsets of diverse community participants:** a total of 290 people participated across the ae community engagement programme, including individuals in prison, psychiatric care and mental health community services: ie. those from some of the most marginalised and discriminated\-against groups in uk society. not all participants could or were allowed to complete formal evaluations by their professional care staff, but a proportion offered verbal comments \( **5.5**\). *all* the cultural outcomes discussed here were co\-developed and co\-curated *with* community partners. 

 research\-led ‘stories’ of the ae artists were shared with community participants, who were then supported and enabled to select over 60 related objects for display in multiple exhibitions and for use in a dedicated gm handling kit \(see below\). participants wrote over 40 exhibition labels, designed 7 exhibition panels and devised 6 exhibition guides and postcards \(see illustrations\) \( **5.8**\), ensuring that the voices and expertise of participants became intimately woven into gm’s curatorial practice. these cultural projects were designed to train participants *themselves* to become curators of the ae collection, developing new skills, enhancing senses of individual and collective achievement, and offering learning opportunities for groups not usually engaged with museums. 

 **new skills:** participants and professional staff have identified direct cultural and skills outcomes: 

 **participants:** *“it really feels amazing \[to be a curator\], it really feels like a big achievement ... i suppose i have a little bit of an insight into how thing go together, how to position things ... i feel like i’ve got a little bit of an insight. it’s been really interesting learning what goes into that and i feel really proud that we have been able to have it up for the year \[at pcr\] and it’s been really special.”* \( **5.5**, **participant**, 2019\) 

 *“i think i’ve got a much stronger ability to interpret things and to be able to put into words, writing and interpretation – that was something i found interesting.”* \( **5.5**, **participant,** 2019\) 

 **professional:** *“\[it enabled us to\] highlight some patients who are acutely unwell to introduce them to outsider art and also give them the opportunity, i guess, to go somewhere where they possibly have never been before, to see things that they never have that chance living in the community. so it was … was a great experience for myself and the patients.”* \( **5.5**, **patient activity coordinator, leverndale hospital**, 2019\) 

 in barlinnie prison, 15 participant prisoners gained their *scottish qualification authority* qualifications in ‘communications’, demonstrating presentation skills through engaging their peers via object\-handling in connection with project workshops. the resultant exhibition event was attended by the **head of education for scottish prisons**, who indicated *“that the type of work being undertaken in this project, particularly its innovative collaborative nature, was a model of good practice for other prisons working with the arts”* \( **5.2**\). 12 project participants acted as tour guides for the 800 prison exhibition visitors, leading a total of 40 facilitated tours of the exhibition, relating expert knowledge about the collection and further practising presentation skills: 

 **professional:** *“this has been an exciting opportunity to get students \[prisoners\] to carry out original research on a part of barlinnie’s social history, whilst also gaining qualifications and improving their confidence.”* \( **5.2**, **head of education barlinnie prison**, 2017\) 

 **building senses of inclusion through arts practice:** the ‘stories’ used in the projects enabled participants to connect their lived experiences with the ae artists and artworks. professionals supporting participants harnessed the value of the work, and it changed senses of inclusion and identification for patients: 

 **professionals:** *“i think the stories behind a lot of the art inspired a lot of the patients … to actually be able to do some art … i think something’s changed for the better, i mean we’ve made these links, these connections … it has changed for the positive.”* \( **5.5**, **patient activity coordinator, leverndale hospital**, 2019\) 

 *“our patients can relate to the objects because they potentially may have been in their life suffering as some of these artists may have been … working with our colleague from glasgow university to find out a bit more about each and every artist … that gives them a bit of hope that they could potentially produce something … that could in the future be in kelvingrove \[in the permanent exhibition\].”* **\(5.5**, **recreational therapy nurse,** **leverndale hospital**, 2019\) 

 **confidence and empowerment:** a key aspect to the design of the projects was to encourage confidence and inspire empowerment through the displaying of participants’ work in exhibitions and recounting of it in text: 

 **participants:** *“on a specific level, i do feel that i have a bit more confidence in my own work and what i feel comes under art. prior to getting involved i was always very sceptical of my own work … i’ve got a new found confidence in looking at other people’s work and being able to see other than just the surface.”* \( **5.5**, **participant**, 2019\) 

 *“i’m a bit more confident as\-well with the work being up and people reading it and i can go home and think about what do people think about my work and what do the words that i’ve put to someone else’s work mean.”* \( **5.5**, **participant**, 2019\) 

 **professional:** *“i know she feels more confident about doing more sketching and drawing and she’s been doing murals for wards and i think it’s just being connected that has been inspiring for her … it connects in a way that kicks off another stage to your personal development …”* \( **5.5**, **head nurse in recreational therapy, leverndale hospital**, 2019\) 

 **research impact legacy:** leading tangibly from these enhancements of participant skills, senses of inclusion and growing confidence, and from the deepened sense of what makes for successful community engagement, the following impact legacies can be detected: 

 **direct individual impacts:** at least 13 participants created their own new artworks inspired by their work with ae, including textiles, painting, drawing and sculpture. a month\-long exhibition at partner project project ability, entitled ‘extraordinary responses’, featured 6 participants who took displaying over 25 pieces of their own original artwork. these impacts have been long\-lasting and demonstrate success in building participants’ sense of their own agency and expertise: indeed, as 

 
a direct result of participation, *“some of the group have gone on to form aarg \[autistic artists research group\] and will be undertaking an autism audit of glasgow museums; responding to the museum estate and the collections’* \( **5.2**, **director of project ability**, 2020\). furthermore, one participant drafted and compiled 2 edited writing collections, another has written a blog, and prisoners have written 4 poems prompted by the bsu \( **5.7**\). participants described the process here as ‘ *a fantastic journey’  \( **5.5**\). 

  

 **permanent cultural impacts for glasgow communities:** these benefits have been recognised at gm, who have invested a budget and staffing resources to fund the co\-curation of a research\-led ae handling kit called ‘art outside the box’, designed as a permanent community resource. this handling kit will be on permanent loan from 2021. in 2018−2019, over 18,725 community members engaged with the om’s handling kits \( **5.4**\). the research has thus directly influenced gm’s service priorities and investments, building on the benefits of community engagement with the ae collection and formulating a generalisable model of practice that will continue positively to impact various publics: *“the permanent resources created in both kelvingrove and through the handling kit create a strong legacy of the unique collaboration and are an asset to glasgow life's cultural infrastructure as they represent a range of the city's underrepresented voices”* \( **5.2**, **om manager**, 2020\). 

 **covid\-19 effects:** the pandemic led to the delay of the agreed installation of the ae exhibition in kelvingrove museum \( **5.3**\) until 2021. due to the inability to pilot the handling kit with community groups, a postal pack based on the kit was devised by all project partners. 250 packs were created and used by individuals connected to psychiatric \(30\) and community mental health services \(60\) and prisons \(120\) across scotland \( **5.8**\). packs were designed to extend the reach of the collaborative work while the handling kit was unavailable, and also to support vulnerable communities through the arts during the pandemic.

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 rees centre research on children looked after \(cla\) in 2015 identified factors contributing to poor educational outcomes of those supported by children’s services in the uk. the department for education \(dfe\) changed their annual statistical release on outcomes for cla in 2016 in response to the rees centre’s cla research recommendations. a year later, ofsted’s inspection framework for schools, and social care inspections, extended their focus on cla and introduced education inspectors on social care inspections and vice versa. informed by the centre’s research, some local authorities \(las\), including barking and dagenham, salford, staffordshire and suffolk, changed their policies on cla moving schools and increased resources to pupil referral units. internationally, australia’s largest fostering provider also changed its policies and practice in 2017 informed by this research. 
","
###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 the rees centre in the department of education, university of oxford, conducts research that aims to improve the education, well\-being and life outcomes of those who are, or have been, supported by children’s social care services. the oxford\-led “the educational progress of looked after children in england: linking care and educational data” study **\[r1\]** \(in collaboration with university of bristol\) was the first research to link education and care factors statistically and complement this with interviews of secondary\-aged cla in england. oxford\-led on the quantitative analysis of dfe datasets on cla and the national pupil database \(npd\) \(luke, strand, fletcher\) and contributed to the qualitative interviews that complemented this work \(sebba, foster carers and care leaver interviews\). the main findings and associated recommendations that underpinned impact were published in november 2015 and in a series of papers **\[r2, r3, r4, r5, r6\]**. recommendations included: 

 **f1** children in longer\-term care do better than those ‘in need’ \(children with a social worker but not in care\), or those in short term care. children in need provide an additional, and more suitable, comparison group than the general child population for children in care in official statistics and public debate **\[r6\].** 

 **f2** some young people in care with lower prior attainment subsequently made very good progress academically. a focus on progress, rather than attainment only, gives a more realistic depiction of the achievements of cla **\[r6\]**. 

 **f3** each change of care placement age 11\+ is associated with one\-third of a grade less at gcse, and young people in care who changed school in years 10 or 11 scored over five grades less than those who did not. local authorities should ensure that school staff provide appropriate support \(partly through the virtual school who has responsibility for the progress of cla\), and limit placement and school changes, in ks4 **\[r5\]**. 

 **f4** cla’s unauthorised absences and fixed\-term exclusions are associated with poorer gcses. initiatives to support pupils with social, emotional and mental health difficulties need to become more widely implemented to address the attendance and exclusions of cla **\[r1\].** 

 **f5** young people in special schools or pupil referral units \(prus\) at 16 scored 14 grades lower in gcses compared to those with the same characteristics in mainstream schools. local authorities should admit cla to high performing mainstream schools \[the report implied rather than stated that there should be a preference for mainstream\] where possible and better equip special schools/prus to support cla’s progress **\[r1\]**. 

 **f6** children whose final placement was in foster or kinship care scored six gcse grades better than those in residential care. local authorities should prioritise foster/kinship placements and address educational improvement across the workforce in residential settings **\[r1\]**.

###  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 the findings and recommendations were disseminated through distribution of over 3,000 copies of the report **\[r1\]** to policy makers, local authorities \(las\), children’s services managers and practitioners, and internationally \(in particular in japan and australia\). multiple face\-to\-face briefings were given to dfe senior officials and the association of directors of children’s services \(adcs\), and workshop sessions were held in 2016 with over 1,500 ofsted inspectors and over 100 virtual school heads \(vsh, 120 in total in england tasked with enhancing/supporting the education of cla\) across the nine local government regions. impact from the research won 1st prize in the university of bristol vice chancellor’s impact award november 2016 and was highly commended in the excellence in impact awards, university of oxford, 2018. 

###  impact on national policy 

 changes were made to the dfe statistical first release of outcomes of cla, published march 2016, which for the first time compared cla to children in need in response to **f1 in r1 \[s2, pp.4\-9\]** and increased the reporting of progress in line with the report’s recommendations **\[r1\]**. the then government children’s minister urged every la to implement the recommendations: 

 ‘*…this research* **\[r1\]** *helps us in thinking about how we can make progress…: dfe officials have already* …\[started\] *exploring how we can use data better to help us drive and measure the attainment of children in care in the future, and identify collective action that will promote their achievements at school. …it may be more useful to use the progress of looked\-after children, relative to those with the same prior attainment* **\[f1, which led to s2\]** *, as a measure of the effectiveness of care rather than solely using absolute attainment’* **\[s1\]**. 

 parliament debated the report **\[r1\]** findings in january 2016. giving preference to foster care over residential care because of the better associated educational outcomes **\[r1\]** was raised by the education select committee in a debate on cla in the commons. alan johnson cited the report in his arguments on the need to give preference to foster care: ‘… *the latest piece of research, from last november, states that those children* \[in kinship/foster care\] *also do better in educational attainment than those in residential care’* **\[f6\]**, **\[s3a\]**. 

 reducing school changes was highlighted in the education select committee fostering inquiry, to which sebba gave oral evidence in april 2017 **\[s3b, q157\-167\]**. the inquiry report references the research and the subsequent debate on the inquiry stated: *‘research on the educational progress of looked\-after children has found that educational placement changes are a significant risk factor  \[f3\]  for the educational outcomes for children in care…* **’ \[s3c\]**. in response to this report, the government stressed the importance of stability for cla: *the number of moves of placement, social worker or school must be kept to an absolute minimum’* **\[s3d, p.21\]**. 

 a commitment not to place children far from home and to review the education of children in need was made in the 2017 conservative party manifesto in which two references are made to the findings \(while not mentioning the research explicitly, **r1** was the only research on these two issues at that time\): ‘ *we will ensure that councils provide consistency of care  \[f3\]  and cannot relocate vulnerable children far from their home when it is not in their best interests to do so. we will review support for children in need* **\[f1\]** *to understand why their outcomes are so poor and what more support they might require, in and out of school*.’ **\[s4, p.73\]**. the conservative party review team met with the research team five times \(a small invited workshop, an online seminar and three briefings, as well as numerous email exchanges\), and published its report in june 2019 **\[s4, p.8\]** which, it stated: *‘…take*\[s\] *account of academic evidence and research, including…joint work with the university of oxford’s rees centre* **\[r5, r6\]** *’.* in 2020, this led to a proposal by the dfe in its 2019 children in need review, which cites **r1** as key to its research underpinning in its introduction, that virtual schools take responsibility for supporting the education of children in need **\[s5, pp.8 & 37\]**. 

  

###  impact on ofsted inspection 

 changes to the ofsted inspection framework guidance for children’s services \(published in 2017, amended in 2019 and 2020\) **\[s7a\]** were made that reflected the research recommendations **\[r1, r2, r3\]**. the 2016 chief inspector’s annual report on children’s social care **\[s6, pp. 8 & 53\],** had referenced the research, noting the specific findings on children doing better in care than in need, the use of the latter as a comparator **\[f1\]** and the high proportion not in mainstream schools and thereby at risk of poorer outcomes **\[f5\]**. the ofsted national director for social care published a blog summarising ofsted’s changing approach in response to the research **\[s7c\]**, while the lead ofsted manager for children in care commented **\[s7b\]**: *‘we have taken the research findings into careful account during the development of our new frameworks for inspections of local authority children’s services \(ilacs\) and regulated services under the* *sccif* *\(social care common inspection framework\). …an educational inspector alongside social care colleagues during local authority inspections* **\[introduced in response to overall findings, s7a\]** *will help us to look more closely and accurately at educational progress children make and how this is affected by their care* **\[f1\]** *.* *…the criteria and methodology … place a greater emphasis on evaluating the educational progress of individual children from their starting points* **\[f1\]** *and less on the overall gap between the children in care cohort and their peers. the framework’s strong emphasis on the importance of good decision\-making and achievement of timely permanence reflect the* \[research\] *findings related to the age of entry into care and overall stability for children…* **\[f3\]’** 

###  national bodies and local authorities 

 a new national dataset **\[s9\]** for las to better monitor the progress of looked after children **\[f1, f2\]**, linking education and social care data has led to improved decision\-making and potentially improved educational outcomes for cla \(a causal link cannot be proved\). this was commissioned in late 2015 by the adcs and national association of vshs \(navsh\). their published response stated **\[s8\]**: *‘building on evidence from recent research carried out by the rees centre at the university of oxford and the university of bristol* **\[r1\]** *, …adcs working with the virtual school heads network and the national consortium for examination results* \[ncer\] *, wants to stimulate a national debate about improving support and ambition for children in care, and, through that, to improve educational outcomes and life chances for all children in care.’* 

 three actions were proposed: developing a new dataset to help las **\[s9\]**, informing the new ofsted framework **\[s7a\]** and challenging national policy so las can ensure that cla have access to the best educational placements \[f3, f5, s12\]**. from april 2019 to march 2020, 30,769 reports were run using the dataset by 150 \(all but two\) las. in 2020, suffolk vsh stated **\[s10a\]**: ‘ *the ncer dataset and toolkit has helped us to understand the specific context of cla outcomes …through monitoring much more robustly what is actually happening. this has informed important decisions about priorities in allocation of scarce resources. analysis of our results compared to national data, identified three problems: poor performance of cla with special educational needs and disabilities, high scores \(indicators of high levels of behaviour problems\) on the strengths and difficulties questionnaire \(sdq, collected nationally\) correlating with poor outcomes, and too many cla leaving school without qualifications. we targeted better support in each of these areas and have been able to monitor the following: an increase in cla who gain any qualification, though cannot claim causation due to small cohorts; the capture and sharing of best practice where schools are achieving good outcomes for children with concerning sdq scores; and better progress in children identified as having send support than non\-looked after children in suffolk schools.’* 

 minimising school moves in line with the research recommendations **\[r1\]** has been reported by individual las. for example, the vsh in staffordshire stated: ‘ *the social worker requested for pupil to move to school closer to his current placement…pupil’s current school is 20\-minute drive from the foster placement, he is making excellent progress at his current school... research* **\[r1\]** *clearly evidences the impact of school moves upon a child’s educational progress and attainment* **\[f3\] **,** there is a commitment \[now\] to minimising school moves. decision: a school move is not agreed…’* **\[s10b\]**. 

 decisions about budget allocations, managed moves and exclusions **\[f3, f4\]** have been influenced by the research in other las. for example, the vsh in salford stated: ‘ *…in allocating the 2016\-17 centrally retained ppp budget of c.£350,000 we have given greater priority to the 'segregated’ 40%. the report brought home the need to devote even further energy and resources to those in children's homes* **\[f6\],** *in non\-mainstream schools* **\[f5\]…** *we continue to challenge managed moves* **\[f3\]** *and fixed term exclusions* **\[f4\]** *but with greater vigour’* **\[s10d\]** a virtual school advisory teacher, barking and dagenham reported: ‘ *i have used the report …to inform social workers and iros* \[independent reviewing officers\] *about the importance of keeping a lac* \[looked after child\] *in the same school* **\[f3\]** *when placement move becomes an issue. also, findings have informed …lac at risk of exclusion* **\[f4\].** *in particular,* \[the finding that\] *mainstream schools reporting higher gcse results compared with those lac who were educated in alternative provision* **\[f5\]** *… provides evidence to encourage mainstream schools to keep the excluded lac at the school with a support package.…research has been helpful in working out how best to use the pupil premium grant* **\[relevant findings reported in r5\]**.’ **\[s10c\]** 

###  international impact: australia 

 extending the research into an international context, sebba gave a keynote speech in 2016, which drew heavily on **r1**, at the association of child welfare agencies annual conference. following this she had meetings with a number of officials including the new south wales minister for family and community services, the association of child welfare agencies and life without barriers, a major fostering provider for 3000 young people, reviewed their education policies for children in out\-of\-home care in 2017\-18. the director of life without barriers, who commissioned sebba to run workshops for staff, stated **\[s11\]**: ‘ *research on the educational progress* **\[r2, r4\]** *influenced our work as we re\-designed our foster care approach... in particular the findings related to time in care \(that care is a protective factor in education\)* **\[f1\]** *and school absence* **\[f4\]** *.’* sebba also briefed south australia’s minister for child protection and her delegation in may 2019 in london, which has been used in their evolving policy for out\-of\-home care.

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 research conducted by prof stephen holland at the university of york underpinned the guiding principles and operating procedures of public health england’s \(phe\) first research ethics committee. phe’s research ethics and governance group \(regg\) met for the first time in 2015, chaired by holland. prior to this, phe did not have a body dedicated to the ethical oversight of its research activities. regg thus changed phe’s information\-gathering activities, including both public health research and non\-research public health practice. in doing so, regg transformed phe’s informational culture, requiring phe staff to consider regg review at the outset of their project planning, leading to a noticeable upskilling of staff in this area. in turn, this has impacted on wider society: regg strictures protect participants from research related risks and harms, and change their experience of participating in phe’s information\-gathering activities; and regg has enabled and supported phe’s response to the current covid crisis. 
","
###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 the underpinning research is holland’s body of work in public health ethics and research ethics. regarding public health ethics, **\[3.1\]** applies moral and political theory to public health dilemmas, and has been recognised internationally as a major contribution to the field since its first edition in 2007; **\[3.2\]** clarifies, and evaluates responses to, the central problem of liberty\-limiting state intervention for public health purposes, and **\[3.3\]** analyses one such approach in depth, namely, ‘nudges’ to resolve public health dilemmas. regarding research ethics, holland has published on the role and remit of research ethics committees – including whether this should extend to judging the scientific merits of research studies **\[3.4\]** – and analysed the ethics of the national institute for health and care excellence \(nice’s\) restricting access to new health treatments and technologies by attaching research conditions **\[3.5\]**. 

 holland’s tenure as chair of regg coincided with research culminating in **\[3.6\]**. as a result, regg’s guiding principles and operating procedures were entirely informed by research findings published in the book, as explicitly stated in the preface: “the research undertaken for this book has directly informed the work of regg” \[3.6, p. ix\]. the book presents the following ‘master argument’: conceptually speaking, the book argues that the distinction between research and other information\-gathering practices is defensible by appeal to wittgenstein’s ‘family resemblance concepts’. despite this conceptual distinction, research exceptionalism – i.e., the view that research is distinct from other information\-gathering activities, in ways that justify particularly close scrutiny of the former – is false. this anti\-exceptionalism about research implies that non\-research information\-gathering practices should be in the remit of research ethics committees, which threatens to inflate information governance beyond practicability. but such ‘regulation inflation’ is avoidable in two ways: first, by establishing that research is already overregulated; second, by devising measures such as ethical risk screening and proportionate review. regarding the former, the claim that research is overregulated – which is persistently misconstrued in the literature – is clarified before being defended from objections.  regarding the latter, scepticism about proportionate review is met with evidence of effective systems of ethical risk screening aimed precisely at public health information gathering. 

 throughout this body of work, holland has consistently argued that public health data collection raises issues distinct from general research ethics \[3.1\]. standard research axioms don’t apply: e.g., individual voluntary informed consent to participate is impossible in public health contexts. the risks from public health data collection are also distinctive – e.g., stigmatising disadvantaged social groups is more of a potential hazard than direct physical or mental harm to individuals – as are the benefits, e.g., reduced health inequalities. so, the way public health information gathering is ethically evaluated has to differ from traditional research ethics models. for example, the requirements on participant recruitment – including how participants are informed of, and consent to, studies – are different, as are the sorts of cost, benefits, and burdens of public health information gathering, and how to make appropriate trade\-offs between individual privacy rights and mandatory data collection. this distinctive approach to public health data collection directly informed the way regg operates: not as a standard ethics committee, but tailored to phe’s remit – i.e., public health information\-gathering – in ways detailed below.

###  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 holland's research, by informing the guiding principles of regg, public health england's first research ethics committee, has changed practice and organisational culture at phe, strengthened protection of large numbers of study participants, and contributed to phe's response to the covid\-19 outbreak. 

 **overview.** phe is the executive agency of the department of health responsible for protecting and improving the nation's health and wellbeing, and reducing health inequalities. to fulfil this remit, phe undertakes and sponsors a considerable amount of research. prior to 2015, phe research did not undergo ethical review because, being public health oriented, it fell outside the remit of the nhs health research authority \(hra\). but, as holland has argued \[3.1, 3.6\], this research can be as ethically risky and potentially harmful as studies which do require standard research ethics approval \(by the nhs hra or an equivalent research governance body\). in response, in 2015 phe approached holland, on the basis of his expertise in public health research ethics, to set up its first bespoke research ethics committee, the research ethics and governance group \(regg\). holland served in that role from 2015\-19, during which regg put into practice an approach to the ethics and governance of public health information underpinned by holland’s research. 

####  4.1 how the research underpinned the impact: establishing the guiding principles for the ethical oversight of phe’s information gathering activities 

 phe identified holland to chair regg “through his publications \[and\] research interests … \[in particular\] stephen’s 2014 book ‘ *public health ethics*’ \(2nd edition\) provided a solid foundation to add value to phe” \[5.1\]. regg’s guiding principles and operating procedures were underpinned by holland’s research insights. as outlined in section 2 above, holland has consistently argued that public health information requires a different sort of scrutiny to standard research ethics review. it was on this basis that phe agreed to start regg from scratch, including devising entirely new guiding principles and operating procedures \[5.2\]. 

 these principles and procedures were founded on holland’s research. to refer back to the ‘master argument’ in section 2, holland’s anti\-exceptionalism \[3.6\] was the basis for expanding regg’s remit to include phe information\-gathering activities, which are routine public health practice, as well as ‘research proper’. such activities include collecting surveillance data and monitoring population health; population screening programmes; service evaluations and quality improvement activities; information gathering in response to public health outbreaks and emergencies; and market research studies. by 2018 over half of the submissions to regg were for such public health practice activities. that the decision to include such non\-research phe practice in regg’s remit was based on holland’s research is confirmed by phe: “in line with stephen’s published insights, the regg differs from \[research ethics committees\] in considering and advising on non\-research public health practice, for example surveillance, service evaluation and market research” \[5.1\]. 

 to refer again to the ‘master argument’ in section 2, holland’s views on the threat of ‘regulation inflation’ was the basis for devising regg documentation. in particular, holland “led discussion” \[5.1\] to devise and develop criteria for regg review of phe’s information\-gathering activities, based on his published views about proportional review, as detailed in section 2 \[3.6\]. the upshot was a triage system of ethics and governance that included all phe information\-gathering activities, whilst avoiding ‘regulation inflation’ beyond practicability, by ensuring that submissions had proportionate review, as confirmed by phe: “with stephen as chairman, the initial tasks were to understand and define the scope of phe’s work relevant to the group, develop terms of reference, *devise proportionate ethics consideration and monitoring processes* and develop supporting documentation for guidance, to receive submissions and to engage with applicants” \[5.1, emphasis added\]. 

####  4.2 examples of impact following from the guiding principles established for regg on the basis of holland’s research 

#####  4.2.1 ethical oversight of market research studies 

 before regg was set up, phe allowed market research companies to collect data in their name without any form of ethical oversight, despite the fact that market research studies “may collate, use and share personal information, including that provided by vulnerable people” \[5.1\]. holland’s research insights into anti\-exceptionalism and proportionate review – as set out in the ‘master argument’ above – were central to regg’s response to this omission: “stephen led discussion to establish and communicate expected standards of ethical practice and how the studies would be reviewed” \[5.1\]. the upshot was an innovative proportionate process for ensuring that market research now has ethical oversight, and meets industry standards of good governance, without overwhelming the committee \[5.3\]. from 2015, regg reviewed and required changes to market research into a wide range of highly sensitive subjects, including a dementia awareness health check, school food standards, alcohol\-related violence, and hiv\-related attitudes and behaviour \[5.4\]. 

#####  4.2.2 embedding of guiding principles of regg into phe’s organisational culture 

 the shift from allowing information\-gathering activities sponsored by phe to proceed without ethics committee scrutiny, to the current system of regg review and approval, required a discernible change in phe’s informational culture. regg’s review of phe projects in line with their guiding principles, and feedback given as a result of review, gradually made phe researchers aware of ethical issues raised by their projects and the requirement to submit for ethical approval: “colleagues developing research and public health practice studies appreciate the regg feedback and increasingly are approaching the regg to confirm study classification \(research or non\-research\) and guide them through regulatory requirements, particularly the changes to data governance and sharing following the introduction of gdpr” \[5.1\]. the embedding of holland’s guiding principles of public health research ethics in the organisational culture of phe is evidenced by, “an increasing percentage of applications approved by the regg on initial review with a decreasing percentage requiring correction and resubmission. this is evidence of the improved quality of submissions” \[5.1\]. 

#####  4.2.3 bringing ethical oversight to a range of information gathering activities affecting large numbers of participants 

 the extent of regg’s impact on phe’s activities is captured in activity data \[5.4\] and illustrated as follows. the total number of applications to regg increased from 10 in 2015, to 37 in 2016, 46 in 2017, and 54 in 2018 \[5.1\]. in addition to these submissions for full regg review, as chair, holland was also instrumental in decisions affecting other information\-gathering activities, including providing advice – informed by his body of research – to the phe’s head of research governance, and taking chair’s action on studies that did not require full review. in so doing, holland drew on his published views on the risks and benefits of public health information gathering, as outlined above \[3.1, 3.6\]. as the numbers grew, so too did the diversity of activities which came under scrutiny. regg reviewed studies into the most pressing public health issues, ranging from the spread of the zika virus and ebola, coastal flooding and health protection, emergency preparedness, and responses to the salisbury novichok poisoning. regg reviewed studies of the most sensitive and delicate kind, including particularly vulnerable participants – such as children, and prison populations – and highly contentious and politicised issues, such as sexual and reproductive health. the studies within regg’s remit involve huge numbers of participants, because public health research and practice require large quantities of data from a big pool of participants; this is one of the main reasons standard principles of research ethics do not apply well in public health \(e.g., there are too many people in public health studies to get individual consent from each of them \[3.1, 3.6\]\). 

 to illustrate the size of projects regg reviewed. \(1\) a sentinel surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance among community acquired urinary tract infections was piloted throughout greater manchester in 2017 \[5.5\]; \(2\) a study to improve the enhanced surveillance of at\-risk infants born to hepatitis b virus \(hbv\) infected mothers in 2018 required venous samples from \~3000/year hbv\-infected mothers \[5.5\]; \(3\) a cross\-sectional study in 2018 administered an electronic health outcome survey to all healthcare practitioners working throughout england \- including general practitioners, medical consultants, and nurses and allied health professionals \- recruited through the royal colleges and member bodies for health care and allied health care professionals \[5.5\]; \(4\) in 2016, when regg reviewed a study aimed at establishing a gp\-based sentinel surveillance network to understand blood borne viruses \(bbv\) in migrants, including refugees and asylum seekers in england, the number of migrants registered with a gp in england for the first time – which was taken as an indication of how many new migrants would be affected by the study – came to 713,000 \[5.5\]. these four examples demonstrate how the total sum of participants involved in studies scrutinised by the regg from 2015 easily numbers in the millions. 

#####  4.2.4 protecting study participants 

 phe studies which fall under regg’s remit \- including both research and non\-research activities, as informed by holland’s research \- involve members of the general public. so, regg review and approval ensures the public’s safety, including minimising or avoiding risks and harms of participating in studies and providing data: “this is demonstrable among phe staff in their improved expertise and confidence in managing ethical dimensions of research and other studies, thus benefitting the safety and well\-being of study participants” \[5.1\]. changes required by regg altered the public’s experience of phe research and other information\-gathering activities. 

 in this respect it is crucial that regg did not simply rubber stamp phe research and practice; on the contrary, many of the studies regg reviewed were shown by the committee’s guiding principles to be ethically problematic. for example, 72% of research studies, and 58% of non\-research public health practice studies, submitted to regg in 2016 needed changes and a resubmission to regg prior to approval \[5.1\]. changes to studies required by regg ranged from minor to substantial amendments. as an indication, the sorts of changes required by regg to studies submitted in 2018 ranged from recruitment of participants \(including acquiring appropriate consent\), the content of participant\-facing documents \(such as information sheets and consent forms\), data management \(especially in light of gdpr and other recent data protection legislation\), and dissemination of findings \[5.4\]. regg also reviewed the scientific quality of studies, including research design \(e.g., sample size\) and method of statistical analysis, as grounded in holland’s published views \[3.4\]. 

 to illustrate the ways in which regg decisions impacted on study participants, a study to review dry blood spot testing in hmp liverpool, and another into bowel screening in north west prisons, both from 2018, required rewritten information sheets and consent forms to ensure that the prisoners were properly consented into the study; to provide appropriate access to support services if prisoners were upset by participation; to detail strategies in the event that the research revealed “incidental findings” such as poor practice in prisons; and to make improvements in data management \[5.6\]. prior to the foundation of the regg in 2015, whose monitoring processes were underpinned by holland’s research, such oversight to protect the interests of participants in phe studies did not exist. rejecting some applications for ethical approval, and requiring full overhaul and resubmission of others \[5.4\], resulted in regg “impacting positively on the quality of research and other public health studies led by phe staff” \[5.1\]. 

#####  4.2.5 influencing the ethical governance of public health research globally 

 regg’s impact extends beyond the uk. to illustrate, during the ebola outbreak in sierra leone in 2014/15, clinical specimens and accompanying data were collected from routine diagnostic testing, then transferred to phe laboratories in the uk for curation. the biobank held approximately 9,955 samples of which 1,108 were positive for ebola. the ministry of health and sanitation in sierra leone \(mohs\) retained ownership of the data and materials, and agreed to work with phe and other collaborators on a series of research projects to inform future public health strategy relating to ebola. the phe\-mohs ebola biobank governance group \(ebgg\) was established in 2015 to coordinate access to the data and materials for researchers and to ensure effective use of the resource. the remit of the group and the arrangements for the group’s oversight of the biobank were reviewed by regg, which required changes to the way the ebgg was modelled, prior to regg providing approval. the constitution of the regg in line with its guiding principles – as informed by holland’s research – thus gave phe a structure through which to ensure that the ethical implications of emergent situations could be dealt with effectively. this helped address press criticism regarding the removal of samples from west africa at the end of the ebola outbreak: “the arrangements that have been put in place at phe are regarded as being a good model for transparency and for ensuring that all ethical and governance concerns are addressed when the samples are used for research” \[5.7\]. 

#####  4.2.6 continuing impact: covid\-19 

 at the end of holland’s tenure, regg was described by phe’s chief executive as “a high performing ethics committee providing an efficient and high\-quality service” \[5.8\]. subsequently, regg has continued “in line with the group’s terms of reference” as established by holland \[5.1\] and based on holland’s research. to illustrate, regg has “played a vital role in the government’s response to the covid\-19 outbreak” \[5.1\]. in particular, regg has fast tracked twenty\-eight phe led studies into coronavirus since covid\-19 was first reported in the uk \[5.1\]. this process of expedited review is based on the triage system developed from holland’s research \[3.6\], and further demonstrates the wider impact of regg: “these reviews have allowed investigations to proceed safely and quickly in a rapidly changing environment so that phe could provide government, local government, the nhs, parliament, industry and the public with evidence\-based professional and scientific knowledge to manage and control the spread of this disease” \[5.1\].

###  1. summary of the impact 

 schmidt’s research into the history of chemical and biological weapons research in britain, the united states and canada has impacted policy making, civil society engagement and the public sphere by: 

-  contributing to, and shaping, international responses to chemical weapons’ incidents \(syria; salisbury\) through engagement with the organization for the prevention of chemical weapons \(opcw\) and the uk foreign and commonwealth office \(fco\). 

-  influencing policy makers on responses to chemical\-biological warfare threats by stressing the need to pool expertise and increase public understanding through ‘global partnership workshops’ and engagement with the opcw, fco, experts and civil society 

-  countering disinformation, by contextualising two major chemical weapons incidents \(malaysia, salisbury\) through opcw presentations. 

-  transforming understanding of the environmental impact of chemical and biological warfare by engaging communities and individuals through uk\-wide community exhibitions. 
","
###  2. underpinning research 

 schmidt’s research, which underpins this case study, examines the history of chemical and biological weapons research by the former allied powers during the twentieth century, specifically at the uk defence, science and technical laboratory, porton down. focusing on britain, the united states, and canada, schmidt’s *secret science* \(2015\) **\[r3\]** traced, for the first time, the history of chemical and biological weapons research involving experiments on humans by the former allied powers during the twentieth and twenty\-first centuries. it charted the ethical trajectory and culture of military science, from its initial development in response to germany’s first use of chemical weapons in the first world war to the ongoing attempts by the international community to ban these types of weapons once and for all. the study threw new light onto the evolving field of military medical ethics by exploring continuity and change in the understanding and application of military medicine and science. 

 key findings were derived from extensive archival research at: the national archives, kew; the national archives and records administration, washington d.c.; the churchill archives centre, cambridge; the imperial war museum; liddell hart centre for military archives, king's college london; the medical research council; the library and archives canada, ottawa; sussex university, brighton; and the wellcome trust, london. the research was also informed by schmidt’s wellcome funded project on *medical ethics and the legal dimension of britain's biological and chemical warfare programme*.  the research revealed that: 

-  breaches of medical ethics were significantly more widespread and systemic than previously assumed, and were carried out over a prolonged period of time **\[r3\]**. 

-  experiments were unusual in the magnitude of the risks to individuals and the environment. from 1946\-76 porton carried out more than 750 biological warfare ‘open air’ trials across cities and open countryside, exposing uk citizens and livestock to bw agents \(e.coli, zinc\-cadmium, plague, anthrax\). in 1963\-64, porton released b. *globigii* into the london underground **\[r3, r5\]**. 

-  a growing number of subjects were exposed to increasing dosages of chemical and biological warfare agents \(cbw\) known to be highly toxic and potentially lethal. porton’s nerve agents experiments in the 1950s were by far one of the largest nerve agent trials ever performed, involving over 1500 subjects **\[r2, r3, r4\]**. 

-  the highest degree of safety and the most rigorous standards of research ethics known at the time should have been applied **\[r1, r3, r6\]**. 

-  none of the evidence indicated that any of the civilians and subjects were ever informed about the specific objective of the trials. this challenges the claim by previous governments that ethics violations on both civilians and soldiers were isolated incidents **\[r2, r3, r4\]**. 

-  the history of human and animal experimentation cannot be restricted to national contexts alone but must be embedded in more global and transnational network of expert scientists \(uk, us, canada, australia, india, africa etc\) **\[r2, r3, r6\]**.

###  4. details of the impact 

 **influencing policy makers at the fco and opcw** 

 as a result of his research expertise on the history of porton down and cholinesterase\-inhibiting agents \(drawn from his 10\-year study *secret science* \(2015\) and other related publications\), schmidt has ‘participated in ongoing debates to influence and raise awareness of the historical context surrounding the use of chemical and biological weapons. schmidt’s contribution to these debates provided invaluable information for numerous authorities and policy makers to consider when shaping their responses to the global cbw threat. this expertise was made particularly valuable following the alleged use of nerve agents in syria \(since 2012\), and confirmed use in malaysia \(2017\), the united kingdom \(2018\), and russia \(2020\). in october 2015, the foreign and commonwealth office \(fco\) invited schmidt to attend an invitation\-only meeting entitled ‘arms control at 50 – does arms control have a future?’ where delegates considered the national and international challenges to arms control and disarmament **\[a\]**.  following this, he was invited to provide critical historical context at the organization for the prevention of chemical weapons’ \(opcw\) twenty\-second session of the conference of 133 states parties in 2017, when he delivered a keynote address on the subject of ‘preparing for poison warfare: the ethics and politics of britain’s chemical weapons programme, 1915\-1945’.  this was followed by a further invitation from opcw to provide the first plenary address, as one of only 8 non\-governmental officials to 106 states parties at the ‘fourth special session’ \(the hague, 26<sup>th</sup> june 2018\). during this he highlighted the importance of a ‘rules\-based approach’ in tackling both the context and complexity of the global threat from chemical and biological warfare agents \(cbw\) and called for recognition of his plan for a new ‘global partnership programme’ \(gpp\), which he had successfully trialled a month earlier \(see below\). schmidt’s contribution supported the uk government’s desire to strengthen the opwc’s role in combatting cbw use, the proliferation of cws, and the identification of those involved either as ‘perpetrators, organisers or sponsors’. this resulted in the opwc’s ‘decision addressing the threat from chemical weapons use’ **\[b\]** dated 27 june 2018. it also provided support for the global partnership programme. writing about the special sessions schmidt had addressed, a senior fco representative stated that he was ‘delighted with the outcome of the special sessions’ and deemed the outcomes ‘an important victory for arms control’ **\[c\]**. 

 following on from this, in november 2018, schmidt co\-organised a plenary session of the chemical weapons convention commission, where he gave a paper on ‘chemical weapons and the environment’ highlighting the role of civil society in contextualising the dangers of cw use **\[d\]**. also in 2019, schmidt presented his research at the brocher foundation in geneva, to an audience of scientists, ngos and experts on the ethics of medical and biotechnological research. his presentation on the ‘origins of research ethics committees in the uk military medical research’ was described by a senior world health organization official as ‘intriguing’ and which ’probably created the most interest among the participants on that day’.  the official went on to express the desire to maintain the useful working relationship that had been established **\[e\]**.  through engaging with officials, civil servants and policy makers at the foreign and commonwealth office, the organization for the prevention of chemical weapons, the chemical weapons convention commission and at the brocher foundation, schmidt has increased historical understanding, countered disinformation and influenced decision making within inter\-governmental organisations, the uk government and ngos. 

 **civil society engagement** 

 in may 2018, schmidt pioneered the concept of the global partnership programme, which would bring together policy makers and civil society and operate through a rolling series of global partnership workshops. reacting to the salisbury attack, schmidt realised the need for such events to allow a rapid response and space for confidential critical reflection between these stakeholders. conducted under chatham house rules, these workshops were attended by representatives from the opcw, fco, chemical weapons research facilities \(defence science and technology laboratory \(dstl\), porton down\), and the ngo green cross international, as well as the academic community.  the first global partnership workshop \(gpw\) in october 2018, centred on the history of nerve agents and the role of the chemical weapons convention. feedback was extensive and positive with a significant number of delegates reporting an increased appreciation of the importance of historical perspective to contemporary understandings.  attendees noted that ‘it essential to know the history of your area so that you can demythologise practices’, and that historical understanding ‘plays an incredibly important role \[…\] different perspectives, new information, different issues all contribute to development of questions, analysis \[and the\] identification of new sources’ **\[f\]**. 

 a second global partnership workshop, ‘cbw and the public sphere’ was held in may 2019 and focused on how the expert community could engage with the general public on cbw issues. a senior dstl official stated that the event was, ‘absolutely bloody crucial. lessons ignored = future mistakes’ and that ‘it is vital to learn from the past and to use historical information to understand further the contemporary situation’. another attendee reported the importance of analysing the past in order ‘to contextualise, and disentangle, the complexity and different elements of hybrid warfare – propaganda/information warfare and chemical warfare – that we face today and must counter as best we can’. others stated: ‘these are absolutely invaluable and will have a significant legacy in public understanding over coming years’ and ‘the great advantage of this workshop is the diversity of expertise and views of the participants, which lead to new ways of thinking and creative insights into how to tackle a difficult subject and policy area.’ participants reported an enhanced understanding that will help to ‘improve and transmit expertise and to maintain standards’ **\[g\]**. plans were then made to organise a third gpw that would bring together local civic leaders, expert scientists, academia and community representatives. as a result of covid\-19, these plans are in the process of being modified to facilitate an online exchange. 

 the second strand of schmidt’s global partnership programme was to ensure a link between policy makers, researchers and wider society. he did this by collaborating with the photographer, dara mcgrath, developing 10 community exhibitions under the title ‘this poisoned isle’. the exhibition was staged at seven community venues \(september 2018 to october 2019\) in cornwall, dorset, swansea, cambridgeshire, canterbury, yorkshire, and ullapool \(in the scottish highlands\) and engaged over 640 residents, policy makers, scientists, and academics. \(the remaining three that had been scheduled for 2020 had to be postponed due to the pandemic.\) 

 the exhibit explored the risk of residual contamination to communities that had been used to host the manufacture, storage, trials, and disposal of chemical weapons. with the salisbury attack inspiring much public discussion, the community exhibitions engaged with, informed and contextualised their communities’ relationship with chemical weapons.  intrinsic to the project was active engagement with visitors. all were encouraged to become involved in reciprocal conversations with mcgrath and schmidt about the issues explored in the exhibition. public responses to these exhibitions were then presented at the gpws to provide policy makers with vital civic feedback to further inform decision making. 

 the qualitative data from visitor surveys reveals the project created, and informed, community awareness, demonstrating: 

-  measurable change in the awareness of the extent to which cbw testing impacted upon, and contaminated, the environment. \[‘an eye opener’; ‘this exhibition brings home the importance of making people aware of what governments do on their behalf’; ‘it certainly raised awareness of the scale of activity and the geographical spread throughout the uk which was surprising especially the experiments carried out in some of the most beautiful places and the apparent lack of care for the environment and the population’\] 

-  greater awareness about the value, and fragility, of community cohesion and belonging, raising the potential for future involvement in local cbw policy issues. \[‘projects need to be made public so communities are aware and kept well\-informed of purposes & effects’; ‘people should be made aware of the dangerous or potential dangerous projects being undertaken on their doorstep’\] 

-  how problems for rural communities in accessing cbw knowledge can be overcome. \[‘it’s increased my awareness of the preponderance of these sites and made me realise the banality of the locations in today’s landscape’; ‘thank you for reminding us of our legacy.’; ‘our villagers were generally not very informed \[…\] we had heard about it but with no real detail, so it was good to be informed’\] 

-  increased awareness about government secrecy, lack of transparency, and failure to engage adequately with communities. \[‘the government needs to talk to local community’; ‘people should be made aware of the dangerous or potential dangerous projects being undertaken on their doorstep – but also aware that the majority of people would be against them – regardless of how ‘safe’ they would be’\] 

-  a renewed sense of pride about cbw sites in contributing to local economies and cbw preparedness. \[‘i love the fact that this touring exhibition has come to this community hall, something that doesn’t usually take place here and at the real heart of the community of the gower’\] **\[h\]**. 

 the exhibitions created a dialogue between local communities, schmidt’s research, and the policy making community \(via the global partnership programme\), thus connecting chemical and biologicals weapons policy\-making more strongly with civil society, achieving the goals set out by the global partnership workshops. schmidt and mcgrath intended to continue the exhibition series in 2020, with a further emphasis on building a national community of regions impacted by historical chemical and biological weapons policy via a forum and events that would bring disparate communities together to share experiences and engage in further historical research. however, these plans are currently on hold until the health crisis abates.

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 dance for parkinson’s \( *dfp*\) is a pioneering body of research led by dr sara houston that has encouraged people with parkinson’s disease \(pwps\) to dance, enabled dance artists to teach them, and helped dance organisations to support them. by providing an evidence base that demonstrates the benefits of dancing for pwps, houston has changed dance practice and transformed lives for pwps across australia, europe and north america. the research has had several specific impacts which have had global reach: 

1.  it has provided the evidence to support the expansion of the english national ballet’s *dfp* programme throughout england and wales; 

1.  it has raised the public profile, and embedded awareness, of the efficacy of *dfp* initiatives; and 

1.  it has enabled arts organisations, ballet and contemporary dance companies and independent dance artists to develop and advocate for *dfp* programmes. 

 *dfp* is also now widely recognised as a case study for demonstrating the value of arts, and arts\-based health interventions. 
","
###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 *dfp* is an innovative project, supported by a bupa foundation prize and the english national ballet \( **g1**\), to examine the potential benefits of dance for pwp and to explore what this might mean for dance practice and the arts community. the research was led by dr sara houston, with important contributions from ashley mcgill and professor raymond lee. 

 most medical research into parkinson’s has focused on finding a cure for the disease, or at least on understanding it in more depth. for many years it was thought that exercise would exacerbate the symptoms and consequently few studies were carried out on the effects of exercise on parkinson’s. in 2009, the consensus was challenged, and a growing corpus of biomechanical and neurological research now examines the effects of specific exercise on the symptoms of parkinson’s to investigate ways to improve motor control. however, research focused on symptomatic relief from a clinical perspective, and little had examined the role of arts activity. houston and mcgill’s work was the first in the uk to scrutinise how dance as art was experienced by pwps, the effects of dance on social and emotional wellbeing, balance, posture and gait, as well as the influence of pwps on dance practice \( **r1**, **r2**\). the research can be split into two phases: firstly, the examination and evaluation of the first years of the english national ballet \(enb\) *dfp* programme in london \(2010\-2015\), oxford \(2012\), liverpool \(2013\), cardiff \(2014\) and ipswich \(2014\) and secondly, the development of discussion and artistic experimentation with dance artists and pwps from around the world \(2011\-present\). 

 the empirical research carried out while evaluating the enb’s *dfp* classes \( **r2**, **r3**, **r4**\) concluded that: dance is a powerful activity for developing feelings of capability despite the progression of parkinson’s; the dancer finds that their condition interferes less with aspects of daily life; dance has a beneficial effect on non\-motor symptoms and psychological health, as well as on postural stability; dance develops feelings of community \(much more so than some other activities\); dance motivates and encourages people to initiate and take part in other activities in their communities; and dance improves aspects of quality of life that participants felt were important. 

 the fieldwork outlined above formed the basis for analysis and the creation of ideas \( **r2**, **r3**, **r4**\), significantly and unusually highlighting the amateur, disabled dancer rather than the elite professional. *dfp* argues that dance enables pwps to access powerful aesthetic feelings \- of feeling lovely, graceful and free \- that are crucial to understanding dance as a valuable experience in living well with a neurodegenerative condition. an important element of *dfp* is that it rearticulates these aesthetic concepts for a community dance/dance for health context, thereby reclaiming outdated and elitist concepts of art for the disabled non\-trained person. 

 these are the first insights in the field of dance and parkinson’s to address aesthetic issues and articulate their importance. this argument rearticulates aesthetic concepts in a context in which they had not previously had a place. they present a new, more inclusive, paradigm in dance studies and dance practice. *dfp* developed, and gave voice to, the argument that dance for parkinson’s initiatives have allowed dance artists to think differently about their own artistic practice, thereby promoting dance for health, not as a passive practice *done to* people, but as an active *reciprocal* practice that has affected dance artists, as well as participants \( **r2**, **r3**, **r6**\). this argument radicalises ideas around dance as therapy and around community dance in relation to professional dance making.

1.  **enabling the expansion of english national ballet’s dance for parkinson’s programme throughout england and wales** 

 houston’s pioneering research \( **r1**\- **r6**\) began in 2010 as an evaluation of the english national ballet’s \(enb\) community dance group for pwps. it has gone on to directly contribute to the development of their dance for parkinson’s programme, providing an evidence base to inform enb’s classes for pwp for the first time \( **imp1**\). the research authenticated the programme’s value, resulting in its expansion: evidence provided by *dfp* research enabled enb to partner with regional dance organisations, dance artists and musicians to expand the programme beyond london. since 2014, this has involved developing hubs in ipswich \(with dance east\) and cardiff \(with national dance company wales\). indeed, the hubs proved such a success that, between 2016 and 2019 they, along with the oxford and liverpool hubs, obtained sustainable funding to continue, using *dfp* research as evidence to ph holt, trusts and foundations and private donors. the hubs have been a way of embedding high quality *dfp* practice within four regions of england and wales with *dfp* research driving the evidence, advocacy and interest in enb’s work \( **imp2**\). 

 the *dfp* evidence contributed to a major repositioning of enb’s engagement department in the company and facilitated the increase of its workforce by 1 fte \(2016\) and 4.5 fte \(2019\). the research allowed enb to develop a dialogue around dance, health and research, resulting in committed evidence\-based practice for its engagement programmes, including its dance and dementia programme, as well as for national arts and health studies \(2018\-2020\). enb used houston’s research observations of good practice to successfully transfer its parkinson’s programme online during the pandemic in 2020 \( **imp2**\). 

 the engagement director at enb confirmed that the *dfp* research helped ‘to build the skills of the dance sector to deliver more high\-quality dance and cultural activities’ for pwp \( **imp2**\). for example, by developing a two\-day cpd course in conjunction with the hubs and delivering it twice between november 2014 and march 2015, 40 delegates from across the united kingdom were trained in *dfp* arts intervention methodologies \( **imp2**\). houston has translated the enb research to other dance and health arenas, including cpd events by the dance for parkinson’s partnership uk \(dfppuk\), in 2017/18 reaching 222 people \( **imp3**\). in march 2015, she delivered two further cpd programmes in partnerships with national swedish dance for parkinson’s in jönköping, sweden and dance for health in rotterdam, the netherlands, reaching a further 75 delegates \( **imp4**\). 

1.  **raising the public profile, and embedding awareness, of the efficacy of **dfp** initiatives** 

 leading on from her work with the enb, houston has raised the public profile of the benefits of dancing for pwps, galvanising public support and interest. through a sustained programme of public engagement, including media features, public talks and lectures, *dfp* has both raised awareness of the benefits of dance for pwp, and established dance for parkinson’s as an accepted and embraced activity. 

 *dfp* research has been shared with a wide\-reaching and diverse audience. the research has been cited in numerous media features, including press and television generating approximately 17,060,000 media impressions on audiences, and as a result has entered mainstream consciousness. this included houston’s appearance on itv’s *diversity live* in january 2015 with approximately 3 million viewers, and houston’s two interviews on *bbc breakfast* in october 2015 and december 2015 with approximately 7 million viewers each \( **imp4**\). according to dfppuk, media coverage has directly contributed to an increase in inquiries about where to dance and greater numbers of dance artists wanting to lead classes with pwps \( **imp3**\). *dfp*’s reach demonstrates that it carries an important message that resonates with the general public, namely that lives with chronic illness can change through dancing. 

 *dfp* and its legitimacy as an effective arts intervention has also been recognised amongst health professionals as a result of houston’s research. through public engagement events and talks, *dfp* has been shared with approximately 2,080 attendees outside the arts community, and most notably 1,785 health professionals. for instance, in 2016 houston and enb presented the research at the first national arts in health showcase for health commissioners and patient groups; run by arts enterprise with a social purpose, the event carried cpd accreditation for the professionals who attended. the royal society for public health produced a webinar with houston as one of its expert speakers, reaching an audience in 25 countries \( **imp4**\). 

1.  **enabling arts organisations, ballet and contemporary dance companies and independent dance artists to develop and advocate for parkinson’s dance programmes** 

 as awareness of the efficacy of dance provision for pwps spread to dance and health practitioners and to the public more widely, houston’s evidence of the benefits of dance and her expertise in *dfp* has enabled arts organisations, dance companies and dance artists to develop and advocate for dance programmes for pwps internationally. as the director of dance for parkinson’s disease \(dance for pd\) notes, *dfp* ‘has validated and underpinned the multi\-faceted, holistic and creative approach teaching artists in more than 25 countries use to engage with parkinson’s populations around the world’ \( **imp5**\). the number of dance classes for pwps within the uk has increased dramatically, thanks in part to houston’s initiation of mapping pwp provision overseen by dfppuk \( [https://www.communitydance.org.uk/creative\-programmes/dance\-for\-parkinsons](https://www.communitydance.org.uk/creative-programmes/dance-for-parkinsons)\), helping pwps to find a local class, as well as enabling dfppuk to identify where to develop further provision. this has resulted in a 35% annual increase in the number of listed classes, from only 20 uk classes in 2009 to 112 in 2019 \( **imp3**\). 

 building on the success of the enb research, *dfp* has gone on to play a pivotal role in the strategic development of dfppuk, which aims to develop the sustainability and growth of dance provision for pwps. as the director of dfppuk observes, houston’s research \( **r1**\- **r6**\), including the enb study \( **imp1**\), has informed the training of dance artists in the uk and internationally, including training provision in 2017/18 which resulted in the growth of 20 new initiatives across the uk, creating ‘new opportunities for approximately 300 more people living with parkinson’s having new access to dance’ \( **imp3**\). houston has further enabled dfppuk to strengthen and expand partnerships with organisations in germany, israel, italy, the netherlands, the uk and usa \( **imp3**\). 

 through international partnerships with artistic companies, *dfp* has also empowered dance artists and organisations to start programmes for pwps; create meaningful interdisciplinary collaborations to explore the benefits of their dancing initiatives; advocate for and report on the impacts of their programmes and gain funding to sustain programmes. houston’s research has been used by other dance companies to develop and fund their own programmes for pwps: 

-  dance for pd, new york, usa, has used *dfp* research to train 2,000 teaching artists and allied health professionals, develop lesson plans they use in their new york program and supply these to trainees around the world as part of their dance for parkinson’s online course and assessment and dance for pd certification program. as their program director notes, the research ‘raised the global profile of the dance for pd programme… allowing the program to expand from one class in brooklyn \(2001\) to classes in more than 300 communities in 25 countries \(2020\).’ he estimates that houston’s research has reached approximately 5,000 pwp along with 5,000 of their carers and family members through the programme \( **imp5**\). 

-  hamilton city ballet \(hcb\), canada, used *dfp* research to construct their own class for pwp and houston has worked with the company to develop best practice in teaching these classes, proving essential to their development and launch. hcb has also used houston’s research in the development of dance\-based activity for pwp to use in their homes in partnership with mcmaster university. hcb dfp classes have since gone on to reach 80 pwp \( **imp6**\). 

-  in australia, queensland ballet set up a programme inspired by the enb\- *dfp* partnership; houston served on the advisory board in order to develop best practice, *dfp* research methods were used to evaluate the pilot of their own dfp class and *dfp* research was cited in the resulting report. after the queensland ballet class was established, *dfp* was embedded into 19 classes over four territories \( **imp7**\). 

-  houston’s research \( **r1**\- **r6**\) has further shaped the practice of dance well, a dance programme for pwp in the city of bassano del grappa, italy. her research \( **r1**\- **r6**\) has supported dance well teachers in eight italian and two japanese cities, and has been further incorporated in a contemporary dance festival involving 35 cities and 300 multidisciplinary events \( **imp8**\). 

 *dfp* has enabled arts organisations to advocate and fund programmes for pwps by providing an empirical basis for these interventions. this is demonstrated by enb’s successful funding bid for cultural commissioning funds of £40,391 from westminster ccg to sustain the london programme for an extra year, using houston and mcgill’s report \( **imp1**\) to show the programme’s benefits. the ccg specifically ‘cited the development of the evidence base for post\-diagnosis support as an evidence for grant giving’ as a reason for the application’s success \( **imp2**\). step up for parkinson’s \(malta\) which now runs classes in four different locations around the country, reported that use of the research as evidence to support their proposals enabled them to receive the funding needed to set up these classes \( **imp9**\). in february 2020, dfppuk won £500,000 over four years from the national lottery community fund to extend its work to six uk regions where there is currently little provision for pwps; the application drew heavily upon houston’s research \( **imp3**\). 

1.  **demonstrating the value of arts and arts\-based health interventions** 

 broader key impacts achieved by *dfp* lie in embedding of the value of arts interventions for those with long term health conditions in the general understanding of arts and medical practice. *dfp* has provided essential groundwork for additional academic studies about the benefits of dance for pwps, including queensland ballet programme by queensland university of technology and university of queensland, hamilton city ballet programme by mcmaster university, dance for pd by university of denver, and scottish ballet programme by royal conservatoire of scotland. 

 as the co\-founder of the dance for parkinson’s network wrote, ‘in a field where the benefits of arts interventions are often difficult to quantify, the integrity of sara’s work \[ **r1**\- **r6**\] has given it gravitas not only to arts practitioners and therapists, but also in the related fields of healthcare and neurology \- which is no mean achievement. it remains the go\-to research’ \( **imp10**\). according to bassano del grappa’s director of dance initiatives, not only has houston’s research raised awareness of the benefits of such programmes, but she further ‘contributed to articulate a language around dance practices and approaches that are in use but sometimes difficult to describe and share beyond the dance field facilitating the dialogue with scientists, neurologists, riabilitators \[rehabilitators\]’ \( **imp8**\). in sum, the program director of dance for pd testifies that, ‘the research \[ **r1**\- **r6**\] \[…\] resulted in data and insights that have fundamentally shaped the field of dance for people with parkinson’s and, more broadly, the field of arts in health’ \( **imp6**\).

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 artist\-researchers in the centre for dance research have engaged people experiencing ageing, illness and loss in dialogue through dance. through published texts, workshops, talks and choreographic works for both live audience and screen, dr beatrice allegranti’s and professor emilyn claid’s artistic research has: 

1.  enhanced and improved the psychological, cognitive and physical wellbeing of individuals experiencing ageing, illness and loss, along with their families and carers; 

1.  shaped the practice of dance artists and health professionals; and, 

1.  embedded dance interventions for ageing, loss and young\-onset dementia within major healthcare and cultural organisations across south east england 

 allegranti and claid’s research has developed dialogic and relational modes of working with lasting significance for individuals and organisations addressing ageing and its effects, as their models of creative practice are carried into participants’ wider personal and professional lives and communities. allegranti’s extensive choreographic work with people living with young onset dementia \(yod\) enables reflection and progressive change in experiences of the condition. claid’s somatic research into falling repositions the experience as one of agency and change, fostering sustainable ways of being with ageing and vulnerability. 
","
###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 the artistic research of allegranti and claid addresses the question of how to sustain, empower and promote agency for self and others through the challenges of ageing, illness and loss. for over two decades, debates around artistic research have questioned the relation of practice to theory, and how embodied processes and associated critical reflection advance the production and theory of art. less attention has been paid, however, to collaborative artistic research uniquely designed to innovate and propose new ways of relating. these researchers redress this by facilitating – via choreographic and somatic means – a reconsideration of how people relate to one another, and to their wider environments. 

 allegranti’s interdisciplinary choreographic and psychotherapeutic research \( **r1**, **r2**\) develops bespoke performances *with* and *for* families living with yod. incorporating feminist new materialism and posthumanism, her research engages with the ethics and politics of kinship, vulnerability, othering and care. allegranti’s work posits the entanglement of bodies with environment and language, to reframe experiences of vulnerability and loss. the research introduces an understanding of how affective\-kinaesthetic relating can effect progressive change for the person living with dementia and their carers, as well as for the artistic team working with them. her dance film *i can’t find myself* \( **r3**\) was informed by fieldwork interviews with dementia care networks \(both lay and professional carers\). the practice\-research places emphasis on the value of kinaesthetic communication where people’s cognitive faculties are impaired, particularly within dementia relationships where meaning\-making through language as we ‘know it’ is changed and challenged. autobiographical, medical and cultural narratives from the fieldwork were incorporated into the film through a series of choreographic and sonic vignettes, capturing the tactile\-kinaesthetic resonance of memories, interactions and shifting identities, and inviting audiences to recognize taboos around loss and the impact of dementia on relationships. a full\-length performance based on autobiographical contributions, *i’ve lost you only to discover that i have gone missing* \( **r4**\), was subsequently developed and toured to 11 venues. the production envisions dementia in a way that disrupts, wider social, political and culturally ubiquitous inequalities of age, loss of 'self' and life, as well as voice, troubling the linear causality of ‘story’ and opening into a wider ecology according to each contextually and relationally contingent performance. 

 the research of allegranti and claid enables those facing ageing, illness and loss to coexist and reimagine their experiences of vulnerability and othering by offering new modes of expression and new experiences of physicality through dance. claid’s research \( **r5**, **r6**\) draws on gestalt psychotherapy, somatic movement, and choreographic practices, to reposition falling as an intentional experience of agency and change. through dance practice and movement\-based therapy, falling is reframed as creative resource for developing self and environmental support. explored relationally, physically, psychologically and metaphorically, the action of falling comes to be understood as refiguring relations between body, gravity and ground. claid’s research draws on intersubjective practices of encounter to foster sustainable ways of being with ageing and vulnerability, alongside dying as a ‘falling through life’ with others \( **r5**\). her choreographic film, *a long side* \( **r6**\) further explores the theme of falling by documenting processes of falling out of fixed choreography, whilst exploring themes of economic decline and ageing community among older dance participants in south eastern northumberland.

###  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 both allegranti and claid’s research uses dialogic methods to focus most immediately on the participants in their choreographic and somatic work, who, as a result of engaging with these dialogic dance methods, experience improved psychological, cognitive and physical wellbeing. dance becomes a way to learn about ageing, illness and loss in embodied and progressive ways. allegranti and claid also use dialogic methods to broaden understanding of a given situation or practice \(intentional falling, living with yod\), and to build practical tools for future application \(e.g. in therapists’ work, artists’ collaborations and their relationship to audiences, or the daily lives of families affected by illness and loss\). 

1.  **enhancing the psychological, cognitive and physical wellbeing of those experiencing ageing, illness and loss along with their families and carers** 

 allegranti and claid have worked closely with diverse groups of participants to develop projects which engage with the experiences, circumstances and embodied knowledges of their members. as part of her *moving kinship* hubs \(methodology discussed in **r1** and **r2**\) developed with and for diverse audiences, allegranti has created bespoke performances in collaboration with 36 families living with yod. claid’s research has similarly engaged participants in the process of its development and has helped participants in a public workshop at tower bridge manage their vertigo as well as improved the psychological, cognitive and physical wellbeing of the elderflowers, a group of 14 older people from a former mining town in south east northumberland. 

 the inherent methodology of mutual recognition in allegranti’s *moving kinship* project has evoked feelings of empowerment and improved the wellbeing of the participants. allegranti’s use of dialogic methods, emphasising engagement, capacity and co\-creativity \( **r1**, **r2**\), has enabled participants to mourn losses and address taboos through safe, playful choreographic engagement. the reach of this research has been substantial: internationally established *moving kinship* hubs have been attended by 1,140 people in venues across japan, norway and the united kingdom \( **imp1**\). the combined psychological and kinaesthetic benefits to participants are demonstrated by feedback following the participatory hubs: one family carer commented that the dance was a ‘nice way for us to be together as a family in complete contrast to normal. to move, be in contact, to just be with each other. all centred around dementia, a burden we all face day to day – but it came as a release rather than a reminder.’ another reported that, ‘it was incredibly liberating to see mum enjoy and be so engaged in the dance; for the first time in a while i was able to leave her to herself and her own enjoyment without feeling guilt or responsibility. it was so incredibly cathartic for me and let me release a lot of anxiety and stress.’ equally, the dances also allowed the participants living with yod to express themselves. as one reported, ‘i have fronto temporal dementia, non\-fluent. can’t speak or sing. music, art and dancing is best for me’. another wrote of her experience, ‘i enjoy the intense expressions on faces and the body emotive movements. i feel like moving… also being part of a group making close connections feels good’ \( **imp2**\). 

 in 2015, claid’s research, which demonstrates the clinical usefulness of the practice of falling in gestalt psychotherapeutic practice \( **r5**\), underpinned a public workshop held at tower bridge. claid worked with 15 members of the public who experienced vertigo and fear of heights, using somatic and mindful falling skills to help them manage body\-based sensations that arose without allowing fear to take over. this enabled them to walk over the glass walkway at the bridge, which is 42 metres above the thames \( **imp3**\). media coverage enhanced public understanding of the use of falling to combat the effects of vertigo. before the workshop, claid appeared on itv’s *good morning britain*, working with an itv presenter who experiences vertigo to walk the glass walkways \( **imp4**\), reaching the programme’s approximately 1,000,000 daily viewers. 

 claid’s participatory project has also inspired a group of older residents of the area of northumberland around woodhorn museum, who in 2016 commissioned a project to enable people in the area to create and take part in inspiring and high\-quality arts experiences. south east northumberland is a particularly deprived area of the uk, following the demise of the coal mining and fishing industries. the core issues for this group are ageing and economic decline. claid’s research on falling – how working with gravity can bring psychological and metaphorical support – informed the devising process for participants as well as their choices of material and ways of film\-making \( **r5**, **r6**\). as a result of the work, claid produced a choreographic film with filmmaker lucy cash, called *a long side* \( **r6**\). participating in the film resulted in enhanced wellbeing for those involved. of taking part in the film, one participant reported that, ‘i have done things i would never have without the encouragement of others’, another that ‘i have arthritis in my hands… when we first started they were painful—as we went on, they got better’ \( **imp5**\). 

1.  **shaping the practice of dance artists and health professionals** 

 due to the clear benefits of these dance and choreographic methodologies for those participating, dissemination of allegranti’s and claid’s research and dialogic methodologies have shaped and enriched dance and health practitioners’ practice as they have learned how to better support their own and others’ wellbeing through adoption of these principles into their practice. 

 comments by the approximately 250 participants in claid’s workshops on falling \( **r5**, **r6**\) in australia, new zealand, the uk and the us attest to the new inspiration experienced by dance artists and the motivation they felt to bring the new practices to which they were introduced into their art. one described the experience as having ‘given me a new paradigm through which to engage with my life/ world/ studio practice’ and said she would incorporate claid’s dialogic process into her work: ‘the way in which we… engage with vulnerability and support… was very useful for my practice…i will use what i have learnt in future rehearsal processes’. an attendee of a workshop in 2018 reported that her practice would ‘benefit from a boost in confidence in pursuing the potential intelligence of embodied practice’, whilst another commented that she would, ‘create more time for falling – and work with contact improvisation/aikido and gain a sense of technique needed to fall and catch or be caught falling – safely.’  the resilience she would gain from practicing embodied falling would benefit her work as a workshop facilitator for child assault prevention uk: ‘if i can become more comfortable with falling and model an acceptance to fail and make mistakes... i will develop a greater resilience to bounce back. in turn by modelling this to the children/ young people i work with… they too can build more resilience and bounce in adverse situations’ \( **imp6**\). 

 similarly, workshops led by claid \( **r5**, **r6**\) for psychotherapeutic organisations in six countries \(australia, finland, italy, new zealand, the uk and the us\) resulted in the adoption of her research by psychology practitioners. one psychotherapist claimed the workshop had ‘impacted both my psychotherapy practice as well as the training that i teach’ and further reported that he subsequently used falling as a metaphor to support issues of loss \( **imp6**\). the reach of claid’s work is evidenced by the approximately 60 participants in the workshops and the range of their own practices in which they embedded the findings of the research, and extended to their networks of associated organisations, workplaces and relationships \( **imp1**\). one participant in a workshop in italy noted that he would now include exercises in group therapy settings \( **imp6**\). the reach of the research has been extended to business contexts; for example, a psychotherapist now uses claid’s discursive methods in personal development training for the senior management at ingram micro, an it company with offices in 170 countries \( **imp7**\). 

 similarly, the *moving kinship* methodology was disseminated internationally to approximately 260 dance, music, theatre and psychotherapy practitioners through workshops and collaborations in japan, norway and the uk \( **imp1**\). this has informed the practice of dance and theatre artists across the globe, causing practitioners to re\-think methods of engaging with artistic creation as a form of embodied activism. allegranti’s *moving kinship* performance hubs \(methodology discussed in **r1** and **r2**\) involved dialogic collaboration with the professional dance artists who worked with allegranti to choreograph bespoke responses to the stories of these families. the hubs profoundly affected the dance artists’ understanding of the value of their somatic practices, artistic skills and psychological investment. as one dancer reported of the experience, ‘i have been inspired by the dance movement psychotherapy approaches beatrice works with to find an honest and heart\-felt response to my creative work. this has allowed the emotional integrity of the participants’ stories to shine out through our movement’ \( **imp2**\). another noted that dancing in the hubs had evolved his dance practice in directions he would not have considered otherwise. it affected the dancers personally as well: ‘my dad is living with dementia and the process allowed me to engage with performance in deeper and more meaningful ways \[…\] the progressive nature of these sessions, and the exchange of energy from dancers to participants results in a dialogic exchange of energy and emotion... where all participate as equals’. this dancer has gone on to use *moving kinship* methodology in his inclusive dance practice with around 100 stateless people in japan, thailand and the uk \( **imp8**\). 

1.  **embedding dance interventions for ageing, loss and yod within major healthcare organisations** 

 since 2017, allegranti’s *moving kingship* hubs \(drawing from **r1**\- **r4**\) have been incorporated into the recommendations of major health and cultural organisations and included as part of social prescribing in gp surgeries. this creative and psychosocial intervention enabled allegranti to hold 24 monthly hubs for families working on referrals from haringey and merton councils; st george’s nhs neurology unit; dementia action alliance; public health england in collaboration with merton arts space and merton council; and alexandra palace. the hubs provide an important means for these organisations to achieve their missions and aims; for example, alexandra palace designates their work with allegranti as ‘a flagship project… helped raise the profile of the charity as a place that supports community cohesion, wellbeing and somewhere that people might seek support or advice’. allegranti’s research has become embedded widely in referrals for those living with yod, and in 2017, dementia action alliance and public health england cited the work as an exemplar of ‘innovative creative practice in dementia’. in 2020, surrey arts partnership commissioned the hubs across the county, expected to start in 2021, as allowed by government regulations \( **imp9**\). 

 the reach of allegranti’s research amongst both dance and health practitioners has been essential to embedding socially and psychologically imbued dance practice as a means of achieving positive outcomes for families living with yod, providing an example of best practice for how artistic research can be used to benefit end users. 24 screenings of allegranti’s dance film *i can’t find myself* \( **r3**\), a discursive resource for enhancing kinaesthetic communication with lay and professional dementia carers, reached a total audience of 1,412, including medical professionals, with further screenings reaching the alzheimer’s society in 2017 and the dementia pathfinder’s annual award ceremony in 2016. comments from attendees emphasised how the film empowered them to ‘\[recognise\] again how much you can help people with art’ and to acknowledge ‘how non\-verbal communication through touch and movement can help’ \( **imp10**\). the screendance was the cover story of *therapy today,* the british association for counselling and psychotherapy’s magazine, reaching over 40,000 monthly readers \( **imp1**\) and has subsequently been used as a family support and staff development resource by dementia pathfinders \( **imp9**\). 

 after the success of *i can’t find myself*, allegranti developed a full\-length production based on her research \( **r1**\- **r3**\) and the hubs. the performance, *i’ve lost you only to discover i’ve gone missing* \( **r4**\), has toured to 11 venues to date as a work\-in\-progress, reaching an audience of 580. allegranti created a short film that includes an extract from the performance. an audience member stated that, ‘it has reminded me of how important co regulation is, particularly with people who have dementia… i will approach any other contact… with a renewed sense of connection’; another that they had realised their need to ‘move, express’ more \( **imp1**\).

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 edwards’ research informed the world health organisation’s \(who\) ethics guidance and a training manual for clinical research during epidemics of emerging and re\-emerging infectious diseases, for which no effective treatments or vaccines are known. the ethics guidance applied to 4955 studies undertaken into who’s priority infectious diseases and pathogens with over 88 million participants globally. edwards' research has benefited individuals participating in clinical research by promoting wider access to new and repurposed medicines and by protecting the rights and interests of current patients. edwards initiated the development of an afrocentric ethics framework for clinical research during epidemics across africa and supervised a project for the african union centres for disease control \(africa cdc\), involving wide consultation, engagement, and training. her expertise has been consulted over clinical research for covid\-19 by organisations such as who, africa cdc, and the us fda which issued new guidelines leading to >370 early approvals of medicines and medical products with surveillance for research.

###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 professor sarah edwards has developed a leading body of research, which examines the relationship between ethics and methodology in clinical research. she argues that trial design can be made more responsive to current patients’ clinical needs without sacrificing methodological rigour or scientific gain. in 2013, she published the first article \[ **r1**\] to define the unique moral challenges raised by, and develop ethical standards for, clinical research specifically during the circumstances of public health crises for which no known effective treatments or vaccines exist. these exceptional moral concerns, she argues, undermine the traditional precautionary assumptions that underlie the regulation of medicines. under such approaches, access to new medicines should be initially restricted to small samples of the population in order first to establish a new treatment’s safety and efficacy, often through the conventional randomised controlled trial \( **rct**\), before making them more widely available. where a particular new or repurposed treatment offers a patient the only potential chance at life, then the liberty to access that treatment directly is a significant one. during public health emergencies, such restrictive regulatory rules are more difficult to justify since they primarily seek to gain knowledge to treat future, rather than current patients whose lives could be immediately threatened. edwards argues that science can advance successfully through ‘natural experiments’ which prioritise individual and current patients’ interests providing direct access to potentially beneficial medicines. 

 edwards hosted an international academic conference in june 2014 to review her work in \[ **r1**\]. representatives from regulatory agencies participated in the conference including the world health organization, the us food and drug administration \( **fda**\), and the european medicines agency \( **ema**\). in august that year, ebola was officially declared a public health emergency of international concern. with collaborators, edwards secured two major awards from the european african clinical trials partnership \( **edctp**\) to support research during epidemics across africa \[ **i**\], one specifically for ebola to gauge local views and values \[ **ii**\]. 

 to help undermine the regulatory premise behind restricting access to new medicines in the way outlined above, edwards later targeted the epistemic assumption that placebo controlled rcts are the most efficient scientific method to gain knowledge to treat future patients. in \[ **r2**\], edwards with colleagues in philosophy of science, argued that robust scientific methods use data from different sources including from wild animals which may also be susceptible to similar diseases as humans, for example ebola in chimpanzees and gorillas. methodological pluralism holds that claims regarding causality are more credible when evidence from different sources points to a similar result. developing a range of methods for ‘real\-world’ research, edwards, with colleagues, developed an ethical framework for so\-called pragmatic trials whose aim is to generate data on how interventions could work in practice rather than under artificial conditions of a conventional placebo\-controlled trial \[ **r3**\]. edwards later showed that a pragmatic approach could efficiently replace the need for subsequent ‘implementation studies’ to establish how well clinical trial results can be applied more widely especially in the context of covid\-19 \[ **r4**\]. given the sheer number of new and repurposed treatment candidates available, large effects will become apparent from smaller observational or ‘screening’ studies especially when no formal clinical trial has \(yet\) been set up as in \[ **r5**\].

###  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 edwards’ research shaped the world health organisation’s \( **who**\) **guidance for managing ethical issues in infectious disease outbreaks**, for clinical research during public health crises, and also helped to inform the who training programme. edwards’ expertise initiated and supported the development of an afrocentric ethics framework for clinical research during epidemics across africa. her expertise had been sought to help prioritise ethical and efficient research for covid\-19 by who, africa cdc, and the us fda amongst others. 

 **shaping global ethical standards for clinical research during public health emergencies** 

 the numbers of clinical research studies internationally, especially in developing countries, are increasing as more public health crises arise, and emerging and re\-remerging infectious diseases, especially zoonoses \(infectious diseases caused by pathogens jumping from animals to humans\), become increasingly problematic with human populations encroaching on wildlife and engaging in intensive farming. in turn, this has led to changes in the ways in which clinical research is conducted, particularly by ensuring the use of a robust ethical framework for evaluating study designs and methodology. edwards' research has benefited individuals participating in clinical research by promoting wider access to new and repurposed medicines and by protecting the rights and interests of current patients. in so doing, the research has helped to address the problem of designing and recruiting participants for clinical research during public health emergencies. 

 edwards’ research informed training of healthcare workers and researchers by who and other organisations. edwards’s 2013 paper \[ **r1**\] was reviewed by who and international regulators including the fda and ema at the conference she held in june 2014. the **who training manual,** **ethics in epidemics, emergencies and disasters: research, surveillance and patient care** \[ **a**\] **,** was published in 2015 and later translated into chinese. it had been downloaded >4,000 times by 31\-12\-2020 \[ **a**\]. the manual discusses \[ **r1**\] under three of its seven core competencies, including the “ability to define adequate processes for ethics review in public health interventions, surveillance and research in emergencies”. it also contains a case study based on \[ **r1**\] \[in **a**, pp.70\-71\]. edwards’ \[ **r1**\] is cited ten times in the manual, and other papers by edwards a further five times \[ **1**\]. the manual thus seeks to illustrate the ethical problems and putative solutions identified in \[ **r1**\] to encourage more consideration and critical thought on why new medicines are restricted and how health research can progress in context. edwards also served as a named reviewer of this manual for who. the manual addresses what it calls a “lack of international consensus” on some aspects of research, surveillance and patient care in emergencies and is designed to “give participants a certain proficiency in ethical reasoning and awareness of the main ethical dilemma that can arise in emergencies” \[ **a**\]. consequently, it has been regularly used by who in training workshops run globally. in addition, the course has been taken 16,795 times on the global health network \(a digital platform that delivers training, skills and career development to healthcare workers and researchers\) alone \[ **b**\]. participants commented that they would now consider all the issues raised in the course before making decisions and they would seek to disseminate the guidance further by including it in their own courses \[ **b**\]. healthcare workers and researchers are, as a result, better equipped to use innovative trial designs, natural experiments, and real\-world data to respond to epidemics and improving access to and standards for clinical care along the way. 

 edwards is a named participant who contributed to the writing of **who **guidance for managing ethical issues in infectious disease outbreaks**, published in 2016 and later translated into chinese, farsi and faroese \[ **c**\]. edwards’ paper \[ **r1**\] identified the ethical problems associated with restricting access to clinical trials during epidemics for which no proven treatment had been established at the outset of the outbreak. it also sought to resolve these problems using innovative trial designs and natural experiments and use of “real\-world” data. the who guidance \[ **c**\] specifically gives guidance on innovative study designs to help promote the interests of current patients while gaining knowledge through research. who facilitates research on diseases posing public health threats of international concern and is legally authorised under the international health regulations \( **ihrs**\). the ihrs is a legally binding agreement governing questions of global health particularly public health emergencies of international concern. who guidance is technically referred to as “soft” or quasi\-law. while not legally binding as a code of practice, adherence by signatories of the ihrs is expected to enable who to discharge its legal function. when a public health emergency is declared, who has greater legal powers and adherence to guidance is more critical. since the guidance was published, a total of 4955 studies with over 88 million participants have been publicly recorded \(on clinicaltrials.gov\) to address who’s priority infectious diseases and pathogens including ebola, marburg virus, crimean\-congo haemorrhagic fever, rift valley fever, lassa fever, and zika. through endorsement of edwards’ research in \[ **r1**\], who guidance governed the above studies of which 4397 studies were specifically related to covid\-19 with 87,024656 participants. the guidance was downloaded 28,300 times in the period april\-october 2020 alone, predominantly in the united states \(14,300 downloads\) \[ **c**\]. edwards' research has thus benefited the many individual patients treated during outbreaks by promoting wider access to new and repurposed medicines, and future patients by protecting standards for clinical research. 

 **development of an afrocentric ethics framework for clinical research during epidemics of infectious diseases and training research ethics committee and regulators in central africa** 

 through pandora\-id net \[ **i**\], a consortium of organisations across africa and europe supporting research in emerging and re\-emerging infectious diseases, edwards was enlisted in 2018 to support the newly formed **africa centres for disease control \(africa cdc\)**, part of the african union, to initiate the development of an **authoritative african ethics framework for research during epidemics** across africa \[ **d**\]. to help develop the framework, and drawing on her expertise in **r1**, edwards hosted a series of physical and virtual meetings with the africa cdc to help consult and engage african communities of ethics committees, medical scientists, and public health practitioners \[ **d**\]. this included a “workshop for research ethics committees across the whole continent” attended by over 200 delegates, which “was the first event of its kind designed to facilitate shared discussion of an exchange of views on research ethics” \[ **e**\]. as the director of africa cdc, explains, “the information gained from the consultative work to date has already informed our approach to integrating research into outbreak responses in ethical ways”, including consideration of “repurposing vast numbers of existing therapies in an attempt to manage cases of covid\-19”. \[ **d**\] they confirm, “edwards’ work helped to systematize these efforts with research goals in mind, bringing them into line with who guidance on ethics and study design during public health emergencies” \[ **d**\]. three quarters of respondents \(from 51 african countries\) felt that in the absence of available standard treatments, patients with confirmed infection during epidemics could benefit from unregistered interventions for which there is some scientific rationale. regarding conventional placebo\-controlled trials during outbreaks with high case fatality rates, there were three times the number of respondents who considered such trials to be unethical than ethical \[ **d**\]. while the resulting framework is yet to be finalised by the african union, the head of public health institutes and research for africa cdc, who leads their public health research programme, has already put the approach to ethics and evidence into practice, for example through collaboration with some 800 senior first responders and integrating research into outbreak response, supported by edwards \[ **d**\]. edwards mentored the head of public health institutes and research by supervising the project, from which the above survey results are drawn, through the **chatham house african leaders’ fellowship** 2018/19 \[ **f**\]. their collaboration is being used as a model by the africa cdc: “to help strengthen national public health institutes in each african union member state, we continue these conversations in ways first illustrated in taj’s chatham house work with edwards” \[ **d**\]. 

 as a member of pandora\-id net, edwards has contributed to the training of over 300 members of research ethics committees and regulators in central africa, drawing on her expertise in **r1.** in april 2018, edwards organised training **in congo brazzaville during the 9<sup>th</sup> outbreak of ebola** at the request of the minister of health \[ **e**\]. there were over 300 participants, including members of the national ethics committees and regulators from central africa. in light of reviewing \[ **r1**\] and the who guidance, participants drafted standard operating procedures for research ethics committees and a community engagement and risk communication strategy for who afro, which adopts clinical research in a broader sense than clinical trials \[ **e**\]. as the pandora\-id net coordinator confirms “these documents were used for a preparedness response exercise across these countries then considered at high risk of ebola, and were subsequently used to expand community consultation and engagement \[regarding clinical research\] during the 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> outbreaks of ebola in drc” \[ **e**\]. during the **10<sup>th</sup> outbreak of ebola in democratic republic of congo**, “edwards’ expertise in clarifying the ethical implications for clinical decision\-making of using unregistered medical interventions” contributed to a workshop for small teams of specialist first responders in uganda and a training event held in october 2018 in kinshasa, drc \[ **e**\]. both events were specifically designed to support the availability and off\-label use of four then experimental drugs for ebola and detail the requirements for consent in so doing. they were also designed to prepare the teams for recruiting to clinical trials that were later organised in the drc to randomly allocate patients to these four drugs respectively without a placebo\-only control. 

 **shaping covid\-19 responses through research ethics advice** 

 edwards participated in the **who r&d blueprint meeting on covid\-19** in geneva in february 2020 where she helped identify important gaps in knowledge in the social sciences and in ethics regarding limits to extrapolating social and cultural acceptability of new therapeutics and vaccines from other contexts such as influenza or ebola and from other countries in which previous study had been undertaken \[ **g**\]. soon thereafter, edwards was invited “as a member and key advisor” to join the apandemic initiative, which aims to “inform and support real\-world evidence for covid\-19 research and decision\-making”, with the aim of encouraging “regulators and researchers to design studies which are methodologically efficient and ethical” \[ **h**\]. as the  president of the center for medicine in the public interest and member of apandemic reports “edwards’ research on ethics and methodology \[ **r1** and **r4**\] informed our \[apandmics’s\] **debate with** **us fda**”. he explains “the pandemic has forced the us fda to acknowledge the value of using real\-world evidence mainly as surveillance of medicines which have been approved for widespread use earlier than usual” and the fda has “now issued guidance on using real\-world data to support regulatory decisions”, allowing medicines to be approved early for widespread use subject to later surveillance rather than waiting until after the traditional stages of clinical trials have been fully completed. \[ **h**\] >370 products \(vaccines; drug and biological therapeutic products; in vitro diagnostic products; personal protective equipment and related medical devices; ventilators and other medical devices\) have currently been approved under this guidance for covid\-19 \[ **h**\]. edwards helped set up a **compassionate access to medicines** programme at st george’s hospital nhs trust and medical school establishing access to the drug tocilizumab which turned out to be life\-saving. in 2020, in addition to the consultative workshop for the africa cdc \(see above\), she participated in a joint webinar hosted by pandora\-id net, the global health network and alerrt on research ethics during public health emergencies \(particularly covid\-19\) attended by over 300 delegates \[ **e**\]. edwards was also invited to give a keynote lecture in november 2020 to help shape and formalise **early approval of new or repurposed medicines and vaccines** **for covid\-19 in israel** which has seen the first mass population vaccine programme for covid\-19 in the world with extensive “real\-world” research \[ **i**\]. 110 participants from 19 countries attended and the deputy academic director explains that: “from my own perspective as an ethicist and a lawyer specializing in public health policy, medical risk management and clinical care in israel, these issues had been largely unclear and edwards helped develop our thinking on the topic”. she “helped consolidate views on the therapeutic rationales and evidence for different treatments, as well as developing procedures for off label monitoring for research. in this way, we are able to offer a practical framework to provide access to new or repurposed treatments ethically and lawfully in hospitals with suitably trained healthcare staff” \[ **i**\].

###  1. summary of the impact 

 some women make birth choices that healthcare professionals consider dangerous. such choices raise urgent questions. dr elselijn kingma’s research argues that women have the right to make many such choices; that healthcare professionals ought to proactively support such choices once made; and that understanding the nature of pregnancy can help us to appreciate these and other moral issues surrounding pregnancy and birth. kingma’s research has critically shaped the dutch legal, medical, activist and policy framework surrounding maternity care. the specific impacts described here are: 

1.  **changing dutch legal precedent**, protecting healthcare professionals from prosecution if they assist ‘deviant’ births. 

1.  **critically shaping clinical guidelines** issued jointly by the *dutch royal college of midwives* \(knov\) and the *dutch college of obstetrics and gynaecology* \(nvog\). 

1.  directly and indirectly **changing dutch government health policy**. 

1.  influencing key strategic and policy decisions by **two dutch** **charities**: \(a\) *geboortebeweging* \(women’s advocacy\) and \(b\) *clara wichmann* \(litigation\) 

1.  shaping discussion of the **landmark bravis court case**. 

1.  **providing professional training** for health and social workers. 
","
###  2. underpinning research 

 the rights and obligations of women during pregnancy and birth are the focus of long\-standing and recurring discussion in philosophy, ethics and law. philosophical discussion of this topic often focuses on abortion, leaving other questions underexplored. kingma has made multiple novel contributions in this field over the last 7 years. 

 first, kingma has argued that **women have a near\-absolute right to refuse invasive medical procedures**, even if this choice results in the injury or death of another person, including their child \[ **3.1**\]. kingma has shown how this idea bears not only on the decision to refuse a caesarean section but also on many other more frequent but theoretically neglected choices, such as the choice of birthplace or whether to use a fetal heart monitor \[ **3.2**, **3.3**\]. 

 second, kingma has addressed **neglected questions about the duties of healthcare professionals** in caring for women who make ‘deviant’ birth choices. such choices may put healthcare professionals in potentially risky and stressful emergency situations, for which they are not adequately trained. kingma argues both that women are entitled to make such choices, and that professionals have a duty positively to assist with the chosen alternative. 

 third, kingma has argued that **there is a deep\-seated bias in many medical systems and cultures** that downplays or even ignores the risks women face during birth \[ **3.3, 3.4**\]. as a result, official guidance and policies are often driven by maximising outcomes for babies, giving insufficient weight to women’s health and well\-being. 

 fourth, kingma has tackled **questions about the underlying nature of pregnancy**. everyone agrees that the issues above are specific to the unique state of pregnancy and birth: there is no comparable debate about whether non\-consenting fathers could be *forced* to undergo invasive medical procedures, such as removal of their bone\-marrow or organs, for the sake of their children \[ **3.1**\]; or whether health care professionals have a duty to keep caring for jehovah’s witnesses who refuse a blood transfusion \[ **3.2**\]; and questions about which patient’s outcomes should be considered the main goal of a treatment simply do not arise in other medical contexts \[ **3.3, 3.4**\]. but despite its importance, the nature of pregnancy is little discussed in this ethical context. kingma’s ‘better understanding the metaphysics of pregnancy’ \(bump\) project was awarded a €1.2 million erc starting grant in 2016. this ongoing research argues: 

 \(i\) that **our thinking about pregnancy is dominated by an incorrect ‘fetal container model’** instead of a better ‘parthood view’ of pregnancy on which the fetus is part of the maternal organism \[ **3.5**\], and 

 \(ii\) that **this mistake fuels ethical mistakes**. for example, the fetal container model wrongly encourages us to apply notions such as “doing harm” to maternal\-fetal interactions. a better understanding of the nature of pregnancy demonstrates that such familiar moral concepts are at best difficult to apply, and at worst entirely inapplicable in this context \[ **3.6**\]. as a result, nearly all suboptimal choices by pregnant women, including smoking and drinking alcohol, might not qualify as “doing harm” \(even if they might nonetheless be wrong on independent grounds\). 

 kingma’s more theoretical research \[ **3.5**, **3.6**\] has been developed in conjunction with and often arising out of thinking about and working on more applied issues – and in turn, this more theoretical work on the nature of pregnancy, and an ethics appropriate to that nature, has shaped and affected her understanding of applied issues.

 in july 2013, a midwife was struck off for attending several ‘risky’ home births, in one of which the baby died. in each case, it was clear that the \(legally competent, reasonably informed\) parents would attempt the birth at home, with or without a midwife \[ **5.1 – 2013 case**\]. 

 that october kingma published an article, “tuchtzaak verloskundigen grote misser” \[“court case midwives big mistake”\], in *medisch contact,* the journal of the dutch medical association, criticising the judgment for being inconsistent, unfair, and unrealistic: women are entitled to decide not to go to hospital for birth, and they and their baby are entitled to medical assistance. this requires that health care professionals cannot be faulted for assisting with births under such imperfect circumstances. 

 during the appeal \(10 april 2014\), kingma’s article was submitted in full by the defence: “professor elselijn kingma has, in *medisch contact* dated october 3rd, 2013, placed the shortcomings of the contested decision in the correct perspective. prior to discussing the individual grounds on which we appeal, here is her article in full” \[ **5.2**\]. the judge overturned the original judgment in line with kingma’s reasoning: “the question is what the medical professional should do if a client persists in her refusal of a hospital delivery.\[…\] there is no doubt that the midwife has a right, and a duty, to do her work in the interest of mother and child in such an emergency situation”. the midwife was reinstated \[ **5.1 – 2014 appeal**\]. 

 this court case remains the landmark case on this matter, setting a legal precedent that changed subsequent practice. after the appeal midwives could feel secure about their legal standing when assisting with ‘risky’ home births \[ **5.3**\]. the legal precedent set by the appeal was confirmed in a 2018 court case about another midwife who attended a ‘risky’ home birth where the baby died. though the midwife was struck off, the court explicitly clarified that it was not the midwife’s attendance at a ‘risky’ home birth that was problematic, but instead other aspects of the case \(e.g. improper resuscitation practices\) \[ **5.1 – 2018 case**\]. 

 **4.2. critically shaping clinical guidelines** 

 the above court case, and more general questions about women making such choices, generated considerable upheaval, concern, and division amongst dutch midwives and gynaecologists. this motivated the dutch royal college of midwives \(knov\) and the dutch royal college of obstetrics and gynaecology \(nvog\) to develop formal guidance for professionals facing birth choices beyond the medical guidelines \[ **5.4**\]. kingma was the only philosopher/ethicist consulted in this process, first, by presenting at an initial invitation\-only workshop in october 2013, then by being selected to give a plenary presentation to all dutch gynaecologists on this topic in november 2013 \[ **5.3**, **5.5**\]. these processes ultimately resulted in the 2015 ratification of joint guidelines by the nvog and knov, which follow kingma's recommendations: respect women’s informed choices, even if those choices go against medical advice, and never leave women and babies without the best care they are willing to accept in the resulting situation \[ **5.3**, **5.5**\]. kingma’s work, both on the metaphysics of pregnancy, and the more applied ethical issues, made a crucial difference to these guidelines and in turn to subsequent practice \[ **5.3**, **5.5**\]. 

 **4.3. changing dutch government health policy** 

 in 2016, a new ‘integrated’ funding structure for gynaecologists and midwives was being considered in the netherlands. in response, kingma submitted a research\-based \[ **3.4**\] policy brief to the dutch government and mps \[ **5.6**\]; wrote op\-eds for a national newspaper \( *the volkskrant*, comparable to *the guardian*\) \[ **5.7**\], and the *dutch national midwifery journal* \[ **5.7**\]; and by invitation spoke at a public event – “de geboortezorg: een nieuw begin” \[“maternity care: a new start”\] – to approximately 200 attendees, including professionals and politicians. kingma argued that the proposed changes might impede women’s freedom of choice, and their health and wellbeing. this resulted in the following direct impact: 

-  an mp directly quoted kingma’s work in dutch parliament when arguing against the new policy \[ **5.8**\]. 

-  kingma’s words were also used in an invited submission by the charity *geboortebeweging* to the relevant parliamentary committee \[ **5.9**\]. 

 after these interventions, the government’s plans were changed: instead of a compulsory national implementation of the new system over two years, they instead opted for a two\-year optional pilot scheme, subject to subsequent evaluation. by invitation, kingma emailed expert advice to the ministry on how this pilot should be evaluated, so that it should measure outcomes not just for babies but also for mothers. the relevant body \(rivm\) has since included maternal outcomes and maternal freedom of choices among its performance indicators \[ **5.10**\]. 

 the change to a two\-year evaluable pilot has proven consequential – the two\-year evaluation shows mixed results and recommends further evaluation; no compulsory national implementation has followed so far \[ **5.11**\]. 

 **4.4a. influencing key decisions by charities: geboortebeweging** 

 *geboortebeweging* \(gb\) is the only dutch birth\-rights charity and is the key social partner in national policy discussions surrounding birth care. kingma is an important intellectual influence on their work, having collaborated with them continuously for the past 7 years as the only philosopher/ethicist involved. for example, by invitation, kingma has presented her research at multiple national gb events \[ **5.9**\]. she has also advised gb on their opinion pieces, policy submissions and press releases. in this way, kingma’s research has directly shaped gb’s response to health policy changes \(section 4.3, above\), the bravis case \(section 5, below\), and to changes and restrictions placed on pregnant and birthing women in response to the 2020 covid\-19 pandemic \[ **5.9**\]. 

 kingma’s collaboration with gb has been a two\-way exchange. kingma’s thinking and research have been enriched and shaped by her interaction with gb and with the women seeking advice on their rights via gb’s closed facebook page. vice versa, through both official and informal discussion, gb and its leaders have come to closely adopt the views developed and defended in kingma’s work \[ **5.3**, **5.9**\]. 

 **4.4b. influencing key decisions by charities: clara wichmann fund** 

 *clara wichmann fonds* \(cw\) is a dutch charity that funds landmark litigation furthering the legal rights of women. in 2014, the charity was considering whether to try to establish a clear legal precedent that women have a right to refuse medical intervention intended for their fetus’s benefit. kingma was invited \(as the only ethicist/philosopher\) to consult with the charity. at first, the committee was very unsure about this goal, worrying that women might in fact be under a moral and legal obligation to undergo some medical interventions for the sake of their fetus. but later, after kingma presented \(an early version\) of her research to the committee, they decided to try to establish a precedent for the right to refuse treatment, once a suitable case presented itself \[ **5.12**\]. this resulted in cw’s funding of the *bravis* case \(below\) *.* 

 **5. shaping discussion of the landmark bravis court case** 

 the *bravis* case \(march 2018\) was funded by clara wichmann fonds, and co\-litigated by geboortebeweging. *bravis* \(the name of the hospital\) concerned a pregnant woman with a previous caesarean section. she demanded a court order forcing the hospital to let her give birth on the midwife\-led ward \(rather than, following medical guidelines, the obstetric ward\), in water and without a fetal heart monitor \(again against hospital protocol\), and with her personal midwife who works in a different region \(and hence for a different regional ‘integrated birth care organisation’\). 

 the case is intricate and combines questions about women’s rights to refuse treatment and demand alternatives, questions about healthcare professionals’ duties to assist such women with \(less safe\) alternatives, and questions about the financial organisation of dutch birth care and how that impacts on women’s freedom, autonomy and health, and on hospitals and other autonomous health care providers \[ **5.6**\]. in short, it combines all the questions kingma has been working on with various stakeholders and in her research since 2013. kingma shaped the public and legal conversation surrounding the case in three primary ways. 

 first, kingma contributed to public discussion of the case, which received widespread media attention. kingma wrote research\-based articles for two quality national newspapers: trouw \(circulation: 102,631\) \[ **5.13**\] and nrc \(circulation: 136,000\) – comparable to *the independent* and *the times*. the op\-ed in trouw was the focus of the newspaper’s in\-house editorial \[ **5.13**\]. kingma also directly advised gb on its press contributions \[ **5.9**\]. 

 second, kingma continues to influence those pursuing the case. the initial case was lost, but this was expected: cw only takes cases that are expected to travel all the way to the supreme court. cw and gb are therefore preparing an appeal in collaboration with a law firm and a team of legal scholars and students at the university of amsterdam \(for whom this also doubles as a practical teaching exercise\). kingma has been closely involved, presenting her research to students and the lawyers, and providing detailed feedback on their drafts of the court order, which states the grounds and reasons for the appeal. this has changed the text of that document, as well as the underlying legal strategy pursued; instead of just focusing on a right to “personalised best care” \(as the academic lawyers advised\), the litigator is now pursuing a two\-pronged appeal that *also* pursues an argument that directly follows kingma’s research: an argument based on the combination of \(1\) a woman’s right to refuse certain interventions, and \(2\) her right to receive the best care available given those choices, even if this pushes healthcare professionals outside their ordinary professional boundaries \[ **5.9**, **5.12**\]. 

 **6. providing professional training for health and social workers** 

 third, by request, kingma has delivered training for the nvog and knov, and is revisiting the guidance for professionals on birth outside the guidelines. whereas the legal situation surrounding birth outside the guidelines seemed to have settled between 2015 and 2018, the bravis case complicated it again. the bravis case was widely interpreted as showing that healthcare professionals are only permitted, rather than required, to assist women with birth requests beyond the guidelines. as a result, some hospitals refused to provide ‘care outside the guidelines’ \[ **5.5**\]. consequently, kingma has been invited to train professionals for the nvog and knov on their moral obligation to provide such care at meetings and conferences \[ **5.14**\]. she is also consulting with the subcommittee of the nvog in charge of writing further clarifications for the guidelines, who plan to revise the guidelines in accordance with detailed verbal and written ethical analysis provided by kingma \[ **5.5**\]. kingma also provides research\-based training to other health\-care workers, such as social workers and others involved in the care of pregnant women with a substance addiction \[ **5.14**\].

2010,"
 **1. summary of the impact** 

 the university of bristol led confidential inquiry into premature deaths of people with learning disabilities \(cipold\), provided vital new evidence into both the numbers and causes of avoidable and premature deaths of people with learning disabilities in england. evidence and recommendations from cipold prompted reform of both health policy and practice in england including the establishment of a national mortality review programme, the first of its kind in the world. expansion of gp registers, a learning disabilities indicator, and a ‘reasonable adjustment flag’ system have increased identification of patients with learning disabilities and contributed to a 12% increase in annual health checks and an increase in flu vaccinations. 
","
 **2. underpinning research** 

 longstanding concerns about the care of people with learning disabilities within the nhs were brought into focus in 2007 with mencap’s ‘death by indifference’ report, and a subsequent independent inquiry in 2010, which recommended the urgent need to understand the extent of the problem of premature deaths and establish guidance on prevention. the confidential inquiry into the deaths of people with learning disabilities \(cipold\) \(2010\-2013\) \[1\] was commissioned from university of bristol \(uob\) by the department of health \[i\] and led by prof pauline heslop. 

 cipold investigated the deaths of 247 people with disabilities and 58 matched comparator cases \(people without learning disabilities but similar in age, gender, geographical location etc\), over a two\-year period in one region of england. the inquiry developed a unique methodology to reviewing deaths that took account of multiple health and care service providers as well as the family carers’ perspectives. each review included collation, analysis and synthesis of core data, case note reviews, individual interviews with family members, a panel meeting of all those involved in supporting the deceased and external anonymous scrutiny by an overview panel \[1\]. 

 the inquiry provided robust research evidence of the significant reduction in life expectancy, 13 and 20 years for men and women respectively, for people with learning disabilities compared to the general population. ‘avoidable’ deaths from causes amenable to change by good quality health care were more common in people with intellectual disabilities \(37%\) than in the general population of england and wales \(13%\).the most common reasons for premature deaths were revealed to be delays or problems with diagnosis or treatment, often associated with the lack of provision of ‘reasonable adjustments’ for their care, and problems with identifying needs and providing appropriate care in response to changing needs, particularly in cases of a deteriorating condition. the findings and 18 recommendations were published in a report to government \[1\], and subsequently in *the lancet* \[2\]. 

 a subsequent study by prof heslop with academic colleagues at public health england \(phe\) linked data from gp registers of people with learning disabilities with english mortality data \[4\]. this nationally representative linked data confirmed the findings of cipold and highlighted the disparity in life expectancy between people with learning disabilities and the general population as 19.7 years \[4\]. similar disparities were identified by heslop and co\-authors for the usa \[5\]. 

 cipold research also identified concerns about the coding used for underlying cause of death on medical certificates of cause of death \(mccd\), which were echoed nationally and internationally \[6\]. the research highlighted inaccuracies in the coding of routinely collected data, such that it was difficult to extract accurate national data on the age and causes of death of people with learning disabilities. this has led to national and international work to understand ‘hidden’ causes of premature and avoidable death.

#  reform of health and social care policy in england 

 the government response to the cipold report \[1\] agreed that *“much more still needs to be done to ensure people with learning disabilities have the same rights and access to the same health benefits as the rest of the population”* \(p.2\). 

 launching *the lancet* paper \(december 2013\) \[2\], prof heslop criticised the lack of urgency in acting on the recommendations in the cipold report \[1\]. pressure from mencap and the health service ombudsman was followed by a strongly critical lords debate which drew extensively on cipold findings. a delayed department of health progress report \[a\] summarised action taken on each of the cipold recommendations \( *r*\) and confessed that *“…we now need to step up the pace and make a concerted national effort”* \[a\] *.* key initiatives included: a commitment to increasing annual health checks \( *r6*\), bmi checks and cancer screening \( *r7*\); targeting people with learning disability for flu immunisation \(cipold showed they were more vulnerable to respiratory disease \[1\]\); improving access to palliative care; and improving adherence to the mental capacity act \( *r15*\) \[a\]. significantly, the government committed to the cipold recommendation \( *r18*\) to establish a learning disability mortality review body \(leder\). this was delivered by uob \[ii\] and commissioned for five years \(2015\-2020\) by the healthcare quality improvement partnership \(hqip\) on behalf of nhs england, and directly by nhs england from 2020\-2021. 

 since 2014, there have been five debates in the lords and eight in the commons which have discussed cipold or leder. in 2016, the secretary of state announced that the leder programme would provide support to families and all local nhs areas in england to enable reporting and an independent, standardised review of all learning disability deaths \[ci\]. in 2018 the minister for care, responding to the first leder report \[bi\], announced a new legal requirement for every nhs trust in england to publish data on avoidable deaths and provide evidence of learning and improvements \( *r17*\), and a learning disability annual health checks scheme \( *r6*\) was introduced to help ensure that undiagnosed health conditions can be identified early \[cii\]. 

 a leder recommendation on the need for better training and awareness of learning disability in the health and social care sector \( *r6* \[bii\]\), was recognised in the government’s response to the consultation on learning disability and autism training for health and social care staff \[d\]. the government subsequently proposed to amend the health and social care act 2008 \(regulated activities\) regulations 2014 accordingly \(para 79\), with planned changes coming into force in april 2021 \[d\]. health education england and skills for care are now co\-ordinating the development of the training in health and social care. 

 the cipold \[1, 2\] and leder \[bi\-iii\] reports have presented uncomfortable findings and challenges. nevertheless, in the preface to the government’s response to the 3<sup>rd</sup> leder report \[biii\], the minister wrote: “ *the university of bristol has played a hugely important role since the beginning of the leder programme, setting out the learning and recommendations from the leder reviews in their annual reports. we are grateful for the significant contribution they have made*.”  the minister continued, *“i… reiterate our ongoing commitment to the mortality reviews themselves being undertaken as set out in the nhs's long term plan \[2019\]”* \[e\]. 

#  learning from mortality reviews in england 

 leder is the world’s first national programme of mortality reviews of people with learning disabilities aged 4 years and over.  more than 5,000 deaths of people with learning disabilities have now been reviewed: in 2018 this was 86% of the estimated number of deaths of people with learning disabilities in england that year. three annual reports have been published by the university of bristol identifying key learning and making recommendations to the nhs and social care sector \[bi\-iii\].  the case record review methodology developed by cipold \[1\] and adapted for use by leder has been recognised by, and recommended for use in, the national *learning from deaths programme* \[f\] which requires a leder review of *‘all in\-patient, out\-patient and community patient deaths of those with learning disabilities’* \[f\]. 

 a *learning into action* collaborative was established by the nhs england and nhs improvement learning disability programme to co\-ordinate the national response to learning from leder. it involved nhs trusts, social care, charities and the independent sector, practitioners, people with a learning disability and their families. the collaborative’s work was guided by recommendations made in the 2018 and 2019 uob leder reports \[biii, biv\]. work streams have tackled respiratory problems, sepsis, constipation, cancer, the failure to recognise physical deterioration and the application of the mental capacity act \[g\]. the most recent action from learning report \[gii\] demonstrates impact for people with learning disabilities in relation to improvements to cancer screening services, the development of a reasonable adjustment ‘flag’ on case records, the use of the news2 \(national early warning score\) to improve the detection and response to clinical deterioration, changes to the flu vaccination eligibility criteria to include all people with learning disabilities, the provision of advice to trusts about dnacpr \(do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation\) decisions, and improvements to the nhs111 service \[gii\]. most recently \(nov 2020\), findings of leder reviews of deaths from covid\-19 have been presented to the government scientific advisory group for emergencies \(sage\). nhs action from learning have responded to these data with specific actions for gp practices, as well as health and care organisations \[giii\]. 

#  changes to nhs policy 

 cipold \[1\] was instrumental in nhs england acknowledging premature mortality of people with learning disabilities as an area of concern and was identified as a key priority in the 2019 nhs long term plan \[hi\], as well as the nhs operational planning and contracting guidance \(2019/20\) and the learning disability improvement standards for nhs trusts \(2018\). having a learning disability is not a cause of death. cipold identified concerns about the coding used for underlying cause of death on mccds \[6\]. leder reiterated these concerns \[b\] and in response the national medical director for nhs england wrote to nhs trusts and clinical commissioning groups reminding them that the terms ‘learning disability’ and ‘down syndrome’ should never be used to describe the underlying, or only, cause of death on the mccd \[hii\]. 

#  improved identification of people with learning disabilities and their needs 

 cipold \[1, 2\] recommended identification of people with learning disabilities in health and social care settings \( *r1*\) so that practitioners make ‘ *reasonable adjustments’* to ensure that services are fully accessible and meet their needs \( *r2*\). furthermore, these reasonable adjustments should be recorded, implemented and audited \( *r2*\). in response, gp registers of people with learning disabilities were expanded from adult\-only to all\-age registers and form the basis for annual learning disability health checks included in the *general medical services contract 2014/15* \[ii\] *.* 

 nhs england and nhs digital, with input from the uob, developed a ‘reasonable adjustment flag’ to add to a person’s health record on the nhs spine to inform health and care staff when an adjustment to services needs to be made. this is currently being piloted, pending national implementation, to gather feedback from staff, patients and carers about the impact on care when information is readily available to staff from the first point of contact onward \[iii\]. 

#  healthcare benefits for patients with learning disabilities 

 in 2019, nhs digital reported indicators of health promotion activities recommended by cipold and leder and adopted by the nhs england \[j\]. notably, the proportion of people with learning disabilities receiving an annual health check \( *r6*\) has increased from 43% \(2014/15\) to 55% \(2017/18\) and bmi assessments increased from 58% to 62% in the same period \[j\]. this is important because they are more likely to be obese \(30%\) than those without learning disability \(23%\) \[1, 2\]. the proportion of people with learning disabilities receiving a flu vaccination \( *r9*\) has risen from 40.8% to 44.7% \(2014/15 to 2017/18\); 83% of those over 75 had been vaccinated \[j\]. rates of cancer screening were lower for people with learning disability than those without, e.g. for breast cancer 53% vs 68%, and for colorectal cancer 78% vs. 84%, although 78% was an increase from 67% in 2014\-5. there had been a 60% increase in the proportion of patients with learning disabilities receiving palliative care at end of life; more than those without learning disabilities at all age bands \[j\].

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 poor management and maintenance of social housing has well\-evidenced negative impacts on the health and wellbeing of social housing tenants. lse housing and communities’ research illustrating the effectiveness of tenant\-focused neighbourhood management has influenced providers to engage and empower local tenants and residents to deliver the better management of their estates. this has also included facilitating tenant input into enforcement on fire safety regulations, crime, and anti\-social behaviour. this has been enabled through the efforts of the housing plus academy – an academic/service provider/professional association partnership spearheaded by lse housing and communities since 2015. it has reached over 1,500 tenants, housing providers, and local and central government officials through residential training and workshops. a body of research led by professor anne power has been influential in driving forward operational best practices among social housing providers and advising national government. it has: 

1.  prompted social housing providers to: \(i\) give tenants a voice and ability to participate in decisions about their estates, including in relation to fire safety; and \(ii\) implement neighbourhood management practices. 

1.  informed uk government consultation, strategy, and policy development. 

1.  guided social housing landlords to foster new community actions tackling inequality and promoting community resilience in times of austerity. 
","
###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 there are currently around one and half million people \(tenants and owners\) living in high\-rise, council\-built flats. lse housing and communities has conducted qualitative research with social housing tenants and leaseholders living in blocks of flats in multi\-storey estates around the country. this involves gathering residents’ experiences and views, developing plans for estate upgrading, and collecting messages which are shared with landlords and professional bodies. most recently this approach was brought to the urgent need to learn lessons from the 2017 grenfell fire disaster **\[1\]**. this research drew on many years of prior research, described below, which had found that tenants and leaseholders wish and need to be respected, listened to, informed, and to count as equal\-status partners with their social housing landlords. in the grenfell context, the specific findings were that there was a need for on\-site management, a single point of control for all high\-rise buildings, an mot\-equivalent test for multi\-storey blocks, and an approach of drawing on the lived experience of all residents within blocks. in particular, this includes the need to engage residents in the enforcement of safety regulations relating to the risks of fire, crime, and anti\-social behaviour. 

 the previous research and advocacy spans three decades. within the ref research period, investigation of conditions in poor neighbourhoods identified the key drivers of poor outcomes for residents – those outcomes including disrepair, fuel poverty, low energy efficiency, unsuitable housing management, and a lack of empowerment. power’s review of ten years of government programmes focused on improving poor neighbourhoods **\[2\]** shows that neighbourhood management – a coordinated and localised effort to tackle basic area conditions and environments – delivers measurable improvements in outcomes that can restore confidence, encourage investment, and signal wider progress, outperforming different approaches in comparable areas. significant rises in resident satisfaction were also seen. the cost of organising this additional layer of supervision was relatively modest. it pays for itself in reduced vandalism and disrepair, and generates a form of self\-policing by making streets and open spaces people\-friendly again, attracting people and activities back. complementary qualitative analysis from 1,400 in\-depth interviews over 10 years with 200 families bringing up children in difficult neighbourhoods in east london and northern england **\[3\]** provided longitudinal qualitative evidence around specific aspects of the impact of neighbourhood renewal and management, community cohesion, and empowerment. it documented views on why community matters, schools as community anchors, crime, safety and prevention, family ill\-health, work, training and benefits, and housing and regeneration. positive impacts included involving families with children in shaping neighbourhood activities, delivering programmes and services at a local scale, and responding quickly to the minutiae of neighbourhood problems. at the same time, problems included that many parents felt a lack of control and an inability to escape the problems of the area due to underlying inequality and a lack of housing options. additional recent work has explored the stigmatisation of social housing tenants **\[4\]**. 

 wider work across six european countries **\[5\]** evidenced the effectiveness of local leadership, community enterprise, resident involvement and training, and local control of housing and neighbourhood conditions in aiding community and city regeneration and wellbeing. this approach was shown to be useful in large cities such as birmingham **\[6\]**, and to address the pressing issue of climate change **\[7\]**. this research has enabled an input into policy development among professionals and in government and helped residents and community activists living in those high\-rise blocks to take local action.

###  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 lse housing and communities’ research has generated impacts in three main areas relating to tenant voice and participation, operational practices and service provision, and influencing local and national government strategies and policies: 

 **\(1\) prompting social housing providers to: \(i\) give residents a voice and ability to participate in decisions about their estates, including in relation to fire safety; and \(ii\) implement neighbourhood management practices** 

 lse housing and communities’ housing plus academy has been running residential workshops, policy think tanks, and publishing reports since 2015 **\[a\] \[b\]**. these events involve front\-line staff, social housing tenants, senior decision\-makers, government, and third\-sector organisations who debate and explore issues led and facilitated by lse housing and communities. events are based on lse research evidence and recommendations, and serve to operationalise, challenge, extend, and implement that material. the academy is funded by 17 leading housing associations, and partners include the national housing federation and the chartered institute of housing, the main professional and coordinating bodies for social housing. over 1,500 participants have attended 40 housing academy residential think tanks and several one\-day workshops in the last five years. good practice and conclusions from each event are widely shared with social landlords and government, feeding tenants’ and staff perspectives into high\-level policy and operational decisions. 

 in terms of providing safe and decent homes following the grenfell tower fire disaster, lse housing and communities ran a bespoke programme funded by direct line in 2017\-18, which informed the *lessons from grenfell* report **\[1\]**. this included running knowledge\-exchange workshops for tenants, social landlords, government, architects, fire service, and other stakeholders living, working, and managing high\-rise residential buildings. as part of the *lessons from grenfell* programme, lse housing and communities ran a residential workshop for residents from the nearby lancaster west estate, where grenfell is located. the workshop galvanised clear ideas on developing local housing management \(building on the earlier work referenced above\) and estate\-wide upgrading. 

 neighbourhood management was then also implemented on the lancaster west estate, following principles advocated during the workshop. this has led to significant positive change for residents, including greater satisfaction with repairs, energy\-saving works as a feature of estate upgrading, and better communication between residents and royal borough of kensington and chelsea staff. these findings are supported by central government officials: “ *the local estate management team, with neighbourhood managers and locally recruited repairs team, set up on your advice, has started to get on top of local repairs. its visible presence, combined with a willingness to listen and respond quickly has, i am told, gone down well with local residents \[and is\] a model social housing estate for the 21st century. i would appreciate your ongoing input”* **\[c\]**. lse housing and communities’ work with the royal borough of kensington and chelsea *“has been critical in helping them to start re\-building trust and improve their local relationships following the grenfell fire tragedy”* \(head of housing investment and regeneration, ministry of housing, communities and local government \(mhclg\)\) **\[c\]**. 

 housing associations such as notting hill genesis, riverside, home, l&q, and clarion have intensified their efforts to introduce a return to frontline management services, including repairs. following a march 2017 cpd course on the need for frontline housing management \- developed and delivered by lse housing and communities, backed by the chartered institute of housing, and attended by staff from 29 housing associations \- a senior government participant noted: “ *attending the workshop meant i was able to cover…neighbourhood management and professionalization as a proposal in the social housing green paper”* **\[c\]**. 

 another key audience for the research is providers and developers of social housing. the president of the royal institute of british architects comments that power’s work has “ *raise\[d\] the profile of social housing, the need for community representation and voice, the importance of neighbourhood management and improving the quality of services”*. the chief executive of l&q housing association \(one of the uk’s largest\) has commented: “ *the unique experience and expertise of lse offers a powerful opportunity to listen, adapt and improve*” **\[c\]**. 

 lse housing and communities secured funding from nationwide foundation and l&q for three learning events about developing community\-led and community\-based homes. these were in 2018 and 2019 and attracted around 150 participants from across the uk. the aim was to aid and develop participants’ access to the government’s community housing fund and l&q’s own small housing associations development scheme. the core aim of the initiatives is to develop small\-scale housing that is attuned to local community needs. l&q are now partnering with small housing associations across london to develop 1,000 homes by 2022 by unlocking “small sites” using gbp100 million from l&q and gbp80 million from the greater london authority **\[d\]**. 

 **\(2\) informed uk government consultation, strategy, and policy development** 

 the work on the *lessons from grenfell* programme \(power 2020, above\) was “ *helpful in the development of policy at mhclg. in practice, the lessons from grenfell have been increasingly reflected in the social housing green paper”* \(head of social housing safety, decency and climate change, mhclg\) **\[c\]**. the recommendations from the research \(see above\) were adopted by government and subsequently featured in *the guardian* and on the *british politics and policy at lse* blog **\[e\]**. they influenced many aspects of government policy, including the landlord responsibility for all aspects of multi\-storey block safety, including structural issues, design, construction, fire safety, resident communication, maintenance, and supervision. specifically, they: 

-  helped shape the *hackitt review on building regulations* **\[f\]** and the *grenfell inquiry phase 1* report **\[g\]**. this reviewed building regulations, and government policy towards high\-rise blocks, their management and maintenance. 

-  led government to endorse listening to tenants, advocate a single point of control for high\-rise blocks, and to require technical expertise and hands\-on management for all multi\-storey blocks. this was recommended in the *grenfell inquiry phase 1 report* and has now been implemented by government. 

 lse housing and communities had a direct influence on the 2018 green paper, *a new deal for social housing* **\[h\]**, and the subsequent white paper **\[i\]**, particularly around proposals for greater community cohesion and empowerment, and neighbourhood management. research by power and provan provided advice for the mhclg on the development of guidelines for tenant involvement, particularly with regard to the stigma of social housing. promoting neighbourhood management as the leading model of social housing delivery, the deputy director of social housing at mhclg noted that “ *\[t\]he green paper has reflected a number of the key issues we have discussed with anne and explored through the \[housing plus\] academy*”, and also noted that “ *anne’s influence, using the housing plus academy, has been considerable… she has been invited in by me and other senior civil servants to meetings among government officials including with the housing minister, in order to develop ideas on a number of areas*” **\[c\]**. the mhclg head of housing investment and regeneration said: “ *in particular, the strong emphasis we placed on the role of residents in shaping a future for their estate and the need for sustainability and ongoing management to be central to any plans reflected the contributions made and evidence presented by \[the lse housing and communities\] team*” **\[c\]**. the ministerial foreword to the green paper states that “ *it represents one of the most important steps we can take to reaffirm housing as this country’s first social service – for everyone”* **\[h\]** *.* this focus was confirmed in the social housing white paper, *the charter for social housing residents,* published in november 2020, where the pm’s foreword noted: “ *we’re levelling up this country, making it fairer for everyone – and that includes making sure social housing tenants are treated with the respect they deserve”* **\[i\]**. 

 power has also been a constant source of related advice to government, including as an independent expert on mhclg’s feeling safer board, assessing what helps high\-rise tenants feel safer in their homes \(2018\-present\); academic advisor to the troubled families programme \(2015\-present\); and advisor on the development of the government’s *estate regeneration national strategy* \(2016\) **\[j\]** where lse housing and communities research and recommendations were cited as good practice. the head of housing investment and regeneration at mhclg noted that they “ *valued \[lse’s\] advice and guidance as \[they\] put together a new strategy for estate regeneration at the end of 2016”* **\[c\]**. 

 **\(3\) guiding social housing landlords to foster new community actions tackling inequality and promoting community resilience in times of austerity** 

 the 2019 *housing plus academy impact report* **\[b\]** showed that all but one of its policy think tank participants had made changes to their organisation as a result of attending. examples included: attendees introducing a hardship fund to help people struggling with the move to universal credit after a welfare benefits workshop, and establishing a tenant scrutiny panel with local powers to determine operational priorities. 

 an evaluation of outcomes of 24 think tanks organised through the housing plus academy **\[k\]** indicated attendees had used the learning to bring about new community actions. one of the main reported benefits was an increase in confidence and motivation to take forward their ideas, as well as providing networking opportunities with other community groups to share best practice and learn from each other. for example, a liverpool tenants’ group that attended the workshop runs a very successful scrutiny panel holding the landlord to account. other participating groups went on to visit the liverpool group to learn from their experience and see first\-hand how they ran their scrutiny panel and why it was so successful. the evaluation revealed the average number of people helped per project was 198, with each project attracting on average 15 additional community volunteers. the average yearly cash value of each volunteer’s work contribution \(at minimum wage\) is estimated to be gbp8,844 **\[k\]**.

###  1. summary of the impact 

 communication through language plays a central part in the experience of illness and the provision of healthcare. by applying computer\-aided discourse analysis to the study of language use in healthcare communication, lancaster researchers have achieved significant improvements in the following areas: 

-  diagnosis and support for chronic pain sufferers – by training over 1,000 pain clinicians to make better use of a language\-based diagnostic questionnaire, and preventing cessation of support for approximately 1,000 patients through an evidential argument to maintain the online forum of the trigeminal neuralgia association uk \(tna\). 

-  communication about cancer – supporting health practitioners in the uk, mexico, south africa and denmark to better communicate with cancer patients by creating a ‘metaphor menu for people living with cancer’ \(available through cancer research uk’s website\) and in applying it in cancer care settings. 

-  use of patients’ online feedback on nhs services – by upskilling the patient feedback team at nhs england through research\-informed training, with benefits for all nhs users in england. 

-  more generally, the research has increased awareness of how to achieve sensitive and effective communication about illness, particularly cancer, by reaching over 10 million people via print, broadcast and online media outlets, in the uk and internationally \(e.g., spain, usa and canada\). 
","
###  2. underpinning research 

 large\-scale analyses of communication for, by and about different stakeholders in healthcare \(patients, family carers, healthcare professionals\) were conducted through 3 ukri\-funded projects in the esrc centre for corpus approaches to social science \(cass\) at lancaster university \[g1, g2, g3\]. cass is internationally known for cutting\-edge research in corpus linguistics \(the computer\-aided study of large collections of texts known as ‘corpora’\) and its practical applications. in 2015, cass was awarded a queen’s anniversary prize for further and higher education. cass members are regularly commissioned by individuals and organisations in the healthcare sector to investigate communication\-related questions or problems, and this facilitates the impact of the centre’s research. the 3 research foci described below concern urgent and challenging areas of healthcare communication around chronic pain, cancer and patient feedback on nhs services. the research was carried out through collaborations involving lancaster university linguists \(baker, brookes, demjén, demmen, hardie, koller, mcenery, semino\), a computer scientist \(rayson\), a healthcare researcher \(payne\), together with an nhs healthcare practitioner \(zakrzewska\) and stakeholder organisations \(notably, the tna, cancer research uk, and nhs england\). 

 <ins> **communication about chronic pain in clinical and non\-clinical settings**</ins> 

 between 2012 and 2019, hardie and semino employed corpus linguistic methods to investigate the use of language in pain diagnosis, and amongst interactions on the trigeminal neuralgia association’s \(tna\) online patient forum. following a request from a consultant in facial pain at eastman dental hospital, london, a general english study was carried out on the usage of the 78 linguistic pain descriptors included in the mcgill pain questionnaire \(mpq\) – a widely used language\-based diagnostic tool for pain \(translated into 26 languages\). the results of the linguistic analysis were then correlated with 800 patients’ responses to the mpq. following a request from the tna, the language used on the association’s online patient forum was analysed systematically. key findings were as follows: 

-  the mpq does not provide reliable evidence for one of the two aspects of pain it aims to measure, namely, pain intensity \[r1\]. 

-  the tna online forum provides an important source of emotional and social support for its members \[r2\]. 

 <ins> **metaphors in communication about cancer</ins> <ins>and the end of life</ins>** 

 between 2012 and 2018, a novel corpus\-based approach was employed by demjén, demmen, hardie, koller, payne, rayson and semino to evidence any potential harm associated with controversial ‘violence’ metaphors for cancer \(e.g., ‘my battle against cancer’\) and identify any benefits associated with ‘journey’ metaphors \(e.g., ‘my cancer journey’\), the latter having been adopted by the nhs since 2007 \[g2\]. the team studied metaphors used to describe the experience of cancer and the end of life in a 1.5 million word corpus, consisting of interviews, online forum posts by patients with incurable cancer, unpaid family carers and healthcare professionals. key findings were as follows: 

-  ‘violence’ metaphors appeared most frequently in the data, and particularly in the language used by patients, with ‘journey’ metaphors being the second most frequently used type. 

-  ‘violence’ metaphors can make patients feel anxious, guilty and inadequate, especially when the illness is incurable \(as suggested by approximately 40% of occurrences\), but they are empowering for some patients. ‘journey’ metaphors do not appear to have potentially harmful effects \(e.g., they do not generate feelings of guilt for not getting better\), but can also be both empowering and disempowering, depending on who uses them and how \(e.g., stage of disease and specific choice of linguistic expression\). 

-  other types of metaphors \(e.g., involving fairground rides, sports, nature, music\) can provide useful alternative perspectives on the experience of cancer \[r3, r4\]. 

 <ins> **online</ins> <ins>patient</ins> <ins>feedback</ins> <ins>about</ins> <ins>nhs services**</ins> 

 the nhs receives a large volume of free\-text online feedback via its nhs choices website, which they found hard to analyse. in 2016, baker was commissioned by nhs england to identify, with assistance from brookes and mcenery, the key drivers for positive and negative feedback in a 29 million word corpus consisting of comments posted between 2013 and 2015. key findings were: 

-  nhs services were evaluated positively approximately 3 times more often than negatively. 

-  treatment exhibited the highest proportion of positive evaluative comments \(87%\), followed by communication \(77%\), interpersonal skills \(44%\) and system/organisation \(41%\). 

-  staff members were much more likely to be evaluated both positively and negatively according to their interpersonal skills. 

-  mismatches between patient expectations and actual staff roles were often an underlying driver of positive or negative feedback \[r5, r6\]. 

 overall, cass research has revealed both problems to be addressed and opportunities to be exploited in how language is used to diagnose patients and to convey experiences of illness and healthcare. the findings are particularly relevant to improving patients’ experiences of common and/or serious conditions such as chronic pain and cancer, and to drawing maximum benefit from the availability of unprecedentedly large amounts of patient feedback.

 cass’s corpus\-based research on health communication has influenced professional practice and understanding, and improved the experience of patients as a result of close collaborations with healthcare professionals and stakeholder organisations. regular coverage of the research in the national and international media has also ensured that the general public are now increasingly aware of how to sensitively handle communications around healthcare.

 cass research on pain\-related data has \(a\) improved the processes by which clinicians diagnose pain \[r1\], and \(b\) prevented the cessation of support \(via the tna’s online patient forum\) for people living with trigeminal neuralgia \[r2\]. since 2014, approximately 1,000 pain clinicians have been trained through research\-informed workshops and cpd events \(e.g., at the british and european pain societies and the royal society of medicine\) to modify, for the first time, their interpretation of patients’ responses to the mpq based on the research findings concerning its limited ability to assess pain intensity reliably – a previously unidentified problem. further, amidst reports of the spread of misinformation, cass’s evidence and recommendations provided in \[r2\] galvanised the tna into reversing its decision to close down its online patient forum in 2014. the forum has remained open for the benefit of approximately 1,000 current users, and remains open indefinitely to future patients. evidence collected through analyses of approximately 2 million words from the forum include comments such as: “ *you will find a wealth of support and advice on here, this has been my lifeline*”; “ *this forum is brilliant for getting support from others who know what you are going through*”; “ *talking here helps me so much*” \[s1\]. 

 <ins> **improving communication about cancer</ins> <ins>and the end of life,</ins> <ins>for patients, healthcare professionals, charities**</ins> 

 prior to the research, claims and guidelines about useful or harmful metaphors for cancer and the end of life were not based on large\-scale evidence from language use. the findings of cass corpus\-based research in this area have influenced communication practices in clinical settings and the media, and directly benefited people with cancer and those who support them \[r3, r4, s2\-s9\]. since 2014, the research on \(dis\)empowering uses of metaphors has been disseminated to more than 1000 healthcare professionals in the nhs, hospices and staff at cancer and end\-of\-life charities through workshops, training events and many more through media engagement. as a result, feedback suggests the majority of professionals have reconsidered and refined their communicative practices and training provision. feedback from a 2014 training session at st joseph’s hospice, london for 30 people \(specialists in cancer care and end\-of\-life care\) showed how engagement with the research will influence practice: “ *will help with my area of care, will help me understand and think about what my patients and relatives are actually telling me. will make me reflect and respond more appropriately”*. feedback from staff training sessions at st john’s hospice, lancaster with 70 people \(specialists in cancer care and end\-of\-life care\) between 2017 and 2019 showed 100% of  participants opted for ‘strongly agree’ or ‘agree’ in response to the statement: ‘the session was relevant and useful to me’ \[s2\]. after another user\-engagement event, palliative care nurse and former head of research at hospice uk, the national charity for hospice care in the uk, attested: “ *your work has influenced my professional practice as a nurse, researcher, educator and human being*” \[s3\]. a palliative care physician and former clinical director at hospice uk posted tweets that showed the influence of the research on her thinking and practices: ” *heightened alertness to metaphor when talking to patients* *since today’s session\!*”; “ *am listening in a new way\!\!”*’ \(2014\) and “ *i have learnt from your work that different metaphors suit different people”* \(2019\) \[s3; see also s4 for impact on end\-of\-life care practitioners\]. the senior brand manager at macmillan cancer research has described lancaster research as ‘incredibly useful’ \[s5a\]\), and the science media officer at cancer research uk wrote that “\[the research\] *is often referenced by the brand team”* \[s5b\]. 

 a resource for patients \- the  ['metaphor menu for people living with cancer'](http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/melc/the-metaphor-menu/) \- was launched in november 2019, based on a key finding that different people benefit from different metaphors for the cancer experience \[r4\]. the metaphor menu is an illustrated collection of 17 quotes providing alternative metaphors for living with cancer, and was created with input from cancer patients and staff from st. john’s hospice and cancer care in lancaster. it is available  [online](http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/melc/the-metaphor-menu/), as a leaflet and as a pack of cards. launch events were attended by patients, healthcare professionals and charity volunteers in lancaster and london. feedback from the ceo of north west cancer research attending the event stated: *“really useful. so many more different ways to talk about and understand a big and often frightening subject. we'll use this to re\-consider how we talk about cancer*”; and another attendee “ *as a previous cancer patient and the daughter of a cancer patient i feel so relieved that i needn't force myself to always fight with it. i can just live with it in balance. cancer is a partner \- sometimes we are together, sometimes we separate from each other.*”  shortly after the launch, the european association for palliative care published the metaphor menu on their  [blog](https://eapcnet.wordpress.com/2019/11/20/a-metaphor-menu-for-people-living-with-cancer/), reaching approximately 170 countries, and @pallimed \(a twitter account representing us hospice and palliative care professionals with approximately 14,000 followers\) tweeted a link to the metaphor menu with the comment: “ *love the*  [<ins> *\#metaphormenu*</ins>](https://twitter.com/hashtag/metaphormenu?src=hashtag_click) *for cancer and it can be applied to any serious illness. let's have more choices than 'battle' metaphors. let people pick the one that resonates with them”*. in early 2020, patient testimonies on the usefulness of the metaphor menu were included in an  [article](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-language-of-cancer-fighting-beating-going-on-a-journey-here-are-some-alternative-descriptions-those-with-cancer-prefer-to-use_uk_5e273388c5b674e44b9ef333) published by the *huffington post uk* and in a *bbc radio 4*  [broadcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0001g8w). as of december 2020, the metaphor menu page had been visited approximately 3,700 times; an online evaluative questionnaire shows that, since november 2019, 25 people \(healthcare professionals/cancer patients\) have rated the metaphor menu at an average of 4.1 on a 5\-point scale for usefulness. cancer research uk recommends the metaphor menu as a patient resource on their  [website](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/general-books-links/general-reading-list) \[s6\]. it has been included in a self\-reflection toolkit for 20 women with breast cancer in the uk, developed by the innovation advisor at imperial college health partners \[s7a\] and is being used in patient support sessions and by trainers of health professionals in mexico, south africa and denmark \[s7b\]. 

 the research into communication about cancer, particularly with regard to avoiding disempowering metaphors, has also reached the public through worldwide media coverage: *the independent*, *the times*, *the daily mail*, *time*, *new york times* blog, *the vancouver sun*, *new scientist*, *vice canada*, *new york magazine*, *il sole 24 ore* blog and *el pais*. the research is often referenced when media controversies over metaphors relating to the illness of a prominent person arise. for example, semino’s work was cited on  [*nbc news*](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/john-mccain-did-not-lose-his-battle-glioblastoma-because-cancer-ncna904486) and in the  [*washington examiner*](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/stop-saying-john-mccain-will-beat-cancer-because-hes-a-fighter) following the death of us senator john mccain \(2018\), and referenced in a  [*youtube video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qrdssmj_vk) by us clinician and communication consultant bruce lambert following us tv presenter’s alex trebek’s cancer announcement \(2019\) \[s8\]. cumulatively, the insights provided by the research are likely to have touched the lives of millions of patients worldwide. 

 the reach of this research focus goes beyond communication about cancer. in spring 2020, the lancaster approach to metaphors for cancer inspired an international initiative for effective metaphor use in communication about the covid\-19 pandemic, \#reframecovid. as part of this initiative, the findings from cass research on the most and least appropriate metaphors to be used in public communication about the pandemic have been reported in, amongst others, the  [*daily mail*](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-8200153/tankers-football-comebacks-green-shoots--just-don-t-mention-covid-19-war.html),  [*der spiegel*](https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/corona-pandemie-linguisten-finden-die-perfekte-metapher-fuer-die-ausbreitung-a-64f72e88-ec98-4bd5-acc7-e642a949c2c5), and the  [*atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/10/trump-strength-coronavirus/616682/) magazine. the influence of the research goes even beyond healthcare; the metaphor menu has inspired the adoption of a similar approach by the president of the international coaching federation \(germany\) and director of solutions academy, who confirms “the idea behind metaphor menus is very applicable in my field of coaching and coach training… by becoming aware of whether the metaphors we inadvertently use are serving us or whether an alternative metaphor or alternative metaphors might not be serving us better, coaches can help clients create more choices and different perspectives for themselves” \[s9\]. 

 <ins> **upskilling nhs staff, to m</ins><ins>aximis</ins><ins>e</ins> <ins>the use of patient feedback</ins> <ins>about</ins> <ins>nhs services**</ins> 

 prior to working with cass, the patient feedback team at nhs england largely relied on quantitative numeric data to analyse and understand what patients thought about nhs services; they considered the techniques they had previously used to analyse free\-text responses to be inadequate. the research commissioned to cass remedied this situation. following a report on the findings of the research, in 2015 nhs england commissioned an instructional video with accompanying written training materials, which were made available on the staff intranet to its 6,500 employees. these new resources have enabled the feedback team to use corpus linguistic software independently in the analysis of patient feedback, in perpetuity. as a consequence, the care quality commission stipulated that any new software for textual feedback analysis is compatible with the tools developed in cass, so that the training provided by the team continues to be relevant to their exploration of patients’ feedback. the corpus\-based approach was endorsed as “ *the most sophisticated \[they\] had seen”*, while a senior research manager at nhs england testified: “ *this has been particularly useful and has helped develop our knowledge and understanding of textual analysis methods”* \[s10\]. a new study of feedback on nhs cancer services has recently been commissioned, and preliminary findings are being used by nhs england to set priorities for service improvements and to improve the design of future surveys \[s11\]. the nhs’s ability to optimise usage of patient feedback has already benefited millions of patients, and will continue to do so for years to come.

 **1. summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 german occupation during world war ii \(wwii\) had a profound impact on the heritage, memory and identity of channel islanders. while the heritage of occupation has been all\-pervasive, it traditionally focused on the occupiers and ordinary islanders. for reasons broadly connected with collaboration, victims of nazism \(jews, political prisoners and forced labourers\) were marginalised and their stories have not been told. university of cambridge research carried out by carr has led to fundamental changes in the heritage landscape of the islands, evidenced by museum exhibitions, memorials, commemorations and revised war narratives. it has changed public perception of the occupation, encouraging a more pluralistic understanding of the past, and greatly enriched the lives of victims’ descendants. 
","
 **2. underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 the german occupation of the channel islands from 1940 to 1945 has now been shown by carr \[r1,r2,r3\] to be similar in many respects to that of occupations elsewhere in western europe during wwii: jews were deported to concentration camps, as were around 250 political prisoners. sixteen thousand forced and slave labourers were brought to the islands to build the atlantic wall \(the concrete bunker system which covers the islands\), and 2,200 civilians were deported to german internment camps. yet, each of these victim groups has previously been marginalised in public memory. reasons included fear of accusations of collaboration, influence of british war narratives focusing on victory at the expense of victimhood, and the opinion that resisters were ‘criminal troublemakers’ who risked bringing retribution upon everybody. there were also political sensitivities vis\-à\-vis collaboration, with roots in the occupation, which have prevented free speech on the issue. 

 university of cambridge research carried out by carr from 2007 to 2020 focusses on victims of nazism during the period 1940 to 1945 and the trajectory of occupation memory and heritage since. it addresses three key areas: 

 1. uncovering lost histories relating to the holocaust and nazi persecution through extensive family interviews, archival research and field archaeology \[r1,r2,r3\]. research findings include the experience of britons in nazi prisons and concentration camps, especially as gleaned from compensation testimonies written in 1965. at carr’s instigation, these were released to the national archives by the foreign office in 2016. her work in this area also includes study of post\-traumatic stress disorder \(ptsd\) suffered by channel islanders after release from nazi prisons and camps, trans\-generational memory and the transmission of trauma. 

 2. researching ‘guardians of memory’ \(former political prisoners and others who safeguarded knowledge of victims of nazism\) and the role they played in preserving the memory and reputation of victims \[r1,r2,r3,r4\]. carr has studied, distilled, interpreted and publicised the private archives of former political prisoners from each of the islands, the ‘guardians of memory’. this work illuminates the vital surviving thread between the war and the recent past in terms of understanding what happens to memory when subjected to official marginalisation and deliberate exclusion. 

 3. theorising marginalised and taboo heritage, including reflecting on her own activism and its impact \[r3,r5,r6\]. carr identifies ‘taboo heritage’, a legacy \(in this case of war\) that resists heritage creation because of its sensitivity \[r6\], and observes that it can be overcome through long\-term activism, involvement of local government and the passage of time. 

 the research also demonstrates the importance of ‘incremental memory events’ \[r3,r5\]; transforming alexander etkind’s concept of how profound single events change perceptions of the past, carr proposes that multiple small events, initiated by activists in multiple spheres, can cumulatively change historical narratives. moreover, carr \[r3\] shows the value of ‘reparative heritage’, focusing on how ‘small acts of repair’ \( *sensu* marianne hirsch and leo spitzer\) can operate in the heritage sphere to give voice to those whose histories have been denied legitimacy. 

 carr’s research has enabled authorities in the channel islands to open up the sometimes uncomfortable stories of the past and to incorporate the marginalised into the wider cultural heritage landscape.

 **4. details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 german occupation during wwii shapes the identity of channel islanders. occupation heritage is everywhere, yet that relating to victims of nazism was, at the start of carr’s research, nascent in jersey and almost absent in guernsey. proceeding with sensitivity, her research at the university of cambridge instigated fundamental change in how the occupation is understood and displayed. her pathways to impact entailed outreach \(e.g. excavation of a labour camp, memorial, digital and television projects, museum exhibitions, public lectures and locating the graves of deportees for descendants\) and formal advisory roles for heritage organisations \(e.g. the international holocaust remembrance alliance and uk holocaust memorial foundation\). the impact is in three interrelated areas: the cultural, heritage and arts landscape; heritage infrastructure; and personal family histories. 

 **1. the cultural, heritage and arts landscape:** 

 in 2015, carr’s research led to the creation of a memorial to guernsey islanders who died in nazi prisons and camps for acts of resistance \[e1\]. in 2016, she successfully petitioned the foreign office to open closed files relating to all british \(including channel islands\) victims of nazism \[e2\]. concurrently, guernsey parliament passed a holocaust resolution ensuring that holocaust memorial day and holocaust education take place. 

 also in 2016, carr’s research on a jersey woman who hid a jewish refugee led to a successful application for dorothea weber to be honoured as *righteous among the nations* by israel, with a memorial unveiled by the israeli ambassador \(figure 1\). following application by carr, weber was also recognised as a *british hero of the holocaust* by the foreign office \[e3\]. the research led to the novel *hedy’s war* \(harpercollins 2020\) by jenny lecoat \(born in jersey\), purchased by the publisher for a six\-figure sum. lecoat writes of how carr ‘ *… emailed me \[2015\] to draw my attention to this story … \[her\] research … was invaluable, adding depth, detail and authenticity to my own work*’ \[e4\]. 

 in 2017, a blue plaque commemorated the guernsey underground news service \(guns\), whose members were deported to nazi prisons \[e1\]. carr documented those involved, found the graves of members lost in germany, liaised with families and wrote the application. 

 the chief executive of jersey heritage explains \[e1\], ‘ *the work and impact of dr carr in the field of occupation memorialisation has…raise\(d\) the profile of victims of nazism in the channel islands and…create\(d\) a more diverse heritage landscape.*’ as a result, ‘ *public conversation about the occupation story in jersey has developed extremely positively to include new stories researched by dr carr.*’ 

 **2. heritage infrastructure** 

 carr’s research has transformed heritage infrastructure in the channel islands – improving local understanding, tourism and international relations. jersey heritage’s chief executive \[e1\] attributes ‘ *a significant body of heritage and public history infrastructure including museum displays, memorials, publications, walks, plaques, websites and broadcasts*’ directly to carr’s work. ‘ *the occupation period is of great significance in the island’s cultural memory and destination value in terms of tourism.*’ ‘ *jersey heritage contact with visitors, which is infused with … \[carr’s research\], is around 250,000 per year*’ \[e1\]. 

 carr reworked the permanent exhibition on the german occupation at jersey museum to emphasise jews and political prisoners \(2015\) and designed a resistance heritage trail for jersey \(2016\) \[e1\]. in guernsey, her research has ‘ *served to reset the narrative on the war years, in particular shifting the focus back on the islanders rather than the occupiers. her work with the deportees association and the town of biberach in germany to which many were deported has helped recognition of this sometimes forgotten group of islanders, and supported the strong links that have developed…*’ \(guernsey’s head of heritage services, \[e1\]\). in 2018, biberach museum and guernsey museums & galleries \(gmg\) drew on carr’s work for an exhibition in germany attracting 4,000 visitors. in 2019, gmg hosted the exhibition *on british soil: victims of nazi persecution in the channel islands*, based on carr’s research and also shown at the wiener library for the study of the holocaust & genocide in london \(figure 1\) \[e5\]. guernsey’s head of heritage services \[e1\] writes that it ‘ *was one of the hardest\-hitting exhibitions guernsey had mounted for a decade and was seen by around 5,000 visitors including local schools*’. visitor\-book feedback shows the impact of the exhibition; one child commented ‘ *i really didn’t know it \[the war\] was that bad*’ \[e1\].

 **3. personal family histories** 

 carr’s research has touched profoundly the lives of descendants of resisters who disappeared in captivity. funded by the evz foundation \(berlin\) between 2015 and 2019, she created a website documenting every deported islander, with educational materials \(used to support teacher training in collaboration with the holocaust educational trust\) and archival material from the channel islands, uk, france, germany and elsewhere \[e6\]. she also carried out extensive archival research to find the graves of islanders, including joseph gillingham \(2016\), joseph tierney \(2016\), charles machon \(2017\) and pierre salomon \(2018\). gillingham and machon had been members of guns, tierney produced news\-sheets from bbc radio reports and salomon fought against the germans in the french army. all disappeared in captivity. 

 in 2015 and 2016, the bbc travelled with carr to germany and the czech republic to film documentaries reuniting the families of gillingham and tierney with the last resting places of their ancestors \[e7\]. the daughters of tierney and gillingham attest to the personal impact \[e8\]. tierney’s daughter writes: ‘ *my family and i cannot thank dr carr enough, her exceptional diligence … trace\[d\] my dad’s journey, finding his grave and finally after 73 years we have closure.*’ 

 the documentaries changed cultural attitudes and created international and intergenerational dialogue around the treatment and fate of prisoners in germany. joseph gillingham’s daughter travelled repeatedly to halle – the place of her father’s internment and death – to speak to school and university students about his life \[e8\]. 

 the cumulative reach and significance of carr’s research are widely recognised. in 2019, the channel islands appointed her their representative in the international holocaust remembrance alliance \(she has been a uk\-wide delegate since 2016, for the foreign office\) \[e9\]. carr is one of the eight\-person, government\-appointed, advisory team overseeing content of the new approximately gbp50,000,000 uk holocaust memorial and learning centre in london \[e10\]. on 22 july 2020, the european association of archaeologists \(eaa\) took the decision to award carr its heritage prize \[e11\].

 **1. summary of the impact** 

 morrice’s research has shown that the diverse language and educational needs of refugees and migrants require targeted pedagogical approaches in order to optimise effective integration strategies. her work has underpinned changes to key government policies and guidelines, including measures of progress against integration objectives across governmental departments \(e.g. employment, health and housing\), and improvements to specific provision for education and language acquisition. the policy changes enable transition into improved practice supported by a training package developed and delivered by the international organisation for migration \(iom\), and helps prevent marginalisation, reduce isolation, and increase educational and employment opportunities for migrants and the 15,000 refugees granted asylum in the uk annually. in addition, in brighton and hove, morrice’s work has inspired a new language and support service which has benefitted over 420 refugees and migrants, 350 of whom have been provided with individual support to develop tailored pathways in education, training, language learning and employment. 
","
 **2. underpinning research** 

 the ‘refugee crisis’ of 2015 saw the largest number of refugees in europe since world war ii. in the uk, the crisis led to a fourfold increase in the annual number of resettled refugees between 2015 and 2020. the focus of the uk government has shifted to refugee integration and to strategies for improving social cohesion; defining and establishing measures and good practice for effective integration within hosting communities has become a social, economic and political priority. morrice drew on her research to identify indicators for measuring integration, and key facilitators of effective integration via two main strands: **education** and **language acquisition**. 

 **education** 

 in 2004\-06, morrice and colleagues used questionnaire, interview and focus group data from 51 refugees and 59 stakeholders to identify areas of major inequality and disadvantage throughout the education, training and employment experiences of refugee and migrant communities in the uk \(r1\). between 2006 and 2010, she conducted a longitudinal study evaluating the life histories of refugees with highly qualified professional backgrounds and the importance of education, particularly higher education \(he\), in enabling them to re\-establish careers and gain employment in the uk commensurate with their qualifications and aspirations. her research highlighted the lack of policy support for adults and the need for specialist and tailored support to find employment \(r2\) **.** she identified barriers to access and participation, including the lack of recognition of overseas qualifications, the need for universities to be more flexible in assessing entry requirements for courses, and the importance of strategies to ensure equal participation once in he \(r3\). 

 in 2013\-18, morrice took the lead on the educational element \(language proficiency and education\) of a multidisciplinary, esrc\-funded research programme \(optimising refugee resettlement in the uk: a comparative analysis\) with other university of sussex colleagues, collyer \(geography\), and brown \(psychology\). it was the largest longitudinal study of refugee resettlement in the uk, and the first to combine qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate the well\-being and integration of refugees resettled under the gateway protection programme \(in or before 2010\), 4 or more years after their arrival. through this programme, the education experiences of 86 young refugees \(aged 13–24 years\) who were resettled to the uk between 2006 and 2010 were explored. the research highlighted how lack of english language proficiency and disrupted pre\-migration education meant that refugees were ‘aged out’ of free full\-time education before they could gain key qualifications needed to progress \(r4\). findings emphasise the need for support to catch up with academic content and earlier entry into school, rather than long periods in separate language provision. 

 **language** 

 using data from the esrc ‘ *optimising refugee*….’ programme \(as above\) collected at 3 different time points in brighton & hove, greater manchester, norwich, and sheffield, morrice showed that language proficiency was key to effective integration with other british people and society. uniquely, her research demonstrated a causal relationship between higher levels of language proficiency and a range of integration outcomes: better cultural understanding; better health; greater belief in own abilities \(self\-efficacy\); increased likelihood for employment and access to education; and higher job and educational satisfaction. importantly, better language skills were shown to lead to more contact with other communities, but contact with other communities alone did not necessarily improve language skills or result in other positive outcomes, including well\-being. against a backdrop of dramatically reduced government funding for english for speakers of other languages \(esol\) provision, the research clearly underscored the vital importance of high quality language provision to integration and refugee well\-being \(r5\). the data showed that esol provision was often insufficient, lacked coordinated strategies at local and national levels, and was not flexible enough to meet the diverse learning needs of resettled refugees. morrice evidenced that in order for some refugees to become integrated and useful members of society, they needed to engage in informal and social learning opportunities, as well as more formal activities \(r6\). the needs of the most vulnerable migrants – women, those with caring responsibilities, those with disabilities/health issues, those with low or no educational background and the elderly – were not being met by existing provision and pedagogical practices; as a result the disadvantage of language was maintained even 5 years after arrival. at the same time, other refugees required fast track and intensive programmes to facilitate their earlier entry into the labour market.

 **4. details of the impact** 

 morrice’s work has been cited in media articles, parliamentary discussion and support for parliamentary process, including providing evidence for key debates \(impact 1 below\). results of the esrc grant were summarised and published in a full\-page article in  [*the guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/16/language-barrier-refugees-english-classes-integration-esol) national newspaper in november 2016 \(average issue readership: 1,027,000\), helping to promote national understanding of the plight of refugees \(particularly women\). it highlighted the impact of disruption to core education due to the turmoil in their home country, and sought to dispel the myth that refugees will learn english language simply through contact with british people. 

 her expertise in the field was recognised by government and in 2017 resulted in an invitation to form part of a working group with the home office to create an evidence\-based approach to effective integration, identifying indicators and measures of successful integration in language and education, and more broadly across multiple domains. at a national level her research has resulted in change to government policy and guidelines \(impacts 2a, 2b and 2c below\), and the development of a new good practice document on refugee integration \(2b below\). at a local level her work has already resulted in new funding to support the development of a local esol strategy, new pathways and tailored support for esol learners \(impact 3 below\). 

 <ins>1.</ins> <ins>contributing to public and political debate</ins> 

 morrice’s influence within parliament has helped inform and change policy discourse in relation to the rights of marginalised groups. her research on language learning has been referred to and quoted in two parliamentary debates on esol. dame caroline spelman mp referred to morrice’s research on 24 october 2017 to highlight the groups most likely to struggle to learn english and called for ‘dedicated and targeted action’ to avoid the risk of isolation \(s1a\) **.** preet kaur gill mp referenced the research in a parliamentary debate on esol chaired by nadine dorries on monday 3 july 2019. she referred to the lack of language support highlighted in morrice’s research as leading to a ‘tragic waste of refugees’ unfulfilled potential’, and called for new esol funding \(s1b\). 

 <ins>2.</ins> <ins>changes to government policy and guidelines</ins> 

 new government documents and substantial changes to governmental policy documents resulted from morrice’s research: 

 *a\) home office indicators of integration framework* 

 morrice was engaged as an academic advisor to the home office review of its  [indicators of integration](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/home-office-indicators-of-integration-framework-2019) \(ioi\) framework between 2017 and 2019, and co\-authored the revised ioi framework \(2019\) \(s2\) **.** the framework is ‘… used by the home office, mhclg, other government departments and local government to shape integration policy, practice and measurement across the uk’ \(s3\). her research is described as ‘pivotal in its review and redesign’ and as having ‘led directly to the inclusion of new material’ in the domains of education, and language and communication \(s3\). 

 morrice’s research on language as a key driver of integration led to language and communication being recognised as a distinct domain \(it was previously combined with culture\) in the 14 domains of the expanded ioi framework that enables policy makers to identify the different facets of integration. this has necessitated a suite of new and more comprehensive indicators, highlighting the importance of esol provision at a national level. morrice’s research is described as leading the home office ‘to recognise language and communication as a distinct domain with a suite of new indicators. the new indicators we have adopted will ensure that the diverse language needs of the population, including the most vulnerable, are recognised and measured’ \(s3\). 

 her contributions to the education domain resulted in substantial changes. this included indicators and measurements for the education of adults and young people \(a group absent in the previous framework\). as a result of morrice’s research ‘we \[home office\] have included indicators for young people and adults achieving access to tertiary and higher education in the new framework which will ensure the participation of this group is now measured and strategies put in place to facilitate progression’ \(s3\). 

 in addition to individual outcome measures, the framework includes guidelines for local and national good practice based on evidence\-based approaches known to underpin effective integration. these good practice indicators are designed to support local and national policy makers to plan, implement and evaluate strategies for effective integration. the new local and good practice indicators for language and communication stress the importance of strategies which meet the diverse needs of esol learners, including non\-formal learning opportunities; the new good practice indicators for education identify strategies which facilitate and measure progression of \(previously neglected\) youth and adults \(s3\). the indicators are accompanied by an online ‘tool kit’ which provides policy makers and practitioners with a cohesive approach to monitoring integration services and evaluate progress. 

 it is expected that the indicators ‘will be used across government departments \(home office, dwp, mhlg, public health england\) to measure integration and inform policy and practice. the previous indicators were used widely over 15 years and we \[home office\] anticipate that the new material will be adopted as extensively’ \(s3\). referring to the imminent adoption of the new framework, the rt hon caroline nokes, mp minister of state for immigration, described how the framework ‘will be a key resource for integration practitioners at all levels, offering a common language for understanding, planning, monitoring and measuring integration, and supporting better and more tailored integration services’ \(s2\). 

 as a result of the new ioi, the international organisation for migration \(iom\), in partnership with the home office, has developed a training package for local authorities, non\-governmental organisations and other professionals on how to use the new framework to develop, support and evaluate integration strategies. training was piloted with 72 stakeholders from 43 local authority and regional strategic migration partnership areas \(london, manchester, glasgow, cardiff and belfast\) between october and november 2019. evaluations \(s4\) asked participants to assess their understanding in relation to four questions: knowledge of ioi framework, the toolkit, good practice in integration design strategies, and good practice in measurement and evaluation of integration. progress evaluations indicate that 60% of participants assessed their knowledge to have progressed by 4 to 8 steps \(out of a total of 8 steps\). qualitative evaluations evidenced how participants’ thinking has changed as a result of the training. participants will now disseminate and use the revised indicators to improve integration planning and evaluation. when asked if / how they plan to use the ioi framework as a result of the training, participants’ responses included: ‘very useful for some of the interventions we are planning. e.g. esol provision, mental health support and employment’; ‘yes, plan to discuss with my line manager about how we can incorporate into vulnerable persons resettlement planning and delivery, but also wider integration goals of the council’ \(london\); ‘use it as part of designing a regional strategy’ \(manchester\); ‘have started to use this to identify gaps in support’; ‘review terms of reference of our strategic resettlement group, also contract terms of refugee support services’ \(cardiff\); ‘i will be using this when looking at the evaluation of the vprs in northern ireland \(last 5 years\)’; ‘will arrange for it to be disseminated through the department’ \(belfast\) \(s4\). in addition, webinars were delivered to 25 participants from 17 civil society and community\-based organisations. 

 *b\) integrating refugees: what works? what can work? what does not work? a summary of the evidence.* 

 professionals and practitioners at the consultation events requested more guidance on the most effective strategies for supporting integration. as a result, the home office commissioned morrice to co\-author a new  [home office good practice guide](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/812891/intergrating-refugees-2019.pdf) which draws from her research \(r1 – r6\) to summarise the most up to date and robust evidence on refugee integration. 

 *c\) office for students \(ofs\) 2020\-21 access and participation plan guidance* 

 morrice’s research also influenced the office for students \( *ofs\) 2020\-21 access and participation plan guidance* \(s5b\) *,* which includes a new section on effective practice advice for refugee students; their website also includes a direct link to morrice’s research, in its guidance for effective practice relating to refugees \(s5a\). her research has *‘*…helped to inform our \[ofs\] understanding of the barriers to successful participation in higher education for this group’ and ‘… contributed to our current a\-z of effective practice’ \(s5c\). this guidance and its resources are used by uk universities to inform their widening participation plans. 

 <ins>3.</ins> <ins>impact on local practice: language provision and tailored support</ins> 

 the findings of r1 were incorporated into an international migrant needs assessment report conducted by brighton and hove city council \(bhcc\) \(s6\). a successful application to the government controlling migration fund for £188k \(s7\) was supported by a policy brief summarising the esrc grant outcomes, enabling the city to establish an esol hub. the hub provides an integrated ‘one stop’ advice service for migrants with referrals for esol provision and other support services across the city. crucially, the service recognises the diverse needs of refugees and provides longer term support with individual pathway planning. 17 months into the funding \(september 2020\) the hub has benefitted over 420 esol speakers; 350 beneficiaries were provided with information and signposted to relevant services, and a further 70 received bespoke pathway planning and goal setting. this included support to improve english outside of formal esol classes, the development of tailored education and training pathways, employability training, reducing social isolation, and access to other services \(s8\). a letter from the community safety manager and lead on refugees and migration issues at bhcc confirmed that the hub ‘better meets the needs of the almost 2,500 residents who in the 2011 census “could not speak english well or at all”’ and confirmed that morrice’s research played a role in developing a ‘city\-wide esol strategy *’* \(s9\).

###  1. summary of the impact 

 referrals to nhs gender clinics increased by 240% between 2013 and 2019, vastly increasing waiting times, during which the risk of self\-harm and suicide is known to increase. cornwall’s research has shown that improvements to training on variant sex and gender and faith, for faith leaders and gender medicine specialists alike, have the potential to improve trans people’s wellbeing. her work on ameliorative spiritual care for people undergoing transition, and on lgbtqi\+\-inclusive theologies, has achieved the following impacts:

","
###  2. underpinning research 

 cornwall’s work shows how theological categories relate to normative scripts of sex, gender and sexuality in christian tradition, and that these are neither the most ethically productive nor the most generative of ideals available across the tradition. she has identified and constructed inclusive alternatives also rooted in christian tradition. her book based on her thesis, *sex and uncertainty in the body of christ* \(2010\) *,* is recognised as the leading and foundational text in intersex theology and established her scholarly reputation. cornwall’s research from 2013 onwards, underpinning the impacts claimed here, focused on: 

1.  variant sex and gender, religion and faith. this includes journal articles on the centrality of intersex people’s self\-narration \(3.1\) and the theological disruption of hierarchies of good/healthy embodiment \(3.2\), as well as a book chapter \(3.3\) querying the theological assumption that humans may legitimately be sexed only as male or female. 

1.  sexualities, sex education and the churches \(3.4\) **.** the key finding was that trainee clergy given no opportunity to reflect critically on their own sexuality and gender are less likely to be able to minister effectively across their careers to people struggling with these identities. 

1.  inclusive theology of sexuality. this included an extended theological contribution to the popular book *sexuality: the inclusive church resource* \(darton, longman and todd, 2014\). 

1.  theologies of non\-biological generativity. this led to a monograph \(3.5\) whose key finding was that the diversity of christian theological traditions on binary sex, gender and biological reproduction have been occluded in church statements of the last 50 years. 

1.  spiritual care for those undergoing gender transition. in 2016, the sir halley stewart trust awarded cornwall £55,506 for the modelling transgender spiritual care: pilot framework for people undergoing gender transition in nhs england gender clinics project \(2017\-19\). among the key findings were that spiritual care has the capacity to impact positively on trans people’s wellbeing before and during medical intervention; that significantly greater healthcare chaplaincy provision needs to be commissioned; and that improvements to training on variant sex and gender and faith for both faith leaders and gender medicine specialists have the potential to increase trans people’s wellbeing. outputs include a paper calling for improved spiritual care and financial commitment to specialist chaplaincy alongside care by core healthcare teams \(3.6\), and cornwall’s forthcoming monograph on constructive theology and gender variance.

###  4. details of the impact 

 cornwall’s work on theology, sex, gender and sexuality has had a transformative impact on the policies of religious groups and healthcare organisations internationally. her insights and recommendations have been implemented in new professional standards and training among those working directly with intersex and trans people. her work on intersex characteristics and trans theology led to a partnership with an nhs gender clinic in the modelling trans spiritual care project; training professional and campaigning groups on intersex and trans equalities; her membership of a working party for the church of england’s teaching document on human sexuality, *living in love and faith* \(5.6\); membership of nhs england/nhs employers’ project on capturing the lived experience of lgbt people and the impact of faith, chaplaincy services, health and marginalisation \(2018\-19\) \(5.8\); and consultancy for the world professional association of transgender health’s ethics committee and global education initiative \(5.2\). 

 <ins>impacts on public policy and services</ins> 

 cornwall’s work on christian constructive theology, variant sex and gender has stimulated and informed policy debate and led to changed policy direction in religion and healthcare. it has foregrounded inclusive theological accounts of variant sex and gender \(notably intersex characteristics and trans identity\). her research has informed policy direction across contexts and with professionals including clergy and chaplains, healthcare professionals, counselling and gender medicine specialists. 

-  changing church doctrine, policy and practice in uk and internationally: new liturgy and policy recommendations on same\-sex marriage, and blessing for trans people **.** cornwall’s work is cited by the methodist church marriage and relationships task group 2019 in its call for the methodist conference to enable same\-sex couples to marry in methodist churches \(5.7\). it is also cited in a dutch pastoral handbook on transgender, faith and the church. co\-editor prof heleen zorgdrager says: “as a direct fruit of the handbook and the positive press coverage it received, the protestant church in the netherlands \(pkn\) realized that there was a need for new text materials in its books of order.” \(5.7\) in 2019, official authorised texts of blessing and prayer for trans people were published in the pkn’s book of order \( *dienstboek ii,* “services of blessing”, 61b\). 

-  improving social welfare, equality and social inclusion within the church of england; contributing to wider public understanding of human rights conceptions. based on her work in christian theology and sexuality, cornwall was one of five invited academic members of the theology thematic working group for the church of england bishops’ episcopal teaching document on human sexuality, *living in love and faith* \(2017\-20\), with particular focus on intersex and trans concerns \(5.6\). cornwall is the key scholar cited on intersex. rt revd christopher cocksworth, lead bishop for the project, noted the “agenda\-setting” nature of cornwall’s work on intersex \(5.6\). most revd justin welby, archbishop of canterbury, notes that the materials “will help the church to live out its calling … as together we explore matters of identity, sexuality and marriage.” \(5.6\) the church of england will make decisions and undertake synodical processes in light of the materials in 2022. 

-  changing health policy and professional standards of care: devon partnership nhs trust; world professional association for transgender health. cornwall partnered with the west of england nhs specialist gender identity clinic \(gic\) on the modelling transgender spiritual care project \(5.1\). cornwall devised a new framework for spiritual care provision for its patients. the deputy director of nursing, devon partnership nhs trust has recommended to the trust’s chief operating officer that three new chaplaincy posts be created \(5.4, testimonial\). cornwall was consultant \(2020\-\) to the wpath ethics committee and global education initiatives, advising on changes to its ethics guidelines and framework \(5.2\). cornwall’s 2019 paper on trans spiritual care is being cited in the forthcoming wpath \(world professional association for transgender health\) standards of care version 8, due for publication in 2021 \(5.2, emails from soc ethics and education chapters lead author prof gail knudson\). wpath’s standards of care shape the practice of gender medicine professionals worldwide. 

-  informing changes to healthcare policy direction: nhs england. cornwall contributed to nhs employers for nhs england’s project capturing the lived experience of lgbt people and the impact of faith, chaplaincy services, health and marginalisation, 2018\-19, informing policy direction on trans spiritual care with nhs england leaders along with professionals from the police, fire and prisons service. this led to the development of new policy and practice with regard to healthcare services \(5.8\) including recommendations to: review the 2015 nhs chaplaincy guidelines to include reference to lgbt people of faith; develop strategic partnerships with key stakeholders who represent lgbt people of faith in order to address health inequalities; contribute to work of the new nhs lgbt advisory team on health inequalities, health and wellbeing, safeguarding, and intersection between faith and sexual orientation; and develop resources to help organisations promote inclusive environments welcoming lgbt people of faith. jagtar singh obe, chair of coventry and warwickshire partnership nhs trust and convener of the 2019 national project symposium at which cornwall delivered training on trans spiritual care, reported that delegates “have committed to applying their learning in their workplace … and most importantly they tell us that the learning will benefit the people they serve” \(5.8\). 

 <ins>impacts on practitioners</ins> 

-  changing professional practice: new highlighting of spiritual care in gender clinics. cornwall provided ethics training for nurses, psychotherapists, psychologists and speech therapists caring for trans people at the west of england nhs specialist gender identity clinic in 2015 \(5.1\). the same year, she gave training on the spiritual needs of trans people to gender medicine specialists at the scientific meetings of the british association of gender identity specialists \(bagis\), doing so again in 2018. in 2019, she gave a keynote speech to 600 people at the european professional association for transgender health \(epath\), including professionals from multiple countries and subdisciplines such as psychology, psychiatry, urology, surgery, gynaecology, endocrinology and occupational health \(5.2\). an epath attendee subsequently set up an initiative to include spiritual care in the forthcoming revisions to the gender identity protocol in nhs lothian and the national gender identity clinical network for scotland \(5.2\).

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 on 23 may 2018, the austrian ministry of health and social affairs announced plans to restructure the country’s social insurance system based on recommendations developed by lse’s department of health policy affiliate research centre, lse health. 

 in december 2018, the national council \(which holds legislative power\) passed an act to implement the restructure from 1 january 2020, which would see several social insurance carriers amalgamated, thereby ensuring more equitable access to healthcare services. for example, the restructure will ensure that those covered by the social insurance system \(i.e. 99% of the 8.9 million austrian population\) pay the same contribution rate and also receive access to an identical benefits package. the restructure will offer eur1 billion of projected savings for the government. 

 an enactment of the restructure in january 2020 completed the changes to the social insurance system, in accordance with a model of restructure proposed by the lse research team.

###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **research objective, outputs, and methodology** 

 the financing and provision of healthcare services in austria is divided between self\-governed social health insurance \(shi\) carriers and the government. specifically, outpatient care is financed by shi, whereas inpatient care falls under the joint responsibility of federal and state governments. the shi system also covers accidents and pensions insurance. regarding shi, 99% of the population is allocated to one \(or more\) of the 21 insurance carriers based on occupation and location \(i.e. it is not a competitive shi system\). once allocated, individuals and their employer must pay a contribution to their carrier, which represents a proportion of their income, in return for access to a benefits package. for certain services, individuals may also be required to pay out\-of\-pocket. 

 lse health \(the department of health policy’s affiliate research centre\) was chosen to lead a comprehensive review into the austrian system given its extensive earlier research work outlining various policies to enhance healthcare systems across europe, including in austria. in austria, lse health was previously engaged by the main association of social security institutions to review and provide advice regarding the country’s pharmaceutical sector, as well as its public health system **\[1\]**. more broadly across europe, lse health has published several academic articles and books related to health systems and policies, including those commissioned by the european observatory on health systems and policies. many of these papers examine countries with similar health insurance systems to austria, such as germany, france, and the netherlands \(i.e. social health insurance systems\) **\[2\] \[3\] \[4\] \[5\]**. 

 in recognition of this research base, the then austrian ministry of social affairs engaged lse health to undertake an efficiency review of the country’s social insurance and healthcare system \(hereafter referred to as the “efficiency review”\). the objectives of this efficiency review were to learn more about current inefficiencies within the austrian social insurance system. 

 the efficiency review was carried out between december 2016 and august 2017, and culminated in four reports, two of which were led by professor elias mossialos, with support from a team of international healthcare experts from france, the netherlands, germany, and austria: 

-  volume 1: international comparisons and policy options: led by lse health in partnership with the institute of advanced studies, vienna \(ihs\). all research findings and options were developed in collaboration with ihs – no specific work was carried out exclusively by ihs **\[6\]**. 

-  volume 2: legal analysis: led by university of salzburg. 

-  volume 3: stakeholder submissions: compiled by lse health **\[6\]**. 

-  volume 4: situational analysis: led by ernst & young management consulting gmbh. 

 the methodology for volume 1 of the efficiency review firstly involved a review of academic and grey literature to gain an understanding of austria’s political and federal policies, and of the existing strengths and challenges within its shi system. secondly, to ensure policy recommendations were formed on up\-to\-date objective views, lse health hosted two roundtable stakeholder discussions in february and may 2017. relevant stakeholders were identified through purposive sampling, and included: all social insurance carriers and their representative body, key health workforce associations \(i.e. gps, pharmacists, dentists, nurses, and medical doctors\), the patient ombudsman, the pharmaceutical industry, and federal state health councillors. a total of 40 stakeholders were interviewed. stakeholders were informed that discussions were confidential and were encouraged to provide a formal written statement to be made publicly available as part of the review. in total, 32 submissions were received **\[6\]**. 

 **key findings of the research** 

 the efficiency review identified a range of inefficiencies in the shi system: 

-  *challenge 1:* despite equal contribution rates required across the 21 shi carriers, benefit packages were not legally harmonised and therefore citizens did not have parity of coverage. as a consequence, shi carriers covering individuals with relatively poor risk profiles \(e.g. high proportion of older and/or unemployed persons\) offered lesser benefits, both in\-kind and in\-cash. for example, lse health analysis of all benefit packages found that differences in the financial situation of carriers, economic needs of insured populations, and pricing tariffs had led to a three\- to eight\-fold variation in medical aid allowances **\[6\]**. 

-  *challenge 2:* differences in the financial situation of carriers are typically counteracted by a comprehensive risk\-adjustment mechanism. in austria, however, the risk equalisation fund comprises just 1.64% of contribution payments and incorporates only nine of the 21 carriers. consequently, funds are not distributed equitably across carriers. 

-  *challenge 3:* given the shi system allocates people to carriers based on location and on employment status, it was possible to be insured by more than one carrier \(indeed, 33% of contributing individuals had multiple insurers\) **\[6\]**. this created inequity, as those with multiple insurance have a wider range of providers and payment options to choose from. 

-  *challenge 4:* at present there is no single coding system for healthcare services, which makes it difficult to compare prices. consequently, the price of services which fall under the responsibility of shi are not transparent. 

 through this research lse health developed a number of policy recommendations to address these challenges, which are outlined in section 4, below.

 **policy recommendations** 

 in response to the inefficiencies identified through the research, lse health proposed four options to restructure the shi system, each of which identified a unique way of amalgamating and/or improving coordination across the 21 social insurance carriers. each model was developed with reference to extensive stakeholder feedback, and based on an extensive review of international arrangements \(i.e. from european countries with shi systems\), including their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to the austrian context. for each model, an analysis of the “rationale” \(i.e. benefits\) and challenges, including legal implications, was provided. 

 the models were presented by mossialos and relevant ministers to the media and key stakeholders on 23 august 2017. owing to their development for political decision\-makers, the models were proposed without selection of a preferred model, and included: 

-  *model 1, partial amalgamation:* one national accident insurance carrier, one national pension insurance carrier, one employed health insurance carrier \(i.e. regional carriers, corporate insurance, civil servants, and rail worker carriers\), and one self\-employed insurance carrier \(i.e. self\-employed and farmer insurance carrier\). 

-  *model 2, limited amalgamation:* one national pension insurance carrier, one national self\-employed insurance carrier, one health insurance carrier \(excluding civil servants, and rail carriers\), one accident insurance carrier \(excluding civil servants\), and one health and accident insurance carrier for civil servants. 

-  *model 3, health and accident amalgamation:* one national pension insurance carrier, and one health and accident insurance carrier \(split according to the nine states\). 

-  *model 4, insurance coordination:* maintain current structure with a formal mechanism to encourage coordinated activities and enhanced risk\-adjustment. 

 **impact of policy recommendations on the restructure of the social insurance system in austria** 

 in a presentation by the council of ministers on 23 may 2018, the austrian government cited lse health’s efficiency review in its announcement of a restructure of the country’s social insurance system, describing the restructure as a means to “ *provide more healthcare for the patient and create a simpler, citizen\-oriented system*” **\[a\]**. plans to restructure the social insurance system were later formalised in an act passed by the national council, which together with the federal council holds legislative power in the country \(social security organisation act svg\-og\) **\[b\] \[c\]**. specifically, as per model 2 proposed within the lse health efficiency review, the new model would: 

-  amalgamate the nine regional and five corporate health insurance carriers into one national employed health insurance carrier \(the “austrian health insurance fund”\). 

-  amalgamate the social insurer for the self\-employed and social insurer for farmers into one social insurance carrier for the self\-employed \(“svs”\). 

-  amalgamate the social insurer for public employees \(bva\) and the social insurer for railways workers \(vaeb\) into one social insurance carrier \(“bvaeb”\). 

-  maintain the current pension insurance carrier \(however, it will no longer be responsible for public employees and the self\-employed\). 

-  maintain the current accident insurance carrier \(however, if it is unable to reduce expenditure its functions will be merged with the austrian health insurance fund\) **\[b\] \[c\]**. 

 the restructure reduces the number of social insurance carriers from 21 to, at most, five. a restructure of the social insurance system, which has an impact on 99% of the austrian population of 8.9 million, addresses each of the key challenges identified by the underpinning research: 

-  *challenge 1, non\-uniform benefit packages*: by amalgamating carriers, the variation in benefit packages will be reduced significantly. therefore, **equity of access to healthcare services and associated costs will improve**, particularly for those who were previously insured by a carrier with a poor risk profile. it is expected that benefits from carriers will be harmonised by 2021 **\[d\]**. 

-  *challenge 2, limited risk\-adjustment of funds across carriers*: increasing the size of each social insurance carrier \(which will occur due to an amalgamation of carriers\) increases the size of risk pools within the system. therefore, good and bad risk are more likely to outweigh each other under the restructured social insurance system, thus **a more equitable distribution of funds will be achieved**. 

-  *challenge 3, unfair advantages to those with multiple insurance*: under the new system, it will not be possible for insurance carriers to hold multiple forms of insurance and therefore **this unfair advantage is removed**. 

-  *challenge 4, limited price transparency*: by amalgamating carriers, variation in coding practices and prices of healthcare services will be reduced. as a result, **price transparency will be improved, which may incentivise carriers to reduce prices**. 

 in addition, the government has stated that the reforms will save an estimated eur1 billion by 2023. savings were calculated based on estimated reductions in administrative costs, synergy effects \(e.g. joint purchasing and consolidation of it\), as well as by not replacing vacant positions over time \(i.e. over the next 10 years, the total number of people employed in the social insurance system is expected to fall by 30%\) **\[c\]**. 

 changes to the social health insurance system in austria were implemented in january 2020, with the government enacting the model 2 amalgamation on the basis of a political evaluation of the benefits and disbenefits outlined in the lse report **\[e\]**.

###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 over 20 years, case research has made substantial and influential contributions to how poverty and multidimensional inequalities are understood and measured \- and consequently tackled. innovative analytical tools and applications have revealed new dimensions and types of inequalities and built up evidence on groups previously hidden from view. case research has also established the centrality of material resources as a driver of life chances and capability. 

 the research has its foundations in nobel laureate amartya sen’s capability approach, combined with international human rights theory **\[1\]**. it brings together the perspective of focusing on capabilities \(what people are actually able to be and to do in their lives\) with the principles of human rights \(for example, non\-discrimination and being treated with dignity and respect\), which were previously regarded as separate, even competing, paradigms. by developing systematic and comprehensive monitoring frameworks, the research rebuts the challenge that the capability approach is inoperable. it also highlights the phenomenon of “data exclusion” and brings visibility to neglected groups and groups with overlapping disadvantages. further methodological innovations include capturing \(“horizontal”\) inequalities between disadvantaged groups in otherwise similar positions as well as the \(“vertical”\) range of inequality between the top and the bottom of a distribution in the same domain, and associated drivers. 

 the frameworks \- the equality measurement framework \(emf\), children’s measurement framework \(cmf\), and human rights measurement framework \(hrmf\) for the uk **\[2\]**; and the multidimensional inequality framework \(mif\) for international use **\[3\]** \- provide a unified approach to issues that have hitherto had disparate treatment. they are multidimensional, including up to ten critical domains of life such as standard of living, health, education, and physical security. they apply systematic disaggregation by statutory protected characteristics such as gender, age, ethnicity, and disability status. the mif also provides a theoretically\-underpinned approach to the identification of drivers of inequality that operate across time and across domains, both horizontally and vertically, highlighting the cross\-cutting importance of income, wealth, and educational inequalities. 

 on these foundations case has researched particular groups at risk, including older hospital inpatients **\[4\]**. one million older people reported poor or inconsistent standards of support with eating when in hospital in england; this provided evidence of the need to embed equality and human rights standards into the monitoring, inspection, and regulation of healthcare. findings highlighted that disabled women aged 80\+ in hospital were more than 1.5 times as likely as an average older inpatient to have their need for support with nutrition neglected. 

 some vulnerable children are missing from, or not visible in, standard monitoring exercises **\[5\]** and are consequently overlooked in policies to address childhood disadvantage. case research tackled this “data exclusion” by making innovative use of administrative and matched survey data to generate new estimates, including the number of children living in households where there is domestic violence and/or substance abuse. this brought visibility to marginalised groups. 

 finally, case analysis has also highlighted how “money matters” in shaping children’s life chances **\[6\]**. a systematic review examining the relationship between poverty and children’s educational, behavioural, and health outcomes identified strong evidence of a causal link between low income and poor outcomes. this supports the retention of low income as a key marker of poverty and disadvantage, which became a major policy issue in 2016.

 case research provided the framework for improved government social welfare, equality, and social inclusion monitoring in the uk, republic of ireland, within the eu, and the german international development agency. it has engaged with national and international ngos and civil society groups to contribute to campaigns for social and legal changes. the work has also influenced the operational practice guidelines of public service providers, including local authorities and the nhs.

 case research on measurement frameworks **\[1\] \[2\] \[3\]** has become embedded in governmental and institutional approaches to the definition and statutory reporting of inequalities, including to the un, to the benefit of marginalised groups through enhanced recognition and policy attention. 

 a. in 2015, the british **equalities and human rights commission** \(ehrc\) reported to parliament stating it was “ *simultaneously, on equality and human rights, making pragmatic use of the four measurement frameworks”.* three of those four frameworks were developed by case: the equalities measurement \(emf\), human rights \(hrmf\), and children’s measurement \(cmf\). the contribution of case to the frameworks and their use was acknowledged in the technical and methodological annexes to this 2015 ehrc report. the 2017 ehrc report on the new single measurement framework reiterates case’s contribution and notes that “ *case at the london school of economics and political science assessed the purpose and impact of equality and human rights monitoring and developed the theoretical framework*”. the 2018 report noted: “ *we also use the framework, and specifically the domains and sections \[…\] to inform and **structure our strategy work**, as well as to **monitor the uk’s compliance with the seven united nations human rights treaties** it has signed and ratified*”. these citations attest not only to the extensive case theoretical contribution to social policy through the frameworks, but also to the data analysis that case conducted to actually populate them **\[a\]**. 

 separately, the child poverty action group used and cited case evidence **\[6\]** in its submissions to the un special rapporteur \(extreme poverty\) and to the un convention of the rights of the child examination. 

 b. case research influenced the **cabinet office race disparity audit** \(2017\): *“\[i\]n developing the statistical principles, approach to data interpretation and commentary…for the cabinet office race disparity audit's \(rda\) ethnicity facts and figures website, we engaged in regular discussions with case…the data domains on our website homepage are adapted from the ehrc equality measurement framework that tania burchardt and polly vizard helped to develop, and on the work of the national equality panel chaired by john hills”* \(deputy director, strategy and insight, race disparity audit\) **\[b\]**. case continues to have close links with the rda and on 25 september 2019 provided a learning event for them on measuring multidimensional disadvantage of roma, gypsy, and traveller children. rda evidence is being used as the basis to require government departments and agencies to “explain or change” differences in outcomes for ethnic groups **\[b\]**. 

 c. impact on addressing children’s multidimensional disadvantage **\[5\]** has been seen through case’s influence on the **children's commissioner’s office**, filling evidence gaps on vulnerable children. case estimates of numbers of children exposed to domestic violence and abuse fed into the **children’s commissioner for england** headline estimates of vulnerable children **\[c\]** and the children’s commissioner report has now become an annual publication monitoring trends. 

 d. case frameworks have also been influential internationally, for example in the **irish human rights and equality commission** \(ihrec\): “ *the development of the sermf \[socio\-economic rights monitoring framework\] has drawn significantly on burchardt and vizard \(et al.\) work on equality and human rights monitoring both in the conceptual development of the overall monitoring framework, and the preparation of two initial reports on decent work, and on housing. \[…\] dr burchardt has been a consistent, valued expert advisor for the development of this work in ireland and in our contributions to the european network of national human rights institutions \(ennhri\) and the european network of national equality bodies \(equinet*\)” \(ihrec director of policy and research\) **\[d\]**. 

 **\(2\) improved the accountability of central government** 

 case has worked with mps and national civil society pressure groups to influence legal and policy change on poverty, to the benefit of socially excluded groups. 

 a. case research was highly influential during the course of the **welfare reform and work bill** \(spring 2016\), which proposed abandoning internationally accepted measures of poverty. this would have undermined accountability on child poverty. stewart used an foi request to reveal the strength of opposition to the change from the government’s own consultation and, drawing on evidence from **\[6\]**, published blogs, briefed members of the house of lords, held meetings with cross\-party parliamentary representatives, and organised a letter from 175 academics, published in *the times*, making the case for the centrality of income to the concept and measurement of poverty. case work was cited in debates in both houses of parliament: *“\[case at the lse\] reviewed 34 studies of whether family incomes affected children’s outcomes throughout the oecd, and found that family income mattered. what is the point of having some of the world’s finest researchers if we do not listen to them?....\[m\]oney matters, alongside a good education and a healthy life, to outcomes. so if we do not act on money, we embed disadvantage in our country*” \(alison mcgovern mp\) **\[e\]**. this ultimately contributed to securing an amendment to the welfare reform and work act 2016, committing the government to continue to publish the income\-based child poverty measures. 

 b. **\[6\]** was also cited and used by influential national pressure groups child poverty action group \(cpag\) and shelter to strengthen their **legal challenges to the uk government’s revised benefit cap**. cooper and stewart’s research: “ *formed a key piece of evidence in the case against the benefit cap \- enabling us to argue that income, not working parents, is what matters for children”* **\[f\]**. the high court initially found in favour of the claim; this was overturned by the supreme court, and cpag are now considering taking the case to the european court of human rights. throughout this litigation case evidence has been cited and was extensively quoted in an expert witness statement submitted to the courts **\[f\]**. 

 **\(3\) influenced the operational practice guidelines of public service providers** 

 case has worked with service providers to improve outcomes for marginalised groups. 

 a. case research on dignity and nutrition among older patients in hospitals **\[4\]** has been influential in developing the agenda on nutrition and hydration within **nhs england** and was cited in a debate on older people’s human rights in care in the house of lords: “ *a report by the london school of economics found that one million older people reported poor or inconsistent standards of dignity and respect when in hospital, and even not getting enough help to eat. \[…\] so there is a huge amount that needs to be done”* \(baroness greengross\) **\[g\]**. it also featured on bbc one breakfast tv, bbc news, bbc national radio, and over 30 local radio stations, and in over 100 national broadsheet, tabloid, local, and online news outlets. it is one of five key reports cited by nhs england in “guidance: commissioning excellent nutrition and hydration 2015\-2018” **\[g\]**. case organised a practitioner\-orientated roundtable in june 2015 with high\-level involvement of nhs england. in 2016, two practitioner\-orientated interactive workshops were held for professionals working on healthcare wards, again with high\-level involvement of nhs england \(head of patient experience acute services\) and age uk \(head of health influencing\). 

 b. this work has also informed and impacted the campaigning and advocacy work of **age uk and the malnutrition task force**. case researchers met frequently with the health influencing team and age uk to discuss findings and the policy and practitioner implications, and co\-produced a practitioner\-oriented video. the research was directly used by age uk in these and other campaigning and advocacy activities, raising awareness of the problems of dignity and nutrition for older inpatients among key stakeholders as well as the wider public **\[g\]**. 

 c. **\[6\]** underpinned and was cited in cpag’s toolkit to help london schools tackle poverty, in a booklet distributed to all schools by edinburgh city council in 2018, and most recently in the  [cost of the school day toolkit \(scotland\)](https://cpag.org.uk/scotland/cosd/toolkit). cpag report that the toolkit “ *has driven huge amounts of school level action in scotland, helping school communities to understand and take action on poverty*” **\[h\]**. 

 **\(4\) contributed significantly to the policy, campaigning, and advocacy work of international ngos and development organisations** 

 case research has shaped ngos’ approaches to measuring and addressing multidimensional inequality, including to improve social inclusion for marginal groups in developing countries. 

 a. as **oxfam** broadened their agenda to include inequality, they identified that their country teams were experiencing challenges in measuring and analysing inequalities in a coherent, comprehensive, and systematic way. case’s development and implementation of the multidimensional inequality framework \(mif\) **\[3\]**, in collaboration with oxfam, sought to address this gap. oxfam have already piloted the mif in spain and guatemala and are applying it in burkina faso and in vietnam. case developed a dedicated website which promotes the mif as a means of identifying, measuring, analysing, and tackling inequalities, with advice on how it can be tailored to different country contexts **\[i\]**. 

 b. case was commissioned to develop an inequality policy toolkit based on the mif for the **german development agency**, giz \(which operates in 120 countries\). the toolkit was presented to the german federal ministry for economic cooperation and development \(bmz\) and giz are now digitising it. it has already been applied for giz to namibia and south africa. the mif was endorsed by unicef’s social policy officer in nigeria as a method of tackling the problem of inequality in nigeria, one that “ *would allow nigeria to mobilise data, develop policy recommendations and map out advocacy priorities that could become defining moments in the reduction of poverty and socio\-economic inequalities”* **\[j\]**. the mif has also been taken up by international ngos: agence française de développement have been working with oxfam with funding from the eu to apply the mif in west africa, and in vietnam. its application within the eu is also being explored; case joined a european commission expert group in the joint research centre for a pilot project on monitoring inequalities in the eu, which recommended an approach reflecting many of the key tenets of the mif **\[j\]**.

 **1. summary of the impact** 

 increasing physical activity is vital in preventing and managing type 2 diabetes \(t2dm\). since 2008, lifestyle researchers at the leicester diabetes research centre \(drc\) have developed, evaluated and implemented a range of highly successful intervention programmes. 

 the flagship *let’s prevent* programme is delivered nationally through *healthier you: the nhs diabetes prevention programme,* by the single largest nhs\-industry provider with over 140,000 referrals from primary care settings to date. completing patients achieve benefits including significant weight loss, improved glycaemic control and reduced diabetes risk. 

 drc physical activity intervention programmes are commissioned globally and their research has changed clinical practice, national guidance and improved patient health across the world. 
","
 **2. underpinning research** 

 in 2008, the nhs rolled out the health checks programme providing, for the first time in england, a framework for universal health checks for adults aged 40\-75. a key target and cost\-effectiveness driver of the programme was diabetes prevention. an algorithm within the health checks programme recommended that all adults meeting bmi and blood pressure criteria should have their blood glucose levels checked, with high\-risk individuals offered a lifestyle programme. however, at time of launch, there was no robust evidence demonstrating that diabetes prevention could be delivered at scale within primary care effectively and economically. 

 to address this crucial research gap, drc researchers led by yates, developed two comprehensive prevention programmes: *walking away from diabetes* and *let’s prevent diabetes* 

 <ins>walking away from diabetes</ins> 

 *walking away* specifically focusses on the promotion and increase of physical activity and was the result of a programme of research that demonstrated \(via randomised controlled trial\) that combining group\-based education with personalised pedometer use was effective in increasing physical activity, and improved glucose regulation in those with a high risk of t2dm over 12 months. **\[r1\]**  *walking away* built on this model, using a written curriculum, full education training and quality assurance programme and was successfully piloted through nihr clahrc \(collaboration for leadership in applied health research and care\) east midlands. the programme was evaluated in a large rct **\[g1\]** involving 10 gp practices and 808 participants. increases in objective and self\-reported physical activity were observed after 12 months. **\[r2\]** the programme was also piloted by drc between 2011 and 2014 in 4 sites; brighton and hove, leicester, cumbria and county cork, ireland. early audit data from cumbria showed the programme was delivered to over 3000 people at a very low cost of £30 per patient per course. 

 *walking away* was further evaluated through a £2million nihr hta grant **\[g2\]** to investigate whether combining the core *walking away* programme with ongoing text message and telephone coaching could be used to help maintain long\-term physical activity behaviour change over a 4 year period. 

 <ins>let’s prevent diabetes</ins> 

 *let’s prevent* was created to expand *walking away* into a broader lifestyle intervention that increased physical activity along with healthy diet and weight loss. funded by a £2.1million nihr programme grant **\[g3\]**, *let’s prevent* was developed using a systematic approach informed by, and adhering to, the medical research council’s framework for complex interventions, including multiple iterative development pilot phases. **\[r3\]** 

 *let’s prevent* consisted of a core six\-hour group\-based behavioural educational intervention for individuals with non\-diabetic hyperglycaemia \(a high\-risk state for developing t2dm\) led by trained educators. increasing physical activity was retained as a core aim, supported by the provision of pedometers and personalised step\-per\-day goals. the programme followed a written, theory driven curriculum, with follow\-on maintenance support sessions offered annually. 

 44 gp practices and 880 participants took part in the large cluster rct to evaluate *let’s prevent*. results demonstrated that the programme effectively increased physical activity, improved hba1c, cholesterol levels and psychosocial wellbeing after 3 years. **\[r4\]** importantly, *let’s prevent* proved to be both highly effective at reducing diabetes risk in intervention session attendees \(88% reduced risk in those attending all sessions\) and cost\-effective; incremental cost\-effectiveness ratio of £3643/qaly and 86% probability of being cost\-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000/qaly. **\[r5,r6\]**

 **4. details of the impact** 

 <ins>changing clinical policy, guidelines and practice</ins> 

 in 2015, public health england commissioned drc researchers to conduct a systematic review of the evidence for diabetes prevention. their report identified the key intervention requirements for maximum effectiveness, and highlighted the importance of physical activity. **\[e1\]**  this review began a step\-change in the uk regarding diabetes prevention programmes and was followed in 2016 by the nhs diabetes prevention programme *healthier you*, the first ever nationally commissioned nhs\-delivered diabetes prevention service. **\[e2\]** 

 in establishing *healthier you*, the nhs drew heavily on drc research and individual expertise, using the phe report, **\[e1\]** invited drc expert guidance and the nice guideline ‘type 2 diabetes: prevention in people at high risk’ guideline \(underpinned and guided by drc research and staff\) **\[e3\]** to set the key criteria for the programme’s service specifications. **\[e4\]** this service specification included physical activity as one of the core components that had to be included by providers commissioned to deliver the programme. 

 internationally, drc research demonstrating both the importance of increased physical activity and how it can be accomplished, has underpinned significant changes to clinical practice guidelines including the 2018 diabetes canada ‘physical activity and diabetes’ guideline recommendations covering step count levels and recording, the 2019 american diabetes association’s ‘standards of care in diabetes’ guidance on recommended types of physical activity and the 2020 joint research society for the study of diabetes in india and endocrine society of india practice recommendations for t2dm management relating to the benefits of physical activity. **\[e5\]** 

 <ins>local</ins> <ins>impact</ins> 

 *walking away* was successfully piloted by drc in 4 sites; brighton and hove, leicester, cumbria and county cork between 2011 and 2014. this success led to the programme being actively commissioned by participating centres into 2014 as part of their routine clinical care with additional sites in gibraltar, london, northamptonshire and leicestershire added. audit data from leicestershire demonstrated increased levels of physical activity amongst participants of 1000 steps/day. by february 2018, a total of 4573 high\-risk patients were referred to *walking away* in southwark, london. **\[e6\]** 

 in 2015, the northern ireland department for public health initiated the *each step counts* programme to promote increased physical activity for diabetes prevention. unveiled in the 2014 dph annual report, it is stated that the programme ‘has been developed to complement the existing community\-based group intervention based on the *walking away from diabetes* programme.’ **\[e7\]** 

 <ins>national impact and</ins> <ins>nhs</ins> <ins> *healthier you*</ins> 

 following their vital role in establishing the *healthier you* programme, drc researchers collaborated with ingeus uk \(a leading service design and delivery company\) to tailor the *let’s prevent* programme to meet the *healthier you* service specification. this included the inclusion of core sessions dedicated to promoting and increasing physical activity via the provision of pedometers and personalised step\-per\-day goals founded on key drc research findings. the application was successful and *let’s prevent* became the only joint nhs\-industry provider among the original four approved suppliers. 

 in 2016, *let’s prevent* was implemented and delivered in the first wave of implementation \(27 areas serving a total of 26million people with 20,000 places available\), and rolled out nationally the following year. as of june 2020, the programme is being delivered in northumberland, tyne and wear, north durham, durham, darlington, teesside, hambleton, richmondshire, whitby, lancashire, south cumbria, cheshire, merseyside; northamptonshire, leicestershire, staffordshire, shropshire, the black country, hampshire and the isle of wight. **\[e8\]** the implementation of *let’s prevent* in the east midlands region is projected to have the highest number of referrals into *healthier you* nationally, demonstrating the strength of the ingeus partnership. this rapid national expansion established *let’s prevent* as the most widely delivered programme within the *healthier you* framework during the second wave of implementation, resulting in it being the winning entry in the prevention and early diagnosis category for the quality in care \(qic\) awards 2018. **\[e9\]** 

 ingeus audit data shows that between 2016 and 2020, over 140,000 patients have been referred to *let’s prevent*. in the first year alone, 21,233 patients were referred, 40% of whom attended. 

 attendees consistently achieved significant health benefits including the loss of a clinically meaningful amount of body weight \(averaging 4kgs each\), substantial reduction in diabetes risk and improved glycaemic control. **\[e10\]** of those with non\-diabetic hyperglycaemia, 77% achieved normal glycaemic control by the end of the *let’s prevent* programme. published case studies further demonstrate the impact of our prevention programme, with people reporting making fundamental changes to their lives after attending the programme \[ **e11**\]. 

 this data mirrors that of nhs england who reported that the first 17,000 patients attending *healthier you* lost an average of 3.4kg body weight. **\[e12\]** nhs england predict that 390,000 will attend *healthier you* by 2021, resulting in 4,500 t2dm cases being delayed or prevented. **\[e13\]** long term, *healthier you* will thereby lead to an estimated undiscounted economic net benefit to the nhs of £1.2billion due to diabetes prevention and reduced healthcare resource demand. **\[e13\]** *let’s prevent* is playing a pivotal role in these substantial improvements. our work has also directly benefited the local health care economy, where our partnership with ingeus uk has generated over £1.7 million in health service income into the university hospitals of leicester nhs trust. 

 <ins>national and international impact beyond</ins> <ins> *healthier you*</ins> 

 the success of *let’s prevent* has provided impact beyond *healthier you*. in 2019, the programme was commissioned into routine primary care across scotland with early adopting trusts in lanarkshire, dumfries and galloway and ayrshire and arran reporting over 400 referrals within the first 9 months, with other sites joining in 2020 \(nhs lothian borders, fife and east, nhs highlands\). in 2018 the programme was commissioned and delivered across western australia **\[e14\]** with audit data from the bunbury site showing that 193 patients have completed the programme in the first year achieving an average increase of 3.2 points in the patient activation measure. 

 this demonstrates the increased confidence and worldwide commitment to engage with diabetes prevention underpinned by drc research and using the *let’s prevent* model.

###  1. summary of the impact 

 professor fiona woollard’s research on the ethics of infant feeding has reached mothers, health professionals, infant feeding support volunteers and the general public through interactive online resources, professional development/training resources, workshops, and media engagement. it has significantly helped in combating negative feelings about infant feeding decisions that can have serious effects on the wellbeing of vulnerable new mothers and their infants. the research has: 

 1. provided mothers with a framework to help them feel better about their feeding experiences and be more sensitive and less judgmental towards others. 

 2. enabled health professionals and infant feeding support volunteers to feel more confident in discussing infant feeding decisions and to be more sensitive to the need for non\-judgmental support. these influential individuals will interact with thousands of women during their careers. 

 3. helped *alberta health services* \(the largest provincial health authority in canada\) to develop an inclusive breastfeeding policy. 
","
###  2. underpinning research 

 woollard’s research on ethical issues surrounding infant feeding began in 2015. this research draws on a wider body of research into the philosophy of pregnancy, birth and early motherhood, and woollard’s extensive work on deontological distinctions and self\-ownership. 

 existing sociological research shows that formula feeding is strongly associated with guilt and shame. at the same time, women who want to breastfeed face shame, particularly surrounding breastfeeding in public. this can have extremely negative effects on the autonomy and well\-being of sometimes vulnerable mothers and their infants. woollard’s research shows that this guilt and shame is unwarranted \[ **3.1, 3.2, 3.5**\]. her research reveals misunderstandings that implicitly influence the way we think about, talk about, and treat, mothers. she explains \(i\) how these misunderstandings contribute to unwarranted guilt and shame, \(ii\) why these feelings persist despite policy changes intended to support all parents in their infant feeding decisions and despite the good intentions of many health workers, and \(iii\) how judgment surrounding the use of infant formula hinders breastfeeding support \[ **3.6**\]. 

 <ins>central research findings</ins> 

 a\) woollard’s distinction between maternal reasons and maternal duties provides a framework to support and encourage breastfeeding and to argue for institutional support for breastfeeding without legitimising guilt and shame for formula feeders \[ **3.1**, **3.2**, **3.4**, **3.5**\]. woollard shows that there might be reasons to breastfeed – things that speak in its favour – without these reasons generating duties of the kind that make emotions like guilt or blame appropriate. 

 b\) woollard’s research shows that the moralised context surrounding infant feeding decisions may lead to barriers to providing non\-judgmental support. her research explains why statements that are simply intended to convey information may be heard as negative judgments. it also explains how awareness of this phenomenon should influence communication with pregnant women and mothers \[ **3.2**, **3.4**, **3.5**, **3.6**\]. 

 c\) many defenders of breastfeeding argue that breastfeeding should be positioned as the default method of infant feeding in order to fight stigma and improve support for breastfeeding. however, this may lead to descriptions of formula feeding as “harming” or “risking harm”. as these concepts are normatively loaded, this can have serious negative effects on mothers who use formula. moreover, the descriptive facts do not warrant positioning breastfeeding as the default because the application of defaults is problematic in the context of infant feeding. for both practical and theoretical reasons, we should avoid positioning either feeding method as the default \[ **3.3**\]. 

 d\) woollard argues that the right to breastfeed can be derived from the right to family life. moreover, given that women have a right to take part in public life, these rights ground a right to breastfeed in public whether or not one is able to do so discreetly. current public discourse about infant feeding does not adequately recognise this right \[ **3.5**\].

###  4. details of the impact 

 **4.1 direct impact on mothers** 

 negative feelings about infant feeding decisions can have serious effects on the wellbeing of vulnerable mothers and their infants. mothers have engaged with the research both \(4.1.1\) online and \(4.1.2\) face\-to\-face – each is explained, in turn, below. in general, feedback shows that engaging with the research in these ways helped mothers feel better about their feeding experiences, through helping them to articulate and understand their own experiences and to feel less alone. feedback also shows that mothers felt it would help them to be more sensitive / less judgmental towards others \[ **5.1**, **5.4**\]. woollard has also received informal feedback indicating a significant personal impact. one mother emailed: “i had a terrible time with breastfeeding last year and it took a huge emotional toll on me, i think largely due to the kinds of assumptions about maternal obligations that are so pervasive in the media, not to mention the nhs… i've had a hard time articulating all of my thoughts and frustrations about this issue, but your article has been a great help.” \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **4.1.1** **field\-tested interactive online resources: feeling good about how we feed our babies** \(www.feelingsaboutfeedingbabies.co.uk\). 

 woollard led a team of researchers from the university of southampton, the university of cardiff and representatives from the national childbirth trust \(nct\) and breastfeeding network \(bfn\) to produce online materials to be used by nct and bfn practitioners, lactation consultants, midwives, health visitors and mothers to explore feelings surrounding infant feeding. the aim of the resource was to tackle common unhelpful ways of talking and thinking about parents’ choices about how they feed their babies. it also proposes an alternative framework for thinking and talking about the issue to encourage supportive conversations. the nct and the bfn are key players on this topic: the nct is the largest charity for parents in the uk, reaching over 100,000 parents in person each year and over 3 million online, whereas the bfn oversee 800 trained infant feeding support volunteers who help families in the uk with infant feeding. 

 the resource combines woollard’s ethics research and heather trickey’s \(cardiff/nct\) social science research, with testimonials from mothers and interactive activities. as project manager, woollard led the development of this resource. with support from trickey and psychologists at the university of southampton, she presented her research to focus groups \(april/may 2017\), produced text for the resource, and incorporated feedback from phyll buchanan \(founder member and director, bfn\), sarah mcmullen \(head of knowledge, nct\), shereen fischer \(ceo bfn\) and others within the infant feeding community. the resulting prototype was tested through an online survey \(december 2018 – january 2019\), and woollard made further changes as a result. 

 the feedback from the prototype study showed that over 80% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the resource was personally useful and 70% agreed or strongly agreed that they will make use of the ideas introduced in their personal life. user comments included “finally someone understands”, “\[it helped me to\] stop feeling guilt and shame”, and “\[i\] feel positive about this kind of resources \[sic\] that help to change the narrative of guilt and shame against mothers and certainly will make a difference to our already stressful journey.” \[ **5.1**\]. these evaluations can be extrapolated to indicate the impact of the final version of the website. 

 the final version of the website was launched in westminster, at the invitation of alison thewliss, mp, at the *all party parliamentary group on infant feeding and inequality* in may 2019. this group is composed of cross\-party mps and a wide range of key stakeholders in infant feeding. the website was also featured on the parenting forum *netmums* \[see **5.4** for link\]. as of 15<sup>th</sup> december 2020, there have been over 17,605 unique visits to the website \[5.13\]. in feedback taken between 30<sup>th</sup> may 2019 and 30<sup>th</sup> may 2020, 77% of responses rated the site 5 out of 5, or ‘very, very helpful’ \[ **5.10**\]. this suggests that the impact on individuals interacting with the website is comparable to those recorded during the study of the prototype. 

 **4.1.2 workshops and activities for mothers and local, national and international media** 

 woollard, with other colleagues at the university of southampton, ran several events aimed either at mothers, or at the public with a focus on mothers: three in\-person workshops had a talk on the research followed by general discussion; over four university outreach festivals, she ran activities involving craft and informal discussions of the research \(twice in person, once online\), delivered an online animation and chat and ran two online panel discussions with q&a. over 500 people were reached at these events. feedback from these events showed that mothers feel that the research helped them to be more sensitive and less judgmental about others’ feeding decisions \[ **5.4**\]. these events also helped woollard to develop an understanding of how mothers found the research useful, and thereby to develop the online resources above. woollard also wrote articles and blogs aimed at a general audience for *the independent*; *psyche*; and the *journal of medical ethics*. she was interviewed about her work for the bbc radio 3 *arts and ideas* series; *3cr 855am* radio in melbourne, on *talksolent* \(television\) and the *imperfect cognition* blog. her work was discussed in the *huffington post* and the *unicef* blog \[ **5.4**\]. 

 **4.2 impact on health professionals and infant feeding support volunteers** 

 the focus group data and interactions with health professionals and infant feeding support volunteers at workshops and conferences showed that many were worried about how to talk to mothers about infant feeding decisions. significant numbers of these practitioners were also reached through both \(4.2.1\) a series of engagement events and \(4.2.2\) formal training resources – each is explained, in turn, below. these groups reported that engaging with the research helped them to be more sensitive to the need for non\-judgmental support \[ **5.2**, **5.4**\]. phyll buchanan \(founder member and director, bfn\) summarised the impact of woollard’s research on practitioners: “you’ve given us a framework and words for looking more objectively at the influences on infant feeding decisions and the tensions within. once parents have words to express their feelings it takes the weight off their internal struggles. it can’t solve the dilemma, what it does do is reduce the guilt and shame. that is invaluable.” \[ **5.6**\]. 

 each of these influential individuals will interact with thousands of women during their career \(e.g. a health visitor’s recommended caseload is 250 children at any time\). this means that changing the actions and attitudes of these groups is likely to have an extremely wide positive impact on mothers by increasing the number of mothers who receive non\-judgmental support. 

 **4.2.1 face\-to\-face and online workshops and activities** 

 the research was presented and discussed at 7 events that woollard \(co\-\)organised bringing together midwives, trainee midwives, gps, health visitors, nct practitioners, bfn practitioners, policy makers, and academics. approximately 200 delegates participated in six workshops in southampton and london, and a seventh workshop hosted online attracted 1,043 unique visitors and 2,188 page views. woollard was also invited to present her research at many events including the bfn annual conference 2016 \(to an audience including over 100 bfn counsellors\), the european neonatal ethics conference 2019 \(to an audience including an estimated 150 neonatal healthcare practitioners\), the western sydney university infant feeding group seminar \(roughly 15 academics who are also practising midwives, nurses, and infant feeding support volunteers\) \[ **5.4**\]. in total, these workshops and activities reached an estimated 684 people in face\-to\-face settings and over 1,000 online. 

 feedback was gathered from a sample of these events. in each case, a high percentage of respondents indicated that they were likely to use the research in their personal or professional lives: *breastfeeding dilemma* 80%; *breastfeeding and ethics* 75%; *taking pregnancy seriously* 77%. participants commented: “this will inform my tutoring and supervision.” \(bfn tutor/supervisor\); “as a student midwife i hope to use this broadening of thought to facilitate my understanding/ empathy when working with individual women that i encounter during my hospital placement”; ""what was shared by fiona will inform my own personal approach and ‘internal attitude’ as i support women.” \[ **5.4**\]. one nct practitioner and tutor, who attended multiple workshops over a period of several years, said: “fiona’s work on moral duties and breastfeeding opened up ways of looking at the subject, and brought a new language to use when working with parents and my own students” \[ **5.8**\]. 

 **4.2.2 contributions to accredited professional development resources and training resources** 

 in february 2020, woollard was contacted by *gold lactation* \- a virtual education provider for nurses, midwives, doulas, lactation consultants and other health care workers who provide care to women, infants and families \- asking her to contribute to an international accredited online professional development module for lactation professionals, and as a result they launched a presentation by woollard in june 2018 \[ **3.6**\]. the presentation focused on how the moralised context surrounding infant feeding can hinder attempts to provide non\-judgmental support and how awareness of this phenomenon should influence communication with pregnant women and mothers.  in feedback from the initial cohort of participants, 98% agreed or strongly agreed that “the information presented at this activity was pertinent to my professional needs”, while 90% agreed that “the content of this activity contributes valuable information that will assist me in improving patient outcomes.” one commented “very helpful, balancing the need to give information with the desire not to make someone feel guilty has been a constant struggle for me and i have been a lactation consultant for 15 years.” \[ **5.2**\]. *gold lactation* also chose woollard’s presentation to be translated into mandarin as part of a package of training materials selected to be made available to lactation consultants in china. as of april 2020, this presentation has been part of the accredited professional development of 928 lactation consultants in english and around 100 in mandarin \[ **5.7**\]. 

 phyll buchanan \(founder member and director, bfn\) used woollard’s research to revise the bfn’s training activity for neonatal unit helpers, “exploring attitudes to infant feeding” to include discussion of the perceived need to justify infant feeding decisions. this training will be given to around 100 volunteers a year, who collectively help many new parents. sarah edwards, the bfn training manager, estimated that they would also use the exercise in training approximately 50 people per year in the community, as the exercise is also part of the bfn’s school lesson plans and the first milk matters training and she intended to include the updated version in those places as well \[ **5.6**\]. 

 the *feeling good about feeding babies* website \(4.1.1, above\) was also welcomed by health professionals and infant feeding support volunteers as a useful training resource. woollard and trickey were asked to write articles on the website for the bfn newsletter, and *infant: the journal for neonatal and paediatric healthcare professionals –* the most read uk publication on this topic. the bfn also ran a webinar for bfn and nct practitioners discussing the website and how it might feed into practice. bfn ceo, shereen fisher, commented: “we think that the feeling good website will be a very useful resource for our peer supporters because it helps deepen their understanding of women’s experiences and makes us more aware of the issues that influence infant feeding decisions” \[ **5.9**\]. as of 15<sup>th</sup> december 2020, there have been over 17,605 unique visits to the website \[5.13\]. 

 woollard’s research formed the basis of two activities in an online *20 hour breastfeeding course* produced by *alberta health services –* the largest health authority in canada – aimed at all health care professionals in alberta who work with breastfeeding families, including public health and acute care nurses, physicians, midwives, and other health care professionals \[ **5.3**, **5.12**\]. alberta health services produced the activities after engaging with woollard’s work \(see details below\) and woollard helped refine the wording and content. the course launched in august 2020 \[ **5.12; 5.14**\]. 

 **4.3 development of infant feeding policy** 

 on the basis of her work, *alberta health services* asked woollard for support in developing their breastfeeding policy. alberta health services are the largest health authority in canada, delivering health services to around 4.3m people, and 50,000 new mothers per year. in august 2018, a health promotion facilitator at alberta health services contacted woollard asking for a copy of her research to help them with their provincial breastfeeding policy. this policy issues guidance to all medical professionals in alberta about breastfeeding, though is used most often by midwives, lactation consultants, and health visitors. woollard’s work was then shared internally at alberta health services, including with the early childhood manager for their healthy children and families programme, and this led to woollard being consulted at length about the policy and how it should be modified in light of the research. alberta health services confirmed via correspondence that woollard’s research significantly influenced their breastfeeding policy in three key ways \[ **5.3**\]: 

 first, it consolidated their choice of language, moving away from discussing the “benefits” of breastfeeding and the “risks” of using formula to more balanced language that discusses the health benefits, considerations, safety issues and health risks associated with each feeding option. second, it influenced their decision to avoid positioning breastfeeding as a default option, even though in the past this has been perceived as appropriate and even beneficial. third, it caused them to explicitly acknowledge, within the policy itself, how difficult it is to support informed feeding decisions in a wider context in which mothers are strongly disposed to feel judged for their choices. 

 alberta health services has also used woollard’s research in a new worksheet to help parents explore their thoughts, feelings and experiences of infant/child feeding, and to record any questions they have about feeding options \[ **5.11**\]. this form will then be used to guide discussion with their health care provider about infant feeding. woollard’s research led to the inclusion of an introduction that explicitly clarifies the role of the health service in this context, and is designed to help reset any expectation of judgment of the sort outlined in woollard’s research \[ **5.3**\]. alberta planned to launch these in early 2020, but the launch has been delayed due to covid\-19.

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 building on its long\-standing research programme, research by the care policy and evaluation centre \(cpec; formerly pssru\) has contributed to key policy decisions by the department of health and social care \(dhsc\) and local authorities in england and helped to shape policy positions of key international organisations such as the world health organization \(who\). cpec research has supported the design and implementation by dhsc of new national minimum eligibility regulations for social care support in england, the design and assessment of alternative funding arrangements, and informed decisions about the roll\-out of new care services. it has also informed national and international responses to the covid\-19 pandemic. 
","
###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **social care eligibility criteria** 

 fernandez led a research programme \(2012\-14\) to support the department of health and social care \(dhsc\) to develop new **social care eligibility criteria** in england. the research showed significant variability in needs assessment by care managers and systematic local differences in the implementation of eligibility regulations which led to significant inequalities in access to social care across england. three additional studies analysed vignette and real case data to evaluate the transparency, effectiveness, and costs of different draft social care eligibility regulations considered by dhsc **\[1\]**. the research suggested that more transparent, wellbeing\-focused social care eligibility criteria could be introduced without significantly increasing public social care expenditure. 

 **social care funding needs** 

 wittenberg leads a longstanding dhsc\-funded research programme generating long\-term projections of social care **demand and expenditure** \[2\]**. the latest modelling showed that, to keep pace with demographic and other pressures, public expenditure on social services for older people would need to rise from gbp8.4 billion in 2018 to gbp16.5 billion in 2038, and public expenditure on social services for younger adults from gbp9.6 billion in 2018 to gbp18.1 billion in 2038 \(at 2018 constant prices\). cpec micro\- and macro\-models are informing uk government funding reform. wittenberg and hancock led research examining the interaction between the **long\-term care and state pension reforms in england**. the latest report presented projections of the costs of a range of reform options and their distributional effects. 

 knapp was expert lead for a citizens’ assembly on social care funding for two house of commons select committees **\[3\]**. the first citizens’ assembly in the uk to be commissioned and run by parliament, it recommended a publicly funded social care system free at the point of use like the nhs. knapp and wittenberg led \(2019\) a national survey of public attitudes to paying for social care and alternative payment arrangements, to inform the forthcoming green paper **\[4\]**. the majority of respondents thought that social care costs should be shared between the state and the service user, and that service users’ contributions should be relatively low \(20%\-50%, varying by user resources\). 

 **supporting unpaid carers** 

 cpec reviewed the economics of caring evidence for dhsc, to inform a refreshment of the government’s **carers action plan**. findings stressed supporting carers through formal care services and ensuring flexible working arrangements to improve employment outcomes. modelling of unpaid care found that keeping pace with future social care demand from older people would require 3.1 million *more* carers by 2035 \(63% up on 2015\) **\[5\]**. 

 fernandez led the evaluation for dhsc \(2016\-19\) of the impact of the **care act 2014** on carers in england, finding that, despite greater and clearer entitlements to assessments for carers, overall carer support continued to fall post\-implementation **\[6\]**. 

 **evaluating social care services** 

 wittenberg led the evaluation of dhsc’s **direct payments in residential care** trailblazers pilot \(2016\-18\), finding that, although some care home residents and their family members did welcome the opportunity to have a direct payment, there was very low uptake. residents and family members generally were happy with their current \(pre\-direct payment\) arrangements and did not want to change them. care home managers were concerned about the financial impact of accepting residents with direct payments. local authority care managers were doubtful about the benefits for their clients. there were significant transaction costs of setting up the trailblazer schemes, which were arguably disproportionate to the numbers who benefitted from them **\[7\]**. 

 as part of the **nice collaborating centre** **on social care**,* bauer and colleagues conducted economic studies to help nice \(national institute for health and care excellence\) develop **social care guidelines** for england. this work finished in march 2018, contributing to ten nice guidelines. 

 **covid\-19** 

 comas\-herrera coordinated a comprehensive synthesis of international evidence on covid\-19 and social care. an international report on covid\-19\-related mortality indicated, for the first time, that care home residents accounted for about half of all covid\-19 deaths. two subsequent, widely quoted technical reports were produced for  [who europe](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/333067/who-euro-2020-804-40539-54460-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isallowed=y) **\[8\]** and  [who hq](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-2019-ncov-policy_brief-long-term_care-2020.1). 

 fernandez led research for the london association of directors of adult social services \(adass\) to support greater london’s assessment of and response to covid\-19 impacts on social care. this led to the design and analysis \- using data science and econometric models \- of *daily* evidence from the london social care community and bed\-based care market, which identified provider\-level covid\-19 risk\-factors and impacts on the care workforce and financial sustainability. cpec also contributed to the development of a pan\-london projections model for assessing the likely capacity of the social care sector to meet the demand for support from patients discharged from london hospitals during the pandemic.

###  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 two million adults require social care in england. they are supported by 6.5 million family members or friends and 1.5 million care professionals. cpec research impacted eligibility, funding, delivery, outcomes, and cost\-effectiveness of adult social care, particularly in england. 

 **informing more equitable, transparent social care eligibility regulations** 

 cpec’s dhsc\-funded research on **eligibility thresholds** **\[1\]** helped motivate the reform and informed the introduction of a new minimum national eligibility threshold for social care. it identified a lack of clarity in the pre\-2015 fair access to care eligibility criteria, which were based on loosely defined categories of need, leading to significant local discretion in interpretation and inequitable access to care. cpec evaluations assessed transparency, likely access to services, and costs of alternative, wellbeing\-focussed draft eligibility criteria for different need groups. the research was quoted in draft dhsc proposals **\[a\]**, care act 2014 regulations **\[b\]**, and its impact assessment **\[c\]**. fernandez joined the dhsc care act assessment and eligibility task and finish group responsible for defining eligibility regulations and guidance in the act. new national minimum eligibility regulations were implemented in the act, enabling english local authorities to more fairly and transparently assess individuals’ eligibility for statutory support. 

 **informing government social care funding policy** 

 work on **long\-term care projections** **\[2\] \[4\]** fed into the office of budgetary responsibility’s july 2018 fiscal sustainability report **\[d\]**, and into an analytical background report which was due to be published with the government’s planned green paper. analyses requested by dhsc on demand for adult social care and funding arrangements are informing policy discussions linked to funding reform and government spending review plans **\[e\]**. cpec models regularly underpin analyses by dhsc, hm treasury, 10 downing street analytical unit, and think tanks such as the health foundation. invited oral and written evidence was submitted by comas\-herrera, fernandez, hancock, knapp, and wittenberg to four parliamentary select committees \(health and social care, communities and local government, economic affairs, and science and technology\). 

 findings from the citizens’ assembly on social care funding **\[3\]** were heavily quoted by the joint report from two house of commons select committees \(2018\), influencing their recommendation that personal care support should be delivered free to everyone who has the need for it **\[f\]**. 

 **supporting unpaid carers** 

 research on the **economics of caring** **\[5\]** is informing dhsc’s refreshment of its carers strategy. findings were presented at a dhsc/government office of science workshop and discussed in detail with dhsc analysts, and further with the department for business, energy & industrial strategy and the cabinet office. cpec researchers were asked by dhsc to conduct further modelling of unpaid care demand and supply, and a study of attitudes to providing unpaid care. earlier work by wittenberg on projected numbers of disabled older adults receiving unpaid care was cited in the government’s carers action plan **\[g**, p. 5 **\]**, which “ *outlined the cross\-government programme of work to support carers in england over the next two years*”. 

 findings from evaluation of the impact of the care act 2014 on carers **\[6\]** are informing the forthcoming social care green paper, expected in 2021 **\[e\]**. 

 **assessing the costs and outcomes of care services** 

 significant problems with the implementation of **direct payments in residential care** identified in cpec’s evaluation of the trailblazer programme **\[7\]** informed the government’s decision to postpone national roll\-out of the policy across england **\[h**, para. 7.5 **\]**. 

 as partners in the **nice collaborating centre** **on social care**, cpec’s cost\-effectiveness analyses fed into nice guidance on home care, older people with multiple needs, transition from hospital to community settings, and transition for children to adult services. these guidelines inform practice by service providers and policy decisions by local authorities across england **\[i\]**. 

 **supporting social care response to covid\-19** 

 comas\-herrera led the setup of  [ltccovid.org](https://ltccovid.org/) to share emerging international evidence on the impact of covid\-19 on social care, with contributions from cpec and international experts. between 20 march 2020 and 1 december 2020, the website had more than 239,900 visits from 179 countries. 

 briefing notes from this work shared with dhsc and local government highlighted early evidence of asymptomatic transmission in care homes and international examples of guidance to address this problem **\[8\]**. dhsc officials noted this work was used “ *to brief ministers and officials on emerging evidence and learning from other countries and \[shape\] dhsc’s policy response to covid\-19”* **\[e\]**. ltccovid.org briefings were cited by the minister of social care **\[j\]**. who europe consulted comas\-herrera to prepare a  [key speech by the regional director, hans kluge](https://www.euro.who.int/en/about-us/regional-director/statements-and-speeches/2020/statement-invest-in-the-overlooked-and-unsung-build-sustainable-people-centred-long-term-care-in-the-wake-of-covid-19) **\[k\]**. 

 comas\-herrera shared evidence\-based insights from ltccovid.org with policymakers and practitioners at local, national, and international levels **\[8\]**. she provided evidence to the health and social care select committee on management of covid\-19 **\[l\]** and met the minister of social care to discuss evidence on care home visits **\[m\]**. she met the director of chile´s national service for the elderly to advise on chilean government measures to reduce covid\-19 outbreaks in care homes. her advice ensured that the chilean government included unregulated care homes in its covid\-19 response\-planning. she was asked to provide advice to develop and review the european centre for disease prevention and control’s rapid risk assessment for long\-term care facilities published in november 2020 **\[n\]** and advised the spanish social services institute on reporting mortality in care homes **\[o\]**. she is a member of the cabinet office’s expert advisory group for the international comparators joint unit and has provided advice regularly, for example on testing policies for care homes. she was also asked to provide evidence to hackney council's formal health scrutiny committee on the handling of covid\-19 in care homes in the borough **\[p\]**. cpec researchers gave a presentation to the sage working group on care on research on unpaid care. 

 **supporting greater london’s response to covid\-19** 

 cpec’s partnership with adass led to the collection of daily data from 1,300\+ care homes and 1,100\+ home care providers across greater london. these data were used to predict covid\-19\-related risks \(e.g. infection, mortality, workforce availability, financial sustainability\) at provider, borough, and sustainability and transformation partnership levels. daily reports on provider\-level risks were shared with social care professionals to inform local operational decisions and assist in the targeting of support to care providers at risk from covid\-19. live reports were produced which guided, for instance, the distribution of ppe, support with staffing of care homes, and the targeting of testing kits **\[q\]**. 

 cpec analysis of the financial impact of the pandemic on providers quantified the changes in revenues and on staffing and ppe costs across london. these analyses helped target the distribution across london care providers of the infection control grants allocated by central government to local authorities \(worth gbp600 million in total\) and helped to reduce the risk of the market collapsing due to the excess care home mortality and consequent fall in occupancy levels. 

 cpec analyses of the demand for social care support following hospital discharge in london helped guide the commissioning of additional social care capacity to help speed up the discharge of hospital patients, a key objective to ensure the efficient use of london hospital capacity. 

 daily briefings were shared with london directors of adult social services and directors of public health, highlighting key trends and analysis findings at london and borough levels, and daily projections were produced for the london strategic coordination group responsible for coordinating london’s management of and recovery from critical emergencies. these guided strategic policy decisions relating to the response of the london care system to the pandemic. 

 key results of the london analyses were shared with dhsc and local authorities across england through adass. the director of adult social care & health, london borough of havering comments: “ *lse work has been absolutely critical to support la directors of adult social services and commissioners in understanding the power of the right kind of modelling to support our response to the pandemic”* **\[q\]**. as a result of the impact achieved during the covid\-19 epidemic, cpec was invited to lead the analytical stream of the adult social care market insight board, a new regional structure overseeing the promotion of evidence\-based policy in the london care sector, and involving london boroughs, london nhs, the care regulator cqc, nice, and provider representatives.

###  1. summary of the impact 

 illingworth’s *lesions in the landscape* examined the complex individual and societal impact of amnesia, a condition in which the capacity to retrieve and form memory is eroded and the past is effectively erased. the project artworks, which included two large\-scale immersive video and sound installations, a film, and a curated exhibition, raised public awareness of key issues relating to amnesia in a highly accessible, thought\-provoking, and engaging way. the project reached wide and diverse audiences and contributed to the long\-term development of a number of organisations in the creative arts. it supported and sustained innovation, and influenced these organisations’ approaches to delivering cutting\-edge programming. it informed significant scientific and clinical learning and, through its innovative interdisciplinary approach, stimulated new insights into the ways that technology can be used to improve the lives of people dealing with amnesia or early\-stage dementia. 
","
###  2. underpinning research 

 *lesions in the landscape \(lesions\)* is a multifaceted research project with outputs including two large\-scale video and sound installations, *lesions in the landscape* \(2015\) **\[r1\]** and *time present* \(2016\) **\[r3\]**; the film *searching* \(2016\) **\[r4\],** and the exhibition *the amnesia museum* \(2015\) **\[r2\]**. the project was a collaboration between artist\-filmmaker shona illingworth \(university of kent\), neuropsychologists martin a. conway \(city university\) and catherine loveday \(university of westminster\); and claire \(expert by experience\). *lesions* *in the landscape* was supported by several awards, including a large arts award from the wellcome trust \(2013\-15\) **\[g1\]**. its creative outputs contributed to illingworth’s nomination for the 2016 jarman award. 

 *lesions* explored the devastating effects of amnesia on claire and its parallels in the permanent evacuation of the inhabitants of the remote scottish archipelago, st kilda, in 1930. illingworth’s hypothesis was that, in both individual and cultural amnesia, accessing or reconstructing the past is a difficult and isolating process, that this past is predominantly constructed by others, and that this has a significant impact on how the future can be imagined, and by whom. illingworth explored this hypothesis collaboratively with claire: using investigative drawing, through images taken with sensecam – a sensory\-operated wearable camera, developed by microsoft – and by undertaking extensive fieldwork. the fieldwork included a period of filming on st kilda, through which illingworth established a collection of data in the form of video, film, sound recording, data sonification, photographs, sculptures, amnesia mappings, and interviews. neuropsychologists loveday and conway also used eeg to record claire’s neurological activity as she viewed sensecam images searching for visual cues to activate her memory. this research collaboration provided insight into the use of new and emerging technologies to aid memory and resulted in the development of new ways to articulate the experience of living with amnesia. it also shaped the art, science, and public engagement outcomes of the project. 

 as part of the research process, illingworth developed a series of interdisciplinary forums.    amnesia lab was held in australia in 2014, and the amnesia forums were held in london, the outer hebrides, and liverpool between 2014 and 2016. these provided a space for artists, scientists, geographers, anthropologists, writers and curators to explore how art practice, sound, and immersive media can advance understanding of memory, amnesia and cultural erasure. these interdisciplinary dialogues, along with the fieldwork and eeg studies, directly informed illingworth’s practice\-research\-based enquiries and the project outputs. 

 *lesions in the landscape* premiered in 2015 at fact, liverpool. it comprises a large\-scale, immersive three\-screen video and sound installation, incorporating voice, engineered and ambient sounds **\[r1\]**. *time present* **,** a two\-screen video and sound installation that explores claire’s experience of memory loss, was exhibited at the wellcome collection, london as part at their 2016 *states of mind* exhibition **\[r3\]**. *searching,* which focused on the project’s scientific insight *,* was commissioned by channel 4 and film london, and was broadcast on channel 4 in 2017 and exhibited at the whitechapel gallery, london **\[r4\]**. illingworth’s *the amnesia museum* \(2015\) toured widely alongside *lesions in the landscape* and drew together her films, photography, sculptures, drawings, and documents, as well as a 32\-speaker sonification of an eeg of claire’s, brain activity **\[r2\]**. the project marked new territory in employing artistic practice alongside pioneering neuropsychological research to significantly enhance understandings of individual and cultural amnesia. through its interdisciplinary approach, *lesions in the landscape* has developed new insights into ways of conceptualising the complex condition of amnesia and memory loss and its wide\-ranging consequences.

","
###  4. details of the impact 

 **enhancing public understanding of memory loss, amnesia and neuropsychological research by engaging extensive and diverse audiences.** 

 an independent evaluation for the wellcome trust confirmed that *lesions in the landscape* \( *lesions*\) ‘raised public awareness of key issues relating to amnesia in a highly accessible, thought provoking but engaging way. the concepts that it communicated were incredibly complex, yet it reached wide audiences, many of whom were significantly, emotionally affected by the work’ **\[a\]**. these audiences were reached through national and international exhibitions, as well as extensive coverage across television, radio, and both popular and specialist press. *lesions, time present, searching,* and the *amnesia museum* **\[r1\-r4\]** were seen by audiences in excess of 240,000 at fact, liverpool \(2015\), unsw galleries, sydney \(2016\), cgp gallery, london \(2016\), taigh chearsabhagh, outer hebrides \(2016\), wellcome collection, london \(2017\), sayle gallery, isle of man \(2017\), whitechapel gallery, london \(2017\), and the film focus festival, orkney \(2018\). *searching* was watched by 86,000 households when it was broadcast on channel 4 in 2017 **\[a\]**. the research and the exhibitions were both widely discussed in the media and in a number of in\-depth interviews: on television and radio \(including bbc news online, bbc radio scotland, abc australia\); in the broadsheet press \(including the *national*, the *australian*, the *scotsman*, the *guardian*\); in art press \(including *hyperallergic*, *cult frame*, *the museums journal*, *art monthly*, *studio international*, *aesthetica*\); and in specialist and popular science press \(including the *lancet*, the *psychologist*, and radio 4's *all in the mind*\) **\[a\]**. through these avenues, illingworth made accessible a neuropsychological understanding of the dynamic relationship between memory and imagination, and the consequences this can have for those living with amnesia and memory loss. 

 audiences engaged with the research in ways that were innovative and actively inclusive: via presentations – at the whitechapel gallery, london; medical museum, copenhagen; and the aurora museum, shanghai – as well as through an extensive programme of events across all the exhibition venues **\[a\]**. *lesions* was produced by, and first exhibited at, fact, a liverpool\-based arts organisation at the forefront of technology, film and new media. roger mckinley, the head of r&i, described how, ‘inspired by the wealth of shona’s work’, they ‘experimented with \[ *lesions*\] as an education programme’ **\[a\]**. this programme focused on engaging under\-represented audiences across liverpool and reached 821 participants. it included training events for secondary\-school geography and psychology teachers, as well as workshops for young people exploring minecraft as a space for social memory and co\-design **\[a**\]. in fact’s digital ambassador’s creative and digital education programme for older adults, *lesions* was used as a *‘*catapult for wider discussions’ within steam \(science, technology, engineering, arts, maths\) workshops **\[a\]**.  according to an evaluation by fact, this ‘broadened \[the participants’\] mindsets, provided a toolkit for stimulating conversations and sparked an interest in topics they may not have approached otherwise’ **\[d\]**. also at fact, 60 individuals with moderate dementia engaged with *lesions* through the ‘visual matrix’ evaluative tool. results showed that, when directly engaging with artwork content, individuals were able to discuss and express their experience of memory loss with others. this response was described in the programme evaluation as ‘a revelation *’* **\[a\]**. at taigh chearsabhagh – a museum, visual arts centre, and vital community hub in north uist in the outer hebrides – the public and education programme that was developed around *lesions* brought together over 140 people with dementia, their carers, and others in the community **\[b\]**. this encouraged discussion around ageing, loss, memory, place, and community that enhanced ‘dialogue and partnership with the older people on the islands’, and ‘certainly raised awareness for us as an organisation, and i think generally, of the profile of memory loss dementia/alzheimers as an issue in the islands’ **\[f\]**. for members of fact’s senior art school, a critical art school for people over 60, *lesions* also opened up discussions about memory loss. members reported that ‘with shona’s \[work\] it was particularly interesting, because of the amnesia content, there were people who were dealing with this – them, their friends etc.  they came at it from a completely different angle and really engaged with it \[…\]. there was a real impact *’* **\[a\]**. 

 **generating new approaches, enhancing skills and influencing programming in arts organisations** 

 producing and hosting *lesions*, a complex and technically demanding exhibition, delivered long\-term benefits for the two regional arts centres with which illingworth collaborated closely, fact liverpool and taigh chearsabhagh. the arts curator at taigh chearsabhagh, andy mackinnon, described how the collaboration with illingworth ‘opened \[them\] up to a museological approach within its subsequent contemporary art programming’; ‘vastly increased knowledge around multi\-channel video installations’; built new skills within the team; and created the capacity and the ambition to deliver further innovative programmes **\[f\]**. this enhanced skills base led taigh chearsabhagh to commission new work by international moving\-image artists, mairead maclean, joshua bonnetta, amund bentsen and benjamin skop, ‘leading to peer recognition of our \[taigh chearsabhagh’s\] work in this field’ **\[f\]**. mackinnon also cites *lesions* as a direct inspiration for the faodail|found outer hebrides archive film project, which digitises and disseminates indigenous home movie footage. this film footage, shown at taigh chearsabhagh, has ensured a more accurate representation of island life and has also been used in care homes to help promote reminiscence sessions with residents with dementia **\[f\]**. mackinnon reports, more generally, that the collaboration with illingworth ‘reassured our main funder, creative scotland, of our determination and capability in programming high quality work which is reflected in their continued and increased support of the organisation’ **\[f\]**. 

 *lesions* was described by fact as ‘probably \[…\] the most successful exhibition put on’ **\[a\]**. this successful collaboration with illingworth significantly influenced the development of fact: it enabled the organisation to ‘become truly interdisciplinary’ by integrating its research and public programmes; it helped \[fact\] transition to a much clearer vision and targets; it influenced the establishment and development of the research and innovation department; and it led to the adoption of new approaches to programming and evaluation **\[a, e\]**. illingworth’s use of creative methods to translate complex subjects and multiple perspectives \(via amnesia forums\) informed the development of factlab, an interactive, creative workshop space for collaboration between learning development work, the creative industries, and hei partners. ‘directly inspired by shona’s amnesia forums’, factlab ran a series of 12 reading groups with artist and technologists that fed into the 2017 new observatory exhibition and related publications \(part of a collaboration with the open data institute\) **\[e\]**. illingworth also worked with fact to deploy a novel evaluation technique, the ‘visual matrix’ \(developed by professor lynn froggett at uclan\). the head of r&i reported that this work ‘has been a strong contributor to how \[fact\] now evaluate and measure the impact of the artworks we commission and the affect it has on our audiences’.  he attributes this to ‘shona’s support for using the new techniques in an art gallery’, which ‘enabled the ‘visual matrix’ to be tested in vivo with a “live” audience.’  **\[e\]**. in the production of the sound component of *lesions*, illingworth also worked closely with kinicho, an innovative spatial audio start\-up, whose work on a new 3d audio tool was developed as part of the final artwork and installation. after *lesions*, fact continued to work directly with kinicho and the collaboration with illingworth was cited directly in a successful £5 milion erdf bid to support a creative industry cluster in the liverpool city region. the cluster ran for two years from 2016 and brought £120,000 of new funds directly into fact **\[e\]**. *lesions* also offered kinicho a proof\-of\-concept case study, which they have used to showcase their systems and their pioneering approach to prospective clients **\[a\]**. 

 **informing scientific and clinical understanding of the lived experience of amnesia and providing insight into the use of sensory operated cameras as a memory aid** 

 jill bennett, director of the australian national institute for experimental arts and of sydney’s big anxiety festival, writes that: ‘ *lesions in the landscape* has been an immensely influential project. it is one of the most far\-reaching arts\-science collaborations to date with multiple outcomes in both arts and science outlets’ **\[g\]**. *lesions* has informed clinical pedagogy and practice; stimulated debate among scientists and clinicians; challenged and developed pre\-existing knowledge; and initiated new international research studies and networks **\[a, g, i\].** martin conway, professor of cognitive neuropsychology and specialist in autobiographical memory, attributes his improved understanding of the lived experience of amnesia to his collaboration with illingworth on *lesions* **\[i\]**. he communicated this enhanced understanding to over 600 researchers and clinicians ‘to massive impact’ when he showed and discussed illingworth’s *searching* at the 2016 international conference on memory **\[i\]**. catherine loveday, also a professor of neuropsychology, said ‘she had learned more about amnesia during her involvement with illingworth’s work than she had in 20 years of clinical and scientific work’ **\[c\]**. she noted that illingworth’s artistic approach to working with claire ‘changed the way i work with claire clinically’ **\[c\]**. she further recognises the impact this has had on her wider practice: ‘there is no question that shona’s work has influenced my interaction with patients. at a very basic level i simply have a better understanding of the lived experience, which makes me a better clinician and a more discerning academic. at a more practical level, i now avoid asking patients to put memories in a traditional timeline, recognising that this is not always helpful. i also work with patients to find tasks that engage them in the present moment, freeing them from the potential unease that is created when they are left to mind\-wander with a system that is not capable of doing so’ **\[h\]**. this improved understanding has directly influenced clinical pedagogy and student thinking. loveday teaches on both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive rehabilitation. through this ‘there are now at least 4 cohorts of students who will go out into the clinical world with a greater understanding of the lived experience of amnesia, both as a result of my direct teaching and from interacting with shona’s work’ **\[h\]**. 

 multiple scientific outcomes have emerged from *lesions in the landscape*. an australian research council\-funded discovery project \( *mnemoscape*\) drew on *lesions* in the formative development of *edge of the present,* an immersive vr environment that was exhibited at the 2019 *big anxiety festival* in sydney. since may 2020, *edge of the present* has formed a key part of a suicide prevention project funded by suicide prevention australia. bennett links this ‘directly back to \[illingworth’s\] *amnesia lab* and the subsequent work around *lesions* in australia’ **\[g\]**. the knowledge accrued through *lesions* has also informed scientific understanding and opened up new avenues for neuroscientific discourse about the lived experience of amnesia and how wearable sensory\-operated cameras \(such as sensecam\) can improve memory in amnesic patients. the week\-long filming of *lesions* on st kilda provided loveday with a unique opportunity to observe claire using sensecam. this directly informed the experimental protocol for the eeg study, conducted by loveday and conway, which recorded and analysed claire’s neurological activity while she viewed the photographs that she had taken using the camera **\[a\]**. specifically, it gave them new insights into the role of the imagination in memory loss, ‘in ways that would have been unlikely with a traditional scientific approach’ **\[a\]**. lesions also provided ‘a large amount of pilot data and insight’ for the study, saving ‘two years of standard developmental pilot tests in the lab’ **\[a\]**. the collaborative research and the eeg study together demonstrated an important difference between the memory loss experienced by claire \(due to amnesia\) and that of a patient experiencing memory loss due to early\-onset alzheimer’s **\[h\]**. by contributing to the clinical understanding of memory\-making and continuity, *lesions* also provided ‘extraordinary insight’ into how technology, and in particular sensecam, can be utilised to aid people with early\-stage dementia **\[a\]**. conway noted that *‘lesions in the landscape* was at the forefront of making people aware’ of sensecam’s therapeutic effects and benefits **\[i\].** bennett describes how these new insights informed the development and evaluation of an immersive 3d browser for senscam, commenting that this development ‘emerged directly from our work with claire, the main collaborator in lesions \[…\] and is evidence of how the field of memory loss/impairment has opened up as a result of this ground\-breaking art\-science collaboration’ **\[g\]**.

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 *misbehaving bodies* was an exhibition at the wellcome collection, sited in the wellcome trust \(the uk’s largest charity\), that brought together ashery’s social practice artwork with that of iconic feminist artist jo spence. the exhibition challenged audiences and wellcome staff to feel and think differently about health and encouraged the acceptance of illness as a part of life. 

 ashery’s collaborative development – together with curators at the wellcome – of the exhibition, its design, and an innovative public programme inspired the wellcome to work in newly collaborative ways with contemporary artists, influencing the collection’s professional practice to embrace artists’ framing of difficult social issues.  it spurred the wellcome to think about health diversity in new ways and made senior staff more aware of the need to take care of their own and their team members’ health. 
","
###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 ashery’s socially engaged art practice involves working with individuals, groups and communities to promote self\-knowledge and encourage minor narratives, resulting in biopolitical fictions. prior to arriving at the ruskin, oreet ashery’s artworks *revisiting genesis* \(2016\) and *no\-nothing collaborative storytelling in the dark* \(2017 onwards\) questioned how generative storytelling within ‘safe spaces’ might create powerful moments of social agency.  her reputation for publicly addressing illness and death was recognised by her receipt of the 2017 jarman award. 

 ashery was invited, shortly after arriving at the ruskin, to exhibit at the wellcome collection **\(r1\),** in dialogue with a key figure in the history of feminist art, jo spence, who died of breast cancer and documented her illness through her art. for the exhibition, which included a commission from the collection of gbp45,000, ashery produced a new film, *dying under your eyes* **\(r2\)**, that documents her personal process of accepting her own father’s illness and death, including an artistic collaboration with his palliative care nurse. like *revisiting genesis,* this newer film explores the sociopolitical, practical and emotional implications of the processes surrounding death and dying in the digital age.  it seeks new ways to represent illness and death, attempting to break down binaries of health and sickness, and actively, through artistic practice, asking how one might make the ‘abject body’ visible in our present era, which places so much emphasis on wellness. 

 ashery also created a specific, intimate installation to house her and spence’s works, including ‘soft architecture’ and immersive seating, allowing a safe space for contemplation of difficult issues. this design – enabled through unique collaborations with wellcome staff and kohn architects – rethinks michel foucault’s influential concept of heterotopia, transformative ‘other’ spaces, which reflect and upset dominant structures. ashery staged a long table in the centre of the exhibition – a flexible performance space – where workshops and social practice discussions were held **\(r3\)**, spurring the engagement of audience members with the exhibition’s subject matter, and inviting a sharing of their own lived experiences with illness and health around topics like ‘self\-care and survivance’. finally, ashery co\-created with freelance curator persilla caton a series of performative public conversations that explored the exhibition’s themes of death and dying in the digital age **\(r4\)**. an artistic monograph made possible through the support of the arts council england among others \(total gbp20,000\) was published by mousse press to disseminate ashery’s research **\(r5\).** 

 *misbehaving bodies*, the resulting exhibition at the wellcome, which aimed to effect change by bringing illness and death into open public discourse, was honoured with a turner bursary in 2020. an exploration of chronic illness, *misbehaving bodies* marked a further step for the wellcome into the contemporary art space. shortly after opening it was reviewed widely including in *the* *guardian*, *art\-agenda,* and *architectural digest*.

 **challenged wellcome visitors to confront the social complexities associated with illness and death** 

 *misbehaving bodies* \( *timeout*: ‘absolutely what the wellcome collection should be spending its money on. when compared to the sterile, bleached world of medicine – and the sugary pink of cancer charities and “women’s health” – this strange, messy, flawed, incomplete, artistic, female take on sickness is more than welcome’\);  *the guardian*: ‘an invigorating – if ultimately heartbreaking – experience’\) **\(e1\)** has prompted a large and diverse cross\-section of the public interested in contemporary culture and science – as well as audiences who experience illness – to confront the social complexity of illness and death and to rethink the social dimension of fundamental aspects of existence that are often regarded as private. former wellcome collection curator \(curator 1\): ‘the wellcome collection is a free venue situated next to university college hospital and, as such, receives many audiences who have visited the oncology wards and waiting on loved\-ones who may be using the wellcome as a respite space’. **\(e2\)** 

 *misbehaving bodies* was visited by an average of 809 people a day: 166,560 in total **\(e3\)**. curator 1: ‘it’s exceeded our expectations with regards to footfall’ **\(e4\);** ‘a significant number for an exhibition dealing with such political work’ **\(e2\);** indeed, the first four months of *misbehaving bodies* were the most successful ever at the wellcome, with over 57,000 visitors in september 2019, up 40% from september 2018 and 55% from september 2017.  the exhibition was extended beyond initial planning to an eight\-month run, the longest ever for a contemporary art exhibition at the wellcome collection. 

 a wellcome curator \(curator 2\) observed: ‘something very impactful happens when people encounter this work… when the private and public merge: it makes audiences confront their own vulnerabilities’. **\(e5\)** visitor experience assistant \(vea\) 1 comments: ‘the visitors i spoke to felt the exhibition stirred something in them, an awareness of death.  for me, the exhibition was an encouragement to live’. **\(e6\)** another, \(vea 2\) noted that audience members shared a sense of solidarity around some quite personal experiences. ‘they seemed to feel that this was an acceptable space to feel vulnerable’. **\(e7\)** curator 1: ‘ *misbehaving bodies* was a gallery as a community space, to congregate and ask questions about how to grieve and value vulnerability publicly’ **\(e2\)**. 

 at the exhibition’s exit, ashery explicitly invited audiences to reflect on the question ’do you consider yourself healthy?’ and to deposit their responses; hundreds were received.  wellcome curator 1: ‘i’m struck by how few of the respondents – of all ages – consider themselves “one hundred per cent” healthy. themes addressed include mental and physical health, exercise, friendship, diet, disability, feelings of self worth, chronic pain and terminal illness’. **\(e2\)**  many responses questioned the binary of ‘healthy/ ill’, and evinced resilience: ‘my health isn’t perfect … seeing an exhibition of people who will soon die makes me realise how healthy i am’.  ‘we are so complex, can all of us be healthy all of the time? thank you for making me think about my body.’  ‘am i healthy? am i not healthy? i am neither. i am alive’. **\(e8\)** 

 participants in ashery’s long table social artwork described feeling free to express themselves: ‘there aren’t many spaces like this’; ‘this has somehow become a safe space for me’ and shared difficult personal experiences of loneliness due to ill health, as well as positive ones around care for self and others: ‘you’re taking care of yourself \[when you\] take care of your community, and i think we do that in sharing personal difficulties, so thank you’. **\(e9\)** another participant observed: ‘…chronic illness can be extremely performative, the way we present ourselves as disabled people… it helped me root myself in the art world... it was extremely refreshing to me \[as\] that’s all i’m looking for’. **\(e10\)** another lauded the discussions’ removal of the taboo of death and has since used *dying under your eyes* as an educational resource for health & social care practitioners at the open university. **\(e11\)** 

 **changed the wellcome collection’s long term approach to exhibition planning and encouraged new ways for staff think about health diversity** 

 *misbehaving bodies* also encouraged the wellcome to work in newly collaborative ways with contemporary artists so that they might play an increasingly important role in open debates about public health. curators and policy\-makers at the collection have been emboldened by new experiments with ashery to involve artists in future exhibition\-making in ways they have not done in the past – enabling lasting and growing impact into the future. curator 1 asserts that it was ‘crucial that the exhibition foregrounded the voice of the artist, creating a space for the public to reflect on how they think and feel about healthcare themselves’. **\(e2\)**  curator 2: ‘this collaboration with oreet gives the wellcome team confidence and pride in working with contemporary artists – something that has not always come naturally in our institution’. **\(e5\)** similarly, the wellcome head of live programme observed that the conversations ‘can be quite taboo… \[together with oreet\], the live programme was always conceived to be about depth of engagement, so that people had truly meaningful opportunities to share… something that we don’t often do in exhibitions programming’. **\(e12\)**the exhibition was a first for the wellcome in two ways:  ashery was the first artist to co\-design the exhibition, and she was the first to co\-design the public programme. positive experiences have encouraged curators at the collection to repeat the model. curator 1:  ‘viewers did not enter a neutral white cube environment but rather a space defined by the artists’ personalities. . .  this was very much *their* space. . . we wanted people to feel immersed in the work and not on the outside looking in . . . a place where people felt like they were being “hugged”’. **\(e2\)** curator 2 : ‘it was unique to include the artist as part of the design team, and it was a leap of imagination for us. if an architectural firm had designed the show, perhaps it wouldn’t have felt like the “safe space” that oreet created’. **\(e5\)** they are now thinking about involving an artist in their next process. the head of live programme agreed that oreet’s artist\-led public programme was ‘…a departure from how we usually work... good practice… has evolved as part of this, that we can learn from and continue to develop in the rest of what we do’. **\(e12\)** 

 working collaboratively and creatively with ashery also allowed curators of the collection to tackle emotionally and socially difficult work which they might not otherwise have embraced.  curator 2: ‘we've learnt a lot as an institution, going forward, about giving space to an artist, about giving them the freedom to experiment around socially sensitive topics’. **\(e5\)** wellcome head of live programme: ‘it felt really important, the agility and flexibility to mould how we programme with \[oreet\] based on where her ideas are taking her, and that’s… an approach we’d like to continue.’ **\(e12\)** curator 2 continues: ‘the curatorial team had concerns about the fact that jo spence publicly refused chemotherapy… which confronts wellcome trust science. oreet’s intergenerational response allowed a framework through which to present a variety of points of view. *’* **\(e5\)** 

 due to ashery’s sustained artistic engagement with questions around illness and health, death and life, and because of her dialogue about self\-care –both private and public– *misbehaving bodies* spurred the wellcome to think about health diversity in new ways. senior staff charged with shaping the direction of the trust’s public programme noted *misbehaving bodies’*s profound impact on their thinking about health. curator 1: ‘\[oreet’s\] work feeds into a pressing conversation about who the institution is for, who it represents… intellectually who we are’. **\(e4\)** curator 2: ‘the concept of diversity in art institutions is normally thought about in terms of gender, race and access, but not health diversity. our internal curatorial conversations about oreet’s show have influenced the direction we are marching towards’. **\(e5\)** the head of live programme asserted, ‘\[ *misbehaving bodies*\] has taken that ambition for us to think about lived experience… \[and to\] move away from an overtly medicalised understanding of health to a social model of health… \[it\] was a huge building block in how we newly position ourselves, in terms of how we talk about healthcare, how we talk about health diversity, how we talk about individuals within healthcare systems and what we understand by “health”’. **\(e12\)** 

 **fostered a new understanding and approach for the wellcome collection, as a public organisation, to support its own staff** 

 because *misbehaving bodies* addressed sensitivities around health, illness and care, emphasising lived experiences, the wellcome implemented innovative methods for caring for staff. curator 2 noted: ‘being in conversation with oreet and her work taught me a lot about the responsibilities we have as a public organisation to look after people’.  curator 1: ‘a budget was allocated for a programme of wellbeing during the project. . . early on during my involvement we invited the cancer charity maggie’s to act as consultants on the project . . . maggie’s undertook a series of workshops with wellcome collection staff and became sounding boards throughout the project... a clinical psychologist from the oncology care team at uclh, was brought in to lead a wellbeing workshop for staff and various stakeholders. \[she\] talked about her experience of working with people recently diagnosed with cancer who were undergoing treatment and proposed a series of self\-care techniques’. **\(e2\)** 

 the exhibitions project manager and freelance consultant commented: ‘\[we\] wanted to prepare our visitor experience team to feel as though they could cope with any difficult conversations that might come up… the need for support has \[since\] been really high on our exhibitions team agenda’. **\(e13\)** the vea team was prepared with conversations about how to cope with the emotional impact of the exhibition on visitors. they received formal training from the samaritans emphasising listening skills. curator 1 attests that ‘there was feedback from colleagues that \[these sessions\] were valuable in creating an environment in the institution and a space outside of the delivery schedule for discussion and to air concerns. this often invisible work – caring for stakeholders and colleagues – needs capacity, time and money. co\-curating this exhibition has highlighted the need for these processes to be embedded at the outset on all projects at all institutions. . . the support opened up a safe space for people to talk on the subject’. **\(e2\).** the vea team was also given opportunities to reflect, in informal ‘tea and biscuits’ group sessions inspired by ashery’s social practice, on their experiences with the work, in order to emotionally digest what they had found difficult. **\(e6\)**

##  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 two collaborative applied conversation analytic studies undertaken at the university of york, have led to a transformative programme of impact activities, reaching across numerous medical specialties in four countries: brazil, the netherlands, norway and the uk. this includes translation of the research findings into brazilian portuguese, dutch and norwegian. the research identified, for the first time, the specific communication skills needed to offer patients choice effectively. by producing innovative face\-to\-face and online training with international reach, the research team, led by dr toerien, has trained over 200 medical students and practitioners in these skills directly. the value of the research for improving medical training and practice has been widely recognised by medical educators and guideline producers, ensuring the breadth and longevity of the research impact well beyond those directly trained. the key impacts are: 

-  a documented, positive change in medical students’ and practitioners’ awareness, understanding and practice regarding how best to offer patients choice; 

-  direct influence on the content of medical training curricula, and on how medical educators train students in shared decision\-making; 

-  inclusion of the findings in two national clinical communication guidelines: for the dutch college of gps and the uk’s national institute for health and care excellence. 
","
##  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 conducted between october 2011 and september 2018, the research used an innovative blend of conversation analysis \(ca\) and statistical techniques to compare different approaches to decision\-making identified in nhs\-based neurology consultations. co\-investigators drs toerien and jackson led on the ca component, which is critical to the impacts described. the chief investigator was consultant neurologist, professor markus reuber \(university of sheffield\). an extensive pre\-project literature review revealed only two studies investigating choice in practice, neither of which considered doctor\-led care. the research thus makes a substantive, empirical contribution by demonstrating which interactional practices work best for enabling patients to <ins>firstly</ins>, recognise that they have a choice and, <ins>secondly</ins>, engage more actively in decision\-making. the research dataset consists of 223 recorded neurology consultations, plus pre\- and post\-consultation questionnaires, giving unprecedented insight into what really happens when clinicians offer choice, and how this is experienced by patients. 

 the ideal of shared decision\-making has been endorsed for over 40 years and is embedded in the nhs constitution, required by the uk’s general medical council, and recommended by the national institute for health and care excellence \(nice\). yet research – including that underpinning this case study **\[a\]\[b\]\[d\]\[e\]** – repeatedly shows that clinicians struggle to enact the ideal in practice. this matters because patients report wanting to be more involved in decision\-making and because there is good evidence for a host of positive outcomes when they are **\[a\]\[b\]**. there is agreement that better communication skills are key to making shared decision\-making a reality, but conventional training has been criticised – by medics themselves – for having *“ignored insights from conversation analysis”* \(gulbrandsen, letter in the bmj, 2020\). seeking to address such short\-comings, the ‘patient choice in practice’ project **\[a\]\[b\]** – funded by two national institute for health research \(health services and delivery\) grants \(10/2000/61 & 14/19/43\) – sought to understand the *specific* communication skills needed to offer patients choice most effectively. 

 the research showed that, despite the long\-standing guidance that patients should be enabled to make an ‘informed choice’, recommending remains overwhelmingly more common than offering choice **\[b\]\[d\]\[e\].** however, the research also identified two effective practices for offering choice: \(1\) *option\-listing,* which involves explicit listing of alternatives from which the patient may choose **\[a\-e\]**; and \(2\) *patient view elicitors \(pves\)*, which include formats that invite patients to express a preference, how they feel about an option, and variants on this theme. pves may be used alone or with option\-lists to give patients opportunities to direct the decision\-making according to their own views **\[a\]\[b\]\[e\]**. by comparing these two practices with the standard practice of *recommending* a single option, this research found that: 

1.  full\-form option\-listing, which includes three components – summarised as alf: <ins>a</ins>nnouncing a decision is to be made, <ins>l</ins>isting the options, <ins>f</ins>inding out what the patient wants using a pve – was the most effective way for clinicians to actively invite patients’ involvement in the decision\-making **\[a\]\[b\]\[c\]**; 

1.  however, option\-listing was remarkably rare **\[b\]\[e\]** – a striking finding given that this is core to shared decision\-making and described specifically as the ‘gold standard’ in some guidelines \(e.g. royal college of surgeons, 2016\). 

1.  clinicians and patients were significantly more likely to agree that a choice had been offered if a pve or option\-list \(as opposed to a recommendation\) was used, indicating their effectiveness for enabling patients to recognise they have a choice **\[b\]\[e\]**. 

1.  whilst recommendations nearly always ended in agreement to undertake the clinician’s preferred course of action, option\-lists and pves did so only about two\-thirds of the time \(a statistically significant difference\) **\[b\]\[e\]**. 

 these findings imply a dilemma: on the one hand, there has been an emphasis in nhs policy on increasing patient choice since at least 2000; on the other hand, clinical guidelines may indicate that a particular treatment option is recommended. toerien *et al.* thus argue that it is too simplistic to suggest \(as the royal college of surgeons does\) that recommendations should be abandoned in favour of option\-listing **\[e\]**. rather, **clinicians need to be aware of the advantages and risks of each approach to decision\-making in order to balance their duty of care with their responsibility to empower patients to make their own decisions**. this is not an easy task, hence the need for nuanced, specific communication training, grounded in how decision\-making actually works. the research demonstrated that the communication skills identified work effectively to offer patients choice on the frontline. moreover, the rich evidence base of recorded consultations provides – for the first time – best practice examples of patient choice, rooted in the complexities of real clinical interaction.

##  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 through a multi\-pronged programme of impact activities, the research has: 

1.  been used to train medical students and practitioners in communication skills. 

1.  directly influenced medical curricula and medical educators. 

1.  been included in two sets of national clinical communication guidelines \(netherlands and uk\). 

 these impact activities are highly significant because, as noted above, involving patients in decision\-making is a widespread ‘best practice’ requirement, but there is extensive evidence that clinicians find it difficult to do. the impact activities have achieved notable reach, having made a positive difference in four countries across two continents \(brazil, the netherlands, norway, the uk\), reaching four types of beneficiary: medical students, medical practitioners, healthcare educators and medical guideline producers. the research findings have been used across multiple specialties, including neurology, general practice, ophthalmology, and emergency medicine. 

 <ins> **impact 1. a documented, positive change in medical students’ and practitioners’</ins> <ins> **awareness, understanding and practice**</ins> <ins>regarding how best to offer patients choice.</ins>** 

 this was achieved by delivering evidence\-based communication skills training, in person, to over 200 medical students and practitioners, including end\-of\-project nihr\-funded workshops for neurologists in the uk \(glasgow and sheffield\), and invited workshops for psychiatrists in glasgow, medical students and practitioners in brazil, and ophthalmic practitioners and trainees in belfast. these have been described as a “ *perspective\-changing learning experience… not just for the future profession but for their next\-day practice already\!*” \(medical educator, brazil\) **\[1a\]**. student participants reported rapidly utilising what they had learnt, despite this often being at odds with what they observed their supervisors doing **\[1b\]\[1c\]\[1d\]**. one drew upon the training to counter a professor’s suggestion that they tell a patient what to do: “ *in that moment all my studies of patient choice made complete sense and i said, ‘why don’t we ask the patient what she would like?’*” the professor agreed, and the patient’s positive response has convinced the student to implement patient choice in her future practice **\[1d\]**. experienced medical practitioners reported “ *more awareness of my own practice*” \(optometrist, belfast\) **\[1e\]** and positive changes following the training: “ *i used to think that my practice included patient’s choice. but now i am beginning to realize that there are many more situations, such as decisions about medical procedures, exams, besides treatment\!... it has already started\! today in my practice i have realized my opportunities to introduce choices in medical decisions\!”* \(neurologist, brazil\) **\[1e\]**. 

 a two\-hour e\-learning package, called ‘patient choice in practice’, was developed to augment the face\-to\-face workshops that were curtailed by the covid\-19 pandemic, as well as to ensure longevity and reach of the training \(see also impact 2, below\). this was piloted in 2020 with 55 medical students in brazil, who also received a three\-hour online workshop \(delivered twice by toerien\), with real\-time translation into brazilian portuguese. positive evaluations by participants were publicly reported on the unisinos news pages: “ *i was able to deepen and solidify my knowledge… how to bring these options… giving space for the patient to bring their thoughts, values ​​and desires in relation to that decision… the knowledge acquired in the workshop makes my practice even more respectful, sensitive to the other*” **\[2\]**. formal evaluation was conducted using pre\- and post\-training questionnaires. **these showed that the training led to a statistically significant increase \(wilcoxon sign rank test\) in participants’ confidence in how to offer patients choice** **\[3\]**, particularly through the skills taught around option\-listing and seeking patient views: “ *the most important thing i learned was how to include the patient in the decision \(through the use of alf and, mainly, pves\). after the workshop, i concluded that, during our practices, we disseminated many more recommendations than shared decision\-making processes, without even realizing it. so, i leave this workshop much more aware of this*” **\[3\]**. **the majority of participants \(80%\) reported that they would now offer choice in situations when they would not have done so before the training \[3\].** 

 <ins> **impact 2: a lasting change in medical curricula and medical educators’ approach to communication skills training**</ins><ins>.</ins> the repeat invitation to toerien \(2019 and 2020\) to provide training on patient choice to the medical students at unisinos \(brazil\) represents a lasting change to the curriculum. this will continue directly through the patient choice in practice e\-learning package, which has been adopted for ongoing use at unisinos **\[1a\]\[4\]**, queen’s university belfast **\[5\]** and manchester medical schools. as a medical educator at manchester medical school notes: *“the patient choice in practice elearning package addresses a crucial part of communication in clinical care. rather than training based on simulated clinical practice, it uses real clinical encounters to encourage participants to think critically about how to balance patients’ right to choose with the practitioner’s duty of care. this will provide clinicians with greater authenticity in the teaching presented to them and greater clinician acceptance of the learning it provides. the package dovetails with other areas of communication training and addresses a curriculum gap”* **\[6\]**. the medical educators also report how the research has influenced their own teaching: “ *the workshop patient choice in practice generated impact on my teaching to second year\-med students… i, along with the lead tutor of language and interaction in healthcare, have referred to \[toerien et al’s\] work in class… and we agreed to permanently incorporate \[their\] work on the syllabus we will be offering*” **\[4\]**. 

 educators in norway have incorporated the research in continuing professional development training: *“findings from \[toerien et al’s\] research have been amongst the key take home messages in lectures i’ve delivered on how to achieve patient choice and shared decision making in practice. this is one of the most challenging communicative tasks in modern health care, and \[toerien et al’s\] empirical findings are powerful in demonstrating how it can be accomplished in practice”* \(educator responsible for training over 200 norwegian specialists in general medicine and ophthalmology, at stavanger university hospital\) **\[7\]**. for those who teach and practice medicine, the research has had a double impact. *“\[toerien et al’s\] papers on patient choice have greatly influenced my thinking and knowledge around \(shared\) decision making, both with regards to my own research, clinical practice and my teaching these subjects at uit the arctic university of norway’s medical school… students have been very engaged with the issues \[toerien et al have\] raised, prompting important learning about and hands\-on training in communicating with ‘difficult’ patients… and patients with chronic disease”* \(head of the emergency department of nordland hospital\) **\[8\]**. the research impact in norway will have longevity because the *“findings about what constitutes patient choice have also been given a prominent place in the first conversation analytic introductory book in norwegian, focusing on conversation as a tool for professional practice”* **\[7\]**. this includes a translation of material from the final report **\[a\]**. 

 <ins> **impact 3: inclusion of the research findings in two national clinical communication guidelines \(in the netherlands and the uk\)**</ins>. as a result of delivering the keynote based on her research – described as an “eye\-opener” **\[9a\]** – at the 2019 dutch gp science day, toerien was invited to provide “expert input” **\[9a\]** into the first clinical communication guidelines, developed by the dutch college of general practitioners \(nederlands huisartsen genootschap; nhg\). toerien delivered findings from the research on patient choice as well as an overview of ca findings on gp consultations in a 45\-page report **\[9b\]** and 6 hours of discussion of the evidence with the nhg programme manager for person\-centred care. she reports: *“i* *am extremely pleased with the way \[toerien\] was able to apply \[her\] scientific knowledge on ca to day\-to\-day gp practice. i learned a lot about patient choice in practice, which is a very important step for shared decision\-making… \[toerien’s report\] provides a sound basis and it will be easy to translate the evidence into the communication modules*” **\[9a\]**. the final production of the guidelines has been delayed due to covid\-19, but **it has been confirmed that toerien’s input will definitely be included** **\[9a\]**. the guidelines will be applied in e\-learning programmes developed by the nhg in order to make current knowledge on communication easily accessible to all dutch gps. *“the goal is to improve the clarity of gps’ communication – making it easier for patients to understand their diagnosis and any treatment options – and to equip gps to know how to solicit patients’ own concerns and preferences as the basis for a patient\-centred approach to healthcare”* **\[9a\]**. in contributing so extensively to the development of these guidelines, then, the research will benefit not only all dutch gps but the patients with whom they communicate on a daily basis. 

 **the e\-learning materials have also been accepted for inclusion in a comprehensive set of training resources to support clinicians across the uk to enact the nice shared decision\-making \(sdm\) guidelines** **\[10\]**. nice will publish these guidelines in june 2021 but recognise that guidelines alone are not sufficient to counter the difficulties clinicians experience in enacting sdm. acknowledging that “much centres on consultation skills” and that the current approach to training is inadequate, the nice team see significant benefits to the novel approach taken in the e\-learning package: *“we were delighted to be made aware of the york research and resources. they have the capacity to re\-energise the rather ‘stuck’ consultation skills teaching and learning silo, and link that with shared decision making, which is under\-done in practice. we were also delighted to see ‘three things to remember’ as opposed to 78 items in the calgary cambridge consultation model. the tone of the materials is just excellent, especially the approach of adaptation by learners of their natural style rather than an external imposition of some standardised approach”* **\[10\]**. agreement has been reached to include *“highlighted edits from the existing \[e\-learning\] content in the keele/nice sdm resources”* as well as a link enabling learners to access the full package **\[10\]**. the use of these materials by nice will ensure that clinicians across the uk are supported to enact patient choice in the most effective way. as with the dutch gp guidelines, this will not only benefit clinicians by enhancing their professional conduct but will help to realise the nhs’s goal for patients to be active partners in decision\-making, summarised in the well\-publicised phrase: *“no decision about me, without me”* \(department of health, 2012\). 

 toerien and jackson’s pioneering research\-based training in specific, practical communication skills has had a demonstrable, positive impact on medical students’ and practitioners’ ability and willingness to give patients choice. the longevity and reach of the impact has been secured through the e\-learning package and by the uptake of the research findings by high\-profile medical professionals and governing bodies including those with direct responsibility for medical training and guideline development. this ensures that the research will continue to help practitioners – internationally and across medical specialties – transform shared decision\-making from an ideal to a reality in their daily interactions with patients.

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 public bodies, such as health boards or government departments, must reliably interpret evidence to properly inform their decision\-making. illari and clarke’s work explores the diverse types of evidence obtained from biological and social mechanisms and systems, and how these are used for multiple **purposes**. this has impacted on **1\) international** **methodologies for evidence assessment in health** by increasing the **plurality** of evidence they use, particularly **evidence of mechanisms** \(nice, iarc\), and on **2\) uk ethical frameworks for ai and data science** by improving their evidence use, particularly their attention to anticipating and monitoring how systems including populations **react** to new ethics frameworks \(cabinet office, dcms, west midlands police, the nhs\). the beneficiaries are patients who need high quality medical advice both in england and wales and internationally, and all people in the uk affected by government and nhs data projects such as the uk cabinet office framework for data ethics and the nhs code of conduct for data\-driven health and care technology. 
","
###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 phyllis illari’s research has focused on causality, mechanism, and information quality in clinical contexts and the policymaking sphere, arguing in each of these areas that sound approaches to evidence and methods need plural, diverse forms of evidence for multiple *purposes.* for example, the clinic serves a diverse range of purposes, and clinicians benefit from a variety of types of evidence tailored for those different purposes. policymakers, likewise, require different kinds of evidence to inform their interventions, depending on what policy goal they are pursuing. hence evidence cannot be graded and ranked in abstraction from those purposes. 

 illari argues that information quality is fitness for *purpose* \( **\[r1\]**, particularly illari’s sole\-authored chapter\), and hence that information quality is purpose\-specific rather than global. illari’s co\-authored book with russo **\[r2\]** argues for a *pluralist* approach to causality: multiple approaches to causality should be accepted, because they are each useful for different purposes. illari’s co\-edited book on mechanisms **\[r3\]**, shows how the idea of mechanisms can and should extend far beyond biological mechanisms such as dna replication to include also social mechanisms such as stigmatisation; illari’s co\-authored chapter with glennan **\[r3\]** examines the varieties of mechanisms. 

 illari collaborated with brendan clarke as co\-is on the ahrc\-funded ‘evaluating evidence in medicine’ \(ebm\+\) project \( **\[i\],** pi williamson, university of kent, 2015\-2018\). this project studied diverse ways of getting evidence of mechanism, such as of how diseases progress in the body, or how drugs act on targets to stop or inhibit disease progression. the project studied how evidence of the entities and activities of such mechanisms, and their organisation, is gained and used, and created the ebm\+ network of researchers interested in these problems. 

 the core of clarke and illari’s joint work \(in two books **\[r3, r4\]**, and several papers including **\[r5, r6\]**\) is in what they are arguing *against*. clarke and illari oppose a dominant trend in public agencies’ official use of evidence, which prioritises a restricted range of evidence methods, so\-called ‘gold standard’ evidence such as randomised controlled trials \(rcts\). instead, they argue that one single ‘best’ form of evidence cannot address the *plurality* of purposes for which evidence is used. such purposes range from, for example, identifying subpopulations of patients who have different treatment risks, to deciding whether it is justifiable to use a surrogate outcome \(an outcome that is easier to measure than the real target outcome\) in a randomised clinical trial. this focus on purpose and context of use makes even characterising good evidence difficult, but one key finding is that proper *evidence of mechanism* \(of disease causation, mechanisms of actions of drugs, and social mechanisms of health policy\) is needed. 

 clarke and illari’s work **\[r4\]** meets this challenge by providing detailed guidance on evaluating evidence of mechanism alongside the already universally used rct evidence. it also raises a central problem for mechanisms in the context of policy: reactivity—the fact that when mechanisms and systems are acted on, they change. illari first writes about changing experimental systems as a central scientific problem in **\[r2\]**. understanding this is vital to any use of evidence of mechanism and of system by policy bodies, because policy decisions \(including publishing evidence assessment guides or data ethics frameworks\) are actions that the system being governed *reacts* to. after clarke and illari’s joint work, public bodies should use diverse evidence of mechanism or evidence of system to make good policy decisions, but they also need to take account of the fact that any policy decision they make will change that system.

###  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 there is strong public pressure for agencies to make transparent and publicly justifiable decisions about complex questions such as when the identification of potential cancer hazards should trigger a public health response, which rapidly\-emerging technologies and treatments to fund, and how to regulate ai and data driven technologies. the idea that a single, narrow, ‘gold standard’ of evidence is available, and can help public decision\-making is tempting, but illusory **\[r2, r4**, **r6\].** clarke and illari worked alongside practitioners and policy\-makers to impact evidence assessment methods in healthcare, and ethics frameworks for data science and ai in public bodies. their research **\[r4**, **r6\]** increased the **plurality** of evidence taken into account in formal evidence assessment methods in healthcare, including or improving attention to **evidence of mechanism**, increasing the fitness of evidence for multiple **purposes** **\[r1\]**. it also **\[r3**, **r1\]** illuminated where knowledge is crucial, particularly when systems, including populations, **react** to new ai and data science ethics frameworks **\[r2\].** 

 **1\) shaping international methodologies for evidence assessment in health** 

 from 2015\-18, as part of the ‘evaluating evidence in medicine’ \(ebm\+\) **\[i\]** project team at ucl and kent, clarke and illari worked with stakeholders from the international agency for research on cancer \(iarc\) and the national institute for health and care excellence \(nice\). beth shaw, senior technical adviser in the centre for guidelines, michael kelly, retired director of public health, nice, and kurt straif, head of the section of evidence synthesis and classification, iarc, were associate members of the project. this team developed a methodology to show how formal evidence assessment frameworks can take account of evidence of mechanism for multiple purposes. project members then sat on formal consultations with iarc and nice on their methodologies for evidence assessment, and submitted written material to them recommending inclusion of evidence of mechanism. this led to both organisations changing their methods to reflect the project findings; as kelly explains “changes to the methods officially adopted by these extremely influential health agencies are very significant and have global reach” **\[a\]**. these are illustrated below: 

 *iarc*: iarc is the specialized cancer research agency of the world health organization \(who\), responsible for assessing all carcinogenic hazards. iarc’s *preamble to the monographs* is the methodology manual governing how these assessments are performed, and as iarc’s head of the section of evidence synthesis and classification explained “who and national health agencies use this information as scientific support for their actions to prevent exposure to potential carcinogens” **\[b.1\]**. before consulting with ebm\+, iarc included mechanistic evidence in the *preamble*, but it was tentative and secondary to other evidence; by 2017 they confirmed: “the ebm\+ programme has already led us to think in new ways about the nature and kinds of evidence of carcinogenicity and to scrutinize our own approach” **\[b.1\].** this was reflected in the update to the 2006 *preamble* which was published in 2019 and is likely to be used for many years **\[b.2\]**. the project pi represented the project on the international advisory group recommending revisions to the *preamble*, which “led to significant changes in the way mechanistic evidence is evaluated in the new *preamble*, with mechanistic evidence now treated on a par with epidemiological studies on humans and with animal studies. mechanistic evidence thus plays a much more substantial role in the new *preamble* than in previous versions of the *preamble*.” **\[b.3\]** this improves treatment of **evidence of mechanism**, and **plurality** of evidence used. the *preamble* explicitly refers to **\[r4\]**, including its systematic review methods for evidence of mechanism. it now includes much more information about kinds of mechanistic evidence that might be relevant and how to get it. there are many more extended treatments through the second half of the *preamble*, and attention to grading of overall mechanistic evidence in **\[b.2\],** section 6c, reflecting **\[r4\]**. this contribution is deeply and internationally significant: as the *preamble* puts it, “cancer prevention is needed as much today as it was when iarc was established, because the global burden of cancer is high and continues to increase” **\[b.2\]**, p1. by changing iarc’s methodology to improve treatment of evidence of mechanism and plurality of evidence, illari and clarke have thus contributed to robust and responsible public decision\-making in the assessment of cancer risk and prevention. 

 *nice*: nice improves outcomes for all people using the nhs, by providing assessments of the value for money of new technologies and medicines proposed for adoption in the nhs, and evidence\-based guidance for clinicians. nice’s *methods manual* **\[c.1\]** is, as kelly puts it: “core to what it does and how it does it”, **\[a\]** and is used in all assessments of evidence nice runs for medical treatments in england and wales. nice “is a leading health agency internationally, with many european countries simply adopting nice guidelines, and nice influencing pharmaceutical companies”, **\[a\]** and it is copied across the world because, “it is internationally recognized for its independence and methodological rigour” **\[c.2\]**. illari and clarke’s research **\[r2, r4, r6\]** changed the methodology recommended by nice in the methods manual. to change these methods is to shape social policy interventions, domestically through nice’s role in evidence assessment, and internationally through the wider impact of nice’s methods of appraisal. 

 in 2017, nice’s senior technical advisor stated that “the work of the ebm\+ group is helping us to explore the question around the value and use of different types of evidence \(including the use of evidence of mechanisms\), from a multi\-disciplinary perspective, in order to make practice recommendations that are robust and justifiable” **\[c.3\]**. after further consultation by the project team **\[i\]**, evidence of **pluralistic** types, particularly **evidence of mechanism \[r2**, **r4**, **r6\]**, were explicitly recognised in the 2018 manual **\[c.4\],** and remain in the 2020 version **\[c.1\]**. as kelly writes, clarke and illari “worked particularly intensively” on the evidence assessment tables in section 4 \[of **r.4**\] which “connect\[ed\] their theoretical work to evidence assessment processes, particularly those used at nice” **\[r4\]**. kelly explains that “these showed how to incorporate better assessment of evidence of mechanism into existing evidence assessment processes, particularly focusing on the justification of intervention methods and surrogate outcomes used” **\[a\]**. the manual has changed to include “explicit recognition of the importance of combining statistical evidence and evidence of mechanisms” **\[c.2\]**. it now recognises key purposes **\[r1\]** for which evidence of mechanism is required, including for identifying relevantly different sub\-populations and for assessing potential interventions or risks. the former recognises that people do not always react in the same way to a treatment, necessitating assessment of whether trial evidence gained in one population will apply to a different group or a sub\-group \( **\[c.1\]**, p26\) while the latter has led to explicit recognition in the manual of causal mechanisms linking factors to outcomes, and “mechanism of action” of potential treatments as two of nine recommended review questions \( **\[c.1\]**, p58\). mechanism as important to understanding how the medical intervention being assessed works now appears in four other places \( **\[c.1\]**, p62, p63, p72, p113\). finally, there is implicit recognition of evidence of mechanism as important in justifying use of a surrogate outcome in trials in two places \( **c.5** **appendix a**, 2020, p7\), with reference to evidence of process, and of intermediate outcomes. as kelly puts it, “the work of the project increased the presence of evidence of mechanism in the manual from very close to zero, thereby increasing the variety of evidence taken into account, and explicitly acknowledging the importance of evidence of mechanism for particular purposes”. these research\-led changes to iarc and nice methodologies reach an extremely broad population globally: “it includes anyone exposed to a carcinogen, or treated with a pharmaceutical intervention or other treatment, or subject \[to\] a public health improvement” **\[a\]**. 

 **2\) influencing uk ethical frameworks for ai and data science** 

 *cabinet office and the department for digital, culture, media and sport \(dcms\):* in 2014, due to the expertise demonstrated in **\[r1\],** illari was invited onto a months\-long consultation by the cabinet office on the first major ethical framework for government data science. as the co\-chair of the committee writes: “illari’s expertise in information and evidence, *and* in causality and causal inference, is almost unique” \[ **d**\]. this consultation created the 2016 cabinet office framework for data ethics **\[e.1\],** which applied to all government data projects. it was the precursor of the framework still in force with dcms \(2020\) **\[e.2\]**. using attention to purpose **\[r1\]**, illari was “responsible for point f” **\[d\]**, presenting **reactivity** **\[r2\]** as one of 11 key checks that frame the whole document \( **\[e.1\]**, p5, elaborated p12, remaining in force now \( **\[e.2\],** p14\). illari also fed into point d on data quality **\[r1\]**, \( **\[e.1\]**, p5; \( **\[e.2\],** p27\). the co\-chair of the committee explains that “this work probably prevented significant problems in government data science and public sector data projects are supposed to apply this framework to guide their data projects” **\[d\]**. 

 following this, illari was appointed from sept 2016\-20 as a founder member of the data ethics group \(deg\) of the alan turing institute, which is the uk’s flagship institute for data science and ai. the deg has been consulted by many significant uk public bodies, so that, with the deg’s interdisciplinary team, illari has improved attention to **plural evidence** and **reactivity** in national approaches to data ethics. this included informal consultations with dcms on setting up the centre for data ethics and innovation, with the information commissioner’s office, and with police frameworks on predictive policing. illari as part of the deg particularly pressed for serious consultations with stakeholders from minoritized groups, and for the need for all projects to monitor for ongoing evidence of impact on them. 

 in one particularly important case in 2019, nhs england consulted the deg on a code of conduct for data\-driven health and care technology ethics **\[f.1\]**. as the resulting deg report put it, “the code is intended to form the basis for the nhs’s long\-term strategy of developing, procuring and deploying data\-driven tools.” **\[f.2\]** illari and her ucl colleague melanie smallman argued that the code’s focus on individual providers or technologies provided no protection against system\-level harms \( **reactivity** of a system to a policy intervention\) that nhs england had a duty to prevent. instead, there needed to be thorough and sustained attention to “wider social implications of data\-driven and ai technologies on health” **\[f.2\].** instead of the consultation on the code of conduct closing, as planned, they were successful in maintaining a consultative status following the 2019 launch. as the chair of the deg explains, “the civil servants involved are to be commended in taking seriously illari and smallman’s representations, as deg members, that nhsx had a duty to understand and monitor the potential collective effects of the use of technologies which, even if individually ethically reasonable, might collectively create serious harms, especially for vulnerable groups.” **\[d\]** given current covid\-19 circumstances this work is not complete. the chair notes that “the cabinet office, and nhsx, wish to keep a high standard – and *demonstrate* that they are keeping to a high standard – so that public confidence in government and the nhs can be maintained. illari played an important role in advancing this in these consultations” **\[d\]**. furthermore, “she has helped to establish robust practices in public bodies that are more sensitive to evidence, taking into account reactivity, that have raised the quality of data projects in the uk and prevented harm” **\[d\]**. 

 the significance of this contribution extends beyond even all uk government data science and the nhs use of data\-driven tools. these have been crucial years for data ethics and good work is rapidly copied. for example, recent documents on such strategies for the scottish government cite links to the turing institute work. illari’s focus on **pluralistic evidence** of what the system is doing and how we *continue* to know this as it changes is vitally important. both here and in medical methodology this research has wide\-ranging and long\-lasting impact in encouraging and enabling robust and responsible public decision\-making.

##  1. summary of the impact 

 research into energy reduction and ventilation undertaken by the university of strathclyde has improved building performance in scotland and the uk to protect occupant health, save energy and reduce carbon emissions. specifically, since august 2013 it has: 

-  protected occupant health by influencing scottish common law; 

-  shaped uk government policy and public health advice to reduce covid\-19 transmission; and 

-  informed building regulations and industry guidance to improve building performance in scotland and the uk. 
","
##  2. underpinning research 

 while post\-war improvements to housing in the uk have brought many benefits, the drive for warmth and energy efficiency has had unintended consequences for indoor air quality and occupant health. asthma, a chronic disease of the air passages commonly triggered by inhaled substances particles and allergens, has increased six fold in prevalence among scottish children with a significant rise in hospital death rates due to acute incidents. since 2000 researchers at the university of strathclyde have undertaken extensive work to understand causes and how to address these. central to this is the development of effective building design standards and regulation, with a particular focus on ventilation design and occupier behaviour. 

 **housing and health – fuel poverty, dampness, mould and lung function:** building on previous work, **howieson** conducted research on the health implications of fuel poverty and excess winter deaths \(2004\-5\). a subsequent project examined the role played by house conditions in the increasing prevalence of disease. the resulting monograph, covering all aspects of housing design and use, developed a clear focus on the role that planned ventilation can play in suppressing relative humidity – the key driver of house dust mite infestation and allergen generation. the book outlined a range of strategies to tackle the problems inherent in the existing and retro\-fitted housing stock, as well as forging guiding principles for the design of new dwellings, together with a financial assessment of the proposals \[ **r1**\]. 

 further research in collaboration with a team of respiratory consultants and immunologists at gartnavel hospital \(university of glasgow\), a us biotech company and the us environmental protection agency, quantified the effect on lung function of exposure to indoor biological contaminants using the samples taken as part of the initial study. this was done through two studies: a randomised double\-blind placebo\-controlled intervention trial \(2009\) which found that domestic mechanical ventilation with heat recovery \(mvhr\), systems in combination with a range of allergen de\-naturing measures, can improve asthma control by inhibiting re\-colonisation rates \[ **r2**\] and; a cross‐sectional study \(2015\) of non‐smoking, asthmatic adults in scotland that revealed a significant correlation between environmental relative moldiness index \(ermi\) values in the homes and lung function testing, strongly suggesting that asthmatics should avoid high ermi environments \[ **r3**\]. 

 **building energy and environmental performance:** since 2004, **tuohy** has undertaken research into building energy and indoor environmental performance including projects funded by the building research establishment \(bre\) \(2004\-2013\) and scottish government \(2006\-2018\). this research demonstrates inadequacies in current regulatory and industry methods and new methods to address these. having investigated uk regulatory energy and carbon calculation methods, tuohy developed a new design methodology encompassing a capability parameter to quantify robustness and identified root causes for gaps between intended and actual building performance \[ **r4**\]. further research explored processes used in non\-construction benchmark industries and identified quality systems processes from electronics, aerospace and automotive industries that could address the gaps. it was proposed that these bim benchmark industry processes could be easily adopted in a bim framework to routinely deliver comfortable healthy low\-carbon buildings \[ **r5**\]. this study demonstrated the importance of public domain performance data and the need for a quality systems approach to deliver intended performance in practice. 

 **building standards and indoor air quality:** on the basis of their expertise and body of research on indoor air quality and ventilation, **howieson** and **tuohy** were key members of a collaborative research team \(including **sharpe** of glasgow school of art, now strathclyde\) selected by the scottish government building standards division \(bsd\) in 2014 to investigate occupier influence on indoor air quality in dwellings. following a detailed literature review, fieldwork was undertaken to gather quantitative data on occupant interaction with ventilation provision within the homes and undertake more detailed investigations into the effects on indoor air quality. the resulting report highlighted the relative lack of trickle vent use in contemporary housing, pointing to the prioritisation of thermal comfort over moisture and pollutant control, and outlined options for revising the domestic technical handbook guidance to standard 3.14 on natural ventilation \[ **r6**\]. a further study commissioned by bsd into the effectiveness of decentral mechanical extract ventilation was completed in 2018. since april 2020, **sharpe** has drawn on these strathclyde studies to provide research input as a member of the scientific advisory group for emergencies \(sage\) environment and modelling group \(emg\). key insights on ventilation design and use have been incorporated into a series of papers examining various aspects of disease transmission and mitigations in the built environment to inform decision\-making in relation to covid\-19.

##  4. details of the impact 

 by advancing understanding of the causes of poor indoor air quality and how to address its effects, strathclyde research has improved building performance in scotland and the uk to protect occupant health, save energy and reduce carbon emissions. more specifically, it has: 

-  protected occupant health by influencing scottish common law; 

-  shaped uk government policy and public health advice to reduce covid\-19 transmission; and 

-  informed building regulations and industry guidance to improve building performance in scotland and the uk. 

###  protected occupant health by influencing scottish common law 

 as well as shaping professional practice, howieson’s research findings \[ **r1**, **r2**, **r3**\] have prompted public action by raising awareness of the health consequences of poor indoor air quality \(with significant uk media coverage between 2001 and 2009 influencing behaviour and laying the foundation for subsequent changes after august 2013\). a clear example of this is the surge in legal claims being made by tenants against their landlords in scotland. as an expert witness, listed on the scottish legal register under housing and energy, dampness, defects and accidents \(since 1995\), howieson has applied his expertise to approximately 1,500 cases since 2000 \(referrals from over 50 law firms across scotland\) to test and establish the legal responsibility landlords should carry for providing dwellings that have a detrimental impact on occupant health due to mould fungal spore growth, house\-dust mite \(hdm\) infestation, or the sub\-standard energy performance that does not allow the tenant to achieve ‘thermally safe’ indoor temperatures. in support of pursuers claiming health issues due to poor air quality in rental properties, his evidence resulted in several test case wins and multiple out of court settlements that established a legal precedent in common law. confirming this, the principal solicitor and solicitor advocate at conway accident law practice ltd acknowledges that ‘strathclyde’s research on fuel poverty, affordable and dampness free housing, and illnesses associated with damp housing, conducted by dr stirling howieson, has assisted greatly with the prosecution of cases for affected persons claiming both damages and repairs’ \[ **s1**\] *.* referring to the *mcguire v monklands district council* and *burns v monklands district council* test case wins, he notes that it was ‘howieson’s mastery of the issues which effectively ended the previously ubiquitous defence that condensation was the tenant’s fault for failure to heat… it is perhaps a testimony to his reputation that these kind of cases now rarely go to trial if defenders know he has been instructed’ \[ **s1**\]. likewise, affirming that ‘dr howieson has acted as an independent expert witness for my clients tenants in cases all over scotland’, the principal solicitor at lanarkshire accident law notes: ‘dr howieson’s opinions, reports and expertise have had a significant impact over the course of 20 years in my client’s successfully pursuing housing claims… these clients are typically at the lowest end of the socioeconomic spectrum. they have been assisted by dr howieson’s knowledge, skills and expertise in facilitating improvement works to their homes, together with obtaining compensation. in other cases, they have been rehoused…his expertise has been instrumental in helping to shape the common law in relation to the obligations of a landlord’ \[ **s2**\]. 

###  shaped uk government policy and public health advice to reduce covid\-19 transmission 

 sharpe’s expertise around ventilation and health \(recognised as being ‘developed through collaborative research undertaken with the university of strathclyde’\) led to his appointment to the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies \(sage\) as part of the environment and modelling group \(emg\) in april 2020 \[ **s3**\]. comprising 14 members, the emg has developed and assessed the evidence base for the government’s response to the covd\-19 pandemic, particularly around efforts to reduce transmission in buildings. outlining sharpe’s involvement and the value of the group’s work, the uk government chief scientific adviser notes: 

 ‘as a member of the sage emg, prof. sharpe attended 25 meetings between april and december 2020 and contributed his research\-informed expertise to the production of 27 papers relating to covid\-19 transmission, with specific input into a series of 12 papers that have focussed on the role of the built environment generally and ventilation in particular. these research and analysis papers were considered by sage, which drew on the evidence to advise decision makers and support the ongoing government response to coronavirus. attesting to the value of prof. sharpe’s input, the emg paper on the ‘role of ventilation in controlling sars\-cov\-2 transmission’ \(september 2020\) makes specific reference to a building performance and end\-user interaction study undertaken at the university of strathclyde to support statements about user behaviour and the wider consequences of changes to ventilation. these papers have informed government policy and public advice and have also been adopted by a range of industry bodies to provide advice to building owners and managers and the public’ \[ **s3**\]. specific examples highlighted are: 

-  sage emg papers shaped 4 coronavirus \(covid\-19\) advice documents issued by the chartered institution of building service engineers \(cibse\) to provide evolving guidance for building owners/ managers and businesses to facilitate emergence from lockdown \[ **s3**\]. these were updated multiple times during 2020. 

-  principles outlined in ‘emg/spi\-b: mitigating risks of sars\-cov\-2 transmission associated with household social interactions’ \(26 november 2020\) were published on the government website as a standalone, accessible policy paper on 7 december 2020, with links to the household plans endorsed by sage. this informed the uk government, scottish government and welsh government joint statement on staying safe at christmas issued on 16 december 2020 which advised the uk public: ‘if you meet indoors, ensure good ventilation by letting in fresh air’ \[ **s3**\]. 

-  this paper also underpinned the public information campaign launched by the department of health and social care on 18 november 2020. a short video on the risks of transmission in housing showing how coronavirus lingers in enclosed spaces and providing advice on how to keep homes ventilated was widely shared on news channels, via social media and as a download on vimeo.com \(viewed approximately 13,700 times by the end of 2020\) \[ **s3**\]. 

-  the sage\-emg/nervtag paper on the emerging risk of aerosol transmission was referenced by the ministry of housing, communities and local government in response to a house of lords written question on the adequacy of current building regulations and guidance on provision of artificial and natural ventilation, particularly air exchange rates \(uin hl8966, tabled on 9 october 2020\). this indicates the government’s intention to consult on changes to the building regulations ventilation standards, including a number of measures to enhance the ventilation provision for non\-domestic buildings to mitigate the risk of transmission of infectious agents \[ **s3**\]. 

 **informed building regulations and industry guidance to improve building performance** 

 research at strathclyde on issues of ventilation and indoor air quality has informed various changes to statutory building standards and guidance documents. as detailed below, key contributions since august 2013 include informing the development of scottish building standards, enabling a review of scottish government energy standards to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and changing cibse engineering guidelines to reduce humidity levels and promote ventilation use. 

####  scottish building regulations 

 the research commissioned by the scottish government building standards division in december 2013 \[ **r6**\] has been used to inform the development of the scottish building regulations since 2014. according to the head of building standards, ‘the findings of the occupier influence on indoor air quality research project undertaken by strathclyde directly informed the revision of the 2015 building standards. this included changes to the requirements for background ventilation in dwellings and a requirement for co<sub>2</sub> sensors to be installed in all new build homes due to the occupier influence on indoor air quality and this requirement was incorporated into the scottish government domestic technical handbook which came into force on 1 october 2015. all new housing built since this time has been subject to these regulations \(approximately 85,000 new homes built between october 2015 and december 2020\). the strathclyde research report has also been cited and used in the current proposals for amendments to building regulations in england and wales. this also led to further work being commissioned by bsd \(ability of decentralised mechanical ventilation to act as ‘whole\-house’ ventilation systems in new\-build dwellings\) by strathclyde, which is also informing the development of new regulations’ \[ **s4**\]. 

 the new clause \(3.14.2\) on ventilation awareness stipulated that ‘co<sub>2</sub> monitoring equipment should be provided in the apartment expected to be the main or principal bedroom’ to ‘raise occupant awareness of co<sub>2</sub> levels \(and therefore other pollutants\) present in their homes and of the need for them to take proactive measures to increase the ventilation’ \[ **s5**\]. this was accompanied by revised guidance for occupants and has been applied by local authorities \(las\) across scotland, with ongoing advice from the scottish government. for instance, in january 2018, the local government and communities directorate wrote to all la building standards managers reiterating the clause and drawing attention to ‘co<sub>2</sub> monitors on the market that do not meet the objectives of the guidance’ to ensure compliance \[ **s6**\]. 

####  scottish government energy standards 

 by contributing to the ‘low carbon building standards strategy for scotland’ \(2007, with revisions in 2013\), strathclyde research has driven standards and innovation on a wide range of topics, including the delivery of very low carbon buildings in support of climate change objectives. having undertaken research for the scottish building standards agency \(sbsa\) to determine the impact of further limitation of co2 emissions on the costs of new buildings and on scottish construction practice \[ **r4**, **r5**\], tuohy was appointed to the expert panel tasked with advising scottish ministers on measures to improve the energy performance of houses and buildings in scotland and thereby reduce co2 emissions \[ **s7a** p.33\] as noted on the scottish government website, this report ‘was integral to recent review of energy standards, both the 2010 standards and the announcement on 2015 energy standards’ \[ **s8**\]. further recommendations made by the same panel in 2013 \[ **s7b**\] were adopted, leading to the successful implementation of the new standards from october 2015 which enabled the government to make ‘substantial progress in reducing carbon dioxide emissions from both new and existing building stock in scotland’ \[ **s8**\]. this is apparent in the committee for climate change’s 2019 progress report to the scottish parliament which highlighted a 4% reduction in emissions from residential buildings between 2016 and 2017 \(down to 5.9 mtco₂e\), accounting for 15% of total emissions \[ **s9**, p.67\]. 

####  cibse guidance for building service engineers 

 as a member of the cibse health issues task group \(convened in 2005 to advise on changes and additions to cibse guide a: environmental design\), howieson provided key evidence on hdm colonisation and proliferation which led to a significant change in the guidance. on the basis of his housing and asthma research, specifically findings on hdm viability in micro\-climates and the link between hdm and increasing asthma rates \[ **r1**\], howieson successfully argued for a reduction in the recommended relative humidity level from 70% to 60% \[ **s10** pp.5,12\]. this guidance was published as cibse tm40: health issues in building services and incorporated into guide a which is considered ‘the premier reference source for designers of low energy sustainable buildings’ and is used by cibse members \(approximately 21,000\) and other interested parties worldwide \[ **s10** p.3\]. although both documents have been updated since 2006, the humidity level guidance has not changed and remains a core part of the performance criteria for health and comfort in buildings \[ **s10b**\]. by bringing about this change and shaping industry best practice, howieson has informed building service design and management throughout the period to date; alongside his legal work, this has contributed to lowering hdm levels and reducing asthma prevalence.

 1. summary of the impact 

 uea research was the first to demonstrate that long\-term care \(ltc\) for older people is no longer just a priority for rich countries. uea research has **led to the** **identification of ltc as a new global development issue** by the world health organisation and other influential agencies post 2014. 

 as well as catalysing this new policy agenda, uea research substantively shaped it, both globally and nationally, and has generated specific downstream impacts. for example, uea’s finding that ltc is emerging as a leading driver of gender injustice has **influenced agencies such as un women to address the issue for the first time**. the same insights informed interventions in brazil to support female care\-givers, and these have been positively evaluated and extended. 

 similarly, pioneering uea research insights about the rapid expansion of weakly regulated care homes in low and middle\-income countries \(lmics\) and widespread abuses of residents’ human rights has **promoted a rights\-based approach by global agencies and prompted new civil society interventions in argentina**. these have improved care home accountability and reduced residents’ potential exposure to abuse. they have enabled new strategies in mexico and other countries to limit care homes’ vulnerability to the covid\-19 pandemic. 
","
 2. underpinning research 

 long\-term care \(ltc\) refers to support needed by older persons with limited ability to care for themselves due to chronic physical or mental health conditions. it can be provided by families, but also includes interventions by state, private sector and not\-for\-profit organisations. in 2015, 61% of people aged 70\+ \(238 million people\) lived in low and middle\-income countries \(lmics\): this population experiences a high prevalence of disability and care dependency. 

 uea research led by prof peter lloyd\-sherlock has led the way in identifying the scale and rapid emergence of this new policy challenge. it included, in 2001, the first academic publication on ltc in lmics \[r1\]. as part of a comparative analysis of social policy in argentina, thailand and south africa, it found ltc to be a fast\-growing issue. most older people were cared for at home and overwhelmingly by female workforces of unpaid carers. however, non\-family provision was expanding quickly. for example, in 2010 argentina’s union of gerontological service providers claimed the country contained 6,000 care homes. 

 building on this finding, uea research showed these 3 case studies reflected the experiences of other lmics and revealed specific areas of concern \[r2\]. lloyd\-sherlock found substantive differences between ltc policies in most high\-income countries \(hics\) and those in most lmics. hic governments usually offer a broad range of services with a focus on supporting care in family and community settings. by contrast, lmic government intervention is almost entirely restricted to funding small numbers of care homes, reflecting an assumption that family care\-giving requires no external support \[r2\]. this had led to growing numbers of unregulated, informal care homes and a lack of support for growing numbers of unpaid female family carers. as a result, ltc systems in most lmics essentially offer an “all or nothing” choice between unsupported family care and unregulated private provision. 

 **problems of care home regulation and their effects on the quality of care.** 

 uea research demonstrated the limited capacity of state agencies in different lmics to regulate care homes \[r5, r6\]. regulatory responsibility is split between different government agencies \(typically health and social welfare\), operating locally and without coordination. care standards are based on hic best practice, which are unrealistic in resource\-constrained settings and hardly, if ever, enforced. for example, care homes usually have multiple room occupancy \(typically more than 5 people\) which contravenes official requirements. government agencies have minimal engagement with providers, many of which are unregistered and effectively invisible to the authorities. uea research found this reduced accountability between providers and service users, enabling elder abuse and infractions of residents’ human rights \[r5, r6\]. lloyd\-sherlock applied a range of innovative methodologies, including ethical, covert research by local older women, in argentina to reveal care home practices in more depth. this confirmed the abuse of residents’ human rights, including coercive admission, deprivation of liberty and over\-crowding \[r5, grant d\]. 

 these findings indicated the potential vulnerability of care homes in lmics to crises such as covid\-19 and the need for specific strategies. covid\-19 policies applied in hics require adaptation for settings where regulation is absent, resources are limited and multiple room occupancy the norm. based on these findings and with rapid stakeholder collaboration, uea led the development of an original emergency strategy: the coordinate, identify, assess and target \(ciat\) framework. this guides priorities, including closer coordination between agencies, strategies to locate and engage with unregulated care homes, and targeted interventions based on assessed needs. this activity has been supported by an ongoing gcrf/newton agile covid\-19 fund award \(grant a\). 

 **unsupported and unpaid family carers.** 

 in collaboration with researchers in mexico, peru, china and nigeria, as well as king’s college london, uea research examined family caring for highly\-dependent older people. this linked quantitative epidemiological analysis to nested in\-depth qualitative case studies \[grant c\]. the project found a lack of external support for family carers and that caring was associated with opportunity costs, such as foregone paid employment and education. processes of family negotiation over care roles were found to be complex and strongly framed by gender norms, and by power dynamics; both between men and women, but also between different women. the role of “primary carer” was often appropriated by more powerful family members who would delegate daily care work to less powerful ones \[r3\]. carers had little knowledge about the specific demands of elder care and received no support from local health or social welfare agencies. this increased their vulnerability, as well as that of the cared\-for older people. 

 informed by these insights, uea research explored interventions to address the vulnerabilities of family carers and older people. this included an mrc\-funded study of a novel intervention based on uea research in brazil \[r4, grant b\]. this trains and pays a basic wage to women from poor neighbourhoods to support family carers and liaise with local health agencies. the intervention was found to reduce carer stress, enhance quality of life for older people and reduce the unnecessary use of health services. it was demonstrated to be a feasible intervention of high potential value to other cities across brazil.

 4. details of the impact 

 **prompting who and other un agencies to engage with ltc as a priority issue.** 

 uea research was instrumental in who’s pioneering prioritisation of long\-term care \(ltc\) as a global development issue. it also influenced other agencies to engage with ltc for the first time. in 2020, it had specific impact on global agencies’ responses to covid\-19. 

 according to the former director of the who department of ageing and life couse \(2010\-2018\): *“peter’s \[lloyd\-sherlock\] research demonstrated to me that these were no longer just issues of importance to relatively affluent countries, but had become a global concern and that who should play a leading role in shaping this new agenda”* \[s1\]. this led who to devote a substantial chapter on ltc in its flagship 2015 world report on ageing and health for which lloyd\-sherlock was the core author \[s2\]. this was the first report by any global agency to present ltc as a global challenge and states: *“in the 21st century, no country can afford not to have a comprehensive system of long\-term care… in low\- and middle\-income countries, the challenge may be to build a system where one does not already exist.”* \[s2\]. the report emphasises \(i\) a rapid increase in ltc demand in lmics \[r1, r2\], \(ii\) important implications for gender justice \[r3\], and \(iii\) an urgent need for policies to support unpaid family carers and to strengthen regulation of private services \[r2, r3, r5, s2\]. 

 the 2015 report shaped subsequent who activities relating to older people. according to the former director of the who department of ageing and life couse: 

 *“the world report on ageing and health has been highly influential and has stimulated government action globally and has gone on to shape who's ongoing activities in this area, including our global strategy and action plan on ageing and health”* \[s1\] **. 

 one of the 5 strategic objectives for who’s global strategy for older people is: *“developing sustainable and equitable systems for providing long\-term care”* \(including home, communities and institutions\), and including *“freeing women to pursue what they value”* \[r3; s3\]. this was followed by the recognition of ltc as a global priority for the who’s decade of action on healthy ageing \(daha\), ratified by the world health assembly in 2020. the 2020 launch document reiterates every country should have a ltc system, adding: *“current approaches to providing ltc rely heavily on informal care –predominantly families and notably women, who may not have the necessary training or support…”* \[r1, r2, r3; s4\]. the daha was ratified by the united nations general assembly in 2020, which commits all un agencies to support global ltc policies under who leadership. 

 uea research on ltc has influenced other un agencies. for example, it led to un women highlighting the global importance of ltc for the first time in its flagship report, “progress of the world's women 2019–2020: families in a changing world” \[s5a\]. according to chief of research and data at un women \(2013\-2020\): 

 *“peter’s work brought to my attention for the first time the wide range of social development challenges being posed by population ageing in low and middle\-income countries \(lmics\)...* \[and\] *enabled un women to develop a more nuanced appreciation about gender justice and care… the need to avoid an all or nothing choice between unsupported family care and poor quality nursing homes through the development of new interventions to support unpaid carers… all of these issues featured prominently in un women’s 2019 flagship report and have continued to influence the organisation’s own thinking… i believe this has prompted an overdue process of reframing global policy discourse about these issues.”* \[s5b\] 

 in the context of the covid\-19 pandemic, uea research influenced who’s technical guidance for managing covid\-19 in care homes which is expected to be followed by all un member states \[s6\]. lloyd\-sherlock was on the scientific expert committee for the first version of the guidance published in march 2020. the guidance drew on uea research to consider specific lmic issues, such as a lack of space for case isolation and a need for enhanced regulatory coordination. lloyd\-sherlock was an external peer reviewer for the revised technical guidance which was launched in january 2021. this draws on uea research, referring to a need for “a mechanism to support unregulated providers” and to other elements of the ciat framework. 

 **influencing and supporting care home regulation by government and civil society.** 

 specific local and national impacts have been achieved in argentina, drawing on uea’s in\-depth research in that country. these impacts have started to inform actions in other countries, including mexico \[s8\], a process accelerated by the covid\-19 pandemic. 

 uea research led to the inclusion of several novel elements in a revised argentina ministry of health regulatory protocol. for example, it is the first such protocol in any lmic to address coercive care home admission as a potential deprivation of liberty \[s10a\] 

 uea insights about the limited capacity of governments to regulate care homes prompted the development of a pioneering new civil society intervention. a public meeting disseminating uea research in the city of la plata led to the establishment of a coalition of government agencies, ngos, academics and care home operators. this coalition developed an interactive online platform providing information and feedback about the city’s regulated and unregulated care homes \(red mayor la plata\). this site, the first of its kind in an lmic, was receiving over 12,000 hits and over 50 messages each month by the end of its first year of operation. messages include examples of abuse \(to quote directly from one message\): *“i found my mother lying naked on the floor, with nobody trying to help her…. they over\-medicate the residents”* \[s7\]. these were followed up and led to official investigation of the providers in question \[s10a\]. in 2020, this intervention won a ukri healthy longevity global grand challenge award, which is providing funds and expert support to extend and scale up the intervention in other cities \[grant d\]. 

 since the covid\-19 pandemic, policy\-makers in lmics have looked to improve regulation and engagement with care homes. a core element of the ciat framework \[r6\] is rapid mapping of all care homes \(including previously unregistered ones\) and realistic forms of engagement. this contributed to a decision by buenos aires province to offer an informal amnesty to care homes not complying with less essential pre\-covid\-19 standards in exchange for their cooperation during the pandemic \[s10b\]. 

 the ongoing development of the ciat framework is both drawing on and feeding back into the practice of government agencies beyond argentina. for example, the director of mexico city government’s lead agency for care homes stated: 

 *“…we consider the ciat framework… highly relevant to the challenging context of mexico city... many long\-term care facilities are not registered with official agencies and so we took specific measures to update our registers and to include new service providers. this has enhanced our capacity to engage with different care homes, including those which operate more informally and which may be more vulnerable to the pandemic. the ciat framework has also informed our strategy of monitoring the situation in these facilities, developing a more robust information base and in identifying different types of targeted interventions* \[such as more intensive surveillance and additional access to testing\] *based on the experiences of other cities in developing countries.”* \[s8\] 

 **influencing government policy and interventions to support family carers.** 

 uea research on family caring and gendered aspects of ltc has directly influenced government policy at the national and local levels. for example, since 2014 over 3,000 families in poor neighbourhoods of belo horizonte, brazil have benefitted from an innovative care\-support intervention, programa maior cuidado \(pmc – older person’s care programme\). pmc was established in 2011, in response to brazil’s first national report on ltc. this report, published by the leading federal government policy think\-tank \(ipea\) in 2010, extensively cites uea research \[r2\] highlighting the gendered impacts of caring for older people and the need to support family care. 

 pmc families receive support from pmc trained carers \(mainly women recruited from similar communities and paid a basic wage\). these carers offer families respite from daily caring and help to develop their competencies in caring. uea researchers conducted impact and process assessments of pmc, the publication of which was delayed by the covid\-19 pandemic. preliminary results shared with government stakeholders influenced a decision in 2019 to convert this temporary project into a permanent one and to extend it across the city \[s9\]. based on the uea research, other local governments, including the cities of fortaleza and contagem, have been persuaded to initiate similar interventions, and the federal ministry of health presents it as a model of good practice in national policy forums \[s9\].

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 wilson’s research has been instrumental in maintaining trust in the use of confidential patient information in the nhs. it has led to changes in the way that core concepts such as confidentiality, implied consent, and public interest are interpreted by healthcare professionals, national\-level committees, and the national data guardian. wilson’s research\-based ethical advice contributed materially to: the prevention of the implementation of the care.data project, thereby helping to protect the privacy of all english gp patients \(2014\); an information commissioner’s office \(ico\) finding that google deepmind and royal free had breached the data protection act \(2017\); the withdrawal of an mou between the home office and nhs digital, preventing the mis\-use of patient data for immigration control purposes \(2018\); and the adoption across the nhs of a new principle for the use of data \(2020\). 
","
###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 in a series of papers, wilson rigorously analysed how health data can be used more effectively for the purposes of delivering care to patients, and to improve population health, while respecting duties of privacy and confidentiality \[ **r1, r2, r3, r4**\]. he argued that the state’s duties to protect and promote health should be articulated through the right to public health, and that this is the best way to reconcile the value of health with other values such as liberty and autonomy. \[ **r1**\] on this view, states which fail to take easy steps to reduce socially controllable threats to health violate their citizens' rights. ways that states can violate this right include failing to collect the data necessary to facilitate public health planning. wilson also argued that citizens’ reasonable expectations play a significantly larger role in justifying the shape and limits of state activity than has often been appreciated. in line with this account, wilson developed a public value account for the nhs, which provides a reconciliation of the public interest in maintaining confidentiality and public trust, with the benefits that can come through commercial partnerships and sale of data. \[ **r5**\] 

 underpinning research was supported by grants from epsrc \[ **ii**\], nhs digital \[ **iii**\], and a secondment to the royal society’s science policy centre \[ **i**\]. wilson was pi for \[ **ii**\], which provided an ethics framework for the gbp11,000,000 i\-sense agile early warning sensing systems for infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance collaboration. wilson’s project examined how to build and maintain public trust in the context of novel mechanisms of disease surveillance such as the ethics of the use of twitter data for disease detection. the project showed that much of the philosophical discussion so far has presupposed some implausible assumptions about what it is to waive a right, and that the concept of reasonable expectations is crucial for clarifying what counts as a violation of the right to privacy in a range of crucial cases involving inferring private information from public information. \[ **r3**\] 

 this account of privacy and reasonable expectations was crucial for advice wilson provided to the national data guardian for health and social care \(ndg\), dame fiona caldicott, in a high\-profile case about the nature and limits of implied consent. resolving the case made clear that a theoretical clarification of the nature of implied consent was necessary. with the ndg’s encouragement, wilson fundamentally rethought the normative underpinnings of medical confidentiality \[ **r4**\], arguing that much of the role that had previously been assigned within guidance to implied consent should be assigned to reasonable expectations.

###  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 patient data is essential for the effective functioning of the nhs. all users of nhs services, and all health professionals benefit from a system of governance that ensures patient data is used only in ways that appropriately balance the need for confidentiality against the benefits to be obtained from wider usage of data for research and service planning. wilson’s research based ethical advice has been instrumental in maintaining trust in the use of confidential patient information in the nhs, contributing materially to: the prevention of the implementation of the nhs care.data project, thereby helping to protect the privacy of all english gp patients \(2014\); an information commissioner’s office \(ico\) finding that google deepmind and royal free had breached the data protection act \(2017\); the withdrawal of an mou between the home office and nhs digital, thus preventing the mis\-use of patient data for immigration control purposes \(2018\); and the adoption across the nhs of a reasonable expectations principle for the use of data \(2020\). 

 **maintaining public trust in nhs digital’s data disseminations.** wilson’s research was a key resource in preventing the implementation of the care.data project. care.data was proposed to harvest data on every individual patient from english gp practices into a central database, without either anonymisation or allowing patients to opt out. wilson was the ethicist for nhsd’s general practice extraction service independent advisory group \(gpes iag\), which was tasked with providing independent advice on whether the project was in the public interest. drawing on his work on the ethics of risk imposition \[ **r2**\], wilson “led the development of the gpes iag public interest model”. \[ **a**\] as the then chair of gpes iag explains, this model “underpinned gpes iag processes and recommendations” and “was instrumental in the group articulating its concerns about why care.data did not appear to be in the public interest.” \[ **a**\] gpes iag’s role in opposing the policy was recognised by the parliamentary office of science and technology’s postnote 474, the subsequent health select committee inquiry, and by the medical privacy ngo medconfidential, which described gpes iag as “the one single body that stood up to care.data”. \[ **b**\] care.data was “paused” in february 2014, and then finally abandoned in 2016. wilson’s expertise was further recognised when in 2015 he was invited to become an independent member of nhsd’s data access advisory group \(daag\), which advised nhsd on how to maintain public trust in their data disseminations. the then chair of gpes iag, who also served as chair of daag, states that wilson’s contribution was “consistently valuable” \[ **a**\], bringing “increased rigour”, and “greater attention to the achievement of public benefits”. the committee’s advice contributed to a “wholesale move away from the use of confidential patient information for the routine planning, monitoring, and reimbursement of health and care services”, which “improved the protection of the confidentiality and privacy of millions of nhs patients’ records, without detriment to services.” \[ **a**\] in 2016, he was chosen as “a leading academic in the ethics of data sharing” \[ **c**\] to help nhsd to transition daag into a fully independent oversight group, the independent group advising on the release of data \(igard\), and was igard’s ethicist \(2017–18\). nhsd’s chief medical officer estimates that the work wilson did with igard to maintain public trust and improve the ability of nhs data to improve patient outcomes benefited “hundreds of thousands of patients.” \[ **c**\] 

 **advice to ndg on ethics, confidentiality, consent, and maintaining public trust in the nhs.** wilson was appointed to the ndg’s panel in 2016, “principally in virtue of his experience and contributions as an academic philosopher and ethicist” \[ndg for health and care, in **d**\]. wilson was the first philosopher to be appointed to the ndg panel, and as ndg relates, she “soon came to recognise that we had made an excellent decision in deciding, in general, to have an academic ethicist and philosopher on the panel and specifically, to recruit wilson, due to the contributions that he has made individually.” \[ **d**\]. in 2018 wilson joined the ndg’s steering group, which is a smaller group of closer advisers. wilson has regularly represented ndg in national level meetings, and occasionally at ministerial level meetings such as a roundtable on artificial intelligence on 28 february 2018, and the global digital health partnership \(with directors general and ministers from twenty different countries\) on ai and health in september 2018. \[ **d**\] 

 **specifying the limits of implied consent through the concept of reasonable expectations.** 

 wilson was key to the formation of the ndg position on implied consent and the common law duty of confidence from 2016 onwards. in one crucial case, royal free london nhs foundation trust shared the records of 1.6 million nhs patients with google deepmind for the development and testing of an app for detecting acute kidney injury. royal free claimed to have done so on the basis of patients’ implied consent, despite the fact that at the time that the data was shared, no steps were taken to make patients aware of this fact. the case was complex, and raised an important point of principle about the circumstances in which it is legitimate to infer that a patient has consented to disclosure of information. wilson, as a member of the ndg panel, met senior representatives from royal free and deepmind on three occasions, in order to come to a considered judgement. ndg was subsequently asked by the information commissioner to give advice as part of a formal investigation into whether the data protection act had been breached. \[ **d**\] wilson, together with fellow ndg panel member mark taylor, argued that reasonable expectations are crucial in distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate uses of implied consent. \[ **r3, r4**\] as ndg explains, “wilson significantly influenced the emphasis that i laid on the relevance of the legal concept of 'reasonable expectations’ in this case and in later work”. \[ **d**\] wilson’s advice was crucial for shaping the ndg’s response to the information commissioner—namely that as the data usage by royal free was not in line with patients’ reasonable expectations, it therefore could not plausibly be claimed that patients had consented to it. \[ **d**\] this advice led directly to the finding by the information commissioner’s office that the royal free had breached the data protection act. \[ **e**\] as the chair of the health research authority explains, wilson’s analysis was also deeply influential with the health research authority \(hra\): “the hra accepted the conclusions of his work and built its regulatory response upon it. i chaired a multi\-agency meeting in which the implications were worked through, all predicated on the analysis that professor wilson had developed. professor wilson’s work on this specific issue has had a very wide impact on data governance in the nhs.” \[ **f**\] 

 **new reasonable expectations principle for information use in the nhs.** wilson published \[ **r4**\], which provided ndg with the “intellectual underpinning” \[ **d**\] for the introduction of a new reasonable expectations principle for data use within the nhs. in a 2019 press release, the ndg praised \[ **r4**\] as “a very convincing article which outlines the importance of reasonable expectations and explores how this principle might be used to support appropriate information sharing.” \[ **g**\] ndg undertook a national consultation in 2020 on whether a new reasonable expectations principle should be adopted across the nhs. the consultation document explicitly mentions how \[ **r4**\] influenced the ndg position. \[ **h**\] consultation respondents were overwhelmingly in favour, and the new principle published in december 2020. \[ **h**\] 

 **change to government policy on the use of nhs data for immigration enforcement.** wilson’s contribution was important for shaping the line taken by the ndg for the health select committee inquiry on the memorandum of understanding \(mou\) between nhsd and the home office \(2017–18\), and through that changing government policy. the mou allowed demographic information held by nhsd to be used for the purposes of tracing immigration offenders. while it was not illegal for nhsd to share patient information in this way, doing so was thought to be incompatible with the general medical council’s \(gmc\) confidentiality guidance. gmc is the regulatory body for doctors, and so any doctor who was involved with decision\-making about individual cases under the mou would potentially be subject to censure and even to being struck off. it was nonetheless a policy that the home office, and nhsd claimed to be in the public interest. wilson argued that nhsd’s public interest test was deeply flawed. both nhsd’s most senior advisers on ethics and confidentiality—its caldicott guardian and deputy caldicott guardian—were doctors. thus, neither could be involved in the decision\-making about individual cases required under the mou, because of the risk of their breaching the gmc confidentiality code. nhsd’s solution was to remove the caldicott guardian and his deputy from its processes for determining the public interest in individual cases. wilson argued this amounted to excluding the very persons who through institutional role and expertise would be best placed to determine the balance of public interest from making their contribution. as ndg explains, wilson’s argument “became a central plank of the view i provided to the committee” \[ **d**\] and proved influential. wilson’s argument was quoted prominently in the letter sent by the chair of the health select committee to the ceo of nhsd on 29 january 2018, requesting that nhsd immediately withdraw from the mou. \[ **i**\] it is quoted again on p. 23 of the subsequent health and social care committee report. \[ **i**\] on 9 may 2018, the government announced that the memorandum would be withdrawn and revised, reducing the number of cases that would fall under it by over 90%. \[ **i**\] wilson was then asked to address a private meeting of nhsd’s board on 5 june 2018, which focused on how the organisation might respond to the ethical criticisms made against it. as nhsd’s then chief medical officer and caldicott guardian explains, nhsd’s board “wanted a renowned expert in the field to advise them” and that wilson’s name “came up from multiple sources as someone whose body of work had the potential to educate and advise the board of a national body on the way forward… the impact was a change in organisational structure and adherence to \[wilson’s\] advice.” \[ **c**\] 

 **nhs covid\-19 app ethics advisory board.** wilson was a member of the ethics advisory board \(eab\) for the nhs covid\-19 app in 2020. the project was extremely high\-profile, as it was initially envisaged in the government’s strategy that the app would play the leading role in controlling the spread of coronavirus. the board’s advice and challenge was widely discussed, including in parliament, on the radio 4 *today programme*, and was covered extensively in *the telegraph* and *the guardian* and other newspapers *.* eab’s main formal output was a letter to the secretary of state for health on 24 april 2020, which laid out six principles and a framework for meeting the objectives of effective control of the epidemic and protecting privacy. the eab chair confirms that “wilson was the most influential member in crafting the ethical principles that we established”, and explicitly recognises how wilson’s work on public value and on public health ethics shaped the principles. \[ **f**\] eab’s principles were warmly welcomed by the government, which committed to follow them \[ **j**\], and that these principles would be “the basis by which any future change requests for the app will be assessed.” \[ **j**\] wilson continued to advise on behalf of ndg in the lead up to the launch of the second iteration of the app. a number of changes were made to the privacy information provided for app users on the basis of his advice, including making clear that “despite the anonymity of the alerts delivered through the app, users might sometimes be able to infer who among their contacts had tested positive for covid”. \[ **g**\] as ndg makes clear, his advice “significantly influenced” her decision to endorse the app \[ **g**\] which had been downloaded over 20 million times by the end of 2020. \[ **f**\]

###  1. summary of the impact 

 we all sit too much. spending long periods of time sitting increases rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, mental health issues and all\-cause mortality. researchers at the university of leicester tackled this growing health problem through the creation and implementation of the freely available stand more at work \(smart work\) programme, enabling organisations and individuals worldwide to reduce sitting and move more at work. this programme and unique underpinning research have changed clinical guidelines, informed national initiatives and facilitated the development of self\-monitoring tools such as the fitbit movement reminder and sit\-stand desks for ikea. 
","
###  2. underpinning research 

 leicester sedentary behaviour researchers \(lsbrs\), led by edwardson and yates, began with three main aims: 

 i. understand the role of sedentary behaviour on morbidity and mortality. 

 ii. examine the health effects of reducing and breaking sitting time with light physical activity. 

 iii. develop and test the effectiveness and cost\-effectiveness of free\-living sitting reduction interventions on behaviour, health and work outcomes 

 the need for this research was clear and supported by gbp7,000,000 in funding from the nihr, department of health and mrc **\[g1–g3\]**.ground\-breaking systematic reviews and meta\-analyses published by lsbrs in 2012 \(\~2000 citations\) demonstrated that people with high levels of sedentary behaviour had an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all\-cause mortality **\[r1, r2\].** from this point, lsbrs have remained at the forefront internationally in furthering understanding of the relationship between sedentary behaviour, particularly when measured by wearable devices \(i.e., accelerometers\), and cardiometabolic health. 

 epidemiological evidence published by lsbrs, showed that device\-assessed sedentary time was positively associated with two\-hour glucose, triglycerides, adiposity, mri\-assessed heart, liver and visceral fat, inflammation, all\-cause mortality and negatively with hdl cholesterol **\[r3, r4, r5, g2, g3\]**. importantly, their research showed a substantially higher risk of death with ≥9.5 hours/day of device\-assessed sedentary time; >60,000 downloads; altmetric score 2586 \(top 5% and listed in the 2019 altmetric top 100 list\) **\[r5\]**. these outputs comprise part of the suite of epidemiological research conducted by lsbrs which has generated new hypotheses for experimental and intervention research globally.lsbrs validated their epidemiological observations via a series of acute experimental studies. these confirmed that reducing sitting time across the day through short, frequent bouts of light activity \(standing, walking and arm ergometry for five minutes every half hour\) considerably improved markers of diabetes and identified key groups that would benefit more from such an intervention; females, south asians, those with lower fitness levels or higher bmi **\[r6, g2,g3\]**. 

 building on this evidence, lsbrs collaborated with researchers at loughborough university to develop a sitting reduction intervention: smart work \(stand more at work\). the programme aimed to reduce sitting time by 60 minutes per day and targeted one of the most sedentary populations: office workers. the randomised controlled trial was funded by the department of health policy research programme **\[g1\]** and remains one of the largest of its kind internationally **\[r7\].** results demonstrated that provision of education, height\-adjustable workstations and additional behaviour change strategies led to large reductions \(83 min/day\) in sitting time after 12 months. these positive changes also gave demonstrable quality of life improvements, reductions in musculoskeletal issues and improvements in self\-reported job performance, work engagement, occupational recovery and sickness presenteeism; >50,000 downloads; altmetric score 589 \(top 5%\); news outlets 43 **\[r7\]**. the cost\-benefit analysis showed a potential return on investment of gbp3 on every gbp1 spent as a result of increased productivity of 1.75 hours per week—a net saving of gbp1,770.32 per employee **\[r8\].** due to the success of the intervention, it was scaled up for rollout nationally and internationally.

###  4. details of the impact 

 lsbr's research has affected global change across a wide range of areas. their work has defined guidelines, changed working practices, improved occupational health, and enabled individuals to make effective behaviour change. 

 **changing guidelines** 

 as a result of their established expertise and demonstrable success, lsbrs were invited to provide expert contributions to the first ever expert statement on sedentary behaviour levels in the workplace ‘the sedentary office’. this statement \(>130,000 downloads; altmetric score 1201 \(top 5%\); news outlets 97\), recommended that workers should aim to spend 50% of their working day upright and was aimed primarily at employers and staff working in office environments but has also been utilised by ergonomists, office furniture and equipment suppliers and occupational health promoters **\[e1\]**. 

 the expert statement provided impetus for widespread changes to clinical practice and working guidelines for which lsbr provided pivotal guidance and evidence. in 2019, the uk chief medical officer published new ‘uk physical activity guidelines’ for which yates provided expertise as a member of the sedentary behaviour expert working group. lsbr research provides much of the evidence for the guidance and specifically underpins the recommendation to interrupt prolonged periods of sitting with light physical activity **\[e2\]**. furthermore, dempsey is a member of the guideline development group that updated the world health organisation’s physical activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines for 2020 **\[e3\]**. 

 lsbr research has also gone on to underpin international guidelines and position statements covering sedentary behaviour. this includes: the dutch physical activity guidelines 2017; physical activity/exercise and diabetes position statement of the american diabetes association 2016; the 2018 usa physical activity guidelines; the canadian 24\-hour movement guidelines for adults; the world health organisation’s guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour 2020; recommended interventions for increased physical activity among office workers by the swedish department for public health 2019; the national heart foundation of australia’s ‘blueprint for active australia’ 2019 **;** the american cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention; the european association of preventive cardiology position statement on exercise training for patients with t2dm and cardiovascular disease; the joint statement of the british and canadian associations of cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation; the international council for cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation; and the british association of sport and exercise sciences on 'acute glycaemic management before, during and after exercise for cardiac rehabilitation participants with diabetes mellitus' **\[e4\]**. 

 **improving occupational health** 

 in 2019, the smart work programme was launched online \(rebranded smart work and life in late 2020\). building on the successful smart work intervention **\[r7, r8\]** the programme is freely available for use by organisations, workplace champions or individual employees **\[e5\]**. it consists of online education, motivational posters, sitting less challenges, suggestions for environmental changes, free self\-monitoring tools, action plans, case studies, top tips and a step\-by\-step guide for effective implementation. to date, employees from >225 national and international \(australia, new zealand, usa, canada, europe\) organisations have signed up. these organisations include: caterpillar uk ltd., 30 councils across england, nhs trusts, pharmaceutical companies \(e.g., sanofi\), universities, and government agencies \(e.g., hmrc\). furthermore, this programme has been endorsed by three height\-adjustable desk provider companies, including posturite, sit\-stand.com \(through activeworking.com\), and coi total interiors and is being promoted on their websites, through their newsletters, blogs and webinars. the programme has also featured on the affinity health at work’s website and social media, workspace design and build through an invited blog, in the institution of occupational health and safety \(iosh; a global organisation for health and safety individuals\) news stories and a featured blog, and on bbc radio leicester. edwardson was also an invited speaker at the health and safety executive \(one of the uk government agencies responsible for workplace health\) **\[e6\]**. 

 **enabling individuals to make effective change** 

 fitbit is the world leader in wearable physical activity trackers with over 29,570,000 active users worldwide. a core function common across the entire fitbit product portfolio is step counting and in 2016 they introduced a vibration reminder to the user should they be sedentary for too long to achieve at least 250 steps per hour. fitbit introduced this feature as a direct result of lsbr research linking sedentary time to increased risk of chronic disease and reduced cardiometabolic health **\[e7\]**. 

 in 2016, lsbr research also enabled and underpinned the development and release of the outstanding google chrome extension. outstanding analyses computer input to determine levels of sitting and provide break reminders and cites lsbr research as both its inspiration and the evidence base **\[e8\].** this has had \~500 downloads. 

 as a result of the meta\-analyses published in 2012 **\[r1, r2\]**, lsbr were invited, in 2013, by the global business leader of the workspace range of ikea, sweden, to attend and present at a workshop on the impact of sitting on health and to explore with them ways to reduce sitting with workspace furnishings and ways of working. this workshop included lsbr, a potential furnishing supplier and ikea leaders. the main output of the workshop was ideas for a range development and a case for manufacturing workspace furnishings to reduce sitting at scale **\[e9\]**. subsequently, in late 2014, ikea released its first range of motorised sit\-stand desks \(bekant range\). these desks are proving popular with 21 desks now in the bekant range and eight in the idasen range, with sales of these desks increasing by 15% during 2019 **\[e9\]**. 

 ‘the sedentary office’ fed into the development of a desk control app by linak \(>50,000 downloads on the google play store\), which pairs with electric sit\-stand desks and provides reminders to change posture from sit to stand and vice versa and provides feedback on standing time **\[e10\]**. 

 lsbr research has also inspired the design of a chair launched by movably in 2020 \(with lsbr meta\-analysis results highlighted on their homepage\), which enables the user to switch between a seated and standing position and when standing, stand more comfortably. the associated app provides feedback on time spent sitting and standing and number of posture changes **\[e11\]**.

###  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 mental health problems affect one in four people in the uk and globally. three\-quarters of lifetime mental illness \(excluding dementia\) starts before people reach their mid\-20s, often with adverse consequences for many years thereafter. research over many years by the care policy and evaluation centre \(cpec, formerly pssru\) at lse, particularly focused on economic aspects of, and responses to, mental illness, has informed national and international policy discussions and fed evidence \(sometimes accompanied by toolkits\) into local decisions by health and care bodies, as well as into other sectors such as schools, workplaces, and the community and voluntary sector. in turn, this lse research has contributed to efforts to prevent mental health problems emerging and to improve the lives of people who experience mental illness. 
","
###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 impacts described here are underpinned by a body of research work undertaken by the care policy and evaluation centre \(cpec; formerly pssru\) at lse. cpec research on mental health and wellbeing includes a prominent economics theme, alongside other perspectives and contributions. the team examine a broad range of economic and other causes and consequences of mental illness, evaluate preventative and ameliorative actions, develop tools to support informed decision\-making, and work with a wide range of policy and practice communities to support implementation of the findings. cpec work spans the life\-course. 

 research on economic consequences of **perinatal maternal mental illness**, funded by comic relief in partnership with the maternal mental health alliance, estimated a uk cost of gbp8.1 billion, leading to further work commissioned by nhs england \(nhse\) on prevention and better treatment. a high proportion of this cost stems from adverse impacts on the cognitive, emotional, and behavioural development of children, often extending over many years into adulthood. the research demonstrated how interventions can help women recover from mental illness or prevent these problems altogether during pregnancy or in the early months following childbirth, generating important health and quality of life gains, as well as large financial benefits for the health, social care, education, employment, and welfare benefits sectors **\[1\] \[2\]**. 

 cpec developed economic evaluation tools and guidance \(“preventonomics *”*\) to help local bodies make early assessments of interventions for **parents and children aged 0\-3** to improve child outcomes as part of the big lottery fund’s *a better start* initiative, and to help understand costs and potential downstream savings **\[3\]**. subsequently, the big lottery fund commissioned a common outcomes framework for economic analysis for use across localities. an economic evaluation template to analyse value for money and break\-even points for interventions was also developed for the headstart initiative, working at six sites across england. 

 cpec work in **public mental health,** commissioned by public health england \(phe\), included the generation of new economic evidence on investing in effective mental illness prevention to support local public health, social care, and nhs decision\-making, and also made the case for investments in workplaces, schools, and communities. this research reviewed effectiveness evidence, calculated cost and cost\-effectiveness implications, and produced a return\-on\-investment tool covering eight different interventions and an accompanying guide for commissioners **\[4\]**. 

 this study found strong economic arguments for interventions in *schools* \(anti\-bullying programmes; social and emotional learning\), *workplaces* \(wellbeing programmes; stress alleviation\), *health care settings* \(collaborative care approaches in the community; better assessment of individuals presenting at accident and emergency departments\), and *communities* \(loneliness alleviation for older people; debt and welfare advice\). the quality of life and economic case for action is particularly strong for school\-based social and emotional learning, and suicide prevention through better liaison between different parts of the nhs. this study built on two earlier cpec studies commissioned by the department of health, one in 2011 which analysed the scale and distribution of costs and pay\-offs for 15 preventative and early interventions **\[5\]**, and the other in 2014 which focused on interventions that promoted recovery for people with psychosis **\[6\]**. 

 building partly on this work, cpec prepared a framework report on the economic and wider case for investment in youth mental health for the world economic forum and orygen \(a leading ngo in the area\), including an illustrative investment case for suicide prevention in korea **\[7\]**. 

 research for the campaign to end loneliness found that for every gbp1 spent in preventing loneliness for older people, there are gbp3 of savings, spread across sectors. cpec had previously conducted a major evidence review and synthesis to inform development of national institute for health and care excellence \(nice\) guidance on promotion of mental health and independence in older people, particularly highlighting the value of interventions that addressed social isolation and loneliness **\[8\]**.

###  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 cpec research has had impacts at three levels: national and international policy discussion and practice, and on local practice decisions, including tool development. 

 **national policy** 

 findings on **long\-term costs of perinatal maternal mental illness** **\[2\]** have provided an evidence base which has underpinned government decisions to increase public spending in this area. the 2014 report **\[2\]** was launched at the palace of westminster \(october 2014\), with two government ministers responding \(one also referring to her own experience with postnatal depression\) **\[a\]**, and considerable media attention \(e.g. *the guardian* front page\). the work influenced the chancellor of the exchequer’s decision to allocate gbp75 million in his 2015 budget to support mothers with perinatal mental illness **\[b\]**. in early 2016, the prime minister announced additional planned spending of gbp290 million for specialist support for mothers during pregnancy and after birth **\[c\]**. the findings continued to be cited in the uk \(e.g. itv news highlighted the cost of not treating perinatal mental illness\) and internationally. local nhs trusts use cpec cost calculations to understand the impacts of perinatal maternal mental illness in their areas \(e.g. nhs wolverhampton clinical commissioning group\). bauer was asked to join nhse’s perinatal clinical reference group \(crg\) research priorities group, and has since established and led an economics subgroup advising on research to inform intervention spending. the maternal mental health alliance continues to use the findings from this study in its national campaigning. 

 the work **\[2\]** was cited in the coalition government’s taskforce on children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing in 2015 **\[d\]**, which drew attention to the finding that the long\-term cost was almost gbp10,000 for every single birth in the country. nhs england’s 2016 mental health strategy, *implementing the mental health forward view* **\[e\]**, modelled its new budget plans on the basis of this cpec work \(which showed “ *the gap between current specialist perinatal mental health provision in england and that required to meet nice guidelines in all areas*” \(p. 14\)\). the *nhs long term plan* \(2019\) subsequently cited the research to support 10\-year plans for developing better maternal mental health care **\[f\]**, after the research team was invited to discuss cpec findings with nhse staff \(2016\), as well as to carry out cost\-benefit analyses of recommended best practice for perinatal mental health, also commissioned by nhse. the economic impacts estimated in the cpec study were quoted by nhse and nice in *perinatal mental health care pathways* **\[g\]**. 

 **international policy** 

 the **maternal mental illness** study was replicated in the us, australia, and canada; discussed with government officials in australia and belgium; cited in the french national mental health strategy 2018\-23 **\[h\]**; recently used \(without even adjusting to the french context\) by the alliance francophone pour la santé mentale périnatale **\[i\]** to argue the case for urgent policy action; and translated into spanish by the alianza por la salud mental perinatal y de la familia, conecta perinatal. 

 cpec research on **promotion of mental health and prevention of mental disorders,** first for the department of health in 2011 and 2014, and subsequently for phe in 2017, continues to be used across the uk \(see below\) and internationally. knapp was invited to meet senior officials \(secretary\-level\) in six australian government departments to discuss the **public mental health** findings \(2016\). subsequently, knapp and mcdaid advised the australian national mental health commission as they explored the economic case for investment in mental health \(2017\-19\), and also supported a team at deakin university as they adapted the lse models to the australian context. knapp discussed findings with australia’s productivity commission \(2019\), as acknowledged in their report, in which a number of cpec studies are cited **\[j\]**. 

 the research has influenced debates on mental health policy at a number of supranational organisations. findings were cited by the world health organization at the global ministerial mental health summit \(2018\) **\[k\]**. mcdaid was invited to join a high\-level workshop with the eu health commissioner and his cabinet to discuss prevention \(2016\). mcdaid was also invited by the finnish government, as part of their eu presidency, to give a keynote presentation to the high\-level public health working committee of the european council on mental health and wellbeing \(2019\), and to speak at their eu presidency event on the economy of wellbeing \(2019\). 

 the case for investment in youth mental health by mcdaid, evans\-lacko, and park for the world economic forum \(wef\) **\[7\]** was used as a companion piece to the global framework for youth mental health report produced for wef \(may 2020\) **\[l\]**, and led to mcdaid being invited by unicef to contribute to *the state of the world’s children report* *2020*. the wef work and cpec’s earlier work for phe **\[4\]** together supported activities in brazil, led to service\-planning discussions by evans\-lacko and mcdaid with the state secretary of education in alagoas and the secretary of health from mato grosso do sul, and detailed discussions about service planning and investment with local professionals in maceio. 

 **local impacts** 

 research for the department of health in 2011 on **promotion of mental health and prevention of mental disorders**, analysing the scale and distribution of costs and pay\-offs of 15 very different interventions **\[5\]**, and later analyses of recovery\-focused support for people experiencing psychoses **\[6\]**, continue to have applications across the uk. these analyses have informed the 2016 nhs england mental health strategy, specifically its budgeting for enhanced early intervention psychosis services **\[e\]**. the programme of work is cited in the 2019 *nhs long term plan* **\[f\]**, which emphasises early intervention services, improved physical health care, employment support, suicide prevention, and perinatal mental health services – all of which were analysed in these cpec studies. 

 the work influenced local commissioning strategies. it was used by phe to develop mental health and wellbeing joint strategic needs assessments \(jsnas\) by local authorities and nhs clinical commissioning groups, and also to help develop their recommended approaches to improving children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing **\[m\]**. many local authorities and clinical commissioning groups have used the findings to prompt local recommendations and actions; an example is warwickshire’s public mental health and wellbeing strategy **\[n\]**. the research was also cited by nhs scotland in their *good mental health for all* policy document **\[o\]**. 

 follow\-up work was published in 2017 and endorsed by phe: “ *local authorities, clinical commissioning groups, health and wellbeing boards and their local partners \(for example schools, employers, police\) can use this set of resources to improve the provision of mental health services*” **\[p\]**. the toolkit is one of the resources in the government’s *prevention concordat for better mental health* **\[p\]** and is cited in local strategy and policy documents **\[q\]**. 

 the **preventonomics** tools are being utilised by the five sites \(blackpool, bradford, lambeth, nottingham, southend\) involved in the *better start* initiative. the *cost calculator* is available publicly and is increasingly adopted by third\-sector organisations \(such as nspcc, national children’s bureau, bradford trident, and uk active\). impact on services and support continues, but the initiative is already demonstrating local impact, with tools and resources embedded into local systems to enable local authorities to link information on service costs with impacts on children and young people to inform decisions on service provision **\[r\]**. 

 research for nice on the effectiveness of interventions to promote the mental wellbeing and independence of older people fed into nice guidance **\[s\]**, with all of the detailed evidence statements developed by mcdaid and park. 

 cpec work on the economic case for tackling **loneliness** led to requests for mcdaid to attend meetings at the cabinet office, to join an expert group with the chief scientific adviser, and to advise the office for national statistics on measurement of loneliness, as well as widespread media coverage \(bbc, *the independent*, *the* *guardian,* *time magazine, el mundo*\). publication of final findings has been delayed by covid\-19 **\[t\]**. earlier work on the economic benefits for mental health from alleviating loneliness \(produced as part of **\[5\]**\) was cited in the final report of the jo cox commission on loneliness **\[u\]**. the evidence review for nice led by mcdaid and park was key to nice guidance that recommended tailored group\-based social activities to address loneliness **\[s\]**. 

 **in conclusion** 

 overall, cpec research has made significant contributions to efforts to prevent mental health problems, and to improve the lives of individuals who experience them, at local, national, and international levels.

 **1. summary of the impact** 

 connelly’s research on the first world war \(fww\) and his commitment to engaging the public with his research, made a demonstrable contribution to the uk’s nationwide fww centenary commemorations. collaborations with the department for digital, culture, media and sport, the heritage lottery fund, the commonwealth war graves commission, the church of england, and the uk’s national battlefield schools programme promoted greater understanding, awareness and interest in the significance and relevance of the conflict. connelly’s work throughout the centenary increased participation and engagement in community and voluntary activities; improved knowledge sharing and educational opportunities for young people; promoted public reflection on the causes and consequences of the fww and enhanced the visitor experience and contributed to the preservation of fww cultural, archival and architectural heritage in ypres. 
","
 **2. underpinning research** 

 connelly’s research has focussed on the military, social and cultural aspects of the fww and how these were experienced by frontline units, people on the home front, veterans and the bereaved. a key feature of his work has been understanding the aftermath and legacy of war. the research was conducted between 2000 and 2019, in a range of national and international archives, and drew upon an extensive range of primary and secondary sources. 

 building on this extensive research expertise, connelly gained over £1m from the ahrc for projects aimed at using research expertise to enrich public understandings of the fww, and engagement with the centenary. these projects allowed connelly to reflect on the nature of contemporary commemoration and memory processes, and ways of reaching out to a wide range of audiences. these findings have fed into his recent research \(see especially **r6**\). 

 the key research findings and arguments, which underpin this case study, are that: 

-  the commemoration of the conflict is extremely complex, and culturally and time\-specific. what is commemorated and remembered today is often very different from the immediate post\-war period: both in terms of themes and sites of memory **\[r1, r3, r5\-r6\]**. 

-  commemoration was, and is, used to create a sense of community and identity, which makes it a useful tool for nation states and grassroots organisations and bodies **\[r1\-r2, r4\-r6\]**. 

-  study of battlefields as memory sites is crucial to understanding the remembrance culture of the conflict **\[r6\]**. this also informs connelly’s current research on reconstruction, memorialisation and battlefield tourism. 

-  remembrance and commemoration in the post\-war period were as much bottom\-up practices as top\-down **\[r1\-r6\]**. 

-  study of commemoration should not only look at sites of memory, but also how they fit into the wider physical landscape, their inter\-relationships, and, crucially, how people access, move across and between memory sites. the navigation around and between the sites and across the landscapes is as important as the sites themselves **\[r1, r6\]**. 

-  cultures of memory existed in two very different registers. the ‘higher’ register of moral duty to remember and commemorate leading to spiritual enhancement, and the ‘lower’ one of commercialism which made the war something that could be consumed, particularly as part of a pleasure culture **\[r1, r5\-r6\]**. 

-  britain and the empire often commemorated the war as a highly necessary endeavour which, although intensely bloody, was justifiable and should be remembered with pride **\[r1\-r5\]**. 

-  ‘revisionist’ understandings of british military performance have been overstretched and need to be contextualised more closely against the roles played by both allies and enemies **\[r2\-r3\]**. 

-  the war needs to be understood as a multi\-media event which was presented to people in a complex manner **\[r1, r4\-r6\]**.

 **4. details of the impact** 

 **promoting remembrance and reflection on the contribution of the fww generation to the modern world** 

 the department for digital, culture, media & sport \(dcms\) drew extensively on connelly’s research expertise to ‘shape our commemorative activity’ **\[a\]** of the centenaries of the battle of the somme \(held in manchester on friday 1<sup>st</sup> july 2016\), and the third battle of ypres \(passchendaele\) \(held at zonnebeke in belgium between 29<sup>th</sup> july and 1<sup>st</sup> august 2017\). 

 for the somme centenary, connelly extensively briefed the dcms team and its partner organisations on the significance and historical context of the battle; identified central themes for exploration; advised on available archival resources; briefed the parliamentary all party war heritage group on outreach activities; and assembled a team from the ahrc gateways to the fww centre to support the commemorations. connelly also provided a historical account for the commemorative service booklet and worked closely with the church of england’s liturgical committee to develop the westminster abbey service marking the centenary of the outbreak of first world war \(4<sup>th</sup> august 2014\) and the manchester cathedral service marking the centenary of the battle of the somme \(1<sup>st</sup> july 2016\) **\[a\]**. more than 19,000 ticket holders attended the manchester commemorations, and both cathedral services were broadcast live by the bbc. 

 for the passchendaele centenary, connelly worked closely with the dcms team to broaden the appeal of the commemorations by looking beyond the battle itself and incorporating the impact of the fighting on local people in belgium and on the way the battle was commemorated in its immediate aftermath. as part of this, gateways \(led by connelly\) provided a series of presentations in the main arena \(experience field\) and a dramatisation co\-written by connelly with dr helen brooks, was performed ten times on the main stage during the commemorations. the passchendaele memorial museum estimated that 39,000 visitors attended over the three\-day period. the dcms evaluation of the centenary reported that this combination of traditional commemorative events integrated with the innovative use of arts and culture in the first world war commemorations \(fwwc\) was particularly effective in promoting engagement **\[h, i\]**. 

 the dcms’ somme centenary project director noted that ‘gateways to the first world war proved to be an invaluable resource. we couldn't have done it without them.’ **\[a\]**. similarly, the director of culture, tourism and sport at dcms \(responsible for delivering the passchendaele centenary\) noted gateways’ ‘outstanding contribution to the national commemoration’ which provided guests with a ‘rewarding and unforgettable experience’ **\[b\]**. yougov tracked public knowledge and attitudes towards the fwwc over the course of the commemorations and found that the fww programme had a considerable impact in raising awareness and understanding of the fww and also helped people to commemorate the sacrifices that were made **\[h\]**. according to the bbc’s audience research, almost half those who engaged or experienced any of the fwwc content learnt something new **\[h\]**. 

 **preserving fww cultural and architectural heritage in ypres: improving access and understanding of records and archives, enhancing the visitor experience and sustaining a legacy for future generations,** 

 connelly used his expertise on the significance of the west flanders city of ieper/ypres in a number of ways. firstly, he briefed representatives of the british media and travel businesses on the importance of the third battle of ypres as part of the regional government’s tourism and heritage office campaign to encourage tourism. building on this, in 2017 he launched an initiative which further improved the visitor experience and led to greater public engagement. in collaboration with st george’s memorial church, built as a memorial to the british and commonwealth forces who fought and died around the city, connelly designed new walking tours of the city’s main remembrance sites and trained university of kent students to act as guides. by drawing parallels between the modern visitor and the first wave of visitors, the new tours showed tourists that they were also part of a rich heritage of battlefield pilgrimages to the ypres salient. the vice\-chair of the st george’s memorial church’s friends stated that ‘this was a unique project in the history of st. george’s … started from scratch by mark \[connelly\]’ and resulted in ‘extremely positive’ visitor feedback **\[c\]**. 

 the success of this innovative scheme led to its adoption by the commonwealth war graves commission \(cwgc\) supported by uk government funding. connelly collaborated with the cwgc to embed the tours into its new intern scheme by leading training sessions for the interns and providing them with the historical and geographical knowledge needed to lead the tours as well as to interpret the main sites of the ypres battlefields where they were based. the cwgc’s chief historian stated of these sessions: ‘the feedback has been incredible – you were an absolute hit\! **’**. he went on to describe how connelly’s ‘expertise and hands\-on support \[…\] formed the basis of the bespoke training programme for our guides’ and how the scheme which this training underpinned ‘has proved a pioneering project which has contributed to a significant cultural shift within the organisation’ **\[d\]**. it has reached hundreds of visitors and similar tours elsewhere are being considered **\[d\]**.  this scheme featured as a case study in the centenary programme evaluation conducted by dcms. the evaluation describes the internship scheme as ‘a tangible legacy of the fwwc for the cwgc, since the scheme is still ongoing and will continue in the future’ **\[h\]**. 

 drawing on his extensive experience of the cwgc records, and working in partnership with cwgc’s archives team, connelly also helped improve knowledge of its collections for both staff and visitors, encouraging interaction and exploration. he created two projects for volunteers to explore archival holdings and understand cataloguing processes and held a series of public events in the uk and belgium to highlight the nature of the archival holdings. this contributed to the increase in visitors to its website and an increased engagement with its social media platforms. **\[h, i\]** in 2018, connelly was called upon to act as an expert witness for the cwcg’s successful application for unesco world heritage listing for its casualty database, which is used by approximately 32 million visitors annually **\[d\]**. the cwgc’s chief historian stated that connelly’s ‘collaboration and work with us has… had a real and tangible benefit to the commission and to the wider public … interested in the history and work of our organisation, and added that , ‘connelly’s research has had a substantial influence on the development of our public engagement and outreach programme ….no other historian’s research has had a greater impact on knowledge and understanding within the cwgc over the period of the fww centenary than that of professor connelly’ **\[d\]**. 

 **enhancing understanding of the impact and legacies of fww by engaging young people with innovative programmes and accessible educational resources** 

 the schools battlefield tours programme was a £6.3 million award\-winning programme central to the national centenary commemorations. it provided the opportunity for students and a teacher from every state\-funded secondary school in england to visit the western front battlefields and to develop associated projects within their school and local community. connelly, a member of the advisory board, informed and shaped the programme; checked and advised on materials; and also shared ‘his extensive knowledge of the battlefields…\[and\] contributed significantly to the programme’s student tour booklet … to ensure this became a first\-class publication’. the booklet has since ‘been used by more than 8,000 students and teachers’ **\[e\]**. the scheme engaged with more than two\-thirds \(2,350\) of all english secondary schools between 2014 and 2020. teachers reported that almost all \(99%\) of their pupils developed a deeper and broader understanding of the fww.  the british future participant surveys suggest that there were lasting effects in terms of remembrance and awareness. illustrating the longer\-term impact on the teaching of history in secondary schools, 92% of teachers reported they would review their approach to teaching the fww as a result of their participation in the programme **\[h\]**. 

 through gateways, connelly further strengthened the capacity of schools to teach the fww, by designing and managing a programme of study in 22 schools in kent and neighbouring counties \(of which 95% of the schools were non\-selective\). this programme directly engaged nearly 1,600 students, with 55% of the students coming from areas of high socio\-economic deprivation. the project encouraged schools to explore key humanities skills through the prism of the fww. this was achieved through a series of special sessions focusing on history, literature and the visual arts. on completion of the project, 92% of students reported an increased interest in, and knowledge of, the conflict, while 75% stated an enhanced interest in the humanities more generally **\[f\]**. 

 **increasing capacity for voluntary groups to participate and engage in community activities** 

 gateways to the first world war centre, led by connelly, encouraged and supported public interest in the centenary, enabling communities across britain to explore and share their fww heritage. two major aspects of gateways’ work were to provide guidance and support for community groups developing applications to the national heritage lottery fund \(nhlf\); and to provide training, networking, and showcasing opportunities for projects which were awarded funding. gateways directly assisted 73 nhlf applications from groups in 53 separate uk parliamentary constituencies \(the furthest being in the outer hebrides\). in total these groups gained over £2.3million in funding **\[f\]**. ten groups went on to make follow\-on applications having gained experience and confidence by working with gateways. through gateways, connelly directly increased the capacity of both individuals and organisations to engage with the fww and the heritage in their communities. 

 using his research knowledge and the network he had built up over many years connelly recruited a diverse team of collaborators to deliver the project. the diversity of expertise and interests in this team was central to connelly’s aim of developing a public engagement methodology which encouraged different perspectives and interpretations of the fww and which promoted effective collaboration between the academic world and the wider community.  gateways hosted over 150 training days and archive visits and supported 79 open days in partnership with the nhlf **\[f\]**. by working with collaborators gateways enabled a wide variety of historical topics to be explored by an equally wide range of groups. topics researched included: international experiences \(particularly those of the british empire\); studies of women and children; people with disabilities; industrial and workplace experiences; and the fighting services. the findings were then expressed in an equally diverse range of innovative outputs including exhibitions, performances, films, websites, databases, apps, and booklets. 

 demonstrating gateway’s educational impact, a survey for the national lottery heritage fund in 2018, found that 99% of respondents reported that engagement with the ahrc fww centres had improved their knowledge of the fww and 80% reported that the projects had changed how people viewed the fww’s impacts on the local community **\[h, i\]**. feedback from gateways’ collaborators reveals how the projects enhanced knowledge and research skills while also having positive effects on social wellbeing and inclusivity: a recently retired man who had found the adjustment difficult stated, ‘it revitalised \[me\]… i felt really buoyed up by it’ **\[g\]** while community groups described how ‘\[participation\] has helped us and local residents to… reduce social isolation – \[it has\] brought people of all ages together,’ another project leader reported that ‘our volunteers have grown in terms of skills learnt and also developed outcomes in terms of increased confidence and self\-esteem’ **\[f\]**; amongst participants in gateway’s projects, knowledge, self\-confidence and self\-esteem were improved while general transferrable skills were also developed and augmented.

##  1. summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 research undertaken by kate pickett at the university of york with richard wilkinson, has been pivotal in arguing that status hierarchies and relative income inequality strongly impact wider human health and wellbeing, not only at the bottom but at every rung of the social ladder. it has profoundly shaped policy debate and implementation at a range of national and supra\-national levels. <ins>firstly</ins>, it has influenced the scientific review of the 17 un sustainable development goals \(sdgs\) and 169 targets. <ins>secondly</ins>, it has directly shaped the european commission’s work on the european child guarantee. <ins>thirdly</ins>, it has informed the oecd’s work on inclusive growth, which led to the creation of the wellbeing, inclusion, sustainability and equal opportunity \(wise\) centre. <ins>fourthly</ins>, through work with the equality trust, 26 fairness commissions have been formed, leading to the successful living wage campaign, implemented across 26 uk councils \(16 of these reported within the current ref period\). 
","
##  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 the research, jointly conducted by professor kate pickett and honorary visiting professor richard wilkinson, includes 21 research articles and seven commentaries/editorials/invited pieces in peer\-reviewed journals, and has informed two particularly influential monographs –  ‘the spirit level’ published in 2009 \( **tsl**\), and the ‘the inner level’ **\[f\]** published in 2018 \( **til**\) – introducing the work to a wider audience via an innovative and accessible interdisciplinary account of how income inequality heightens the saliency of social class and status for health. building upon the popular success of tsl, til offered a more scholarly focus, including extensive original research using a range of indicators of \(in\)equality, social cohesion, life chances, and health. this progressed tsl’s analysis of how social inequality ‘gets into our minds’ through status anxiety with consequences for levels of mental illness, emotional disorders and other social problems \(such as bullying, gambling, and substance abuse\) **\[f\]**. 

 now published in ten non\-english editions, til has been extensively reviewed, discussed, and used by commentators, politicians and others in the international print media. it appeared in both the observer and the tablet ‘books of the year’ lists in 2018. the work has a distinct relevance at the current time, as jeffrey sachs notes in his project syndicate column: *“as kate pickett and richard wilkinson convincingly reported in two important books, ‘the spirit level’ and ‘the inner level’, higher inequality leads to worse overall health conditions, which significantly increases vulnerability to covid\-19 deaths. moreover, higher inequality leads to lower social cohesion, less social trust and more political polarization, all of which negatively affect governments’ ability and readiness to adopt strong control measures.”* sachs consequently appointed pickett to the vatican commission on the science and ethics of happiness and wellbeing \(2019\-2021\). this body of research is thus widely considered as a significant and pioneering contribution to current and future debates regarding the interrelatedness of health, economics and social inequality. 

 in synthesising their own and others' empirical research, wilkinson and pickett have generated an innovative theoretical psychosocial framework for understanding the pathways through which income inequality adversely affects individuals and society. in doing this, they have established a number of significant features that differentiate affluent societies: 

-  people in affluent societies with lower income inequality gaps between rich and poor \(such as japan\) are far less likely to suffer widespread health and related social problems than people in less equal societies with larger income inequality gaps \(such as the uk\). **\[c\]** 

-  more unequal societies have both a higher prevalence and a higher range of health and social problems, such as obesity, drug use, and imprisonment. **\[a\]\[c\]\[f\]** 

-  the population of a society as a whole is negatively affected by inequality, not just the poor. **\[e\]\[f\]** 

-  material income matters less than how people feel they stand in relation to others in the social hierarchy. relative inequality thus generates status anxiety, producing stress and problems of self\-esteem which are detrimental to physical and mental health. **\[b\]\[e\]** 

 building on these findings, pickett and wilkinson collaborated on research to develop a sustainable wellbeing index as an alternative measure to assess the progress of the un sustainable development goals. a co\-authored commentary, ‘time to leave gdp behind’ \( *nature* 505, 16<sup>th</sup> january 2014\), argued that the successor to gdp should involve novel metrics that allow for wider, more inclusive, measures of economic and social sustainability. this body of research thus provides an overall measure of sustainable wellbeing that can motivate and guide the process of global societal change. **\[d\]**

##  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 pickett and wilkinson have directly contributed to public understanding and debate through hundreds of conferences, keynotes and seminars, aimed at predominantly non\-academic audiences. as a result, the research has influenced policy and legislation nationally and internationally. 

1.  <ins> **influencing un policy and the 2030 sustainable development goals:**</ins> 

 in 2013, pickett and wilkinson were appointed as co\-leads for inequality on the international expert working group \(wg\) for the un\-sponsored new development paradigm **\[1a\]**. pickett subsequently led a successful campaign with save the children, alongside 90 influential experts, for the inclusion of ‘income inequality’ in the 2030 un sustainable development goals \(sdgs\) **\[1b\]**. the need for a measure of inequality gained significant traction, and was agreed by the un in 2015, with the 2015 un report ‘review of targets for the sustainable development goals: the science perspective’. the report specifically cites the wg’s proposal to replace gdp with a new set of metrics that “integrates current knowledge of how ecology, economics, psychology and sociology collectively contribute to establishing and measuring sustainable wellbeing” \( **\[1c\]**, p.9\). subsequently, wilkinson was chosen as one of two un\-appointed expert reviewers for sdg 10 targets \(reduce inequality within and among countries\) and tsl was cited in the un research institute for social development \(unrisd\) flagship 2016 report, ‘policy innovations for transformative change’ **\[1d\]**. thus wilkinson and pickett’s research has achieved international recognition for demonstrating the inseparable interdependence of socioeconomic inequality and health and wellbeing outcomes, and was a catalyst for the inclusion of income inequality \(and related targets and measures\) within the sdgs. this influence continues: 

-  in noting that tsl was *“an important citation in unep’s background briefing on pollution”*, the former un environment \(unep\) chief scientist confirms the ongoing value of til, noting that: “ *til* \[was used\] *as inspiration to shift our thinking in unep and who towards a better way of approaching the health impacts of social and environmental inequalities* *from looking at health and environment in separate silos, showing that this was quite the wrong course of action from a policy and implementation perspective… professor pickett’s research in this regard has been important in revising views on the need to include inequality in the delivery of the sustainable development goals.”* **\[1e\]** 

-  the undp’s 2019 human development report on inequality references tsl and til extensively **\[1f\]**. 

-  a 2019 report to the un’s general assembly of the human rights council cites til in acknowledging that *‘the psychosocial environment is increasingly recognized as just as important for health as the physical environment’* **\[1g\]**. 

-  wilkinson and pickett were exclusively commissioned to write a report for the un department of economic and social affairs \(undesa\). the report \(published 2020\) was used in preparing a secretary\-general’s report on the priority theme of the 59<sup>th</sup> session of the commission of social development \(csocd\) \(taking place feb 2021\) **\[1h\]**. since csocd is the key un body responsible for the implementation of the copenhagen declaration and program of action for social development **,** session outcomes are expected to be significant, and writing the report for the session typically anticipates a significant influence over procedural decisions. 

1.  <ins> **influencing eu policy**</ins> 

 pickett was appointed as a commissioner on the eu\-based independent commission for sustainable equality \(icse\). the icse co\-chair recounts that pickett *“was one of the most active and influential members of the commission…* \[she\] *provided research\-based evidence that growing inequalities have had deleterious effects on physical and mental health and well\-being...* \[her findings\] *were subsequently cited in our report....* \[from which 60\] *policy recommendations have been incorporated into the european commission’s policy agenda.”* crucially, it is noted that pickett and wilkinson’s work both: 

1.  *“informed the european commission’s agenda/work programme report –“communication and annex on a strong social europe for just transitions”. the commission is expected to propose a <ins>social economy action plan</ins> containing related measures in 2021 based on this earlier foundational work.* 

1.  *“provided strong evidence of the importance of equality for child wellbeing and the need for greater equality of outcome to drive equality of opportunity for children and young people. icse called for the eu to issue a <ins>european child guarantee</ins> to mitigate the damaging effects of poverty and inequality on children”* **\[2a\]** 

 it has been confirmed that *“the new european commission has announced a legislative proposal for 2021 to establish the european child guarantee”* **\[2a\]**, and in july 2020 the commission published the feasibility study for a child guarantee \(awaiting consultation results\) **\[2b\]**. 

 in 2017, pickett and wilkinson’s research also informed the eu committee on employment and social affairs ‘report on combating inequalities as a lever to boost job creation and growth’ recommending reviews of eu inequality by all member states and identification of shortcomings as a matter of urgency. commission members voted in favour **\[2c\]**. 

1.  <ins> **influencing the oecd’s analysis and narratives on inclusive growth, and international campaigns to end child poverty**</ins> 

 pickett and wilkinson’s work significantly influenced the 2011 oecd campaign for income distribution and poverty as social indicators **\[3a\]**. this continued to have impact within the current ref period, such as its extensive referencing within oxfam’s corresponding ‘even it up’ campaign, which highlights the ‘toxic’ nature of inequality **\[3b\]**. commenting on the ongoing value of the research, the acting director of the oecd centre for wellbeing, inclusion and equal opportunity states that: 

 *“kate’s work has richly informed the oecd’s analysis and narratives on inclusive growth... by drawing together the bigger picture of inequality,* \[pickett and wilkinson\] *have shown... inequality weakens our societies, destroys public trust and has a toll on everybody’s well\-being. these facts have been fundamental in helping the oecd build the case for governments to take serious action. similarly, kate and richard’s contributions to the beyond gdp movement have been instrumental in promoting and articulating a new vision of societal progress,* *one that is in line with sustainability and long\-term investment in well\-being… last november for world children’s day, kate spoke at the oecd about the challenges for youth mental health, highlighting the need to refocus towards an economy of well\-being with children at the centre.*” **\[3c\]** 

 it is also verified that pickett’s “ *research and concrete policy insights continue to inform the research activities of the newly established wellbeing, inclusion, sustainability and equal opportunity \(wise\) centre’* **\[3c\]**. officially launched in november 2020, the mission of this oecd centre is to better understand the impact of polices and business actions on people’s lives. it has prepared resources such as <ins>www.compareyourincome.org</ins> to collect ‘new data and information on people’s perceptions of income inequality, to help align public spending to the priorities of all’. 

1.  <ins> **uk policy impact via the equality trust, fairness commissions and the new economics foundation, and the concept of a wellbeing economy used internationally**</ins> 

 wilkinson and pickett established the equality trust \(tet\) in 2009 to ‘raise awareness around issues of equality raised in \[tsl\]’ **\[4a\]**. by 2014, the tet had facilitated the set\-up of 26 uk fairness commissions \(fcs\) \(16 reporting during the current ref period\). the 2014 report, ‘approaches to reducing poverty and inequality in the uk:a study of civil society initiatives and fairness commissions’, commissioned by the webb memorial trust for the all parliamentary group on poverty explains that: ‘ *if we consider three of the main initiatives highlighted in this report … they have all to a greater or lesser degree been driven or inspired by organisations independent of government… in the case of fairness commissions, the work of the equality trust and inspiration of the book, ‘the spirit level’* **\[4a\]** *.* as testament to this influence, in 2020 pickett was appointed by andy burnham, elected mayor of greater manchester, to chair the greater manchester independent inequalities commission. 

 wilkinson and pickett’s central role was confirmed by the new economics foundation \(nef\) who reported in 2015 that: *“inspired by the evidence in \[tsl\] ... local authorities and their partners have set up fairness commissions and similar participative bodies to reduce inequality and poverty”* **\[4b\]**. all 26 fcs have supported the implementation of a living wage and pay ratios, including oldham fairness commission, who, in 2019, successfully lobbied for living wage implementation by oldham council and directly cited til as an influence for their campaign **\[4c\]\[4d\]**. this campaign complemented the impact of the wider uk living wage campaign \(led by nef and strongly influenced by pickett’s work, which is referred to in **\[4b\]**\), whose impacts include: 

-  *""in the last year \(since living wage week 2014\) 29,011 workers across the uk have had a pay rise as a result of employers becoming accredited. this includes both directly employed and subcontracted staff members.""* **\[4e\]** 

-  “*york council introduced the living wage \(becoming accredited in november 2013\), benefiting 573 employees, 75% of whom were women. it extended this to casual workers in 2014 thereby covering a further 120 staff.”* **\[4f\]** 

-  since 2016, tet has been uk and european convener of the global fight inequality alliance and co\-secretariat for the all parliamentary group on poverty. 

-  both tsl and til have been cited extensively within uk parliamentary debate during the current ref period. **\[4g\]** 

 the former director of the new economics foundation \(nef\) confirms that they *“saw first\-hand the influence ‘the spirit level’ had on government policy making... i was able to use the evidence from their research to show that while the irish transfer system was beneficial in mitigating the harms caused by inequality, how much better both societal and economic outcomes would be if these inequalities were prevented from occurring in the first place.”* now chair of the wellbeing economy alliance, he acknowledges that *“both books had a major influence on our foundational work on defining and promoting the concept of a wellbeing economy and this has influenced the policies of the countries we have been working with. both new zealand wellbeing budgets... have put a major emphasis on the prevention of inequality and tackling mental health issues”* **\[4h**\]. prime minister arden endorsed this when introducing the first new zealand wellbeing budget in may 2019, ”we have broadened our definition of success for our country to one that incorporates not just the health of our finances, but also of our natural resources, people and communities” \[ **4i**\]. this included nzd1.9 billion \(gbp980 million\) for mental health support, nzd320 million for measures to combat family violence, and more than nzd1 billion for child wellbeing. these measures were taken forward in the subsequent 2020 budget, delivered within the context of covid\-19.

 the research of melhuish, siraj, sylva and sammons has shaped early years policy, provision, practice and research for two decades in the uk and beyond. two major longitudinal studies demonstrated the long\-term benefits of early education, identified effective pedagogy, and shed light on the power of the home learning environment. the research provided the evidence to underpin uk government initiatives such as the provision of free early childhood education to millions of 2\-4 year olds, encouraging and supporting home learning, and professional development interventions based on quality scales developed by the researchers. internationally, governments and early education providers in australia, norway, japan, and hong kong have used the tools and findings from the research to improve the early education provision of tens of thousands of children.

###  2. underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 key staff from the university of oxford’s department of education have been leaders of the effective preschool, primary and secondary education study \(eppse 1997\-2016, known as eppe until 2007\) since its inception. eppse, and the follow\-up study of early education and development \(seed 2012\-present\), on which professor melhuish is the academic lead, demonstrate the long\-term impact of early childhood education \(ece\) and the early home learning environment \(hle\) on educational and social development. four strands of findings have led to impact: 

 **strand a \-** effectiveness of ece in improving children’s outcomes, age 2\-4.* 

 the innovative longitudinal eppse study was the largest in europe, following the developmental trajectories of more than 3,000 children in england, to investigate the effects of different types of ece on children’s outcomes at school entry **\(r1\)** and follow up across different phases to the end of schooling **\(r3, r5\)**. eppse showed that children who attended preschool education made a stronger start to school, that they continued to make accelerated progress throughout primary education, and that they showed academic advantage \(compared to children without ece\) at the end of compulsory schooling along with social\-behavioural benefits. it also revealed advantages of starting at age two. 

 **strand b –** home learning environment \(hle\) influences on children’s development* 

 through interviews with over 3000 parents, eppse identified daily activities in the home that best supported later progress. eppse devised a new measure of the ‘early years hle’ that measured specific strategies that predicted subsequent progress in school according to baseline measures **\(r4\)**. hle scores were more accurate predictors of children’s progress than standard socio\-economic status \(ses\) or income measures and had additional effects when ses and income controlled and long term hle effects on outcomes were identified **\(r5\)**. 

 **strand c \-** effects of ece quality on children’s developmental outcomes \(short and long term\)* 

 eppse demonstrated that high\-quality provision of ece, including intentional teaching and planned support for social\-emotional development, had lasting effects on children’s outcomes up to the end of compulsory schooling and that those effects had measurable financial returns **\(r3\)**. subsequent research also showed positive effects of high\-quality provision of ece on children’s outcomes in australia **\(r2\)** and that high\-quality ece produced better outcomes for disadvantaged children **\(r5\)**. 

 **strand d \-** improving the ece workforce: the use of research tools as the evidence\-base for successful continuing professional development \(cpd\)* 

 further research indicates the oxford\-designed early childhood environment rating\-scale extension \(ecers e\) **\(r1\)** and sustained shared thinking and emotional well\-being \(sstew\) **\(r2, r6\)** scales have predictive validity for better outcomes. these are now being used across the uk and internationally in research studies and pre/schools to improve practice. using these research\-based observational tools, practitioners were able to identify effective practice in their own centres and thereby improve the quality of their teaching and children’s developmental outcomes **\(r2, r6\)**. these tools developed initially to measure quality in eppse \(ecers\-e\) and its follow\-up study seed \(sstew\) are used successfully as the core of programmes for cpd. 

 the eppe and eppse projects have between them received over gbp8,000,000 in funding from the department of education and its predecessors over the past 20 years, and additional funding has been provided by the sutton trust.

###  4. details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 the pathways to impact, which were embedded into the design of the underpinning research, occurred through the creation of evidence\-based training for practitioners centred on the research findings/methods, collaborative research with practitioners, participation in government policy working groups in all uk countries, and advice to governments in high\- and low\-income countries. 

###  early childhood education \(ece\) and free part\-time education for 2 year olds. 

 in september 2013 the department for education \(dfe\) launched a gbp534,000,000 funding programme to extend free part\-time early education places to 2\-year\-olds in disadvantaged families. this extended its 2004 initiative offering universal free part\-time education for every child over the age of three. the director of evidence at the early intervention foundation stated that eppse research ‘ *directly influenced the government’s introduction of the 2\-year\-old offer for disadvantaged families*’ **\(e1\)**. in particular, the dfe consultation paper regarding the proposed changes cited eppse findings that *‘high quality early education can have a profound impact on social mobility’,* and the seed study, stating that *‘given the lower starting point among disadvantaged children, and reduced likelihood to take up childcare, early education is particularly important for this group’* **\(e2\)**. a dfe review of the pilot noted that ** **‘**the detailed policy …was strongly influenced by research evidence’* including eppe **\(e3\)**. from 2014 this covered the 40% most disadvantaged families in the uk, over 400,000 children a year. in 2018, the then minister for children & families stated that since its introduction nearly 750,000 2\-year olds had benefited from the entitlement to 15 hours of free early education a week **\(e4\)**. as well as its direct influence on ece policy, the research has shaped research projects undertaken by the government\-funded early intervention foundation, thereby influencing local and national policy and practice through that body’s engagement with the dfe and the local government association **\(e1\)**. 

###  the home learning environment \(hle\) 

 the home learning environment is the physical home and the interactions in and around the home which implicitly and explicitly support a child’s learning **\(e5\)**. hle initiatives by government and charities have been based on eppse evidence **\(r4\)**. action for children, a charity aimed at helping vulnerable children, published a 2016 report highlighting the importance of the early home environment to improving life chances **\(e6\)**. as part of their *fair by five* campaign, this report called on government to make child development a national priority by 2020 and used eppse research to spearhead this campaign. the campaign was successful, in that the dfe allocated gbp13,500,000 to support hle in 2018, and the research findings have directly influenced the dfe’s focus on home learning **\(e7\)**. the secretary of state for education, quoted in parliament’s in\-house magazine, said that high\-quality early years education was ‘ *a core priority for his department*’, with specific emphasis on the home learning environment **\(e8\)**. consequently, the dfe funded the national children’s bureau, the national literacy trust, peebles, and the foundation years trust to deliver a range of projects to support the hle, particularly in disadvantaged areas of the uk. this consortium published guidance for schools, nurseries, local authorities and public health partners, **\(e9\)** which cited eppse and seed research and shared examples of best practice taken from areas of relative disadvantage in bradford, leicester, hastings and rother, the wirral peninsula, oxfordshire, bognor regis and knowsley. 

 in 2018, the dfe and the national literacy trust extensively cited eppse research when announcing the government’s behaviour change model to improve the hle. this new policy consisted of a range of programmes to enhance the life chances of children from disadvantaged backgrounds including a national three\-year *hungry little minds* campaign, based on the same research findings, which provides online tools for parents to enhance literary and language learning at home **\(e5\)**. 

 the social mobility commission similarly utilised eppse findings on the impact of the hle on children’s outcomes when recommending that government and local authorities *‘*\[drive\] *uptake of the early education offer for disadvantaged two\-year\-olds,’* to *‘*\[ensure\] *that all parenting support programmes are evidence based and* \[to experiment\] *with ways to offer effective advice to more parents’* **\(e10\).** eppse evidence directly led to the recommendation in a house of commons education committee report, ‘tackling disadvantage in the early years’ that the government *‘commission research on interventions that will support parents in providing a strong home learning environment for their children.’* the education committee report has been influential on the government’s wider early years social mobility programme, with the government’s response to the committee report referring to over gbp100,000,000 of investment in this area and also citing seed findings on the importance of the hle, stating *‘the evidence is clear…hle is the single biggest influence on a child’s vocabulary at age three’* **\(e11, p.6\)**. 

###  effects of quality on children’s development 

 eppse research **\(r3\)** has since extended to have an impact in policy development across europe. in 2014, the european commission published their ‘proposal for key principles of a quality framework for early childhood education and care’ that cites eppse publications multiple times. this document informed european\-wide strategy as part of horizon 2020 about the importance of ece in addressing child poverty and preventing early school leaving, which were two of the *‘headline targets of the eu2020 strategy’* **\(e12\)**. 

###  evidence\-based cpd 

 eppse and seed research findings have been disseminated around the world, and according to a professor of early childhood and family policy at columbia university, ‘ *eppse’s findings have transformed the global discussion on quality in young children’s learning experiences’* **\(e13d\)** *.* in particular, the use and development of two quality rating scales provides strong findings of the impact of evidence\-based high\-quality practice on child development **\(r1, r2, r3, r5\)**. the ecers\-e **\(r1\)** and sstew **\(r2, r6\)** scales are now being used extensively across the uk in research studies and pre/schools to improve practice, and the testimonials from australia, norway and japan are just a few examples of their impact on hundreds of pre\-schools and tens of thousands of children and staff internationally **\[e13\]**. 

 early education providers in many countries have adopted practices found effective in eppse/seed. in australia the largest provider of pre\-school education, goodstart early learning, has purchased 850 copies of eppse/seed’s quality rating scales to support quality practitioner practice as part of a *‘program of practice uplift’* for over 16,700 educators and 75,600 children across 660 centres **\(e13a\)**, and eppse’s findings *‘have led to the development of free high\-quality preschool for… all three\-year\-olds in victoria, australia.’* **\(e13d\)**. in norway, eppse *‘has inspired both research and practice’* including multiple research projects at the university of stavanger and the municipality of stavanger’s introduction of sstew training to 123 kindergartens, improving ece quality for over 7,000 children **\(e13b\)**. the university of tokyo has translated eppse research, including the sstew scale, for publication in japanese and *‘the essence and ideas’* of their cpd provision for over 6,000 ece practitioners across japan was *‘derived from sstew’* **\(e13c\)**. the university of hong kong has also made extensive use of the research and rating scales provided by eppse in shaping their ece research and *‘data\-informed policy’* recommendations across the asia\-pacific region, including the singapore kindergarden impact project and the free quality kindergarden education policy in hong kong **\(e13e\)**.

###  1. summary of the impact 

 exercise in extreme environments \(very cold or hot conditions\) impairs performance and can endanger athlete health and safety. research undertaken by the extreme environments group \(eeg\) at the university of portsmouth has: 

1.  underpinned international water\-safety regulations that protect athletes in over 200 countries across two sports; 

1.  changed sports event organisation and safety protocols for open water swimming competition; 

1.  improved sport science support practices and the preparation of team gb athletes competing in extreme environments, across ten olympic and paralympic sports and over two olympic cycles. 

 these impacts have increased the safety of many millions of recreational and elite athletes who compete in extreme environments worldwide, improved british athletes’ performances in extreme environments, and contributed to team gb’s olympic, paralympic and world championship successes. 
","
###  2. underpinning research 

 the eeg has an international reputation for fundamental and applied research examining the physiology, pathophysiology, psychology and psychophysiology of extreme terrestrial and aquatic environments, and the selection, preparation and protection of individuals operating in these environments. 

 \( **r1**\) and \( **r2**\) are from a collaboration between the eeg and the international olympic committee, international triathlon union \(itu\), and fédération internationale de natation \(fina\) \( **g1**, **g2**\). this began following the in\-competition death of elite open\-water swimmer fran crippens in 2010, which highlighted the need for evidence\-based water\-safety regulations to protect athlete\-health. our previous research, examining the thermophysiological responses to cold water, had shown that the ‘cold shock’ response can cause cardiac arrhythmias and that excessive cooling can result in hypothermia and swim failure. \( **r1**\) examined the thermophysiological responses of triathletes swimming for 20 minutes in a range of cool and cold\-water temperatures with, and without, wetsuits. this enabled identification of a lower safe water temperature limit, in terms of minimising ‘cold shock’ and preventing excessive neuromuscular and deep\-body cooling, with and without a wetsuit. \( **r2**\) extended this research to ‘marathon’ swimming of up to 2 hours, in standard swimming costumes across a range of water temperatures. the research demonstrated that ‘marathon’ swimmers could not maintain their deep\-body temperature in water of 18°c or less and did not accurately sense their thermal state, meaning that they could be unaware of becoming hypothermic. 

 \( **r3**\), \( **r4**\), \( **r5**\) and \( **r6**\) are representative examples of our research developing evidence\-based interventions for optimising athlete performance in hot conditions. this work was undertaken as part of a collaborative relationship between the eeg and uk sport / english institute of sport \(eis\) that commenced prior to the 2004 olympic games and has continued through the rio 2016 and tokyo 2021 olympic cycles \( **g3**, **g4**, **g5**\). \( **r3**\) and \( **r4**\) examined acute interventions for enhancing performance in the heat. \( **r3**\) built on our previous research developing cooling interventions for defence groups, comparing the heat\-extraction rates of a range of different cooling interventions, in athletes. this research demonstrated the effectiveness of two, easy to implement, interventions for cooling athletes following exercise in a hot environment \(whole body fanning and hand immersion in cool water\). \( **r4**\) investigated a new approach to manipulating thermal perception during exercise in the heat. menthol is a chemical compound that elicits feelings of coolness when applied to the skin. \( **r4**\) demonstrated that high concentrations of menthol made the participants feel cooler during exercise in the heat, but also initiated a heat\-storage response, which had the negative effect of increasing the athlete’s body temperature. however, a lower menthol concentration still provided some cooling sensation, whilst reducing the heat\-storage response. 

 \( **r5**\) and \( **r6**\) examined chronic interventions for enhancing performance in the heat and the variability between individuals in the response to this type of intervention. \( **r5**\) is from a series of heat acclimation studies examining the adaptation profile, time\-course of acquisition and decay, and performance effects of a number of novel approaches to heat acclimation, in well\-trained individuals. this included combined \(heat and hypoxia\) and augmented \(heat and dehydration\) stressor approaches. \( **r5**\) demonstrated that the normal thermophysiological adaptations occurring with heat acclimation were not adversely affected by sleeping in a hypoxic tent. this was important because elite athletes often use hypoxic stress \(e.g. altitude training or hypoxic tents\) to increase the blood’s oxygen\-carrying capacity and enhance their performance and it had been hypothesised that this could impair the adaptive responses to heat. \( **r6**\) examined the individual responses to heat acclimation among a group of trained males undergoing a standardised 10\-day heat acclimation programme. the study demonstrated substantial inter\-individual variability in the adaptive profile, which was independent of fitness\-level, as well as the independence between different indices of heat acclimation. based upon these findings, it was concluded that, in contrast to the traditional view, highly trained endurance athletes should not be considered partially heat\-adapted and that each athlete has their own, distinct, heat acclimated ‘profile’ which could be characterised and used to benchmark their ‘heat readiness’.

###  4. details of the impact 

 immersion in cold water can cause ‘cold\-shock’ \(a precursor to drowning and cardiac arrhythmias\), neuromuscular incapacitation, hypothermia, and, *in extremis*, death. however, athletes are frequently exposed to cold water during open water swimming and triathlon competition, with a 2012 usa triathlon fatality incidents study reporting that 79% of triathlon deaths occurred during the swimming leg of triathlon competition. \( **r1**\) directly underpinned **new water\-safety regulations introduced by the itu in november 2015**, mandating the use of protective clothing \(wetsuits\) and limiting the water temperature in which athletes can compete. these new regulations specify a minimum safe water temperature of 16°c without a wetsuit, 12°c with a wetsuit, and competition cancellation if water temperature is below 12°c \(itu competition rules 4.2 and 4.3; **s1**\). they apply to **all itu sanctioned triathlon competitions including olympic, paralympic, world championship, world series, and recreational competitions under itu regulations in 119 itu affiliated countries**; in the uk and usa alone there are \~4,200,000 triathlon competitors each year. the impact of these regulations in reducing the risk of harm to athletes is evidenced by itu medical committee chair, dr sergio migliorini, who states ‘… *after the introduction of the new rules we have had **less cases of swim failure and of mild/severe hypothermia**, and we have improved the safety of the swim leg*…’ \( **s2**\). 

 \( **r2**\) demonstrated that fina’s extant open water swimming rules, in which athletes were not permitted to wear a wetsuit, could result in ‘cold shock’ and hypothermia during competition. as a direct result of this research, from february 2016, **fina introduced a range of new polices to increase athlete safety** at open water swimming events. these fina policy changes included: i\) mandatory athlete cold water exposure preceding the start of the event to mitigate ‘cold shock’; ii\) a minimum of 60\-minutes post\-event athlete surveillance; iii\) hot baths and hot fluid ingestion for athlete rewarming; iv\) increased numbers of event lifeguards; v\) additional training for coaches, fina delegates and local organisation committee safety officers on cold\-water swimming risks \( **s3**\). 

 \( **r2**\) also directly underpinned **new water temperature\-limits and safety equipment rules introduced by fina from 1 january 2017.** these regulations permitted wetsuit use for the first time, being compulsory in water temperatures less than 18°c and optional in water temperatures less than 20°c, and mandated that open water swimming competitions could not take place in water temperatures less than 16°c \(fina by\-laws 8.4 and 8.5; **s4**\). these regulations apply to **all competitions held under fina rules, including the olympic games, word championships, world series and grand prix circuit events, as well as competitions under fina regulations in 209 member countries**. the importance of this work is evidenced by fina bureau member dr margo mountjoy who states that \( **r2**\) has ‘ *helped to safeguard the health and safety of open water swimmers around the world, and has been a successful risk mitigation strategy for fina*’ \( **s5**\). 

 in addition to improving athlete safety and protection, our research has also positively impacted on the performance of athletes competing in cold water. \( **r2**\) underpinned our applied work supporting team gb open water swimmers for the rio 2016 olympic games, resulting in the **addition of cold\-water acclimatisation sessions within athletes’ training and providing the athletes with the confidence that they would not become hypothermic during competition.** according to bernie dietzig \(marathon lead; british swimming\), this ‘… *made a significant impact to our performance at the 2016 olympic games in rio*’ \( **s6**\). \(r2\) also underpinned our work supporting un patron of the oceans, lewis pugh, in his preparations for ‘the long swim’ along the length of the english channel, **demonstrating that he was unlikely to become hypothermic and that, from a ‘thermophysiological perspective’, the challenge was achievable** \( **s7**\). the awareness raised by this record\-breaking 49\-day swim, culminated in uk government’s commitment to advocate for the protection of at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. 

 at the other end of the temperature spectrum, our research has also improved the safety and performance of olympic and paralympic athletes competing in hot conditions, through impacts on practitioner decision\-making, sport\-science support, and athlete training and preparation. this has been achieved through applied work with team gb athletes, and through strategic advisory roles with key stakeholder groups, including the eis, where our evidence\-based heat mitigation advice in the areas of heat acclimation, athlete cooling and perceptual manipulation is underpinned by \( **r3**\) to \( **r6**\), as well as our wider body of related research. the reach of this research within elite sport in the uk is evidenced by dr victoria downie \(performance innovation team; eis\), who has supported multiple sports across the rio 2016 and tokyo 2020 olympic cycles: ‘… *we look to their research group to provide expert opinion and feed into our applied work from the information coming out of their lab...* **the extreme environments group have been directly involved in informing the heat preparation strategies for hockey, triathlon, athletics, para archery and para equestrian**… the extreme environments lab has made considerable impact on our practice and underpinned the advice we give on preparing for performance in the heat…’* \( **s8**\). 

 the significance of our impact on elite sport performance in the heat is exemplified by our work supporting british triathlon’s preparations for the rio 2016 olympic games. despite taking place in the brazilian winter, the anticipated air temperature \(around 25°c\) was assessed as having the potential to impair performance. the eeg worked with practitioners from british triathlon and the eis to develop an evidence\-based strategy to mitigate the effects of heat on performance and support athlete health. \( **r3**\) to \( **r5**\), as well as our wider body of related research, guided practitioner decision\-making in the areas of heat acclimation/acclimatisation, hydration, cooling, and perceptual manipulation, evidencing appropriate interventions and highlighting ineffective, or potentially dangerous, practices. the resultant strategy contributed to team gb’s triathletes having their most successful olympics to date, despite hotter\-than\-anticipated temperatures \(up to 29°c\). this is supported by testimony from andrew shaw \(physiologist; british triathlon\), who states that the eeg ‘… *have been a fantastic asset to british triathlon when formulating our extreme environment strategy. **their expertise and guidance contributed towards a heat strategy that aided our athletes to deliver 3 medals at the rio olympic games**, in addition to multiple medals at a world level…* ’ \( **s9**\). 

 our research has continued to change practice and enhance performance within british triathlon into the tokyo olympiad, which is predicted to be the hottest olympic and paralympic games to date. \( **r6**\) directly underpinned **a new ‘heat\-readiness’ test that was introduced by british triathlon in 2018.** according to laura needham \(co\-head of physiology; eis and senior physiologist; british triathlon\): ‘ *this is a novel approach and one that enables us to assess the acclimation state or ‘heat readiness’ of triathletes at a given time and was **used in the preparation for our triathletes this summer for the tokyo test event and will be implemented next year for the olympic games**. the input of the extreme environments laboratory, drawing upon their research on assessment of heat acclimation state, was invaluable in developing this test’* \( **s10**\). this heat preparation strategy supported the british triathlon team to win 9 medals at the ‘tokyo test event’ in august 2019, for which british triathlon received the award for ‘support staff from any specialism who have made a special impact on high\-performance’ at the 2020 uk sport plx awards. 

 ‘heat\-readiness’ testing also enabled british triathlon to make evidence\-based comparisons of the effectiveness of a traditional warm weather training\-camp with laboratory\-based heat acclimation amongst their elite triathletes. this process demonstrated the superiority of laboratory heat acclimation and resulted in the **decision by british triathlon to include a laboratory heat acclimation programme as part of the olympic preparation camp; this is a mandatory element of the athlete preparation process for the tokyo olympic games**. importantly, this new approach has been well received by the athletes and has increased their confidence in the heat preparation strategy. moreover, the efficacy of this novel approach within british triathlon has led to **‘heat\-readiness’ testing now also being used by team gb cycling, para\-triathlon, sailing, hockey, athletics, and equestrian** to support the olympic and paralympic preparations of their athletes and para\-athletes \( **s10**\). 

 in summary, original research from the eeg has increased the safety and improved the performance of athletes competing in extreme conditions, at both ends of the temperature spectrum, and in terrestrial and aquatic environments. our research has had worldwide impact, in able\-bodied and para\-sport, and from recreational to elite level. it has changed the policies of national and international sports organisations, underpinned regulations applying to athletes in over 200 countries, and improved sports event safety. our research has positively impacted on elite athletes and their professional support staff across ten olympic sports, over two olympiads. it has guided practitioner decision making, changed sport science support, improved athlete training, underpinned olympic preparation policy, and enhanced performance. together, these impacts have increased the protection and duty of care for athletes competing in extreme environments and contributed to british medal successes at olympic, paralympic and world championship level.

###  1. summary of the impact 

 drowning is the third most common cause of accidental death worldwide, accounting for around 320,000 deaths annually \(world health organization, 2020\) and around 200 deaths during sport and leisure activities each year in the uk \(water incident database\). original research from the university of portsmouth \(uop\) underpins ‘respect the water’, a national water\-safety campaign that has increased awareness of the dangers of cold water, changed water\-safety behaviour and saved the lives of children and adults. our research underpins water\-safety training delivered to over 100,000 children across the uk, has been incorporated into the practice, policies and recommendations of national and international water\-safety organisations, and has changed uk legislation for lifejacket usage, preventing the deaths of fisherman. we have increased understanding of the causes of drowning\-related deaths, informed medical guidelines for treating immersion casualties and underpinned uk, us and international search and rescue guidelines that are used in 162 countries by 99% of the world’s merchant shipping. 
","
###  2. underpinning research 

 the outputs underpinning this case study were led by **professor michael tipton**, in conjunction with other members of the extreme environments group \(eeg\) at uop. these outputs represent a significant body of water\-safety research, founded on the city’s maritime and naval heritage, and undertaken with input from relevant stakeholders and collaborators. the research intersects at each stage of the drowning timeline, a model of the stages of the drowning process \( *am j emerg med*. 2016, 34\(11\): 2224\-2226\), developed by **tipton** in collaboration with the international drowning research alliance \(\[idra\]  [http://idra.world/](http://idra.world/)\). 

 \( **r1**, **r2** and **r3\)** are examples of our research examining the ‘cold shock’ response, a series of physiological responses evoked by immersion in cold water, characterised by an ‘inspiratory gasp’, hyperventilation, elevated heart rate, and peripheral vasoconstriction. these responses are temporarily debilitating and can be life threatening; they are implicated in sudden death on initial immersion and the observation that 40% of drownings occur within 2m of safety \(international lifesaving federation, 2010\). building on **tipton**’s earlier work on cold shock, the eeg undertook a series of studies investigating the role of anxiety and threat appraisal on cold shock \(for a summary see: *front psychol*. 2018, 11; 9: 510\). \( **r1**\), which is a representative example from this body of work, investigated the effect of elevated anxiety, induced through a deception manipulation, on the cold shock response in adults. the research demonstrated that, compared to a non\-deception control, anxiety increased the magnitude of the cold shock response upon cold water immersion. \( **r2**\), conducted in collaboration with colleagues from king’s college london, demonstrated that the simultaneous activation of parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic inputs to the heart, which may occur during cold\-water submersion, increased arrhythmias in an animal model with long qt syndrome \(a heritable condition linked to sudden cardiac death\). this supported our ‘autonomic conflict’ hypothesis for explaining sudden death during cold\-water immersion *\(j physiol*. 2012, 15; 590\(14\): 3219\-3230\), and together with \( **r1**\), provided empirical evidence for safety strategies that minimise anxiety upon cold\-water immersion. \( **r3**\) examined the physiological responses of children undergoing cold\-water immersion, providing the first published evidence of the cold shock response in children. this indicated that safety behaviours to mitigate cold shock would be relevant for children, as well as adults. 

 given the debilitating effects of cold shock, the actions taken before and during the initial minutes of immersion are critical in determining survival. \( **r4**\), funded by the royal society for the prevention of accidents \( **g1**\), investigated the buoyancy of different clothing assemblies upon immersion in water, when floating and swimming. in a series of laboratory and field trials with adults, adolescents and children, it was demonstrated that clothing layers significantly improved buoyancy and airway freeboard \(mouth to water distance\) on immersion. this supported our recommendation that the primary survival behaviour for adults and children upon accidental immersion should be to ‘float first’, until the cold shock response is reduced. \( **r5**\), funded by royal national lifeboat institution \(rnli; **g2**, **g3**\), examined the effect of a crotch\-strap retention system on lifejacket performance; reference to lifejackets ‘riding up’ over the torso and head was evident in a number of fatal accident reports. lifejacket performance was assessed following a vertical water entry and in 3\-hour exposures to waves using a custom\-built ‘drowning manikin’, to estimate the time taken to inhale the lethal seawater dose. compared to a no crotch\-strap condition, airway freeboard was greater with a crotch\-strap and the time taken to aspirate the lethal dose of seawater for drowning doubled, indicating improved airway protection. 

 once an individual becomes immersed in water, rescuers must be able to accurately estimate survival time to coordinate rescue efforts and, subsequently, to review the incident to prevent future occurrence. \( **r6**\), undertaken in collaboration with the maritime and coastguard agency, details a retrospective analysis of fatal maritime incident data collected between 2007 and 2016. the research identified that 180 lives \(47% of all cases\) could have been saved if a lifejacket had been worn and provided empirical support for the use of lifejackets. \( **r7**\), funded by the us coast guard \( **g4**\), used data from the uk national immersion incident survey to model survival capability for immersion victims. this is the largest database of its kind and includes information about the physical attributes of the immersion victim, environmental conditions, duration of immersion, and survival. from these data, the most significant factors determining cold\-water immersion survivability were identified and a mathematical model was produced to predict survival time in cold water.

###  4. details of the impact 

 ‘respect the water’ is a nationwide, multimedia, water\-safety campaign launched in 2014 by the rnli with the aim of reducing drowning deaths in the uk and ireland. throughout this campaign, **tipton** has acted as scientific advisor to the rnli and been a member of the rnli council and medical committee. he has appeared in campaign material, given radio and television interviews in support of the campaign, and undertaken a 24hr ask me anything on cold\-water survival on the online platform reddit \(19/12/2017\); a substantial amount of campaign footage was filmed in the uop’s extreme environments laboratory. **the initial campaign theme ‘treat the water with respect, not everyone can be saved’ was underpinned by our research on cold shock** \( **r1\-3**, **s1**\). between 2014 and 2016, the campaign discouraged cold water entry by highlighting the physiological incapacitation and negative physiological consequences of the cold shock response \( **r1\-3**\), the risks arising from reduced breath\-hold time \( **r1, r3**\), and the effect of anxiety on this response \( **r1**, **r2**\). however, recognising that just under 50% of those who enter cold water do so unintentionally, the campaign message shifted in 2017 to mitigate the impact of cold shock, instructing people to ‘fight your instincts’, relax and ‘float to live’ until breathing is back under conscious control \( **s1**\). **this safety advice was directly underpinned by our research demonstrating the buoyancy provided by trapped air between clothing layers,** and advocated floating \(‘float first’\) as the primary survival behaviour upon accidental water immersion \( **r4**\). the direct link between our research and the water safety advice underpinning this campaign is typified by the information on the campaign website \( [https://www.respectthewater.com/](https://www.respectthewater.com/)\). this includes a video presented by **tipton** describing cold shock and how to overcome this \(‘how to survive cold water shock’\), a ‘floating facts’ section, referencing our research \( **r4**\) and including floating instructions, a 3d interactive graphic, and a video on how to float if immersed \( **s1**\). 

 the reach of ‘respect the water’ has been substantial. in the first month of the 2017 campaign, 5,700,000 males \(a target demographic accounting for more than 90% of coastal drownings\) were reached through social\-media. in 2018, 535 items of print and broadcast media reached 46,000,000 people \( **s2**\), 266,000 people visited the campaign website and **more than 50% of  young men in the uk were aware of ‘respect the water’** \( **s2**\). the ‘float to live’ youtube video \( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jncvb2onyc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jncvb2onyc4)\), underpinned by our work, has received over 13,000,000 views, with a ‘cold shock’ video featuring tipton viewed over 79,000 times \( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trriuh7cp78](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trriuh7cp78)\). the significance of ‘respect the water’ has been pronounced, resulting in increased awareness and understanding of water safety, behavioural changes, and saved lives. rnli data following the 2018 campaign demonstrated that the proportion of young men in the uk taking precautions near the water rose from 77% to 87%, with a significant increase in the number saying that they would ‘float first’ if accidentally immersed. across the 2017 to 2019 campaigns, **22 individuals contacted the rnli to say that the ‘float to live’ technique saved their life** \( **s2**\). this is exemplified by testimony provided by an individual who used ‘float to live’ advice in a survival situation: ‘ *i panicked for a few seconds and that’s when i remembered the radio commercial that told me to float instead of fighting the water. i just lay back and started floating and kicking my legs… it saved my life*.’ \( **s3**\).  more recently \(july 2020\), the impact of our work was evidenced in the statements of an rnli coxswain after recusing a 10 year old boy who was found floating with arms and legs spread, half a mile from shore ‘… *he’d been watching lifeboat rescues on ‘saving lives at sea’* \(bbc television programme\) *and followed the* *advice given on the show* … *had he not, the outcome might have been very different*’ \( **s3**\). 

 according to the uk water incident database, approximately 40 young people drown in the uk every year. the ‘swim safe’ programme, delivered by swim england and the rnli, has run annually between may and september since 2013. this programme teaches children aged 7\-14 how to be safe in, and around, open water. it has now **been delivered to over 100,000 children** and includes information on ‘cold shock’ \( **r3**\), advocates ‘float first’ as a primary safety behaviour and provides practical floating tuition \( **r4**\). an independent evaluation indicates that this **has been effective at improving children’s water safety knowledge**. for example, before ‘swim safe’, only 38% knew that the cold water makes it difficult to breathe normally; this rose to 69% after the programme \( **s4**\). the rnli have also produced a range of free educational resources \( [https://rnli.org/youth\-education/education\-resources](https://rnli.org/youth-education/education-resources)\) for delivery in schools, including lesson plans, posters, and videos on ‘cold shock’ and ‘float to live’, tailored for key stages 1\-4. these were all reviewed and approved by **tipton**. at a local level, in 2019, **tipton**, in partnership with hampshire county council and the rnli, developed ‘stay afloat’, a free, downloadable, water safety education resource pack underpinned by our water\-safety research \( **r1\-4**\) for key stage 3 and 4 children across hampshire \( [https://www.hants.gov.uk/educationandlearning/stayafloat](https://www.hants.gov.uk/educationandlearning/stayafloat)\). this has been delivered in hampshire schools, with our own research on more than 1,000 children demonstrating significantly increased awareness of the dangers of cold\-water shock and the appropriate behaviours to take if immersed, which was retained 3\-6 months later. 

 our research \( **r4**\) also underpins the **royal life saving society’s water safety code** \( **s5**\) and has been incorporated into the **royal society for the prevention of accidents guidance for managing safety at inland waters** \( **r1\-4**, **s6**\). ‘float first’ is now recommended by the **uk coastguard** to 999 callers for maritime in\-water incidents, and internationally, by the **alaska office of boating safety**, a us government department. our body of water safety research has also been utilised in the 2015 **european resuscitation council guidelines for resuscitation,** the 2016 **wilderness medical society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of drowning,** and the **international liaison committee on resuscitation’s 2015 advisory statement on guidelines for reporting of data of drowning related resuscitation.** a 2019 podcast \(drowning: roadside to rescue\) produced by ‘the resus room’, a medical education site focusing on patient care in and around the resuscitation room, was based on our water safety research and listened to by more than 17,000 people within the first 5 months.

 **1. summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 improving the effectiveness of training is an important challenge for high performance and safety critical industries. wilson and vine’s research on the assessment and training of gaze behaviour is transforming professional practice in a range of these industries, by significantly enhancing participants’ performance and reducing training costs for providers. this impact was achieved in the following ways: the research has been commercialised by a spin\-out company, cineon training limited, and developed into award\-winning immersive learning products for the oil \(e.g., \[text removed for publication\], pharmaceutical \[text removed for publication\] and healthcare \(nhs\)/royal college of surgeons\) sectors. the research has also been embedded within mandatory training curricula for \[text removed for publication\] military forces and surgical registrars and contributed to medal\-winning performance for an olympic sport \[text removed for publication\]. as such, wilson and vine’s influence on training has rippled out from the narrow confines of sport to other domains where there are important socio\-economic and health\-related benefits.

 **2. underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 picking up the right visual information at the right time is critical to making accurate decisions or movements, especially when the demand for precision is high, and skills must be performed under pressure. expert practitioners in a range of fields demonstrate optimal information pick\-up, sometimes known as the ‘quiet eye’, to coordinate perception, decision\-making and action. however, experts are unable to accurately verbalise the cognitive processes by which they perfect the quiet\-eye, hindering access to their implicit knowledge. traditional training, involving learning through experience, can therefore be time\-consuming and sometimes ineffective. since 2008, wilson and vine’s research has objectively measured the attentional processes of experts during the performance of real\-world skills, via mobile eye\-tracking, and developed and tested alternative approaches in which this information is provided to learners via videos, verbal cues, or virtual reality simulations. by combining these insights with developments in psychological theory, the researchers have sought to accelerate and improve the training process by developing and applying novel forms of quiet\-eye training \(qet\). 

 in 2010, wilson and vine published the very first studies showing that qet could be applied to novices, accelerating the acquisition of golf\-putting **\[3.1\]** and basketball\-shooting **\[3.2\]** skills. these skills also proved more robust when under pressure, compared with those acquired via typical coaching instructions focused on movement control. subsequent research, funded by an economic and social research council \(esrc\) business voucher, demonstrated that even experts could enhance their own performance with qet: low\-handicap golfers putted better under pressure in laboratory tests and improved their on\-course competitive performance \(\~2 putts fewer per round\) compared to a control group **. \[3.3\]** 

 these early positive findings and subsequent mechanistic studies **\[e.g. 3.4\]**, created a launchpad for further practical work in other real\-world settings beyond sport. for instance, a 2009 esrc grant provided the opportunity to apply this novel approach to laparoscopic surgical skill\-learning. again, following initial research that sought to understand the visuomotor processes underpinning skilled performance in these tasks, a randomised control trial revealed the advantage of qet: trainee surgeons were significantly quicker in completing a virtual\-reality surgical task under demanding multi\-tasking conditions, compared with trainees receiving standard training instructions **\[3.5\].** this study \- and the funded impact work that followed it \- formed the initial evidence base for the inclusion of qet in the mandatory training curriculum for urology surgeons in the uk **\[5.6\]**. 

 based on the success of qet in sport and in surgery, the exeter researchers were funded by the ministry of defence \(via the defence science and technology laboratory, dstl\) to conduct an initial proof\-of\-concept study examining small\-arms maritime marksmanship **\[3.6\]**. this research identified benefits of qet, with the qet group displaying more effective gaze control and more accurate shooting performance than the control group. further grants \(2015 and 2016\) provided the evidence base for the adoption of qet to improve current procedures for élite specialist users who are required to learn a range of difficult visuomotor skills, before performing these under life\-or\-death pressure **\[5.8, 5.9\].** this research also ‘closed the circle’, in that it helped develop the expertise in how qet could aid shooting under psychological and physiological pressure that supported the impact in sport, \[text removed for publication\] **\[5.10\].**

 **4. details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 many sectors, from competitive sport to healthcare and the military, continually seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness with which participants are trained. for complex skills, where visual information needs to be processed to guide precise decisions or movements \(e.g., performing delicate surgery or accurate marksmanship\), picking up the right visual information at the right time is critical. acquiring this optimal information pick\-up, or the ‘quiet eye’, is thus a goal of many training programmes. but, although proficient at the quiet eye, experts are unable to verbalise precisely how they gain this proficiency. therefore, training typically requires learners to improve their performance through personal experience \(i.e., learning from mistakes\), a time\-consuming and sometimes ineffective approach, particularly when the taught skills must then be performed under stressful conditions. 

 wilson and vine’s research into the assessment and training of gaze behaviour, or quiet\-eye training \(qet\), has generated an entirely novel approach to training that accelerates the learning process: trainees are provided with information obtained from eye\-tracking to attain the quiet eye, enabling them to leapfrog traditional, experience\-based stages of learning. furthermore, qet produces better performance under pressure. first developed in sport, exeter’s widely applicable research insights are now beneficially impacting training in many other high\-performance and safety\-critical domains, significantly enhancing participants’ performance. the research has also directly led to the establishment of a commercial company delivering qet to more than a thousand staff across oil, pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. 

 further details of the significance and reach of exeter’s impact are now outlined. 

 <ins> **creating a new start\-up company with benefits for safety training for the oil, pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.**</ins> 

 wilson and vine’s research insights underpin the formation and commercial viability of uk start\-up cineon training \( [www.cineon.training](http://www.cineon.training/)\). launched in 2016 as a collaboration between the university of exeter and cineon productions, and supported by an esrc impact acceleration award, the company provides training for safety critical industries using virtual\-reality \(vr\) simulation tools, and offers solutions co\-developed with wilson and vine’s research team. 

 **significance:** \[text removed for publication\] **\[5.1\].** the unique selling point of its vr tools is the incorporation of gaze behaviour assessment and training insights directly informed by exeter’s research. 

 **reach:** the company is developing training for major customers in several different safety\-critical industries. the impact of the exeter research thus reaches thousands of employees internationally, and is transforming training philosophy, policy and practice across diverse sectors: 

-  **oil:** concawe \(a division of the european petroleum refiners association, representing 40 of the world’s largest oil companies\) approached cineon training to develop training for improving safety on oil refineries in europe via virtual\-reality qet **\[5.2\]**. the training improves hazard awareness skills in operators, reducing accidents and was ranked in the top ten vr experiences of 2019 **\[5.3\]**. to date, the training has been adopted by \[text removed for publication\], reaching an estimated 500 trainees by the end of 2020 **\[5.1\]**. 

-  **pharmaceuticals:** a vr qet tool developed by cineon training for a major pharmaceutical company, \[text removed for publication\], has been permanently adopted at its portugal facility which produces 14.6 million vials of medicine per year, each requiring inspection by a trained operator. to date, 65 existing and newly recruited inspectors have received training across two separate phases **\[5.4\]**. 

-  **healthcare**: training to support the safe use of personal protective equipment was developed by cineon, vine & wilson for nhs staff during the covid\-19 pandemic, reaching \~500 trainees via an online platform in april 2020 alone, after which it became open access to all health and social care organisations in the u.k. **\[5.5\].** 

 <ins> **improving effectiveness</ins> <ins>and efficiency</ins> <ins>of urology surgery training**</ins> 

 urology was the first branch of surgery to use endoscopic and key\-hole techniques and is often a trend\-setter for minimally\-invasive techniques. the ‘urology bootcamp’, an innovative and practical training course which won an education award at the zenith global health awards 2019, is the uk’s <ins>first</ins> mandatory training programme for qualified surgeons in any discipline. the course director wanted to shorten the time needed for trainees to reach proficiency on fundamental technical surgical skills, and thus improve the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the training camp. following a presentation of exeter’s research to the royal college of surgeons’ commission on the “future of surgery” \(2018\) \- he invited the exeter researchers to develop gaze\-based training videos for the course **\[5.6\].** since 2019, trainees now watch the videos – hosted directly on the bootcamp online environment \- ahead of course attendance, to assist in the pre\-learning of these key skills, and can access the videos during the module to consolidate their learning. 

 **significance:** as a direct result of exeter’s work, trainees from the bootcamp reported ‘ *being more aware of controlling gaze to control movements*’, ‘ *increased feelings of confidence*’ and the value of ongoing “practising using the video as a guide”. **\[5.6\]<sup>**</sup> 

 **reach:** due to the significant benefits offered by exeter research, the director has ‘ *fully integrated these concepts into our technical skills training module, taken by **all** urologist trainees in the uk’.* **\[5.6\]** this impact on training now benefits all 50 to 60 uk urologists who complete the bootcamp annually, with plans to apply the same training approach to urologists in belgium, portugal, and turkey, as well as to other surgical disciplines in the uk, which are expected to follow urology’s innovative approach **\[5.6\].** 

 <ins> **enhancing</ins> <ins>training infrastructure</ins> <ins>for</ins><ins>**</ins> <ins>\[text removed for publication\]</ins> <ins> **military</ins> <ins>training</ins><ins>**</ins> 

 since 2012, the exeter researchers have been commissioned by the defence science and technology laboratory \(dstl\) to develop novel training approaches; a partnership that has been highlighted as a successful case study of ‘supporting our world\-leading defence’ in the government’s 2020 uk r&d roadmap \(p16\) **\[5.7\]**. much of this work has focused on an element of counter\-terrorism training for \[text removed for publication\], which was hitherto identified as particularly challenging for the ministry of defence \(mod\). 

 **significance:** \[text removed for publication\] the benefits of the bespoke qet resources were summarised by the manager of dstl’s ‘maximising human performance \(mhp\)’ project, after their first adoption in 2017: ‘ *trainees provided with the gaze training instructions showed a greater increase in their accuracy of execution of the tasks over the course, compared to trainees from a previous cohort who received the standard training. additionally, both senior officers in charge of managing training, and instructors delivering training were positive about its benefits to them. … the videos simplified initial verbal teaching of the principles of the task, meaning that … more time was available for practice in the training arena.”* **\[5.8\]** the ongoing significance of exeter’s contribution to the success of this training programme is revealed in a 2019 impact bulletin published for military audiences by dstl, which states that, ‘ *the novel training technique enhances … traditional methods of technical training enabling accelerated skill acquisition … facilitating a winning\-edge capability and reduced training costs*’ **\[5.9\]**. 

 **reach:** exeter’s impact has already been profound within the uk’s \[text removed for publication\] military regiment, in that **all** individuals going through selection since september 2017 now receive the new qet\-enhanced training programme for counter\-terrorism training. **\[5.8\]** additionally, *‘the videos are also being used on a one\-to\-one basis to assist students who may be struggling with learning the skills.’* **\[5.8\]**, revealing how the resources have been flexibly embedded within training procedures by the instructors themselves. 

 furthermore, the benefits of exeter’s research are being extended more generally to military capability via the dstl. in 2017, dstl noted that *“\[this work\] has benefitted our aims … to provide the mod, and our partners, with cutting\-edge research to support their human capability. the success of these interventions … has impacted significantly upon the strategic planning of dstl, with future research* *plans considering the extension and exploitation of this work to other tasks and cohorts’* **\[5.8\].** this exploitation has since begun, with the 2019 dstl impact bulletin reporting that dstl’s collaboration with the exeter researchers: *“has also generated interest with international partners \(via nato and ttcp\), which allows them and the uk to benefit as they exploit this research in alternative contexts.”* **\[5.9\].**
