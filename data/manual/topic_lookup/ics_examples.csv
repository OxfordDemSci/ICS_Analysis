Their research informed the implementation of healthcare and practical advice for organisers, coaches, and athletes. For example, the International Triathlon Union changed their regulations concerning wetsuit use in 2019 to account for added strain when wearing a wetsuit in high water temperatures. "
0,9,Anti-Match Fixing: Improving Global Sports Governance and Bringing Perpetrators to Account. ,https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/impact/13baa0be-f7c0-4808-83ae-f50e0f22e07f?page=1,"Previously, physical evidence was required to prosecute match fixing cases. ICS research helped have this requirement removed, allowing the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to rule that evidence from betting markets was sufficient to identify match fixing. Following this ruling, FIFA ordered the replay of a match in which the referee was found to be involved in match-fixing. This was the replay that enabled Senegal to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. ICS research has also underpinned the education of athletes and coaches on match-fixing. A follow-up project, ERASMUS+, saw Liverpool partner with EU Athletes to introduce whistle-blowing apps for 3,000 athletes in 7 countries across a range of sports."

Parrish’s work on nationality discrimination in sport has helped alter the EU’s approach to this issue whilst setting the boundaries for sports bodies on questions of nationality-based eligibility rules. Related commissions created change of nationality-based eligibility regulations of 26 Olympic sports across all 27 Member States of the EU, identifying that the widespread sporting practice of denying access to sporting competitions on account of nationality was in conflict with EU law regarding non-discrimination of nationality in economic matters. Judgements informed by this research protect athletes from discriminatory nationality measures adopted by both states and private bodies, such as sporting entities, under EU citizenship rights regardless of the level of economic activity (e.g., if the athlete is an amateur). Research underpinned an enquiry into nationality in European team sport launched by the European Commission in 2012, which challenged the legality of UEFA’s home-grown player rule (introduced in 2006/7). This challenge argued that the rule created indirect discrimination on the grounds of nationality."

These changes led humanitarian agencies to pay attention to ‘forgotten crises’, leading to action that would otherwise not have been offered. Most notable is the TNH’s reporting on the ‘overlooked’ March 2018 Yazidi healthcare crisis in Iraq. This reporting resulted in immediate action from the UN migration agency and Doctors Without Borders, among others. By the end of 2018, the main hospital serving the Yazidi minority had been moved to a safer and better-equipped facility and acquired new ambulances. TNH doubled their citation of ‘local experts’ in coverage between 2015-2017 and increased the proportion of ‘investigative’ or ‘campaigning’ journalism in their outputs. This helped humanitarian professionals develop policies that address the most urgent challenges in remote crises. For example, a 2018 TNH investigation into alleged chronic corruption in the UN’s resettlement process in Sudan caused the UN’s refugee agency to suspend resettlement operations there subject to further review. TNH’s reformed reporting has impacted the aid sector at an institutional level. For example, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and others have used TNH as a source when lobbying the UN Human Rights Council for an inquiry into abuse against the Rohingya. "

Hafeda’s work with Roma communities in Portugal inspired new community-led mediations to improve community relations. Hafeda’s work has inspired artists and curators working with marginalised communities elsewhere. For example, social artworks commissioned in marginalised communities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and for refugee children in Lebanon on the Syrian border. The projects have helped develop social and creative skills among 696 children, young people, and adults, empowering them to assert their rights and opinions by contributing to permanent social infrastructures.

These materials can be accessed for free online, and the education site was accessed 23,874 times as of July 2020. The educational resources, particularly those describing Alevism, were vital supporting evidence in the community’s 2015 application to be officially recognised as a religious charity, denoting state-recognition of the religion. Researchers designed the first comparative survey that would provide empirical data about the community, map Alevi settlement in the UK, and describe the community and their transnational connections. Data collected in this survey has allowed an estimate of the size of the UK Alevi community, and ‘Alevi’ was included in the 2021 national census as a distinct religious group. This research has done much to redress the exclusion felt by Alevis from communities and institutions in the UK. "

Researchers transformed the reporting of road traffic accidents via the development and evaluation of a mobile app reporting system used by police officers at the incident scene. The new reporting practices provided to police forces in November 2018, are already in use by 24 of the 45 police forces in England, Wales, and Scotland. These measures improved the reliability of collision data, and reduced police costs associated with the incident reporting and data processing that informs the Department for Transport and Transport Scotland's road safety policies."
