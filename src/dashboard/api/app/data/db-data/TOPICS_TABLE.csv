0,9,Health,Sport & Health,"The ICS in this topic focus on provisions for creating sporting environments and opportunities which are safe from any abuse or discrimination and promote the potentials for sport to support wider social and political change. They also support competitive performance and coaching approaches to facilitate it, as well as underpinning initiatives to improve the health and wellbeing of members of the general public and athletes alike","<h6>Advancing regulatory frameworks within Para sport: Ensuring sport is practised in a manner that respects fair play and protects the health of athletes globally.</h6>
<p>Members of the PHC at Loughborough University engaged in strategic, high profile capacity building in parasport. This resulted in the establishment of new sports at the Paralympics and Commonwealth Games, including Paracanoe at the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics and Wheelchair Basketball at the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Their research informed the implementation of healthcare and practical advice for organisers, coaches, and athletes. For example, the International Triathlon Union changed their regulations concerning wetsuit use in 2019 to account for added strain when wearing a wetsuit in high water temperatures.

<h6>Anti-Match Fixing: Improving Global Sports Governance and Bringing Perpetrators to Account. </h6>
<p>Previously, physical evidence was required to prosecute match fixing cases. ICS research helped have this requirement removed, allowing the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to rule that evidence from betting markets was sufficient to identify match fixing. Following this ruling, FIFA ordered the replay of a match in which the referee was found to be involved in match-fixing. This was the replay that enabled Senegal to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. ICS research has also underpinned the education of athletes and coaches on match-fixing. A follow-up project, ERASMUS+, saw Liverpool partner with EU Athletes to introduce whistle-blowing apps for 3,000 athletes in 7 countries across a range of sports.

<h6>Changing masculinities and enhancing safety in sport. </h6>
<p>Collaboration to establish LGBT+ Research in Sport Network with Sport England. Textbooks by ICS researchers have been adopted in UK universities. Oxford Brookes, Wolverhampton, Durham, and Southampton Solent now feature teaching on inclusive masculinities on sport-related and gender/sexuality-related courses. Anderson was one of the founders of the Sport Collision Injury Collective (SCIS), a multidisciplinary collective of academics highlighting injuries sustained in youth sport participation. The group published an open letter ‘Preventing injuries in children playing school rugby’ which petitioned to make contact sports non-compulsory. The SCIS website has received 900,000,000 hits, and the letter itself was printed in major print and online newspapers (e.g., The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Independent). New regulations regarding tackling in children’s rugby and banning heading in football for children under 12 have resulted.

<h6>Defining the autonomy and specificity of sport in EU law: Shaping the adoption of globally applicable football agent regulations and the EU’s approach to nationality-based eligibility rules in European sport.</h6>
<p>Most impact resulted from informing various EU commissions on regulating sports discrimination. Parrish’s work on nationality discrimination in sport has helped alter the EU’s approach to this issue whilst setting the boundaries for sports bodies on questions of nationality-based eligibility rules. Related commissions created change of nationality-based eligibility regulations of 26 Olympic sports across all 27 Member States of the EU, identifying that the widespread sporting practice of denying access to sporting competitions on account of nationality was in conflict with EU law regarding non-discrimination of nationality in economic matters. Judgements informed by this research protect athletes from discriminatory nationality measures adopted by both states and private bodies, such as sporting entities, under EU citizenship rights regardless of the level of economic activity (e.g., if the athlete is an amateur). Research underpinned an enquiry into nationality in European team sport launched by the European Commission in 2012, which challenged the legality of UEFA’s home-grown player rule (introduced in 2006/7). This challenge argued that the rule created indirect discrimination on the grounds of nationality.

<h6>Enhancing practice and improving outcomes of career transition support services in elite sport</h6>
<p>Introduction of mental health and practice support for professional athletes transitioning into non-sporting roles at the end of their competitive careers. This work has increased issue awareness in professional organisations and led to constructive outcomes. The England Rugby Players Association has introduced 8 development managers and 1 transition manager to support over 800 current and 400 former players across premiership clubs. These reforms became particularly significant during the Covid-19 pandemic, when team sports were heavily impacted and early career transition became necessary. This research prompted campaigns by the English Institute of Sport (#More2Me) and the International Federation of Professional Footballers Associations (FIFPro) to use the finding to encourage athletes to recognise the benefits of planning for life after sport. #More2Me was publicly backed by both the Minister for Sport and the Chair of UK Sport. Third sector organisations, such as the UK-based charity Switch the Play Foundation, have improved sport career transition outcomes based on this research.

<h6>Football4Peace (F4P): Building bridges in divided, unequal and unjust societies</h6>
<p>University of Brighton research led to the creation of Football4Peace (F4P) which uses values-based coaching methodology and delivery to promote peace-building in divided and post-conflict societies. Early work in Northern Ireland, Israel and South Africa has been extended in The Gambia, Colombia and South Korea. Related NGOs have been formed to support and further this programme and its methodologies, including the formation of UNESCO clubs based on the Brighton F4P initiatives. The model has been applied to several other sports, and since 2014 has benefitted 532 coaches/volunteers, 4,699 young people, residents and pupils in 87 local communities in 7 major cities. F4P training in Columbia in partnership with Fundación Buen Punto enabled FBP to obtain international recognition through an award given by Peace and Sport in Rhodes, 2018.

2,4,Economy,Business & Entrepreneurialism,"In this topic we find research that supports and informs business, entrepreneurialism, management and policies aimed at improving productivity and firm growth in various forms. Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies and financial opportunities that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient or better managed: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research. Several projects are also concerned with sustainable practices in business and entrepreneurialism for a greener economy.","<h6>Accelerating the Multi-Unit Leader and Service Chain Growth</h6>

<h6>Healthy Universities: A Whole System Approach to Improving Health, Wellbeing and Sustainability in Higher Education</h6>
<p>Using the ‘healthy settings’ approach, involving a holistic and multi-disciplinary method that integrates action across risk factors, the researchers created a Healthy Universities Model trialled by University of Central Lancaster. The healthy universities model has since been adopted by 86 UK HEIs, informed the publication of a Charter for Health Promoting Universities, and the establishment of an International Steering Group chaired by Dooris (an ICS researcher). The International Steering Group has overseen the adoption of the Healthy Universities Model by over 400 universities across 35 countries. This research has also influenced implementations of similar health support models. For example, the University of Sydney introduced Self-Review Tool that facilitated identification of priority areas for action by its 70,000 students and 7,500 staff, and the University of British Columbia pioneered Canadian Action for Healthy Universities, a model informed by this research to prioritise ‘health in all policies’.

<h6>An Early Start to Foreign Language Learning and Literacy</h6>
<p>Early foreign language (FL) learning in schools is a global education phenomenon but many countries report problems with learner progression and motivation. These problems are due in part to curricula uninformed by empirical evidence, a lack of age-appropriate resources, and a lack of teacher expertise and pedagogic confidence. FL learning research undertaken at the University of Southampton by Professor Ros Mitchell and Dr Alison Porter has: (A) Informed policy and addressed national implementation challenges. Mitchell’s research informed the rationale and attainment targets of the new FL requirement in the Primary National Curriculum in England, introduced in September 2014. Porter and Mitchell have since engaged with education stakeholders to ensure its sustainability and effective implementation. (B) Improved classroom practice and school provision: Since 2017, Porter and Mitchell have worked with teachers locally, nationally and globally, successfully encouraging research-informed primary FL pedagogy in participant schools. (C) Co-created original FL resources: The teacher-researcher partnerships have led to the co-construction of innovative FL literacy resources inspired by Porter’s research findings.

<p>This research contributed to the recognition of several mosques by Historic England, protecting them for future generations, and integrating the architectural contribution of British Muslims into the narrative of British culture and heritage. The announcement of this Grade Listed status resulted in over 30 press articles around the world. A Ramadan Pavilion designed by Shahed Saleem was the headline installation for the V&A’s London Festival of Architecture 2021 which focused on mosque architecture. Prior to this collaboration, the history of the mosque in Britain was not represented in the V&A’s collections or programming. The Muslim Council of Britain has credited this research and its outcomes with consolidating a place for British Muslims in the history of the nation and with providing a sense of legitimacy and belonging in public discourse.

<h6>Redefining Islamophobia and Influencing anti-Muslim hate crime policy in Britain</h6>
<p>Professor Awan’s work with Tell MAMA was directly used by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Islamophobia to address the threat of online Islamophobia, and Awan has informed various other committees. This research informed social media guidelines and current policy and legal guidance in relation to racial and religiously aggravated hate crime. Awan provided training for practitioners to implement case management, recording, and reporting. The training enabled Tell MAMA to find hard-to-reach groups and support them to report Islamophobia online. These tools have been accessed by 100 mosques across the UK. Further training for Faith Associates has resulted in changes in policies and strategies, that has enabled over 200 mosques and imams to have a greater understanding of how to effectively report Islamophobia. Research contributed to the Government’s National Hate Crime Action by presenting arguments for further funding to secure buildings from attacks. The Home Office allocated £1.6 million over 3 years for the protection of faith institutions. Awan has been commissioned by the government to establish a new working definition for Islamophobia which is now officially adopted by over 800 organisations.

<h6>Breaking the impasse on global reparations for Afrikan enslavement</h6>
<p>Based on this research, the International Network of Scholars, and Activists for Afrikan Reparations (INOSAAR) has broken an impasse between activists and academics over reparations for transatlantic trafficking of enslaved peoples. INOSAAR has built trust between stakeholders in Europe, the Americas, and the Afrikan continent, and is the only group to have members of civil society and grassroots academia on the platform. It has developed a global community of over 30 member organisations committed to the shared Principles of Participation. INOSAAR has brought about a global declaration, the Porto-Novo Declaration, calling for the active participation of Afrikan states in the reparations movement. In the UK, INOSAAR influenced the discussion of reparations policies in the UK, resulting in Bristol, Lambeth, and Islington Councils passing motions on Atonement and Reparations for the United Kingdom’s Transatlantic Traffic in Enslaved Africans.

<h6>Countdown to Annihilation: Shifting the global discourse on the genocide of the Rohingya</h6>
<p>The International State Crime Initiative’s (ISCI) research influenced offices of the UN which had initially resisted any ‘genocide determination’ to recognise the persecution of the Rohingya as ‘genocide’. The researchers briefed and worked closely with the UN Fact Finding Missions (FFM) on Myanmar in 2018, and the ISCI report is cited in the FFM recommendation of ‘genocide’ recognition. The ISCI advised The Gambia’s legal team in The Gambia’s Genocide case against Myanmar before the International Court of Justice. NGOs, such as the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK, have testified that the ISCI’s work in supporting the recognition of ‘genocide’ status has empowered them to speak out on behalf of the effected minority groups to raise awareness. The ICSI worked with global media to encourage the use of the terminology of ‘genocide’ in reporting on atrocities against the Rohingya. They briefed journalists and organisations, leading to widespread change to terminology by media organisations including CNN, Nikkei Asian Review, LA Times, and TIME. Sky News Television, who won a BAFTA Award for their Rohingya coverage, cited the fundamental importance of the ISCI research input.

<p>This research on internet policy-making processes has led Professor Franklin to lead the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition (IRPC). Since 2014, the IRPC has contributed to official recognition that there is a fundamental relationship between online information, communication technologies, and human rights. IRPC information has informed internet governance at the UN, in Europe, Cameroon, Brazil, Latin America, the Middle East, and North African regions. In 2014, the IRPC Charter was cited as a best practice document by the European Agency for Human Rights. In 2014, the Council of Europe published the Guide to Human Rights for Internet Users modelled on the IRPC Charter Booklet. The IRPC Charter continues to hold influence on public debates and government policies. In 2019, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Director of the World Wide Web consortium and founder of the World Wide Web Foundation, cited the IRPC Charter as a source in his Contract for the Web, a manifesto calling on governments, organisations, and individuals to ‘safeguard [the internet] from abuse and ensure it benefits humanity’. The Contract for the Web is backed by over 150 organisations.

It has had considerable impact on governmental policy around the world to safeguard democracy and access to trusted information, as well as supporting educators, media outlets, and individuals to navigate the digital information environment.","<h6>Humanitarian Journalism: Improving Crisis Reporting for More Effective Humanitarian Response</h6>
<p>The research contributed to a re-evaluation of The New Humanitarian (TNH), a key media news source for policymakers and the humanitarian aid sector. These changes led humanitarian agencies to pay attention to ‘forgotten crises’, leading to action that would otherwise not have been offered. Most notable is the TNH’s reporting on the ‘overlooked’ March 2018 Yazidi healthcare crisis in Iraq. This reporting resulted in immediate action from the UN migration agency and Doctors Without Borders, among others. By the end of 2018, the main hospital serving the Yazidi minority had been moved to a safer and better-equipped facility and acquired new ambulances. TNH doubled their citation of ‘local experts’ in coverage between 2015-2017 and increased the proportion of ‘investigative’ or ‘campaigning’ journalism in their outputs. This helped humanitarian professionals develop policies that address the most urgent challenges in remote crises. For example, a 2018 TNH investigation into alleged chronic corruption in the UN’s resettlement process in Sudan caused the UN’s refugee agency to suspend resettlement operations there subject to further review. TNH’s reformed reporting has impacted the aid sector at an institutional level. For example, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and others have used TNH as a source when lobbying the UN Human Rights Council for an inquiry into abuse against the Rohingya.

<p>Two major exhibitions hosted by the Jewish Museum in London, Blood: Unities & Dividing (2015/16) and Jews, Money, Myth (2019), influenced prominent collectors to open their collections and loan items to help change public understanding of Jewish history and cultural identity. Blood attracted over 11,000 people, sold over 600 exhibition books, and generated thousands of pounds in revenue. Its unprecedented acclaim created the demand for it to tour to the Galicia Jewish Museum, Krakow where it attracted more than 30,000 visitors, the most a tour exhibition has ever attracted to that musem. It then travelled to the POLIN Museum for History of Polish Jews, Warsaw, where it attracted 45,000, making it the most popular temporary exhibition the museum has ever hosted. It was covered in 628 media pieces, with an advertising value of around £1.1 million. Jews, Money, Myth reach 290 million people through media, and attracted 22,000 visitors. It won the Museums Association ‘Museums Change Lives’ award in 2019 for its impact on public understanding at a time of rising antisemitism.

At the time of ICS, the app has over 2,250 individual users, primarily in the UK but also in the USA, Malaysia and New Zealand. Interest in DREX increasing – it is now listed in the British and Irish Orthoptic Society's list of available rehabilitation options. DREX is also now being repurposed for other uses, such as clinical teaching in Malaysia.

<h6>Making music with brain signals to improve the quality of life of severely motor-impaired individuals </h6>
<p>Brain-Computer Music Interface (BCMI) technology allows a person or group of people suffering from severe motor impairment to create and perform music together, significantly benefitting their mental health and wellbeing. Paramusical Ensemble, a documentary of the preparation and performance of ‘Activating Memory’ by the initial trial group, won Best Documentary at the BioFiction Science Art Film Festival in 2019, and was screen across the globe, with 104,000 views on Vimeo alone in December 2020. The ICS produced a film for the series ‘Defiant Pioneers’, showcasing the work of Rosemary Johnson, a former violinist of the Welsh National Orchestra, paralysed in a car accident. The documentary was aired during the advert break of the season finale of Game of Thrones, attracting 12,100,000 viewers. Johnson received an MBE for her services to music using the BCMI technology.

<p>Research has shown that young people born in Central and Eastern Europe who have settled in the UK are disadvantaged in rights and opportunities, particularly in access to education and support services. Working with over 1,500 of these young people, this research developed a programme of training, policy, and community activities. Events and training materials highlighted youths' understanding of their experiences and barriers to participation in society, foregrounding discrimination and loss of rights after Brexit. This training has been accessed by over 5,000 individuals working in key services (education, social work, police, voluntary sector). The research informed social media campaigns, such as @MigrantYouth on Twitter (#heretostay #migrantyouth #migrantsrights), Instagram and Facebook. There has also been significant news coverage, such as the LSE Brexit Blog (overall monthly readership of 790,000) and Channel 4 News, where the story was viewed more than 50,000 times.

<h6>Countering the ‘Hostile Environment’ through Creative Practice: Making Space for the Stories of Immigration Detainees</h6>
<p>David Herd’s Refugee Tales, a project culminating in a three-volume collection of first-hand accounts of refugee experience, has been instrumental in changing public perception of refugee experience. Refugee Tales has informed changes to local and national policies to support these vulnerable communities, and has been used as a lobbying tool to press for legal change. For example, Refugee Tales included accounts of indefinite detention that influenced the framing of new detention policy. 28for28.org, which filmed readings of the published tales released on social media across 28 days, had such reach that extracts from Refugee Tales I and II was used as evidence in the Joint Committee on Human Rights’ Report on Immigration Detention. The Refugee Tales are taught in over 50 universities across the world, including Oxford, Cambridge, Cornell, Leiden, and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The Oak National Academy, which was funded by the Department of Education and was the main provider of home-school education during lockdown, dedicated a series of online lessons for KS3 students to the Refugee Tales books, with a reach of 4.7 million visitors to the online site.

<p>The Research and Identity project found that the Alevi community’s social invisibility negatively impacted their sense of belonging in school and in wider society. Researchers, working closely with Alevi groups elsewhere, such as the Alevi Federation in Turkey, developed educational resources and training to facilitate the teaching of Alevism in UK schools. These materials can be accessed for free online, and the education site was accessed 23,874 times as of July 2020. The educational resources, particularly those describing Alevism, were vital supporting evidence in the community’s 2015 application to be officially recognised as a religious charity, denoting state-recognition of the religion. Researchers designed the first comparative survey that would provide empirical data about the community, map Alevi settlement in the UK, and describe the community and their transnational connections. Data collected in this survey has allowed an estimate of the size of the UK Alevi community, and ‘Alevi’ was included in the 2021 national census as a distinct religious group. This research has done much to redress the exclusion felt by Alevis from communities and institutions in the UK.

<p>This research has created a global programme of language learning initiatives, ‘Language for Resilience’, supported by the British Council. These initiatives have been developed with partners across the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. The principles of this research are used to design and support language teaching programmes which employ trauma-sensitive methods of language learning to build resilience in refugee settings. This has changed how governments, major funding organisations (e.g., the British Council), and NGO’s (e.g., Mercy Corps) approach teaching practices in conflict and post-conflict settings. For example, Mercy Corps in Iraq drew on the pre-existing cultural practices of language teachers and multilingual pedagogies to delivery identity-affirming language programmes to Arabic-speaking displaced people from the south of Iraq, Kurdish-speaking refugees from Syria, and Kurdish-speaking host community students from Kurdistan. The British Council invited researchers to write a FutureLearn Massive Open Online Course: Migrants and Refugees in Education: A Toolkit for Teachers, that reached 7,411 learners in over 130 countries in its first two runs.

<h6>Improving Collection and Curatorial Practices at the National Museum of Ireland and Emphasising Social Value and Creativity in Older Irish Women</h6>
<p>Sorcha O’Brien’s research on the history of the electrification of rural Irish homes and its effects on women’s lives led to an exhibition, ‘Kitchen Power’, at the National Museum of Ireland (NMI). The exhibition prompted developments in museological practice, and a change in emphasis for NMI Country Life from folklife to social history to include the late 20th century, a gap in its coverage. This change in emphasis included the acquisition of 16 of the mass manufactured domestic appliances on display in the exhibition (out of 51 objects in the exhibition in total), adding to the 8 already in the NMI collection. It also prompted conceptual developments among the NMI curatorial staff, particularly the integration of oral histories as part of new permanent displays. The changes to curatorial and acquisition practices highlighted engrained issues of communication between departments and led to the creation of a Head of Operations position in NMI Country Life’s organisation. NMI visitor numbers increased significantly during the ‘Kitchen Power’ exhibition, rising from a previous 5-year average of 13,532 in July and 15,560 in August, to 15,060 in July and 18,002 in August. As of February 2020, 73,426 people had visited the exhibition, and 22,748 visitors attended in the break between COVID-19 restrictions from June 2020-October 2020.

SDS offers detailed assessment and evidence-based, individual, group and family treatment without significant disruption to education, family or leisure. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of SDS has contributed to a shift away from inpatient treatment to an intensive community service delivery for longer term and more cost-effective results (average of £3,700 per patient). NHS England has now allocated £50,000,000 to post-discharge support for these patients. SDS has received international interest, with German adoption under the name ‘Hot-BITs’ (Home Treatment Brings Inpatient Treatments outside), with estimated treatment cost saving of over EUR 6,000 per patient.

<h6>Improving the management of physical health in people with severe mental illness in the UK NHS and internationally</h6>
<p>This research identified the widening mortality gap for people with severe mental illness (SMI) and led to efforts to improve the management of physical health in people with severe mental illness in the UK NHS and internationally. This research has contributed to the development of new prediction tools and management strategies for people with severe mental illness (SMI) that have been adopted across the NHS, such as the use of the Lester tool for cardiovascular screening. This research led to the inclusion of annual cardiovascular screening for all patients with SMI as a central principal of the NHS 2019 Long Term Plan. It was fundamental to the development of a RightCare pathway for people with SMI in local health systems in England -- recommending use of the PRIMROSE intervention, an evidence-based, nurse-led service. It has also driven new guidelines worldwide on the need to effectively manage physical health among people with SMI, including The American Association Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Schizophrenia (2019), The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (2018), the physical health of people with severe mental illness (Ireland’s Mental Health Commission, 2018), and the Excess Mortality in Persons with Severe Mental Disorders (2016).

<p>Partnered with the National Trust (NT) in a public programming project to provide a series of exhibitions, workshops, outreach events, films, blog posts, and staff training exercises to bring public attention to the ‘sleep crisis’ and offer information and solutions based on historical research of how we used to sleep. The Tudor properly, Little Moreton Hall (LMH), hosted the bulk of the programme of events. 79,000 visitors in 2017 participated in the ‘Sleep Walk’ that demonstrated historic bedtime routines, bi-phasic sleep patterns, and sleep remedies. An increase in the number of visitors from 76,000 to 79,000 in 2017 was attributed to this attraction. The success of this partnership contributed to the NT being awarded the status of Independent Research Organisation by the AHRC on behalf of UKRI in 2019. The Children’s Sleep Charity and the British Academy partnered with ICS researchers to repurpose the educational materials developed through the NT outreach and events to engage school communities, comparing past and present healthcare strategies in relation to sleep and wellbeing, and improving public understanding of sleep’s importance for physical and mental health. The partnership with the CSC achieved the Foundation for Social Impact Award for ‘Small Charity, Big Achiever’, and the Royal Society for Public Health Award for ‘Children and Young People’.

<h6>The recognition of Aboriginal land and resource-related rights and claims, primarily in the common-law jurisdictions of Australasia and North America, as matters of legal status, political and historical treatment.</h6>
<p>This research has caused widespread change in the concept of aboriginal land/resource title and has fundamentally changed the relationship between aboriginal people and the state. It has underpinned the reversal of the conception that aboriginal territories held by the British Crown were terrae nullius (nobody’s land), rather than territories subject to the authority of indigenous polities.

","<h6>Nimrud: documenting, contextualising, and planning for an ancient Assyrian heritage site in post-ISIS Iraq</h6>
<p>Research on Nimrud’s ancient and modern history conducted before, during, and after ISIS destruction of ancient Assyrian buildings and sculptures at the archaeological site, informed understanding of Nimrud’s importance as the world’s first imperial capital and its complex, politicised history over the last two centuries. The research contributed to protection and management plans, including UNESCO’s safeguarding activities at Nimrud, and UNESCO Iraq and the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities’ decision to enclose the site and install 24-hour guards to prevent further looting. Research led to the founding of the AHRC-GCRF-funded Nahrein Network in 2017 to support locally led interdisciplinary research in the role of history, heritage, and the humanities in the development of post-conflict Iraq and its neighbours. This has raised the international profile of Iraqi experts and contributed to the decolonisation of knowledge practices. The Nahrein Network is an example of successful collaboration between researchers and Iraqi stakeholders, and in autumn 2020 the network secured £11 million to continue its activities until 2031.

<h6>Informing British Democracy: The Impact of the British Election Study on the Media, Polling, and Political Party Decision-making</h6>
<p>The British Election Study (BES), led by the University of Manchester team since 2013, collaborated with ITV News to shape coverage of the 2015, 2017, and 2019 General Elections, as well as the 2016 EU Referendum. Traditional coverage relied on analysis of aggregate level data, leading to false representation of individual voters and groups. The new approach, using survey date collected before and during election campaigns, allowed ITV to better inform the audience of voter opinions and motivations. The BES research was increasingly cited following the UoM team taking over, with a more than ten-fold increase in print media articles mentioning the BES in the 6 years since UoM took over. BES research has impacted British democracy by providing data which shapes the behaviour of the Conservative and Labour parties through understanding of voter movements, campaign resources, and post-election analyses.

<h6>Anthropological insights improve the humanitarian response to Ebola</h6>
<p>The public health response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa between 2014 and 2016 faltered for a variety of reasons, many of which were social and cultural (e.g., mortuary and burial practices) but also political and economic (the sodalities managing burial practices in the region were also essential components of the political system). Researchers leveraged anthropological research to create the Ebola Response Anthropology Platform (ERAP) to provide social analysis to enable effective medical response and offer real-time advice during such outbreaks. ERAP authored 40 rapid response briefings, solicited by DFID, MOD, WHO, UNMEER, Christian Aid, and others, which drew 16,000 users to their website. ERAP’s insights aided such organisations and individuals in navigating social resistance to humanitarian responses by involving local communities. ERAP has now been renamed the Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform (SSHAP), and this platform model is now informing the COVID-19 response.

<h6>Preventing Railway Suicide</h6>
<p>59% of Transport for London (TfL) staff have received suicide prevention training at date of ICS authorship. Has resulted in an unprecedented drop in suicide of a third in two years (the first two-year consecutive drop for almost 20 years, despite a rise in UK suicide rate by all methods). The PI of the project received a ‘Lifesaver Award’ by TfL in 2019. A team led by the PI received recognition as a ‘Nation’s Lifesaver’ for research carried out between 2018-2020 (‘the top 100 individuals or groups based in universities across the country whose work is saving lives and making a life-changing difference to our health and wellbeing’). The award-winning Small Talk Saves Lives media campaign launched in November 2017 was developed by the Samaritans and RSSG with direct and ongoing input from the research team, based on their findings that suicidal thoughts at railways are often temporary. Extensive media coverage created 158 million opportunities for people to see or hear the campaign. This has inspired similar campaigns in the Netherlands (where railway suicides reduced by 10% in 2019), Germany, and Japan. It also inspired the Thames Water Safety Forum to create a new Drowning Prevention Strategy.

<p>Naloxone saves lives by reversing the effects of opioid overdose. Researchers pioneered the concept of pre-providing naloxone to laypeople, known as Take-Home Naloxone (THN), which led to the development of a medically approved naloxone nasal spray as a safer, easier mode of administration than injection. The United Nations (UN) and World Health Organisation (WHO) subsequently endorsed THN and recommended its wider provision globally. Over 23 countries have now implemented THN programmes, with the US alone having committed an extra $180 million in funding. Increased distribution of this intervention across the world ensures that opioid users, carers, and families have THN ready for when they need it, to save lives.
