2,4,Productivity,Business & Industry,"In this topic, we find research that supports and informs business, entrepreneurialism, management and policies aimed at improving productivity and firm growth in various forms. Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies and financial opportunities that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient or better managed: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research. Several projects are also concerned with sustainable practices in business and entrepreneurialism for a greener economy.","<h6>Accelerating the Multi-Unit Leader and Service Chain Growth</h6>

Developmental teaching approaches underpinned by UK University research in partnership with various international institutions has placed language-learning at the heart of education. Emphasis on supporting multilingual communities in safeguarding and sharing their linguistic heritage has helped to strength local communities and aid the integration of refugee and other vulnerable minority groups. Impact in this topic has focused on developing language teaching tools which can be used in a range of contexts, whether it be aiding in second language teaching for students with SpLDs or creating international teaching partnerships to enable language mentoring. Case studies in this strand often participate in the preservation and recovery of native languages, particularly Gaelic. Welsh-language learning tools, often capitalising on the opportunity for crowd-sourcing knowledge online, have made impressive strides in boosting public interest in Welsh learning.
