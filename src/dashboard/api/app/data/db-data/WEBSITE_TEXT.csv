Please select a topic from the left panel to see results for Impact Case Studies within that topic.

The project was tendered via a competitive process to provide a robust evidence base for the higher education sector and policymakers to articulate the value of research and its impact on society in the UK and around the world. The report – and this accompanying online dashboard – aims to serve as a starting point for the SHAPE community to explore the scope and reach of the evidence base. Please read our <a href=""./data/SHAPEImpact_04Sept23.pdf"" target=""_blank"">full report</a> to learn more about the project and its results.</p><p>This work leverages the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 Impact Case Study (ICS) dataset to reveal new insights about the contribution of SHAPE to the wellbeing of society, culture and the economy. The REF is the UK’s system for assessing the quality of research in UK higher education providers, with results used to inform the distribution of approximately £2 billion per year of public funding for universities’ research. The publication of impact case studies presents an opportunity for the research community to demonstrate the broader footprint of their published research and to recognise the achievements and successes of research across the UK.</p><p>We develop a novel mixed-method approach that combines in-depth narrative interviews (N=48) to reveal the stories and successes of the impact of research as well as a questionnaire to SHAPE panel members (N=263) with the most advanced machine learning models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify key topical clusters of SHAPE impact. We focus on ICS submitted within SHAPE disciplines, in the Social Sciences (Panel C, N=2,146), Arts and Humanities (Panel D, N=1,528) and Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience (Unit of Assessment 4, N=528), sometimes in comparison to other non-SHAPE disciplines (total ICS N=6,361). We supplement the REF2021 ICS database with newly engineered fields, our topic models, the scientometric Dimensions database, REF environment, and REF quality databases. The project was overseen by a steering group consisting of representatives from business, academia, major funders, and Fellows of the British Academy and the Academy of Social Sciences.</p>",<h4>How to use this dashboard</h4><p>Navigate the dashboard to explore research impact case studies submitted by academic instituions in the United Kingdom to the 2021 Research Excellence Framework.</p><p>Click on elements of the dashboard to filter results to impact case studies that most interest you:<ul><li>Select a topic from the left panel to filter results to research in a topic area.</li><li>Gain an understanding of the topic by reading the narrative with examples of impact case studies in this research area.</li><li>Filter results by funder by clicking on bars in the funder barplot</li><li>Filter results by the postcode of UK academic instituions by clicking the top-left map</li><li>Filter results by country of research beneficiaries by clicking the bottom-right map</li><li>Filter results by units of assessment by selecting items from the drop-down list in the bottom-left panel</li><li>View and download our enhanced REF database for the filtered set of impact case studies by clicking “View and Download Data: Impact Case Studies” in the bottom-left of the dashboard</li><li>Explore advanced options by clicking the menu icon in the top-right of the dashboard</li></ul></p>,"<div class=""card mb-3""><div class=""row g-0""><div class=""col-md-4 p-3""><img src=""./img/staff/melinda.png"" class=""img-fluid shadow"" style=""border-radius:50%""><div class=""box mt-3"" style=""display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;font-size:1.3rem""><div><ul class=""list-inline""><li class=""list-inline-item""><a href=""https://www.demography.ox.ac.uk/people/melinda-mills"" target=""_blank"" class=""text-secondary""><i class=""far fa-address-card""></i></a></li><li class=""list-inline-item""><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/melinda-mills-95820620/"" target=""_blank"" class=""text-secondary""><i class=""fab fa-linkedin-in""></i></a></li><li class=""list-inline-item""><a href=""https://twitter.com/melindacmills"" target=""_blank"" class=""text-secondary""><i class=""fab fa-twitter""></i></a></li><li class=""list-inline-item""><a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HX9KQ5MAAAAJ"" target=""_blank"" class=""text-secondary""><i class=""fab fa-google""></i></a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class=""col-md-8""><div class=""card-body""><h5 class=""card-title fw-bold"">Melinda Mills MBE FBA FAcSS</h5><h5 class=""card-title"">Director, Professor of Demography</h5><p class=""card-text"">Melinda Mills is Director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science and Nuffield Professor of Demography.

He studies some of the well-documented problems of classical approaches to quantitative work and how these can be tackled by selectively applying methods from other disciplines using more flexible methods, like those in machine learning. Examples of such problems are linearity and additivity assumptions, and issues around researcher degrees of freedom. Mark argues that computational methods can be used hand-in-hand with classical approaches to empirical work, and that they are complementary to one another. To illustrate the added value of computational methods, Mark applies these approaches in both substantive case studies in the social sciences, as well as simulation results. Some of these cases include topics from Educational Research, Law and Economics, and Health, amongst others.
