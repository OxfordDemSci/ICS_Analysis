# About

<h4>The SHAPE of Impact</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/" target="_blank">British Academy</a> and the <a href="https://acss.org.uk/" target="_blank">Academy of Social Sciences</a> commissioned researchers from the <a href="https://www.demography.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science</a> at the University of Oxford to examine and uncover <i>“the stories, successes and cumulative effects on people, the economy, policy and society of the impact of research in the SHAPE disciplines (Social Sciences, Humanities and the Arts for People and the Economy/Environment)”</i> within the United Kingdom’s <a href="https://www.ref.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Research Excellence Framework of 2021 (REF2021)</a>. The project was tendered via a competitive process to provide a robust evidence base for the higher education sector and policymakers to articulate the value of research and its impact on society in the UK and around the world. The report – and this accompanying online dashboard – aims to serve as a starting point for the SHAPE community to explore the scope and reach of the evidence base.</p>

<p>This work leverages the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 Impact Case Study (ICS) dataset to reveal new insights about the contribution of SHAPE to the wellbeing of society, culture and the economy. The REF is the UK’s system for assessing the quality of research in UK higher education providers, with results used to inform the distribution of approximately £2 billion per year of public funding for universities’ research. The publication of impact case studies presents an opportunity for the research community to demonstrate the broader footprint of their published research and to recognise the achievements and successes of research across the UK.</p>

<p>We develop a novel mixed-method approach that combines in-depth narrative interviews (N=48) to reveal the stories and successes of the impact of research as well as a questionnaire to SHAPE panel members (N=263) with the most advanced machine learning models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify key topical clusters of SHAPE impact. We focus on ICS submitted within SHAPE disciplines, in the Social Sciences (Panel C, N=2,146), Arts and Humanities (Panel D, N=1,528) and Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience (Unit of Assessment 4, N=528), sometimes in comparison to other non-SHAPE disciplines (total ICS N=6,361). We supplement the REF2021 ICS database with newly engineered fields, our topic models, the scientometric Dimensions database, REF environment, and REF quality databases. The project was overseen by a steering group consisting of representatives from business, academia, major funders, and Fellows of the British Academy and the Academy of Social Sciences. </p>

The SHAPE of Impact project was undertaken by researchers at <a href="https://www.demography.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science</a> at the University of Oxford. LCDS is an interdisciplinary research centre funded by the Leverhulme Trust and directed by Professor Melinda Mills which aims to disrupt and realign how we measure and model populations, by infusing new types of data, methods and unconventional approaches to tackle the most challenging demographic problems of our time. LCDS is embedded within Nuffield College and Oxford Population Health (Nuffield Department of Population Health) at the University of Oxford, which contains world-renowned population health research groups and is an excellent environment for multi-disciplinary teaching and research. LCDS brings together multiple departments and disciplines from demography, population health, statistics, epidemiology, molecular genetics, economics, statistics, biology, zoology, history, sociology, marketing and business.</p>

Melinda Mills is Director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science and Nuffield Professor of Demography. Her main research areas are combining a social science and genetic approach to the study of behavioural outcomes, with a focus on reproduction (fertility), chronotype, nonstandard, precarious employment and assortative mating. Mills has published 7 books and over 100 articles in the highest academic journals across multiple scientific disciplines including Nature Genetics, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Annual Review of Sociology, JAMA Psychiatry, Journal of Marriage and Family and Social Forces. Her books on globalization, uncertainty and life course have garnered considerable citations, as has her work on fertility and reproductive behaviour. She has written 2 statistical textbooks, Introducing Survival and Event History Analysis (in R) (2011) and An Introduction to Statistical Genetic Data Analysis (MIT, 2020). Mills has supervised over 20 PhD students, 50 Master students and around 15 postdoctoral researchers. Professor Melinda Mills conceived and oversaw the SHAPE of Impact project.</p>


<h4>Dr. Sander Wagner</h4>
<h5>Research Associate</h5>
<p><img src="./img/staff/sander.jpg" alt="Dr. Sander Wagner" style="width:200px; float: left; margin-right: 1em">
Sander Wagner’s research is focussed on the interplay of demographics and socio-economic outcomes, with a particular focus on labour-market consequences of motherhood, how demographics and the distribution of wealth interact and the use of large registry datasets for comparative research. He is currently the PI of the LMCM (Labour Market Consequences of Motherhood) project concerned with making German and French registry data comparable and using it to measure labour market consequences of childbirth. He is also working on Danish registry data to look at how demographic lifecourse events such as partnering and childbirth affect individuals position in the wealth distribution. In addition to this he has ongoing projects in the field of digital demography, using new datasources to measure discrimination and in historical demography about the consequences of the 1918 Spanish Flu. Sander Wagner is also a Good Judgment Project superforecaster and interested in how to apply different forecasting techniques to demographic research. Dr. Wagner led qualitative aspects of the SHAPE of Impact project as well as analysing questionnaire data.</p>

<h4>Dr. Mark Verhagen</h4>
<h5>Postdoctoral Research Consultant</h5>
<p><img src="./img/staff/mark.webp" alt="Dr. Mark Verhagen" style="width:200px; float: left; margin-right: 1em">
Mark focuses in his work on including computational methods into the workflow of the empirical social scientist. He studies some of the well-documented problems of classical approaches to quantitative work and how these can be tackled by selectively applying methods from other disciplines using more flexible methods, like those in machine learning. Examples of such problems are linearity and additivity assumptions, and issues around researcher degrees of freedom. Mark argues that computational methods can be used hand-in-hand with classical approaches to empirical work, and that they are complementary to one another. To illustrate the added value of computational methods, Mark applies these approaches in both substantive case studies in the social sciences, as well as simulation results. Some of these cases include topics from Educational Research, Law and Economics, and Health, amongst others. Dr. Verhagen led aspects of the SHAPE of Impact project related to open science and data engineering.</p>
