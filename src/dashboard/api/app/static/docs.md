# UK Vehicle Registration API (v1)

The UK Vehicle Registration API allows you to access vehicle registration data and
MOT test results for specific dates and post-code areas. These data describe 
miles driven, tailpipe emissions, vehicle values, and other information relevant
to population health, social inequalities, and demographics of vehicles. 
Web developers can use this API to develop web applications that query our 
database on-the-fly based on the needs of their own web applications and users.
