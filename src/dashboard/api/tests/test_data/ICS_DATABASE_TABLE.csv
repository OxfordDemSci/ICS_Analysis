 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dermatological conditions cause patient suffering and poor quality\-of\-life. Prior to Cardiff research, no standard method existed to assess the impact of skin diseases on patient wellbeing. The Cardiff\-developed Dermatology Life Quality Index \(DLQI\) is now a vital clinical assessment tool, licensed for use 1601 times in the current REF period. The DLQI is also part of 15 new NICE Technology Appraisals and has been included in clinical practice guidelines in a further 31 countries worldwide. DLQI licence revenues currently stand at £3.5 million during this REF period, complementing extensive use \(free of charge\) by the NHS and other non\-profit organisations. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Skin conditions, such as eczema, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, affect around 60% of the adult population in the UK at some point in their lifetime \( *British Skin Foundation*\), and these can severely impact quality\-of\-life, as well as patient wellbeing **.** To support enhanced consideration of patient disability and wellbeing, the Dermatology Life Quality Index \(DLQI\) was developed by researchers at Cardiff University, via research published in 1994. This simple\-to\-use questionnaire focuses on patients' perception of the impact of skin diseases on different aspects of their health\-related quality\-of\-life over the previous week. 

 **2.1 The history of the Dermatology Life Quality Index** 

 Between 2002 and 2004, the DLQI was further developed by research undertaken in almost 2,000 patients, with the publication of validated score bandings designed to enhance its use with patients, specifically with a score above 10 reflecting a major impact of disease on quality\-of\-life **\[3.1\]**. As stated in the prior REF2014 impact case on the DLQI, “ *This breakthrough meant that the DLQI could be used to enhance appropriateness of clinical decisions, to audit dermatology services, to assess new drugs and to inform resource allocation*”. The Cardiff research also ensured that psoriasis severity could be usefully defined using DLQI scores **\[3.2\]**. 

 **2.2 New research enhancing global reach and clinical applicability** 

 Subsequent to these DLQI publications, the Cardiff team undertook additional extensive research designed to enhance the utility of the DLQI in clinical settings, broadening its global reach and variety of clinical applications, including into clinical trials and drug development studies. Specific research outcomes from these studies included: 

 **a. Improved sensitivity** 

 To enhance the sensitivity of the DLQI to meaningful improvements in quality\-of\-life reported by patients, the Cardiff team refined the interpretation of the DLQI’s Minimal Clinically Important Difference \(MCID\) score **\[3.3\]**. The MCID is the smallest change in the clinical assessment that can be used to determine response to therapy or a need to alter patient management. Refinement of the DLQI altered the MCID from 5 to 4, which improved the DLQI’s validity, reliability and interpretation of change. Specifically, this outcome meant that a treatment intervention scoring 4 \(rather than 5\) on the DLQI would be considered to have made a difference to a patient’s quality\-of\-life. This improved the utility of the DLQI as a clinical management tool and prevented an underestimate of the clinical response to therapy **\[3.3\]**. 

 **b. Digital delivery of the DLQI** 

 The Cardiff team noted that clinicians were increasingly using non\-validated electronic versions of the DLQI, in line with a general increase in the use of patient\-reported measures in electronic format. There was a concern about whether underlying data from the electronic versions were comparable with those from the validated paper DLQI. In a study of patients from a hospital dermatology outpatient clinic **\[G3.1\]**, the Cardiff team validated the digital delivery and completion of the DLQI on iPads in comparison to paper format, demonstrating that patients answered both questionnaires in a similar way **\[3.4\]**. In addition to providing patients with an alternate validated version of the DLQI, the e\-format DLQI provides opportunities for real\-time monitoring of quality\-of\-life and an easier transfer of data to patient records. 

 **c. Linking the DLQI to health utility estimates** 

 Health utility estimates provide a measure of a patient’s preference for a given health\-related outcome. These are often used in health economic models and by pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate the value of a health intervention. Previously it wasn’t possible to calculate health utility values from the DLQI. Instead, to calculate these for skin conditions, a generic health instrument, such as the European Quality of Life\-5 Dimension \(EQ\-5D\), was required. Use of multiple measures can be burdensome for patients and clinicians, however, and there are often challenges integrating data from more than one measure. 

 The Cardiff team developed a new validated method to calculate EQ\-5D data and utility values from DLQI scores, removing the need to administer multiple measures **\[3.5\]**. They used data from a multicentre European study investigating more than 24 skin diseases and involving over 4,000 participants, on which Finlay acted as a Study Advisor **\[3.6\]**. The new validated method **\[3.5\]** enables disease\-specific DLQI data to be mapped onto health utility measures, which can then be used in economic analyses, increasing the value of DLQI data \(e.g., in the evaluation of drug efficacy in clinical trials \(see section 4\), and in regulatory approvals by European and international agencies\). 

 In summary, Cardiff research enhanced the applicability of the DLQI in clinical and health economic settings by improving the DLQI’s sensitivity in identifying meaningful differences in quality of life for patients, by validating the utility of an electronic version of the DLQI as an alternative to the paper format and enabling health economic measures to be calculated directly from DLQI data.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Prior to Cardiff’s development of the DLQI, including the generation of validated score bands for enhanced clinical use **\[3.1\]**, there was no simple, and standardised quality\-of\-life measure for the clinical assessment of dermatological conditions. Highlighting the vital importance of the DLQI, the World Health Organisation notes that the questionnaire “ *is currently the most frequently used method of evaluating quality of life for patients with different skin conditions*” **\[5.1**, p.18 **\]**. Further systematic review validated the DLQI as the most commonly used instrument for quality\-of\-life assessment in psoriasis **\[5.2\]**. 

 The 2005 publication of new, simple, quality\-of\-life assessment bandings accelerated DLQI’s use in clinical settings, including increased use of the DLQI by the pharmaceutical industry as part of drug development studies. Inclusion of the DLQI in critical national and international guidelines, as well as the successful move towards a digital format \(see section 4.2\), further extended the reach of the tool, across multiple countries, generating new income for Cardiff University. 

#  4.1 Increased use of the DLQI in drug development and clinical trials 

 During this REF period, 1601 licences for the DLQI were issued, of which 826 were for commercial use, generating revenue of over £3.5 million \(with annual revenue increasing year on year\) **\[5.3\]**. Since Cardiff’s validation of the e\-format DLQI in 2017 **\[3.4\]**, 314 requests were granted for use of an e\-format DLQI between 2018 and 2020, compared to 82 requests between 2013 and 2016 prior to validation **\[5.4\]**. Licenses purchased by pharmaceutical companies are typically used for clinical trials, contributing to the successful development approval of novel biologics for dermatological conditions. For example, the DLQI was a key patient reported outcome measure in the Sanofi funded Phase III trials SOLO 1 and 2, CHRONOS and CAFÉ, which tested the effectiveness of dupilumab in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis **\[5.5\]**. Based on successful trial outcomes, dupilumab was approved for use by NICE with the DLQI recommended as the sole quality of life measure for treatment efficacy **\[5.6\]**.  Furthermore, the trials made use of the new Cardiff\-led MCID score of 4 rather than 5 **\[3.3\]**, ensuring patient benefit from dupilumab intervention was accurately recorded. 

 The Cardiff team’s new validated method to calculate EuroQol \(EQ\-5D\) data and utility values from DLQI scores **\[3.5\]**, which then feed into health economics analyses, has been requested 15 times by pharmaceutical companies and researchers undertaking clinical trials in this REF period \(detailed information cannot be provided due to confidentiality agreements\) **\[5.4\]**. 

#  4.2 Inclusion of the DLQI in national and professional guidelines 

 The DLQI is utilised worldwide and forms part of national guidelines and treatment registries for a diversity of dermatological conditions in 45 countries. Thirty\-one of these country guidelines/registries are new recommendations added between 2014 and 2019, a more than 100% increase from the last REF period. Additional countries since the prior REF 2014 case, with national guidelines that recommend use of DLQI for skin diseases, include the USA, New Zealand, China, Germany, France, as well Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela **\[5.7\]**. 

 As noted in the REF 2014 case, NICE recommended the use of the DLQI for clinical monitoring and informing clinical decisions of patients with severe psoriasis and hand eczema in England and Wales. Within the current REF period, the DLQI score was additionally included as part of recommendations in 15 further NICE Technology Appraisals and Evidence Summaries, as a clinical threshold for treatment decisions or sensitive indicator of response for other dermatological conditions \(e.g., atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriatic arthritis, hyperhidrosis and rosacea\) **\[5.6\]**. Additionally, the NICE clinical guideline for psoriasis \(CG153\) was reviewed in late 2017, with the DLQI the single assessment measure noted for use in the condition, specifically as a “ *validated tool to assess the impact of any type of psoriasis on physical, psychological and social wellbeing”* **\[5.6\]**. 

#  4.3 Establishing global use of the DLQI 

 Over the REF period, there have been a further 34 validated translations of the DLQI, and it is now available in 125 languages **\[5.8\]**. As a result, the DLQI has now been used in research studies and clinical trials in 62 countries, covering over 70 diseases. 

 The DLQI was recommended as a core outcome measure for all clinical research studies and in the assessment and management of atopic eczema by the Harmonizing Outcome Measures for Eczema \(HOME\) group **\[5.9\]**. HOME includes over 300 members across the world \(e.g., patients, healthcare professionals, journal editors, regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies\) and focuses on identifying the best consensus\-based outcome measures for clinical research and management of atopic eczema **\[5.9\]**. 

 The critical importance of the DLQI is further illustrated by its wide use as the “gold standard” with which to cross validate new measures, with 44 published new measures validated against the DLQI within the 2014\-2019 period **\[5.10\]**. These measures include both patient\-reported outcome measures and other disease activity measures, and cover conditions such as alopecia, atopic dermatitis, albinism, and non\-melanoma skin cancer. 

#  Since REF2014, the DLQI has become a widely used international assessment tool, benefiting a wide range of stakeholders, including patients, clinicians and pharmaceutical companies. This is reflected in its inclusion in a large number of guidelines worldwide. As a critical outcome measure for drug development and clinical trials, licensing revenue increased over the REF period. The critical role DLQI plays in routine clinical practice is well\-evidenced, with an editorial from the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology stating: *“Andrew Finlay and his team have given a voice to all our patients in everyday consultation. This contributes to a new way of practicing medicine and dermatology, putting the patient in the centre, making a person\-centred consultation”* \[5.11\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted at SOAS on arbitration within African States and by Africans internationally raised the visibility of African arbitrators and fuelled collaborations between key stakeholders. Even though a growing number of claims involving African parties are brought to arbitration, statistics show that a very limited number of Africans act as international arbitrators, including in Africa\-connected disputes. Dr Onyema’s research and the series of conferences she led – all held in African countries – inspired domestic and international arbitration\-related organisations to implement changes in their appointment practices, thereby increasing opportunities for African arbitration practitioners both in and outside Africa. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Arbitration is a legal mechanism for the resolution of disputes outside the courts. Parties involved refer the dispute to one or more persons \(the ‘arbitrators’, or ‘arbitral tribunal’\) whose decision has the same force as the judgement of a court. Arbitration is a private process and the details are usually not published; it is primarily used in commercial disputes between parties, such as between two companies or between a government and a company, from different countries. Official statistics from the International Chamber of Commerce \(ICC\) and the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes \(ICSID\) show that even though a growing number of claims involving African parties are brought to arbitration, a very limited number of Africans act as international arbitrators, even in Africa\-connected disputes. 

 Since 2014, Dr Emilia Onyema \(Reader in International Commercial Law at SOAS from 2007\) has conducted research to investigate the use of arbitration in African States and the depth of the participation of Africans in international arbitration **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. Through conducting research at the library at the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, Onyema explored available data on the role of Africa \(as seat, arbitral centres and arbitrators\) in international arbitration. The review showed very low participation of Africa in international arbitration references **\[3.3, 3.5\]**. There was no empirical evidence of the reasons for this low participation, but the general perception was that this was the result of: \(1\) lack of arbitration expertise in Africa; \(2\) unsupportive courts that are hostile towards arbitration; and \(3\) poor legal infrastructure. 

 To further interrogate these issues and fill the information gap, Onyema designed a four\-year conference\-based research project, which aimed at understanding the reality of arbitration\-related resources \(and gaps\) in Africa, and to increase the visibility of African arbitration practitioners. Each conference focused on interrogating the role of one major arbitration stakeholder \(arbitral centres, courts/judges, states, practitioners\) in Africa. The first conference \(African Union, Addis Ababa – Ethiopia\) explored the role of arbitration centres. The information collected at the event allowed Onyema to publish a list of 71 arbitration centres operating in 39 different African countries. It was the first time such a list – which was made publicly available – had been published. The second conference \(Lagos Court of Arbitration – Nigeria, 2016\) explored the role of judges and national courts and critically examined their disposition towards arbitration. It found that jurisdictions whose laws and courts pursue a cooperative interaction between arbitration and litigation are generally perceived as being supportive of arbitration; and that this perception alone attracts international arbitration disputes, with its economic benefits. However, jurisdictions where judges are perceived to needlessly interfere with the arbitral process do not attract international arbitration disputes. Therefore, countries wishing to attract more international arbitration disputes need to modernize their arbitration\-related laws and their judges need to be supportive of the arbitral process **\[3.4\]**. 

 The third conference \(Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration, CRCICA – Egypt, 2017\) examined the substantive content of arbitration laws of various African countries and the attitude of African governments towards arbitration. It also looked at non\-legal factors relevant to making African countries attractive venues for international arbitration. This conference found that various African governments understand the need to modernise their arbitration laws and align to the UNCITRAL Model Law of International Commercial Arbitration. Governments also agreed on the need to appoint more African counsel and arbitrators and build their internal legal capacities. The fourth conference \(Kigali International Arbitration Centre – Rwanda, 2018\) focused on arbitration practitioners \(lawyers and arbitration experts\) and their capacities to meet the needs of disputants in international disputes. Onyema launched the Report from the Arbitration in Africa Survey **\[3.7\]**, which focused on collecting original data from African arbitration practitioners on their experiences in international arbitration. 82% of the 191 African arbitration practitioners that responded did not sit as an arbitrator in international arbitration between 2012 and 2017; 59% did not act as counsel in international arbitration. Respondents blamed poor perception of African arbitration practitioners by their foreign colleagues, bias by those appointing arbitrators in favour of foreign counsel, and the fact that Africans were not appointing fellow Africans as arbitrators **\[3.5, 3.7\]**. These responses provided empirical evidence of the general perceptions for the low participation of Africans in international arbitration. Onyema’s research activities thus demonstrated that African practitioners need to continue to develop their arbitration skills through the growth of the domestic arbitration markets in Africa, and to appoint each other more systematically.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The SOAS Arbitration in Africa conference series organised by Onyema brought together Africans and non\-Africans involved in arbitration in Africa, providing them with a shared space to gather more information on arbitration in Africa, unpack challenges, and explore possible remedial actions including mutual support and regional collaboration. The conferences and the research were praised for making ‘a significant contribution to the development of arbitration in Africa and for evolving the mindset within and beyond Africa over the last five years’ **\[5.1\]**. The conferences raised the visibility of and opportunities for African arbitrators in Africa and outside the continent. In 2019, the President of the East African Community Court, Justice Dr Emmanuel Ugirashebuja, remarked that the SOAS conference series ‘have created a forum that fosters cooperation, collaboration and effective interchange of ideas amongst the African arbitration practitioners and even those beyond Africa” **\[5.10 p203\]**. 

####  Building networks and regional collaboration to enable arbitration to thrive in Africa 

 Throughout the 4\-year research and conferences, Africans engaged in arbitration were brought together to cooperate and form new relationships. The director of CRCICA indicated that ‘SOAS Project is the source and CRCICA will faithfully support the values of the SOAS Project to permit Africa and Africans the place they deserve in the international arbitral justice’ **\[5.2 p3\]**. As a result of the Arbitration in Africa survey **\[3.7\]**, Onyema \(along with Dr Stuart Dutson of Simmons and Simmons, LLP\), designed the African Promise – a pledge which mirrored the Equal Representation Pledge for the promotion of women in international arbitration. Many African arbitration practitioners agreed to adopt this pledge with the goal to ‘Improve the profile and representation of African arbitrators especially in arbitrations connected to Africa’ and to ensure that ‘African arbitrators are appointed as arbitrators on an equal opportunity basis.’ As of 29 July 2020, the Promise had 320 signatures **\[5.3a\]**. To increase inclusiveness, the International Council for Commercial Arbitration \(ICCA\) further expanded the list of African arbitration centres compiled by Onyema **\[5.3b, 5.7 p1\]**. 

 Following the 2017 Cairo conference \(177 participants\), ICCA also led a process that culminated in 2018 with the formation of the African Arbitration Association \(AfAA\). AfAA was created as the continent’s promotional body for international arbitration to support the development of international arbitration in Africa, and to promote its members and their activities in international arbitration and international dispute resolution **\[5.11\]**. Onyema actively participated in the AfAA formation and is a member of its Board of Directors. The CRCICA considered AfAA as ‘the ideal platform to overcome the observed lack of confidence in arbitration in Africa by allowing African practitioners to become more familiar with one another’ **\[5.2 p3\]**. AfAA won the Global Arbitration Review \(GAR\) 2019 Award for ‘Best Development’ in arbitration **\[5.4c\]**. 

 Cooperation between national and regional arbitration centres across Africa also flourished thanks to the research project efforts. Two bilateral MoUs were signed – between CRCICA and KIAC \(Kigali International Arbitration Centre\), and between CRCICA and the Nairobi Centre for International Arbitration – to provide a framework whereby the 2 arbitral institutions can develop a mutually beneficial relationship through the provisions on seminars, conferences and capacity\-building activities, and through exchange of information and collaboration in research as well as exchange of visits **\[5.2, 5.4a, 5.4b\]**. CRCICA also committed to increase the presence of non\-Egyptian African speakers in their conferences and workshops, as well as the number of non\-Egyptian Africans in their Board of Trustees, nominating new Trustees from Cameroun, Nigeria and Tunisia **\[5.2 p2\]**. Africans have the majority of board positions at KIAC in Rwanda **\[5.15\]**. 

 The attitudes and behaviours of African countries, governments, courts and judges towards arbitration also started to change. Engagement of the African arbitration community with judges and attorneys\-general and other government agencies improved. The Global Practice Manager for International Arbitration, noted that ‘On the role of the courts, we all stand indebted to Dr Emilia Onyema for her work . . . has advanced immeasurably our collective knowledge of the views of national courts on arbitration and dispelled many of the myths which have perpetuated for too long.’ **\[5.12\]**. Following the Lagos conference \(2016, 115 participants\), the Chief Justice of Nigeria Walter Samuel Nkanu Onnoghen wrote a letter admonishing the judges in Nigeria to honour arbitration agreements **\[5.5\]**. 

 *Increasing the number of and opportunities for Africans active in domestic and international arbitration* 

 The research was fundamental to increase capacity\-building initiatives, development and career growth opportunities for arbitration practitioners in Africa – which led to a growing number of African arbitrators being appointed in key positions. Following the 2017 Cairo conference, in response to one of the challenges faced by young African arbitrators and highlighted by the research, a senior partner at Nassar Law, Cairo accepted to host one African candidate for a one\-month internship in Cairo. This offer attracted 82 applicants; a female applicant from Nigeria, was chosen. She said of her experience, ‘I was exposed to precedents and processes, learning more about how an arbitral panel thinks while it resolves disputes that come before it. I learnt more about the arbitration process, particularly how counsel and arbitrators work together to prepare for final hearings and how final awards are drafted’ **\[5.13\]**. Young practitioners attending the 2018 Kigali conference \(250 participants\) identified the unaffordability of arbitration conference attendance for themselves and African students as a hindrance to their career development. This led to the creation of the Arbitration Fund for African Students \(AFAS\) which was launched at the 2019 Arusha conference to fund African students to participate in international arbitration\-related moots and conferences, as well as to provide a website with arbitration\-related educational information **\[5.6\]**. Six African students applied to obtain funds to attend a commercial arbitration moot in Vienna in the first round in late 2019, though the event was cancelled as a result of COVID\-19 **\[5.14\]**. 

 Arbitration centres in Africa began to increase the number of African arbitrators they appointed. For example, CRCICA appointed more arbitrators from different African states such as Nigeria, Sudan and Tunisia. The Centre made it a point to include more and more non\-Egyptian African arbitrators in the lists proposed to the parties under its ‘identical list procedure’ used to appoint sole and presiding arbitrators **\[5.2 p3\]**. In 2018, the Centre appointed 20 non\-Egyptian arbitrators, and a further 4 the following year. In 2019, the Centre registered the second highest number of cases in its history: 82 new cases were filed, compared to 77 and 65 in 2018 and 2017 respectively \[5.4d p2 and p1\]. KIAC also received ‘a record’ 33 cases from July 2019 to June 2020, with over a third classed as international in nature, which KIAC noted as ‘a statement of confidence that Rwanda is playing a key role in positioning Africa on the market of international arbitration, as well as its global appeal to users from diverse legal systems and cultures’ **\[5.4f p2\]**. 

 In May 2016, ICCA established a Working Group on African Arbitral Practice intended to consolidate the impact of the first ICCA Congress held in Africa \(2016 ICCA Mauritius Congress\). The Working Group hosted a ‘Consultative Workshop for African Arbitral Initiatives’ in May 2016 in Mauritius, which was attended by Onyema and where her research was shared with over 40 representatives of African arbitral institutes, practitioners and capacity\-building initiatives active on the continent. The ICCA stated that the research proved ‘a strong motivation for participants to agree to work together in sharing resources and entering into collaborative arrangements’ **\[5.7 p1\]**. ICCA organised more consultative workshops as side events to the SOAS\-led conferences in Egypt, Nigeria and Rwanda. Thanks to the expanded list of African arbitration centres from the 2015 Addis Ababa conference \(61 participants\), ICCA identified potential partners in Africa for Africa\-related projects **\[5.7. p1 and p2\]**. The ICCA Executive Body affirmed its commitment to advance the practice of arbitration in Africa, through ICCA projects such as the Young ICCA workshops, the distribution of complimentary publications to African arbitral institutes, and the creation of access to opportunities for African arbitrators at ICCA Congresses **\[5.7 p2\]**. Before cancellation due to COVID\-19, the 2020 Edinburgh ICCA Congress had planned to host 7 Africans as speakers, with Babatunde Fagbohunlu from Nigeria as a member of its programming committee **\[5.4e\]**. Other conferences also raised the visibility of and opportunities for African arbitrators outside Africa: the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Dispute \(ICSID\) – the world’s leading institution devoted to international investment dispute settlement – reacted to the global discourse on diversity in international arbitration by both nominating and appointing more Africans onto their Tribunals between 2015 and 2019, rising from 34 to 51 **\[5.8\]**. For example, in December 2019 the ICSID constituted a panel with 2 Africans as arbitrators: Nigerian Christopher Adebayo Ojo, appointed by the claimant, and Gérard Niyungeko from Burundi, appointed by the respondent **\[5.9\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by the Centre on Migration, Policy and Society \(COMPAS\) at the University of Oxford led to the establishment of a knowledge\-exchange network with a core group of European cities that has now directly engaged 44 cities in an unprecedented dialogue on a highly sensitive issue: municipal service provision to irregular \(‘illegal’\) migrants. The network – the *City Initiative on Migrants with Irregular Status \(C\-MISE*\)  – has published comprehensive guidance and a video documentary, promoted to 47 countries by the Council of Europe and to 140 cities by the Intercultural Cities network. This work has already led to reforms by 8 cities relating to additional provision of healthcare, shelter, legal advice and other services, impacting on migrants and other residents; and to a linked, city\-led, parallel initiative in Italy. For the UK, the research directly led to an award\-winning, online diagnostic tool, used 39,616 times by local authorities, advice agencies and individuals, to assess eligibility of destitute migrant children for shelter and subsistence support. The EU Victims Strategy \(2020\) adopted a research recommendation to extend protection to victims with irregular status. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Centre on Migration, Policy and Society \(COMPAS\) is within the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography at the University of Oxford. COMPAS led a research programme on national and municipal responses to irregular \(‘undocumented’ or ‘illegal’\) migrants \(2012\-2020\) consisting of three related studies: 

1.  The first study \(2012\-2018\) by Spencer, Hughes and Delvino, investigated national and municipal policy responses to irregular migrants in continental Europe \( **R1\)**.  Irregular migrants are not authorised to be in the country and service provision to them is a sensitive issue. The aim was to investigate the apparent paradox that irregular migrants are provided with some public services while simultaneously subject to removal from the country by immigration authorities. The researchers conducted the first mapping of national legal provisions on access to healthcare and education across the then EU28, revealing a starkly uneven geography of rights and restrictions \( **R4**\), including for children \( **R3**\). More than 100 interviews with policy makers and civil society representatives in 14 countries were conducted to establish the reasons for provision of services, including access to shelter and legal advice. The study found that a range of economic and social policy imperatives, including public health, tackling homelessness, and child protection, as well as human rights obligations, can require a level of inclusion in services, a need felt most keenly at the local level \( **R2**\). Providing access to services can lead to conflict with national governments but elsewhere controversy is avoided by low visibility provision. While city networks regularly discussed policy relating to legally resident migrants, on which guidance on ‘best practices’ was available, during the research it became apparent that cities had felt unable to discuss this more sensitive issue. They had no opportunity for peer\-to\-peer learning nor access to research evidence. The research provided a safe context in which that dialogue could take place and, identifying a need for ongoing knowledge exchange, led to the establishment of the *City Initiative on Migrants with Irregular Status* \(C\-MISE\). 

1.  The second study \(2013\-2015\), by Spencer and Price, investigated UK local authority practices in relation to destitute migrant children and their families who had irregular immigration status \( **R6**\). It focused on a local authority duty to protect children ‘in need’, including those who, because of their immigration status, have no right to access welfare benefits \(‘No Recourse to Public Funds’\). It found that the complexity of the law, and resistance by some local authorities, meant some destitute families are turned away by staff without their eligibility for accommodation and welfare support being assessed. For those whose eligibility was assessed, ideas on the relative ‘deservingness’ of migrant parents and children with irregular status played a part in decision making and outcomes \( **R3**\). Advice and support from a voluntary organisation was found to increase the chance of a family receiving support, but availability of that expertise was limited in parts of the country; a finding that prompted the researchers’ design of an online diagnostic tool. 

1.  The third study \(2018\-2020\), by Delvino, investigated the ability of irregular migrants to report if they are a victim or witness of crime without risking arrest and deportation, in the USA and Europe \( **R5**\).  It found that there are significant barriers faced by the victims in interacting with police authorities, with negative consequences for crime prevention and detection. Certain legal and policy innovations had been introduced in the USA \(where practice is more advanced\) and in four European countries to address this. The study identified implications for reform at EU, national and local levels.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 *Forming the City Initiative on Migrants with Irregular Status \(C\-MISE\)* 

 The first study, on national and municipal policy responses \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\) led Europe’s network of major cities, Eurocities, to partner with Spencer \(and COMPAS’ knowledge exchange arm, the Global Exchange on Migration and Diversity \(GEM\) which she led\) and Barcelona City Council in the first meeting of European cities to discuss provision of services to irregular migrants \(2014\). That dialogue, and the expectation that the refugee crisis \(2015\-2016\) would lead to a rise in the number of residents with irregular status, led to GEM securing funds to establish \(2017\) the *City Initiative on Migrants with Irregular Status \(C\-MISE*\). Initially a working group of 11 cities in 10 countries, chaired by the City of Utrecht, its aim was to build a stronger body of evidence and share learning on city practices in relation to migrants with irregular immigration status; disseminate guidance on key areas of service provision; and develop a shared, city perspective on relevant reforms in EU policy agendas. 

 Spencer and Delvino have since facilitated a programme of regular two\-day workshops where cities exchange knowledge on city practices, with input from the researchers. The research \( **R1\-R6**\) is reaching a wider audience through a key output, C\-MISE’s 79\-page Guidance for Municipalities \(2019 – **S1**\) which used the research to set out the rationales for service provision \( **R2**\) and practical examples \( **R1**\) of how to address the service needs of irregular migrants, such as their need for shelter, health care and legal advice. An executive summary is translated into 7 languages. It is accompanied by a video documentary \( **S1**\) featuring Deputy Mayors and officials explaining why and how services are provided. These have been circulated to the 47 Member States of the Council of Europe by its Congress of Regional and Local Authorities \(2019\); to the global Cities of Migration network; and to the 140 cities in the Intercultural Cities Network, all of which had formerly focused only on migrants with legal residence. 

 *Changing European cities’ approach to practice & policy regarding irregular migrants* 

 The research evidence \( **R1\-R6**\) and peer\-to\-peer learning in C\-MISE meetings, now directly engaging 44 cities in 17 countries, has led to changes in the practices of the participating cities. The former Chair of Eurocities’ Migration and Integration Working Group \(from Barcelona, **S8**\) says: “ *This seminal work was a turning point’* in how cities approach the issue. The City of Utrecht says “ *The combination of research of Oxford University and the practices and policy of cities across Europe is a huge step forward...That made it possible for us as a city and other major cities in Holland to have a more practical solution oriented approach*.” \( **S2**\) 

 The changes in practice cited here focus on reforms in 8 cities: Athens, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Ghent, Milan, Oslo, Utrecht and Zurich. 

-  Utrecht reports that the research evidence and broad city membership of C\-MISE empowered its negotiators in November 2018 to secure Dutch government agreement and funding to provide a municipal ‘Bed, Bath and Bread’ service to destitute irregular migrants. Utrecht \(estimated irregular migrant population, 3\-4,000\) also introduced a scheme for irregular migrants to be engaged in voluntary work to enhance their well being: “ *The research done the last 9 years by Oxford has helped a lot to reach this point of multi level cooperation so the impact is huge*” \( **S2**\). 

-  Ghent \(estimated irregular migrant population 4,700 of whom a third are children, and over two thirds are settled residents\) has secured approval to set up a Reception and Orientation service providing access to shelter and advice. Legal advice can establish if the individual could secure a right to stay or should return to their country of origin, and the research \( **R1**\) found high success rates for this approach: *“the C\-MISE guidance, derived from COMPAS's extensive research, was invaluable for us in providing examples of good practices abroad  …relating to shelter and related services, which we arê now developing here”* \( **S3**\). Ghent has also agreed a vision statement and strategy for its service provision: *“The evidence and analysis in the research demonstrated the importance of our having clarity on our reasons for service provision and hence contextualising our work within a document of this kind” .* Reporting on C\-MISE at the national level, securing the support of national agencies, helped secure a Federal Government commitment to pilot projects providing advice to irregular migrants on asylum residence and return options \( **S3**\).  The research \( **R1**, **R4**\) and learning from C\-MISE dialogues has been used by Frankfurt  \(estimated migrant population 25,000\-40,000\): the City Council has used it at its health clinic for irregular migrants as the basis for negotiating agreement with the city’s Social Welfare Department to set up a new unit, with a first year budget of EUR10,000, to which patients can be referred for legal advice and signposting to other council services where their eligibility for support will be assessed \( **S4**\). 

-  The research \( **R6**\) had demonstrated the important role of voluntary organisations in providing services for irregular migrants, taken forward as a priority in C\-MISE. 

 Athens \( **S5**\) and Oslo \( **S6**\) established advisory groups of voluntary organisations to provide them with advice on this issue, in each case contributing to a review of the city’s approach. 

-  The research \( **R1**\) also revealed a lack of data on irregular migrants who are not included in an official census. Zurich carried out a study to establish the number and characteristics of irregular migrants in the city \(estimate now confirmed of approximately 10,000 people\). This has provided a basis for reforms including a city identity card that would be available to irregular migrants \(who may have no other form of identification\). It also facilitated provision of financial support to these vulnerable residents during the Covid\-19 crisis. \( **S7\)** 

-  Barcelona \(estimated migrant population 30,000\) credits the research with providing ‘a solid framework’ for its 2017 strategy on irregular migrants, and has since developed, among other reforms, legal counselling for domestic workers, a development “ *definitely pushed by the fact that we are in the C\-MISE project*”\) \( **S8**\). 

-  Milan, attributing the effectiveness of C\-MISE to its ability ‘ *to combine the scientific in\-depth analysis and the learning process of practical solutions*’ consequently decided to strengthen its legal counselling service by locating it within its service for homeless people, the model already effectively used by Utrecht, and decided to open its advice and orientation service to people with irregular status \( **S9**\). 

 The beneficiaries of these reforms are *all* the residents in the municipal areas, through enhancing public health and crime prevention, for instance, not only those with irregular status. 

 *Developing an online diagnostic tool for local authorities in the UK*. 

 The findings of our UK study on destitute migrants \( **R6**\) led us to develop an online diagnostic tool to enable local authorities, advice agencies and migrants to assess eligibility for local authority support, a complex area of law. It “ *enables the individual to consider what steps they must take to improve their situation in the UK, whether this is through gaining employment, through accessing legal advice to regularise their immigration status \- or by making an informed decision to return to their country of origin*” \( **S10**\). Google\-metrics \(Jan 2017 to 3 December 2020\) showed there had then been 39,616 users of the tool; 79% of whom indicated they were at imminent risk of homelessness. In 2017 this tool won a UK Community Integration Award. We have now licensed the tool to the No Recourse to Public Funds network, housed at the London Borough of Islington, to ensure its long\-term sustainability online \( **S10**\). The British Red Cross, which assisted in the development of the tool, says \( **S11**\) the research \( **R6**\): “ *was central to identifying the need to better equip practitioners working in this area, and destitute migrant families themselves…..We use the tool interactively in casework sessions to work through a service user’s situation and demonstrate their eligibility for assistance…sometimes the only route to ensuring vulnerable children’s accommodation and living needs are met*”. 

 *Increasing protection of irregular migrants at national and European level.* 

 Responding to the need to translate the research into specific national contexts, the Association of Italian municipalities, ANCI, has established a working group of Italian municipalities to facilitate implementation of the C\-MISE guidance in Italy. At its first meeting, of 13 cities in December 2020, it decided to conduct a study of the legal opportunities to provide services and local good practices, to draw up proposals to the national government for reform; and identify methods for quantifying irregular migrants at the local level. \( **S9**\) 

 At European level, the evidence on barriers faced by migrant victims of crime \( **R5**\) in accessing safe ways to report crime influenced the content of the recent European Union Strategy on Victims’ Rights 2020\-2025 \( **S12**, footnote 74, citing **R5**\). For the first time it commits the European Commission \(EC\) to explore legislative proposals by 2022 on access to support for irregular migrants who are victims of crime; and urges EU Member States ‘ *to ensure that all victims, including migrant victims have access to justice independently of their residence status*’. An earlier session with the EC’s Directorate\-General Home was instrumental in its decision to set irregular migrants as the topic of the next country report of the European Migration Network, the function of which is to support EU policy making. 

 The Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants \(PICUM\), the highly regarded umbrella body of voluntary organisations across Europe in this field, states C\-MISE is *“making an impact by strengthening the role played by cities on the policy debates on irregular migrants both on the national as well as EU levels*” \( **S13**\). 

 At UN level, our research on access to health \( **R1**, **R4**\) led the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to appoint Delvino to report on the municipal contribution to irregular migrants’ access to healthcare \(2019\), and to host a dialogue between international human rights bodies and local authorities for the first time on this issue. This led to the publication of the first UN report, prepared by Delvino, promoting and recommending local practices for the enjoyment of irregular migrants’ right to health \( **S14**\). The UN office confirmed Delvino’s contribution to this report, stating that his ‘ *desk and field research, as well as his contribution to the drafting of the report, proved very valuable. The networks that* \[he is\] *involved in further proved an asset for the early identification of promising practices by local authorities and civil society*’ \( **S15**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 McAlinden’s research prompted reform of the law relating to grooming in six Australian states and territories. Her research, highlighting the ‘legislative gap’ that exists with respect to the grooming of persons other than a child was cited in support of the recommendations of a major parliamentary inquiry in Victoria, the second most populous state. For the first time anywhere, grooming was criminalised as a ‘stand\-alone’ sexual offence. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse modelled their understanding of grooming on McAlinden’s definition and recommended the enactment of a new grooming offence across Australia. A further five states or territories have introduced legislation to this effect. McAlinden’s research has also informed public and professional discourses at national and international level. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Utilising a range of methodologies \(comparative, doctrinal, theoretical and empirical\), Professor McAlinden has published widely on the dynamics of sexual offending behaviour, including grooming. Through a series of monographs, book chapters and journal articles as well as public presentations and expert testimony, she has directly broadened the political, public and legal understanding of grooming and its role in child sexual abuse. 

 Grooming is generally taken to refer to the preparatory process which precedes child sexual abuse. McAlinden’s article published in 2006 was one of the first academic outputs on this topic **\[R1\]**. The core argument is that in addition to a child as the intended or primary victim, families and parents/carers can also be groomed in order to gain access to a child; and that, as a ‘preparatory behaviour’, this is not currently captured by the criminal law. This article also coined the phrase 'institutional grooming’ to explain how abuse may occur in organisational contexts with respect to protective adults as well as children. 

 McAlinden’s profile as a recognised international authority on grooming has been underpinned by two additional research projects each resulting in a monograph on the topic. The first involved international comparative research on social, policy and legislative responses to grooming in a range of settings **\[R2\]**. This study produced new insights on the role of grooming in the onset and maintenance of child sexual abuse within families and institutions as well as on\-line and the challenges this poses for current regulatory responses. In particular, this research highlighted the limitations of current legal responses to grooming in a range of jurisdictions, including Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, which for the most part recognised grooming in very narrow terms as occurring only in on\-line settings. It argued for the need for law and policy to broaden their understanding of grooming in order to capture the multi\-dimensional nature of grooming behaviour and the ways in which it can occur in a range of contexts including both on\-line and off\-line. 

 This research produced a new and original definition of grooming which better captures the complexity of the process, incorporating, for the first time, all aspects of grooming including on the internet, via families, within institutions and among peers: 

 *\(1\) the use of a variety of manipulative and controlling techniques \(2\) with a vulnerable subject \(3\) in a range of inter\-personal and social settings \(4\) in order to establish trust or normalise sexually harmful behaviour \(5\) with the overall aim of facilitating exploitation and/or prohibiting exposure.* 

 The key aspect of this new definition is that it went beyond previous research by explicitly recognising the twin purposes of grooming in both making abuse possible as well as subsequently keeping it hidden. The empirical research was funded by the British Academy and published as a sole\-authored monograph by Oxford University Press in 2012. 

 The second project explored ‘peer based grooming’ within the context of a broader study on ‘risk’ and harmful and exploitative sexual behaviours among children and young people, drawing on the international literature and empirical research conducted by the author. This project examined the complexities of peer\-to\-peer forms of grooming and how they might operate in institutional contexts, such as schools or care homes, to normalise harmful sexual behaviour and perpetuate abusive practices. The research was funded by the National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers \(NOTA\) – one of the leading international organisations in the field. The resultant sole\-authored monograph was published by Cambridge University Press in 2018 **\[R3\]**. 

 McAlinden has made invited contributions on ‘grooming’ to edited collections comprised of practitioner and academic perspectives **\[R4\]** and to practitioner journals **\[R5\]**. In addition, she has also established research expertise on Australian inquiries into institutional abuse having published an article as lead author with an Australian academic in the *Sydney Law Review* \(2016\),  the leading Australian law journal **\[R6\]**.

","
 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact of McAlinden’s research on grooming has occurred in the following ways: First, it underpinned the recommendations of a parliamentary inquiry and shaped the formulation of a new offence of ‘grooming’ in Victoria, the second most populous state in Australia with a population of 6.49M, including 1.01M children. Subsequently, her research and expert testimony provided to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse resulted in recommendations to extend this ‘grooming offence’ across Australia. Five further states or territories within Australia to date have enacted or amended legislation to this effect, strengthening child protection policies and helping to safeguard a combined child population of 4.26M. McAlinden’s research has also informed public and professional debates on grooming at a national and international level. 

 **Public Inquiry & Recommendations for Law Reform** 

 McAlinden’s earlier \(2006\) research on grooming **\[R1\]** was first cited by a parliamentary inquiry on institutional child abuse in Victoria, Australia \( *Betrayal of Trust*, 2013\), where the Inquiry picked up on McAlinden’s research themselves. 

 McAlinden’s research made a distinct and material contribution to the recommendations of the Victoria Inquiry and the legislation enacted as a result of that Inquiry. Published in November 2013, the Inquiry Report cited the research in recommending the enactment of a new criminal offence of grooming a child, their parents or others with the intention of committing a sexual offence against a child. Within Volume 2, Chapter 22 of the Inquiry Report, ‘The Criminality of Grooming’, McAlinden’s article is cited 3 times in 11 pages **\[Source A below\]**. Beyond witness transcripts and other inquiry reports, there were no other academic texts cited in this part of the Inquiry Report. As McAlinden had recommended, this new offence explicitly recognises that children, as well as their parents, carers or other family members, may be targeted and ‘groomed’ by would\-be ‘sex offenders’, via for example, offenders befriending or commencing relationships with parents as a prelude to sexual abuse. 

 **New Legislation on ‘Grooming’** 

 Recommendations from the Inquiry led to legal and policy reform in Victoria in which ‘grooming’ was redefined for the first time as a substantive sexual offence, rather than simply an aggravating factor **\[Source B below\]**. The new offence of ‘grooming for sexual conduct with a child under 16’ was enacted by the Crimes Amendment \(Grooming\) Act 2014 in Victoria, Australia \(amending the Crimes Amendment Act 1958, section 49M\) **\[Source C below\]**. This now makes it an offence to groom a child under 16 or their parents or carers with a penalty of up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The offence commenced 9 April 2014. The offence provides that a person \(A\) commits an offence if – 

 a. A is 18 years of age or more; and 

 b. A communicates, by words or conduct \(whether or not a response is made to the communication\), with – 

 i. another person \(B\) who is a child under the age of 16 years; *or* 

 *ii.  another person under whose care, supervision or authority B is* \[emphasis added\]; and 

 c. A intends that the communication facilitate B engaging or being involved in the commission of a sexual offence by A or by another person who is 18 years of age or more 

 This offence, as recommended by the Inquiry based on McAlinden’s research, explicitly recognises the broader scope of grooming – i.e. that grooming often occurs off\-line where parents, carers or those responsible for a child can also be groomed – is the first offence of its kind in the world.  Other countries, including previously parts of Australia, have criminalised grooming in much narrower terms by, for example, confining this offence to electronic/on\-line forms of grooming or communication with a child only \(see e.g. UK, Republic of Ireland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, USA\) **\[Source D below\]**. 

 Further, the Victim’s Charter Act 2006 in Victoria, Australia, was also amended in April 2014 to expressly provide that a child and family members as victims of this grooming offence are entitled to provide a victim impact statement to a court **\[Source C below\]**. 

 This new offence has been incorporated within the Education and Training on Child Protection for the 2,263 schools and colleges across Victoria, benefitting 1.01million children **\[Source B below\]**. According to internal figures from the Crimes Statistics Agency in Victoria, a total of 772 counts of the offence were recorded by Victoria police over the approximate six\-year period since enactment \(April 2014\-June 2020\) **\[Source E below\]**. In addition, there have been a number of prosecutions, including a Supreme Court of Victoria decision, where off\-line forms of ‘grooming’, traditionally thought of as a pre\-abuse behaviour, have been recognised as even more significant than other substantive sexual offences in sentencing decisions **\[Source C below\]**. 

 **Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse** 

 A Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was established, extending to the whole of Australia \(2013\-2017\). McAlinden’s research and testimony directly informed the work and recommendations of the Royal Commission leading to changes in the law.  Her initial involvement is perhaps best summarised by the Chairperson: 

 *We became aware of her research through our work for the Royal Commission … On the basis of Professor McAlinden’s international reputation on “grooming and entrapment” the Royal Commission invited her to provide critical feedback in June 2016 on a draft of our research report on “Grooming and Abuse in Institutional Contexts.” Her feedback was very helpful to the Royal Commission in highlighting several key gaps in current knowledge and understanding of grooming* **\[Source F below\]**. 

 In providing this critical review for the Royal Commission, McAlinden identified several specific ‘gaps’ in current academic and policy discourses on grooming stemming from her own research – e.g. the need for a clear and comprehensive definition of ‘grooming’; the significance of the notions of ‘peer\-grooming’, grooming within institutions \(‘institutional grooming’\). She also submitted two further publications on grooming to the Commission’s research team **\[R1\]** and **\[R2\]**. 

 The Commission’s Research Report published in February 2017, which supported the hearings and final recommendations of the Commission, cites \[R1\] and \[R2\] extensively \(39 times over 29 pages\). In particular, the report utilised McAlinden’s definition of grooming, cited her research with respect to the grooming of significant others to facilitate abuse, and included a specific section on ‘institutional grooming’ based on McAlinden’s research and coining of that term **\[Source G below\]**. 

 McAlinden was subsequently invited as an international expert in March 2017 by the Royal Commission, giving written and oral evidence on ‘grooming and entrapment.’ She also provided written responses to key questions \(9 pp\) for use by the Commission lawyers in advance of the testimony. The Commission’s report and recommendations were published in December 2017. 

 This final report quoted extensively from the transcript of McAlinden’s evidence **\[Source H below\]** and again cited her published research multiple times to support its findings. Across the 17\-volume report **\[Source I below\]**, her research/testimony is cited 78 times – the 2006 article is cited 8 times, the 2012 book 51 times, and the transcript of oral evidence 18 times with a further reference to a co\-authored article **\[R5\]**. 

 McAlinden’s research and testimony emerged as being pivotal to the Commission’s understanding, findings and recommendations in relation to grooming and its role in child sexual abuse. The Chairperson of the Royal Commission further commented: 

 *Professor McAlinden’s evidence and her research was highly influential in shaping our understanding of the scope and complexities of grooming … the Commission based its definition of grooming on that outlined in her 2012 book …. Her research and evidence directly informed our recommendations 25 and 26 which advocated for the enactment of a broad ‘grooming offence’ … throughout Australia to capture any communication or conduct with a child \(recommendation 25\) and the grooming of persons other than the child \(recommendation 26\)* **\[Source F below\]**. 

 The Australian government has since amended Commonwealth \(federal\) legislation to give effect to these recommendations specifically enacting a new offence of the grooming of third parties in order to engage in sexual activity with a child outside Australia, via section 6 of the Crimes Legislation Amendment \(Sexual Crimes Against Children\) and Community Protection Measures Act 2020 **\[Source J below\]**. As of December 2020, five other states or territories have introduced or amended legislation to give effect to the Royal Commission’s recommendations as related to a new grooming offence \(Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland\) and in the remaining two \(Western Australia and the Northern Territory\) these recommendations have been accepted in principle or are under consideration **\[Source J below\]**. 

 **Contribution to Public Debates on ‘Grooming’** 

 As an acknowledged expert, McAlinden has had significant reach in contributing to public and professional debates on ‘grooming’ nationally and internationally. This has included invited professional publications for a special issue of *Probation Journal* **\[R5\]**, a broad range of keynote addresses and extensive media coverage and interviews. McAlinden gave the keynote addresses on ‘Grooming’ and ‘Peer Abuse’ at the NOTA Conference in September 2015 and 2019, one of the leading academic/practitioner international conferences in the field, attended annually by around 300 delegates from all over the world including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA. She has been interviewed and cited as an authority on grooming and institutional abuse in national and international print and broadcast media: see eg *RTE Six One and Nine O’Clock* News \(10/3/17\) & *The Irish Examiner* \(12/3/17\) \(Ireland\); *Pacific Daily News/USA Today* \(11/10/2017\) \(USA\); *The Nation* \(New Zealand\) \(22/09/2017\); and *The Sydney Morning Herald* \(29/03/2017\) & *ABC Radio* ‘The World Today’ \(Australia\) \(27/03/2017\) both of which published/played excerpts from her Royal Commission testimony **\[Source K below\]**. She was profiled in *the Times Higher Education* as a ‘world leading academic’ \(February, 2018\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Regular physical activity is recommended for people with type 1 diabetes \(T1D\), but the resulting blood glucose disruptions can make exercise potentially dangerous. Research at Swansea University has demonstrated how these disruptions can be mitigated by adjusting carbohydrate intake and the dose, type and timing of insulin analogues before, during and after exercise. Our research has \(i\) significantly improved international clinical guidelines, recommendations, and consensus statements for safe physical activity in people with T1D, \(ii\) underpinned a multi\-million\-dollar international educational initiative endorsed by a global diabetes charity that has educated over 5,000 diabetes clinicians and patients to date, \(iii\) empowered a Union Cycliste Internationale \(UCI\)\-accredited professional cycling team with T1D to maximise their performance on the world's stage, and \(iv\) created global economic and commercial impact by providing evidence that allowed an international nutrition company to gain global market access for the inclusion of low\-glycaemic carbohydrates in food and drink beverages for safe consumption by exercising individuals with T1D. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background and Context of Research:** The incidence of T1D in Europe ranges between 7.9 and 32.8 cases per 100,000 people \(EURODIAB Consortium\), and is rising; furthermore, there is strong evidence of earlier mortality in those with than in those without T1D. Regular physical activity comprising muscle strength and cardiovascular endurance is recommended by international charities and governmental guidelines to promote good health in people with T1D and close this mortality gap. However, acute exercise increases the risk of blood glucose disturbances \(i.e., hypo\- and hyper\-glycaemia\) that are dangerous in the short\-term and contribute to reduced motivation to exercise and quality and length of life in the long\-term, when poorly managed. Thus, safe participation in physical activity is a significant barrier for people with T1D. 

 High\-quality clinical trials conducted by Dr Bracken between 2011 and 2016 established effective strategies to maintain blood glucose concentrations in people with T1D through adjustments in insulin analogue use and carbohydrate intake, in the context of \(i\) resistance and \(ii\) aerobic exercise. These research findings provide robust evidence where previous data were weak or non\-existent. Importantly, these strategies are relevant to diabetes healthcare professionals and individuals with T1D and allow safe participation in regular recreational \(health benefit\) and competitive \(elite performance\) exercises. 

 **Detailed Overview of Research:** Our research has detailed the gluco\-regulatory responses to \(i\) resistance and \(ii\) aerobic exercise in those with T1D and created insulin analogue and carbohydrate interventions to minimise blood glucose disruption specific to each exercise type. 

 *i\) Resistance exercise:* Chronic hyperglycaemia predisposes people with T1D to earlier onset and progression of cardiovascular disease and mortality than those without T1D, and physical activity that incorporates strengthening exercises is recommended by global diabetes charities and organisations to improve long\-term glycaemic control. However, resistance exercise can acutely raise blood glucose, and this might seem counterintuitive for people with T1D. Our clinical research thoroughly characterised the metabolic impacts of acute resistance exercise on blood glucose in T1D **\[R1\]** and provided a mechanistic explanation for the development of resistance exercise\-induced hyperglycaemia. We sought to minimise strength exercise\-induced hyperglycaemia by reducing exercise intensity to be achievable by patients with low exercise capacity while attaining international physical activity guideline exercise volume **\[R2\]**. As resistance exercise\-induced hyperglycaemia was evident even with low exercise intensities, we created a clinically important individualized patient algorithm for immediate post\-exercise administration with modern insulin analogues and demonstrated how this strategy countered the blood glucose rise following resistance exercise in patients with T1D **\[R3\]**. 

 *ii\) Aerobic exercise:* Though regular endurance activities have been shown to improve long long\-term glycaemic control in T1D, by contrast, acute aerobic exercise causes a reduction in blood glucose and increases the potential for hypoglycaemia. Indeed, exercise\-induced hypoglycaemia can occur at night, when it can be life threatening. Our clinical trials demonstrated the importance of carefully manipulating the administration of short and long\-lasting insulin analogue \(and its timing\) and the ingestion of low\-glycaemic index carbohydrates, to improve glycaemia around aerobic exercise and crucially, to dramatically reduce overnight hypoglycaemia **\[R4 & R5\]**. Finally, we showed how large insulin analogue reductions around exercise do not exacerbate the development of clinically serious ketoacidosis **\[R5 & R6\].**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The pathways to impact have arisen through Dr Bracken’s esteem within the field of diabetes related research. Dr Bracken’s sustained contribution of high\-quality clinical trials that provide real world solutions for diabetes patients, resulted in a range of partnerships spanning healthcare, elite sport and industry which have subsequently created impacts with global reach. 

 **Improved International Diabetes Clinical Practice Guidelines, Recommendations and Consensus Statements** 

 Dr. Bracken’s research has been used to support clinical practice guidelines, recommendations and consensus statements published by leading International diabetes organisations including Diabetes Canada, International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes \(ISPAD\), American Diabetes Association, and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation \(JDRF\) **\[Table 1\]**. These guidelines and recommendations have global reach because they also appear in high\-quality international journals \(e.g., Diabetes Care and Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology\) and their impact is significant because they serve as a primary reference point and evidence base for diabetes clinicians and healthcare professionals working with and advising T1D patients. An illustration of these wider impacts on clinical practice and patient outcomes is highlighted by a quote from the head of one diabetes outpatient clinic in Europe **\[C1\]**: 

 “*Overall, we find outpatients are benefitting from the implementation of insulin alteration strategies for both strength and endurance exercises and are encouraged to see the improvement in motivation in patients in their continuation of regular physical activity. His* \[Dr Bracken’s\] *principles, borne out of clinical research studies, improve our daily practice and contribute to better outcomes for patients*”.

 **Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation \(JDRF\) Peak Performance Programme**: 

 Dr Bracken’s research contributed to the development of the world’s first T1D physical activity educational programme, ‘JDRF Peak Performance’, a USD5,000,000 funded project, that created and delivered a curriculum globally to address a significant knowledge gap in the T1D healthcare community \(endorsed in the UK by the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists\). Dr. Bracken was invited to contribute to the development and delivery of the programme across the US, Canada, Australia and Europe, and his research *“provided the key underpinning evidence for a large portion of the programme content”* **\[C2\]**. This programme aimed to provide research\-based information to diabetes clinicians, T1D patients and carers about the principles of good glucose management around exercise. Since its launch in 2017, JDRF Peak has educated and improved the knowledge of over 5,000 such workshop participants \[ **C2\-5**\] and has reached many more since being made available online. In 243 responses from a survey of clinicians at one workshop site, 100% reported that the course had enhanced their knowledge, 96% said it would allow them to implement new information and skills in their practice, and approximately 50% reported that it would either directly enhance patient outcomes or allow the creation/revision of protocols, policies and procedures in their organisation **\[C4\-5\]**. US and European patients reported that the course was useful and relevant \(95% strongly agree/agree\), helped them better understand the factors influencing glucose control \(89% strongly agree/agree\) and helped them to improve judgement around exercise \(94% strongly agree/agree\) **\[C4\-5\]**. 

 **Changing practice to maximise performance in professional cyclists with T1D:** 

 Our research has also been used in elite cycling to inform and change sport science support and rider practices of Team Novo Nordisk, the world’s first and only UCI\-accredited professional cycling team comprised entirely of riders with T1D. Their mission statement is to ‘ *inspire, educate and empower those affected by diabetes’*. Following an invite to form a global research group of international diabetes and exercise experts, Dr Bracken and his team worked with this cycling team to impart knowledge of effective strategies that mitigate risk of exercise\-induced dysglycaemia, evidenced by Dr Bracken’s research **\[R1\-6\]**. Recent published observational studies reveal the excellent glycaemia during team training and competition day that improve and empower them to maximise their performance **\[C6\].** Excerpts from a letter by Team Novo Nordisk Head of Performance demonstrates the significance of this impact **\[C7\]**: 

 “*This research has resulted in a change in the practices of our team of Sport Science staff at Team Novo Nordisk…it has allowed us to apply clear and effective advice to each of our athletes about adjustments in insulin dose/timing to 1\) ensure good glycaemic regulation, and 2\) optimise performance during training and competition.”* 

 *“Dr Brackens research has had important significance and impact….it has improved daily practices behind glucose management and riders’ performance, increasing awareness on the association between glucose control and performance, and detailing more the strategies that each of our athletes need to perform at their very best. 2019 has been the most successful year in UCI rankings for Team Novo Nordisk.”* 

 **Supporting global market access for low glycaemic index carbohydrates:** 

 Beneo, a global sugar company, manufactures Palatinose<sup>TM</sup>, a carbohydrate with a low blood glycaemic response. In our research, feeding Palatinose™ before exercise improved glycaemia, protected against hypoglycaemia and maintained run performance in patients with T1D. In addition, a Palatinose™\-containing meal and bedtime snack improved night\-time glycaemic control and reduced the risk of hypoglycaemic episodes **\[R4\]**. These findings were used as *“key supporting evidence”* **\[C8\]** for a white paper on Palatinose<sup>TM</sup> published in 2017 \[ **\[C9\]:** page 9\] that was commercially beneficial and 

 *“allowed us* \[Beneo\] *to achieve approval for the use of isomaltulose \(Palatinose<sup>TM</sup>\) as a functional carbohydrate from various regulatory bodies worldwide, including major markets like the US the European Union and its 27 Member States, Australia/New Zealand, Canada, Brazil and Argentina, or the confirmation of its food status in over 20 further countries worldwide. The impact of this for our business has been significant because it has allowed us to target Palatinose<sup>TM</sup> into new products and markets”* **\[C9\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research undertaken within the University of Sheffield has directly resulted in halting/no\-adoption of diaphragm pacing \(DPS\) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \(ALS\) in the UK, Europe, and Canada, and has prevented DPS becoming an accepted treatment for ALS patients with respiratory insufficiency. The DIPALS trial \(led by Sheffield\) concluded that the addition of DPS to standard care with non\-invasive ventilation \(NIV\) was associated with decreased survival in patients with ALS. The Sheffield team were pivotal in shaping clinical policy on the use of DPS in ALS patients which has prevented harm to patients worldwide and reduced costs to the NHS. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \(ALS\), named motor neurone disease \(MND\) in the UK, is a devastating illness that leads to muscle weakness and death, usually within 2\-3 years of symptom onset. Respiratory insufficiency is a common cause of morbidity, particularly in later stages, and respiratory complications are the leading cause of mortality in ALS/MND patients. Non\-invasive ventilation \(NIV\) is the current standard therapy to manage respiratory insufficiency. Some patients do not tolerate NIV due to a number of issues including mask interface problems and claustrophobia. In those that do tolerate NIV, eventually respiratory muscle weakness will progress to a point where NIV is ineffective. 

 The NeuRx RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing System \(DPS\) was originally developed for patients with respiratory insufficiency and diaphragm paralysis secondary to stable high spinal cord injuries. In 2011, it was given Humanitarian Device Exemption \(HDE\) by the United States Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) for use in ALS/MND. HDE is an approval allowing a medical device to be marketed without requiring evidence of effectiveness. In 2011 the NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme funded the DIPALS study \(ISRCTN 53817913\), led by Professor McDermott and implemented by Sheffield researchers with collaborators at seven specialist ALS/MND and respiratory centres in the UK. It was worldwide, the first multicentre, open\-label, randomised controlled trial \(RCT\) designed to determine the safety and efficacy of diaphragm pacing with this system in 108 patients with respiratory muscle weakness due to ALS/MND \[R1\]. The primary outcome measure was overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. Analysis was by intention to treat \[R1\]. 

 The DIPALS trial recruited 74 participants diagnosed with ALS/MND that fulfilled the eligibility criteria. They were randomly assigned to receive either NIV alone \(n=37\) or NIV plus DPS \(n=37\). The Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee \(DMEC\) recommended suspension of recruitment in December 2013. The participants continued as per the study protocol until June 2014, when the DMEC advised discontinuation of DPS in all patients on safety grounds. Follow\-up assessments continued until the planned end of the study in December 2014. 

 Survival was significantly shorter in the NIV plus DPS group than in the NIV alone group median 11.0 months vs 22.5 months \(Fig. 1\). Twenty\-eight \(76%\) patients died in the DPS group and 19 \(51%\) patients died in the NIV alone group. One hundred and sixty\-two adverse events \(5.9 events per person\-year\) were recorded in the DPS group, of which 46 events were serious, compared with 81 events \(2·5 events per person\-year\) in the NIV alone group, of which 31 events were serious. Thus, there were twice as many adverse events in the DPS group than in the NIV alone group \[Fig. 1, R2, R3\]. 



 *Figure 1: Overall survival of patients in DIPALS trial* 

 The conclusions of DIPALS are that addition of DPS to standard care with NIV was associated with decreased survival in patients with ALS/MND, demonstrating that DPS should not be used as a routine treatment for patients with ALS/MND in respiratory failure. 

 The research was subsequently replicated in a second multicentre, triple\-blind RCT in patients with probable or definite ALS/MND in 12 ALS/MND centres in France, RespiStimALS \[R2, R3\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Impacts include: health and welfare, public policy and services, practitioners and services. 

 Main beneficiaries include: ALS/MND patients, practitioners, NHS, and NICE. 

 Beneficence and non\-maleficence are fundamental medical ethical principles. This impact case study highlights the importance of the rigorous safety and regulatory requirements in the UK in upholding these principles. If DPS had been implemented based on FDA approval in the US, it is likely that significant harm would have been caused in a vulnerable patient group where there are limited/no treatment options available. Proving robust evidence of the harm has not only removed the risk of harm, it has also saved the NHS significant funds. 

 Preventing harm to ALS/MND patients 

 The initial impact of the DIPALS study is on the life of ALS/MND patients participating in DPS trials worldwide by ensuring they were not adversely affected by DPS; this is evidenced by the early termination of the Sheffield DIPALS trial and the RespiStimALS trial in France \[S1\], and the suspension of recruitment of the further 122 participants in the NEALS study in the US \[S2\]. This has led to the safeguarding of all ALS/MND patients worldwide from possible harm caused by DPS treatment. Approximately 82% of ALS/MND deaths are attributable to respiratory failure. Given that respiratory muscle weakness in ALS/MND will progress eventually to a point where even tolerated intermittent/overnight NIV is ineffective. It is highly plausible that DPS would have become standard care, as an upper estimate, to the 82% of patients with late\-stage ALS/MND. Accordingly, the DIPALS trial protected approximately 80\-100,000 patients worldwide at the time of the trial from harm. Furthermore, with an incidence rate of ALS/MND of approximately 2 per 100,000 people, the DIPALS study continues to prevent harm to over 5,000 newly diagnosed ALS/MND cases year on year. 

 Impact on UK guidelines 

 In 2011, the NeuRx 4/4 DPS received HDE approval from the FDA for use in ALS/MND on the basis of one non\-randomised study which compared patients treated with DPS with published historical data for NIV as the control. However, the data from the NeuRx 4/4 DPS trial on which the FDA based their decision was not published, and this was questioned in a cautionary commentary that urged for further RCTs. At the time of the DIPALS trial, the FDA HDE approval on humanitarian grounds was wrongly seen as a proxy for high\-quality evidence. As a result, many centres worldwide, including in the UK, were proceeding to offer pacing to ALS/MND patients, despite a lack of robust, independent, high\-quality evidence from RCTs to support its use. 

 In the UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) approval had not been received, restricting the access for ALS/MND patients with respiratory difficulties to DPS. The DIPALS trial, motivated by the lack of RCTs into use of DPS in ALS/MND, was required in order for NICE to decide on whether to recommend DPS or not. Following the full analysis and reporting of the DIPALS results, the NICE interventional procedures programme published its recommendations on DPS, quoting the DIPALS study. The NICE recommendation followed the conclusions of the DIPALS study and states “ *Current evidence on intramuscular diaphragm stimulation for ventilator\-dependent chronic respiratory failure caused by motor neurone disease suggests that there are serious long\-term safety concerns. Evidence on efficacy is limited and therefore, this procedure should not be used to treat this condition*” \[S3\]. It is highly likely that if the DIPALS trial had not been conducted that the use of DPS would have grown to the point it was accepted as standard care, and that within a few years it would have been seen as unethical to conduct the DIPALS study. 

 The Motor Neurone Disease Association \(MNDA\), the only national ALS/MND charity in the UK and the founding member of the International Alliance of ALS/MND associations \(which has 40 member organisations in 34 countries\), does not recommend the use of DPS for their members. In their response to the interim report of a UK government initiative designed to enable patients to get quicker access to innovative new diagnostic tools, treatments, and medical technologies, they used the results of the DIPALS trials as a case study to support the position that “ *while treatments remain experimental and unproven, we do not support making them routinely available. Such treatments should be made available to patients only via rigorous methodologies in order to make sure that they can be safely used in the wider patient population*” \[MNDA Policy Manager, S4\]. 

 Impact on clinical practice and guidelines in other European countries 

 The DIPALS study results informed a Europe\-wide halt/no\-adoption of DPS in ALS/MND. The European Respiratory Society published a clinical signpost concluding that “ *Diaphragm pacing should not be offered to any patient with ALS/MND*”, and the German National Guideline for Treating Chronic Respiratory Failure states “ *This approach \[DPS\] is associated with shortened survival \[in ALS/MND\] and is therefore obsolete*” \[S5\]. 

 In 2019, The University of Sheffield surveyed all non\-UK members of the European Network for the Cure of ALS \(ENCALS\), which includes 54 centres covering 24 countries, by questionnaire. Questions covered guidelines and policy related to use of DPS in ALS/MND and any changes due to recommendations from the DiPALS trial. There were 20 respondents from 12 countries. Six centres from Slovenia, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Spain, and France stated definitely that the recommendations from the studies had affected their use of diaphragm pacing in ALS/MND. Fourteen centres \(70% of respondents\) replied ""completely no use"" to the question ""How have the recommendations of the Diaphragm Pacing studies affected your clinical practice regarding the application of DPS in patients with ALS?"" Free text responses included “ *Never implemented because of the published results*” and “ *We were only preparing to start diaphragm pacing when the results were published. We just decided not to go further with this therapy*” \[S6\]. 

 Impact on clinical practice and guidelines in North America 

 Based on the DIPALS study, The Canadian Thoracic Society clinical practice guidelines concluded: “We do not recommend diaphragm pacing in patients with ALS/MND” \[S7\]. In the US, the halting of the DIPALS trial and subsequent publication of results coincides with a sharp decline in implantation of pacing devices in ALS/MND patients \[Fig 2, S8\]. 



 *Fig 2: Use of DPS in the US. Data on DPS in the US obtained from the IBM® MarketScan® Research Databases* 

 Impact on health economics 

 By preventing DPS from becoming standard care, the Sheffield research caused significant savings to health care providers worldwide. As an indication of the scale of savings, using the UK as example, in 2014 the cost of the devices and operation within the NHS was calculated as £18,000/patient compared to the annual cost of NIV of £3,600/patient \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

  

 Clement Imbert and co\-investigators developed and tested applications of nudge theory that are being used by the Belgian Tax Authority to influence changes in taxpayer behaviour. The research has led to permanent changes in the way the tax authority communicates with personal income taxpayers, enabling them to increase tax compliance and make significant cost savings on enforcement measures. Following the success of the intervention, a formal unit within the tax authority has been established to study and apply behavioural insights across other areas of tax collection. Policymakers in Belgium and other European countries are now trialling and implementing behavioural nudges more widely, drawing on findings from the research.

 The study of determinants of individual behaviour that go beyond those stressed by standard theories of rational choice has become a prominent area in economics in recent years. One dimension of this research that has received a lot of attention from policymakers is 'nudging'. Nudges are used to influence individuals to take a desired action and can offer low\-cost solutions to societal challenges. They often involve subtle changes to language or the use of imagery to prompt action. Research conducted by Dr Clement Imbert, with colleagues at the University of Oxford and London School of Economics, explored how the use of nudges in communication with taxpayers affects their compliance and improves the effectiveness of the tax collection process. The project builds on Imbert's background in conducting field experiments, in collaboration with policymakers that have aimed to improve the effectiveness of public services in India and France. 

 Tax authorities devote considerable resources to the collection of taxes. Closing the 'tax gap' – with the potential of recouping millions in missing tax revenue – is a key objective for governments. It is also important that taxes are paid on time so that funds are available for public services, especially in times of austerity. Chasing overdue payments creates significant additional administrative and financial burden for authorities. 

 Effective tax collection requires robust understanding of the drivers of tax compliance and the cost\-effectiveness of interventions to improve compliance. Imbert and colleagues carried out four population\-wide natural field experiments with the Belgian tax authority over the course of three fiscal years \(2014\-2016\). They tested how a series of sixteen different types of nudges in letters sent to taxpayers affected compliance throughout the tax process, across the entire population subject to self\-assessment personal income tax in Belgium. 

 The tax authority writes to personal income taxpayers to request them to file a tax return and 

 again to request payment of taxes. Follow\-up correspondence is sent if taxpayers are late in filing their tax return or late in paying taxes. The team applied nudges to correspondence sent at each of these four stages of the tax collection process including in the 'Tax on Web' system, an online interface through which people can file taxes. 

 They tested the effect of simplifying correspondence by shortening letters, reducing information overload, and highlighting action\-relevant information using colour or boxes. For a subset of taxpayers, they tested the effect of adding 'deterrence' messages to simplified letters that make explicit the financial penalties of not paying and/or highlight enforcement actions that will be taken. Lastly, they tested 'tax morale' messages that highlight the public value of taxes and/or the social norms attached to paying taxes. 

 Key findings \[ **3.1**\] include: 

 • Simplifying communication consistently and substantially increases tax compliance. Simplification makes more people pay taxes on time and makes both late filers and late payers comply more swiftly than they otherwise would. 

 • Simplified tax filing reminders increased subsequent filing by 8% compared to the standard reminder. 

 • For late taxpayers, receiving a simplified payment reminder increased the probability of tax payment by as much as 23% in the subsequent 14 days, compared to the standard reminder. After 6 months, the effect equated to nearly EUR 4,000,000 additional revenue \(EUR 3,160,000 extra in taxes plus enforcement cost savings of EUR 700,000.\) 

 • Reducing information overload and emphasising action\-relevant information are particularly effective in increasing compliance. 

 • Including deterrence messages in simplified letters has an additional positive effect. 

 • Communication that includes 'tax morale' messages is not effective – and sometimes even backfires. 

 • Taxpayers who receive simplified communication one year continue to be more compliant the following year. 

 • Regardless of the method of cost\-benefit analysis used, simplified communication is far more cost\-effective than standard enforcement measures \(e.g., bailiffs\). 

 The research was initiated through De Neve and Spinnewijn, who had connections with the Belgian tax authority. Imbert, De Neve and Spinnewijn designed and conducted the trial in consultation with Maarten Luts, Nudging & Tax Compliance Project Manager at the tax authority. Imbert analysed and drew conclusions from the data, designed the cost\-benefit analysis, and led on writing the paper, with the support of Tsankova, a Warwick PhD student.

 <ins> **Improving tax compliance in Belgium**</ins> 

 The research was conducted in collaboration with the General Administration of Collection and Debt Recovery within the Belgian Finance Ministry \(Federal Public Service \(FPS\) Finances\). Throughout the course of the experiments, the team had regular meetings with senior government officials, including the President of FPS Finance, the Administrator\-General for Collection and Debt Recovery and the Administrator\-General for Taxation for Individuals. 

 Following the research, FPS Finance has now permanently adopted simplified communication to taxpayers, using the same simplification techniques tested in the experiments, as well as a deterrence message highlighting the penalties for not paying. \[ **5.1**\] 

 Simplified letters with deterrence messages are sent to all individuals subject to completing a personal income tax return in Belgium \(approximately 2,000,000 people annually\), throughout the tax process. This includes letters sent to taxpayers to request them to file a return and again to request payment of taxes, as well as reminders where submissions or payments are late. \[ **5.1**\] Letters are sent in all the main languages spoken in Belgium: French, German and Flemish. 

 The new approach to tax collection has had a significant ongoing effect on compliance, both in terms of revenue gained and timeliness of payments. It has also led to substantial cost\-savings by reducing the need for traditional enforcement methods. Replying to a Parliamentary question about the results of the trial, the Belgian Finance Minister at the time, Johan Van Overtveldt \[ **5.2**\], confirmed that: 

-  EUR 4,000,000 additional revenue was collected in 2015 and EUR 3,000,000 in 2016. 

-  EUR 30,000,000 was collected more quickly in 2015 \(compared to previous years when simplified letters were not used\), and EUR 25,000,000 in 2016. 

-  EUR 1,000,000 was saved in enforcement costs in 2015, and EUR 1,400,000 was saved in 2016. \(This compares to EUR 79,550 for the one\-off cost of the simplification intervention.\) 

 The Minister also confirmed that, following the success of the intervention, the use of behavioural insights has been included as an objective in FPS Finance's governance agreement, and a formal unit within the tax authority has been established to study and apply behavioural insights throughout the tax process. \[ **5.2**\] 

 Referring to the research, he said: ""The undeniable positive results of the various experiments that the Federal Public Service \(FPS\) Finance has carried out in recent years clearly demonstrate the added value of the use of behavioural theories. Small, low\-cost interventions can have a big impact on the behaviour of those liable for payment and reporting...The current and future Governance Agreement with FPS Finance refers to the importance of applying nudging and behavioural insights to incentivise taxpayers to fulfil their tax obligations. In this context, a new unit is currently being set up within the General Administration of Collection and Recovery that will specifically deal with Tax Compliance and the role behavioural insights can play in this."" \[ **5.2**, translation from French\] 

 The 'Tax Compliance and Behavioural Insights' unit was established November 2018 and is led by Maarten Luts. It initiates and oversees the use of behaviour nudging methods to enhance the effectiveness and cost\-efficiency of all policies targeting tax compliance. For example, all letters sent to debtors are now reviewed in the context of the nudge messages trialled in the research. This includes VAT payment reminders, communication about split payment plans and reminder letters to pay penal fines. \[ **5.1**\] 

 <ins> **Influencing wider applications of nudging in policymaking**</ins> 

 As the only behavioural insights unit within the federal administration, the Tax Compliance and Behavioural Insights unit acts as a centre of expertise for other administrations within FPS Finance and more widely across federal ministries and regional governments in Belgium. Maarten Luts and colleagues have met directly to share learning from the research with representatives from the ministry for social security, ministry for labour, ministry for policy and support, and the Federal Agency for Administrative Simplification. They have also provided advice to the country's 3 regional governments \(Wallonia, Brussels and Flanders\) and the City of Antwerp. \[ **5.1**\] 

 Following the success of the intervention, the federal government is considering how nudge theory can be used more widely in policy. The research was cited in a proposal to apply insights from behavioural science to the Belgian healthcare sector, which was adopted by the Chamber of Representatives in July 2018. The proposal mandates that the federal government test nudges within selected policy areas in the health sector, implement them if successful, and establish a Belgian centre of expertise in behavioural science. \[ **5.3**\] 

 The research was also cited in an approved proposal to apply behavioural insights widely across Flemish regional policy. It commits the Flemish government to developing a framework for the application of behavioural sciences in policy, trialling behavioural science initiatives in selected policies annually and setting up a Flemish Behavioural Sciences expert team, which has since been established. \[ **5.4**\] 

 The impact of the research has extended to other countries, in Europe and beyond, that are using learning from the research to inform behavioural interventions in tax compliance activities. Luts has presented the research to authorities in Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Macedonia, Serbia and Mali. The tax administration of the Czech Republic is starting behavioural trials to improve compliance, and Luts is one of the experts advising them throughout the process. The trials are testing the simplification nudges and the deterrence and social norm messages from the Belgian experiments and following the same design. \[ **5.1**\] 

 The project has been featured in briefing documents that highlight best practice in the use of behavioural insights in policy, including from the European Commission Joint Research Centre \(JRC\) \[ **5.5**\] and the Intra\-European Organisation of Tax Administrators \(IOTA\). \[ **5.6**\] The JRC is coordinating a cross\-national experiment with several European tax administrations to test the use of nudge messages in tax collection, including the deterrence message nudge tested in the trial. Luts and his team are closely involved in this project, with Belgium providing a leading example of the effective use of nudging. The findings are due to be presented at a conference organised by the European Commission and the OECD Forum on Tax Administration. \[ **5.1**\] 

 The research was also presented to 27 different countries at the OECD and IOTA conference hosted by Belgium in April 2017. After the conference, Belgium recommended that the OECD form a Community of Interest on Behavioural Insights. This was launched in late 2017 and shares best practice in applying behavioural insights to improve public policy worldwide. Belgium also leads the Tax Debt Management Network within the OECD and has promoted Behavioural Insights on the Network's agenda. \[ **5.1**\]

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Sykes’s research underpinned the decision by the Catholic Diocese of Cairns, Australia, to establish a drop\-in centre in 2015 in this seaport city, which is a hub for large multi\- residential Papua New Guinean \(PNG\) households. Sykes described how households comprise a mutually dependent network spread across Australian and Papua New Guinean towns and villages, including cities in southeast Asia. Members move easily between several dwellings over the course of a year, but become vulnerable upon leaving their network. 

 A proposal by priest **\[Text removed for publication\]** to the Diocese used Sykes’s data to advise that a centrally\-located shopping mall near his church could be the location for a family centre to meet social needs, enhance wellbeing, and build the PNG community by linking together numerous household networks. The resultant Papua New Guinean Catholic Centre \(PNGCC\) is addressing these fundamental goals by providing members of PNG households with an essential point of contact for meeting and message\-carrying. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Sykes carried out ESRC\-funded ethnographic research into Papua New Guinean households in Far North Queensland \(FNQ\) and North Queensland \(NQ\) \[1\]. The research was undertaken January–December 2012 and October–December 2014, in the wake of a moral panic about the flood of Papua New Guinean economic migrants into Queensland. The study allowed her and her two local PNG research assistants to better assess the distribution and the habits of residence and association of Papua New Guineans in Queensland state. The study clarified confusing 2011 census data, which recorded 25,000 PNG\-born residents in Australia, of which 15,000 resided in Queensland, with many of these in the FNQ and NQ regions of the State. The census did not yield more exact region\-level figures and warned against making inferences from the published data. Sykes and her RAs found that the census office cautioned wisely. Despite the census data for numbers of Papua New Guineans in Queensland, accurate figures are hard to determine by conventional census methods. Sykes’s ethnographic moral economy approach showed that the population of a large network of PNG people in FNQ and NQ might swell from 5000 to 8000, were all the transnational household members to be present in those two regions during one month, and not in residences they possess in PNG, southern Queensland, other Australian States, or Manila, Singapore and New Zealand. 

 Sykes’s research \[2\] discusses the failure of the conceptual apparatus of standard political economy approaches to accurately identify the number of Papua New Guineans living in Australia. The 2011 census data recorded PNG ancestry by birthplace of parent or grandparent, which might include in the census data many ‘white settlers’ who had chosen to move to Australia before PNG Independence in 1975, after residing more than one generation in PNG. Furthermore, Sykes’s critical assessment of the usual measures of the PNG population, such as data derived from the property register, as well as school and health registers, exposed the inadequacy of these indicators for capturing the reticulating mode of settlement that typifies PNG households, with multiple residences in Queensland and PNG. 

 Sykes and her RAs \(Nalisa Neuendorf and Vincent Backhaus\) collected an ethnographic record of the moral economy of the PNG presence from accounts of life in 60\+ households and histories of household composition and settlement over three generations. Extended case studies, ethnographic interviews in family kitchens, qualitative surveys, and social network maps revealed a reticular migration pattern over two generations. Ethnography allowed Sykes to show that PNG identity was determined by a moral economy of people’s habits of association, rather than by measures of ancestral descent and property ownership. Data on the use of money and household provisioning evidenced the supportive linkages across many residences, revealing the character of the multi\-residence PNG household and its habit of connecting members across great distances in the Asia Pacific region. Families mobilise multiple residences in Australia and PNG to act as one transnational household to provide care for aged parents over the course of a year and to support education for children from the village. In Queensland, PNG people disperse themselves as homeowners, choosing to settle at distance from other PNG people and not cluster together in one neighbourhood, yet they encounter each other in farmers’ markets, at church gatherings, at their children’s school and sporting events, and in the comfort of air\-conditioned shopping malls. Therefore, Sykes defined the PNG household broadly \(mixed race, loose and changing membership, multi\-residential\) and made visible the scale of the community created by their interactions and transactions over both great distances and protracted times. The discussion of this domestic moral economy is published in a book chapter \[2\] and a series of journal articles \[3, 4, 5\]. Project RA, Nalisa Neuendorf co\-authored an article in *GeoForum* \[6\]. 

  

 The findings of Sykes and her RAs suggested that access to the PNG population in Queensland would be more successful if government services, church officers, and businesses contacted any of the numerous women who are well connected within the multi\-residential transnational households, than if they tried to contact \(non\-existent\) neighbourhoods, settlements, or enclaves of Papua New Guineans. These women carried news of comings and goings of people in different households, and thereby moved individuals to seek each other out while they were in the same town. The permanence of the Papua New Guinean Catholic Centre \(PNGCC\), directed by a committee of PNG women, created a reliable point of contact for the community by facilitating and even intensifying this kind of message carrying. It has become a vehicle to support PNG people in building community and supporting their mutual well\-being.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Sykes’s research into PNG household composition led to the founding of the PNGCC in Cairns, the largest city in the northern regions of Queensland. PNG families do not form an enclave or neighbourhood in Cairns. Instead their residences are widely spread throughout the small towns of the city’s hinterlands. They do not connect by internet in this region where broadband provision is weak, but it is common to meet with other families while shopping in the city. The PNGCC is located in Raintrees Shopping Centre with its affordable shops and medical and dental services. It is a short drive to the government offices of Cairns and very near to St Francis Xavier’s Church where news of the Centre’s activities is shared through the Catholic community and PNGCC directors use the church office facilities to support their work. 

 Sykes’s research into the wide dispersal of PNG residences was used first to draft a policy for PNG people written by **\[Text removed for publication\]**, whose ardent interest in the well\-being of the Papua New Guineans in Australia shaped his work as a Diocesan priest at St Francis Xavier’s Church. When he relocated from PNG to Australia, he sought support from his Bishop for the large mobile community of unknown numbers of PNGs, now on his doorstep in the north of Queensland. The Diocese of Cairns chose to support the proposal and open a PNG community centre. 

  

 **Pathways to Impact** 

 **Development of the proposal for a PNG Catholic Centre** 

 Sykes shared key research findings over three public presentations in 2014, all to larger groups of PNG men and women who were members of different churches in the area \(Catholic, Seventh\-Day Adventist, United\-Methodist, and Salvation Army\). These presentations addressed: a meeting of 30 PNG women who represented various social groups in the region \(including popular clubs and sports\); a meeting of 8 church leaders working with PNG families; and a meeting of 60 PNG women and men from the wider PNG community. In these meetings, Sykes discussed PNG transnational households and their multi\-residential composition across Australia and PNG, and sometimes into the South Pacific, southeast Asia, Europe and North America. She highlighted the ways that people moved between the households, and the urban lifestyle of Cairns and Australia more widely, which created the need for a strong PNG community beyond the immediate family unit. 

 Additional meetings were held in 2014 to discuss Sykes’s findings in more detail, with aged care providers and several local government civil servants who knew the challenges facing the most vulnerable PNG people, such as the PNG widows of white Australian men who lacked support from their husband’s family and friends, and had only weak or no connections with members of other PNG families. These PNG individuals might ‘fall through the cracks’ between PNG households, and be overlooked by organizations that typically support mostly elderly white Australian women. Sykes’s research created the opportunity to speak about the issues raised by her research more generally and recognise the need for preliminary reports pertaining to the problem of care for the aged. During late 2014, Sykes held three one\-to\-one meetings with **\[Text removed for publication\]** in order to discuss her research findings in more depth. He used these discussions to develop his proposal to the Diocese of Cairns for a PNG Centre. The **\[Text removed for publication\]**, states that ‘ *together \[Sykes and* **\[Text removed for publication\]** *\] recognized that the research evidence pointed to a need for a PNG Centre to draw people into a community’* \[A\] in order to support the wellbeing of all members. 

 **Impact** 

 **Opening of the PNG Catholic Centre** 

 The Centre was envisaged as a meeting point for all PNGs in the region. The Diocese’s support included: 

1.  Allocating a portion of **\[Text removed for publication\]** time to assist the PNGCC Director. 

1.  Dedicating office space and administrative support at St Francis Xavier’s Church to support the Centre; and funding the refurbishment of the physical space at Raintrees shopping mall. 

1.  Making a formal commitment to the saying of a ‘PNG’ mass once a month to strengthen the spiritual community. The mass is said in Tok Pisin \(one of PNG’s three official languages\) and is attended regularly by 150–200 people in St Francis Xavier’s Church. 

 **Continuing impact of the Centre for the PNG population** 

 The significance of the Centre is felt today in the role it plays as a physical space bringing PNG families into a community of mutual support. **\[Text removed for publication\]** describes the vision of the PNGCC ‘ *to help the PNG community more broadly, simply by providing a space to meet for all Papua New Guineans. The Centre supports families who might attend regular events, and other Papua New Guineans who might simply drop in for a friendly chat’* \[A\]. This significance can be evidenced in various ways: 

1.  Daily community events hosted by the Centre: Arts and Crafts Groups; PNG Music Groups, PNG Mother’s Group, as well as groups that offer spiritual community \(such as Friday rosary\). **\[Text removed for publication\]** notes that regular attendance is upwards of 40 people in some of these events, but they also welcome drop\-in guests. Although the Centre does not keep a formal membership, its Facebook website is followed by 690 members of the community, and is used to share details of events, community discussions, videos and photos \[B\]. 

1.  The reach of the PNGCC is extended by the work of Centacare, the Social Services agency of the Catholic Diocese of Cairns, whose communications between other service providers and the wider network of PNG families support community building at a wider level \[C\]. 

1.  For example, project RA Nalisa Neuendorf \[F\] used the PNGCC to organise a 2018 workshop for the Centacare programme, ‘Our Place’, because it is the only space dedicated to hosting regular PNG community meetings. Neuendorf returns regularly to help out at the Centre, and to support what is now a successful community\-building programme \[C\]. 

1.  The casual style of the PNGCC \[B\] helps to solidify the PNG families into a community of mutual support. The Centre welcomes anyone that drops by, offering them informal casual conversations and referrals. For example, widowed PNG women began to drop into the Centre for companionship in the different mid\-week groups, often on recommendation of funeral directors and health care professionals and workers who knew they needed friends. 

 The PNGCC nurtures general wellbeing in all these ways. In their work, the Centre’s leaders focus on key issues for sustaining, supporting and building community. 

 **Capacity building** 

 Sykes’s research enhanced the capacities of the community to research its own interests. Each of the two Research Assistants in Cairns completed doctorates and found employment in research and higher education. While working with Sykes, the Research Assistants learned techniques for mapping social networks, as well as interviewing skills. Later they were both re\-employed on an ARC grant to study ageing amongst PNG expats in Australia \[D\]. Vincent Backhaus turned to questions of second\-generation migrant socialisation and education, and completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge. He now heads the Centre for Indigenous Education at James Cook University \(JCU\), having first established a programme to facilitate retention of second generation Indigenous and Pacific Islander students in secondary education \[E\]. Nalisa Neuendorf received her PhD \(JCU, 2020\) with Sykes as an external supervisor, becoming the second PNG woman to complete a PhD in Anthropology \[F\]. Neuendorf worked in the community services sector throughout the project and facilitated community\-building workshops for Centacare in Cairns. She is now employed as a researcher at the PNG International Medical Research Institute in Goroka, conducting projects on community\-based responses to domestic violence as a health crisis.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Organosilicon compounds contain carbon–silicon bonds whose properties, including stability, water repellent abilities, and colourlessness make them widely used in commercial applications. OU research has resulted in new organosilicon compounds for industry using new routes, in high purity, on large scale and reproducibly. One of the high performance liquid chromatography \(HPLC\) columns produced as part of a knowledge transfer protocol \(KTP\) with Hichrom has been selected by the U.S.A Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) as an official FDA analytical protocol, because of its unique selectivity, reliability and reproducibility. This is used to test the purity of a commonly used over the counter drug – Zantac, to reduce risk of carcinogenic impurities and enable sales of the drug. Hichrom has only been able to do this as a result of OU research, and sold around 22,000 columns with income over GBP12,000,000. This subsequently led to a development of new products with chemicals company Cornelius Specialities, road markings specialists WJ Group, technology membership organisation TWI and global chemicals company Johnson Matthey.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 A group at the Open University has been undertaking research in Organosilicon chemistry 

 for over 40 years in a range of areas, including mechanistic and hypervalent silicon chemistry, biological silicon chemistry, synthetic organosilicon chemistry and the synthesis and properties of silsesquioxane cages \(silicon\-oxygen colourless solids with polymeric structures\). The key area of underpinning work related to the impact in the REF period has been the synthesis of organosilicon compounds selectively, in high purity, reproducibly and potentially on a large scale. 

 The organosilicon chemistry developed by the OU group in an academic context can be used to solve a range of specific problems within Industry. Companies have come to the OU to investigate specific problems outside the academic research but with relevant applications. The element silicon is a semimetal and when combined with carbon forms organosilicon compounds. The presence of the silicon atom in the organosilicon compounds leads to unique physical and chemical properties for example, organosilicon compounds \(e.g. silicones\) are used in applications ranging from bath sealants to cupcake trays, as well as body implants, sealants, adhesives, lubricants, personal care products \(Methicone\) and contact lens additives. Their unique chemical reactivity has led to a separate field of study and OU organosilicon chemists have a deep understanding of how these compounds behave chemically and can thus synthesise new organosilicon compounds in high yield and purity. The OU group are world leaders in organosilicon chemistry and have used their knowledge to produce a new class of compound known as silsequioxanes researched hypervalent silicon compounds and developed new chemical transformations using organosilicon compounds. Armed with this unique knowledge of how to make and use organosilicon compounds, the OU group have been able to help a large number of companies develop their products. 

 For example, one of the key intermediates industry has been interested in are trialkoxysilanes, that are often used to coat silica particles. These are the types of compounds used to make the HPLC columns described in the impact statement. Expertise in making such compounds has been developed though making a wide range of trialkoxysilanes for the synthesis of silsesquioxane cages, regular three\-dimensional structures such as cubes and prisms made out of R\-Si\(O\-\)<sub>3</sub> units as shown below \[O1, O2\]: 



 The OU researchers developed a simple route to these compounds from trialkoxysilanes \(RSi\(OEt\)<sub>3</sub>\) using tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride \[O2\]. The pendant R groups provide the materials with a range of properties such as liquid crystals, metal complexing and protein binding \[O3\]. So, in order to make a wide range of different silsesquioxanes the OU group have had to develop a wide range of routes to trialkoxysilanes which can be very water sensitive. Synthesising a new trialkoxysilane requires careful planning through a knowledge of the way these organosilicon compounds react, what to avoid, how to maximise the yield and how to purify the products. For example, one of the key reactions used is known as hydrolsilylation which requires a platinum catalyst. Knowing which type of platinum catalyst to use, which solvent and the reaction conditions is essential to ensure high yields and purity \[O6\]. The OU group have developed a toolbox of key reactions used to synthesise trialkoxysilanes with a wide range of R groups, in the high purity required for the synthesis of silsesquioxanes, which also has wide application in industry. The OU team supplied the characterisation of new materials and analysed their properties on instrumentation not available at the companies. Feedback of this data further improved the synthesis and the properties of these novel materials. 

 The team have gone on to synthesise and characterise a new class of compound where a fluoride ion is trapped in the centre of the cage \[O4\]. Again, they have had to synthesise different alkoxysilanes, this time with electron withdrawing groups, which provided new insights into the way alkoxysilanes are made, handled and reacted \[O5\]. 

 As part of the research into hypervalent silicon compounds and organosilicon compounds in organic synthesis, the researchers have had to carry out other types of reaction such as hydrosilylation, Suzuki coupling and organolithium and Grignard methodologies **\[O6\]**. The expertise in using these reactions to make organosilicon compounds was the basis of KTPs with three different companies, albeit with very different target compounds. For example, whilst Hichrom were focussed on trialkoxysilanes, Cornelius Specialities wanted routes to organosilicon intermediates for use in the contact lens and personal care industries. This led to a toolbox of reactions, based on couplings and organometallics that we had developed as part of our research, which Cornelius Specialities could use to make their targets. WJ needed our methodology and expertise to develop new alterative materials for road marking.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 OU research into the creation and function of organosilicon compounds has created benefit for chemicals companies supplying markets as diverse as pharmaceuticals, personal care, road markings and industrial consultancy for the offshore industry. 

 A collaboration with Hichrom, underpinned by this research, led to the development of High Performance Liquid Chromatography \(HPLC\) columns which are used to demonstrate the safety of the world’s best\-selling drug. Zantac, generically known as ranitidine, is one of the world’s leading treatments of excess stomach acid production. In 2018 nearly 25 million prescriptions were written for ranitidine in the USA and Sanofi, who sell under brand name Zantac, made USD124,000,000 sales in the USA. In September 2019, the USA’s Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) became aware that an impurity present in some formulations known as *N*\-nitrosodimethylamine \(NDMA\) had potential carcinogenic properties which led to the withdrawal of Zantac from the market **\[C1\]**. In order for pharmaceutical companies to reintroduce Zantac they needed to show that the levels of NDMA were low enough to reduce the risk of cancer. 

 The FDA developed a \(HPLC\) – Mass Spectrometry \(MS\) technique for the analysis of NDMA in ranitidine samples **\[C2\]**. This technique involves separating the individual compounds present in a sample and then analysing them. At the heart of the separation process is an HPLC column, a long column of very small silica particles coated with specific material that promotes the separation of the compounds in the sample. The column chosen by the FDA for their crucial analysis of ranitidine is the Ace C18\-AR column which researchers at the OU created as part of a KTP with Hichrom **\[C2,** line 22 of p.2 and **C3\]**. The column was chosen by the FDA because of its remarkable properties, its stability and its reproducibility. Hichrom was able to produce this novel column as a result of the OU’s expertise in synthesising new organosilicon compounds such as trialkoxysilanes that can be bound to the silica particles and in particular the method of making them in a very pure form, which can be reproduced on a large scale \(with high yields\) without dependence upon a single raw materials supplier **\[O5, O6\]**. This synthetic expertise has been developed over many years of making organosilicon compounds as a result of the research described in section 2. 

 Hichrom had an excellent record of manufacturing reliable and reproducible columns but in 2010 they lacked the expertise to be able to synthesise organosilicon compounds and had to rely on what was commercially available. They approached OU to enter a partnership to produce a new range of HPLC columns and create compounds that their competitors could not. First, they funded a Post\-Doctoral worker for a year to work at the OU and this grew into a three\-year 

 KTP worth GBP200,000 \(2010 – 2014\), which was subsequently classified as outstanding by Innovate UK. The KTP’s aim was to develop new columns that have orthogonal selectivity, that is they have different mechanisms for separating the materials, and thus together create a toolkit for analysis of any mixture. This was successful in that five new columns were produced **\[C4\]** and Hichrom have sold about 22,000 of these columns over the last six years **\[C5**, p.1 **\]**. This has greatly increased in recent years at an average of GBP540 giving a sales value of over GBP12,000,000 **\[C5,** p.2, **C6\]**. The partnership between the OU and Hichrom has continued up to the present day and a Hichrom employee now works on synthesis within the OU group/laboratories. As the then CEO stated in the final KTP report “ *new agile development techniques have speeded up the development of silanes from one every 20 months before the KTP to successfully commercialising 5 in three years*” **\[C7,** p.9 **\]**. In addition, Hichrom’s improved reputation for innovation and reliability has led to acquisition by VWR, part of Avantor **\[C8\]**. 

 The OU team’s research on the synthesis of organosilicon compounds described in Section 2 also led to an approach from Cornelius Specialities. This involved a further KTP \(2013 – 2017, \~GBP200,000\) to develop a toolkit of reactions that could be used to manufacture intermediates on a large\-scale for the contact lens industry **\[C9\]**. Again, the OU’s unique experience of synthesising organosilicon compounds was used to target new, cheaper routes to existing intermediates and to create new compounds \- specifically reliably and in high purity. The company reported that: “ *our novel silicon chemistry toolkit \[…\] enabled us to make a range of existing and new products in high yield and with high purity. Our methodology was specifically designed to ensure we were competitive with price as well*” **\[C8**, p.4 **\]**. Having successfully developed a toolkit for contact lens intermediates, the OU team worked with Cornelius to target the personal care industry as an alternative client base: “ *This has led to a greater understanding of how organosilicon compounds can add value to a range of products such as personal care which will lead to a greater and more varied use of organosilicon compounds in the future*” **\[C8**, p.5 **\]**. 

 As a result of the new opportunities opened up through developing new compounds, 

 “*Cornelius Specialties Ltd \(CSL\) is manoeuvring itself to exploit other market opportunities from silicone materials that it is now able to develop as a result of this partnership*” **\[C8**, p.6 **\]**. 

 The company therefore required additional space to exploit its Engineered Silcones potential and invested GBP240,000 in new plant and machinery **\[C8**, p.10 **\]**. 

 The Welding Institute \(TWI\) is a contract research organization that works for and on behalf of over 700 industrial members in over 4,500 locations world\-wide. TWI and OU have been working together on the development of super hydrophobic coatings, that is surfaces that repel water, based on silica nanoparticles with a specific organosilicon coating. OU and TWI have been focussing on how they can control their processes and produce coatings that are more reproducible with a range of properties. TWI’s Technology Fellow noted: “ *As a result, we gained an insight into how the experimental conditions determined the final structure and material properties of our materials and coatings and we able to increase their hydrophobicity as a result. We were able to go further and apply the expertise developed in the partnership to control the synthesis of silica\-based nanoparticles. This allowed us to control both the size and the surface of the nanoparticles which allows us to influence their material properties and more significantly incorporate the nanoparticles into some of our existing coating materials”* \[ **C9**\]. The partnership with the OU continues to exploit the advances made in synthesising nanoparticles which are being applied to a new project funded by TWI. This applies the new knowledge to make composite materials recyclable through using nanoparticles to control the assembly and, more importantly disassembly. This has the potential to greatly enhance the ability of TWI industrial members to recover and recycle the composite materials they use **\[C9\]**. 

 WJ Group is the UK’s leading specialist road marking business dedicated to permanent and temporary road markings, and other specialist road fixings and surfaces such as road studs, and high friction and safety surfacing. In 2014, OU and WJ Group embarked on a three\-year KTP. As a result, WJ Group acquired a capability to apply road marking products all year round, along with the development of an R&D capability to continue producing high performing cold products with which to enter the GBP750m Northern European market **\[C10,** p.2 **\]**. The KTP reinforced WJ Product’s position as market leader and industry innovator from the sale of hot and cold state\-of\-the\-art products **\[C10,** p.2\]. The Managing Director of WJ Product division noted that the work with the OU ‘ *made a significant contribution to the WJ Groups expansion both in terms of commercial activity and R&D’* and transformed the way the company operates with a ‘ *game\-changing’* methodology for designing and testing new materials giving a rapid go/no go decision when developing new products **\[C11\]**. This has enabled the business to acquire new customers and as a result WJ Group now works with the Dutch equivalent to Highways England; ‘Rijkswaterstaat’. The work has enabled WJ Group to become the ‘go\-to expert’ in micro\-plastics in road markings, enabling them to develop case studies for Highways England investment in more sustainable materials **\[C11\]**. 

 Further work building on this research with Johnson Matthey is developing techniques to recover metals from waste streams, acid mine drainage and wastewater, using silica materials modified with chelates for metals. This enables Johnson Matthey to meet its strategic aims to participate in the increasingly sustainable circular economy. So far, the work has led to novel and commercially applicable materials for which Johnson Matthey is applying for a patent and is also being deployed in the wider company **\[C12\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The music of John Cage, Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff presents complex challenges to interpretation and performance, which have inhibited the development of a living performance practice and contributed to the marginalisation of a historically significant body of musical repertoire. Since 2008 Professor Philip Thomas has investigated this repertoire specifically from the perspective of performance, advancing new understandings of how it may be brought persuasively to life through scholarly publications, concerts, recordings and innovative online resources, with impact on a range of non\-academic beneficiaries. Thomas’s research has unlocked the secrets of New York experimentalism for international audiences in concert halls, at home, and in educational settings; it has encouraged amateur performers to engage with this repertoire and helped professional performers deepen their engagement; it has also generated reputational and economic benefit for a range of individuals and organisations within the contemporary\-music world. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 During the 1950s and 1960s, the ‘New York School’ of experimental composers – specifically, John Cage, Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff – sought radically to reconceive the relationship between composer and performer by composing music in which many decisions were left to the performer. The aim of this indeterminacy was to liberate performers from servitude to the composer. But the unorthodox notations used in such works have deterred many performers, meaning that our understanding of New York experimentalism in performance has been dominated by the idiosyncratic approaches of the composers’ original collaborators. As a result, this repertoire has not generated the living performance practice that it merits, with relatively few modern\-day performances \(especially of Cage and Wolff\) and very limited public understanding of these composers’ important contributions. Through scholarly research and extensive performance\-led enquiry, as well as many concerts, broadcasts and sound recordings, Professor Philip Thomas has brought new life to the performance of repertoire that risked being confined to the textbooks. 

 In 2009, an AHRC Research Leave Grant \(£23,599\) and a Getty Library Research Grant \($1,500\) enabled Thomas to explore the performance practice of indeterminate piano music by Cage and Wolff. Archival research in New York and Los Angeles, interviews with Wolff, and a series of public concerts of Wolff’s piano music, led to Thomas’s co\-edited book on Wolff’s music **\[3.1\]** and the recordings of Wolff described in section 4. A further project publication proposed an approach to the realisation of Cage’s *Solo for Piano* \(1958\) **\[3.2\]** that moves beyond the realisations documented in historic recordings. At the Getty Library, Thomas also examined David Tudor’s realisations of indeterminate music by Feldman, research that was later to bear fruit in Thomas’s 2018/19 recording of Feldman’s piano music **\[3.6\]**. This five\-disc set includes three world premiere recordings, and contains a 50\-page booklet by Thomas addressing the challenges of Feldman’s notation, and the insights that arise from using Feldman’s original manuscripts in performance. 

 Thomas’s Cage article **\[3.2\]** laid the groundwork for a second AHRC\-funded project \(£508,000; 2015–2018\) examining John Cage’s large\-scale *Concert for Piano and Orchestra* \(1958\). The project was led by Thomas as PI, with Professor Martin Iddon \(University of Leeds\) as Co\-I, and Dr Emily Payne \(University of Leeds\) and Dr Christopher Melen \(University of Huddersfield\) as research assistants. The project sought to demystify a work whose extravagant notations are familiar from books on twentieth\-century music, but whose realisation in performance has been little explored. As an experienced performer of the *Concert*, Thomas took a leading role in examining the history of the work in performance **\[3.4\]**, and developing resources that could assist future performers. Primary amongst the latter is the *cageconcert.org* website **\[3.5\]**, which explores in great detail the practicalities involved in realising the work. The ‘Performing’ section of the website is based upon video interviews with Thomas and the musicians of the ensemble Apartment House – whose new recording of the *Concert* was another project output **\[3.3\]** – examining how each instrumentalist interpreted Cage’s notations, as well as the conductor’s role and how the players combine in performance. Extensive explanatory text \(32,000 words\) and archival images complement these videos. The website also houses two innovative apps, developed by Melen under the direction of Thomas and Iddon, that offer hands\-on engagement with the notational mechanics of the *Concert*. The ‘ *Solo for Piano* App’ enables users to experiment with the indeterminate notations used in the *Solo for Piano* \(the *Concert*’s piano part\). It offers an analysis of each notation, considering options for interpretation, and a performance tool, allowing users to generate different realisations. The ‘ *Concert* *Player* App’ allows users to explore the flexibility that Cage offers for scoring and duration of the *Concert*. Built around 3,000 individual sound recordings, the app allows users to choose from 16,383 possible instrumental combinations and different orderings of pages, to automatically and instantly generate fresh audio performances of the *Concert*. In combination, the apps afford a vastly greater array of ways of experiencing the *Concert* than is offered by the handful of existing recordings, and they also extend the pleasures and rewards of the performative realisation of indeterminate music to non\-specialists.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 During the assessment period, Thomas has brought his research on New York experimentalism to diverse non\-academic audiences through 33 public concerts \(in 10 UK cities, plus venues in USA, Canada and the Netherlands\), eight CD releases \(containing 19 discs on four labels\), 11 broad\-casts on BBC national radio \(including live concert relays, CD airplay and reviews, and a feature on Radio 3’s ‘Music Matters’ on the Cage *Concert* project \[audience reach 192,000\]\), and a series of 63 YouTube videos of Wolff’s piano music specially recorded during the 2020 lockdown \(2,509 views to date\). New audiences have been reached through performances in art galleries \(Tate Britain; the Serpentine\), airtime on BBC Radio 6, and participatory educational workshops. Together with the digital resources and scholarly publications discussed above, these activities have brought distinct benefits to concert and CD audiences, professional and amateur performers, and individuals and organisations in the contemporary music world, as described below. 

 **Unlocking New York experimentalism for audiences** 

 The presenter of BBC Radio 3’s ‘Music Matters’ writes of Thomas’s *‘rare ability to decode, demystify and make sense of music that still seems forbiddingly remote to many listeners*’ **\[5.1, p.1\]**. This capacity to unlock the secrets of New York experimentalism is evidenced in the testi\-mony of concert\-goers, record buyers and music critics. Typical is an online review of a November 2013 Feldman concert by Thomas: ‘ *It was one of those rare performances where you feel changed afterwards. If I could, I would still be there, listening*’ **\[5.2, pp.1\-2\]**. Specialists and non\-specialists alike have remarked upon how Thomas’s performances have opened new doors to this repertoire. Writing on Thomas’s CD of Cage’s *Winter Music* \(2017\), a critic noted he was *‘not the biggest fan of Cage’s music* … *\[often\] coming away from his work bored and frustrated’*, but that he was *‘pleasantly surprised’* by this performance, which he found an *‘invigoratingly urgent … sonic experience – with very fleeting moments of melancholic beauty’* **\[5.2, p.3\]**. Thomas’s performances of Feldman have similarly brought new converts: *'Sublime recital of Morton Feldman's piano music from @philip\_thomas\_1 last night, much of it new to me. Time for a deep dive*’; *‘If, like me, you know little of Feldman’s music, I would urge you to have a listen*’ **\[5.3; 5.2, p.4\]**. The extensive liner notes that Thomas provides for his recordings are often singled out for aiding a new appreciation and understanding: *‘\[the\] notes are as illuminating as anything I’ve read on the challenges of per\-forming, recordings and listening to Feldman’*; *‘they make enlightening reading, particularly when combined with listening to the music itself’*; *‘Philip’s booklet texts are exemplary’* **\[5.2, p. 6, p.8\]**. 

 The *cageconcert.org* website and apps \(launched November 2019\) **\[3.5\]** use new technologies to offer audiences insights that considerably extend what is possible in the concert hall or on CD. The Vice\-President for New Music & Rights at Cage’s music publisher Peters US writes: *‘Cage’s music has frequently been misunderstood and has also often been badly performed. The website and apps created by Philip Thomas and his team will go a long way towards helping on both counts. … The listener can use the website and app to dig deeper into the work … in a way that was not possible before this website and app were available’* **\[5.1, p.2\]**. In its first 13 months the website had 10,980 page views from the UK, USA, Canada, Europe, Japan and Argentina \(1,159 to the two apps\); 26% of visitors were return users. The apps are a particularly powerful tool for enabling non\-specialists to have a hands\-on experience of this repertoire, allowing users to create their own realisations without requiring great expertise in music notation. The Senior Curator of music venue Café Oto writes that the apps *‘make Cage's work more tactile and engaging for new audiences, and emancipate it in some ways from any academic/hierarchical structures’* **\[5.1, p.3\]**. For these reasons, the apps offer an enticing entry point into Cage’s music; one app user wrote to Thomas: *‘I heard you talking about \[the Concert Player App\] on Radio 3’s Music Matters last night ... and have been playing it today … It’s good, really inspiring, and a way in to John Cage’s music for someone who hasn’t heard much of it until now’* **\[5.4, p.9\]**. At the public launch for the website, respondents – ranging from amateur and professional musicians, to listeners and those studying and working in the music sector – commented on how the site *‘really gets under the skin of the piece’* and *‘makes \[the\] music more accessible’* **\[5.4, pp. 1\-2\]**. Two subsequent public online workshops in July 2020 attracted a predominantly non\-academic audience \(15\) from the UK, USA and South America, with feedback attesting to how the website *‘has already greatly deepened my understanding of what’s entailed in performing the Concert for Piano and Orchestra and Cage’s music more generally’*, and has *‘made me think about how this \[approach\] could be applied to other indeterminate pieces to fully explore their possibilities’* **\[5.4, p.4\]**. Users have since fed back on how the apps *‘bring clarity to what can seem an overwhelming piece’*, and praise their *‘interactivity and the ease to see and hear multiple versions of the piece so readily’* **\[5.4, p.7\]**. These new resources are also being deployed in educational settings. An Illinois educator has used the *Concert* *Player* App in classes on experimentalism for the junior students of the Illinois String Academy, and to stimulate new creative ideas within his community composition workshop All Score Urbana. He writes that *‘something wonderful’* came from *‘interactions with the website and app’*, as a young All Score student experimented with indeterminacy for the first time: the resulting graphic score was realised in different ways by two staff members \(now uploaded to YouTube\), and *‘the student felt empowered by the experience and pleased with the results’* **\[5.1, pp. 5\-6\]**. 

 **Supporting performers to engage with experimental music** 

 A primary motivation for the Cage *Concert* project was to offer new tools for performers interested in playing Cage’s music. As the Promotion Manager at Edition Peters notes, *‘Cage’s instructions on how to translate this score into a performance often puts off any would\-be performers from tackling the work, for fear of misinterpreting the musical systems, or because some of the instruc\-tions are written confusingly even for people “in\-the\-know”\! What Martin Iddon and Philip Thomas’ research does is to lift the veil on the mysteries of this composition’* **\[5.1, p.7\]**. The website and apps have already been used to support a professional performance of the Cage *Concert* in San Francisco \(2020\); the pianist wrote to Thomas *‘it has been really wonderful \- and validating\! \- to comb through your site and watch your video on preparing the piece. It's like meeting a fellow hiker on a path in the wilderness’* **\[5.4, p.10\]**. Thomas’s Cage research has also benefited organisations working with amateur and young performers. In 2020 Thomas led two CoMA \(Contemporary Music for All\) workshops in London and Glasgow with over 20 amateur musicians; these examined the Cage *Concert* and ended with performances of part of the work involving all participants. Participants evidently learnt a great deal and had their enthusiasm stoked for more: *‘I gained a whole new understanding – the score is now exciting and not terrifying\!’*; *‘It was lovely to have this first experience of the piece as a performer rather than just studying\!’*; *‘I’ll take away new knowledge, and an interest in performing more Cage’* **\[5.5, p.1\]**. CoMA’s Glasgow coordinator observed how Thomas’s guidance *‘unlocked the potential and confidence of “soloists”, especially among the people who are normally very shy to perform on their own’*, meaning that *‘the excerpt we worked on could easily become one of our CoMA Glasgow repertoire pieces **’** \[5.5, p.4\]**. In 2020 Thomas was also lead advisor for a Cage project planned for the London Sinfonietta’s Junior Academy course. The project was cancelled due to the pandemic, but Thomas’s input changed the Sinfonietta’s thinking about how to bring Cage’s music to the Academy’s young participants. The Sinfonietta’s Participation and Learning Officer writes of how Thomas’s participation *‘provided us with the opportunity to fully understand the piece and \[how to\] introduce young people to contemporary music in a way they would not have considered previously. … Philip's help with understanding the piece and Cage's intentions meant we were able to plan a thorough project to engage young musicians in contemporary music and take ownership of a piece’* **\[5.1, p.8\]**. 

 For the performers of ensemble Apartment House, participation in the Cage *Concert* project brought new insights for their professional practice. The extended timescale of the project was *‘a luxury for a professional musician used to working within a tight timeframe*’, making it possible *‘to explore in much greater depth … \[Cage’s\] ideas and the ways in which I might deal with them on a practical level as a performing musician’* **\[5.7\]**. One musician wrote of how *‘coming away from this kind of music\-making I had* *a new, freer and more flexible perspective on the other music I play’*. Being interviewed for the project website was ‘ *a further extension beyond my normal experience … \[which\] introduced me to the growing importance of digital resources to connect to emerging audiences for our work*’ **\[5.7\]**. The Cage project built on Thomas’s long\-standing involvement with Apartment House, of which the ensemble’s founder says: *‘Many of the works that we perform demand an intellectual acumen and almost visionary approach, and Philip has always been an outstanding musician to have on board with regards to unravelling such compositional intricacies. In ensemble matters his calm and generous approach to music making has always inspired others and created a progressive and positive atmosphere’* **\[5.1, p.9\]**. Apartment House also benefited from the funding \(£14,700\) attached to the Cage project, which enabled both employment for the musicians and the commissioning of a new work for the ensemble by Christian Wolff \(see below\). 

 **Generating benefit for individuals and organisations in the contemporary music world** 

 By generating new public and performer interest in this repertoire, Thomas’s research has brought significant reputational and economic benefits for other individuals and organisations. Foremost amongst these is the sole surviving member of the New York School, Christian Wolff \(b. 1934\). Wolff writes that *‘over the last ten or so years \[Thomas\] has been one of the most important people in the furthering of my music. He has arranged two important commissions, with generous money, one for a longer solo piano piece,* Sailing By *\(2014\), the other for a large \(40 minute\) piano and chamber orchestra piece,* Resistance *\(2017\)* **\[3.3\]** *. … Thomas was the driving force behind the \[first\-ever\] collection of essays about my music \(*Changing the System **\[3.1\]** *\), to which he also con\-tributed an excellent essay on my piano music. This is the best overall account of my work. Finally, and not least, Thomas has been recording my complete piano music, of which 5 CDs are already out. … Thomas's contribution to furthering the cause and presence of a major portion of contem\-porary piano music … has been of first\-class quality and extraordinarily productive’* **\[5.1, p.10\]**. 

 The critical and public success of Thomas’s recordings of New York experimentalism have brought significant benefit to the record labels with whom he has worked. In the case of the Yorkshire\-based record label Another Timbre, this impact has been transformational. Another Timbre’s Director writes: *‘Philip Thomas’s impact on Another Timbre has been extraordinary. He has played on over 20 of the label’s 150 releases to date \(March 2020\), including many of the most successful in terms of both critical responses and sales. The Morton Feldman Piano 5\-CD box set* **\[3.6\]** *… has been phenomenally successful critically and financially … \[bringing\] an extraordinary amount of income into Another Timbre. … Normally the label’s income from CD sales is around £15,000–20,000 per year. … The total income from the \[Feldman\] box set alone is approximately £49,000 in the past 6 months’* \(1,400 copies sold, September 2019 to February 2020\) **\[5.1, pp.11\-12\]**. This financial windfall has been used by Another Timbre to support less profitable projects involving younger composers: *‘the success of the Feldman box set has enabled us to plan two batches of releases … focusing exclusively on little\-known composers who don’t \(yet\) have a reputation or following.* … *We have \[also\] been able to commission both the Canadian composer Martin Arnold \(£4,000\) and the Huddersfield\-based composer Ryoko Akama \(£2,000\) to write new series of solo piano works, as well as commissioning younger composers Eleanor Cully and Georgia Denham to write new ensemble works for Apartment House … \[and\] to record existing ensemble works by the Belgian composer Maya Verlaak for a CD release’* **\[5.1, p.11\]**. The Feldman set, listed by *The Guardian* as a ‘standout release of the year’ \(19 December 2019\), has also brought new audiences to the label: *‘it has reached a lot of people who have not bought anything from the label before, and in some cases had never heard of Another Timbre … Our email list … suggests that nearly 700 people who bought copies of the box set are new to Another Timbre. … \[S\]everal of these … have since come back and ordered other CDs’* **\[5.1, pp.11\-12\].** Thomas has also brought commercial success to other contemporary music labels: two Christian Wolff releases \(2014; 2019\) have earned £7,552 for Sub Rosa; and the CD set of Cage’s *Concert* and Wolff’s *Resistance* \(2018\) has earned £1,309 for Huddersfield Contemporary Records \(its second\-highest selling album\) **\[5.6\]**. 

 Concerts accompanying the 2019 release of the Feldman discs have brought unexpected benefits for concert promoters. The inclusion in **\[3.6\]** of a premiere recording of Feldman’s unpublished music for a 1954 film on the sculptor Seymour Lipton led to a first\-time collaboration between Yorkshire’s principal chamber music organisation Music in the Round and Sheffield’s annual digital festival Sensoria. The event combined Thomas’s live performances, projections of this and other films scored by Feldman, and introductions to the artists featured in the films by painter David Ainley. The Programme Manager at Music in the Round writes on how the event *‘offered our core audience members the chance to hear music that is outside their usual expectations. … The feedback from the audience was overwhelmingly positive, with a desire for more performances that widen their experiences of live music through exploring experimental and alternative repertoire. … The audience size exceeded our expectations and was, in turn, what we would consider to be a financial success. The success of the event and working with Philip, in particular, has undoubtedly acted as a catalyst for us, and it has brought about a number of new and surprising ideas at MitR that we aim to explore in the coming seasons’* **\[5.1, p.13\]**. A similar event at the Music We’d Like To Hear series at St Mary\-at\-Hill Church in the city of London attracted a higher than usual audience, with consequent benefit for the series’ future: the Lead Curator of the series writes: *‘Healthy ticket sales and funding enabled us able to pay everyone very well and secure a deposit to book our next series, which is something we don’t usually have spare funds to do’* **\[5.1, p.14\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Pernicious gender inequalities are prevalent globally and affect everyone. The World Bank estimated human capital losses due to gender inequality at over USD160 trillion \(2018\). Research by Jackson and Warin has significantly enhanced gender equality within educational contexts by shaping and influencing three key areas: 

 a\) Government thinking and strategies nationally and internationally. This includes Department  for Education \(DfE\) strategies to increase gender diversity in the UK early years workforce; strategies to tackle gender stereotyping, sexual harassment and violence through the UK Government Equalities Office and the Equality Challenge Unit; work by the Dutch Ministry of Education to address gendered achievement patterns; and reforms by the Flemish \(Belgian\) Ministry for Education affecting the school curricula of over 400,000 students. 

 b\) Behaviours, attitudes and practices relating to teacher workforce planning, teaching practices, and sexual violence training in over 20 universities across 4 countries. 

 c\) Understandings of gender among teachers, students and the general public, and research\-informed input to GCSE, AS and A\-level sociology syllabi which has underpinned the education of over 500,000 students between August 2013 and December 2020. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Centre for Social Justice and Wellbeing in Education \(CSJWE\) was founded by Jackson and Warin in 2011 and has produced a prize\-winning and influential body of research on gender in educational contexts. The research described below builds on their seminal joint work \(Jackson and Warin, 2000, British Educational Research Journal\), since which their common focus on gendered cultures has produced outstanding research across early years education \(Warin\) and secondary and higher education \(HE\) \(Jackson\). 

 **Heteronormative culture in education** 

 Warin’s work addresses the gendered teacher\-recruitment crisis in early childhood education, where in 2020 only 3% of the workforce were male \[G4\]. Her findings show that the heteronormative culture in pre\-school settings frequently positions male practitioners as upholders of hegemonic \(dominant\) masculinities \[R4\-R6\]. For example, male staff are allocated traditional ‘fatherly’ roles such as disciplinarians or providers of rough\-and\-tumble play. These findings were derived from successive studies over the last decade on: Swedish male preschool staff \(2011\-2014, \[G1\]\); case study of an English preschool \(2016\-2017, \[G2\]\); men’s career trajectories in early childhood education \(12 international partners\) \[R4,G3\]. Warin demonstrated that gender\-sensitive pre\-school environments can support gender flexibility and enhance gender equality when staff disrupt gender expectations by challenging traditional gender roles \[R4\]. She also developed a theoretical and evidence\-based rationale demonstrating that the education and care of young children by men are enhanced when based on gender flexibility \(which enhances equality\) rather than gender difference \(which entrenches inequality\) \[R4\-R6\]. This rationale provided the basis for her 3\-year ESRC\-funded study \[G4\] on gender diversification in the early years in which Warin collaborated with partners from Norway and the Fatherhood Institute’s Men in the Early Years \(MITEY\) campaign \(see project report \[S7a\] and website https://gendereye.org/\). Findings revealed: an absence of overall strategy in recruiting and supporting male practitioners with small advances made by isolated individuals; significant gaps in careers advice; a higher attrition rate for men; and the value of tailored support especially during periods of vulnerability. 

 **‘Lad’ culture in education** 

 ‘Lad culture’ has been highlighted by successive UK governments as a serious and widespread problem in secondary schools and HE. In secondary schools, concerns are primarily about academic achievement, as the notion that it is ‘uncool’ to be seen to work hard academically is central to lad culture. Within HE, concerns focus largely on gender\-based violence, sexism and sexual harassment. 

 Jackson’s award\-winning research in secondary schools \[R1\] offers a distinctive and innovative understanding of laddism by combining social psychological theories about motivation with sociological theories about masculinities and femininities. Based on in\-depth individual interviews with 203 pupils and 30 teachers across 8 schools and 779 questionnaire responses \[G5,G6\], Jackson offers a new way of theorising \(and addressing\) laddism in secondary schools in which laddism is understood as being motivated by fears of social and academic failure experienced by both boys and girls. Previous researchers had argued that many boys \(but not girls\) avoid overt hard work in school because it is associated with femininity. 

 Jackson began working on lad culture in HE in 2011, producing an award\-winning publication in 2015 with Dempster \(Lancaster\) and Pollard \(Greenwich\) through an interview\-based project with university students and staff \[R3,G7\]. Later, partnering with Sundaram \(York\), a new investigation \[G8\] built on previous research that explored students’ perceptions of lad culture, but this project was the first to explore staff perspectives. The research involved in\-depth interviews with 72 staff in a broad range of roles in 6 universities across England. It revealed that dominant understandings of lad culture, frequently trivialised as ‘boys being boys’, mask the deep\-rooted, structural inequalities that produce and perpetuate it. They offered a new theorisation of lad culture that made visible the gendered norms and intersecting structural inequalities that underpinned it, and demonstrated that tackling sexism, sexual harassment and violence in the UK and overseas requires cultural and structural change \[R2\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Achieving gender equality is one of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals to ‘transform our world’. Research by Jackson and Warin has enhanced gender equality in educational contexts by shaping and influencing: a\) government thinking and strategies;         b\) behaviours, attitudes and practices; and c\) understandings of gender. 

 **a\) Influencing government thinking and strategies to enhance gender equality** 

 <ins>Early years</ins> 

 Warin’s research has significantly influenced government policy on gender diversification in the early years’ workforce, providing a new justification for policies that challenge gender stereotypes. The author of the DfE’s ‘Early Years Workforce Strategy’ \(2017\) consulted with Warin for the chapter on the Gender Diversification of the Workforce. Subsequently, the DfE invited Warin to play a leading role in shaping the recommendations of the Gender Diversity Task and Finish Group, where she co\-authored the group’s report ‘Improving Gender Balance and Increasing Diversity in England’s Early Years Education \(EYE\) Workforce’ \(2018\) \[R5, S1\]. The group’s Chair commented that Warin’s research “ *made a significant contribution to public debate, raising general consciousness and influencing national policy to refocus on gender flexibility with the Early Years workforce”* \[S2\]. Recommendations included a national campaign to raise the profile of early years education as a career for men. Consequently, the DfE allocated funding \(GBP30,000\) to the Fatherhood Institute \(a partner in Warin’s ‘GenderEYE’ research\) for a Men in the Early Years \(MITEY\) conference \(Sept 2019\), with Warin as the keynote speaker. There were 130 participants, including from the Government Equalities Office, who gave extremely positive feedback and continue to follow Warin’s research, as corroborated by the Fatherhood Institute \[S3\]. 

 <ins>Secondary and</ins> <ins>higher education</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>and beyond</ins> 

 At a 2014 by\-invitation seminar hosted by the Minister for Women and Equalities, Jackson presented proposals to the Government Equalities Office \(GEO\) about challenging lad culture and gender stereotypes. Drawing on her research on lad culture in schools and HE \[R1\-3\], the proposals were incorporated into 5 \(of 6\) recommendations in the GEO’s report ‘ *The Watched Body*’ about how the UK Government, business, academia and the women’s sector should work together to achieve gender equality \[S4a,b\]. The GEO Report informed the Advertising Standards Agency’s \(ASA\) report ‘ *Depictions, Perceptions and Harm: A report on gender stereotyping in advertising’* \[S4c\] and subsequently their new ruling in 2018 to ban ‘harmful gender stereotypes’ \[S4d\]. Later, the Equality Challenge Unit \(ECU\) invited Jackson to a specialist seminar in May 2015 on ‘lad culture, sexual harassment, consent and sexual violence on university campuses’, where she reiterated her recommendations for cultural and structural changes. The ECU drew on these to inform a series of University UK \(UUK\) reports on ‘Changing the Culture’, which focused on understanding and combatting ‘lad’ culture and sexual harassment and violence in HE. The Office for Students have provided GBP4.7 million to universities since 2018 to support initiatives for change \(e.g., training to break down misconceptions about gender\-based violence and harassment\). 

 Jackson’s research on ‘effortless achievement’ and the ‘uncool to work’ discourse \[R3\] was used to explain and address patterns of gendered achievement in a 2015 report commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science \[S5\]. The research has also informed government thinking and strategies in Flanders. As an Advisor to the Flemish Department for Education and Department for Equal Opportunities testifies, “ *Professor Jackson’s research on advancing moves towards gender equality in education … underpinned our recommendations about tackling traditional gender\-role attitudes in specific school contexts … These recommendations have fed directly into current planning and curriculum reform by the Flemish Department and Ministry for Education which applies to all Flemish secondary schools \(952 schools with 427,456 students\) … Professor Jackson’s work has also informed school teachers and teaching practices across Flanders”* \[R1, S6\]. 

 **b\) Changing behaviours, attitudes and practices** 

 <ins>Early</ins> <ins>y</ins><ins>ears</ins> 

 Warin’s work has improved the gender equality\-related practices and attitudes of hundreds of pre\-school managers and practitioners in Bristol, Southampton, Bradford and London. They have changed their strategies \(e.g., changing language within job advertisements\) to recruit and support male staff through engaging with her research at the annual national MITEY conferences, attended by 452 early years personnel since 2016. Importantly, Warin’s work has enhanced gender equality by changing attitudes as well as behaviours: the head of the MITEY campaign stated that “ *Warin’s focus on establishing and transmitting a clear rationale for male recruitment is important, timely and influential … \[and\] underpinned the messaging of this campaign*” \[S3\]. The recent ‘GenderEYE’ project \(4,000 website views\) has further integrated research findings into recommendations for practitioners through the development of a training toolkit \[S7b\] \(downloaded 290 times\), 4 training sessions in 2020 and the establishment of a self\-support group by attendees where best practice about male teacher recruitment and support is shared. As a result of Warin’s presentation at the GenderEYE conference \(October 2020\), she was invited by the Council for Awards in Care, Health and Education \(CACHE\), to contribute her expertise on the recruitment of male Early Years teachers to their careers toolbox. 

 <ins>Secondary and</ins> <ins>higher education</ins> 

 Jackson’s research on lad culture, sexual harassment and violence \[R2\] underpinned the training programmes developed by the EU\-funded ‘USVreact’ project in which she was an Associate Partner and also keynote speaker at the project conference ‘Universities Supporting Survivors of Sexual Violence’ \(2018, University of York\). The project developed and delivered 7 programmes of sexual violence ‘first responder’ training that were tailored to local contexts. Over 700 staff in 21 universities across 4 European countries benefited from the training: UK \(10 universities\), Spain \(7\), Italy \(2\) and Greece \(2\), enabling them to respond appropriately to students or staff who report sexual and gender\-based violence. The final report noted “ *The UK was fortunate in having several key figures writing about gender violence on campus and about students’ experience of ‘lad culture’ at universities whose research informed the study from the start, in particular Alison Phipps, Carolyn Jackson, Vanita Sundaram …*” \[S8a, p20\]. The training was extensively evaluated, revealing very positive outcomes in terms of increased understanding of gendered and sexual violence and improved institutional support for survivors \[S8a\]. This is of great importance because poor responses can lead to further trauma, resistance to further disclosure and increased likelihood of additional psychological distress. A UK participant’s feedback reflected the views of many: “ *I also loved the fact that the training involved a large part of theorisation, reflection about root causes, contextualisation, discussion. We need the pragmatic advice, active listening practice and clear list of actions to take \(and we got them\), but responding to disclosure is so much more than setting a chain of actions into motion”* \[S8b\]. 

 **c\) Deepening understandings of gender** 

 <ins>Early</ins> <ins>y</ins><ins>ears</ins> 

 Warin’s research \[R4\] has drawn attention to the early years workforce as the least gender\-diverse caring profession amongst: a\) practitioners through ‘Nurseryworld’ and ‘Under 5s’ magazines \(readership estimated at 7,000 fortnightly and 60,000 monthly respectively\), the Day nurseries website \(8,727 views  in 2020: Kantar\), and b\) the general public through The Guardian \(reach: 1.9 million online\) and by forming the basis of a debate on the BBC’s Sunday Politics Show \(2019, 916,000: Kantar\) \[S10\]. The research has generated conceptual and instrumental impacts; her book on gender balance and flexibility \[R4\] is seen as transformative in the UK and internationally. For example, a teacher\-educator in early childhood education in Israel wrote to Warin, “ *I … wanted to share with you how much I learned from your thoughts about gender flexibility and gender transformation. You are really pushing my thinking forward with these notions … I won’t be able to look at the question of men in ECEC \[early childhood education and care\] without struggling myself with the task of conceptualising or reconceptualising what we are trying to accomplish here*’ \[S11\]. A day\-long training event in 2020 engaged 36 managers and policymakers with the ‘GenderEYE’ research, 82% of whom now understand why a gender\-diverse workforce is important in the early years \[S12\]. 

 <ins>Secondary and</ins> <ins>higher education</ins> 

 Every year, tens of thousands of UK students engage with Jackson’s work through A\-level and GCSE sociology curricula \[S13\]. Her research on gender and laddism in schools \[R1\] has a long\-standing position on the AS and A\-level sociology syllabi of the main exam boards \(including AQA and OCR\) and is included in A\-level sociology textbooks \(e.g., Haralambos & Holborn, AQA A\-Level Sociology, 2018, and AQA\-approved A\-level textbook by Bown, Pountney and Maric, AQA A\-Level Sociology, 2015\). Jackson’s work is also core to GCSE level and is featured in the Eduqas\-endorsed GCSE sociology textbook \(Tivey and Davies, WJEC Eduqas GCSE Sociology, 2017\). The reach of Jackson’s research through the sociology curriculum is extensive:  [OfQual](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F391Nf2G&data=04%7C01%7Cc.jackson2%40lancaster.ac.uk%7Cf275e26f6b784dc338a808d8bd3c6569%7C9c9bcd11977a4e9ca9a0bc734090164a%7C0%7C0%7C637467414375094155%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=LaIxp7Aa%2F8RBjmC5MAeTACnlw2CBo35rUp%2BkRtXKDxY%3D&reserved=0) data \( [https://bit.ly/391Nf2G](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F391Nf2G&data=04%7C01%7Cc.jackson2%40lancaster.ac.uk%7Cf275e26f6b784dc338a808d8bd3c6569%7C9c9bcd11977a4e9ca9a0bc734090164a%7C0%7C0%7C637467414375094155%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=LaIxp7Aa%2F8RBjmC5MAeTACnlw2CBo35rUp%2BkRtXKDxY%3D&reserved=0)\) show that in 2019 there were 7,415 AS and 36,965 A\-level sociology exam entries and 38,355 social science GCSE entries, which approximates to over 500,000 students over the REF period. Due to the centrality of Jackson’s work to sociology AS and A\-level exams, she was interviewed in April 2020 for a  [Sociology Show podcast](http://bit.ly/2M2XhYm) \(http://bit.ly/2M2XhYm\) for sociology teachers and students \(which the producer reported was downloaded 392 times within the first 10 weeks\). Her research is thus shaping and enhancing 14 to 18\-year\-old sociology students’ understandings of the ways that gender impacts young people’s experiences of, and approaches to, schooling.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The provision across the whole of Scotland, for the first time in any country, of a system able to deliver in real\-time **integrated** information, 24/7, about buried apparatus/infrastructure. Launched in 2012, with impact on: 

-  street workers: enhancing safety and operational efficiency 

-  streetworks planning: instant, customized, integrated vectorised maps 

-  utility companies and associated contractors: efficiency savings by faster and digital delivery of pre\-integrated information \(and thus potentially on utility consumers\) and the public, as emergency works may be effected faster, leading to fewer delays to journeys. 

-  policy of the Greater London Authority, and the Geospatial Commission \(part of the Cabinet Office\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A requirement under Health and Safety regulations is that on\-site workers undertaking excavations have current information about what lies beneath a road to help prevent injuries \(e.g. from electrocution or gas explosions\). 

 Emergency work may be required 24/7, so fast access to information can be crucial.  At the planning stage of works, this information is also vital, allowing utilities and road authorities to optimise their designs. 

 Traditionally, underground apparatus information is provided in a variety of formats including:   emailed pdf maps; CDs containing Geographic Information System \(GIS\) data; paper plans; individual company web sites. 

 Although GIS are now commonplace for the storage of underground assets data, information about what and how it is stored varies considerably across organisations.  There have been previous initiatives to try to standardise this information in the UK and develop an integrated records system; however, all of these failed to deliver. 

 In 2004 Cohn attended an EPSRC ‘Ideas Factory’/Sandpit on “Mapping the Underworld” \(MTU\). As a result, Leeds received funding \(EP/C014707/1, GBP158,437\) to research and develop a prototype system able to deliver integrated utility information – a real challenge considering the large number of utilities and variety of data recording practices. Further DTI/TSB \(now Innovate UK\) funding \(Project 5820, VISTA, GBP629,793 to Leeds\) broadened the scope \(Nottingham also received VISTA funding for an entirely separate subproject\).   Several successful technology trials were held, including two in Scotland at the invitation of the Scottish Road Works Register \(SRWR\). They already had a simpler system which allowed users to request maps from companies, but this could take weeks and data integration was left to the end user to be done manually.  A company called Symology ran this platform and received SRWR funding for the two trials \(Perth and Kinross; Tayforth\); Symology subcontracted Leeds \(GBP14,000\)\[A\] to provide the VISTA technology for this purpose.  The trials were successful and SRWR decided to implement a system \(subsequently called Vault\) based on this technology across all Scotland  \-\- demo:  [www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncK0nsDo\_gQ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncK0nsDo_gQ). 

 Each organisation’s pipes or cables are held as a separate layer and can be displayed to show the all the pipes and cables or only those of a specific domain \(electricity, water etc\) as required.  Other information such as proposed works can also be accessed as individual layers. 

 The main challenge which this research had to address was the heterogeneity across the sector \(both schema\-level and taxonomically\). This was solved with the industry\-validated design of the global schema and taxonomy, and the design of the rule\-set which automatically translates from individual company databases to the integrated system. 

 Symology confirm \[B\] that “the key principles that were taken from the VISTA research were: 

-  *“Establishing a single data schema for apparatus across all domains of Gas, Electricity, Water, Sewer, Telecoms*. \[1,3,5\] 

-  *Translating from heterogenous datasets into a single homogenous dataset.* \[1,3,5\] 

-  *Using a thesaurus\-based approach to harmonise industry terms from different asset owners into a single set for presentation to the end\-user* \[2,4\]” 

 also saying that “during the 10 years of operation there has been no questioning about the validity of \[the\] schema” and that adding a new utility now usually takes about a day of staff time. 

 Vault won two awards: 

1.  IET Innovation Awards 2012\(Built Environment category\), and “Highly Commended” in the IT category**Footnote:**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 We describe, in turn, two kinds of impact: 

1.  The Vault system which has been securely delivering integrated real\-time underground asset information across Scotland throughout the REF period. 

1.  Policy impact on the Greater London Authority HADES project which built directly on Vault. Vault and HADES then led to a policy impact on the Geospatial Commission, which is building a nationwide system, NUAR \(National Underground Assets Register\). 

1.  <ins> **The</ins> <ins>Vault</ins> <ins>system**</ins> 

 Vault went live in 2012**Footnote:**

 Vault launch press release from SRWC:  [webarchive.nrscotland.gov.uk/20180403091034/http://www.roadworksscotland.gov.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=969&sID=446](https://webarchive.nrscotland.gov.uk/20180403091034/http://www.roadworksscotland.gov.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=969&sID=446) 
– the Scottish Road Works Commissioner said: *“an excellent example of collaboration with Scottish utility companies and roads authorities working closely with partners from Leeds University, \[…\] to take research work \[…\]  and turn it into a world leading working system.”  “Vault came about as a direct result of the VISTA project”*\[B, also confirmed in C\].  “ *The Vault initiative … is an example of best practice*”\(Network Rail\)\[E:a\].  See §2 for awards won in 2012. 

 <ins>Summary of impact:</ins> 

-  the supply of utility records across Scotland has been transformed owing to real\-time, 24/7 integrated, vectorised, query\-able data, via a secure web interface; 

-  improved efficiency of back office planning owing to instant integrated vectorised records; 

-  improved safety of streetworkers owing to instant information for emergency works; 

-  improved efficiency and speed of operations, as records provision is automated rather than manually extracted from each individual asset owner’s records, and manually integrated; 

-  records are presented in a uniform way, irrespective of the source, providing more comprehensible information with reduced likelihood of misinterpretation causing negative safety impact; 

-  impact on the public owing to more efficient roadworks, and reduced likelihood of third\-party strikes**Footnote:**

 I.e. accidentally damaging a utility from a different owner to the one being worked on. 
\(which typically result in service outage for consumers\); 

-  improved efficiency for utilities as satisfying record requests from third parties is automated. 

 *“This was a world first and has been hailed by users in Scotland as a huge step forward, saving both time and money for all the road works community and now enshrined in Scottish legislation”*\[D\]. One daily utility user describes it as “ *An essential tool in the planning process of our programme of works*”\[C\]. 

 “*The apparatus database contains over 13,000,000 features, with 57 different organisations submitting data on a 2\-monthly update cycle. The apparatus database contains data from all Water, Electricity and Gas companies, a variety of Telecoms and Multi\-Utility companies and all Scottish Road Authorities*. *…it has been used by over 500 unique users across 60 different organisations and on a daily basis there are usually 150\-200 unique users accessing the system…* *Whilst these statistics reflect the most recent usage, the levels have been consistent since day one of live implementation … The system is available 24/7/365 thus facilitating out of hours usage…Lastly, as a result of the success of the Vault project, the Scottish Road Works Commissioner was keen to ensure that this carries on in the future. As a result, Section 119 of the Transport \(Scotland\) Act 2019 contains provision to make submission of apparatus data to Vault mandatory for asset owners*”\[B\].  “ *There is also now a Vault mobile system which allows for urgent and out of hours access to the information within, arising from the need for such a service being strongly communicated through the roadworks community in Scotland*”\[C\] – this would have been impossible without the Vault system enabled by Leeds’ research. The Health and Safety department of Scottish Gas Networks notes that “ *Surveyors do not always have underground plant details – \[Vault gives\] them all plant information, at the proposed location as well as alternatives that can be checked while onsite, removing the need for multiple visits, saving travel, cost and making the process more efficient*” and that “ *Remedial works do not always have underground plant details, especially reactive works – \[Vault\] makes works safer and quicker to carry out*”, with estimated savings of more than 500 hours p.a. in administration time alone\[I\]. 

 The cost of running Vault annually amounted to GBP850K in 19/20 which was paid for by subscriptions from the asset owners\[B\]. 

 There are no figures for societal costs caused by roadwork delays across Scotland, but an estimated figure from a government commissioned report in 2004 for England is GBP4.3B**Footnote:**

 [www.ukpopulation.org/scotland\-population/](http://www.ukpopulation.org/scotland-population/) 
; extrapolated to Scotland on the basis of population, this would equate to GBP423M \(or GBP655.4M if uprated using Bank of England inflation figures\). If Vault only reduced costs by 1% that would still save the Scotland at least GBP4.23M \(GBP6.55M if  uprated\) annually  in addition to the direct savings to the utilities. Moreover, the true costs \(including all indirect, e.g. social costs\) are 29 times larger than the direct cost of making good a utility strike\[G\]; thus any contribution to avoiding utility strikes because of the easier and faster access to integrated maps has a very large effect \-\- e.g. the 16 case studies alone in \[G\] have a total cost of GBP1.75M – whilst in 2017\-18 it has been calculated  by  [www.utilitystrikeavoidancegroup.org](http://www.utilitystrikeavoidancegroup.org/) that the *direct*  cost of *reported* strikes across the UK as GBP7M, and the average true cost of each utility strike is over GBP100,000**Footnote:**

 [www.utilitystrikeavoidancegroup.org/uploads/1/3/6/6/13667105/usag\_201718\_report\_final.pdf](http://www.utilitystrikeavoidancegroup.org/uploads/1/3/6/6/13667105/usag_201718_report_final.pdf) 
. 

 “ *It is difficult to convey to those not involved in the daily activity of working in the street to maintain highway and utility assets, the importance of the VISTA project and the subsequent implementation in Scotland. It has truly transformed the ways of working, dramatically improved safety for operatives and streamlined the design of projects to install or replace new utility assets in the street*”\[D\]. 

 <ins> **2\) Policy impact:**</ins> 

 There is impact on the rest of the UK utility sector. Cohn was invited to join the steering committee of an initiative in London coordinated by the Greater London Authority \(GLA\) called BIM\-VAULT, or HADES, \(Highways Asset Data Exchange System\) with funding of GBP66K from the London Lane Rental Fund, to implement a Vault\-like system\[H\]. On Cohn’s recommendation, Symology was chosen as the implementation partner, and the trial successfully replicated Vault technology and benefits \[D,H\]. HADES was “Highly Commended” for the UKSTT 2019 Awards \(Application of Digital Technology category\). 

 Vault/MTU/VISTA has influenced Project Iceberg**Footnote:**

 Iceberg partners: British Geological Survey\(BGS\), Connected Places Catapult and the Ordnance Survey. 
which “ *aims to address the serious issue of the lack of information about the ground beneath our cities and the un\-coordinated way in which the subsurface space is managed*”, saying “ *Vault’s success validates the need for a similar platform in the UK and can be leveraged for Iceberg’s development and commercialisation*”\[E:b\] 

 Based on Project Iceberg, and HADES/Vault success, in April 2019, the Geospatial Commission announced a **national** initiative, NUAR\[E:c\] to ensure that all buried utilities in the UK are digitally mapped. As part of their initial planning they noted\[E:d\] that *“…Scotland has a working system called Vault managed by the Scottish Roadworks Commissioner. We have spent considerable time engaging with the teams who have built these systems*”.  The initial phase of NUAR involved 2 pilots, with total available government funding of GBP3.9M\[E:c\], with London/HADES being one of these \(LUAR –London Underground Assets Register\), showing a clear influence on the Geospatial Commission and national policy: “ *LUAR builds on.. HADES,’ a proof of concept that created a similar map*”\[E:e\].  LUAR was tested on 150 users using assets from \~25 organisations\[E:f\] .“ *Currently, different organisations have their own maps showing where such things as gas pipes and electricity cables are, but the lack of a combined map creates an increased risk of potentially lethal accidents*”\[E:e\].  Cohn is on the NUAR Advisory Group\[E:f, J\] and contributed ontologies and data models from the VISTA system.  NUAR was one of the 2019 top\-3 finalists for the “Cross Sector Digital Collaboration of the Year”\[F\]. Feedback from the NUAR pilot is very encouraging\[E:f\]: “ *the creation of a job pack was reduced from 1 hour 30 minutes to just 7 minutes*”; “ *a Civils Manager stated that as a high level estimate they could save up to GBP1M per year just on streamlining the planning process for obtaining utility plans*”; “ *From a safety perspective you cannot put a price on this – it’s absolutely amazing”* \(Team Leader, Northumbrian Water Group\). This feedback thus also provides additional evidence on the savings that have been being achieved in Vault across Scotland. The NUAR pilot has been a “ *resounding success*”\[H\].  A Geospatial Commission report \(24/11/20\) states they are “ *committed to preparing for a national roll\-out of a National Underground Assets Register*” \(NUAR\)”\[E:g\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research \(ICR\) discovered and led the clinical development of the prostate cancer drug abiraterone, leading to impact on: 

-  **Clinical policy.** Between 2011 and 2018, abiraterone was approved in combination with prednisone/prednisolone in 105 countries. 

-  **Patients.** Abiraterone has transformed the care of prostate cancer. More than 500,000 men worldwide will have received treatment with abiraterone. It is estimated that this has given them >300,000 extra life years. 

-  **The pharmaceutical industry.** From 2014 to 2019, Johnson & Johnson reported total abiraterone sales of over USD15,500,000,000.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **The discovery of abiraterone.** Since the 1940s, it has been known that prostate cancers rely on testosterone \(an androgen\) to grow. Up until the 1990s, therapies therefore focussed on trying to block the action of the hormone. Ultimately, however, most patients’ cancers stopped responding to these treatments. Many at the time believed that this was a result of the cancer evolving to survive without testosterone—but the ICR’s Professor Mike Jarman, Dr Elaine Barrie, and Professor Gerry Potter posed an alternative theory—that these cancers remained dependent on testosterone and were getting a supply of testosterone from elsewhere in the body, and therefore the disruption of testosterone synthesis could still be an effective treatment. In the early 1990s, this team discovered a compound which specifically and irreversibly blocked CYP17, an enzyme required for androgen production. Working with the British Technology Group \(BTG\), the ICR team further developed this compound, called abiraterone. 

 **The first clinical trials of abiraterone.** The next stage was to assess abiraterone in a clinical trial. In the early 2000s, the first phase 1 trial of abiraterone was conducted by Professor Ian Judson at the ICR’s partner hospital, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust \(RM\), in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. This trial established that administration of abiraterone acetate \(the prodrug of abiraterone\) suppressed testosterone generation in patients with prostate cancer and most importantly showed the drug was safe in humans **\(Ref. 1\)**. However, Boehringer Ingelheim decided not to continue developing abiraterone at this point. 

 Several years later, the ICR’s Professor Johann de Bono, working with Cougar Biotech, judged there was potential in abiraterone and led a series of trials demonstrating the effectiveness of the drug. Professor Johann de Bono then initiated a phase 1/2 trial of abiraterone with prednisone. Prednisone serves as glucocorticoid replacement therapy and reduces adverse effects. Evaluation of once\-daily continuous abiraterone, established abiraterone’s safety and revealed impressive tumour shrinkage and major falls in Prostate Specific Antigen \(PSA\) levels in the majority of the 21 patients \(each with advanced prostate cancer who had previously received multiple lines of hormone therapy\) **\(Ref. 2\)**. This trial confirmed that late\-stage prostate cancer \(known as metastatic castration\-resistant prostate cancer, mCRPC\) is still hormone driven, and therefore pharmacological intervention on hormone synthesis or hormone action could benefit patients. This trial also showed that up to 70% of men with advanced prostate cancer responded to abiraterone. Two\-thirds of men experienced significant benefits for an average of 8 months, with their PSA levels declining and scans showing that their tumours had decreased in size **\(Ref. 3\)**. 

 **Practice\-changing clinical trial.** A randomised double\-blind phase 3 trial of abiraterone acetate \(Chief Investigator \(CI\): Professor de Bono\) was initiated in 2008, involving 1,195 patients in 147 sites over 13 countries. The patients in this trial all had mCRPC, and had previously been treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The overall results of this study showed that treatment with abiraterone led to a 35% reduction in the risk of death **\(Ref. 4\)**. Patients treated with abiraterone also had consistently improved pain palliation as compared with those in the placebo group. These data led to approval by various regulatory authorities \(see *Section 4*\). This pivotal phase 3 trial showed increased overall survival in the abiraterone acetate–prednisone group than in the placebo–prednisone group \(14.8 months vs. 10.9 months\). 

 **Additional clinical benefits of abiraterone.** Further trials showed benefit of abiraterone therapy at earlier stages of prostate cancer. In the COU\-AA\-302 trial, in which Professor de Bono was a co\-investigator, abiraterone improved progression\-free survival in patients with mCRPC who had not had chemotherapy, showed a trend toward improved overall survival, and significantly delayed clinical decline and initiation of chemotherapy **\(Ref. 5\)**. The STAMPEDE trial involved 1,917 men with newly diagnosed \(or relapsed\) advanced prostate cancer, with 957 randomly assigned to standard of care alone \(ADT, androgen\-deprivation therapy\) and 960 to ADT, abiraterone acetate, and prednisolone \(combination therapy\). The use of the combination therapy as compared with ADT alone was associated with a 71% relative improvement in the time to treatment failure, which translated into a 37% increase in overall survival **\(Ref. 6\)**. This provides the initial evidence that the use of abiraterone as a first\-line therapy in men who are initiating long\-term ADT could improve survival.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Regulatory approvals of abiraterone.** In April 2011, based on the data from the ICR\-led COU\-AA\-301 phase 3 trial **\(Ref. 4\)**, the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) licensed abiraterone acetate for the treatment of men with mCRPC who have received prior docetaxel chemotherapy. After accelerated regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\), abiraterone was approved for use in Europe **\[A\]**, and approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) in June 2012. In the NICE approval it was estimated approximately 2,500 patients in England and Wales with mCRPC would benefit from the marketing authorisation of abiraterone **\[B\]**. 

 In 2012 and 2013 respectively, FDA and EMA approval was extended to the treatment of mCRPC in men who have not received standard chemotherapy. NICE approved this indication in 2016 and it was estimated that approximately 7,000 patients would be eligible for this therapy in England alone **\[C\]**. These approvals were based on the COU\-AA\-302 trial **\(Ref. 5\)**. 

 The phase 3 trial, LATITUDE \(NCT01715285\), involving 1,199 patients across 34 countries, showed there was a clear benefit to using abiraterone in combination with androgen\-deprivation therapy as a first\-line treatment for advanced prostate cancer, providing further support for the results seen in the STAMPEDE trial **\(Ref. 6\)**. Following publication of these results in 2017, abiraterone, in combination with androgen\-deprivation therapy, was approved by the EMA as a first\-line treatment for advanced prostate cancer **\[D\]**. In 2018, this indication was approved by the FDA **\[E\]**. This was the first approval in metastatic castration\-sensitive prostate cancers, thus providing improved therapy options for a new group of patients. 

 **Patient impact.** Based on GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates, 1,276,106 new cases of prostate cancer were reported worldwide in 2018. Moreover, more than 358,000 men worldwide died from the disease in 2018—3.8% of all cancer\-related deaths in men **\[F\]**. In addition the work of the ICR has changed the nomenclature in the field—patients that were called hormone refractory \(because it was thought their tumours would no longer respond to testosterone\) are now said to have castration\-resistant prostate cancer. 

 The ICR\-led COU\-AA\-301 phase 3 trial **\(Ref. 4\)** showed that, in patients where the standard therapies had failed, administration of abiraterone acetate with prednisone resulted in a 35% reduction in the risk of death compared to the placebo with prednisone. Therefore, abiraterone is prolonging the survival of patients worldwide receiving this treatment. The NICE approval in 2012 highlighted the patient benefit of abiraterone: 

 “*The Committee concluded that abiraterone offers a step change in treatment because it is an oral drug taken by patients at home, and is associated with few adverse reactions.”… “The Committee heard from the patient experts that the most important benefits of abiraterone were extension to life and improved quality of life, including less pain and improved mental and physical health.”* **\[B\]** 

 The COU\-AA\-302 trial **\(Ref. 5\)** led to the regulatory approval above, and therefore resulting in mCRPC patients worldwide being treated with abiraterone, before treatment with chemotherapy. In the 2016 NICE approval, it was highlighted: 

 “*…that chemotherapy can reduce a person's quality of life and that treatments delaying the need for chemotherapy are highly valued by patients.”* **\[C\]** 

 Patient benefit, as seen in trials and described above, has been on a global scale. Between 2011 and 2018, treatment with abiraterone in combination with prednisone/prednisolone was approved in 105 countries. More than 500,000 men worldwide have received treatment with abiraterone **\[G\]**. It is estimated that this has given >300,000 extra life years to men suffering from prostate cancer. Data from the UK showed that prescription of abiraterone increased in 2012 after the NICE approval **\[B\]** to approximately 250,000 daily doses by 2014 \(see *Figure 1*, adapted from the NICEimpact cancer report **\[H\]**\). During the COVID\-19 pandemic, NHS England made abiraterone available as a first\-line treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer \(who are intolerant to enzaluamide\), in order to lower the risk of exposing these vulnerable patients to the SARS\-CoV\-2 virus—patients can take their tablets at home and have their bloods checked by their General Practitioner, and, unlike chemotherapy, abiraterone has no significant effects on the patients’ immune system. 

 **Economic impact for the pharmaceutical industry.** The clinical development of abiraterone \(trade name Zytiga®\) has led to significant economic impact in the pharmaceutical sector. During the development of the drug, ICR researchers have worked with BTG, Cougar Biotechnology, Inc and Johnson & Johnson, all of which have greatly benefited commercially. Cougar Biotechnology, Inc was acquired in 2009 by Johnson & Johnson. BTG, acquired by Boston Scientific in 2019, receives licensing royalties from abiraterone—these amounted to GBP155,400,000 in 2017/18, up from GBP123,200,000 the previous year **\[I\]**. Johnson & Johnson reported sales of almost USD2,800,000,000 of abiraterone in 2019. In annual report data from 2014 to 2019, Johnson & Johnson reported total abiraterone sales of over USD15,500,000,000 **\[J\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research examining the role and value of online education in Higher Education \(HE\) and the design and pedagogy of massive open online courses \(MOOCs\) has informed digital education policy development in the UK, South Africa and other countries, and shaped UK government initiatives to improve access, inclusion and digital skills. This sustained and substantial programme of research by Morris and Swinnerton has impacted on strategic direction through decision\-makers in universities and companies supporting widened HE access, and resulted in changes to the design and delivery of online education provision for learners around the world. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In 2012, the *New York Times* declared the ‘ [Year of the MOOC](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html)’ and advocates promised that massive open online courses would democratise education and offer access to learning opportunities for disadvantaged individuals globally. Research led by Morris, a world\-leading expert in digital education, examined the impact of the growth of online learning on universities and the HE sector by investigating online learning from the perspectives of a range of stakeholders, including learners, instructors and course designers. The research responded to increasing use of digital technology and online education, providing much needed empirical evidence about the impact of digital technology on learning, learners, teaching and teachers. Over time, the research widened to consider national and international perspectives, focusing on global educational practice and policy\-making by government and institutional decision\-makers. In particular, the research has examined the development of online education at a time of marketisation and the emergence of the phenomenon of unbundling of educational provision, revealing existing inequalities in access to digital education. The research developed from initial work in 2012 by Morris and Swinnerton, who have led throughout and fostered collaborations with colleagues from Leeds \(via the Centre for Research in Digital Education, which focuses on digital technology in HE and the workplace\), and nationally and internationally. Findings have been reported in articles \(12\), conference papers \(15\+\), a book chapter, reports \(2\), policy pamphlets \(3\), blog articles \(5\), websites \(2\) and a course delivered on a global online learning platform. 

 **Research in online education informing educational strategy, decision\-making and policy:** An ESRC Newton\-funded project \(2016\-18\) **\[a\]** led by Morris \(with Swinnerton, and the University of Cape Town\), investigated the factors influencing changes in HE as a result of marketisation, digital technology and the unbundling of teaching and learning provision. Unbundling is the disaggregation of educational provision into its component parts, e.g. a degree programme offered as individual standalone modules for credit on an online platform, which often develops through a partnership with a commercial partner, and has accelerated as a result of digital technology and marketisation. This research revealed and explained the tensions between universities’ core business of serving the public good and the commercial aspects of the growth of online education within universities, and showed the stratified and unequal nature of partnerships between universities and private companies, which has significance for the global HE sector. Using a novel interactive mapping methodology, Swinnerton et al found that private companies favoured partnering with the historically advantaged and elite highly ranked universities, whilst neglecting the lower ranked disadvantaged universities, which dispelled the view that all universities had equal access to such activity **\[1\]**. Research by Morris et al identified key strategic drivers influencing leaders’ and managers’ decisions about upscaling online education, and identified the conflicting positions of leaders, staff and students in universities, demonstrating the challenges of growth and diversification of online courses in a marketised higher education sector **\[2\]**. 

 **Research on the design and delivery of online courses informing educational practice:** Early MOOCs were considered an opportunity to widen access for non\-traditional groups of students. A novel and timely study by Morris et al, conducted as MOOCs were growing rapidly globally, challenged the extent of widening participation, by establishing the demographics of online learners using these courses **\[3\]**. The study of 27,000 learners found that older, non\-working learners, with prior experience of online education and a high prior educational attainment, were more likely to complete a MOOC, contrary to assumptions about MOOCs widening access for those otherwise unable to study. Low completion rates characterised MOOCs from the outset and led to a focus on the relationship between engagement of learners and attrition. In another large\-scale novel study, Swinnerton et al analysed data from over 25,000 learners to explore the relationship between commenting in discussion areas and completing a FutureLearn MOOC. FutureLearn’s underpinning pedagogy emphasises social learning and the importance of online conversation, thus placing this research as key to understanding the impact of this pedagogy. It found that only those learners who post multiple comments \(‘superposters’\) are more likely to complete a MOOC, whilst commenting infrequently had no impact on completion; and that most learners did not comment at all or only commented once or twice, leading to increased attention in the design process to engage learners in online discussion **\[4\]**. To further inform engagement and learning in MOOCs, Morris and Swinnerton’s doctoral student \(Goshtasbpour\) examined the role of instructors in MOOCs, providing theoretical insights about online interactions between learners and instructors, resulting in an extension of the Community of Inquiry theoretical framework to evaluate MOOCs. This research also provided practical insights about the design of online courses, and the training needed for online teachers to facilitate learning in discussions **\[5\]**. Cross\-institutional research between leading MOOC researchers at the Universities of Leeds, Birmingham, Edinburgh and the Open University \(lead\) demonstrated that MOOC learner engagement is related to the inclusion of discussion or assessment within the course design, and the length of the course, with important practical impacts on the use of the FutureLearn MOOC platform, particularly in terms of the optimal length of online courses **\[6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has benefited learners, educators, digital course designers, and policymakers at institutional, company and national levels through impacts on: i\) education strategy and policy, and \(ii\) pedagogy and design of online courses. 

 **\(i\) Impact on education strategy and policy at national and international level** 

 Morris’s expertise in digital education has led to invitations to contribute to influential committees and working groups. For example, a research presentation resulted in Morris being invited to sit on a UK governmental committee \(Research Working Group on Digital Skills and Inclusion, Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport/Department for Education; 2018\-current\) to help support the Government’s attempts to improve inclusion and digital skills amongst the UK population, in particular through the increased use of online education and MOOCs. Following publication of the research, Morris was also invited to join and present research at two national Jisc committees \(the organisation for digital services in HE and further education\), and contribute to its  [outputs:](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/new-initiative-will-support-universities-as-they-continue-to-transform-learning-and-teaching-11-aug-2020) \(i\) Senior TEL Working Group \(2016\-current\), and \(ii\)  [Horizon Group](http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/7284/1/horizons-report-spring-2019.pdf) \(2018\-current\), directly influencing the Government’s attempts to embed greater use of digital technology in the HE sector to improve access, learning outcomes and experience. The ‘Unbundled University’ project **\[a\]** \(2016\-18\) has had impact on debates about policy and practice in both the UK and South Africa, the two centres of data collection, as well as more widely, and in particular on the global debate about the future of HE, including coverage in national media \(e.g.  [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36378572)\). The findings from this research project, and the related publications allowed Morris to respond quickly at a time of crisis. During the initial height of the COVID\-19 pandemic, Morris was regularly consulted for his expert opinion by the media \(e.g. quotes in four  [*Guardian*](https://crde.leeds.ac.uk/news/morris-talks-about-online-education-in-national-news/) articles during March/April 2020\), and was asked to summarise the Unbundled University policy findings in a Higher Education Policy Institute \( [HEPI](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2020/04/29/scaling-up-online-education-more-haste-less-speed/)\) blog post distributed to over 10,000 education professionals, directly accessed around 1,000 times and included in a Quality Assurance Association for HE \( [QAA](https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/guidance/admissions-and-transitions.pdf?sfvrsn=5784cc81_6)\) guidance document issued to all UK HE providers. Both Morris and Czerniewicz \(South African PI on **\[a\]**\) have contributed to international events and Government policy discussions via over 20 invitations, and two flagship impact events \(one in the UK and one in SA\). The research has changed university leaders’ and managers’ strategic views about the future of their online education offer. For example, the Director of University of Manchester Worldwide explains: *‘Morris’ presentation is being regarded as a turning point for the University of Manchester. Neil’s thought provoking presentation and ensuing discussion … had a significant impact on the University of Manchester’s thinking with regards to technology enabled lifelong and flexible learning...* *the most significant project that came forth as a result of Neil’s keynote is the development of a completely unbundled/stackable suite of courses and course units with our Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health’* **\[A\]**. A presentation at King’s College London, including findings about learner perceptions and preferences in relation to online provision, resulted in policy changes at the College concerning online programme fees and education practice in online communities, as described by the Executive Director of Online and Professional Education: *‘The research on the Unbundled University, presented … in September 2018, had an impact on how we set fees for our programmes... it was stated that a survey* \[from the research study\] *had revealed that the strongest motivating factor in taking an online course was reduced cost. We have therefore taken this into account, amongst other factors, when reviewing what the price point of a new course should be’* **\[B\]**. Online educational provision developed in partnership with private companies can follow several models. The unbundling research has enabled institutions to negotiate with commercial providers from an informed and therefore stronger position. For example, the research was ‘ *instrumental’* for the University of Bristol in shaping its online education strategy, as its University Education Director \(Online and Blended Learning\) describes: ‘ *The University … is planning to make a significant and rapid expansion into credit\-bearing, fee\-paying courses and programmes. Central to this has been the outputs from the Unbundled University research programme, run by the University of Leeds and Cape Town… The insight from the research has therefore helped us to moderate some of the assertions of the benefits of partnership made by some potential commercial providers, allowing us to make better informed decisions on approach, ultimately leading to more sustainable and better quality online courses*’ **\[C\]**. 

 An online course about the research delivered through the FutureLearn platform attracted over 1,500 participants \(including policymakers, university managers, edubusiness leaders\) from over 65 countries, who described changes in their attitudes and behaviours as a result of the course. The online course and a presentation about the research at Leiden University in the Netherlands led to the development of a partnership between the University and FutureLearn to deliver unbundled educational provision. The Program Manager in Digital Learning at Leiden University explains: *‘… colleagues of Leiden University have taken the MOOC on Unbundling and organized an internal discussion session about the subject …* *The online course and a presentation about the research findings at Leiden University was a significant contributing factor leading to a partnership between the University and FutureLearn’* **\[D\]**. 

 The findings were also welcomed by the largest global education publisher and provider, Pearson Education, who have referred to them in support of their strategic focus, in particular their increased development of unbundled educational provision, and partnerships between education providers and employers. Vice\-President for University Partnerships at Pearson Education states: *‘The research findings influenced our decisions to proceed with the development of UK Learns, a marketplace for learners to find employment focused learning experiences that can be linked together in order to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for further employment ... It further supports our beliefs about the direction the market is traveling with regard to the demand for alternative credentialing’* **\[E\]**. Similarly, the global social learning platform FutureLearn used the research to support its unbundling strategy: ‘ *Morris’ research on unbundling of online learning has been instrumental to us at FutureLearn in terms of delivering our strategy for micro\-credentials and stackable online degrees*’ \(CEO, FutureLearn **\[F\]**\). In addition, the CEO of Universities South Africa \(representing and advising the country’s universities\) states that the research forced them to *‘begin to think at least how as a sector we can begin to advise universities about the – both about the – kind of the opportunities and the, the risks associated with \[unbundling\]’* **\[G\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Impact on pedagogy and design of online courses** 

 The research on learner engagement and completion of online courses has been used extensively by the Digital Education Service at Leeds to inform the pedagogy, design and delivery of over 100 online courses, to emphasise learner engagement and encourage retention. In particular, the findings that MOOC completion is related to pedagogical approaches in course design, course duration and educator involvement led to the inclusion of specific learning focused discussions in online courses, which encourage learners to be more \(inter\)active, and educators being encouraged to adapt their behaviour towards learners. These courses have attracted over 2.2 million individuals from over 170 countries since 2013, many of whom have no access to formal education **\[F\]**. These research\-based design principles have resulted in higher than average satisfaction rates from participants on Leeds’s online courses, and Leeds’s courses on FutureLearn are considered sector\-leading and a template for others to follow **\[F\]**. The FutureLearn CEO describes how the research has impacted course design and learner engagement: *‘Leeds’ courses on digital skills, produced in partnership with the Institute of Coding and FutureLearn, have enrolled over 500,000 learners since March 2020, and these courses were designed based on research findings from Morris and colleagues, about the need to be inclusively designed, interactive and social, to engage the target audience of young BAME learners’* **\[F\]**. These courses were included in the UK Government’s Department for Education’s Skills Toolkit to support national digital skills training. To ensure learners gained from the outcomes of this research, Morris wrote a research\-informed ‘ [guide to studying MOOCs’](https://www.macmillanihe.com/resources/Product-Page-Downloads/M/Morris-Studying-a-MOOC/Studying-a-MOOC-Neil-Morris-James-Lambe.pdf) for learners, which was promoted to all FutureLearn learners in 2014\-15 \(downloaded over 10,000 times, 2014\-19\). 

 Morris has received significant external funding to design, develop and deliver online courses informed by the research relating to the design of online courses, their potential for CPD, and how to effectively engage learners online **\[3\-6\]**, for example, from the Goldman Sachs Foundation, Ufi Charitable Trust, and the Institute for Coding. The Ufi Charitable Trust project \(2015\-17, GBP450,000, with UCL; Morris Co\-Director\) developed four MOOCs \- Blended Learning Essentials \(BLE\) – to teach teachers, trainers and decision\-makers in the Vocational Education and Training \(VET\) sector about incorporating digital and online education into their curricula, with the specific aim to enhance practice in this sector in the light of significant funding cuts accompanied by requirements to increase use of digital technology. The Digital Skills course within this collection was endorsed by the UK Minister for Digital via an introductory video, commending the work to support digital skills in the VET sector: ‘ *There's lots of great work happening right across the country, including at UCL and the University of Leeds with the new Developing Digital Skills course*’ **\[H\]**. The BLE courses reached over 60,000 participants in the UK and internationally \(mostly teachers and trainers\), and the beneficiaries reported significant changes in teacher behaviour, colleges’ education strategy and views about blended learning **\[I\]**. The courses are regularly used by teacher trainers in universities and colleges. For example, a lecturer in post\-compulsory education at the University of Wolverhampton remarks: *‘The BLE courses provide insights into practical pedagogical methods underpinned by theoretical references ... The videos that share practice are clear to training teachers who may otherwise be daunted by the notion of using technologies ... They are valuable because they can see how the knowledge they have about teaching can be transferred and applied through technology’* **\[J\]**. Some participants on the BLE courses were interviewed \(anonymously\) as part of project evaluation and described how the courses impacted practice in colleges: *‘I have gained the confidence to use digital in the deployment of apprenticeship programmes. This is critical for me since one cannot deliver competitive results in today's training practice without digital’* and ‘ *we shouldn’t be reinventing the wheel all over the country … for me it was really quite a revelation’* \( **\[I\]** p.3\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study describes significant further impacts of the novel method that transformed exit\-polling at UK General Elections.  The context is that the underpinning research had already led to success in predicting the outcomes of the 2005 and 2010 General Elections, for broadcasters BBC, ITV and Sky.  In the period 2015 to 2019 the main additional impacts of the work were: 

-  The same method was used — unchanged, and again with great success — at three further UK General Elections \(in 2015, 2017 and 2019\), by a team working to produce exit polls for BBC, ITV and Sky for an audience of millions \(via TV, radio and the internet\). 

-  Due to the accuracy of the new method, trust in UK\-election exit polling grew substantially in the years 2015–2019, as was evident in the broadcasters' own coverage of the exit poll as well as in the wider media. A particular consequence of the increase in trust was that, at all of the three most recent elections, the 10pm close\-of\-polls movements of global financial markets were immediate and essentially complete, with major markets responding as if the 10pm exit\-poll prediction was the actual result of the election. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research was application\-specific statistical methodology, developed by Professor David Firth at the University of Warwick between October 2004 and February 2006.  The research work was carried out in preparation for the May 2005 General Election, and then continued over several months after that election with post\-election analytical work to assess the performance of the methods in detail. 

 Firth, together with Professor John Curtice of the University of Strathclyde \(Department of Government\), had been engaged by the BBC and ITV jointly to design and analyse their election\-day exit poll at the next General Election \(expected to take place in 2005 or 2006\). 

 A full account of the methodological development was published in 2008 in the jointly authored paper **\[3.1\]**, detailed below. 

 The Curtice & Firth \(2008\) paper **\[3.1\]** describes several strands of novel statistical methodology developed for use at the 2005 General Election, which would be the first time that BBC and ITV \(and their respective opinion\-polling partner companies, NOP and MORI\) were to combine resources to run an exit poll and produce a single forecast that would be broadcast by both organisations at 10pm on polling day.  The novel methods included, as the most important statistical ingredients: 

-  *Design* of the exit\-poll via a *panel* of polling stations \(drawn from those that had been used by NOP and MORI in their separate operations at the 2001 General Election\). 

-  *Modelling* of the exit\-poll data through multivariate regressions of electoral change. This included the detailed development and testing of a completely new, coherent approach to the treatment of multi\-party shares of the vote. 

-  Accurate *calibration* of constituency\-level probability forecasts through a new, non\-standard method with tuning constants determined through extensive experimentation with data from previous elections. 

 The methodological \(statistical\) research was all carried out by Firth. Curtice's role was to provide essential and detailed political and polling knowledge. 

 Firth's involvement in election\-night forecasting had begun in 1997 when he worked at the University of Oxford: at the 1997 and 2001 General Elections he served as assistant to the veteran psephologist Clive Payne, who retired as the BBC's statistical consultant on election forecasting after the 2001 election.  Early developments in some parts of the new methods of Curtice and Firth **\[3.1\]** were trialled at the 2001 election; the bulk of the research work, though, was done after Firth moved to Warwick on 1 October 2003 and was subsequently appointed by the BBC as Payne's successor to work on the 2005 election.

 **The background: Exit polls at UK General Elections since 2005** 

 The major UK broadcasters fund and organise an election\-day exit poll, in order to inform their coverage \(on TV, radio and internet\) on the night of the UK General Election, a time when current\-affairs broadcasting attracts large audiences.  For the election in 2005, David Firth as consultant for BBC developed \(with John Curtice\) a completely new method **\[3.1\]** for the exit poll, to improve the accuracy of the headline prediction made at 10pm on election night.  The method proved so successful in 2005 — with an *exact* prediction of the 66\-seat Labour majority — that it was adopted jointly by all of BBC, ITV and Sky for the following election in 2010.  After a similar success in 2010, the method has been used jointly by BBC, ITV and Sky at all subsequent general elections \(2015, 2017 and 2019\).  Corroborative statement **\[5.1\]**, written after the 2010 election by the then Editor of BBC Political Research, confirms the pre\-2015 background and emphasises the importance of the new method to the broadcasters. By 2010 Firth had moved on to other projects, and he passed the operation of the exit\-poll method and associated software to Jouni Kuha \(LSE\), who replaced Firth as the statistician in John Curtice's election\-day team at every General Election from 2010 to date. 

  

 **Fresh impact in 2015–2019** 

 The impacts described below are of two main kinds: 

1.  Impact of the underpinning research in conveying **timely and accurate information to a large worldwide audience**, via conventional media \(TV, radio, press\) and the internet. While this  kind of impact was previously generated in connection with the General Election of 2010; the impact between 2015 and 2019 is around three times as big since it relates to three further elections. 

1.  Additional impact via the public track\-record of accuracy of the new exit\-poll method since 2005, in the form of **substantially increased trust** in the exit poll and the 10pm election\-night prediction that comes from it. By 2019 the 10pm exit\-poll prediction was presented \(by broadcasters and other media outlets\) without the scepticism that had routinely accompanied such predictions previously \(in 2005 and 2010 for example\); and even *politicians* now typically accept the exit\-poll prediction as a reliable indication of the election outcome.   Moreover, the world's financial markets also now exhibit essentially 100% trust in the accuracy of the exit poll \(whereas previously, even as recently as 2010, the markets' response at 10pm to a surprising but ultimately accurate exit poll was rather more muted because exit polls back then were not trusted to be accurate\). 

 The Curtice\-Firth methodology developed in the underpinning research **\[3.1\]** was used unchanged, by a team of academics working jointly for the three major broadcasters \(BBC, ITV, Sky\), to design and analyse the **exit polls for the three General Elections in 2015, 2017 and 2019**. The corroborative statement in **\[5.2\]**, written in 2020 by Professor Jouni Kuha who is the statistician in the exit\-poll team led by Sir John Curtice, fully confirms this.  Kuha states straightforwardly: ""The methodology of the exit poll in all of these years has been the one which was developed by David Firth and John Curtice for the 2005 election, as described in Curtice and Firth \(JRSSA, 2008\).""  Kuha's statement letter also comments on the remarkable accuracy of exit\-poll predictions in the five elections between 2005 and 2019, and states that ""This success would … have been impossible without the current exit poll methodology.""  The article in **\[5.2\]** by Curtice, Kuha and other exit\-poll team members, published after the 2017 election, gives a more detailed account. 

 The broadcasters \(BBC, ITV and Sky\) disseminate their exit\-poll prediction to the whole world at 10pm on election day via TV, radio and the internet.  In the UK alone, the number of BBC1 viewers at 10pm on each election night exceeds 6,000,000, according to reports **\[5.3\]** on the 2015, 2017 and 2019 elections from the BBC and Press Gazette; the corresponding number of viewers on ITV and Sky is reported to be 1–2 million.  The exit poll's global reach via the internet is not measured but is very substantial: the exit\-poll prediction is picked up immediately by news media across the world, and by global financial markets.  The background letter **\[5.1\]** indicates the high value that the BBC and other broadcasters attach to the exit poll.  According to paragraph 29 of the 2018 report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Political Polling and Digital Media \(in **\[5.3\]**\), the cost of running the exit poll at a General Election is around GBP300,000 — a figure which further corroborates the high value that the broadcasters attach to the exit poll. 

 Interest in the exit poll from the general public is strong \(as indicated by the quoted audience figures, for example\), and there is evidence that the public at large now appreciates that modern\-day \(""John Curtice""\) exit polls are much more reliable than pre\-election polls.  Evidence **\[5.4\]** collects some representative social\-media posts from members of the public in December 2019, e.g., "" *There is only one poll to trust and it's the exit poll*"".  From these social media posts, it seems also that the exit poll influences individual behaviour, for example the decision to stay up on election night: typical tweets include "" *No point \- exit poll is always right*"", "" *I didn't sleep a wink on referendum night. Wouldn't have missed it for the world. I don't bother on General Election nights though. I trust John Curtice enough to watch the exit poll and get off to bed*"" and "" *JC's exit poll is normally bang on, at 10pm tomorrow I'll know whether to go to bed early*"". 

 To support wider understanding of the exit poll and its methods, David Firth created \(in 2010\) the public\-facing ""Exit Poll Explainer"" page at  [warwick.ac.uk/exitpolling](https://warwick.ac.uk/exitpolling) — which sees thousands of visits around the time of an election \(access statistics **\[5.5\]** show more than 15,000 distinct visitors in the week of the 2017 election, for example\).  Sir David Spiegelhalter, then President of the Royal Statistical Society, highlighted the *Explainer* page along with this public comment **\[5.6\]** immediately after the 2017 election: "" *Clear outright winners of this election \(and others\): statisticians who designed the exit poll and its model*"".  In his 2019 popular book *The Art of Statistics*, Spiegelhalter even highlighted Firth's work on exit\-poll methodology as the book's final chapter "" *An Example of Good Statistical Science*"". 

 In all three of the most recent elections \(2015, 2017, 2019\) the exit poll's prediction was markedly different from what had been expected from pre\-election polls \(as indeed it had been also in 2010 and 2005\).  Whereas in 2010 the surprising exit poll was downplayed by TV broadcasters and on\-air pundits \(as noted also in **\[5.1\]**\), by 2017 its track\-record of accuracy had forced the commentators and politicians to accept the 10pm exit poll as a reliable prediction of the election outcome.  Evidence **\[5.7\]** collects some media items which show this.  Even in 2015, former LibDem leader Paddy Ashdown rubbished the exit poll in his interview on BBC1 and famously said he would eat his hat on TV if his party lost the large number of seats that the exit poll had predicted \(their actual loss was two seats *more* than the prediction\).  By 2017, though, the tone had changed markedly towards acceptance of the exit poll's accuracy.  In her BBC interview a few weeks after the 2017 election, PM Theresa May admits to having been ""shocked...devastated"" upon hearing the exit poll that signalled the loss of her House of Commons majority.  By 2019 we even see John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, conceding the election on BBC1 just 15 minutes after the 10pm exit poll has been announced.  Whereas in 2015 *The Independent* still asks "" *Just how did the exit poll manage to get it so right?*"", in 2019 *The Economist* reports simply that "" *Britain's exit poll has an exceptional record*"". 

 In the peer\-reviewed paper **\[5.8\]**, written after the 2017 election and published in one of the most prominent international journals of political science, the evidence just described is solidified through formal text\-analysis of election\-night broadcasts across UK general elections since 1955.  Paper **\[5.8\]** provides many new insights, and a key conclusion is that "" *The remarkable accuracy of the 2010 exit poll, and the subsequent success of the 2015 and 2017 exit polls, have been associated with a growing focus on them in the early part of the broadcasts.*"" 

 Evidence **\[5.9\]** collects clippings about the exit poll in relation to **financial markets**, clippings which show the markets' increased trust in the 10pm exit poll prediction. In 2017 a *CNN Money* article stated: ""The exit poll has typically been much more accurate than Britain's notoriously shoddy opinion polls"".  A 2019 pre\-election article from *Pound Sterling Live* quotes Samuel Tombs \(Chief U.K. Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics\): ""Abandon all your priors when the UK exit poll is released at 22:00 — it has a very good track record since its current methodology was introduced in 2005"".  A *Financial Times* online article published shortly before close of polls in 2019 assesses the increase in trust directly, and states: ""The exit poll's recent run of prescient results has meant that traders are putting increased stock in its predictive power, with the pound fluctuating more aggressively following the poll's release from one election to the next.""  The sequence of graphs shown below amplifies the message of that *Financial Times* article; it shows the GBP\-USD exchange rate, through election nights 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019 \(using data from *forexite.com*\).  In each panel the red line is the average price in the half\-hour *before* the 10pm close of polls, while the green line is the average for the half\-hour *after* 10pm. 





 In 2010 the 10pm fall in Sterling was only a relatively small fraction of what the currency would ultimately lose by the next morning \(even though the surprising exit poll was highly accurate\): just like the political pundits, the market did not really trust the exit poll by 2010.  As the accuracy of exit polls became more firmly established, though, the market's trust increased.  By 2017 the market's 10pm reaction to a surprising \(but ultimately accurate\) exit poll was as big as its full response to the actual result of the election the next morning. 

 John Curtice — who is by now very much the enduring public face of election polls in the UK — received a knighthood in 2018.  David Firth's underpinning technical contribution to the accuracy of modern exit polls has been recognised in public less formally, through mentions in media articles and occasional interviews for BBC TV and radio.  Ahead of the election in 2017 the BBC acknowledged David Firth's exit\-poll work through a 1\-minute feature video **\[5.10\]** which was broadcast via BBC TV news bulletins in the UK and syndicated to global media via the internet.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research conducted by Kirsty Horsey has significantly impacted on the regulation of, and law reform agenda relating to, surrogacy in England and Wales, and on the activities of NGOs lobbying for reform in this area. In particular, it was used by Surrogacy UK \(SUK\) in its campaign to secure regulatory change and legal reform. The research has generated the following impact: 

1.  It led to and informed Department of Health and Social Care \(DoH\) good practice guidelines for intended parents \(IPs\), surrogates, and professionals; 

1.  It is reflected in revised guidance on surrogacy published by Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service \(CAFCASS\); 

1.  It informed and shaped parliamentary debate and understanding of surrogacy, including the establishment, work, and findings of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on Surrogacy; 

1.  It contributed to a change in Government policy, recognising, for the first time, surrogacy as a positive form of family creation and the need for surrogacy law reform; 

1.  It shaped the consultation proposals arising out of the joint Law Commission of England and Wales and Scottish Law Commission review of surrogacy law. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 There are no official figures on the prevalence of surrogacy in the UK. However, conservative estimates suggest there are around 250 arrangements a year. These take place within a complex and thoroughly confused regulatory and legal framework, which has remained largely unchanged since the mid\-1980s. Horsey’s research has consistently argued for the need for a complete review and overhaul of the law to better reflect the intentions of the parties involved, and the lived realities of modern\-day surrogacy **\[R1\-R6\]**. Her research with SUK \(the largest non\-profit surrogacy organisation in the UK\), drawing on her earlier scholarship **\[R1**, **R3\]**, involved the largest ever surveys of surrogates, IPs and other interested parties: in 2015, \#434 responses, including 111 surrogates and 206 IPs **\[R2\]**; in 2018, \#510 responses, including 103 surrogates and 209 IPs **\[R5\]**.  Horsey’s research provides a strong evidence base for law reform. Specifically, it argues for: 

1.  Explicit Government support of surrogacy as a means of family creation **\[R2\-R4**, **R6\]**; 

1.  A systematic and transparent root and branch reform of surrogacy law **\[R2\-R5\]**; 

1.  The development of DoH guidance for all parties involved in surrogacy **\[R2\]**; 

1.  Resistance to the term ‘surrogate *mother*’ and ‘commissioning couple’ **\[R1\-2**, **R4\]**; 

1.  The reversal of the presumption of legal parenthood **\[R1\-2**, **R4\-6\]**; 

1.  The recognition of lived experience of surrogacy as a ‘relationship not a transaction’ **\[R2**, **R4\-R6\]**; 

1.  IPs to be supported to enter surrogacy arrangements in the UK, rather than overseas **\[R2**, **R4\-R6\]**; 

1.  The removal of the six\-month time limit to apply for parental orders **\[R2**, **R5\]**; 

1.  ‘Double donation’, allowing IPs where neither can provide gametes to become legal parents **\[R2**, **R5\]**; 

1.  Improved data collection and a review of the prohibition of advertising **\[R2**, **R5\].** 

 A distinctive aspect of Horsey’s research is that the legal analysis is informed by the lived experience of surrogacy \(through the survey data\). As SUK notes: **R2** and **R5** ‘elevated the importance of the lived experience of surrogacy in the debate over reform’, and ‘gave voice’ to surrogates and IPs **\[a\]**.

","
 **4. Impact** 

 In 2015, following a number of hyperbolic judicial and parliamentary interventions, SUK started its ‘Campaign for Change’ to advocate for legal and regulatory reform and to address ongoing ‘myths’ about surrogacy practices. It was led by a five\-member Working Group on Surrogacy Law Reform \(SUKWG\). Horsey was the only academic member of this group. Her research **\[R1**, **R3\-R4**, **R6\]** played a key role in shaping the campaign, including conceiving, researching, and writing the group’s 2015 and 2018 reports **\[R2**, **R5\]**. SUK states that Horsey’s research was: ‘instrumental in opening up the possibility of new surrogacy legislation in the UK \[…\]. We fundamentally believe that without \[ **R2** and **R5**\] the process of law reform, that is now well underway, would have been significantly slower, narrower in scope, and may not have happened at all.’ **\[a\]** 

 The ongoing campaign has had several impacts. All but three of the 20 recommendations made in the 2015 and 2018 reports **\[R2 and R5\]** have been adopted, partially adopted, or are proposed in the current Law Commissions’ consultation on surrogacy law reform **\[b\]**, and all of the 10 recommendations made by the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Surrogacy mirror those in Horsey’s research **\[R1\-R2**, **R4\-R6**; **h\]**. The reach of these impacts is demonstrated by their extension to the UK Government, UK Parliament, Government agencies, NGOs, and the Law Commissions, as well as to surrogates, IPs, and medical, legal, and social work professionals. The significance of the campaign lies in the substantial change it has brought to the oversight and regulation of surrogacy in the UK, a change in Government policy relating to surrogacy as a form of family creation, the maintaining of momentum for legal change, and  the shaping of many of the current proposals for reform that will potentially benefit hundreds of families a year. 

 **1. Led to, and informed, two sets of Department of Health and Social Care \(DoH\) good practice guidance for surrogates and IPs, and professionals working in the area** 

 SUK states that Horsey’s research ‘paved the way’ for Government guidance on surrogacy **\[a\]**. Horsey’s research demonstrated how many of those involved in surrogacy \(including surrogates, IPs and professionals working with them: lawyers, midwives, and hospitals, CAFCASS and fertility clinics\) often navigate a complex legal process without consistent and authoritative guidance **\[R2\]**. 

 A key recommendation of **R2** was that there should be official guidance on surrogacy to address these problems, including a Governmental commitment, to support surrogacy as a form of family building. Horsey attended meetings at the DoH with Nicola Blackwood MP **\[n\]**, Phillip Dunne MP and Jackie Doyle\-Price MP, where the need for, and the substance of, this guidance \(as well as surrogacy law reform more broadly\), was discussed. She later joined a small working group that worked with a senior civil servant to draft the proposed guidance. ‘The Surrogacy Pathway’ \(for IPs and surrogates\) and ‘Care in Surrogacy’ \(for professionals\) were published by the DoH in February 2018 **\[c\]**. The guidance includes an explicit statement that ‘the Government supports surrogacy as part of the range of assisted conception options’, and reference to the importance of terminology \(as recommended in **R2**\). These documents form the first national guidance of its kind in the UK and worldwide. They are also the first time the UK Government explicitly endorsed and supported surrogacy as a means of family creation. 

 **2. Changes to Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service \(CAFCASS\) guidance relating to surrogacy** 

 CAFCASS represents children in family court cases in England. It is directly involved in the parental order process whereby legal parenthood can be transferred from the surrogate \(and her spouse or civil partner, if she has one\) to the IPs. CAFCASS figures suggest that it deals with around 200 parental order applications a year, relating to around 250 children. In 2016, Horsey met with CAFCASS to discuss their online information on surrogacy and training materials for employees dealing with surrogacy cases. This led to conceptual shifts in CAFCASS literature, which Horsey drafted. The CAFCASS Parental Order Reporters Fact Sheet \(2016\) now refers to ‘surrogates’ and ‘intended parents’ \(rather than surrogate *mothers* and *commissioning* parents\). This change in terminology \(recommended in **R2**\) reflects a significant shift in institutional understanding towards those using surrogacy \(surrogates do not view themselves as the mothers of the children they carry for other couples or individuals, and feel the language of ‘motherhood’ and ‘commissioning’ is undermining\), and of surrogacy itself as a means of family formation **\[d\]**. 

 **3. Informing and shaping parliamentary debate and the establishment, work and findings of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on Surrogacy** 

 Since the late 1990s, comprehensive surrogacy law reform had largely fallen off the political agenda. A key part of SUK’s campaign was to initiate and contribute to informed parliamentary debate. Horsey’s work included attending meetings and briefings with members of the House of Lords and Commons – including Barker, Deech, Craigavon, Patel, Mackay, Watkins, Bach, King \(HL\) and Percy, Andrew, Duffield, McMorrin, West, Johnston, Cable \(HC\) – producing briefings \(drawing on **R1\-R6**\), drafting parliamentary questions and organising conferences in central London \(in 2016 and 2019\) to discuss the findings of the SUK 2015 and 2018 Reports **\[R2** and **R5\]**. These were attended by Baroness Barker and Lord Craigavon, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority \(HFEA\), the Law Commission and senior DoH civil servants. On the morning of the 2016 conference, Baroness Warnock \(the architect of the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985\), appeared with the Chair of SUKWG on the BBC’s Woman’s Hour, arguing that the law needed to change. 

 In December 2016, the House of Lords debated surrogacy law reform for the first time in over 20 years. A briefing written by Horsey, drawing on her research, was circulated to Barker, Craigavon, and others. Barker quoted Horsey in **R3**, stating that surrogacy had become ‘the fertility treatment that time forgot’, and said that they were ‘very fortunate’ to have the SUK 2015 report **\[e\]**. Lord Berkeley adopted **R2**’s description of surrogacy as a ‘relationship not a transaction’ **\[e\]**. Viscount Craigavon referred to **R2** and the 2016 conference as a ‘milestone \[…\] assist\[ing\] serious reform taking place on the basis of more accurate information and data’ **\[e\]**. In total, seven of the nine peers who spoke referred to, or relied on, arguments made in **R2** **\[e\]**. Barker referred directly to **R2** again in a debate in the House of Lords in December 2018, where she stated that her interest had been ‘principally’ fuelled by ‘by the work done by Surrogacy UK in 2016 \(sic\) when it produced a report’, quoted directly from a briefing written by Horsey in a debate on the 40th anniversary of IVF \(drawing on **R2** and **R1**\), and referred again to **R2** in a written question in 2020 **\[f**, **q\]**. 

 Surrogacy law reform was raised in Parliament on at least 15 separate occasions between February 2017 and January 2020. In December 2017, Andrew Percy MP established an APPG on Surrogacy to ‘fully review our surrogacy laws, encourage and promote debate on the issues, facilitate further research into how surrogacy is conducted, bring the law into line with modern social realities, and encourage domestic surrogacy in the first instance’. He asked the SUKWG \(of which Horsey is part\) to be its Secretariat. 21 MPs and three peers have since served on the APPG. Five evidence sessions were held between October 2018 and January 2019 with 45 IPs, surrogates, lawyers, legal and psychology academics, and others \(including all of the non\-profit surrogacy organisations, CAFCASS, the Law Commission, Stonewall, Julie Bindel, and Tom Daley\). Altogether, 16 of the recommendations made in **R2** and **R5** are reflected in the 10 recommendations included in the APPG’s Report published in October 2020 **\[h\]**. 

 **4. Contributing to a change in Government policy to recognise, for the first time, surrogacy as a positive form of family creation and the need for surrogacy law reform** 

 As Percy MP noted in the House of Commons in December 2018: ‘Going back decades \[…\] there has always been something of a nervousness in Government about the language used around surrogacy’ **\[l\]**. SUK states that Horsey’s research ‘paved the way’ for ‘a change in policy from the Government, which now formally supports surrogacy as a legitimate form of family building and recognises the need for the law to be reviewed’ **\[a\]**. In March 2016, Jane Ellison MP, then Parliamentary Under\-Secretary of State for Health, stated that the Department had no plans to review surrogacy law **\[p1**, **p2\]**. The momentum created by SUK’s campaign, including the publication of the good practice guidance, and repeated parliamentary questions **\[p1\-p4\]**, and direct representations to the DoH, including \(as of March 2016\) 22 that made direct or indirect reference to **R2** **\[p1\]**, contributed to a fundamental shift in Government policy. In December 2016, a group of surrogates wrote to Jeremy Hunt MP and Nicola Blackwood MP, explicitly relying on **R2** to make the case for legal reform: ‘We are surrogates who have given birth to 75 surrogate babies between us with 14 babies on the way, and members of Surrogacy UK. We are writing to you about the need for urgent reform of surrogacy law. We support everything that was said in the report “Surrogacy in the UK: Myth\-busting and reform”’ **\[m\]**. 

 In February 2016, Percy MP wrote to the then Prime Minster, asking him to ‘support wholeheartedly, reform of the law on surrogacy in line with proposals made by the organisation Surrogacy UK in \[ **R2**\]’ **\[o\]**. In May 2016, Ellison MP, stated for the first time that the ‘Government recognises the arguments for the need for a review \[of surrogacy law\]’, and had asked the Law Commission to consult on its inclusion in its 13th programme of law reform **\[p4\]**. On 19 July 2018, Jackie Doyle\-Price MP \(with whom Horsey had met on 11 July 2018\), then the Minister responsible in the DoH \(and now a member of the APPG\), was the first British Minister to publicly state in the House of Commons the positive role that surrogacy plays in the UK **\[g\]**. This was reiterated by Lord O’Shaughnessy in the House of Lords in December 2018 **\[f\]** and Andrea Leadsom, then Leader of the House of Commons, in May 2019 **\[j\]**. In January 2020, during a House of Commons debate on the Government’s policy on surrogacy, Percy MP stated: ‘The debate in the 1980s was very different from the debate we have now. We now understand that surrogacy in this country works, and that it is a legitimate and loving way in which families are created’. He identified the DoH good practice guidance \(referred to above\) as a key component of this. He stated: ‘I also want to say a big “thank you” to the Surrogacy UK working group on surrogacy law reform, which has done a brilliant job \[… \]. A big “thank you” is also due to \[…\] Dr Kirsty Horsey from Kent University, who led and chaired \[sic\] the review working party within Surrogacy UK’ **\[i\]**. In February 2020, Progress Educational Trust \(a charity committed to informing debate on assisted conception and genetics\) commented in its newsletter: ‘What is most remarkable in relation to surrogacy is how the support for it among MPs has grown over the years and the level of acceptance. \[…\] This is thanks in large part to the work of Surrogacy UK \[…\]. And we can't talk about surrogacy law reform without mentioning \[…\] Dr Kirsty Horsey's work – particularly her reports – which has been highly influential’ **\[k\]**. 

 **5. Informing and shaping the Law Commission’s consultation proposals on surrogacy law reform** 

 In July 2016, the England and Wales Law Commission \(with Government support\) consulted the inclusion of surrogacy in its 13th Programme of Law Reform. The SUKWG initiated a SUK letter writing campaign encouraging its members to respond to the consultation. 343 people and groups responded supporting its inclusion, the largest number of responses to the proposed potential projects. In June 2019, at a conference organised by Horsey, a joint England and Wales and Scottish Law Commission consultation was launched, recommending root and branch reform of the law \(as recommended in **R2**, **R5**\), funded by the Government. 

 Horsey and the SUKWG were one of a number of stakeholders with whom the Law Commission met before the publication of the Law Commission’s ‘Building families through surrogacy: a new law’ report was published. SUKWG’s 2015 report **\[R2\]** is discussed as part of the ‘current context’ of the review. Horsey’s research is cited 28 times throughout the report. Just over a quarter of the consultation’s provisional proposals \(\#13\), and invitations for consultees’ views \(\#17\) mirror those made in **R1**, **R2**, and/or **R5**, including to reverse the presumption of legal parenthood, allowing for ‘double donation’, and greater regulation of ‘approved’ surrogacy organisations **\[b\]**. The Law Commission is due to report on the consultation in 2022.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Accurate estimates of expected rates of returns and investment time horizons are crucial for investment managers when it comes to assessing the risk and return characteristics of equity portfolios. In 2019, the value of global assets under management was estimated at US$89 trillion, approximately one\-quarter of all the world’s wealth. The quality of decisions made by investment managers therefore has significant implications for the world economy. Schröder’s research has directly influenced the commercial practice of investment and portfolio managers, enabling them to better understand the success factors behind the so\-called value investment style and thus to discover better investment opportunities. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In an early article \(published 2007\), Schröder analysed alternative ways to estimate expected stock market returns. This information is essential for fund managers making strategic, long\-term asset allocation decisions. At the same time, expected market returns are a crucial parameter in many of the asset pricing models used to determine the expected returns of individual stocks and asset prices. Schröder proposed that analyst earnings forecasts could be used for this purpose. This entirely forward\-focused approach would circumvent the problems of previous models, which relied on information about past returns in order to predict future returns. 

 Since joining Birkbeck in 2009, Schröder has built on this research in collaboration with a co\-author who is also an asset management professional. A series of three articles published in 2014, 2016, and 2018 have seen Schröder develop his original model by focusing on individual stocks rather than the market as a whole; by offering a method for estimating the equity risk, as well as the expected returns, of individual shares; and by exploring the effect of market inefficiencies on estimates of expected returns. 

 <ins>Using expected returns to improve equity portfolios</ins> 

 After the publication of his 2007 article, Schröder was approached by Florian Esterer, then a senior portfolio manager at Swisscanto Asset Management. As a practitioner, Esterer recognised the value of Schröder’s previous work. He suggested that the same approach could be used to predict individual stock returns, and the pair undertook a joint study \[1\] which tested the ability of expected return estimates developed on Schröder’s model to predict individual stock returns. These results were successfully applied to create portfolios which outperformed the market, even after risk adjustments and transaction costs were taken into account. 

 <ins>Estimating the time horizon and interest sensitivity of equities</ins> 

 Based on this work, Schröder and Esterer went on to estimate not only the expected returns, but also the equity risk of individual shares. A developing research literature suggests that the timing of a firm’s cash flows \(such as dividends\) is crucial to understanding the equity risk presented by their shares. Schröder’s and Esterer’s follow\-up study \[2\] deployed Schröder’s method \(using the forecasts created by equity analysts\) to estimate the expected timing of cashflows in particular firms. This was the first study to create an entirely forward\-looking estimate of equity duration, in analogy to the well\-established concept of bond duration. It also shares the same interpretation of measure of a share price’s sensitivity to changes in the discount rate. 

 The concept of duration put forward in this study is useful for investment managers of pension funds who are seeking to assess their portfolio’s sensitivity to changes in discount rates. It can help trustees ensure a better match between their investments across asset classes and pension liabilities without sacrificing too much in the way of potential returns. 

 <ins>Estimating the timing and pricing of dividends</ins> 

 In a further study \[4\], Schröder refines the approach developed in previous papers to show that market equity risk premia are \(i\) depending on the investment time horizon and \(ii\) dynamically change in response to economic business cycle. This finding gives asset managers the possibility to shift their asset portfolio from long\-term to short\-term investments and vice versa, optimizing their exposure to a large equity risk premia. 

 <ins>Impact of market efficiency on expected returns estimates</ins> 

 Forward\-looking estimates of expected stock returns assume that equity markets are efficient; i.e., that prices reflect all available information at all times. This might not, however, always be the case. In another extension to his research \[3\], Schröder examined the effect of market inefficiencies on expected return estimates. The study found that expected returns estimates were indeed more accurate in efficient equity markets relative to less efficient equity markets. 

 <ins>Estimating the timing and pricing of dividends</ins> 

 In a further study \[4\], Schröder refines the approach developed in previous papers to show that market equity risk premia are \(i\) depending on the investment time horizon and \(ii\) dynamically change in response to economic business cycle. This finding gives asset managers the possibility to shift their asset portfolio from long\-term to short\-term investments and vice versa, optimizing their exposure to large equity risk premia.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 In 2019, the investment management industry was responsible for looking after approximately US$90 trillion \( [Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com/en-gb/publications/2020/global-asset-management-protect-adapt-innovate)\), almost one\-quarter of the world’s wealth \(estimated at US$399 trillion by  [Credit Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html)\). Decisions made by investment managers therefore have significant implications for the global economy. Schröder’s work, which was taken up by the industry on its publication in 2016, appeared in research briefings across the sector and has changed the practice of major asset management firms, helping them to better manage their clients’ investments and therefore contributing to global economic growth. 

 When Schröder and Esterer’s paper on equity duration was published in 2016 it rapidly circulated across the financial services sector. In a Global Quantitative Report of August 2016 \[a\], strategists at Morgan Stanley \(which  [consistently dominates market share in equities trading worldwide](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/3001930/equities-fixed-income-trading-market-share)\) cited Schröder and Esterer’s work as a way to better understand the return differential between value and growth stocks, acknowledging that ‘measuring duration for equities is a lot more challenging than for fixed income instruments’ and describing Schröder and Esterer’s work as a ‘sophisticated’ approach. These reports do not only circulate amongst finance professionals but are also used to communicate investment advice to the banks’ clients, informing their individual investment decisions and extending the reach of this research. Esterer and Schröder were also invited to present their findings to investment managers at \[redacted\]; who had a natural interest in their work given that, in September 2018, \[redacted\] had £30.1 billion in equity assets under management \[c\]. 

 A case study of the scale and nature of Schröder and Esterer’s influence can be found at \[redacted\], another bank where the researchers met with industry practitioners to explain and discuss their work and its implications for portfolio management. In January 2017, a report from \[redacted’s\] research division focused extensively on Schröder and Esterer’s findings \[b\]. The report opens with a discussion of their research in the context of portfolio choice for investors but then goes on to build an entire equity duration analysis based on \(and ‘motivated by’\) Schröder’s proposed duration measures. This analysis has directly informed the company’s investment decisions. \[The company’s head of European qualitative research\] stated in March 2018 \(over a year after the publication of this initial report\) that Schröder and Esterer’s work had been crucial in framing its approach to measuring the duration of global stocks. In particular, they had used Schröder’s modelling device as a building block of their approach to estimating interest rate sensitivity of equity portfolios \[d\]. The scale of the investments involved is significant \[: approximately AU$141.4 billion in equities worldwide and AU$56 billion in European, Middle Eastern, and Asian infrastructure and real estate equities\] \[e\]. These figures do not take into account the additional private investors who consult \[redacted\] as a source of information when planning their own investments. 

 Esterer’s position as Head of Asset Management Equities at Bank J Safra Sarasin has also enabled him to put the findings of the research begun by Schröder and continued in joint collaboration into practice in his work environment. He confirms that the ‘papers on the implied cost of capital and implied duration \[have\] significantly improved \[the bank’s\] understanding of value investing. Identifying… success factors has enabled us to improve our ability to find attractive investment opportunities as well as enhanced our ability to identify stages in market cycles, thereby improving the return of our investment portfolios’ \[f\]. At the end of 2019, Sarasin managed a total portfolio of CHF185.8bn; estimating equity holdings at a conservative 25%, this represents CHF46 billion \(or £35.6 billion\) in equities whose investment was influenced by Schröder and Esterer’s work \[g\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Stephen Baysted's creative research practice in composition, audio direction and sound design contributed significantly to the development and successful release of 3 critically\-acclaimed and globally\-distributed commercial racing simulation games \( *Project Cars*, *Project Cars 2* and *Project Cars 3*\). This work culminated in the games’ worldwide commercial success; the enhancement of over 5,000,000 gamers’ experiences; the widespread dissemination of the creative and technical processes of composition, audio design and development to diverse public audiences; and the stimulation of public debate and discourse. These impacts are evident in sales figures, professional and amateur reviews, worldwide media coverage, the exploitation of *Project Cars* music in non\-gaming contexts, and player engagement in various fora. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Much of Baysted's creative research practice operates within a commercial and technologically complex and constraining context. The commercial brief acts as a series of creative parameters that stimulate and necessitate innovation and new insights into the particular genre or form being explored, and the technology serves to create technical challenges that require novel solutions. The creative processes of game music and audio design therefore sit in tension between the financial realities of the marketplace, the practicalities and limitations of technology, and the creative ambitions of the producers \( **R4**\). These innovations and insights have been widely explored within the sub\-discipline of Ludomusicology \(including in **R4**, **R5** and **R6**\). 

 The underpinning research for the impacts described herein relates to the video game trilogy *Project Cars* \(2015\), *Project Cars 2* \(2017\) and *Project Cars 3* \(2020\): multi\-platform racing simulations \(and their associated marketing trailers\) published and distributed globally by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Baysted was Composer and Audio Director for all 3 games. In terms of composition, Baysted’s research explores questions of immersion, diegesis, ‘game music literacy’ and genre \( **R6**\). In terms of audio design, the outputs utilise and build upon Baysted's novel approaches to realistic vehicle sound modelling, which he developed in previous projects \( *Need for Speed Shift* \(2009\) and *Shift 2: Unleashed* \(2011\)\), and which here confront the challenges of new technologies \(virtual reality and augmented reality\) and emerging ‘surround sound’ formats in the domain of videogame development \(Dolby Atmos™, Binaural and Ambisonic audio\). 

 In a genre \(racing simulation\) where music is, conventionally, never heard within gameplay itself, and only within the introductory sections and menu systems \(because it interferes with the principal auditory mechanisms necessary for actually playing the game\), the composer must seek innovative ways of engaging and immersing the player within the simulated game world, preparing the player for the action that is about to take place \(discussed in **R4**\). In *Project Cars* \(2015\) \( **R1**\), Baysted embedded additional layers of processed audio with a broad range of real\-world non\-musical sounds recorded from motor racing \(including ‘pit to car’ radio transmissions, car engine sounds and trackside ambiences\) within the musical fabric itself in order to enhance the player’s sense of immersion within the simulated world. 

 In *Project Cars 2* \(2017\) \( **R2**\), Baysted further experimented with these techniques. These innovations included the layering of recorded interviews of racing drivers describing their experiences of racing into the musical fabric as a way of heightening the player's emotional responses, deepening immersion and dramatising the experience of navigating the menu system \(discussed in **R4**\). This approach had never been used before in the genre. Baysted’s score also transcends the music\-stylistic norms and conventions of racing games by fusing contemporary cinematic orchestral language with operatic vocal writing and elements of electronica and rock. 

 Due to the COVID\-19 pandemic, the development of *Project Cars 3* \(2020\) \( **R3**\) was delayed by approximately 4 months. This meant that the score had to be composed, recorded and mixed entirely during the first lockdown. Furthermore, the cancellation of the planned full orchestral recording sessions posed additional difficulties which were overcome by recording individual orchestral musicians remotely from their own homes. 

 In **R3**, Baysted collaborated with Guy Fletcher \(Dire Straits\) and 6 Drum and Bass artists from the UK\-based record label RAM Records Ltd, to create a musical score that adapts dynamically as the player navigates the menu system. This sees the music become increasingly dramatic as the player approaches the race, heightening tension, immersion and player expectation. The starting point for the majority of the music was original Drum and Bass tracks which Baysted and Fletcher then renegotiated and reframed, and out of which 2 contrasting ‘ambient’ versions and a dramatic orchestral version were created. Each of the three versions is of an identical length, tempo, key and structure to the original, which enables the music to be crossfaded seamlessly between each version of the track as the player moves through the User Interface. Baysted’s original orchestral music tracks were then remixed by the Drum and Bass artists. The concept, musical mechanism and cross\-genre bi\-directional musical collaboration is unique. 

 Some 30 marketing trailers have been produced to advertise the *Project Cars* trilogy, all of which have included audio design and music by Baysted, or music arranged by Baysted. Many of the trailers have also challenged the norms of the genre, including an arrangement of Beethoven’s 7<sup>th</sup> Symphony final movement, and a setting of Robert Burns’ poem ‘Ca’ the Yowes’, for which there was a separate EP release due to public request.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impacts of Baysted's innovative research into sound design and soundtrack composition in racing simulation are fourfold: 

-  Worldwide commercial success of *Project Cars*, *Project Cars 2*, and *Project Cars 3* 

-  Enhancing the immersion and experience of at least 5,000,000 gamers 

-  Catalysing debate, discourse and commentary in and around the games industry 

-  Dissemination to the wider public of the creative and technical processes involved in composition, audio design and development 

 These impacts, all of which are materially and distinctly linked to Baysted's specific and innovative research\-based contribution to the *Project Cars* trilogy, are described in detail below. 

 **Commercial success** 

 To date, **R1**, **R2** and **R3** have achieved combined sales in excess of 5,000,000 units worldwide \( **C1**\). Baysted’s audio direction, sound design and music scores were crucial factors in generating this commercial success – a fact that is corroborated by a wealth of professional reviews \(print and online\), including from IGN \(the largest games news site in the world, and  [526<sup>th</sup> most\-visited](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ign.com) website worldwide\). The IGN reports that ‘the sound is seriously stunning \[…\] as nice as this game looks, though, it honestly sounds even better \[…\] And those exhaust notes? Just listen to that F\-Type Jag above – *and this is one of the road cars*’ \( **C2**\). The scores, audio design and games have earned many prestigious international peer award nominations, including a Jerry Goldsmith Award nomination for ‘Best Score in a Video Game’ \(2015\) \( **C3**\), and a nomination for the Golden Joystick Award for ‘Best Audio in a Game’ \( **C4**\). Music and sound design from all 3 games was also used outside the game context, including in 30 online commercial trailers \(some of which appeared on TV and in cinema\), BBC’s *Top Gear* \( **R1** in 2017\) and successful commercial soundtrack releases \(on iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, YouTube\). 

 **Enhanced gamer experience and immersion** 

 As mentioned above, over 5,000,000 people worldwide have purchased the *Project Cars* games, nearly all of whom have all benefitted from the distinctive and immersive soundtracks developed for them. This figure does not include multi\-players per unit or secondhand buyers. 

 The substantial contribution to these gamer's experience and immersion is demonstrated by the millions of views of YouTube videos featuring the games’ \( **R1**, **R2** and **R3**\) sound design and soundtracks. Comments posted in reaction to these soundtracks further underpin their importance to the quality and intensity of the overall gaming experience \(quotes, colloquialisms and typos here cited verbatim\): 

 *‘Best soundtrack of any racing game ever*.’ 

 ‘*When the commentator speaks, that's when you know its deeper than just racing*.’ 

 ‘ \[…\] *that british guy describing Eau Rouge like a poem at the beginning of the video. raises the hair on my neck everytime*’. 

 ‘*This s\*\*\* is cool scary and somehow inspirational at the same time not really the music you would think to be in a racing game but I truly love it best sound track I've ever listened to*.’ 

 ‘*“Goosebump”... These soundtracks better than a emotional game's soundtracks. Perfect\!*’ 

 ‘*This is one of my all\-time favorite trailer for a car pack DLC \(from any racing game\) and the song used for it \(together with the highland theme map\) certainly delivered in atmosphere\!* *That song got so much positive feedback they actually re\-recorded it to make it available for purchase. I bought it on iTunes as soon as I found out it was available.*’ 

 **Catalysing debate, discourse and commentary in and around the games industry** 

 The games have catalysed significant debate across mainstream media outlets \( **C5**\), gameplay\-related fora, blogs, and music sales and share sites. The innovations in the games were also critical in **R1**’s nomination for the Jerry Goldsmith Award \(2015\), **R2**’s nomination for the Golden Joystick Award \(2017\), **R2**’s nomination for Best Racing Game in the 2017 Wired UK, **R2**/ **R3**’s wins in Gamescom \(2017 and 2020\) awards, and **R3**’s TIGA \(2020\) Award – all of which themselves amplified the reach and significance of these debates. 

 Reviews by professional critics and amateur bloggers and vloggers also generate debate in their own right. A Google search of ‘Project Cars Game’ and ‘review’ yields over 36,100 results; ‘Project Cars 2’ and ‘review’ yields over 433,000. There are over 500,000 streams of the scores on Spotify, and \(as mentioned above\) millions more YouTube, featuring the scores, game trailers, and gameplay featuring music and audio design. Many reviews explore the importance of the games’ audio and musical features \(see IGN link above\) and their efficacy in enhancing player immersion. Whilst not always so eloquent as the professional reviewers, amateur gamers often pick up on \(and argue about\) detailed aspects of the sound design and music. 

 **Dissemination of the creative and technical processes of composition, audio design and development** 

 Baysted has appeared \(by invitation\) on 2 BBC Radio 3 *Sound of Cinema* programmes in 2018 and 2019 \(the first with a live audience at the V&A Museum, the second recorded at his studio\), in which his role was to help audiences understand and navigate the processes and techniques involved in composing music for video games, and how they differ from those of film \( **C6**\). Baysted has also been a panellist at many games industry and wider music industry conferences \(Develop Conference, BASCA, Screen Composers Network\). Furthermore, a wealth of interviews, articles and videos \(in the UK and internationally\) about his work have been published, discussing the creative and technical processes of game music creation, including an article in which he discusses the composition and recording process underpinning **R2** \( **C7**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Attic inscriptions have previously only been accessible to specialists with good knowledge of Ancient Greek and Latin. Lambert, who played a leading role in revising the authoritative corpus of Attic inscriptions, made English translations freely available and searchable.  In setting up and running the research\-based Attic Inscriptions Online \(AIO\), he made rich insights into the history of this well\-documented city, and the lives of its inhabitants, available to a diverse range of users around the world. AIO enhanced interpretations of the materials and made them more accessible for other heritage professionals and museum visitors. AIO also transformed how teachers engage Classics students and its technical infrastructure inspired the creation of other unique archives. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Inscriptions are the single most important documentary source for the history of ancient Athens and its surrounding region, Attica, ca. 700 BC – AD 300. Some 20,000 Attic inscriptions are extant, encompassing a range of different document types from lengthy legal texts and accounts, to simple funerary monuments inscribed with the name of the dead. This is about a fifth of the total number of all Ancient Greek inscriptions, a total steadily increasing every year with new finds. The inscriptions yield rich insights unavailable from other types of written and material evidence into the political, economic and cultural history of ancient Athens. For example, out of almost 63,000 ancient Athenians who are known by name, around 90% of them have had their names revealed through inscriptions. 

 Lambert has been integral in revising the authoritative corpus of Attic inscriptions, published by the Berlin Academy \(Inscriptiones Graecae\) **\[3.1\]**. He is responsible for three scholarly volumes relating to the inscribed laws and decrees of Athens in the period of Demosthenes \(4<sup>th</sup> century BC\): a corpus of the Greek texts of 281 inscriptions, mostly extensive texts, with annotation in Latin **\[3.1\]**, and collections of research essays **\[3.2, 3.3\]**. This work laid the foundations for Attic Inscriptions Online \(AIO\), an online database created and run by Lambert to provide open access to these ancient resources. 

 In December 2012, Lambert launched AIO with English translations of the 281 inscriptions featured in corpus **\[3.1\]**. He continues to curate the site which, funded through subsequent grants from Cardiff University, Utrecht University and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, has steadily developed from a starting point of simple translations. Its 1,837 entries \(July 2020\) form almost 10% of all Attic inscriptions and cover a high proportion of longer and more historically important texts. AIO’s unique framework runs on a custom content management system developed for the site in Python using the Django framework. Its bespoke design has numerous unique features, enabling the site to evolve dynamically, which is unusual as databases tend to be much more structurally static. A range of features have been added to maximise the usefulness of the site, from explanatory notes and key metadata through to an array of linkages, both internal and external. For example, links to related inscriptions, images, Greek texts and mapping data, a selection of videos, a range of browse and search options, and increasingly AIO’s own Greek texts and images. 

 The site’s expansion has been informed by Lambert’s ongoing research, including that published in the series of AIO Papers **\[3.4\]**. Lambert is sole author on six of these, and lead or co\-author on two others. They: 

-  explain cases where the Greek text translated on AIO differs from published texts; 

-  provide analyses of individual inscriptions and groups of texts \- for example AIO Papers, 4 discusses the inscribed Athenian decrees of 229/8\-198/7 BC and AIO Papers, 7 presents fresh Greek texts and discussion of the date of the latest inscribed accounts of the building of the Erechtheion. 

 In addition to his own research, Lambert also leads an international team \(from the UK, Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany, Greece, Switzerland, the US, and Australia\) encompassing 32 site contributors who work on translating and annotating inscriptions, with some also providing IT support and serving on the site’s Advisory Board. 

 **2.1 Attic Inscriptions in UK project \(AIUK\)** 

 Since 2017 Lambert has been the PI on an AHRC\-funded project **\[G3.1\]** to edit and publish on AIO, for the first time, all Attic inscriptions \(ca. 250\) held in UK collections. The inscriptions are published as AIUK Papers; seven of the fifteen to date have been authored solely by Lambert. The fifteen papers cover inscriptions at Petworth House; the British School at Athens and the Fitzwilliam Museum; Cambridge, Lyme Park, Leeds City Museum; Chatsworth, Broomhall, the Great North Museum; and the first two parts of the British Museum’s collection **\[3.5\]**. 

 This is the first time that many of these inscriptions have been published in modern and accessible editions. For example, the last edition of the Attic inscriptions in the British Museum dates to 1874. The AIUK project has **\[3.5\]**: 

-  unearthed previously unpublished inscriptions; 

-  identified joins between fragments in UK Collections and fragments still in Athens; 

-  enabled the first coherent collection\-history of this material in the UK to emerge. 

 The translations of the Attic inscriptions in UK collections are being published on the AIO main site with more accessible annotation aimed at students and visitors to museums. AIO has also been used in the development of other digital published editions: for example, the Collection of Greek Ritual Norms \(CGRN\), the authoritative international online resource for inscriptions for the study of Greek religion, frequently refers to and makes use of AIO. AIO’s English translations of Athenian laws and decrees of 352/1\-322/1 BC and 300/299\-168/7 BC have also been used in the digital editions published on the Berlin Academy’s IG website \(the website for Inscriptiones Graecae \- IG II<sup>3</sup> 1 fascicules 2, 4 and 5\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Lambert’s research revolutionised the accessibility of Attic inscriptions; changed how heritage professionals and museum visitors present and understand inscriptions; enhanced the teaching of the history of ancient Athens; and underpinned the technical development of other archives. 

 **4.1 Providing searchable access to ‘lost’ Attic inscriptions for multiple uses** 

 Before the launch of Attic Inscriptions Online \(AIO\), very few inscriptions had been translated into English, either in print or online, and finding multiple inscriptions with linked subject matter or content was exceptionally difficult for those without knowledge of Ancient Greek. AIO’s open access and user\-friendly database changed this. 

 AIO has published more English translations of Attic inscriptions – 1,837 to date – than any other single publication, hard copy or online, and is unique among online inscriptions databases in foregrounding translations, making this kind of source material freely available to non\-specialists and those without knowledge of Latin and Greek. Since August 2013, the site has had nearly 230,000 visits, with a monthly average of 5,008 visits from 5,846 locations worldwide \(since January 2018\) **\[5.1\]**. Since August 2013, after the UK, the site has been visited most frequently by users from the USA, Greece, Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Australia, France and Japan, followed by 164 other countries **\[5.1\]**. The 2019/20 user survey \(114 respondents\) supports this, showing that 60% of respondents were based outside the UK **\[5.2\]**. 

 The survey also provides a snapshot of the wide range of user groups. Respondents include educators from primary, secondary and University education institutions, students, collection managers, museum curators, and members of the public with an interest in Greek epigraphy **\[5.2\]**. One visitor commented: *“AIO is a pioneering project which has the power to transform the landscape of the study not only of Ancient Athenian inscriptions but also of the humanities as a whole. It is a major tool for the dissemination of classics and the subsequent appreciation by larger segments of the population of their importance”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 AIO resulted in changes in awareness and knowledge of the inscriptions for users: 

-  *""…Greek inscriptions have not always been used to the fullest potential. AIO Online makes Attic inscriptions accessible for the widest possible audience and gives helpful links and notes"";* 

-  *“By far the most efficient and informative source for Attic inscriptions"";* 

-  *“The notes and comments to the texts are highly valuable and up\-to\-date”;* 

-  *“\[AIO\] significantly improves our ability to find, understand and further investigate these inscriptions”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 **4.2 Helping heritage professionals and visitors to better understand inscriptions** 

 The website is used by museums and curators including the British Museum and the Krateros project in the USA, to better use and present their collections and to improve their accessibility **\[5.2\]**. In the 2019/20 survey, 7 out of 8 self\-identified collections managers or museum curators said the site had had a significant or transformative impact on their capacity to present Attic inscriptions to visitors **\[5.2\]**. Curators from museums, including the British Museum, noted: 

-  *“Inscriptions have been historically difficult to display and visitors often walk past…This project has the great benefit of making inscriptions more accessible both visually and in terms of their content* **\[5.2\]**; 

-  *“The inscriptions here are well organized and the notes are extremely helpful for me as an \[museum\] educator who is not an expert in the area”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 AIO is also widening access to Greek inscriptions for both virtual and physical museum visitors. In the 2019/20 survey, 16% of respondents self\-identified as a museum visitor. Of these, nearly three quarters reported that being able to access AIO had had a significant or transformative impact on their understanding of Attic inscriptions in a collection they had visited or planned to visit. Respondents stated: 

-  *“It is very useful to have up\-to\-date details on current locations of inscriptions so that you can know in advance what you are actually going to see in a particular museum”*; 

-  *“The historical background and translations provided by AIO finally allow \[users\] to see inscriptions not as texts on stone but provide the necessary historical context for the texts to be understood”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 **4.3 Transforming educational practices for teaching the history of Ancient Athens** 

 AIO is used globally and has unlocked Ancient Greek inscriptions in both Higher and Secondary education settings. One teacher stated: *“It is transformative...for pedagogy, where one is working with students for whom untranslated Greek is either challenging or impossible to work with""* **\[5.2\]**. 

 According to the 2019/20 user survey, just over half of AIO’s visitors were engaged in teaching or learning **\[5.2\]**. To put this in context, around 10% of the 6,500 UK students a year studying Classical subjects at A\-level take Ancient History. Additionally, there are approximately 30 University Departments in the UK offering degrees in Classics and/or Ancient History, and a further 8 where Classical options are taught within other degrees. In the 2019/20 survey, 86% of 51 self\-identified teaching users rated AIO and its resources to be transformative or significant. 89% of 38 self\-identified student users also described it as having a transformative or significant impact on their learning **\[5.2\]**. 

 For example, a student noted: *“it helped a lot for my studies, \[e\]specially in lessons \[like\] Greek Epigraphy, and it made the start of every investigation much more easy and comfortable”* **\[5.2\]**. Teachers stated that: 

  -  *""AIO made it possible to use inscriptions in courses where students do not know any Greek or not enough to read complicated inscriptions: unthinkable before\! Epigraphy has been made accessible to students whose majors is not classics or philology”*; 

  -  *“AIO has also made it much much easier to include Athenian inscriptions \(indeed epigraphic material at all\) in my teaching”*; 

  -  *“For teaching, a whole set of evidence is opened up to students that would otherwise never be able to work with it \- those who have no working knowledge of Greek”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 The online format also increased accessibility by removing the financial limitations of expensive specialist volumes; Boris Chubrasik \(Assistant Professor, University of Toronto\) notes that for teaching, the site is *“really transformative, as at this level, we used to have to ‘make do’ with very limited translated documents”* **\[5.3\]**. The notes, in a format unique to this database, are also reported by users to be particularly supportive of student learning. Professor Michele Faraguna \(University of Milan\) says it is *“a fundamental reference point”* in his teaching as *“the notes are in turn becoming more and more detailed and helpful”* **\[5.4\]**.  Another user states that *“the explanatory notes are really helpful. I think all of this combined helps students connect with and understand epigraphic evidence much better""* **\[5.2\]**. 

 Teachers have described the many ways in which they use the site in the classroom. For example, Sarah Holliday, Head of Classics at Aylesbury Grammar School \(UK\), describes AIO as *“a very helpful and easy to navigate tool for teaching A2 Ancient History \- Greece in Conflict. The translations are modern, all the details are on the screen, including references to literary sources, which is very helpful for worksheet creation\!”* **\[5.5\]**. Another teacher, responding anonymously to the site user survey, stated that they *“Used the site recently to prepare materials for a sixth form 'Classics extension trip' to the British Museum \- AIO was excellent for this”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 Two papers published on AIO aim to support teachers and students. AIO10 \(1,567 views to date **\[5.6\]**\) is a short guide to the materials available on the site by topic, whilst AIO8 discusses two inscriptions which are prescribed source material for OCR \(A\-level\) Ancient History. AIO8 has been the most visited content page on the site since publication in June 2017 \(8,997 views to date **\[5.6\]**\). Teachers identify how these have been used, for example: 

-  Holliday notes they *“gave me a greater level of context to the decrees and had a significant impact on my own understanding, which I was then able to pass on to my students”* **\[5.5\]**. 

-  Chubrasik states *“AIO8 certainly has a significant impact on my teaching of Greek history as I can now easily give this document to students to quickly read up both on the history, and the documents with up\-to\-date references. I have used AIO10 to guide graduate students into the way of teaching Greek history \(and inscriptions more broadly\), and I think it has been very effective”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 **4.4 Creation of other archives using AIO’s technical infrastructure** 

 AIO’s successful format and approach inspired the conception and development of Greek Inscriptions Online \(GIO\), a website run by the Greek Epigraphic Society and the Hellenic Educational and Research Centre. It is the first database of Modern Greek translations of inscriptions from across the Ancient Greek world for use by heritage and educational professionals in Greece **\[5.7, 5.8\]**. Andronike Makres, Director of GIO, states that *“AIO was the source of inspiration and the model for the creation of GIO”* **\[5.8\]**, and the homepage of GIO credits its infrastructure to AIO: *“AIO has made available its unique design and infrastructure to GIO, and the two sites work closely together, sharing epigraphic texts in Ancient Greek, as well as images and other data”* **\[5.8\]**. AIO committed staff time \(including that of the IT Director and the IT and coding assistant\) to setting up GIO and coding the initial set of texts **\[5.8\]**. 

 The sites share information so that Greek users can also access the English translations on AIO, and vice versa, which Makres notes as *a “meaningful and...fundamental operation for the user of the two databases”* **\[5.8\]**. GIO is awaiting further funding to add 150 inscriptions to expand its current database **\[5.8\]**. 

 In summary, Lambert’s research – via the annotated English translations on AIO – opened up access of Attic inscriptions to a diverse range of users around the world. Previously the preserve of specialists, Attic inscriptions are now illuminating the history of ancient Athens and the life of its inhabitants for multiple users, including heritage professionals, museum visitors, teachers, and students.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 NHS hospitals and services in the UK are assessed, in part, by performance\-related measurements \(statistics\) which ultimately affect their level of resource \(funding\). Errors in these measurements affect their reliability and, consequently, the assessments. Research into the identification, understanding and abrogating the effects of data on predictive models at University of Leicester \(UoL\) underpins the impact of this case study. The impact is in an **increased awareness and understanding** of inaccuracies within data including missing data and data from disparate sources and their effects on decision making within medical and operational applications within the NHS. As a direct consequence, NHS hospitals are now being assessed based on more accurate information. The beneficiaries are NHS hospitals nation\-wide, particularly via more accurately allocated Best Practice Tariff payments, and the patient population as a whole through better managed NHS resources. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prof Gorban and Dr Mirkes have been working in the area of data analysis and data mining for over 30 years, specifically working on the uncertainties which are inherent to any empirical data and critical assessment of standard statistical methods **\[R1–R6\]**. Uncertainties can arise from a variety of sources including missing values and as a result of combining data sets originating from different sources. Another challenge is the validity of standard statistical assumptions, e.g., the independence of variables, and quantifiable objectivity of data collection and recordings, such as human bias. 

 Missing records and values in datasets are widespread in nearly all real\-life data collections. It is typical and unavoidable in NHS and medical data. Researchers at UoL have been looking at this issue since 2013 when they were presented with the challenge of analysing the Trauma Audit Research Network \(TARN\) database. 

 TARN’s database is the richest injury database in Europe and holds records of the overall state of patients on their discharge date from hospital. TARN receives data on trauma events from more than 200 hospitals, including over 93% of the hospitals in England and Wales, as well as hospitals in Ireland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Current standard practice within the NHS assesses the quality of the patient’s state after major trauma on the basis of their survival 30 days after the initial injury. However, within this period, some patients are discharged or transferred to other hospitals resulting in incomplete information. Prior to **\[R5\]**, records with missing survival outcomes have either been ignored or taken as survived. Both of these approaches overlook the fact that missing values may or may not be independent, potentially resulting in misleading predictions **\[E1, p.6\-9\]**. 

 Due to these early transfers and discharges, outcomes for these patients for the entire duration of the 30\-day window are not registered. Another source of missing data is due to the initial state of the patient. For example, patients with severe trauma may not have all the observations taken at the point of entry due to the urgency of medical intervention. Similarly, patients with moderate injuries may not require the full spectrum of observations. An example of data structure in TARN is shown in Fig 1. Cases with identified unique or most critical injuries \(the top node of the tree\) are split into two groups: the group of patients who were admitted to a TARN hospital within 24 hours after the injury \(Main Group\); and the group of patients transferred to a TARN hospital more than 24 hours after injury \(Transferred\). The Main Group is then split into subgroups: the group of patients for whom an outcome was known within 30 days of the injury \(Available W30D\), and the group of patients transferred from a TARN hospital to a non\-TARN care provider during 30 days after the injury \(OUT30\). The Main Group is used to develop predictive modelling, and the Transferred group is used to verify modelling outcomes **\[R5\]**.

 Human bias and subjectivity often occurs at the patient’s point of entrance into the NHS system. The reliability of common decision\-making practices employed by NHS hospitals need to be scientifically justified. Nurses’ initial patient assessments can be subject to bias, especially in A&E departments. This bias can affect prioritisation of a patient and survival outcomes. For example, in 12 hospitals and 4 ambulance services in the UK, clinical decisions to refer a child to primary care or self\-care are based on the Paediatric Observation Priority Score \(POPS\). POPS supports clinical decisions, especially for staff not familiar with dealing with a child. POPS uses a combination of 8 physiological, behavioural, and known\-risk parameters: oxygen saturations, level of alertness, extent of breathing difficulty, background history, nurse gut feeling, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature. Some of these variables \(e.g., nurse gut feeling\) are clearly subjective, have human bias, and have never been assessed in a robust and rigorous way. The UoL study evidenced that despite the nature of the variables, POPS score is a sufficient indicator of the patient’s length of stay, thus demonstrating the reliability of the POPS score as a decision\-making tool **\[R6\]**.Gathering profiles of physical activity is key for monitoring health and well\-being of the general public, and patients at risk of cardiometabolic disease, obesity, and musculoskeletal health. Accelerometer data is increasingly used to collect this information. There are three widely used types of research\-grade accelerometers: GENEActiv, Axivity, and ActiGraph; with varying, possibly non\-fixed sampling frequencies. To use data from all devices, to increase the capability of data collection, and increase the power of health care research through increased sample sizes of studies, harmonisation is required. The research conducted by Dr Mirkes enables harmonisation of accelerometer data across different platforms, studies, and pooling of data **\[R3, R4\].**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact from the research is in terms of **increased awareness and understanding**. 

 **Leicester Diabetes Centre** 

 The Leicester Diabetes Centre is a world\-renowned, applied health research unit committed to improving the lives and care of people with diabetes and other long\-term conditions. Research on combining data from different disparate sources, subsequently reported in **\[R3, R4\]**, enabled clinicians working at the Diabetes centre *“to process accelerometer data from different devices using the same software \[which\] crucially reduced uncertainty in comparison of results found in different studies”* **\[E5\]**. The research *“shows which parts of the data collected by different type of accelerometers can be considered equivalent and thus considered inside of one study”* **\[E5\]**. 

 **Trauma Audit Research Network \(TARN\)** 

 Researchers at UoL have been working with TARN to improve the reliability of the modelling outcomes using their database. Prior to the underpinning research, records with missing survival outcomes have either been ignored or taken as survived. The research has revealed that ignoring missing data, or assuming that the data in the TARN dataset are missed at random, adversely affects predictive modelling of mortality rates. The UoL team developed a family of new models where mortality is based on non\-stationary Markov chains. These models take explicit account for missing data in clinical records. A distinctive feature is the presence of two ‘lotteries’: the *“lottery of death/discharge”* and the *“lottery of transfer”* **\[R5\]**. The implemented models allow explicit simulation of recovery, death, and transfer between TARN and out\-of\-TARN hospitals. 

 The team’s research on the TARN database revealed that the data on more than 11% \(around 19,289 patients\) of the patients are not accounted for in mortality estimates, and hence lead to a bias in NHS resource management. The fundamental research carried out by the team at UoL, through **increased awareness and understanding** of the importance of the effects of missing data, has enabled TARN and NHS resource managers to better manage and predict resource requirements. This is evidenced by practitioners within TARN who have recognised the benefits of the improved predictions **\[E2\]** and more general NHS practitioners. 

 The team’s research on the missing data and more accurate modelling, underpinned by the research subsequently reported in **\[R5, R6\]**, has directly improved the accuracy of hospital’s performance assessment nation\-wide. In particular, the UoL team showed, by using more accurate modelling of mortality rates, that ignoring missing data overestimates the rate of mortality by 12% \(200 deaths per year\). This research has *“increased \[TARN\] awareness and understanding of the fact that a missed attribute within the data may not be missed ‘at random’ or not independent on other attributes. . . . With this new level of understanding … TARN gained access to true mortality … TARN data is embedded in a novel system of quality\-based commissioning, being used to determine ‘Best Practice Tariff’ payments to hospitals nationally”* **\[E2\]**. As a direct consequence, NHS hospitals across the UK are now being assessed based on more accurate information and ‘Best Practice Tariff’ payments are more accurately allocated across the NHS. 

 **Paediatric Observation Priority Score \(POPS\)** 

 The research on POPS confirmed, for the first time, that despite the variables and measurements contributing to the POPS score being highly uncertain and having a fundamental variability in that they depend on the individual’s feeling about a patient’s state, the final POPS score is a reliable indicator of the patient’s length of stay and subsequent resources requirements. *“POPS is a unifying clinical decision tool, especially for staff not familiar with dealing with children”* **\[E3\]**. The impact of research is nation\-wide affecting 12 NHS hospitals and 4 ambulance services across the UK that use POPS, who collectively see around 300,000 children each year **\[E3\]**. *“Scoring systems in Emergency Departments \(EDs\) in the UK are rarely validated. POPS is a method of quantifying patient acuity, which is being used by 12 NHS Hospitals and 4 Ambulance Services around the UK. POPS identifies a range of severity of childhood illness, to support staff in taking the decision to redirect the child to primary care or discharge to self\-care and to help them in expediting senior/specialist assistance for deteriorating children. Importantly, POPS is not intended to determine a course of action but to support clinical decisions, especially for staff not familiar with dealing with children. . . . As a consequence of this increased awareness POPS is now more robust to the effects of missing data and uncertainty.”* **\[E3\]**. 

 Reliable data is always important in healthcare, but the confidence in POPS as an assessment tool, provided by research such as **\[R6\]** is increasingly important in the Covid\-19 pandemic. A recent study has reported that the use of POPS has led to an improved detection rate of Covid\-19 virus in children. *“Existing triage tools have good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in children with suspected COVID\-19. POPS … could achieve an appropriate balance of sensitivity and specificity for supporting decisions to discharge home by considering any score above zero to be positive.”* **\[E4\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Hydrogen Safety Engineering and Research \(HySAFER\) Centre’s research addressed key knowledge gaps and technological bottlenecks in the safety of hydrogen technologies. The research has informed science\-based Regulations, Codes and Standards \(RCS\), supporting deployment of technologies by providing the technical requirements to achieve safety. The impact is the adoption of Ulster research into international RCS. Specifically, HySAFER research has: 

1.  Informed International RCS through activities of Working Groups \(WGs\) of UN GTR\#13/IWG/SGS, CEN/CENELEC/JTC6 and ISO/TC197. 

1.  Supported deployment of hydrogen technologies through provision of safety guidance: European Guidelines on Fuel Cell Indoor Installation and Use; European Model Evaluation Protocol; and the European Emergency Response Guide. 

1.  Provided novel engineering tools of the e\-laboratory in Hydrogen Safety for stakeholders. 

1.  Devised design of innovative fire test protocol, invented breakthrough safety technology. 

1.  Impacted European funding priorities. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 HySAFER studies described in the seminal work by Molkov \(2012, **R2**\) **,** have been built upon research which began in 2000 and 30 externally funded projects in the area of hydrogen safety \(e.g. **G1** 2012\-15 **, G2** 2013\-18\). These include but are not limited to: the similarity law \(Molkov, **R2**\), the pressure peaking phenomenon \(PPP\) \(Brennan/Molkov/Makarov/Shentsov\), correlations for vented deflagrations including non\-uniform and localised mixtures \(Molkov/Makarov\), dimensionless jet\-flame length correlation \(Molkov, **R2**\), hydrogen inventory limit for a warehouse\-like space \(Makarov/Molkov\) and passive ventilation theory \(Molkov/Shentsov, **R1**\). 

 Key knowledge gaps have been addressed including a contemporary computational fluid dynamics \(CFD\) model for dynamics of blast wave and fireball after hydrogen tank rupture in a fire in the open atmosphere, most recently published \(Molkov/Cirrone/Shentsov/Makarov, **R6**\), a reduced model \(Makarov/Shentsov/Molkov\) and a CFD model for the PPP for jet fires \(Brennan/Hussein/Makarov/Shentsov/Molkov, **R5**\). Considerable work has been completed to understand the behaviour of a high\-pressure tank in a fire; this has included a conjugate heat transfer CFD model and theoretical blast wave decay theory. The study on thermally protected tanks is completed \(Makarov/Kashkarov/Molkov, **R4**\). The *significance* and *reach* of the HySAFER research is in breakthrough safety strategies and innovative engineering solutions, e.g. explosion free in a fire composite tank without thermally activated pressure relief device \(TPRD\) as per EU patent application No.18706224.5 dated 05/09/19, which are utilised by stakeholders globally. External grants \(Section 3\) amalgamating research, education/training, and outreach activities underpin the significance, rigour and originality of the research to inform international RCS \( **I1**\). 

 Hazard distances from hydrogen systems have cost implications arising from land values. Before Ulster work, no validated models existed to estimate hazard distances from a fireball and blast wave following rupture of storage vessels at pressures up to 100 Megapascals \(MPa\) in a fire.  It was demonstrated for the first time in 2015 \(Molkov/Kashkarov\) and confirmed recently by detailed numerical study \(Molkov/Cirrone/Shentsov/Makarov, **R6**\) that the assessment of hazard distances must account for contribution of hydrogen combustion at contact surface to the blast wave strength. This research paved the way to understanding of a slow decay of blast wave and unacceptably high velocity of fireball propagation, which led to the HyTunnel\-CS funding \( **G5** 2019\-22\). Research on IP\-protected breakthrough safety technology on explosion free in a fire TPRD\-less tanks \( **G2** 2013\-18 **, G3** 2017\-19\) with industrial partners Hexagon\-Lincoln \(USA\), Sherwin\-Williams \(UK\), Pro\-Science \(Germany\), Optimum CT \(USA\) and Authorised Testing \(USA\) solved the problem of devastating consequences after tank rupture in a fire \(including blast wave, fireball, projectiles\). The use of two composites in the load\-bearing wall with properties defined by Intellectual Property allows the hydrogen\-impermeable liner to melt and start release of hydrogen in a form of microleaks through the wall before tank rupture. This multi\-disciplinary inter\-sectoral study highlighted the importance of the revealed tank failure mechanism in fire and led to the breakthrough leak\-no\-burst safety technology for hydrogen storage composite tanks for onboard and stationary applications \( **I4**\). Three different series of prototypes of TPRD\-less tanks were successfully manufactured and tested in the USA. At the same time the influence of specific heat release rate on fire resistance rating and test reproducibility in different laboratories was discovered, underlining the need for change in the fire test protocol of the Global technical regulation on hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles \(GTR\#13\) \( **I1**\). 

 Ulster with Maryland \(USA\) developed passive ventilation theory, enhancing safety by correcting previous faulty engineering methodology which either underestimated hydrogen concentration in air twice for lean mixtures or overestimated twice for rich mixtures \(Molkov/Shentsov, **R1**\). 

 Previous research demonstrated that structural integrity can be compromised by PPP \(Brennan/Molkov, **R2**\). Recently the PPP for experimental ignited releases has been investigated theoretically and numerically, and highlighted safety concerns in high\-pressure storage previously considered “safe”. The numerical study \(Brennan/ Shentsov/ Makarov/Molkov, **R5**\) gave insights into the phenomenon. Recommendations to improve the technology have been realised by OEMs, e.g. Daimler and Toyota reduced their TPRD diameter to 2mm. The requirement to address the PPP is implemented in ISO standards \( **I1**\), and an engineering tool of e\-Laboratory to predict overpressure during an ignited release was developed \( **G4** 2017\-2021\). 

 Localised vented deflagrations and their mitigation techniques were not studied until recently \(Makarov/Molkov **, R3**\). The theoretical model was developed and validated against HSE \(UK\) and KIT \(Germany\) experiments. The study revealed that only a fast\-burning fraction of non\-uniform flammable mixture contributes to the maximum vented deflagration overpressure. Ulster’s unique CFD deflagration model is used by industry and academia in Canada, Greece, Japan, Poland, and UK \(Shell\) \( **I3**\) informing safe design of Fuel Cell and Hydrogen \(FCH\) systems and infrastructure. A thermodynamic model for deflagration overpressure in closed space such as a warehouse was developed and validated which shows that hydrogen inventory in an enclosure without vents should not exceed the amount that, when divided by the enclosure volume, gives an average volumetric concentration below 0.3% by volume \(Makarov/Molkov, **R3**\), i.e. far below the lower flammability limit of 4% by volume.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The significance of the research is through informing RCS including UN ECE GTR\#13, ISO and EU standards and pan\-European guidance documents. The research also underpinned the development of the e\-Laboratory of Hydrogen Safety, composed mainly of Ulster’s models/tools, impacted upon funding priorities in hydrogen safety research. 

 **I1: Informed international science\-based RCS** 

 CEN/CENELEC/JTC6 Hydrogen in Energy Systems \(WG3 Hydrogen Safety\) suggested in June 2020 a New Work Item Proposal “Safe use of hydrogen in built constructions” based on HyIndoor \( **G1**\) and HyTunnel\-CS \( **G5**\) project outcomes. The importance of Ulster’s work is evidenced by the CEN/CENELEC/JTC6 secretariat \( **C1**\) who confirms they *“have seen the clear impact of the pre\-normative research \(PNR\) work carried out at HySAFER of Ulster University on standard development”* *… “The PNR outputs of the HySAFER\-led project HyTunnel\-CS are directly informing standard development”.* 

 International standard ISO 19880\-1 “Gaseous hydrogen \- Fuelling stations \- Part 1: General requirements” uses the HySAFER’s term “hazard distance” which is deterministic and can be calculated by Ulster’s tools. This standard recommends “thermal shielding” for storage vessels based on the underpinning research at HySAFER on vehicle tanks \( **G2** 2013\-18 **, G3** 2017\-19\). ISO 19882 “Gaseous hydrogen land vehicle fuel tanks and TPRDs” has drastically changed requirements for ventilation systems. It now requires accounting for the PPP discovered at Ulster. ISO/TR 15916:2015 “Basic considerations for the safety of hydrogen systems” cites the seminal book by Molkov \( **R2**\) as a key reference. The “ *strong*” impact of HySAFER research on ISO standards, and development of inherently safer hydrogen systems, is acknowledged by the Chairperson of ISO/TC197 \( **C3**\) who notes the *“outstanding research work carried out at HySAFER, in particular on models and tools for assessment of hazard distances, the pressure peaking phenomenon, and safety of storage tanks has been incorporated into publicly accessible safety documentation*”. This is echoed by the Chair of Hydrogen Europe RCS Strategy Coordination Group who confirms the impact HySAFER research has had on RCS globally **\(C2\).** 

 The GTR\#13 \(Phase 2\) accounts for Ulster’s contributions to the fire test protocol. The control of specific heat release rate in a fire source \(HRR/A\) has led to drastically improved fire test reproducibility. HySAFER research on the significance of HRR/A is publicly accessible through the GTR Informal Working Group, Sub\-Group Safety **\(C4\).** The significance of the GTR\#13 stems from its EU\-wide legally binding status. 

 These documents facilitate the safer deployment of hydrogen vehicles and refuelling infrastructure, improve testing procedures, and impact OEMs worldwide. They are used by the hydrogen industry with a global reach and its significance is in setting the benchmark for the safety of hydrogen\-powered vehicles. 

 **I2: Industry\-relevant guidance** 

 HySAFER has provided technical safety requirements through industry\-relevant guidance: European Guidelines on Fuel Cell Indoor Installation and Use; European Model Evaluation Protocol; and European Emergency Response Guide. 

 Collaboration with Air Liquide \(France\) and partners within the HyIndoor project \( **G1** 2012\-2015\) resulted in industry\-led European Guidelines \( **C5**\). Ulster’s engineering models/tools are presented in the Guidelines including: design of ventilation systems, mitigation of deflagrations in enclosures by limitation of hydrogen inventory, recommendations for vent sizing of enclosures fully and partially filled in by hydrogen\-air mixtures, and effect of flow restrictors. The Guidelines’ importance is highlighted by a senior scientist at Air Liquide \( **C6**\) who notes the *“industry\-led guidelines have impact upon hydrogen safety engineering worldwide and assist in underpinning the safe deployment of hydrogen infrastructure”*. The significance of the guidance is in providing a compendium of information with a reach across a variety of stakeholders. 

 Ulster made a substantial technical contribution to the “European Emergency Response Guide \(EERG\)” led by the French Fire Academy \(ENSOSP\). It incorporates HySAFER’s tools for the prediction of hazard distances of unignited release, flame length, blast wave and fireball. This guide is used by emergency response personnel globally, its value is corroborated by the Lead of Training at ENSOSP \( **C7**\) who states how “ *through HyResponse ENSOSP are recognised as the leading providers of hydrogen safety training for responders in Europe, our unique operational training is complemented by the research\-led educational training provided by Ulster University. The current Ulster led HyResponder project is enabling us to maximise the reach and impact of our training and update EERG by new research findings and use of the online e\-Laboratory of Hydrogen Safety created mainly on the basis of models developed and validated at HySAFER”*. 

 **I3: Unique engineering tools** 

 The e\-Laboratory of Hydrogen Safety incorporates numerous engineering tools based on Ulster’s publications. The e\-Laboratory developed within the NET\-Tools project beginning in 2017 \( **G4**\) is freely available online to stakeholders around the globe. Specific examples of how the tools have impact include: prevention of destruction of civil structures through limitation of the PPP, and calculation of hazard distances. The e\-Laboratory has been recognised by the EC's Innovation Radar as a Key Innovation, “ *addressing the needs of existing markets*” **\(C8\)**. The e\-Laboratory is used across a range of sectors. Industrial gas company Air Liquide uses Ulster’s blast wave decay nomograms along with other tools to inform their safe design of hydrogen systems and infrastructure. The PPP and vehicle tank design and safety requirements have been important in influencing safety considerations in applications of electrolyzer manufacturer ITM Power, and the e\-Laboratory is being used to maximise the reach and impact of training at ENSOSP \( **C7**\). 

 **I4: Design of novel test protocols, patented breakthrough safety technologies** 

 HySAFER research demonstrated that the risk of hydrogen\-powered vehicles is acceptable on London roads if the onboard tank fire resistance is above 50 minutes or tank rupture in a fire is excluded. Ulster’s breakthrough safety technology of explosion free in a fire TPRD\-less tank fully excludes tank rupture in a fire and thus eliminates its devastating consequences. The work has been funded through a series of grants from 2017 onwards with examples given in Section 3 \(e.g. **G3, G5**\). This technology allows the use of hydrogen vehicles in tunnels and underground parking at risk below of that for fossil fuel vehicles. This IP solution is licenced, most recently by US based Optimum Composite Technologies LLC. Optimum specialises in the design, fabrication and production of alternative fuel cylinders and is focused on the development of compressed gas tanks for aftermarket automotive and OEM applications \( **C9**\). 

 **I5: European funding priorities** 

 The European hydrogen industry \(Hydrogen Europe\) formulates requirements for industry\-driven safety research through the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking \(FCH JU\) calls. The European Hydrogen Safety Panel \(EHSP\), including Molkov, advises FCH JU and the International Association for Hydrogen Safety \(IA HySafe\), including Ulster as a founding member and Molkov as Chair of Education Committee, and publishes Reference Reports on Research Priorities that influence the EC’s funding priorities. The importance of Ulster’s research in informing funding priorities is corroborated by the Chair of EHSP and IA HySafe Executive Committee member \( **C10**\), who states *“research at HySAFER, particularly on use of hydrogen indoors, CFD protocols and best practices, safety of liquefied hydrogen, and safety of hydrogen in confined spaces have been reflected in our research priority discussions and reports and have been used to inform the FCH JU Multi\-Annual Implementation Plan 2016\-2019 and related funding calls”.* 

 Overall, the work at HySAFER has contributed directly to the inherently safer engineering of hydrogen and fuel cell systems and infrastructure through tools, innovations, and RCS.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Kapanidis developed and commercialised a unique fluorescence microscope for single\-molecule imaging, the Nanoimager. Although other microscopes of this type exist, the Nanoimager is significantly smaller, much simpler to operate, and around 30\-50% of the cost. The microscope and associated software reveal the distribution, structures and motions of biomolecules and nanoparticles on surfaces, in solution and in living cells, accelerating academic and industrial research, diagnostics, drug discovery, chemical analysis, and education. Custom software, services and assays for the detection of specific target entities have been developed for several applications in academia and industry. For example, detection of COVID\-19 in clinical samples, substantially faster than existing rapid diagnostic tests, is being developed commercially. The Nanoimager was commercialised via the spinout Oxford Nanoimaging \(ONI\) in 2016. ONI has rapidly grown to 98 employees, expanded to the USA and has sold microscopes worldwide exceeding GBP5,000,000 annually.

###  Invention of Nanoimager \(2005 – 2016\) 

 The invention of single\-molecule fluorescence methods revolutionized biophysics and molecular biology by breaking the diffraction limit in microscopy, offering real\-time views of biochemical reactions and enabling ultrasensitive detection. When Kapanidis joined Oxford \(2005\) he began pursuing miniaturised single\-molecule imaging \(first grant in 2006\): the initial goal was to produce desktop devices that would replace the unstable and cumbersome microscopes, occupying entire rooms and requiring laser interlocks and massive optical tables, that were the only devices then available. In 2009, Kapanidis refocused on wide\-field microscopy **\[1\]** to offer higher throughput and biological context for localisation\-based super\-resolution microscopy **\[2, 3\].** Initial work on miniaturised microscopy was pursued with the company Chelsea Technologies Group. In 2011, the Kapanidis group completed a proof\-of\-concept bench\-top wide\-field microscope; in 2013, Kapanidis and his student Bo Jing came up with several innovations and a radically new design, the first successful ‘Nanoimager’ prototype and associated software **\[4\]**. 

###  Antimicrobial Resistance \(AMR\) 

 The Nanoimager device has been used to carry out single\-molecule analysis of double\-stranded DNA in living bacteria to improve understanding of how double\-strand breakages are repaired. This is crucial to understand how bacteria can become resistant to clinically relevant antibiotics that produce DNA breakages. This research had the objectives of identifying the mode of action of existing and potential new antimicrobial lead compounds that target chromosomes and DNA\-binding proteins in bacteria, and of using the Nanoimager to develop a rapid antimicrobial\-susceptibility test to evaluate the response of bacteria from individual patients to antibiotic treatments; faster tests allow more rapid and informed decisions on patient treatment and help avoid the use of broad\-spectrum antibiotics treatments that exacerbate antibiotic resistance. The technique developed uses bright\-field and ultra\-sensitive fluorescence microscopy to examine the observable properties \(phenotypes\) of a single cell in the absence and presence of antibiotics and determine whether bacteria are antibiotic\-resistant or susceptible. This information is combined with bacterial identification and detection of gene expression associated with antimicrobial resistance through highly multiplexed single\-molecule fluorescence in\-situ hybridization \(a method for detecting and localizing specific DNA and RNA sequences\).  These techniques, together with the Nanoimager, were then used for research on the influenza virus, and more recently on SARS\-CoV\-2, the virus that causes COVID\-19. 

###  Influenza and COVID\-19 Virus Testing 

 Kapanidis and Robb discovered a novel, calcium\-mediated interaction by which the surface of viruses can be enveloped with DNA and labelled by fluorophores attached to the DNA **\[5\]**. This enabled rapid \(in one minute\) and sensitive labelling and detection of influenza and other viruses using single\-particle tracking and particle\-size determination \(patent GB1817802.0\). Work to combine this non\-specific optical assay with virus\-specific labelling approaches \(aptamers, hybridization probes and antibodies\) was then applied to the emerging SARS\-CoV\-2 at the beginning of 2020 as the outbreak grew to a pandemic. A team including Robb and Kapanidis and their student Shiaelis worked with collaborators at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford to develop a methodology using the Nanoimager for virus identification via a convolutional neural network; after the network is trained on large sets of images of single particles of different viruses, the network can identify the presence of a specific virus in biological and clinical samples by being able to identify the presence of specific viral particles in sets of images from these samples. The assay \(patent GB2006144.6\) achieves labelling, imaging and virus identification in less than five minutes; the trained neural network is able to differentiate SARS\-CoV\-2 from negative clinical samples, as well as from other common respiratory pathogens such as influenza and seasonal human coronaviruses, with accuracies ranging from 70\-95% per individual particle, leading to high confidence \(>99%\) in identifying virus\-positive samples with significant viral load **\[6\]**.

###  Oxford Nanoimaging 

 Between 2005 and 2015, large microscope companies modified their products to offer commercial microscopes to the growing numbers of biologists who wanted access to super\-resolution imaging \(a technique recognized by the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\). Such microscopes allowed scientists in academia and industry to study individual molecules, even inside living cells, and distinguish structures as small as 10 to 20nm – less than one fifth the size of a flu virus. However, these instruments are largely inaccessible to most researchers in academia and industry due to their high cost \(GBP250,000 to GBP500,000\), complexity and the infrastructure and know\-how required to house and operate them. Further, apart from super\-resolution imaging, the commercial instruments do not offer many options for single\-molecule detection, thus severely limiting the application of single\-molecule methods in biosensing and drug discovery, and preventing industrial scientists from exploiting the high sensitivity of these methods as well as their ability to monitor directly molecular interactions and conformational changes. The industrial and scientific community needed compact, robust and affordable microscopes and software, effective in any environment e.g., biochemistry labs, hospitals, and quality\-control industrial labs. To meet these needs, Oxford Nanoimaging \(ONI\) was founded by Kapanidis and Jing in May 2016 to manufacture and sell the Nanoimager. The design featured two modules \(each with a footprint of less than an A4 page\) linked with optical fibres: the excitation module included three lasers in the visible wavelength range; the microscopy module included most of the optics for sample excitation as well as for the detection of the fluorescence emission. Crucially, the microscopy module featured a single aluminium plate \(size only: 20cm x 22.5cm x 1.2cm\) that acted as a miniaturised optical table, to which all optics and the sCMOS camera were attached, utilising both top and bottom surfaces. The integrated construction, along with the very small size of the microscope and the short distance of the optical paths from the surface of the motherboard \(1 to 3cm\), minimised the relative motion between optical components. This, together with a vibration\-absorbing gel \(linking the motherboard to the microscope module housing\), provided outstanding vibration isolation and very low thermal drift in all three dimensions. 

 The first prototype also featured a novel and inexpensive way to achieve autofocus, involving a 780nm laser beam coupled to a multi\-mode fibre to produce a focused spot at the glass/sample interface. When imaged on the sCMOS camera, any axial motion of the sample was identified as a widening of the scattered image of the beam. This could be rectified after comparison with a set of calibration images by sample motion using a piezo stage. Combined with close temperature control this gives extraordinary stability, showing lateral and axial drifts that greatly outperform other microscopes. In 2015, the team developed the second prototype, which combined outstanding spatial\-temporal resolution, even better stability \(by means of a novel drift\-cancelling geometry for the sample stage, further minimising any remaining thermal drift and achieving very low lateral and axial drifts \(which are 30nm hr<sup>\-1</sup>K<sup>\-1</sup> and less than 1nm hr<sup>\-1</sup>K<sup>\-1</sup>, respectively\), while maintaining the small size \(a shoebox\-size microscope module and a desktop\-tower module for lasers/electronics\). This version of the Nanoimager was also able to localise individual molecules with a resolution of 20nm, track single molecules and vesicles inside cells and in free solution, and enabled use of single\-molecule fluorescence\-detected resonance energy transfer \(smFRET\) for the characterisation of specific molecular interactions and intra\-molecular dynamics. Since the Nanoimager is laser\-safe, it is also ideal for outreach and teaching. 

 Jing joined ONI as Chief Technology Officer and is now CEO; Kapanidis became a board director and consultant. Since its formation in 2016, ONI has attracted GBP22,400,000 **\[A\]** in investment, had 98 employees \(headcount: 98\) in 2019 \(up from 60 in 2018\) **\[B\]** and achieved a turnover of GBP5,115,000 in 2019 \(up from GBP2,832,000 in 2018\) **\[B\]**. This rapid growth has seen expansion to the USA with a base in California. The Nanoimager still uses many UK parts, stimulating the local economy. ONI has recorded numerous microscope sales worldwide \(UK, US, Italy, Netherlands, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Australia etc.\) and many early adopters purchased additional units. In recognition of this success, ONI won the “Start\-up of the Year” award of the Institute of Physics **\[C\]** and was chosen as a Fast\-Track\-100 company by the Sunday Times **\[D\]**, both in 2018. Kapanidis and Jing also won the BBSRC “Innovator of the Year” award in 2019 in both the commercial and overall winner categories **\[E\]**.

###  Wide Range of Users 

 The Nanoimager offers a wide range of single\-molecule fluorescence capabilities \(single\-molecule localization and tracking, super\-resolution imaging, single\-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer \(smFRET\), single\-cell fluorescence\), and has served as a platform for further development of microscope hardware by ONI, including structured illumination microscopy and microfluidics. Nanoimagers are integrated with dedicated software, services and assays for several applications in academia and industry, some of which are detailed below. Medical diagnostics and drug discovery have been immediate beneficiaries, with users in universities, medical schools, and national research institutes. For example, the Head of IMAXT laboratory at Cancer Research UK, who uses the Nanoimager to help build 3D versions of breast tumours to improve tumour diagnosis and treatment, said “ *We really hope that what we are doing is going to be the foundation of new discoveries, a new understanding of better ways to diagnose and treat tumours*” **\[F\]**. An oncologist at the Sheffield Medical School commented that: *“The Nanoimager brings single molecule measurements out of the dark room and into any research lab. The Nanoimager is stable, sensitive and affordable allowing researchers to quickly get to grips with performing their measurements”* **\[G\]** *.* The Nanoimager has also been adopted for microbiology work, as it is compatible with constrained environments such as Biosafety\-level II/III/IV spaces in clinical microbiology labs and public\-health institutes: e.g. from a scientist at the MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection where non\-pathogenic and pathogenic *E. coli* are studied: “ *Single molecule microscopy is in fact a game changer for us. The Nanoimager is extremely user\-friendly”* **\[H\]**. 

 The Nanoimager has been attractive for industry, including pharmaceutical companies working on drug\-discovery platforms and antibiotic development, DNA\-sequencing companies that require nanoscale characterisation of their substrates, and biotech companies pursuing disease biomarkers. Evox Therapeutics Ltd are creating novel therapeutics for the treatment of rare and severe diseases; the Co\-Founder and Chief Operating Officer commented: *“Evox Therapeutics Ltd, an Oxford\-based exosome therapeutics company, has used the Nanoimager extensively over the last couple of years. As a company carrying out exosome\-focused research and development the Nanoimager forms an integral part of our analytical suite of instrumentation and it plays an important role in studying and characterising, for instance, exosome internalisation and trafficking in target cells and drug loading into exosomes, and in the development of extended product characterisation criteria for future regulatory submissions. The use of the Nanoimager has furthered our understanding of exosome biology and the application of exosomes as therapeutics and the images it produces often feature in our presentations and posters, helping to simplify, visualise and communicate the potential and power of exosome biology”* **\[I\]**.  Furthermore, Astra Zeneca has collaborated with ONI to develop single\-molecule assays for drug discovery. “ *We use single\-molecule fluorescence to study the interactions of our protein targets with other proteins and small molecules...The NanoImager allows us to easily monitor ternary complex formation using purified proteins via immobilisation of one of the partner proteins to a chemically modified surface. The single\-molecule method requires very small amounts of sample and contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of action of our molecules… it is a very impactful tool to accelerate a drug discovery process*”, commented the Vice President, Global Head of Structural Biology, Biophysics and Fragment\-Based Lead Generation at Astra Zeneca **\[J\]**. 

###  COVID\-19 Testing 

 Kapanidis and Robb led a multidisciplinary programme to develop an assay that achieved labelling, imaging \(using the Nanoimager\) and virus identification in less than 5 minutes without requiring any lysis, purification or amplification steps. *""The collaboration between Achilles Kapanidis' ""Gene Machines"" laboratory and ourselves \(Derrick Crook, Nicole Stoesser\) in the Modernising Medical Microbiology consortium/Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust came about through a proof\-of\-principle project to develop a single\-cell nanoimaging approach to rapid bacterial pathogen diagnostics and phenotyping... The onset of the pandemic led to a new opportunity to deploy the Nanoimager in the John Radcliffe Hospital in order to be used for proof\-of\-principle work in developing a new rapid diagnostic approach to diagnosing SARS\-CoV\-2 in respiratory samples, using a method developed by Nicole Robb and Nicolas Shiaelis""* **\[K\].** This assay was the founding Intellectual Property for the formation of separate new spin\-out company, Oxford Rapid Diagnostic Technologies \(ORDTech\), to develop and commercialise the assay technology **\[L\]**. 

 Separately from Kapanidis and Robb and independently of Oxford University, ONI has been funded by Innovate UK to work with the Medicines Discovery Catapult and Imperial College London’s Healthcare NHS Trust on testing and deployment of their own new single\-step SARS\-CoV\-2 detection assay, which will allow direct swab testing by placing a nasal/pharyngeal sample into a collection tube containing a viral lysis/labelling buffer. This assay differs from that used by Kapanidis and Robb but also runs on the Nanoimager with results in under 10 minutes and has the potential to boost national testing capacity **\[M\]**.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers at the University of Strathclyde developed a low\-cost smartphone add\-on to be used by community operators for the imaging of the back of the eye. The device was trialled in African countries \(2013\-14\) and made available commercially through a spin out company from 2016. The innovation has been described as exemplary in World Health Organization guidelines. Research led to further innovations in technology for telemedicine, rolled out in several Scottish NHS boards, where it has reduced the need for travel to and wait for appointments, reduced costs, improved the service to patients, with earlier identification of urgent cases. Stimulated by the COVID\-19 response, the technology has been introduced into national policy and in platforms with global distribution. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2019, the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) reported that globally at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. This is more prevalent in low\- and middle\-income countries, in older people and in rural communities. The rapidly increasing demand mandates shifting eye care from secondary care to the community, especially in low\-resource settings. Retinal imaging is frequently used in the diagnosis and monitoring of eye disease, such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and age\-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, and systemic diseases, such as hypertension and malaria. Researchers at the University of Strathclyde, in collaboration with an NHS ophthalmologist, designed a method of adapting a smartphone into a low\-cost retinal imaging device. The aim was that such a device could be used with minimal training and in locations with limited diagnostic resources. 

 A series of these devices were designed and fabricated in Strathclyde in 2014 and sent to academic collaborators at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for field trials in Kenya, Tanzania and Mali. Strathclyde researchers performed the necessary adaptations to the field conditions, operating both from Scotland and in the field. Through this process of lab based design and field trials, the researchers developed an ophthalmoscopy adapter, composed of a plastic shell which attaches to the back of a smartphone, and provides a high\-resolution view of the retina through an un\-dilated pupil. \[ **R1**\]. The phone camera is held close to the front of the eye, and the phone camera flash, or an auxiliary light source, is deflected through the optical assembly to provide images of the retina. These retinal images can then be transmitted to remote evaluation centres for diagnosis. A validation study compared the grading of optic nerves from smartphone images taken by a lay photographer with those of a digital retinal camera taken by an ophthalmic assistant \[ **R2**\]. 

 Participants were recruited from Jan 2013 to Mar 2014 in the follow\-up phase of a population\-based cohort study on eye disease in Kenya. 2152 images from both devices were sent to Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, where a masked grader graded the images, including providing a vertical optic disk to cup ratio \(VCDR; the measure used to diagnose glaucoma\). No statistically significant difference in grading or VCDR was found between the digital retinal camera and the smart\-phone acquired images. This showed that the device could record accurate footage of the back of the eye for remote diagnosis and that the autofocussing properties of a smartphone camera can be harnessed to increase ease of use and reduce the need for specialist imaging training. 

 This technology was subsequently enhanced to suit the context of Accident and Emergency \(A&E\) and Minor Injuries units in hospitals, where non\-specialists often need to refer patients to specialist secondary care \[ **R3**\]. This system was further developed and complemented by a slit\-lamp microscope fitted with a low cost camera to the eyepiece. Using a 3D printed mount to maintain stability, the system can be adapted to suit the smartphone or tablet of choice. The technology has been deployed as part of the COVID\-19 response, and data has been collected and in the process of being analysed, demonstrating sufficient advantages to inform national policy \[ **R4**\].

The initial development of the technology was trialled, and performance verified in African countries, in collaboration with London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The ‘Peek Retina’ device was then commercialised and sold through a spin out company. Further advances were made at Strathclyde in collaboration with an NHS consultant ophthalmologist, to develop a system which would be suitable for remote diagnosis of eye problems in NHS or other primary care settings. Remote consultation and diagnosis were found to be of particular benefit to patients and practitioners during the COVID\-19 pandemic, reducing the need for travel and personal interaction. Specifically this research has: 

-  **Informed the design, development and delivery of innovative diagnostic technology for low\- and middle\-income countries**, leading to economic benefits for a spin\-out company and improved eye care provision. 

-  **Improved the efficiency and quality of eye care within NHS healthcare contexts**, with use in three NHS Scotland Health Boards. 

-  **Supported effective eye care provision during the COVID\-19 pandemic**, reducing travel requirements for patients and ensuring patient and practitioner safety. 

-  **Informed national policy and planning for  teleophthalmology services** in Scotland and England 

 **Informing the design, development and delivery of innovative diagnostic technology for low\- and middle\-income countries** 

 Retinal cameras remain impractical as a diagnostic tool in many low\-income countries and remote primary care settings throughout the world because of high cost, large size, low portability, lack of infrastructure \(e.g. electricity and road access\), and the need for trained staff. The smartphone\-based adapter designed at Strathclyde aimed to overcome these barriers. A plastic clip covers the telephone camera and flash with a prism assembly, which deflects light from the flash to match the illumination path with the field of view of the camera to acquire images of the retina. The phone camera and clip are held in front of and close to the eye, which allows the camera to capture images of the back of the eye. In 2014, the smartphone adapter, named Peek Retina, was awarded Digital Design of the Year by the Design Museum, London, with judges stating: ‘It’s a great example of how digital design can make a difference in remote healthcare. It uses high design and high technology for a really fundamental purpose, which is ideally to make people’s lives better.’ \[ **S1**\] In 2015, the device won an Index “Design to Improve Life” award specifically dedicated to projects with paradigm\-shifting global societal impact, alongside Tesla and Duolingo as other category winners \[ **S1**\]. The International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness lists the device in its list of validated diagnostic equipment and the World Health Organisation cites the device as an exemplary case study in its 2016 report on global diffusion of eHealth, highlighting that ‘the potential for task shifting and the detection of avoidable causes of blindness in the most at\-risk communities makes this an attractive public health intervention’ \[ **S1**\]. 

###  In 2016, Peek Vision Ltd. was set up to transfer the technology to commercial availability, as a spin\-off from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, with research\-based expertise from Strathclyde and Strathclyde co\-authors then employed at the company to support research and development. This translated Peek Retina into a commercial tool for screening eye disease, initially aimed at solving problems of eye disease in low\- and middle\-income countries. Peek Retina became commercially available in 2017 and has been distributed to 72 countries \[S2\] including Tanzania, Botswana, Malawi, Madagascar and Mali. Between 2017 and 2020, Peek Vision Ltd received over GBP100,000 in sales of Peek Retina \[S2\]. In late 2018, Peek Vision entered into a multinational partnership with CBM, a leading disability charity which works with eye health implementers worldwide, and in 2019, CBM, Peek Vision and implementing partners launched community eye health programmes in Zimbabwe and Pakistan \[S2, S3\]. In September 2020, Peek Vision Ltd closed sales of Peek Retina to focus on other smartphone apps and technology to support eye health programmes, but Peek Retina continues to be used in community healthcare settings globally. 

###  Improving the efficiency and quality of eye care within NHS healthcare contexts 

 In partnership with NHS Forth Valley, Strathclyde researchers made further advances to the Peek Retina system to allow remote consultation with an eye specialist in NHS settings. The first examination for an eye problem in the UK is likely to be made by an optometrist or General Practitioner, and even in Accident & Emergency \(A&E\) Departments, eye emergencies are first seen by a non\-specialist and then referred to a consultant for follow\-up. 

 In 2018, the initial design was augmented with a 3D printed modification of a slit\-lamp microscope which emits an intense beam of light to examine the eye \[ **R3**\]. The addition of teleconferencing software with audio feed enabled person\-to\-person conversations, and relay of images from diagnostic instruments in real time. Both ophthalmoscope and slit lamp provided images through an iPad. These innovative system and service aspects were interfaced to the Near Me Video Consultation Platform of NHS Scotland, providing a live feed between the patient, the on\-site clinician and the remote ophthalmologist \[ **S4**\]. Following consultation, actions can be taken as required, for example an urgent appointment or surgery can be arranged, or prescriptions can be sent directly to the GP, by the specialist clinician. 

 A trial of the technology in NHS settings in Stirling and Forth Valley began in April 2018, resulting in faster treatment times and significant reductions in the need for follow up hospital appointments. As a result, by August 2019 the technology was embedded in practice in A&E at Forth Valley Royal Hospital, in the Minor Injuries Unit at Stirling Health and Care Village, and was used by all seven on\-call consultants within NHS Forth Valley \[ **S4**\]. NHS Forth Valley received more than 80 video referrals for urgent eye problems in this one year period, with the need for a second appointment removed in an estimated 50 per cent of cases \[ **S4**\]. In 2019, the trial was expanded to A&E at Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, one of Scotland’s busiest A&E departments, and to NHS Grampian. There have been many advantages for both patients and practitioners, with clinicians and optometrists stating \[ **S4**\]: 

-  ‘When a colleague needs a steer on what to do, we can have a live view through their equipment, and connect them with a more nuanced plan, often preventing a trek to the eye clinic, and hours of waiting in a second waiting room.’ 

-  ‘The system means that emergency cases are identified earlier and theatre teams can be mobilised more quickly, with treatment starting immediately when needed.’ 

-  ‘Instead of having to transport the patients to hospital, it allows remote areas to access emergency eye care, thus promoting healthcare equality.’ 

-  ‘Patients can get quite anxious, but if they can get a face to face consultation with an ophthalmologist and get things explained to them it can help put their mind at rest. If they do need hospital treatment, they get put into the appropriate clinic more quickly.’ 

###  Supporting effective eye care provision during the COVID\-19 pandemic 

 Scottish Government made GBP3,000,000 available to support emergency eye care measures during the COVID\-19 pandemic and reduce the need for patients to attend hospital \[ **S5**\]. The roll out of the slit\-lamp microscope and teleconferencing software was part of this response. The NHS Consultant Ophthalmologist who collaborated with Giardini in the research projects was appointed by the Scottish Government as National Lead for Teleophthalmology in March 2020 and called as a member of the Expert Working Committee writing the NHS Scotland National Eye Health Framework for the Coronavirus \(COVID\-19\) Pandemic \[ **S6**\]. This policy framework recommends the innovations co\-developed with Strathclyde as part of its national framework for care, noting that ‘the gold standard of assessment is via video slit lamp. Teleophthalmology is also invaluable for more remote parts of the country to avoid unnecessary travel. Evidence suggests that most patients will be given advice and treatment without the need for a face\-to\-face examination.’ \[ **S6**\] 

 The National Lead for Teleophthalmology confirms that: ‘In close collaboration with Dr Giardini, we rapidly adapted local services in April 2020, activating optometric practices matched to population density across NHS Forth Valley, Grampian, and also to rural settings, reaching NHS Highland, NHS Shetland and the Western Isles *’* \[ **S7**\]. This implementation during the pandemic decreased necessity for patient travel, lowered pressure on hospital services and reduced crowding in waiting rooms \[ **S7**\]. It enabled diagnosis with greater safety for patient and specialist, by eliminating the need for close proximity in an examination \[ **S7**\]. By 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020, the technology had been adopted in 12 emergency eye treatment centres across 4 Health Boards in Scotland, matching a population density of 1 centre per 100,000 population on average. Extrapolating from the survey data available, this avoided in excess of 60% of consultation escalations to secondary care pre\-lockdown, which increased to an excess of 80% during the first lockdown in 2020, setting a precedent for full national implementation \[ **S7**\]. 

 NHS Scotland received a request during the pandemic to share the slit lamp technology with oDocs, a company from New Zealand which promotes accessible and affordable eye care. The technology was made freely available via the oDocs website during the COVID\-19 response \[ **S7**\]. Through this company, the technology was widely available in New Zealand and Australia by end December 2020 \[ **S7**\]. 

 Development of the teleophthalmology system for use in the NHS was facilitated by the Near Me software, developed by an Australian company called Attend Anywhere. This is the video calling platform for NHS Scotland, areas of NHS England and in Australian healthcare. Due to the clear benefits for service provision and patients during the pandemic, Attend Anywhere continues to liaise closely with the NHS to ensure effective implementation and is in ongoing discussion with Giardini and colleagues to further integrate his research into developments of the platform in Australia and the UK \[ **S7**\]. 

 During 2020, the Strathclyde technology also influenced the design of OpenEyes<sup>TM</sup>, the leading electronic patient record platform for eye care in England and Wales, by enabling asynchronous  teleophthalmology decision support. OpenEyes<sup>TM</sup> is an open\-source ophthalmology and optometry patient record platform with global reach, which has now been procured for national rollout to every optometric practice and hospital eye service in NHS Scotland \[ **S7**\]. 

###  Informing national policy and planning for teleophthalmology services 

 The successful implementation of the slit\-lamp microscope adaptations and teleconferencing technology has inspired further  teleophthalmology development at national level. Efficiencies achieved by remote diagnosis are set to persist in the post\-COVID NHS, and are being replicated across NHS England, as acknowledged in NHS England/NHS Improvement recommendations \(May 2020\) which include video slit lamps, mobile phones and tablets as screen\-share systems so ophthalmologists in secondary care can provide advice and guidance support to optometrists \[ **S8**\]. Increased efficiency of screening and a reduction in unnecessary travel by doctors and patients will help to reduce carbon emissions associated with healthcare, particularly in remote areas. These issues are all addressed in the NHS Long Term Plan \(2019\) which includes a commitment to use technology to reduce outpatient appointments by up to 30 million and reduce unnecessary trips to and from hospital as part of a drive to make over GBP1,000,000,000 in efficiency savings \[ **S9**\]. 

 NHS England and Scotland are actively planning to invest more in remote monitoring and diagnostics; an example is the Small Business Research Initiative \(SBRI\) competition to pioneer remote vision testing, funded by NHS Scotland and Innovate UK. This opened in September 2020 and attracted 25 industrial applicants \[ **S7**\]. The area will open up more commercial opportunities. IDCP, a Dutch company group, opened a subsidiary in Scotland in July 2020 to explore commercialisation of the eye care technologies developed by Giardini’s research team \[ **S10**\] and submitted a tender to participate in the SBRI competition. CEO of IDCP confirms that the choice to open a subsidiary in Scotland was aimed at a close liaison with Strathclyde \[ **S10**\]. 

 Attesting to the significance of Giardini’s research on ophthalmology policy and practice, the National Teleophthalmology Lead for Scottish Government stated that this work is ‘influencing service deployment and influencing policy, with ongoing international outreach. This is important because at service level, with an aging population juxtaposed against dwindling ophthalmology training post numbers, there is an urgent need to decrease pressure on eye care services, reducing the number of emergency referrals that are escalated to secondary care. The teleophthalmology technology addresses this need *.’* \[ **S7**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Direct treatment costs due to dental diseases worldwide are estimated to be USD297,670,000,000. Untreated tooth decay is the most common disease worldwide, with a 35.8% prevalence in western Europe. Following the successful spin\-out of Leeds’ “Filling without Drilling” patent\-protected self\-assembling peptide \(SAP\) technology for treatment of early decay \(pre\-2014\), several new SAP products are now available for treating tooth sensitivity and tooth erosion and maintaining dental health. The Swiss company \(Credentis AG\), formed to market Leeds’ technology within Europe, has won two major awards and is introducing a new product treating periodontal \(“gum”\) disease, the sixth most common of all diseases. In 2017, the rights to the early caries lesion SAP treatment were assigned to a major transnational company, now delivering to a global market, including the US. In Late 2020 Credentis AG was acquired by Swiss dental company vVardis and is now a research and development arm of that parent company.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Self\-assembling peptides \(SAPs\) are synthetic oligomeric moieties of naturally occurring amino acids. Unassembled they exist as non\-Newtonian fluids. By manipulating intramolecular non\-covalent forces, the formation of fibrillar structures dominate, which provide a templated heterogeneous nucleation site for hydroxyapatite. SAP biomimetic regenerative technology for applications in oral healthcare developed out of multi\-disciplinary research at Leeds. This work was led by **Aggeli** \(formerly Royal Society University Research Fellow in the School of Chemistry at Leeds, then Lecturer until 2014\) and **Jennifer Kirkham** \(Professor of Oral Biology, School of Dentistry \(SoD\), University of Leeds until 2019\). **Robert Davies** \(Research Fellow in the School of Chemistry, 2009\-2012, Research Fellow in the SoD, 2012\-2019, now Lecturer in the SoD\) further developed SAPs for new applications and leads the work going forward. 

 Supported by EPSRC and the Wellcome Trust, **Aggeli** described the driving principles governing the spontaneous self\-assembly of β\-sheet forming peptides into fibrillar scaffold structures **\[1\]**. This included the ability to design in responsiveness to specific external triggers in order to control the assembly process. Funded by EPSRC and industry, further characterisation of peptide physico\-chemical characteristics has been taken forward by **Davies** to inform further rational design and elucidate mechanism **\[2\]**. 

 **Kirkham’s** group utilised enamel development as a paradigm for understanding the way in which extracellular matrix proteins control crystal nucleation, deposition and tissue architecture in mammalian biomineralisation. This was based upon the hypothesis that domains of negative charge on extracellular matrix proteins \(themselves self\-assembling\) were responsible for crystal nucleation during enamel biomineralisation **\[3\]**. The work was funded through **Kirkham’s** Wellcome Trust programme \(associated Wellcome Trust, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council \(BBSRC\) project grants, and EPSRC collaborative and Proof of Concept awards from 1998 to date\). 

 **Kirkham** and **Aggeli** used knowledge gained from an understanding of the way in which mineralised tissues form, combined with an understanding of the drivers behind peptide self\-assembly, to address unmet clinical challenges in mineralised tissue repair and regeneration. The Leeds researchers designed peptides that would be unassembled \(monomeric\) at pH values >7.5, providing a low viscosity, injectable fluid that would spontaneously assemble to form a 3D fibrillar scaffold under physiological conditions. In addition, peptides were developed to provide, via their amino acid side chains, domains of negative charge once assembled. The resulting 3D structures therefore mirror biological macromolecules found in extracellular matrices of the mammalian skeleton. 

 Translational, collaborative research between the two groups was funded by an EPSRC CASE \(Cooperative Awards in Science & Technology\) award, a Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust research award and the Leeds Wellcome\-EPSRC Centre of Excellence in Medical Engineering: “WELMEC”\). This research went on to test the hypotheses that rationally designed self\-assembling synthetic peptides could nucleate mineral crystals *in vitro* and *in situ* within artificial decay lesions in human teeth **\[4\]**. 

 Taking this information together, a proof of concept clinical trial \(with Prof PA Brunton, formerly Professor of Restorative Dentistry, Leeds, now PVC, Otago, NZ\) was carried out in Leeds, applying one of the peptides \(P<sub>11</sub>\-4\) to early enamel decay lesions in patients. The results provided unequivocal evidence of efficacy following a single treatment of the lesions with the peptide material, confirmed in case studies in general dental practice. One application reduced lesion size and shifted progression of lesion from ‘arrested/progressing’ to ‘remineralising’ **\[5\]**. 

  

 By comparing a range of related but differenced peptides, the Leeds researchers were able to identify the most important design criteria favouring mineral nucleation and promotion of crystal growth. Work funded by EPSRC\-Credentis AG and carried out by **Kirkham** and **Aggeli** compared the efficacy of these rationally designed peptides in repair of caries lesions and showed that P<sub>11</sub>\-4 remained the best performing candidate. 

 International collaboration between Leeds and University of Campinas Brazil has also demonstrated the viability of P<sub>11</sub>\-4 as a treatment for demineralised dentine and potential application for increasing bond strength in etch and rinse adhesive systems. 

 Work funded by Geistlich Biomaterials \(Switzerland\) and carried out in **Kirkham’s** labs in collaboration with **Dr Julie Burke** \(Lecturer in Oral Surgery at Leeds, now Associate Professor in Oral Surgery in Edinburgh\) and **Dr Xuebin Yang** \(Associate Professor in Oral Biology at Leeds\) demonstrated the ability of P<sub>11</sub>\-4 to promote bone regeneration and repair in a critical defect model *in vivo*. The group also carried out *in silico* modelling of the mode of action of P<sub>11</sub>\-4 \(with **Dr Sarah Harris**, School of Physics at Leeds\) that illustrated the molecular action of P<sub>11</sub>\-4 in nucleating mineral crystals in its assembled \(but not monomeric\) state **\[6\]**. These data led to proof of concept work to determine the effect of application of P<sub>11</sub>\-4 on periodontal repair \(regenerating the tooth supporting tissues including the bone of jaw and the periodontal ligament\). The data showed unequivocally that P<sub>11</sub>\-4 promotes periodontal healing and repair **\[7\]**. 

 In 2018, a grant was awarded by the University of Leeds’ Medical Technologies Innovation and Knowledge Centre \(funded by EPSRC and BBSRC\) to **Davies**, Deirdre Devine and **Kirkham**, School of Dentistry, Leeds to provide proof of concept data demonstrating that SAPs can be used as drug delivery vehicles for the control of periodontal pathogens \(ongoing study\). 

 The research programme illustrates how a multi\-disciplinary team of clinicians, chemists and life scientists were able to draw upon the physico\-chemical principles of peptide assembly behaviour and mineral nucleation ability to design biomimetic materials to recapitulate skeletal tissue development and so effect regeneration and repair across a range of oral healthcare challenges.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Context:** Untreated tooth decay in adults is the most common disease across the globe with an estimated 3 billion people affected **\[A\]**, yet the principles of treatment for dental decay have remained unchanged and inherently sub\-optimal for almost 100 years. The earliest sign of tooth decay is the “white spot” lesion, visible to the clinician on the tooth surface. There is no consensus view as to how this should be treated. Clinicians have three choices: 1\) monitor the lesion to determine whether or not it is getting bigger, then excavate and fill; 2\) apply fluoride treatments, then proceed as in \(1\) or 3\) place a small restoration. Ultimately all restorations will fail and need to be replaced by larger fillings **\[B\]**. Treatment currently costs the UK GBP2,000,000,000 each year within the NHS alone **\[C\]**, driving oral health inequalities. Drilling is feared by many patients, inhibiting their attendance at the dentist and so precluding opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment of decay as well as diseases such as oral cancer. Furthermore, restorative procedures produce aerosols, which provide a vehicle for droplet\-spread diseases such as SARS and Covid\-19. 

 Periodontal disease is the sixth most common disease worldwide **\[A\]** and the most common cause of tooth loss in the ageing population. Taken together, the cost of oral healthcare in Western Europe is USD101,970,000,000 **\[E\]**. 

 Leeds’ SAP technology provides a simple, aerosol free, cost effective alternative to current treatments \(costing less than a third of the most simple conventional filling **\[D\]**\), allowing the clinician to heal, rather than repair, dental decay. 

 **At REF2014**: Leeds’ SAP patented technology had been licensed to a Swiss spin out company that the University of Leeds holds equity in, called Credentis AG. Following first\-in\-man clinical trials at Leeds, Credentis obtained a CE label to market the technology, trademarked as “Curolox”, as a Class II medical device throughout Europe and Switzerland. The first product in the range, “Curodont Repair” was in early clinical use treating patients in continental Europe and Switzerland as a professionally applied product. A second product, Curodont Protect, had just been launched and a third, Curodont D’Senz had been formulated. 

 **Since REF2014:** 

 **New products/ new clinical interventions have significantly increased the reach of this technology, resulting in:** 

1.  Over\-the\-counter \(OTC\) products with SAP P<sub>11</sub>\-4 being made widely available: 

 i\) a new treatment for tooth sensitivity \(“Curodont D’Senz”\), produced by Credentis AG. Now in use in the EU and Switzerland **\[F\]**. 

 ii\) a classic toothpaste \(“Candida Protect Professional”,  produced by Mibelle AG \(subsidiary of Migros\) upon a licence to Credentis Mainly available in Switzerland **\[F\]**. 

 iii\) a specialised toothpaste \(“Emofluor Twin Care” from Dr Wild & Co\), produced by Dr Wild & Co upon a license from Credentis. Available in the EU and Switzerland **\[F\]**. 

 iv\) intensive protection gel against caries and erosion \(“Curodont Protect”\), produced by Credentis AG, Now available in the EU and Switzerland **\[F\]**. 

 v\) a consumer product portfolio “Curodont for Sensitive Teeth”, produced by Credentis AG has been launched Direct\-to\-Consumer. The portfolio contains novel products such as chewing gums and chewie’s as well as classic formats such as toothpastes **\[F\]**. 

  

 All OTC products include SAP P<sub>11</sub>\-4 at effective levels. Candida Protect Professional with SAP P<sub>11</sub>\-4 \(Curolox\) is the top of the line toothpaste of the Candida portfolio. Produced by Migros, the Swiss market leader for toothpaste following a new licence deal, the toothpaste sells around 250,000 units per year. Migros has a large market share in Switzerland and is one of the leading toothpaste brands in the country. 

1.  Curodont Repair Fluoride Plus being launched in the US in 2019, following a distribution deal with Straumann AG for the US market. 

1.  All products containing SAP P<sub>11</sub>\-4 being regulated as oral care products under US Food and Drug Administration Regulation 21 CFR 355 \(the so\-called fluoride monograph\). Formal regulatory approval or clearance is not necessary, but listing within the National Drug Code database is required. 

1.  The non\-exclusive rights to distribute Curadont Repair being given to Straumann AG **\[G\]** in 2017, a large international oral healthcare company and the market leader in dental implants and periodontal regeneration. Straumann is now selling Curadont Repair in key global markets, including the US \[ **I**\]. Additional indications of products with SAP P<sub>11</sub>\-4 are under negotiation. 

 **Impacts on commerce:** 

1.  Credentis AG was awarded the Swiss Excellence award \(for a new product containing P<sub>11</sub>\-4 introduced to the market place\) in 2015, following their receipt of the Swiss technology award in 2013 **\[F,H\]**. 

1.  An entirely new clinical application for the peptide technology has been illustrated by the Leeds researchers in regenerating the periodontium. Credentis AG is now proposing to expand into this new market **\[F\]**. 

1.  Credentis AG was acquired by Swiss dental company vVardis and is now a research and development arm of that parent company **\[F\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 BCU’s Entrepreneurship Education research focuses on customisation to ‘context’. Contexts considered include discipline, space and culture, and setting. Our research has shaped institutional policies, practice and pedagogy. Its beneficiaries include: \(i\) social entrepreneurship educators who adopted a BCU framework across Europe, establishing new communities of practice; \(ii\) entrepreneurs \(particularly women\) and lending\-institutions in the UK, Ghana and Pakistan, who benefitted from enhanced financial literacy; \(iii\) 1260 new start\-up businesses in Africa, whose educators had adopted our approach; \(iv\) long\-term unemployed women tenants, whose national housing association had transformed their approach to employability support to include entrepreneurial self\-employment. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The Business School has longstanding expertise in Entrepreneurship Education \(EE\), with original research highlighting a range of opportunities for contextualised and experiential education **\(R1\).** In particular, our contributions have demonstrated the need to adapt EE to the contexts of ‘subject discipline’, ‘space and culture’ and ‘setting’. 

 Researchers deployed a mixed\-methods approach, involving comparative analysis of academic job adverts \(across disciplines\), educator surveys and entrepreneur interviews, to identify the perception of EE needs in different subject ‘disciplines’. EE must be tailored to industry\-specific, entrepreneurial needs, in order to generate value for beneficiaries **\(R1**, **R2\)**. Our results confirmed the locus of practice in EE, particularly: \(i\) the importance of entrepreneurial role models; \(ii\) the benefits of recent industry\-specific entrepreneurial experiences of educators; and, \(iii\) the benefits of live projects, e.g. working on assessments and scenarios set by real companies, reflecting genuine business problems. This research identified the advantages of adopting existing pedagogies from disciplines other than business, particularly art and design\-based teaching practices, to support experiential learning and assessment **\(R1\).** Through an exploration of the careers of a cohort of creative graduates, **R2** corroborated this. It highlighted a deficiency in explicit entrepreneurship education \(e.g. entrepreneurship modules\) but found that creative discipline pedagogies “led to implicit enterprise education and to the development of entrepreneurial traits” \(e.g. opportunity\-spotting and networking\), due to the experiential nature of creative pedagogies. 

 Further BCU research identified the importance of incorporating motivations and strategies of prospective social entrepreneurs in the co\-design of curricula **\(R3\)**. Carey and Hill led the EE pathway for the Erasmus\+ Business Education for Sustainability project \(see below\). This work demonstrated the need for contextualised EE in the ‘discipline’ of social enterprise. This was particularly so for EE that acknowledged the motivation/orientation of nascent social entrepreneurs and specifically the challenges faced by social enterprises, e.g. when working with volunteers, including issues related to HRM, governance and accounting. 

 Our research has also included analysis of business support intermediaries in the UK, Ghana and Pakistan. We identified the EE needs of entrepreneurs within specific ‘space and cultural’ contexts. For example, **R4** demonstrated the link between financial literacy and access to finance. Using a mixed\-methods approach, researchers found that financial literacy is an interconnecting resource that mitigates information asymmetry and collateral deficit when evaluating loan applications. This was applied to the specific experience of women entrepreneurs, focussing on microfinance in the UK, Ghana and Pakistan. BCU researchers found contradictory impacts for women entrepreneurs accessing microfinance in Ghana. While access to microfinance was empowering, it frequently destabilised family dynamics, with repercussions for loan default. Researchers recommended that the family as a whole should be mentored to take collective ownership and joint decisions in the business, before the credit facility is approved **\(R5\)**. 

 Further research, using a longitudinal and participatory approach, focussed on the context of teaching entrepreneurship outside of formal, institutionalised education ‘settings’. This work was carried out in the UK, in collaboration with ASHRAM Accord, a national housing association. The work centred on developing entrepreneurial capacity amongst long\-term, unemployed, female housing tenants. We found that while entrepreneurial intent was strong \(particularly for lifestyle and micro\-business orientation\), there were practical barriers in terms of self\-efficacy/confidence, issues of intersectionality in terms of the participants experiencing multiple forms of discrimination, and reliance on \(and fear associated with\) the benefits system. These represented blocks to participation. The research developed a roadmap for a “pre\-entrepreneurship education” phase for tenants to be EE ready **\(R6\)**. 

 Regarding the quality of this body of work, **R1** has been cited 83 times, including by notable international scholars within the EE field. Papers **R2, R4,** and **R5** are in journals which are internationally recognised by the Chartered Association of Business School’s Academic Journal Guide \(2018\). Dr Simon Brown \(Head of Enterprise Development at the National Centre for Entrepreneurship in Education, 2011\-2017\) described **R3** as “an indispensable addition to anybody’s library that is involved with enterprise or enterprise education” \(see back cover\). Finally, **R6** was ‘highly commended’ at the Institute for Small Business and Entrepreneurship Conference \(2019\), in both the Gender and Enterprise track, and the conference\-wide ‘Knowledge Transfer’ category.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **a. Enhancing international entrepreneurship education** 

 BCU participated in the AHEAD project, 2017\-2021. Our research changed the pedagogical approach to teaching entrepreneurship and social enterprise in 10 higher education institutions \(HEIs\) in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Based on our research, we co\-created entrepreneurship education teaching materials, which are accessible for all educators, and included: \(i\) case studies of good practice \(available in English and Swahili\); and, \(ii\) an extensive body of teaching materials \(available in English and Swahili\). This work and materials were disseminated at a conference and at a transnational ‘training the educator’ workshop, hosted by BCU, to 40 senior staff from these institutions. A follow\-up survey **\(S01\)** asked participants to: “think about the time since that workshop … \[and\] indicate how your entrepreneurship education provision has developed as a consequence”. Responses were gathered 12 months after the dissemination event, and found that: 

-  96% of workshop participants had adopted Design Thinking or Human\-Centred Design approaches; 

-  75% had adapted provision to suit their local context; 

-  92% said that “opportunities to teach experientially had increased”. 

 In addition, following their lecturers’ participation in the Birmingham workshop, survey participants indicated that this had shaped EE which supported over 1260 new student/graduate business start\-ups **\(S01\)**. Our research helped shape the institutional policy of all of the participating institutions. For example, one respondent stated: 

 “The workshop has been very useful in the review of the curriculum at the institution. Entrepreneurship training is now part of every curriculum in the School of Business, where I am the Dean” **\(S01\).** 

 **b. Materials for social enterprise educators in 8 HEIs across 6 EU countries** 

 As part of the BEST project \(2014\-17\), the School developed a novel set of learning materials that provided a framework for teaching entrepreneurship within the context of social enterprise **\(S02, S03\)**. The project was developed in response to the problems following the economic crisis \(particularly austerity\), with social entrepreneurship and corporate social responsibility emerging as key policy priorities in the EU. It was recognised that  “business and economics education and training does not adequately reflect this trend” **\(S05\)**. The teaching materials developed sought to address this gap. These materials have been translated into six further languages, were available globally via the BEST project Moodle site, and adopted by HEIs in Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania, Spain, Portugal, Turkey and the UK. Universities varied in size from 8000 to 20,000 students, and materials included: 

-  A series of case studies **\(S04\)** which are accessible and used by educators throughout the EU \(available online to anyone\); 

-  The creation of a six\-chapter social enterprise curriculum \(available in seven languages\) focussing on entrepreneurship education within the context of social enterprise, climate change and sustainability. 

 **c. Improving micro\-finance opportunities for entrepreneurs in Ghana and Pakistan** 

 Our work influenced microfinance institutions in a number of countries, leading to lending\-policy change. For example, in Ghana, one SME lending institution changed as follows: 

 “from your findings … we have now made a policy change …especially, mechanisms have been put in place to involve husband and wife in the KYC \[‘know your customer’ is a banking term\] process … It has enabled a better understanding … reducing the number of delinquent loans” **\(S06\)**. 

 This new policy focus on supporting and facilitating shared, household\-ownership of decision making, as a result of BCU research, reduced risks associated with lending to women, while increasing their access to micro\-finance. The research demonstrated the societal benefit of this in decreasing the possibility of family breakdown. 

 Acknowledging a similar need in Pakistan, BCU academics used research to co\-design a programme of ‘train the educator’ workshops to support SMEs. Educators, in this context, are now better equipped to instruct learners and SMEs in how to gain access to finance, ensure sustainability of businesses, and maximise growth opportunities. This activity has so far resulted in the training of 87 SMEs leaders, 47% of whom reported increased turnover, with an estimated 236 jobs created as a result **\(S07\).** 

 **d. Practice and financial literacy in the UK** 

 Our research enabled Aston Reinvestment Trust Business Loans \(ART\) “to reposition our business in the light of the new Government start up loan programme … We have revised and better prepared our literature and website” **\(S08\)**. This has assisted in informing potential applicants as to ‘what information is important’, helping guide entrepreneurs to provide key information then enables ART to more effectively evaluate business proposals. Its Chief Executive stated: 

 “research carried out by academics at BCU, with ART, has informed policy and practice, specifically in relation to better preparing potential entrepreneurs at start\-up and expansion stages” **\(S08\).** 

 **e. Providing a framework for social mobility through entrepreneurship education** 

 Working in collaboration with a UK national Housing association, our research led to a new \(more nuanced\) understanding and approach to supporting women who are long\-term unemployed tenants, when developing their entrepreneurship training needs. In addition, it led to a greater awareness of the role of the housing association within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, supporting entrepreneurship in some of the most deprived wards of Birmingham: 

 “This better understanding helped inform our wider recognition of local enterprise needs and challenges facing our communities. As a result we have developed a more sensitive and tailored approach to community grant management and procurement within the New Initiatives Team, this has been particularly evident in relation to our delivery of the Hall Green Neighbourhood Network Scheme and Hall Green Families and Early Help” **\(S09\).** 

 **f. Inclusion of our best practice in leading EU guide for Entrepreneurship** 

 BCU’s work is used as an exemplar in the leading EU Framework for EE. EntreComp was established to address the European Commission’s policy objective to create a ‘sense of initiative and entrepreneurship’ as one of the key competencies for lifelong learning. Specifically, the BCU EntreComp case study used the experiential learning approach developed through BCU’s research and applied teaching guidance **\(S10\).** EntreComp has been widely adopted, globally, by entrepreneurship educators. In the UK, EntreComp is recommended by leading policy makers and HEI EE support networks, including Entrepreneurship Educators UK, and the National Centre for Entrepreneurship Education.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Poor air quality has profound negative impact on human health. UofG has developed a statistical emulator for the urban air quality model \(ADMS\), enabling the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to quantify the compliance failure risk to air quality regulations under different scenarios. UofG’s emulator and statistical modelling informed the design and development of both the Scottish Government’s National Modelling Framework and the evaluation of low emission zones \(LEZ\) in Scottish cities, the first of which came into effect in Glasgow in December 2018. UofG statistical modelling enabled accurate quantification of the health impacts of the different air pollutants in Scotland and provided key insights in terms of modelling and understanding of how implementation of the LEZs would impact public health. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Statistical research in the monitoring of air and water quality has been a long\-standing focus of UofG. Colleagues in the Scottish Government \(SG\) and Scottish Environment Protection Agency \(SEPA\) have developed strong working relationships with the UofG Environmental Statistics group whose research focuses on the statistical modelling of air and water data. Underpinning UofG research first focussed on the development of air quality indicators \(and associated uncertainty\) \[3.1\] using high\-quality routine monitoring data. In 2015, SEPA contacted Scott to develop statistical methods to examine and model the output from the proprietary ADMS\-Urban air quality model being used in Aberdeen \[3.2\]\). This work focussed on statistically assessing the validity, accuracy and precision of ADMS\-Urban. SEPA have subsequently gone on to use ADMS\-Urban in other Scottish cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh. This is a complex, proprietary mathematical model, involving traffic flow and topology of the city, being driven by vehicle data and meteorological conditions. The complexity of this model precludes its use in routine decision\-making and SEPA approached UofG to develop a more computationally efficient statistical approach to support decision\-making. 

 The UofG statistical research then developed an emulator \[3.3\] that is a statistical model, which simulates the complex model structure of ADMS\-Urban. While ADMS\-Urban delivers detailed maps of the air quality across the city, using traffic and meteorological inputs to drive the concentrations across a fine grid, like many complex physico\-chemical models, this can be very computationally intensive, hence the need for a statistical emulator that is accurate and computationally fast. Working with an honorary research fellow \(Finazzi\) and the SEPA team, Scott developed a statistical emulator, whose code was then ported to SEPA to enable direct use of the emulator output. This emulator permits SEPA to explore the impact of a variety of scenarios including intervention measures such as changes in vehicle classes and volume of traffic on air quality, and thus to directly feed into management measures. The emulator is also being used to evaluate the risk that locations in a given city would be above the nitrogen dioxide annual average limit. The UofG research has shown that this risk is driven by uncertainty in meteorological conditions and emissions \[3.3\]. 

 In 2018–2019 Anderson further developed for SG and SEPA, based on the work in \[3.5\], an annual average high spatial resolution Scotland\-wide air quality index \[follow\-on work specified in 5.1, page 8\], which allows areas with high overall pollution concentrations to be identified. This has produced maps and datasets of Scotland\-wide pollution estimates for a range of pollutants \(including NO<sub>2</sub>, NOx, PM10 and PM2.5\) at a variety of resolutions including Scotland as a whole, local authorities and census data zones. The UofG\-authored report \[3.4\] produced for the Scottish Government contains maps \(and associated datasets\) that display the probability that the level of a particular pollutant is above a given threshold, based on a particular set of environmental conditions. UofG research also produced easy\-to\-use software enabling users to update maps and estimates as new pollution and/or meteorological data becomes available \[G4: 3.4\]. 

 UofG research led naturally to the investigation of associated health effects in the Scottish population focusing on the use of novel statistical models to determine the impact of air quality on cardiovascular and respiratory disease, the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Scotland \[G2, G3, 5.7\]. This research has revealed a relationship between fine particulate matter \(PM10\) and cardiovascular ill health and that particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide concentrations both exhibit substantial and independent effects on respiratory health \[3.5\]. Further research led to the quantification of the potential impact of reducing air pollution in city centres where Low Emission Zones \(LEZ\) are implemented \[G1; 3.6, 3.7\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Background** 

 In 2010, the UK’s Environmental Audit Committee determined that poor air quality results in up to 50,000 additional premature deaths/annum. In 2018, the UK government wrote “Poor air quality is the largest environmental risk to public health in the UK, as long\-term exposure to air pollution can cause chronic conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as lung cancer, leading to reduced life expectancy” \(UK Govt, 2018\). 

 The UK and Scotland routinely fail regulatory air quality standards in specific cities. In 2015, the Scottish Government published the Cleaner Air for Scotland Strategy \(CAFS\) \[5.1\], which aspired for Scotland to have “the best air quality in Europe”. UofG research has supported SEPA in developing modelling tools to assess the likely effect on air quality of introduction of Low Emission Zones \(LEZ\) and changes to traffic emissions \[5.1, p8\]. Research on the health impacts of establishing the first LEZs in Scotland, specifically targeting pollution emissions linked to road traffic and local air quality management plans, is a key objective \[5.1, p25\]. 

 **Route to introduction of Emulator into the National Modelling Framework** 

 The CAFS \[5.1, pp16\-22\] set out the National Modelling Framework \(NMF\) to provide the quantitative evidence to support decisions affecting the planning, design and management of Scotland’s public spaces and transport network. The Scottish Government, Transport Scotland and SEPA have been working collaboratively to develop the NMF with a range of partners including UofG \(Scott, Lee and Anderson\), learning from the success of early pilot work using ADMS and the UofG emulator in Aberdeen. 

 SEPA staff described the initial statistical analysis \(M.Sc. project by Sim\) of the ADMS\-Urban baseline model in the Aberdeen Pilot report in 2017. *“A detailed statistical analysis of the Base Run was carried out as part of a Glasgow University M.Sc. project \(Sim\), It was found that using Functional PCA, Clustering Regression and Deming Regression that the ADMS model does not perform well at Wellington Road, but does perform well at other monitoring locations...”* \[5.2, p100\]. 

 **Providing the evidence base to improve Scotland’s Air Quality** 

 Following the Aberdeen pilot, the Scottish Government’s NMF launched in 2015. UofG research is incorporated into both the NMF and decision support system implemented within SEPA in three ways: 

1.  The emulator code allows SEPA to estimate the risk \(probability\) of compliance failure \(i.e., of exceeding EU directive levels\) under different emissions scenarios, specifically the key effects of meteorological conditions on exceedances. This is essential in developing emission reduction strategies for use at city level and has shown circumstances, under which emission control will not deliver the expected improvement in air quality due to prevailing meteorological conditions \[5.3\]. 

 “*SEPA has been working with Professor Marian Scott \(University of Glasgow\) and Dr Francesco Finazzi \(University of Bergamo\) on a method to help address model uncertainty. Their method, \[3.3\], uses a statistical technique to describe the behaviour of the air quality model. This allows model results to be estimated for many more sets of input data than it is usually feasible to run. SEPA have implemented this method to establish the risks posed to air quality predictions from uncertainty in future emissions and wind speeds. …the technique will be applied to future detailed LEZ modelling. In this way we will be able to estimate the risk to the success of any measures to improve air quality*” \[5.4, p20\]. 

1.  Design of the LEZ’s in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen, the NMF requires that the correct evidence \(data and modelling\) is available to support decision making \[5.5, Section 2\]. Detailed models supported by the UofG emulator for each city provided evidence for taking direct actions at the city scale to reduce street\-level emissions. The Glasgow LEZ was launched in Dec 2018, with a 5\-year phased implementation of restrictions. 

1.  Visualisations developed in \[3.1,3.2,3.3\] are now in routine use within SEPA for Glasgow \[5.6\] and Aberdeen for evaluation of air quality monitoring. 

 This UofG emulator and the risk modelling permits SEPA to explore the impact of a variety of measures such as changes in vehicle classes and traffic on air quality, and thus to directly feed into management measures. “ *The emulator has been invaluable in characterising the behaviour of the ADMS model under a wide range of standard input values \(emissions and wind speed and direction\)*” \[5.6\]. 

 **Impacts on health** 

 Ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease \(including stroke\) and chronic lower respiratory diseases are leading causes of death and ill health in Scotland and are clinical and public health priorities for NHS Scotland and Scottish Government. UofG research has shown that improvements in air quality result in significant population health benefits. Lee’s expertise in quantifying the epidemiological evidence as to the impacts of air pollution on public health has informed policy and LEZ design. Prof. Lee’s research \[3.7\] has provided evidence of impacts but also highlighted that “Differences in the types of study carried out in Scotland make cross comparison of their findings difficult” requiring improved statistical design of studies. \[5.7 p6, 5.8\] proposing further developments. “ *Professor Lee has been a key researcher on air pollution and health in Scotland in particular and has contributed significantly to improving our understanding in Scotland of the nature of the impacts and how intervention measures may lead to future improvements in preventable morbidity and mortality.”* \[5.8\] In recognition of this work, Prof. Lee was invited to become a member of the UK Government’s Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants in April 2020.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University students are vulnerable to a range of security and welfare risks. However, measures taken to mitigate such risks vary widely between institutions and the higher education \(HE\) sector's approach to student wellbeing is fragmented. Research at Salford to understand, model and reframe UK university practice led to the design and development of a novel, student\-centred approach: ProtectED. This is the first Code of Practice and accreditation scheme to comprehensively address student safety, security and wellbeing. Spun out of the University as a not\-for\-profit Community Interest Company \(CIC\) in 2018, ProtectED currently enables six founder member universities to implement good practice and apply an integrated approach to safeguarding the wellbeing of approximately 165,000 students. This includes tackling sexual misconduct, reducing crime and better supporting mental health. ProtectED's award\-winning transformational, evidence\-based approach to addressing student security is recognised by the professional security sector and has impacted the thinking and work of the government regulator of the UK security industry, commercial security companies, university security professionals, and British Council HE representatives among others. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2000, Davey and Wootton’s human\-centred design research has supported practitioners and policymakers \(urban designers, planners, local authorities, police and service providers\) to gain insight into complex challenges, ‘re\-frame’ problems and develop solutions for improving crime prevention, urban safety and wellbeing **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. 

 The human\-centred approach is ‘bottom\-up’, aiming to understand the roles, requirements, abilities and limitations of the humans within a design system, be that a place, a service or a product. Insight from this process leads to improved conceptualisation of problems and in turn to the design of innovative solutions that are nevertheless feasible **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. Davey and Wootton’s design approach is detailed in their book *‘Design Against Crime’* **\[3.1\]**, published in the seminal *Design for Social Responsibility* series. The value of the approach to policy and practice across Europe is detailed in the refereed conference proceedings of the *European Academy of Design* **\[3.2\]**. 

 In 2015, Wootton and Davey initiated a collaboration with two security professionals on the improvement of security practice in higher education \(HE\). Drawing on industry networks, a panel of individuals drawn from key stakeholder organisations was established to advise, assist and inform the research and design process **\[3.3\]**. 

 Research was conducted by Marselle, Wootton and Davey across England and Wales **\[3.4, Introduction & Overview, p. 8\]**. This enabled development of a comprehensive conceptual model of the safety, security and wellbeing issues facing higher education institutions \(HEIs\), students and their parents. Findings were invited to be published by the Deutscher Präventionstag \(DPT\) — the largest crime prevention conference in Europe **\[3.3\]**. Analysis of the research revealed students are at higher risk of crime victimisation than the general population, due to a range of factors, including age, type of accommodation and life\-style. A national survey conducted in partnership with the National Union of Students \(NUS\) \(n=876\) revealed a range of mental health issues facing the 18 to 24\-year\-old age group **\[3.3\]**. Focus group research with security staff, police officers and student services staff across England and Wales revealed the fragmented and unregulated nature of service provision, with standards of safety, security and welfare services varying significantly between institutions **\[3.3\]**. The difficulty in differentiating between universities implementing good practice and those delivering poor service was evident. 

 The ProtectED membership and accreditation concept was designed to support communication of an institution's commitment to student safety, security and wellbeing, as well as improve implementation of minimum standards across the sector **\[3.3, 3.4 Introduction & Overview, p. 8\]**. Findings from qualitative focus group research challenged traditional conceptions of university security as 'manned guarding' and 'key holding', and highlighted a broader safeguarding role requiring 'softer', more interpersonal skills. University security staff are often the first to respond to student mental health issues as they usually work 24/7, including late evenings and weekends when crises are likely to occur **\[3.3, 3.4 Introduction & Overview, p. 8\]**. Indeed, security staff identified ‘student welfare’ as the second most common issue they faced and discussed providing pastoral care to students. Analysis of research findings enabled the conceptualisation and design of a holistic approach for universities to more effectively address student safety, security and wellbeing. The ProtectED concept and structure were tested through prototyping workshops with industry stakeholders \(the ProtectED Advisory Board\) and content developed and validated with subject area experts **\[3.5\]**. 

 The ProtectED Code of Practice **\[3.4\]** covers a number of issues, from core institutional security, through student wellbeing and mental health, to student harassment and sexual assault **\[3.5\]** and the student night out. Safety and wellbeing issues are considered in relation to the entire student experience, both on\- and off\-campus **\[3.4 Introduction & Overview, p. 15, 3.5\]**. Central to ProtectED is partnership working, both internally within the institution and externally with relevant agencies and partner organisations **\[3.4 Introduction & Overview, p. 14\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 ProtectED development research began in January 2015 and identified that the provision of security and student support services in UK universities is fragmented in terms of both service quality and scope. ProtectED was subsequently spun out of the University of Salford as a not\-for\-profit *Community Interest Company* \(CIC\) in October 2018 and is the **first university membership\-based HE sector accreditation scheme** to comprehensively address student safety, security and wellbeing across the whole university experience **\[see 3.4\]**. 

 Sustained by membership fees, six universities had joined as ProtectED  [Founder Member institutions](https://www.protect-ed.org/our-founder-member-universities) as of December 2020: <ins>Br</ins><ins>unel University London</ins>; <ins>Coventry University</ins>; <ins>Teesside University</ins>; <ins>University College London</ins> <ins>\(UCL\)</ins>; <ins>University of Central Lancashire</ins>; and <ins>University of Salford</ins>. ProtectED Patron, Baroness Ruth Henig, has hosted three high\-profile  [House of Lords](https://www.professionalsecurity.co.uk/news/education/protected-latest/) events to welcome ProtectED Founder Member universities and to further promote the holistic accreditation scheme. UCL, the first Russell Group university to join ProtectED, confirmed why it was supporting the scheme: *‘The safety, security and wellbeing of students is of paramount importance to us at UCL. We are proud to be a Founder Member of ProtectED, demonstrating our commitment to achieving our security objective to provide a safe and secure working environment for all students, staff and visitors’* **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.1. Influencing policies and practices across the HE sector** 

 The **holistic approach** adopted by ProtectED is recognised as a **key innovation** of its Code of Practice **\[3.4, 5.2\]**. The Code details three 'Achievement Levels' for each of 187 Indicators: Required Level; \+2; and \+3. Universities must meet the minimum 'Required Level' across all indicators to achieve the *ProtectED Accredited Institution* award. Benchmarking against the Code has enabled member institutions to identify areas for improvement and resulted in the **updating and improvement of policies and practices relating to student safety, security and wellbeing** **\[5.3\]**. This has included university\-level policies in relation to emergency planning and business continuity **\[5.3, 5.4\]**. 

 Work to implement the Code has **reinforced and supported partnership working** with external stakeholders **\[5.3\]** and has also **improved cross\-departmental working** within institutions **\[5.5\]**. Founder Member Brunel University stated that the requirements of the Code ‘led to some key relationship building between the appropriate people and departments across the University’ **\[5.5\]**. Teesside University also supported this approach: ‘We can use ProtectED as a tool to show that the University is a safe place to study. It really appeals that we can develop a holistic approach under one framework’ **\[5.5\]**. 

 The <ins>British Council</ins> now uses the *ProtectED* Code to **inform training in the HE sector**, in this case structuring it around the **international 'student journey'**. Using the ProtectED Code of Practice as a guide, the British Council highlights important issues which affect international students: from selecting an UK institution, through to student experiences whilst studying at their chosen institution including pre\-arrival to the UK, arrival, international student orientation, awareness of fraudulent scams and visa compliance issues affecting study **\[5.6\]**. They advise universities to comply with the Code of Practice and **thereby reduce international students' risk of becoming victim to crime and exploitation** while studying in the UK **\[5.6\]**. As a Founder Member, Brunel University advocates use of the Code to support international students as part of an end\-to\-end process: ‘Our international marketing department loved the idea of ProtectED for how it appeals to international student concerns’ **\[5.5\]**. 

 **4.2. Changing perceptions and practices around security provision** 

 Engagement with ProtectED has enabled sharing of best practice between universities **\[5.3, 5.5\]**, as well as directly impacting **institutions' thinking and practice, particularly during COVID\-19** **\[5.3, 5.4, 5.7\]**. The holistic approach taken by ProtectED has **positively changed perceptions** around the role of university security. Based on ProtectED, institutions have **modernised their approach to university security services**, implementing mental health training for security staff, thereby enabling them to **better help students and staff in distress** **\[5.3\]**. Prior to ProtectED, security staff were not routinely trained in how to deal with such issues. As a result of the Code, the <ins>Association of University Chief Security Officers \(AUCSO\)</ins> has introduced **free Mental Health First Aid \(MHFA\) training** for its members throughout the UK, Ireland and Australia **\[5.4\]**. AUCSO’s Executive Chair confirmed that *‘this* *training has been key to improving the way higher education security officers have supported students during the Covid\-19 crisis’* **\[5.4\]**. The good practice shared around this issue of student wellbeing and mental health is also promoted by Brunel University: ‘We found that many of our students have a great deal going on in their lives, beyond the demands of studying for a university degree, and that extra support was needed in certain areas’ **\[5.5\]**. 

 ProtectED emphasises the need for ongoing performance improvement **\[text removed for publication\]**. Indeed, AUCSO maintains that ProtectED has **changed the perceptions of security staff** about their own role, with the role of a security officer in HE now more widely recognised as being about engaging with students and meeting their expectations **\[5.4\]**. The ProtectED approach has also increased consideration of **diversity in security provision**, with women now better represented within AUCSO **\[5.4\]**. ProtectED has therefore contributed to the **professionalisation of the role of security** within HE, with the scheme being recognised by professional bodies as a **reference point for good practice** **\[5.4, 5.7\]**. The Interim Chief Executive of the <ins>Security Industry Authority \(SIA\)</ins>, the UK Government regulator of the private security industry, attests to the value of ProtectED’s contribution to ‘ **improving standards in the higher education sector** where security practice is fragmented’* **\[5.7\]**. 

 **4.3. Raising standards across the wider security sector** 

 The scheme's **contribution to standards improvement has been acknowledged internationally**, with ProtectED winning the IFSEC International Security & Fire Excellence Award in 2019 for *‘Contribution to standards in the security sector’* **\[5.8\]** and a 2020 OSPA \(Outstanding Security Performance Award\) for *‘Outstanding customer service initiative’* **\[5.8\]**. Its holistic approach to student support was recognised, with ProtectED being a Finalist for the 2020 PIEoneer Student Support Awards **\[5.8\]**. 

 By evidencing the commitment of private and public sector security professionals to improving standards, ProtectED emboldened the SIA in its **recommendations on ways to improve standards in the security industry**. This has supported the SIA in its efforts to promote **better regulation and accreditation \[5.2, 5.7\]**. For example, experience in developing and prototyping the ProtectED Code resulted in the SIA introducing **improvements to its Approved Contractor Scheme \(ACS\)**, thereby reducing the time applicants spend completing forms and resulting in **improved customer satisfaction** **\[5.7\]**. ProtectED has also informed SIA strategy, with two of the SIA focus areas aligning with the Code of Practice: **the night time economy** and **safeguarding the vulnerable** **\[5.7\]**. Drawing on SIA industry expertise, the ProtectED Code of Practice further drives **cost efficiencies for institutional members** **\[5.7\]**. 

 ProtectED has additionally helped **commercial security companies better understand** and meet the needs of the HE context **\[5.2, 5.9\]**. **\[Text removed for publication\]**. Similarly, insight gained from the development of ProtectED is also enabling a <ins>security standards compliance consultancy</ins> to help **clients understand and orientate their services to the specific needs of the HE sector**, supporting it in winning business **\[5.2\]**. 

 The impact of ProtectED on commercial companies and HE institutions alike has been to **improve business processes and practices** and improve the **quality of service experienced** by their customers, university students and staff **\[5.3, 5.7, 5.9\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Centenary of WW1 2014\-19 represented an opportunity for researchers to change and broaden public perceptions of the conflict’s history. Sharp used her research into women’s anti\-war activism in Germany and Britain to counterbalance the battle\-centric and thus male\-centred approach that characterised the planned commemorations. The only researcher working on German resistance to WW1 during the period, she co\-founded a national Peace History Working Group to amplify and internationalise peace narratives and bring marginalised stories to the public’s attention. 

 Her work has: 

-  raised the public profile of the anti\-war narrative during the centenary; 

-  centred women’s anti\-war activism, raising public awareness of the range of positions taken by women; 

-  inspired local history and community groups to explore anti\-war activism; 

-  changed public understanding of and attitudes to German resistance to war; 

-  changed the practice of external partners from the peace activist and engaged arts communities. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Sharp’s research locates and amplifies marginalized and hidden voices, especially those of political women and anti\-war activists. Much of her work on WW1 and its aftermath focuses on rebalancing scholarly narratives to take account of the experience of defeated nations and to make the resistance within these nations visible. She argues that including these voices does not simply add to our historical understanding, it fundamentally changes it. 

 Based on archival research conducted between 2004 and 2019, Sharp is sole or co\-author of a substantial body of academic publications on women’s organised response to WW1 and its aftermath within and beyond Germany. Since 2005, Sharp has attracted RCUK funding to consolidate links between and coordinate the activities of an international network of feminist WW1 scholars, and this is reflected in her co\-edited and co\-authored publications **\[1**\- **4\]**. 

 Her 2007 co\-edited volume **\[1\]** was the first in a series of distinctive comparative works that make Central and Eastern European scholarship accessible to Anglophone readerships through collaboration and co\-authorship. It examines women’s war activism from 1914 to 1919, with the tight time\-frame allowing international commonalities and differences to emerge. A second volume in 2011 **\[2\]** extended the sphere of investigation to women’s hitherto under\-researched transnational activism and organisation in the immediate aftermath of WW1, while a third in 2017 **\[3\]** explored women’s war activism thematically in chapters co\-authored by international teams. 

 Sharp also co\-authored three Special Issues in 2007, 2016 and 2018, of which **\[4\]** reflects on the centenary from an international gender history perspective, finding a common pattern of neglect of women’s wartime experiences in most European nations, countered by members of Sharp’s feminist scholar network intervening in public narratives **\[1\-4\]**. 

 Based on ongoing archival research into the German revolution of 1918, **\[5\]** is one of the first scholarly articles to make women visible as revolutionary political agents and place them at the centre of the narrative. This moves us beyond the stalemate of historical interpretations based on a very narrow view of the revolution in terms of time, space and sphere of action. It places the events of October \- November 1918 within a broader revolutionary cultural context, arguing that without the participation of women in widespread industrial unrest and anti\-war protest from early 1915, the revolution could not have spread. 

 Comparing feminist anti\-war activism during WW1 with the principles and implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 \(2000\), **\[6\]** examines the legacy of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, founded during WW1 and still active as an NGO today. Together with a cultural history of peace \(1815\-1920\) published in March 2020, this work challenges the periodisation that uses war and conflict as the dominant framework for interpreting the past. Focussing instead on developments conducive to fostering sustainable peace such as campaigns for social and gender justice, food security, public health and democracy allows the underlying continuities in these areas to emerge and radically changes our perspective. Sharp’s push to include dissenting and diverse voices in the historical narratives around WW1 is essential to counter persistent claims of national enthusiasm for war in either Britain or Germany. 

 Sharp’s research into marginal voices and scholarship is ongoing, with three further publications forthcoming and a book contract on international revolutionary women with Bloomsbury for submission in 2021.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Sharp noted that dissenting voices and German perspectives, particularly women’s anti\-war activism, were being overlooked in the UK’s WW1 centenary commemorations, and sought to embed them into the public narrative. The main beneficiaries were Sharp’s external partners from the peace history and activist community, the creative and heritage industries as well as theatre, conference and exhibition audiences and MOOC learners. 

 **\(i\) Peace History and Activism:** **amplifying and internationalising anti\-war voices.** 

 Sharp worked closely with leading activists within the peace community, sharing her knowledge of German anti\-war resistance and women’s role within it and inspiring others to make their own contributions to peace history awareness. This work was informed by her study of the historical roots of contemporary peace organisations and the many continuities that help us understand and measure the effectiveness of anti\-war campaigns over time. 

 The reach and resonance of Sharp’s research is reflected in the unusually high number of national and international invitations to contribute to commemorative events beyond the academy, including some high profile international events such as the German Foreign Office \(December 2014\), the Kiel Maritime Museum \(March 2016\), the Kansas National WW1 Museum, America’s official WW1 museum and memorial \(October 2017\), the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom centenary conference in Zurich \(May 2019\), and the Tshisimani Centre for Activist Education, South Africa **\[I\]**. 

 Between 2014 and 2019, Sharp’s public\-facing activities included 53 related talks, interviews, podcasts and lectures locally, nationally and internationally as well as published articles for a wider readership **\[I\]**. The scale and scope of the interventions show that Sharp’s ongoing and sustained efforts to link her historical research to present\-day anti\-war and gender activism resonated strongly with the public. In 2016, she organised two public\-facing international peace history conferences in Leeds in 2016 \(300 delegates from activist and academic communities\), that took a comparative approach across several countries to questions of gender and peace history. 

 In 2014, Sharp co\-founded the national Peace History working group, which brought activists and academics together to coordinate and amplify peace history efforts during the centenary. She worked in particular with the Convenor of the Peace History working group and Peace History Conferences at the Imperial War Museum, who is also a member of the First World War Peace Forum, and a Vice\-President of the international peace society Pax Christi. For this person Sharp’s work ‘brought an otherwise missing dimension’ to their events, and made it ‘impossible to consider planning a WW1 “peace history” event that did not examine the German experience’ **\[A\]**. She felt that Sharp’s inclusive approach ‘made a real difference, helping to bridge the gap between academics and campaigners’ and thus challenging entrenched hierarchies of knowledge. In particular, it stimulated local groups ‘to research the history of opposition to the war in their area, to create exhibitions and local events of their own to mark the centenary – and to make sure the experience of women was included’ **\[A\]**. 

 **\(ii\) **Women of Aktion:** play and exhibition** 

 **Changed Practice** 

 Sharp worked collaboratively over 18 months with partners Bent Architect Theatre Company \(BA\), on the *Women of Aktion* theatre project, focused on the Kiel Uprising **\[E\]**. BA is a socially engaged theatre company with a commitment to bringing lesser known historical stories to the contemporary stage which brings cultural value to Bradford, a culturally diverse city with a high proportion of economically deprived citizens. Sharp’s research and translations of primary sources in German allowed BA to create a historically accurate and ethically justifiable portrayal of the protagonists, which spoke powerfully to the audience’s emotions and sense of justice. BA attest that their experience of working with Sharp caused a shift from highly localised, site\-specific projects to a more ambitious national and international approach. ‘It is the first time we have toured abroad’ and ‘we reached new and wider audiences with untold history’ **\[D\]**. Sharp’s input enabled a more nuanced, layered historical understanding and gave BA access to German\-language materials. ‘It’s really brought us on professionally, I think it’s really changed the way that we will work from now on’ **\[C\]** ‘and opened up a whole new working methodology for us’ **\[D\]**. 

 **Changed Understanding** 

 The play has won critical accolades as a piece of theatre \( **\[H/i\]** ‘What’s on Stage Top Pick’ 30.10.2019\) that was ‘powerful, funny and taught me loads\!’ **\[H/iii\]** and successfully ‘sneaks research into an engaging and entertaining show.’ **\[H/iii\]** It toured in theatres in the UK and Germany, with 17 performances reaching a total audience of 1,000. Audience responses recorded on film **\[C\]** and social media show empathy with the characters’ suffering, admiration for the women and surprise, even anger, that these powerful stories had been suppressed **\[H/iii\]**. This was especially important in the German city of Kiel, where the city’s role in the revolution has historically been forgotten or considered shameful **\[F\]** and the commemoration privileged male accounts while erasing women’s history. One viewer commented: ‘The actors play their roles with such appealing energy that you can’t help sharing their outrage at being left out of the history of the revolution.’ **\[H/iii\]** 

 Sharp also worked with the Chair of the Bradford Peace Museum to produce an exhibition entitled *Women of Aktion* informed by her research insights into women’s contribution to the Kiel Uprising of November 1918. The exhibition has so far been displayed at the Bradford Peace Museum, a pop\-up shop in Bradford city centre, MShed Bristol, Manchester Central Library, Manchester Working Class Library, Leeds City Museum, Glasgow Women’s Library and Richmond Barracks, Dublin, mostly accompanied by public talks. Commenting on the Bradford iteration, the Museum Chair noted that ‘For a largely British audience, used to a male, military, patriotic and establishment analysis of that time, it was revelatory to engage with narrative and critique that were female, civilian, German and revolutionary’ and that Sharp’s input had ‘changed the historical understanding and perception of all who engaged with it’ **\[B\]**. Responses elsewhere have included emotional engagement and identification with the revolutionary women: ‘\[t\]he rallying call of revolutionary German foremothers echoes down the century’ **\[H/iv\]** \(Tweet 30/08/2019\). 

 Further plans to exhibit as part of the Newington Green Revolutionary Ideas since 1708 festival  in April\-May 2020 were interrupted by COVID\-19. The project has an accessible database **\[G\]** that offers a template for academics wanting to work effectively with creative partners, reflections on the project and teaching materials including mini\-lectures, worksheets and summaries for schools and colleges wishing to follow up on topics raised by the project. 

 **\(iii\) MOOC: **Changing Faces of Heroism 

 Sharp led the Leeds bid to work in partnership with the BBC, culminating in the BBC/Futurelearn MOOC ‘Changing Faces of Heroism’/’Heroism through Art and Culture’. This reached a global audience \(39,172 participants from all inhabited continents registered from October 2014 to December 2018\) and attracted highly positive evaluations and 22,550 unique participant comments, 2,344 specifically on Germany **\[J\]**. Sharp’s transnational anti\-war activism research was prominent in the course, challenging dominant attitudes to heroism coded as masculine and nationalist. 

 Participants’ comments and engagement reveal that they thought more comparatively and critically about a wider range of heroic figures, including women, war resisters and German nationals as the course progressed. E.g. ‘Where have I been all this time\! I have been giving the women who took part in the war very little consideration and got swept along with the attention given to the men’ **\[J\]** \(comment ID 2555400\).

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This research into improving toughness of materials to enhance functional performance has driven economic growth and cost\-saving innovations in engineering products worldwide. This study has led to the development of novel materials and technologies, which have since been successfully applied in new commercialized pipe and pipeline products in the Oil & Gas sector, as well as in improvements in building safety and cost\-effectiveness in the Construction industry in Dubai, Singapore and Far East Asia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 A composite material combines materials with different physical and chemical properties to create a new material with improved properties. This research in customising composite materials and improving their toughness focused on multiphase polymer\-based materials and biocomposites consisting of various nanomaterials<sup>P1,</sup>. The study enabled weight reduction and enhanced performance and durability of high\-performance products. It has synthesised novel materials and designed appropriate chemical and physical characteristics by influencing nanofillers alignment, dispersion, chemical bonds and interactions between polymeric chains, securing the desired product functional performance<sup>P2,P3</sup>. 

 This expertise has led to significant improvement in functional performance, impact resistance in thermoplastic and thermoset composite materials as highly desired by automotive organisations such as Nissan \(UK\), GIVE Srl \(Greece\) and Shapoorji Pallonji \(India\). As a result, the team was awarded InnovateUK and UKEIRI Newton Fund grants. 

 This research has also investigated interfacial bonds, delamination and strength of adhesively bonded joints<sup>P4</sup> \(cold\-bonding technology\), and their flammability characteristics. When evaluating the role of adhesive thickness, the intrinsic properties of the materials play an important factor in determining flexibility and load carrying capability of the adhesive joint, as well as the stress state induced in the adhesive in multi\-material composite product. 

 Novel materials require development of optimised and often specialised manufacturing processes and knowledge in polymer matrices, cure mechanisms and pull force predictions. This research has improved materials synthesis and manufacturing process by demonstrating the physicochemical characteristics of materials, their failure envelop, failure mechanisms and damage evaluation of fibre\-reinforced composites as a function of process, loading fractions and product operational conditions and requirements<sup>P1,P2</sup>. The study has explored thermo\-mechanical behaviour of biocomposite materials<sup>P5</sup> and flammability when using inorganic nanofillers and degradation under various media linked to the O&G industry’s high performance and safety requirements. 

 It has highlighted opportunities for materials improvements and reduction of manufacturing defects while improving condition monitoring techniques of new engineered materials solutions for O&G industry. The research on condition and corrosion monitoring focused on defect detection and location, stress and strain measurement and characterization of vibration. This work demonstrated specialized non\-destructive testing \(NDT\) techniques in often inaccessible and harsh environments, developed new failure models and definitions, condition monitoring of materials, structures, pipelines, and composite products. 

 Further research has focused on demarcation of molecular and structural features that contribute to dynamic mechanical properties such as vibration, shock and impact resistance of multiphase composites \(polymer, fibres and nanoparticles\)<sup>P1,P2,P3</sup>, important in designing hybridised composite materials for applications in shock and impact performance products. For body armour applications, new resin grades on polyamides, polyethylene and polyester fibres reinforced with glass/carbon/basalt fibres hybridised resin composite during high velocity impact were developed. Using experimental and analytical techniques, a methodology was developed for calculating Gurneisen parameter from the measured Hugoniot in shock velocity which is exploited in developing impact functionalised hybridised composites<sup>P6</sup> \(helping design improved ballistic impact protection materials including ballistic proof beams and panels for the construction, military, and automotive sector\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research on resin matrix cure mechanism, pull force predictions and polymer nanocomposites hybridization enabled Shapoorji Pallonji \(US$25.7 billion Indian multinational\) to develop new products using pultrusion process, including composite bulletproof panels, skyscraper I and H composite beams, and construction foundations layering panels now used in construction buildings in Singapore and Dubai, \~15% of Far East Asia construction business<sup>C</sup><sup>1</sup> creating new jobs both in India and Far East Asia. RGU research continues to support these products to diversify and evaluate life cycle prediction \(cyclic loads and surface behaviour\). Shapoorji Pallonji have also employed a material grade developed into a new generation of ballistic proof vest \(Indian Patent App. No 201821031691\) as military/security protection gear and vehicle armor in passive safety vehicle body structures. 

 Engineered Composites Solutions Ltd \(ECS\) also benefited from this study, generating 15% new business in composites repair technology<sup>C2</sup>. The organisation focused on the impact behaviour of composites pipe wraps and their long\-term integrity in offshore Oil & Gas production risers and pipelines, where it is mandatory to extend pipelines lifespan. This method averts costly production shutdown cost \(>US$125,000/hr\), typically 30% cheaper than welded steel sleeve repair and 75% cheaper than replacing defected pipe section while reducing maintenance burden. This provided ECS with an edge over other suppliers bearing 15% new market growth. 

 These novel materials were also applied in servicing pipelines by Subsea 7 \(global Engineering Services Company\) to address the challenges related to connecting and assembling multi\-bore structures and systems in subsea waters, such as pipeline bundles and riser structures used in subsea Oil & Gas industry<sup>C3</sup> \(U.S. Patent No. 10,774,971\). Consequently, RGU input to Subsea 7 on thermo\-mechanical \(combined pressure and temperature\) ageing of insulation materials in subsea pipes successfully demonstrated the applicability of insulation types to the new technique for subsea pipe\-in\-pipe design. This novel insulation method is anticipated to secure projects worth £50m in oilfields with specific fluid temperature problems. 

 RGU research on adhesives bonding technology and expertise in material behaviour under extreme thermo\-mechanical loads was employed by Cactus Industrial Ltd and supported by global manufacturer Chesterton ARC \(Germany\), successfully providing a solution for rehabilitation of overlaying decks and roofs as an alternative to traditional method of plating and welding in pressured habitat<sup>C4</sup>. The treacherous offshore conditions in sealing assembly result in heavy shear loads on axial movement \(up and down\) conditions for adhesively bonded joints used in high temperature and flammable environments, which can have major safety implications. This research demonstrated the capability of composite\-metal system to endure harsh environments and cost\-savings of \~£250,000/unit platform flooring. Cactus Ltd has since achieved significant business growth \(CAGR 10%\) in its Oil & Gas onshore and offshore operations, where the cold process technique is growing and has safeguarded jobs<sup>C4</sup>. 

 Further RGU research was utilised by Oil Technics Ltd \(fire extinguishing foam grade producer\) which was facing concerns about increased capital expenditures from leaking storage vessels worldwide storing over 100,000 litres of fire extinguishing foams<sup>C5</sup>. This problem was especially persistent in hot climate regions in Australia, Middle East and Brazil. The research focused on materials compositions and foam additives in these locations, to devise a solution capitalizing on materials behaviour at given temperature conditions. This resulted in substantial cost\-savings for Oil Technics and storage tanks manufacturer SEMCO MARITIME \(Australia\), while ensuring fire safety for Oil & Gas operators, safeguarding 20% Oil Technics business. This in turn created new jobs in the UK, secured large scale contract from Australia and acted as a gateway to new market for OilTechnics <sup>C5</sup>.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Football has immense sporting, cultural and economic impact with reach around the globe. Research undertaken by the Football Exchange \(FEx\) includes match and training analysis and key aspects of player preparation and recovery. This research has been translated into evidenced\-based practice to produce impact within multiple layers of the global football industry. FEx research has significantly changed player tracking procedures underpinning the global uptake of this technology within elite football. Our research has also changed practice associated with player preparation and recovery in elite clubs, national associations and international governing bodies. The successful translation of FEx research has provided football practitioners from around the world with evidence\-based models for their professional practice that have enhanced player and team development from an economic, health and performance perspective. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The FEx is a leading unit for football related research and applied consultancy activity in the UK, first established through the pioneering research of Professor Tom Reilly in the mid 1970’s.  It has produced >170 peer\-reviewed articles \(4857 citations\) between 2000\-2020 and generated in excess of £1million of external grant and industrial income from a range of important stakeholders \(i.e., National football associations, elite clubs, international governing bodies and technology companies\) across the global industry.  Specific FEx research has led to demonstrable changes in player tracking technology and the way in which football clubs use technology to track and monitor the physical capabilities of their players.  Physical preparation and recovery strategies have also been changed within clubs as a direct consequence of research into energy intake, expenditure and body composition and the development of methods to evaluate training status of elite players. The information below describes the two research themes and the unique insights and outcomes that the studies have generated. 

 The FEx has a long history of providing empirical data that has informed the development of leading player tracking technologies used across the global game. The data generated from **REF 1** established the validity and reliability of Stats Perform’s \(formerly Prozone\) automated match\-analysis tool, which remains the world’s leading computerised match performance analysis system. Crucially, data demonstrated that the system was highly accurate \(within 0.4%\) and reliable \(\~1.5\-6 %\) at quantifying match\-related displacement velocities. **REF 1** also provided the foundation for subsequent research undertaken through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) **.** The KTP focused on the unique application of advance machine learning analytical techniques to create a multi\-variate playing style methodology which provides a more comprehensive understanding of the complex inter\-relationships between variables at the level of the individual player and the team \(player interaction, style of play\) and the extent to which they influence the outcome of games. **REF 2** assessed the validity of the world’s leading wearable global positioning system \(GPS\) technology to evaluate important metrics for examining the physical demands of training in football. We demonstrated the system presented a valid measure of maximal sprint speed versus the criterion measurement tool \(laser gun\), however, the system failed to provide valid measures of important metrics including acceleration and deceleration capacity.  Collectively, this body of work has led to changes in the software provided to elite team sports by the world’s leading player tracking technology companies as described in the detailed resulting impact in Section 4. 

 Research from the FEx has also examined multiple facets of player preparation and recovery. More specifically, potential measurements of player training status during an in\-season competitive phase were examined in elite players \( **REF 3**\). Morning\-measured perceived ratings of fatigue, sleep quality and muscle soreness were more sensitive than heart rate\-derived indices to the daily fluctuations in training load, suggesting that they could be used as non\-invasive assessments of player training status in elite soccer players. This research has been integral to the development and implementation of a novel framework to evaluate player training status which has led to a significant reduction in injury\-related unavailability at a leading Premier League club.  Our research has also informed evidence based nutritional guidelines for adolescent and adult male professional soccer players. Although the physical and physiological demands of soccer match play and training have been reasonably well documented, the energy requirements of elite soccer players throughout the player pathway \(i.e. adolescent through to adulthood\) were not yet characterised.  To this end, we conducted a 5\-year programme of research that quantified body composition, resting energy requirements and total daily energy requirements \(TDEE\) of adolescent and adult male soccer players.  In utilising the gold standard technique of doubly labelled water, we quantified for the first time the TDEE of adult male football players from the English Premier League \( **REF 4**\).  During the common two\-game per week schedule, data demonstrated that professional players expend approximately 3500 kcal/day, equating to a relative TDEE of 45\-55 kcal/kg fat free mass \(FFM\).  In relation to adolescent soccer players, absolute TDEE progressively increased as players transition through the academy pathway \( **REF 5**\) where relative TDEE equates to 60\-80 kcal/kg FFM.  For example, U18 players presented with a TEE \(3500 kcal/day\) that was approximately 600 and 700 kcal/day higher than both the U15 \(3000 kcal/day\) and U12/13 players \(2900 kcal/day\), respectively.  Moreover, it is noteworthy that some individual players \(as evident in all age groups\) presented with a TDEE that was comparable to \(or exceeded\) that previously reported in adult players. We also provided the first report to simultaneously quantify body composition in both adolescent and adult players \(using dual\- energy X\-ray absorptiometry\).  Importantly, these data demonstrate that both adolescent and adult players present with similar absolute levels of fat mass but distinct differences in FFM \( **REF 6**\).  Collectively, this body of work now informs nutrition policy and practice that aims to promote growth, maturation and performance across the player development pathway as described in the detailed resulting impact in Section 4.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The FEx has strategically engaged in a number of dissemination events with external stakeholders to communicate and translate the group’s research to change practice.  This has included a number of industrial advisory and consultancy roles for members of the FEx with clubs in the English Premier League \[i.e., Everton FC \(Close 2016\-2019\), Liverpool FC \(Morton, 2010\-2015; Drust 2006\-2019\), Manchester United FC \(Gregson, 2008\-present\), Aston Villa FC \(Close 2020\-present\)\], national associations \[i.e., The Football Association \(Close, 2017\-present\), Qatar FA \(Gregson, 2012\-present\)\] and governing bodies \[i.e., UEFA \(Morton, 2018\-2020\]. The international reach is further evidenced in a number of keynote addresses and committee roles for staff, and the appointment of the FEx as the strategic partner of Isokinetic Medical Group at their annual international conference \( **Evidence 1**\). In addition, FEx staff have supported development of the global industry’s first digital knowledge exchange platform \( [https://fellows.aspire.qa/index.aspx](https://fellows.aspire.qa/index.aspx)\). Launched in 2014, Aspire in the World enables elite clubs and national associations from over 30 countries to share practice on elite player development \(\~190k hits to date\). The FEx has also been integral in the School’s Professional Doctorate in Applied Sport and Exercise Sciences \(DSPORTEXSci\).  Validated in 2015, the programme has supported the development of a significant number of practitioners \(i.e., 19\) working as researching professionals nationally and internationally in applied football environments \(e.g., English Premier League, Scottish Premier League, Football League, The Football Association, Major League Soccer and the Professional Referees Organisation. Evidence of change, including its significance and reach are outlined below, and the process, beneficiaries and nature of the impact are explained in detail. 

 **1. Development of contemporary player tracking technologies which have revolutionised performance analysis capability across the global football industry** 

1.  Stats Perform computerised performance analysis system 

 Data derived through advanced computerised technology in relation to the performance of players during match\-play is now universally adopted across the global football industry. Our research \( **REF 1**\) was crucial in initially allowing Stats Perform \(formerly Prozone\) to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of its computerised performance analysis system.  Consequently, these data were instrumental in allowing Stats Perform to gain acceptance across the global football industry as the leading provider of automated tracking solutions.  Over the period 2014\-2020, Stats Perform global market share has continued to grow with its client base and revenues increasing by more than 400% \( **Evidence 2**\).  Validation of the system also provided the foundation for our subsequent research undertaken as part of an award\-winning KTP \( **Evidence 3**  [https://educatenorth.co.uk/2016\-winners/](https://educatenorth.co.uk/2016-winners/)\). The KTP, completed in 2015 \(jointly funded by Stats Perform and the ESRC\), led to the development and implementation of the global football industry’s first commercially available software for tactical profiling and playing styles analysis of elite teams \( [https://www.statsperform.com/team\-performance/football\-performance/match\-analysis/](https://www.statsperform.com/team-performance/football-performance/match-analysis/)\) \( **Evidence 2**\). Released in 2019, the software has changed the interpretation of game\-related statistics by coaching and performance staff in elite football clubs. This change in interpretation has proved valuable for practitioners who utilise such data to develop performance plan\(s\) of players, teams and organisations.  This can be demonstrated by the use of these data and processes by the Head of Performance and Research at English Premier League team Wolverhampton Wanders \( **Evidence 4**\). Since its release, the software has attracted a global client base spanning 10 countries \( **Evidence 2**\). 

1.  Catapult Sports wearable global positioning system \(GPS\) technology for evaluating the physical demands of football 

 Wearable global positioning system \(GPS\) technology has revolutionised the ability to evaluate the physical demands of training in football and therefore enhanced the capability of practitioners to optimise performance, mitigate injury risk and facilitate safe return to play following injury. At the elite level, the precision of GPS data is of critical importance.  The detailed information in **REF 2** has directly led to changes in the algorithms which underpin the software utilised by Catapult Sports \( **Evidence 5**\). As the world’s leading provider of wearable GPS tracking technology in sport with a global client base of over 1200 users, our research has therefore directly impacted the quality of data now available to elite sports team on a global level \( **Evidence 5**\). **REF 2** directly influenced the development and implementation of a unique national player tracking programme in Qatar as part of the countries preparations for hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup \( **Evidence 6**\). The research findings underpinned a successful grant application to FIFA \(£1.5 m\) which financed the provision of GPS technology to all elite clubs in Qatar together with QFA youth and senior national teams. Implementation of this technology together with a contemporary data management system and ongoing coach education has significantly changed the capability of Qatar’s coaches to develop training programmes which optimise player development \( **Evidence 6**\). For example, the ability to measure precise running speeds using GPS, as shown by our research \( **REF 2**\), has provided staff with data to help guide, control and optimise the training stimulus, thereby enhancing both the quality of team training and the process of rehabilitation for injured players \( **Evidence 6**\). 

 **2.   Enhancing elite player development and performance** 

1.  Development and implementation of a framework to evaluate player training status which has contributed to a significant reduction in player injury at an elite football club 

 The demands of training and match\-play can induce a high degree of physical stress on elite football players which leads to injury. Prior to our research virtually no evidence was available concerning the validity and utility of practical assessment techniques for evaluating the training status of elite soccer players in the field.  Our research directly resulted in the development and implementation of a series of assessments which formed the basis of an assessment framework to evaluate player training status \( **REF 3**\). The framework was used by the club’s first team coaches, medical and performance staff in their daily practice. This change in practice was significant in contributing to increases in match availability of approximately 14% per season in the first team playing squad through a reduction in injury\-related unavailability over three competitive seasons \(2014\-2015 to 2016\-2017\) \( **Evidence 7**\). In light of the significant financial costs associated with injury related \(team underachievement and player salaries\) decrements in performance, the change in practice driven by our research had a significant positive impact on “return on investment” to the club \( **Evidence 7**\). 

1.  Development of evidence\-based nutrition policy and practice guidelines to influence player development during the pathway from adolescent to adult professional player 

 Our data \( **REF 4\-6**\) now informs both policy and practice of world leading governing bodies and professional soccer teams.  As recognised research\-informed practitioners, members of the Football Exchange were appointed to an Expert Advisory Group to co\-author the 2020 UEFA Expert Group Statement on nutrition in elite football \( **Evidence 8**\).  This work was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine in an Expert statement that has already been downloaded over 18,000 times.  The papers cited in section 2 were referenced accordingly as evidence\-based research papers that inform the daily energy requirements for both adolescent and adult players.   Our research is also directly informing practice within professional football environments in relation to both body composition strategies and the wider nutritional philosophy underpinning the club’s performance nutrition programme.  In relation to the former, our data now informs coaching and sport science practice in that adolescent players should not be aiming to reduce absolute fat mass.  Rather our research supports the rationale for players to engage in well evidence\-based nutritional and training practices that promote the growth of fat free mass \( **Evidence 9**\).   Moreover, English Premier league teams are now using the cited research \(alongside a wider body of nutritional related research from the Football Exchange\) to underpin the evidence based nutritional philosophy of the club’s performance nutrition programme \( **Evidence 10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A unique partnership between Durham University and Procter and Gamble \(P&G\) has enabled multiple industrially relevant research projects across experimental, computational and theoretical physics. These have led to new formulations and manufacturing processes for laundry detergents, the design of new liquid\-repellent surfaces and improved testing of laundry and dishwasher products – exploited in P&G product lines such as “Tide”, “Ariel”, “Cascade” and “Fairy”. The partnership has won numerous awards and attracted inward investment of over GBP20million for the North East region. The estimated value of the improved P&G products and processes exceeds GBP800million per annum, in markets worth GBP11billion. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning the impact spans multiple groups within the Physics Department, including the Centre for Advanced Instrumentation \(Girkin\), the Centre for Materials Physics \(Kusumaatmaja\) and the Institute for Computational Cosmology \(Bower\). It was the breadth and interdisciplinarity of the research in the Physics Department that first attracted P&G to Durham University \( *A Clean Solution*, Physics World, January 2013, by Michael Duncan, then\-Global Director of Open Innovation for P&G, Professor Girkin and then\-Durham Professor McLeish\). 

 The research relationship between Durham Physics and P&G began with a project from P&G to improve grease removal in laundry at lower temperatures, and with smaller amounts of water. 

 This minimises environmental damage as well as energy costs, but the process is difficult to study in detail as grease is optically active, leading to aberration of the images, and hence blurring, so that the effectiveness of different detergent formulations could not be resolved. 

  

 Professor Girkin is a world expert in adaptive optics \(AO\) and their applications to biological materials, such as mammalian brain tissues \[R1\] and zebrafish hearts \[R2\]. The core technique Professor Girkin pioneered for these studies is 3D optical microscopy, combining widefield and beam scanning imaging. Crucially, this can incorporate active elements, where the shapes of the optical surfaces are controlled in real time to compensate for aberration. Professor Girkin was able to develop “the world’s smallest washing machine” under a microscope with adaptive optics \[R3\], enabling visualisation of grease removal with different lipase formulations developed by P&G, at a scale never before seen. The resultant movies identified a new physical process which was important in the washing cycle, where bubbles of CO<sub>2</sub>, released from the fat by the detergent, helped dislodge the grease from the surface. 

 The success of this programme led to further projects between P&G and Durham Physicists, developing similar optical instruments for measuring the cleanliness of dishwashed glasses. 

 A rather different project between P&G and Durham Physics focussed on developing new liquid\-repellent surfaces. This was led by Dr Kusumaatmaja, a soft condensed matter physicist with expertise in wetting phenomena: how liquids interact with solid surfaces. Dr Kusumaatmaja’s team has developed powerful computational approaches to study how equilibrium morphologies \[R4\] and dynamics of liquid droplets \[R5\] can be strongly influenced by surface roughness and structures. Using these in\-silico research methods, Dr Kusumaatmaja has undertaken research with P&G’s Transformative Platform Technology division in Cincinnati, to enable more efficient removal of soils, and to optimise the design parameters of superhydrophobic and liquid\-infused surfaces. 

 Another collaboration was with Professor Bower, a computational cosmologist specialising in numerical simulations of the Universe. These are computationally very expensive and there are too many free parameters to explore the effect of each one. Instead, he developed Gaussian emulator methods in collaboration with statisticians in Mathematical Sciences, in order to reliably predict how the results depended on the control parameters with only sparse sampling of these parameters \[R6\]. This has widespread applications, and for P&G, the issue was how to optimise the spray drying process used to produce their laundry powders from wet slurries. Spray drying is energy intensive, so optimising it is important, both financially and environmentally. Professor Bower was able to use his algorithms to provide real time optimisation of the control parameters from very limited data. P&G are rolling this out as a tool in all of their drying plants.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 As outlined, the research expertise and knowledge of academics in Physics at Durham has been applied in a variety of different focused research interactions that have directly generated substantial wider impact through their effects on P&G products and processes. 

 For background, P&G is a leading global manufacturer of consumer goods with 5 billion customers worldwide. The relationship between Durham and P&G started with research projects in Physics and to date there is a portfolio of 100 projects in Durham Physics, Chemistry, Life Sciences, Computer Sciences and the Business School, leveraging GBP24.5million of funding. The impact of the collaboration is well evidenced by the fact that the relationship has been recognised as “best in class” numerous times \(e.g. the RSC Teamwork in Innovation Award in 2015 \[E3\]\), and mentioned as a best practice example in the UK Wilson business review \[E5\], the US Governor Association conference \[E4\], and an EPSRC case study \[E6\]. Based on this relationship, Professor Girkin ran an Open Innovation workshop with the IOP \[E7\] with 14 companies attending. 

 The research arising from the Durham\-P&G relationship has delivered significant wider economic impact in the region \[E8\], as highlighted by the statement from a senior P&G staff member at Longbenton, that it *“helped to cement the role of the Longbenton Technology Centre within the P&G infrastructure”, “safeguarding over 300 jobs in the Northeast”* \[E1\]. The relationship has also helped build relationships between P&G and the Centre for Process Innovation \(CPI\) catapult, that was instrumental in bringing the National Formulation Centre to the North East \[E10\]. The GBP14million project CEMENT between Durham, P&G, CPI and Peerless specifically created 50 highly skilled jobs in the North East. It was essential for the creation of the University’s Centre for Innovation and Growth, awarded GBP10million from the North East LEP \(Local Enterprise Partnership\) \[E9\]. 

 With respect to the specific research examples, the following sections detail the wider impact arising from the application of novel microscopy to improving grease removal, the application of computational methods to increase cleansing efficiency and optimising superhydrophobicity, and the application of artificial intelligence methods for optimising production processes. 

####  <ins>3D Optical Microscopy Research into Grease Removal</ins> 

 In product development, Professor Girkin’s research developing the “World’s Smallest Washing Machine” has beneficially impacted P&G in two different and significant ways. First, the 3D optical microscopy \[R1\-3\] has impacted on P&G business by allowing them to test new formulations of lipase\-based laundry products \(e.g. for Tide and Ariel\) for grease removal using significantly lower levels of the functional compound. Annually P&G spends USD10million on the development of new washing formulations and it was estimated that the work in Durham saved USD2million in internal costs. Second, a major target in laundry is for reduced energy consumption, both in the production of products \(see later\), and in the washing cycle. The imaging approach provides a novel route by which P&G has improved cold water washing, uniquely enabled by the Durham research. The discovery of the CO<sub>2</sub> release enabled P&G to modify their flagship laundry products \(e.g. Tide\) to stimulate this release, helping to “ *blow the fat*” from the surface. “ *The direct financial benefit of this improvement is very hard to quantify... In 2018 the laundry market value was around \[USD\]15bn, and we achieved a \[USD\]1.1bn increase in sales, and some of this is attributable to the improved formulation*” \[E1\]. Furthermore, variations of this optical method have been applied at a macroscopic level at the P&G Longbenton facility, to measure the cleanliness of glasses for the development of dishwashing products \(e.g. Cascade, Fairy\). P&G estimate they “ *spend \[USD\] 500K/yr on such work*” \[E1\] and the instruments and associated methodology developed in Durham were aimed at “ *significantly reducing this cost overhead”* \[E1\]. 

####  <ins>Computational Studies of Cleaning on Structured Surfaces</ins> 

 Understanding how liquids and semi\-solids can be efficiently removed from solid surfaces is critical across many P&G product categories, from shampoos and detergents to paper towels. The computational work \[R4, R5\] of Dr Kusumaatmaja had impact for P&G with their product R&D in two different aspects: firstly, to identify suitable design parameters for so\-called superhydrophobic and liquid infused surfaces, prized for their superior liquid repellency; and secondly, to remove soil efficiently under constrained resources \(water and surfactants\) under different conditions \(e.g. soil viscosity, mechanical perturbations\). Experimental trial\-and\-error would *“require years of laboratory work … and will cost P&G multiple full\-time staff members”*. Instead, the simulation results have reduced “ *experimental time and resources by more than a half”* \[E2\]. 

####  <ins>AI Techniques for Optimising Spray Drying</ins> 

 Spray drying is an important energy\-intensive step in laundry powder production, manufactured at the rate of 30 tonnes/hour in the UK, with current energy costs for the drying process estimated to be  over GBP5million per annum \[E1\]. With commercial and environmental needs to reduce the energy use, the AI techniques developed by Professor Bower to model astronomical events were adapted to optimise the operation of P&G’s blow\-drying towers with real\-time feedback. Based on the work already undertaken by Professor Bower \[R6\] and P&G Longbenton engineers, *“initial estimates and the work already undertaken a saving of 5% will be made. Not only will this save money for P&G it will also be a benefit in using less energy and hence reduce our* \[P&G’s\] *carbon footprint”*. \[E1\] 

 In summary, the collaboration between Durham Physics and P&G has had strong impacts at multiple levels, from improvements in P&G laundry products \(with global market share of 45%\) through to inward investment and job retention in the North East.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study describes the impact from architectural research investigating historical settlement in the Sultanate of Oman \(Arabian Peninsula\). It advances the application of heritage theory and policy in Oman to arrest the on\-going loss of vernacular settlements. Successful collaborations with government bodies and local communities have pioneered implementation of heritage policies at 3 historic sites, saving these from dilapidation, and supporting heritage\-focused community cooperative development. The work has assisted ministries, museums, a financial institution, businesses and private citizens to realise sustainable heritage management goals, change heritage design practice and empower communities by raising awareness of the social and economic value of heritage sites. It has also built capacity in the cultural heritage sector amongst government employees, tourism operators and conservation professionals \(Oman, Middle East, Morocco, UK\). 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Research at this HEI was initially undertaken by Bandyopadhyay in 2000\-2008 at the University of Liverpool \(UoL\), and continued from 2015, again at UoL, by Bandyopadhyay and Quattrone for the ArCHIAM research centre \(Architecture and Cultural Heritage of India, Arabia and the Maghreb,  [www.archiam.co.uk](http://www.archiam.co.uk/)\). 

 Bandyopadhyay pioneered the systematic study of vernacular settlements and architectural heritage of Oman and the Gulf, which has underpinned subsequent impact work. This began in 2001\-2002 with a major exhibition disseminating research on Harat al\-Bilad settlement in Manah oasis \(approximately 100 panels; catalogue\) held in Oman and UAE, reexhibited in 2005\-2006. This detailed study developed and tested new methodological approaches to settlement documentation and analysis, identified the unique characteristics of central Omani religious, civic and domestic building types, and demonstrated the close relationship between tribal dynamics, social history and settlement morphology **\[3.1\]**. The Omani mosque type was further explored in 2003 within a wider peninsular Arabian geographical and temporal context to demonstrate its pre\-Islamic ‘South Arabian’ origin **\[3.2\]**. A study of the impact of tribal dynamics on settlement organisation and evolution \(2004\) demonstrated how large oasis settlements developed a more ‘cosmopolitan’ character that transcended tribal divisions present in smaller, isolated settlements. This research also examined the spatial implications of social exclusion and tribe\-specific craft traditions **\[3.3\]**. Analysis of settlement structure and evolution conducted in 2005 highlighted how topography, management of arable land and water, and social structure, shaped settlements in central Oman, resulting in differing settlement types and morphological processes **\[3.4\]**. ArCHIAM’s impact work has drawn on this understanding of complex settlement formation and inhabitation dynamics, achieved through a holistic methodology that combined documentation, and historical and ethnographic work, to devise culturally appropriate and sustainable management and development strategies. 

 From 2002 Bandyopadhyay’s research informed two significant heritage management reports for the Government of Oman and UNESCO, co\-authored by Bandyopadhyay in collaboration with international consultants \(Atkins; CES\). The work on Bahla World Heritage Site \(2002\-2005\) and Nizwa \(2004\-2005\) studied the urban morphology of large inland oasis sites and the role of water infrastructure. The Nizwa report also suggested an ‘adaptive reuse’ approach – arguing for a shift away from a conservation\-centred approach – based on sympathetic contemporary design introductions, to better align heritage assets with developmental aspirations. 

 In 2015 the ministries of Heritage and Culture, and Tourism commissioned ArCHIAM to develop three documentation and research reports employing a consistent methodology. Here, Bandyopadhyay and Quattrone’s research shed light on the nature of single\-tribe settlements and the impact of Indian Ocean trade on ports and inland oasis settlements **\[3.5\]**. The Gulf Architecture Project \(GAP, 2019\-2020\), funded by the Qatar National Library \(GBP737,000\), has helped expand this understanding across the Arabian/Persian Gulf region. Comparisons across the Gulf region have identified new building types and thrown light on variations of the religious and domestic typologies **\[3.6\]**. The research has continued to highlight the need to frame the questions surrounding preservation and tourism in the Middle East within a wider sustainable development discourse.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The main strand of impact is on <ins>shaping heritage policy implementation through planning and design interventions</ins> with complementary strands of impact on <ins>culture and creativity, practitioners and professional services</ins> and <ins>society</ins>. 

 Shaping heritage policy implementation through master planning: 

 Bandyopadhyay and Quattrone have developed ten heritage management masterplans and strategy documents covering all geo\-climatic regions of Oman, securing combined governmental investment of over GBP650,000. In 2016\-2017, following the delivery of Heritage Management Plans for Mirbat and Salalah **\[3.5\]** and Misfat **\[5.1\]**, ArCHIAM was commissioned to implement design interventions at 2 of these sites \(Salalah, Misfat\), significantly advancing the implementation of the 1980 Omani Royal Decree on the Protection of National Heritage. The management plans a\) produced implementable, fully economically costed masterplans, integrating development with conservation, and b\) shifted focus away from isolated monuments to settlements. Crucially, they helped the Misfat Cooperative – Al Misfat Al Ahlia – Bank Muscat and private stakeholders visualise and develop tangible partnerships in integrated tourism and economic development through design interventions. The National Heritage Council adopted the plans and disseminated these to stakeholder ministries \(in Arabic/English\), and directly to the public through the Heritage and Culture bookshop. 2000 bilingual booklets prepared by ArCHIAM were distributed to raise popular awareness of these initiatives, supported by national media coverage and state radio interviews. Following the Council’s recommendation, the Ministry of Tourism then invited ArCHIAM to develop a Heritage and Tourism Development Plan for the mountain oasis of Misfat al\-‘Abriyin **\[5.1\]**. The Plan “provided a well\-considered approach to showcase this heritage for tourists, and to facilitate appreciation through the development of tourism infrastructure and facilities for its stakeholders” and, once fully implemented, would “generate annual net gain in revenues of over GBP6,000,000” \(Undersecretary, Tourism\) **\[5.2.1\]**. The momentum around the Misfat masterplan has “assisted in driving an increase in the total number of guests stays to Ad\-Dakhiliyah governorate \[the administrative region\] of 43.3% from 127,000 in 2017 to 224,000 by the end of 2019, as well as increased visitation of 28.8% to the…key regional attractions” \(Undersecretary, Tourism\) **\[5.2.1\]**. Additionally, it has encouraged the Ministry of Tourism to earmark 2 more sites for development \(Birkat al\-Mawz; Izki\), which ArCHIAM had previously master\-planned, and the Office of the Minister of State and Governor of Dhofar to invite a tender for consultancy services for development and rehabilitation of two traditional quarters, one of which – Salalah al\-Wusta – was also master\-planned by ArCHIAM. This is expected to prompt “other ministries to take the initiative” for other heritage sites \(Expert, Tourism Services\) **\[5.2.2\]**. The Misfat masterplan encouraged the Oman government to select Harat al\-Bilad as a pilot project for heritage privatisation under its National Programme for Enhancing Economic Diversification, also known as Tanfeedh, “to develop with the local community and the other stakeholders” \(Director General, Tourism Development\) **\[5.2.2\]**. 

 ArCHIAM identified potential private partners in Misfat’s heritage development and mapped these against available governmental support **\[5.1\]**. To secure private funding for heritage management implementation \(a national first\), ArCHIAM worked closely with Al Misfat Al Ahlia and Bank Muscat. The momentum generated around Misfat in 2016\-2017 prompted Bank Muscat to fund the Phase\-1 implementation through its Corporate Social Responsibility Programme, increasing an initial commitment of GBP300,000 to GBP500,000 in recognition of the importance of this project’s contribution to national heritage and local development. The Misfat Phase\-1 implementation by ArCHIAM represented a pioneering public\-private initiative. This was the “first investment done by a bank in Oman” in heritage tourism development “to drive tourism to these heritage sites, encourage all other private sectors to look into these national projects as the impact is for the whole country” \(Head of Branding and Innovation, Bank Muscat\) **\[5.4.3\]**. The Ministry of Tourism is now “fully encouraging the approach adopted for developing Misfat al\-‘Abriyin” as a “role model” to communities and private stakeholders at other rural heritage sites \(Director General, Tourism Development\) **\[5.2.2\]**. 

 Changing professional practice through design implementation and training: 

 In 2016, Salalah masterplan led to the private commission to restore and reuse the 19<sup>th</sup>\-century Ghassani merchant family house \(Bait as\-Sail\), an excellent example of Salalah domestic architecture, as an interpretation centre. The intervention \(a\) introduced new approaches to local heritage design practice, showcasing both public\-private collaboration \(ministry, private owner\); \(b\) is the first adaptive reuse project in Oman, and \(c\) has helped to steer mainstream design and conservation practice in Oman towards sustainable development and sensitive contemporary design interventions in heritage sites. The Ghassani House conversion \( [view the Ghassani House brochure](https://issuu.com/archiam/docs/20190405_ghassani_house_brochure)\) has also changed design and procurement practice in the Omani private sector by creating a self\-sustaining private\-initiative\-led model for the interpretation centre. It stimulated over GBP400,000 private investment and employed a local SME contractor \(Mosha Trading Establishment\). 

 These approaches were scaled up to a settlement level when Bank Muscat awarded the Misfat Phase\-1 detailed design to ArCHIAM, who were supported by Muscat\-based consultant Architectural Wall Systems \(2017\-2018\). To introduce effective stakeholder participation in design for the first time in Oman, ArCHIAM and the Misfat Cooperative organised a two\-day community design workshop in Misfat \(July 2018; participation: 40; male/female: 65%/35%, age range: 6\-44 years; covered by press in Arabic and English\) **\[5.3.1\]**. These sessions recorded requirements and aspirations using models and montages that informed the eventual design and long\-term revenue generating strategies for a shop/info point, bakery and small restaurant. This public engagement initiative was publicised as a model for effective stakeholder participation in design nationwide and represented “a great opportunity for the local community to participate and give their opinions on how to safeguard, protect and develop their neighbourhood” \(91% would like to participate again\) **\[5.3.1\]**. The rehabilitated buildings featured in 2020 in a Bank Muscat\-commissioned video screened at the Misfat tourism development initiative completion ceremony in the presence of the Under\-Secretary of Heritage Affairs, the Bank’s CEO and the press **\[5.4.1:**  [**watch the video**](https://youtu.be/a2Q5aPI2Txc) **; 5.4.2\]**. “In 2020 three local Omani youth opened the Rogan Café in the restaurant building, responding to a national call for interest launched by Al Misfat Al Ahlia. The business employs 7 locals and has been generating a gross revenue of approximately GBP5,690 per month” **\[5.5.1\]**. 

 ArCHIAM’s pioneering adaptive reuse design was acknowledged as “different” and “added to \[local\] experience” \(Project Manager, Bank Muscat\) **\[5.4.3\]**. Its implementation  between January and December 2019 was supervised to completion by ArCHIAM/ AWS. It has enhanced the professional capacity of AWS, which had no previous heritage or adaptive reuse expertise. The practice “learnt…how to do design of heritage buildings, incorporating modern fusion into the projects”, and has since applied adaptive reuse in other private projects in Oman, supporting skills development in Omani architectural practice \(Senior Architect, AWS\) **\[5.4.3\]**. The contractor, Omani Services Establishment, which too had no previous adaptive reuse experience, employed on site 9 staff and personnel and 34 labourers and operators \(headcount: 43\), and learnt about community\-orientated implementation practice by involving, liaising and taking advice from the community, as well as fusing “modern and traditional concept \[of construction\]”, their “main achievement…from this project” \(Project Engineer, OSE\) **\[5.4.3; 5.4.4\]**. ‘Misfah Old House’, the only local B&B until recently, has seen a 25% increase in guest figures between 2016 and 2019 **\[5.5.2\]**. “On the back of the site development, 5 additional heritage style B&Bs have commenced operation in Misfat, with a further 2 under development” and “several additional activities have also emerged in the village including: a museum, a local honey and grocery store and a café selling local craft items” \(Undersecretary, Tourism\) **\[5.2.1\]**. 

 Global heritage conservation practice was enhanced through two further initiatives. The Getty Conservation Institute’s inaugural Middle Eastern conservation course included an ArCHIAM\-led week\-long training workshop at Harat al\-Bilad settlement, in Manah oasis, on urban conservation and reuse approaches \(November 2018; 22 professionals from 12 countries\). Bandyopadhyay was “involved in the visioning, development and delivery of the first course” at Harat al\-Bilad \(Head, Buildings and Sites, GCI\) **\[5.6.1\]**, “enhancing knowledge and shaping methodology for similar cultural sites” \(Participant, GCI course\) **\[5.6.2\]**. This marked a clear departure from established Getty practice of focusing entirely on buildings by moving the programme towards urban\-scale conservation and reuse training. Similarly, ArCHIAM’s role in the earthen architecture workshops in M’Hamid oasis, Morocco, led by Quattrone with the NGO Terrachidia \(2017 & 2019; 45 students/ professionals from 14 countries\), “was instrumental in teaching…heritage development approaches and principles, participatory design strategies and methods, thus effectively complementing Terrachidia’s hands\-on training in traditional earthen construction techniques” \(President, Terrachidia\) **\[5.6.3\]**. ArCHIAM’s work was globally disseminated \(2,256 views, 81 countries, 5 continents\) through an award\-winning documentary film, “very useful for architects and architecture students”, to “recommend to anyone about restoration and workshops” \(Coordinator, Istanbul International Architecture and Urban Films Festival\) **\[5.6.4:**  [**watch the film**](https://vimeo.com/338001258) **\]**. 

 Empowering communities through outreach and public engagement: 

 ArCHIAM helped structure the Misfat Cooperative \(Al Misfat Al Ahlia\), the first heritage cooperative constituency in Oman, earlier a small 5\-member company of young community members now formally approved with a 50\-plus household membership. Through the Misfat masterplan ArCHIAM successfully argued and developed guidelines for cooperative formation in consultation with the local community, and attended conflict resolution meetings organised by the local sheikh **\[5.1\]**. The Cooperative formation enabled the development of sites under complex ownership, making Phase\-1 implementation possible within the agreed timescale. Growing publicity surrounding Misfat masterplan attracted the Prince of Wales to visit Misfat \(5 November 2016\), which, along with an Al Jazeera documentary in Arabic \(2017\), enhanced the international visibility of the Cooperative. Today it advises the government on potential site development, as well as other rural communities about “how to convince people, how to change the culture, from where you start, what obstacles people have to take into consideration, how to tackle them in a professional way” \(Chairman, Al Misfat Al Ahlia\) **\[5.2.2\]**. 

 Museum content development for the National Museum on Omani traditional architecture and water management systems \( *aflaj*\) has raised awareness, enhanced perception and disseminated knowledge of the country’s history and heritage. ArCHIAM contributed to the Museum’s two prominent permanent galleries, ‘Civilisation in the Making Gallery’ and ‘ *Aflaj* Gallery’, through a curated feature wall of images and artefacts, digital visualisations and physical reconstructions, as well as touch screen interpretive material on the *aflaj* **\[5.7.1:**  [view the National Museum of Oman brochure](https://issuu.com/archiam/docs/brochures_national_museum_oman) **\]**. The feature wall was regarded as “impressive”and yet “straightforward” to comprehend by curators and guides, while the bilingual interactive touch\-screen display of the ‘ *Aflaj* Gallery’ “is a focal point” for the Museum’s French language guides and Visitor Services Specialists. The majority of the nearly 250, gender balanced, visitors surveyed \(72%\) were young students and professionals who felt inspired to undertake further research \(53%\) and attend talks and workshops \(32%\) following their visit to the galleries. For 77% of participants the touchscreen content as well as the knowledge presented on traditional architecture was very informative **\[5.7.2\]**. Funded by Research England \(UK\) and the National Museum, two workshops on Oman’s traditional architecture and *aflaj* irrigation system \(July 2019\) **\[5.7.3\]** engaged 40 schoolchildren, 7\-17 years old, through craft activities and quizzes that raised awareness and broadened knowledge of Oman’s history and cultural heritage amongst the younger generation. Approximately 80% of participants learnt about Omani traditional architecture for the first time at this workshop and expressed a desire to learn more about the subject by attending other workshops \(38%\), visiting traditional sites/ buildings \(26%\), watching documentaries/ visiting other exhibitions \(15% each\), and reading \(6%\). 90% of participants thought the workshop on the *aflaj* irrigation system substantially increased their knowledge on the subject **\[5.7.4\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The cassava brown streak virus \(CBSV\) molecular toolkit, developed by the University of Bristol \(UoB\), has enabled sustained virus\-free cassava production in sub\-Saharan Africa providing economic and food security. Long\-term disease surveillance and monitoring programmes show declines in national incidence and increased cassava production. Molecular diagnostics have enabled clean seed production by farmers in Uganda generating USD1,360,000. Breeding programs have developed CBSV tolerant strains. A new professional network – CONNECTED, includes 1,486 members from 83 countries, has pump\-primed technological innovations and delivered training to 87 individuals from 18 countries. Both CONNECTED and the molecular diagnostics toolkit have built capacity across industry researchers and agricultural practitioners to expand CBSV\-free cassava production and created invaluable professional networks. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Cassava \( *Manihot esculenta*\) produces carbohydrate‐rich storage roots, which are a staple food crop for approximately 800 million people worldwide. Cassava brown streak disease \(CBSD\), caused by Cassava brown streak viruses, generates losses typically 60\-70% of root harvest in susceptible varieties, as well as substantial reduction of market value due to necrotic lesions. CBSD has become an extremely serious constraint to cassava production in East Africa, as well as a threat to cassava production throughout Africa. 

 In 2001, ground\-breaking UoB research, led by Foster and Bailey and funded by Department for International Development \(DFID\) \[i\], identified and characterised segments of the cassava brown streak virus genome by a complex combination of viral purification, cDNA synthesis and sequencing methods \[1\], showing CBSV to be an Ipomovirus in the Potyviridae. These data enabled development of the first diagnostic tests \[2\] to ensure accurate and rapid identification of diseased material. 

 From 2010 to 2015, UoB research led by Foster and Bailey developed a new method to generate infectious clones \(ICs\) to plant viruses using yeast\-based recombinational cloning. Initially reported for the *Pepino mosaic virus* \[3\], these new approaches were then applied to Cassava brown streak viruses, with infectious clones generated for the first time against these important pathogens \[4\]. UoB research used these clones to allow pathogenicity factors to be identified as well as the *in vivo* tracking of live virus, with viral targets for plant breeding programmes identified \[5, 6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Cassava brown streak disease \(CBSD\) is one of the seven most dangerous plant diseases in the world due to the impact it can have on food and economic security. 500 million people in Africa depend on cassava, which is the second most important food staple in terms of per capita calories consumed. 

 Following a major outbreak of CBSD in East Africa in 2004, the cassava molecular toolkit developed at UoB \[1, 2\] was crucial to eliminating infected material, establishing clean fields and producing clean seeds for distribution. The diagnostic protocols \[1, 2\] were adopted by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture \(IITA\), National Agricultural Research Organisation \(NARO\) \(Uganda\), and Food and Environment Research Agency \(Fera\), working across Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and DRC. This large\-scale effort prevented the spread of CBSD from East to West Africa, safeguarding food and economic security. 

#  Sustained virus\-free cassava production in Africa 

#  *Surveillance and molecular monitoring* 

 The cassava brown streak molecular toolkit \[1\-6\] developed by Foster and Bailey remains central to the efforts in Africa to enable virus\-free cassava production. Monger *et al.* \(2001b\) \[2\] was the first ever diagnostic to be used and deployed, paving the way for the development of at least seven 2<sup>nd</sup> generation diagnostic tests that are routinely used \[B\]. Molecular diagnostic tests are used for ‘ *detection, tracking and mapping distribution of CBSVs, therefore contributing real time updated occurrence information and CBSD management measures’* \[B\]. In Uganda, evidence gathered through this process shows that national incidence of CBSD declined by 7% from 2010 to 2017 and cassava production increased from 2,800,000 metric tons \(2008\) to 3,400,000 metric tons \(2019\) \[B\]. 

 Recent research developments \[4, 5, 6\], which improve understanding of the pathology of CBSD are *‘critical to develop robust control measures’* \[Ai\]. The Central and West African Virus Epidemiology \(WAVE\) team at Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire are using this understanding to “build individual and institutional capacity around diagnostics, especially phytosanitary officers” who can monitor the cross\-border trade in cassava planting material. In 2019\-20, WAVE initiated national workshops for cassava value chain stakeholders in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo to prepare country response plans to CBSD \[C\]. 

 FERA Science Limited have noted that UoB’s research their work since 2014 has made seed testing with diagnostics, “ *a mainstay of the Foundations investment to seed systems to Africa, spanning cassava, maize, sweet potato and yam amongst other crops. What also changed by the good example of the GLCI was the inclusion of National Seed Authorities, charged with certification of seed, as main partners*” \[D\]. They add that *“Deploying, or positioning, diagnostic capability into seed certification providers is therefore another attribute of change that can be associated with cassava, controlling CBSD and the early work of Bristol University.”* 

  

#  *Clean seed and planting material* 

 Improved diagnostics and virus therapy protocols enable the distribution of ‘health’ certified planting material to users, from at least 10 countries each year \[Ai\]. Official seed certification systems in Uganda and Tanzania have incorporated CBSV testing into quality assurance frameworks \[B\]. NARO report that *‘between 2015\-2016, Ugandan farmer seed entrepreneurs earned estimated USD1.1 million in sales of certified cassava planting material to local growers and USD260,000 from exports to Rwanda’* \[B\]. 

#  *Breeding CBSD tolerant cassava varieties* 

 The molecular diagnostics tests \[1, 2\], also play a crucial role in the plant breeding process to determine virus occurrence and accumulation in promising genotypes. This approach has led to the identification of six CBSD tolerant varieties now widely used in sub\-Saharan Africa \[B\]. 

 Recent development of virus infectious clones \(ICs\) \[4\], and viral targets for plant breeding programmes \[5 ,6\] has improved understanding of the pathology of CBSD and provided breeders and biotechnologists with effective tools to assess virus resistance. The Head of the Germplasm Health Unit at IITA notes that *‘The new knowledge on CBSV\-cassava interaction are helping IITA’s cassava breeding program aimed to develop CBSD resistant cultivars.”* \[Ai\]. The Principal Scientist at NARO also anticipates that virus ICs will improve the *‘efficiency of germplasm screening’* \[B\]. 

 Despite the promise of ICs to generate resistant crop varieties, secure use close to the target crops requires Category 3 \(Cat3\) genetic containment facilities. A report led by Foster and Bailey, ‘BioSafety requirements for the use of *Cassava Brown Streak* Virus Infectious Clones in Africa’, commissioned by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \[Ji\], established the exact GM Cat3 lab facilities and regulations for the use of viral infectious clones in Africa. In 2019, Foster and Bailey hosted a Gates Foundation sponsored meeting with delegates from East and West Africa and international policy makers, to establish policy for use of viral ICs. Agreement was reached on protocols and facilities required and these policies have been presented and supported by the relevant regulatory authorities in African countries, enabling the designed Cat3 facilities to be constructed. In a unique collaboration between architects and engineers, a design for an off\-site construction of a complex and portable Cat3 lab has been developed through to full design integration, sourcing of elements, costings, full logistics and legalization plans, and is ready for receiving funding and initiating deployment. 

#  Building capacity in agricultural practice in Africa – CONNECTED 

 In 2018, the COmmunity Network for africaN vECTor borne plant viruses **–** CONNECTED, funded by UKRI\-BBSRC \[ii\], established a sustainable network of international scientists and researchers to address the challenges of vector\-borne plant viruses in Sub\-Saharan Africa. CONNECTED now represents 1,486 members from 83 countries who are forging and consolidating links with funders, farmers, stakeholders and policy makers, to provide the collaborative, multidisciplinary approach essential for tackling vector\-borne disease. 

#  *Technological interventions addressing agricultural pests and disease* 

 CONNECTED also provides pump\-prime funding for short\-term research projects generating technology innovations which reduce the burden of agricultural pests and disease. The 20 projects to date have involved 33 institutions, 55 researchers, 11 crops and 14 countries. The most developed technologies include: 

 *i\) Improved disease detection in the field* 

 A mobile app for detection of maize lethal necrosis \(MLN\). Database development via insertion of images showing different disease symptoms including MLN/AMLN is ongoing. Using digital imaging, the system is field\-trained to recognize/identify MLN tobetter detect the disease. 

  

 *ii\) Novel diagnostic kit* 

 A new diagnostic protocol was developed that specifically detects the episomal form of badnaviruses infecting yam. This directly benefited from our advances on CBSD diagnostics. 

  

 *iii\) First licensed entomopathogenic fungi \(EPF\) lab* 

 Early career researchers developed new specialist skills in the biology of EPF and their evaluation as biopesticides. Insect pathology laboratories were established at IITA and Wesley University. To our knowledge, the facility established at Wesley University is the first licenced EPF laboratory in Nigeria. A method was developed for evaluating the susceptibility of cassava whitefly to fungal biopesticides, and commercial biopesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi were evaluated against cassava whitefly at laboratory and field scales. 

#  *Delivery of skills training* 

 CONNECTED provides resources and information exchange to enable more effective plant vector\-borne disease research, as well as training to improve agricultural methods, products and services that increase crop yield and reduce losses. CONNECTED has delivered training in partnership with UK and institutes in East Africa \[H\] and West Africa \[Gi\] enabling them to fulfil their pan\-African training mandates \[H\], preventing duplication of efforts. 

 To date, CONNECTED has trained 87 individuals from 18 countries across India and South Asia as well the UK \[I\], and from across the agricultural value chain including universities, national research institutes, private companies, NPPOs, plant health and seed certification organisations and international research organisations \[G\]. In a survey in January 2020 \[I\], 70% of participants report improvements to their research as a result of CONNECTED training, and 88% improvements to their teaching. Every respondent had shared their knowledge with others, at least 359 further scientists and professionals, and 85% had continued to build the professional network of scientists created through CONNECTED. 

 Partner organisations, East\-West Seed Group, National Agricultural Seeds Council \(NASC\) and International Institute of Tropical Agriculture \(IITA\), all highlight the dissemination of training  through their organisations, as well as the importance of the creation and strengthening of professional networks across Sub\-Saharan Africa \[E, F, G\]. East\-West Seed Group note that their employee was able to disseminate training to her team enabling them to ‘ *apply these new skills to their plant sampling work’* and contribute to a current research project *‘more effectively’* \[Eii\]. They also describe the networking across certification organisations, national and international research institutes and universities, as ‘ *invaluable’* \[Ei\]. NASC likewise report that skills and new knowledge have been used and shared in the 6 months since the training \[F\] and *‘extremely valuable’* professional connections have been established with researchers working in a *‘variety of contexts’* \[F\]. *‘The impact this training is already having is greatly appreciated in East Africa’* \[Gii\]. 

#  *Increased awareness of policy makers and public* 

 CONNECTED also provide tools to help engagement with policy makers, funders and the public. In 2019, a short animation to explain the impact, spread and importance of cassava whitefly transmitted diseases in accessible language was widely disseminated and viewed. This animation was selected to be shown at two UK film festivals, Encounters and Depict. In an African based poll, the CONNECTED Network won the award of *“GROUP that made the greatest contribution on Twitter promoting African Agricultural Transformation in 2018”.*

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Surrey's spatial audio research has generated substantial economic, societal and cultural impacts via three main knowledge\-transfer activities: \(1\) commercialisation of sound zone technology, \(2\) public engagement with spatial audio experiences, \(3\) next\-generation audio technology for UK and global audiences. Surrey’s sound zone technology was patented and commercialised by Bang & Olufsen \(B&O\), featuring in their BeoLab and BeoSound Balance products. The pioneering object\-based audio research at Surrey has resulted in next\-generation technology and vital new capabilities for audio production, which have engaged audiences of many thousands worldwide. As a direct result of Surrey’s collaboration, the BBC have new spatial audio tools and European Broadcasting Union \(EBU\) standards for next\-generation audio and are embedding this technology into UK\-based media production infrastructure for global distribution. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Spatial audio technology offers completely enveloping sound from all around the listener, as in real life, creating a far more immersive experience than conventional audio. It is the natural and necessary complement to high\-resolution video. Sound zones deliver this without headphones by cancelling crosstalk, enabling users to experience personalised content in the same room. 

 The University of Surrey’s Centre for Vision, Speech & Signal Processing \(CVSSP\), led by Hilton since 2012, is globally\-recognised for its strengths in acoustical and visual signal processing. Complementing these strengths is Surrey’s Institute of Sound Recording \(IoSR\), with particular expertise in auditory perception. 

 Working collaboratively within two research projects on multi\-channel acoustical systems: Perceptually Optimised Sound Zones \(POSZ\) and Future Object\-Based Spatial Audio \(S3A\), CVSSP developed sound zone technology **\[R1, R2\]**, audio device orchestration **\[R3\]** and object\-based audio systems **\[R4, R5, R6\]**. 

 **Sound zone technology** 

 Sound zone systems aim to control the sound such that multiple listeners can enjoy different audio programmes within the same room with minimal acoustic interference. 

 The POSZ project \(2010\-14\) was conceived by Jackson to combine sound zone engineering with psychoacoustics to predict and evaluate perceived sound quality. CVSSP conducted engineering research collaboratively with B&O engineers, whilst IoSR performed psychoacoustic research with B&O psychoacousticians resulting in 24 publications, 4 these, 3 patents and 2 datasets. This project established scientific foundations for the practical realisation of sound zones including the suitability of energy focusing, energy cancellation, and synthesis approaches for sound zone reproduction **\[R1\]**. Regularisation was also shown to control effects on the array effort and achieved acoustic contrast between zones alongside the trade\-off between acoustic contrast and fidelity of the target audio programme in the zone **\[R2\]**. 

  

 **Audio device orchestration and object\-based audio systems** 

 The S3A project \(2013\-19 EP/L000539/1\) brought leading international experts in 3D audio and visual processing \(including The University of Salford and University of Southampton\) together with the BBC and UK creative industry. This Surrey\-led, EPSRC funded five\-year programme aimed to enable listeners at home to experience the sense of ""being there"" at live events \(e.g., concerts, football matches\) through immersive sound. The project has resulted in a large body of work including 8 datasets and over 170 publications, seminal outcomes include: 

1.  Inventing 'audio orchestration' \(AO\); using ad\-hoc consumer media devices delivering object\-based spatial audio to enhance immersion **\[R3\]**. In contrast to traditionally\-conceived spatial audio, this system relied on semantic metadata describing the audio objects and a rule set for automatically adapting the reproduction across the loudspeakers on all connected devices. Listener feedback showed a positive experience due to the increased immersion compared with stereo reproduction, and that the orchestration approach worked particularly well for drama content. 

1.  An object\-based approach for capturing, parameterising, editing, and rendering reverberation over a 3D spatial audio system **\[R4\]**. A Reverberant Spatial Audio Object \(RSAO\) embellishes a recorded sound object by synthesizing the desired room impression. In listener tests, RSAO was shown to convey room size and source distance correctly and modulate listener perception of these. 

1.  An end\-to\-end object\-based spatial audio pipeline \- from sound recording to listening **\[R5\]**. The high\-level system architecture introduced audio\-visual interfaces to support object\-based capture and listener\-tracked rendering, and proposed objectification components, recording content directly into objects. Through experimentation, the research team demonstrated that the system's novel components extended scope and capabilities beyond state of the art. 

1.  Finally, a system architecture for semantically informed rendering \(SIR\) that combines object\-based audio rendering with high\-level processing of object metadata **\[R6\]**. This processing uses novel, advanced metadata describing the objects to adjust the audio scene to the reproduction system and listener preferences. Examples demonstrated that SIR can significantly improve the media experience and provide advanced personalisation controls, for example, by maintaining smooth object trajectories on systems with few loudspeakers or providing personalised envelopment levels. 

 These outcomes from the POSZ and S3A projects represent the origin of an expansive research portfolio that culminated in the impact described.

 **The commercialisation of sound zone technology** 

 Bang & Olufsen \(B&O\) are world\-renowned for their high\-end luxury audio products; their innovative and progressive products are sold worldwide. B&O employ over 1,000 people and operate in more than 70 markets. Surrey’s sound zone technology research **\[R1, R2\]** resulted in a number of new B&O products and commercial success, B&O’s Research Director confirms: 

 “The fundamental knowledge developed in POSZ has made us capable of developing and using advanced directivity control where BeoLab 90 was the first product utilising this. Then followed BeoLab 50. BeoSound Balance and two new products will be released shortly *.”* **\[S1\]** 

 BeoLab 90 launched in November 2015, retailing at £61,000, and is described in the B&O 2015/2016 Annual report as their “< *…>* new flagship loudspeaker offering unprecedented level of control of acoustic behaviour and performance, making BeoLab 90 one of the most innovative speakers on the market”. **\[S2\]** The technologies and know\-how gained from the development of BeoLab 90 have been applied to subsequent Bang & Olufsen loudspeaker products. 

 B&O’s Annual Report 2015/16 also confirmed the commercial success of BeoLab 90: 

 “Revenue from the Speaker category increased 26 per cent compared to last year. Thereby, the share of revenue from the Speaker category was unchanged at 18 per cent compared to last year. Speaker sales were positively impacted by the launch of Bang & Olufsen’s new flagship speaker, BeoLab 90 which has been very well received in the market *.*” **\[S2\]** 

 As a result of their research collaboration \(2014\-2016\) with Surrey, B&O filed several patents relating to sound zone technology, each naming Surrey researchers as inventors **\[S3\]**. In May 2015, HARMAN International Industries \(which later became a subsidiary of Samsung\) announced its acquisition of Bang & Olufsen Automotive, B&O's car audio business unit. The sound zone patents **\[S3\]** were licensed as part of Harman’s €145M purchase of B&O’s automotive business \(2015\) **\[S1\]**. 

 HARMAN subsequently launched 'individual sound zones' \(ISZ\). In 2016, HARMAN was recognised by  [Fast Company](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com&esheet=51280461&newsitemid=20160216006480&lan=en-US&anchor=Fast+Company&index=2&md5=0fd305e5f36e6eaba523bd60f2640fac) as one of the  [Top Ten Most Innovative Companies in Automotive](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com%2Fcompany%2Fharman&esheet=51280461&newsitemid=20160216006480&lan=en-US&anchor=Top+Ten+Most+Innovative+Companies+in+Automotive&index=3&md5=f6aadceba2b7f0f0eca8fe1e8cc1fca1) and reported sales of $6.5B \(2015\) and $6.91B \(2016\) **\[S4\]**. Automotive backlog of awarded business also hit a record high of $24.1B in 2016 following the launch of their innovative audio systems, including ISZ **\[S5\]**. 

 **Public engagement with spatial audio** 

 Showcasing the potential of, and engaging audiences in, next\-generation audio is a critical step in the BBC and other providers investing in new tools and ultimately content. As such, the S3A project provided the BBC with such an opportunity: 

 “Three distinct pieces were produced to test out concepts relating to different strands of the research. All three of these productions were made possible through the cooperation and collaboration of the S3A project partners, the Universities of Surrey, Salford and Southampton, with BBC R&D.” **\[S6\]** 

 **The Turning Forest is the BBC’s first publicly released VR experience built on spatial audio content designed, commissioned, recorded and produced with S3A and its object\-based production system to render sounds from any direction **\[R5, S7\].** It premiered at Tribeca Film Festival \(attendance c150,000\), then at festivals in England, Scotland, France, Germany, USA, Canada and Australia, plus many community, industry and scientific events. It won the TVB Europe Award for Best Achievement in Sound \(2016\) **\[S8\]** and a nomination for Best VR Experience at the Google Play Awards \(2017\). 

 The BBC publicised The Turning Forest via their Taster website. Its YouTube trailer has >24,000 views, and overall audience reach c100k since distributed globally on Google Play \(58.5k downloads to Sept 2020\) and for Oculus Go and Samsung VR \(24.1k downloads to Feb 2020\). 

 **The Vostok\-K Incident** \(2018\) was commissioned and produced by S3A using ground\-breaking research in audio orchestration **\[R3\]** of spatial sound across multiple consumer devices to create an immersive experience. **\[S9\]** 

 Vostok\-K was launched on BBC Taster, where it received >5.9k unique views, with 72% of viewers saying they “would use the technology again” and scoring it 4/5 overall **\[S6\]**. The launch was widely covered in the media, including the Daily Telegraph, Financial Times *,* BBC Radio South, BBC Radio Surrey and BBC Click. The BBC has subsequently formed a team to develop the Audio Orchestrator technology resulting in multiple productions, including BBC Philharmonic 2020 \( [www.bbc.co.uk/taster/pilots/pick\-a\-part](https://www.bbc.co.uk/taster/pilots/pick-a-part)\), Monster 2020 \( [www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2020\-10\-audio\-drama\-monster\-interactive\-sound](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2020-10-audio-drama-monster-interactive-sound)\), and public release of the Audio Orchestrator as a community tool for sound engineers  \( [https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper375](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper375)\), resulting in >300 requests to use the tool. Audience response research consistently indicates >70% of users say they would like to use this technology again. 

 In 2019, the BBC and S3A co\-produced an episode of Casualty to evaluate S3A’s research on the use of object\-based narrative importance to improve speech accessibility for broadcast integrated within a version of iPlayer \(>8k views on BBC Taster and positive audience feedback\). 

 Together, these trials were pivotal in informing the BBC’s future strategy, and as a result of their success, the BBC established its Virtual Reality Hub, producing 14 VR experiences over two years **\[S6\]**. The BBC Lead R&D Engineer confirms, “The S3A project has had a major influence on BBC R&D’s work on object\-based media in recent years, demonstrating the technical capabilities and audience value clearly. These ideas have fed into our thinking on projects such as the StoryKit and our plans for the New BBC Ecosystem.” **\[S6\]** 

 **Next\-generation audio technology** 

 Since stereo's first broadcast 59 years ago, the systems and infrastructure have evolved worldwide to support channel\-based audio. Next\-generation audio \(NGA\) reflects a major global transformation in broadcast and internet\-delivered media services for improved listening experiences, using object\-based techniques to make audio more immersive and personalisable. The BBC’s Lead R&D Engineer confirms Surrey’s critical role \(via S3A\) in enabling next\-generation audio: 

 “The BBC’s role has been in creating interoperable standards for NGA production and distribution. The S3A research work contributed directly to the BBC’s work on the Rec. ITU\-R BS.2127 standard that specifies algorithms for rendering the Audio Definition Model. This has recently been implemented in the EAR Production Suite \( [https://ear\-productionsuite.ebu.io/](https://ear-productionsuite.ebu.io/)\), a project by the European Broadcasting Union.” **\[S6\]** 

 The BBC and EBU have also adopted S3A object\-based audio datasets as reference material for the NGA standards, including the Audio Definition Model Renderer and the Binaural NGA Renderer. This underpinned a binaural production of Doctor Who in 2017.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research on power plant condition monitoring led by Prof Chengke Zhou has continued to grow outputs since 2014, and has had further impact on the way power cables and motors are monitored. Insulation defects are analysed at a major power generation company which supplies over 20% of the UK’s power generation, providing the company with innovative techniques enabling them to identify the existence and nature of insulation defects, taking pre\-empt actions and improve their maintenance decision making. In January 2018, the research output helped the company to reduce maintenance and outage costs by over ten million pounds in one incident. Further research work on power plant asset management contributed to the International Council on Large Electric Systems \(CIGRE\) Brochure 706: International Guidelines on use of Statistics and Statistical Tools for Analysis of Asset Life Data, and has had an impact on optimal maintenance and replacement of power assets owned by power industry worldwide, via asset life redefinition and extension. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research work underpinning the impact on the topic of condition monitoring started in 1999 and has since involved around 25 academics and research staff/students. Research outputs enabled autonomous partial discharge \(PD\) pulse identification, phase resolved pattern recognition and knowledge discovery from condition monitoring data accumulated over time. The work received six pieces of grant awards \[G1\-G6\], including two major EPSRC funded projects prior to the current REF assessment period. The work led to the development of novel PD monitoring kits for EDF Energy, and enabled the power generation company to monitor their 11kV cable conditions in noisy environments where previous technology from commercial service providers failed. 

 Since 2014, Prof Zhou has collaborated with EDF to identify further scientific and technological advances required to meet the challenges faced by the power industry. Two research grants awarded from the company between 2013 and 2019 allowed research work to further develop novel techniques in automating the denoising and pattern recognition of PD measurement, whilst extending the previously developed smart PD recognition techniques from power cable to motor monitoring. Building on previous research work, Prof Zhou developed another autonomous pattern recognition method, namely, the Fractal methods \[R1\], for separating the source and identifying the types of defects within cables and motors. This pioneering work is significant in that the classification of PD activities using the fractal pattern enabled any phase resolved pattern to be determined with improved resolution, allowing the identification of the defect location \(cable or motor connected at the end of cable\) and the determination of likely failure modes, which allows the appropriate measures to be taken against the nature of the defect. Previously developed pattern recognition techniques failed to function because of the lack of voltage phase resolved reference signals in online monitoring. Novel thermal models and sheath currents monitoring techniques \[R2\] were developed and enabled examination of the severity of defects \[R3\]. 

 Research underpinning the second impact lies in the use of statistical models developed to forecast the remaining life of essential assets and to evaluate the outcome of various maintenance actions. Contributions at GCU included the selection of statistical models and processing of historical asset failure data \[R4, R5\], and the design of a technique to identify significant factors of failure which would enable a utility to improve the asset’s procurement, its maintenance and replacement due to redefined asset life. The contribution is extremely important as it signposted how to manage when there is incomplete information, which is often the case among utilities worldwide. Research also presented methods in how to evaluate remaining life of cable assets, with findings showing that many high voltage cables may provide reliable service of 60 years, which is double the design life of 30 years \[R6\]. Recently, the Scottish Power Energy Network has commissioned Prof Zhou to deploy his research work to improve the PD monitoring and life redefinition of their cable assets \[G6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Impact 1:</ins> 

 The power generation company in question owns eight nuclear power stations which supply 22% of the electricity generated in the UK. Prior to January 2014, the PD monitoring equipment which came as a result of the GCU research work helped in identifying insulation problems. This led one of the nuclear power stations to replace all existing cables with cables from the same manufacturer, thereby avoiding further breakdowns \[C1\]. The hardware of the instrumentation and the software package, capable of detecting PDs with a magnitude of under 10 pico\-Coulomb has been developed at GCU. The system included high sampling rate \(100M Sample/s, 4 channel synchronous sampling\) and high resolution \(12 bits\) data acquisition unit, second generation wavelet based data processing and denoising, K\-means and Fractal \[R1, R6\] based PD pattern recognition, trending analysis, database management, and insulation defect diagnostics. The product has since been applied to 7 UK nuclear power stations between 2015 and 2020. During the measurement campaigns, it was demonstrated that the cable PD monitoring system can not only detect PD activities emanating from cables but it is also capable of detecting and distinguishing PDs originating from motors located hundreds of metres away from the measurement point. In comparison with the existing practice requiring retrofitting on\-line monitoring units while power plants are off\-service, the technique allows the medium voltage motors driving gas circulators and cooling water pumps in the nuclear power stations to be condition monitored much more conveniently and at significantly reduced cost \[C1\], as research work enabled autonomous signal analysis and PD events recognition. This allowed maintenance engineers to gain an insight into the location, nature and severity of the problem instantly during condition monitoring and inspections. 

 In January 2018, the GCU team successfully undertook a measurement campaign in a power station where a 275kV cable was found to have 6 Celsius degrees local elevated temperature rise, and ruled out that the event was due to PD activities as reported by other commercial providers. They further provided in\-depth simulation and analysis, with the thermal insulation model developed at GCU \[R2\], and identified the reasons behind, as well as the severity of the problem. Based on the scientific evidence and recommendations provided by GCU research, the company decided to defer the replacement and avoided an unnecessary outage, and saved potentially tens of millions of pounds \[C1\]. Technically the GCU work enabled them to carry out regular PD testing which would otherwise be impossible. 

 <ins>Impact 2:</ins> 

 Based on the research in the last 8 years in the area of asset management and statistical analysis of failure events, over 10 publications were produced in IEEE Transactions and IET Journals \[R1\-R6\]. As a result, Prof Zhou was invited to become a key member in the CIGRE working group D1.39 and C1.38. He then contributed 2 chapters to the CIGRE Brochure 706: “Guidelines for the Use of Statistics and Statistical tools on Asset Life Data”, which is impacting on the practice among power utilities worldwide \[C2\]. This has become essential for utilities to extend the service life of existing power plant assets, which has a potential saving of billions of pounds. Recently, The Scottish Power Energy Network has commissioned Prof Zhou to deploy his research work to improve the PD monitoring and maintenance practice of their cable assets \[G6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Mastrobuoni’s research on reducing criminal activity **,** led to the first independent evaluation of a recent IT innovation “predictive policing”.  This research has been pivotal in the continued use of KeyCrime’s predictive policing software called ‘delia®’ in the city of Milan which has been shown to dramatically reduce crime. Importantly this research enabled KeyCrime to grow from a start\-up to partnering with IBM, PSS and sdg Group delivering innovative software to police forces outside Italy. 

 Mastrobuoni's research on prison conditions that reduce criminal recidivism is the single piece of research that informed changes in the basic standards for prison conditions in Italy. The Commissioner for prison reform in Italy and the Guarantor of the rights of persons deprived of personal liberty in Milan drew on the Essex research to evidence the role that prison conditions play in the tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Mastrobuoni’s paper \[R1, initially published as a working paper in 2014\] is the first independent and quasi\-experimental evaluation of a recently popularized IT innovation, called “predictive policing”, which collects and analyses data on past criminal events \(specifically commercial robberies\) to predict future events. Police patrols are given these predictions and are asked to plan their routes accordingly to increase their clearance or arrest rates and reduce crime \[R2\]. The system is shown to dramatically increase clearance rates by 30% and reduce crime by 64% \(due to repeat offending, crime rates are shown to be a highly non\-linear function of clearance rates\). 

 Essex research shows that predictive policing improves clearing crimes committed by criminals of all ability levels. Mastrobuoni and Rivers \[R3\] developed a methodology on how to measure such ability levels. Microdata on bank robberies are used to estimate individual\-level disutilities of imprisonment, which are strictly related to the robbers’ abilities. In particular, the identification rests on the money versus apprehension trade\-off that robbers face inside the bank when deciding whether to leave or collect money for an additional minute. The distribution of the disutility of prison is not degenerate, generating heterogeneity in behaviour. The results show that unobserved heterogeneity in robber ability is important for explaining outcomes in terms of haul and arrest. Furthermore, higher ability robbers are found to be more likely to use firearms and to work with partners. Predictive policing is also pivotal in arresting these more able criminals. 

 Arrests and subsequent incarcerations generate an incapacitation effect that is shown to reduce crime but while in prison it is extremely important to rehabilitate inmates. Essex research evaluates the type of prison conditions that are more likely to reduce criminal recidivism. 

 Mastrobuoni and Terlizzese \[R4\] use quasi\-random variation in the fraction of time served in the Italian “open prison” of Bollate to estimate the effect of rehabilitation efforts on recidivism. The assignment to prison conditions may be endogenous, and the paper restricts the analysis to inmates who, due to overcrowding in nearby prisons, are displaced to a rehabilitating prison \(Bollate\), controlling for observed and unobserved measures of potential selection. Spending one more year at the rehabilitating prison \(and one less year at an ordinary one\) reduces recidivism by between 10 and 15 percentage points \(from a mean recidivism of about 40 percent\). For the group of displaced inmates, which is shown to be negatively selected, the effects of rehabilitation efforts on recidivism are larger. While the research found evidence that over time Bollate inmates become more likely to work outside the prison, more than a single mechanism, seem to underlie these effects.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Validation of predictive policing software** 

 Mastrobuoni’s research on the economics of crime evaluates both reducing criminal activity through predictive policing but also the tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend. His research on bank robberies to estimate individual\-level disutilities of imprisonment, based on a collaboration with the Italian Banking Association \(Associazione Bancaria Italiana\), \[R3\] led to an ongoing collaboration with an Assistente Capo in the Italian Police who established an innovative start\-up company ‘KeyCrime’, specialising in a predictive policing software called ‘delia®’. 

 The founder of KeyCrime approached Mastrobuoni to research the impact of data analysis on police investigations. The results of the long\-run pilot in Milan alongside the academic evaluation of KeyCrime’s predictive policing software by Mastrobuoni \[R1\] created significant interest in the software \(which was later named delia®\), guided it’s development and enabled the founder to leave the police force in 2017 in order to run the company as a viable business \[S1\]. 

 The evaluation by Professor Mastrobuoni guided the development of this predictive policing software from early on in the company’s inception, which subsequently influenced the efficacy of police investigations in Milan. On the collaboration the Founder and CEO of KeyCrime confirms: '… *Research and the first independent evaluation of any predictive policing software, 'Crime is Terribly Revealing' by Professor Mastrobuoni enabled KeyCrime to validate its results \[R1\]...The software has produced validated results in the area of prevention and repression of crime which can be seen in the data made public by the system's users, the Polizia di Stato in Italy. Other institutions have also supported the use of KeyCrime such as the office of Prosecutors of Milan who, in their annual report cite it as a useful tool to support their investigation’.* \[S1\] 

 The evaluation undertaken by Mastrobuoni \[R1\] also cemented the formal adoption of the software by law enforcement agencies in Italy in 2018 \[S2\]. It is embedded into Italy’s national police force, the Polizia di Stato, in the Province and city of Milan where they have reported a 58% reduction in commercial robberies in the city of Milan and 89% reduction in the province of Milan for bank robberies over the period that the software has been deployed \[S3\]. 

 The Founder and CEO of KeyCrime states: *'The publication of the paper \[R1\]  has, without any doubt, brought additional attention to the company KeyCrime s.r.l \- an innovative start\-up formed at the beginning of 2018 \- as well as credibility due to the scientific and statistical validation detailed in Professor Mastrobuoni's paper. This validation is a fundamental element for us and has helped guide the direction of our investment in R&D to extend the approach that the paper described'*. \[S1\]. 

 KeyCrime now has 20 employees and has received millions of euros of finance from venture capital firms. In 2018 formal partnerships with companies sharing a common vision to help make communities safer were announced with IBM and sdg Group \(one of the most important company in the Multinational Analytics Market\) to propose delia® software to the global market for corporate use and to deliver a delia® based solution at the consumer level. While in 2020, PSS, an important Spanish system interrogator, has partnered with KeyCrime to resell delia® predictive policing software to the Spanish and Latin American markets \[S3a\]. 

 Following the pilot phase after the evaluation of the software by Mastrobuoni \[R1\], a statement by Milan’s Head of the State Police in the Giornale scientifico a cura di O.N.A.P December 2014 confirmed the benefits achieved by the predictive policing software which was subsequently formally adopted 

 “*The uses of KeyCrime, which was experimented in Milan’s Police headquarter, have largely met and overcame our expectations. It has proven itself not only capable of meeting our operative needs, but also of indirectly contributing to let the administration’s cost plummet, in a period in which the resources have to be rationalized and well managed in order to grant high security standards in our cities. Thanks to the use of this system, Milan’s Police headquarters succeeded in significantly reducing bank and commercial\-related robberies, becoming a deterrent; this was also possible thanks to the success in identifying numerous perpetrators of such crimes”.* \[S4\] 

 **Reducing recidivism** 

 Professor Mastrobuoni's research on evaluating the prison conditions that are more likely to aid rehabilitation and reduce criminal recidivism \[R3\] was used by the Commissioner for prison reform in Italy and the Guarantor of the rights of persons deprived of personal liberty in Milan to evidence the role that the condition of prisons plays in the tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend. This was the only research cited in the House of Representatives by the Commissioner for prison reform in January 2018 in relation to the XVII legislature and recorded by the Bulletin of the Joints and Parliamentary Committees Justice \[S5\]. The Guarantor utilises Mastrobuoni’s research to evidence that prisons with a higher rate of condition, \(such as Bollate\), should be considered as a model for the entire penitentiary system to improve reductions of recidivism and positive reintegration of convicted criminals at the end of their sentence \[S6\]. Subsequent recommendations set out by the prison reform commission and the Guarantor, include a booklet published in 2018, ‘Norms and Normality’ which contains a set of standards for the incarceration of adults in Italy including that the standards of detention should not be just ‘minimum’ \[S7\]. 

 The Guarantor of the rights of persons deprived of personal liberty by the Municipality of Milan’s \(est. 2012\), whose mandate includes the promotion of rights and opportunities of persons deprived of their liberty, cites Mastrobuoni’s research \[R4\] in its 2015 Annual Report \[S8\].

The model has the key property of including multiple strains whilst also being computationally and mathematically tractable **\[R1\]**. In **\[R2\]**, key innovations were presented that made the model framework applicable for prediction for seasonal influenza in humans. Most importantly, **\[R2\]** developed the mathematical framework to combine two different forms of virus strain fitness: antigenic fitness \(dependent on population immune states\) and inherent transmission fitness \(independent of population state\). This model included more complex interplay between antigenic and genetic spaces for strains than anything presented previously. This work also included a number of other important strain modelling innovations: a new way to implement a discrete time strain model; a strain space that is extensible during a simulation; a tractable way to include temporary broad immunity that runs across all strains; and exploration of vaccination strategies. All of these are valuable for practical usage as a predictive model. In **\[R3\]**, Gog considered how the model could be extended to deal with the emergence of new disease strains, evaluating which elements of modelling frameworks permit flexibility yet maintain biological realism. 

 All the above properties of the multi\-strain model of seasonal influenza mean that it is suitable to being incorporated into a larger framework that can be used to predict the evolution of influenza, in particular the strain of influenza that will be dominant in the next influenza season. 

 **Insights into pandemic spread dynamics** 

 Predicting the spread of a rarer global outbreak of a deadly influenza virus \(pandemic\) is essential to informing control strategies and saving potentially millions of lives. As part of long\-term collaborations with the US, namely Bryan Grenfell now in Princeton, Lone Simonsen at the George Washington University and Cecile Viboud at the National Institutes of Health, Gog modelled the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in the US, using data from US medical insurance claims **\[R4, R5\]**. As well as giving insights into pandemic hubs and short *versus* long distance transmission events, this work highlighted the urgent need for more detailed information on the movement and mixing patterns of host populations. 

 In September 2017, a collaborative project with the BBC was launched to mark the hundredth anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic. The collaboration sought to generate such detailed data on movement that would be of general use to science and hence eventually policy, including pandemic planning in the UK. The result was a ground\-breaking citizen science project that produced the biggest ever dataset on how people mix and travel in the UK. Using this national movement data and self\-reported contact data from the BBC Pandemic App, Gog and team developed a mathematical model for the spread of influenza, and thereby simulated how a pandemic\-like strain of influenza might spread through the United Kingdom **\[R6\]**. The town of Haslemere in Surrey was used as the epicentre for the virtual outbreak \(Figure 1\). They also generated ﬁne\-scale age\-speciﬁc population contact matrices by context and type of contact that can be used to inform prevention and control measures **\[R7\]**. The experiment demonstrated among other things that with control measures in place \(e.g. hand washing\), the spread of influenza throughout the UK could be slowed down significantly.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **I1\) An essential component of a mathematical model used by the WHO to inform influenza vaccine selection, with associated global impacts on public health and the economy.** 

 Vaccination is the principal measure for preventing influenza and reducing its negative impact. Since 1973, the WHO has provided the formal recommendations for the composition of influenza vaccines based on information provided by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System \(GISRS\). Due to the evolution of influenza virus antigens, vaccine effectiveness depends critically on the accurate prediction of which variants will be dominant in the upcoming season. 

 Following extensive discussions between Gog and Professor Michael Lässig of the University of Cologne in 2011, Grenfell and Gog’s multi\-strain model **\[R1, R2, R3\]** was incorporated as the epidemiological and population dynamics component of a larger model for predicting the evolution of influenza. As Professor Lässig corroborates in **\[E1\]**, 

 *“The systematic population dynamics of multiple strains, which is at the heart of Julia’s model, proved to be the most informative fitness predictor of influenza strains… this multistrain model is a centerpiece of the mechanistic models that we are using to predict the evolution of influenza.”* 

 These mechanistic models of Łuksza and Lässig, that include Grenfell and Gog’s population model component, have been used by the WHO since 2015 to inform seasonal influenza vaccine strain selection, as the Director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre \(WIC\) confirms below **\[E2\]**. The WIC is one of six Collaborating Centres for Influenza in the WHO’s GISRS. A major role of the WHO Collaborating Centres is to advise WHO on the composition of seasonal influenza. 

 *“Predictive modelling for influenza has been transformed in recent years notably so through the work of Prof Michael Lässig and Dr Marta Łuksza \[..\] These models include as an essential component the model developed by Prof Julia Gog and Prof Bryan Grenfell initially in Cambridge on multi\-strain evolutionary models. The Lässig/Łuksza group is one of two modelling groups that have been asked by WHO for input to the WHO influenza Vaccine Composition Meetings \(VCM\) since 2015, and since 2018 a representative of the Lässig/Łuksza group have been invited to participate directly in these VCMs.\[..\]*  *It is already clear that the ability to incorporate predictive modelling into important public health decision making through improved recommendations for the composition of influenza vaccines marks a real impact”* 

 The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\) hold the most comprehensive data on influenza vaccination reach and significance. In seasons, such as 2017\-2018, when the vaccine matched most circulating strains, the influenza vaccine has been shown in recent studies to reduce the risk of influenza illness by between 40% and 60% among the overall population, highlighting the importance of accurately predicting the circulating strains. In the United States 2017\-2018 season alone, more than 155,000,000 doses of influenza vaccine were distributed and vaccination averted an estimated 6,200,000 influenza illnesses, 91,000 influenza\-associated hospitalizations, and 5,700 influenza\-associated deaths **\[E3\]**. 

 **I2\) An increase in public engagement with science, stimulating increased public awareness of the dangers of an influenza pandemic and of potential strategies to limit spread** 

 The ground\-breaking citizen science project described in the Underpinning Research section was a form of public engagement that produced impact during the research project itself.  Over 86,000 people around the UK took part in the experiment via the BBC Pandemic App, and a television programme on the project entitled “Contagion\!” The BBC Four Pandemic” was broadcast in March 2018 **\[E4\]**, generating large public interest 

 **Text removed for publication** 

 The first scientific article derived from the programme data **\[R6\]** received a record number of 718 tweets, with 66% being from the general public as of January 2020 **\[E8\]**. 

 **I3\) Informing policy via SPI\-M** 

 An influenza pandemic is viewed by the UK government as a major threat to the UK due to both its high likelihood of occurrence and severity of outcome. Gog has been recognised for her key contributions to influenza control by being invited to join the UK government working group on strategic influenza pandemic planning, namely the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling subgroup \(SPI\-M\). The Lead Analyst for Infectious Diseases in the Department of Health and Social Care \(DHSC\), confirms Gog’s key role **\[E9\]**: 

 *“During non\-pandemic periods, SPI\-M’s main role is to advise DHSC on pandemic preparedness policies. A recent example of work in this area is to use complex mathematical modelling to determine the potential impact of vaccines arriving at different times during an influenza pandemic. This will help ministers decide whether or not the UK should spend significant sums of money on a contract to develop and supply such vaccines.\[..\] As one of the UK’s leading influenza modellers, Professor Gog is a key member of the group.”*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The impact of this case study is **commercial**. University of Birmingham \(UoB\) research into a novel nonlinear semidefinite programming \(NLP\-SDP\) formulation of the nearest correlation matrix problem led to **the development of a** **new technology**, the bespoke optimisation software package PENCOR. 

 This **new technology** was **commercially adopted** by the world’s 5<sup>th</sup> largest insurance business, Allianz SE. Allianz is a **global company**, actively managing around **€764 billion in assets for its customers** and operating as an international insurer in **79 countries**. Since 2016, PENCOR has **improved the performance** of Allianz in two key ways: 

-  **Improved methods of risk assessment leading to regulatory compliance**: PENCOR is used as a critical component in ensuring compliance with the Solvency II regulatory framework, a legal requirement for continued trading for all insurers headquartered in the EU since 2016. 

-  **Significant gains in productivity and improved cost\-effectiveness**: PENCOR has avoided lost profits for Allianz of an estimated €57 million since 2016. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Our impact is underpinned by the creation of an optimisation methodology for quantifying risk that Prof. Michal Kočvara subsequently developed into a bespoke optimisation software product, PENCOR, solving a long\-standing problem in mathematical finance. The development of PENCOR and its direct relevance to the finance sector are outlined in the following four stages: 

####  **1\) <ins>Background: real\-world scenario generation in finance**</ins> 

 When making investments, financial organisations calculate the risk associated with their portfolio. A critical step in this calculation entails running a very large number of \(economic\) scenarios, which represent future states of the world. Careful scenario selection and accurate profit/loss computation is required annually by law for all insurers headquartered in the EU, as part of the Solvency II regulatory framework. 

 Crucially, constructing these scenarios requires that the correlation of thousands of risk factors is modelled in a proper and reliable way. These correlations are summarised into a very large correlation matrix. 

####  **2\) <ins>The problem: the Nearest Correlation Matrix \(NCM\) in economic prediction**</ins> 

 A correlation matrix is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix with unit diagonal. When constructing correlation matrices for economic scenario predictions, the real\-world data from which the correlations are constructed is often asynchronous or incomplete, or the models themselves may need to be stress\-tested by artificially adjusting individual correlations. These factors result in an approximate correlation matrix \(ACM\) that is unlikely to be positive semidefinite. Subsequent risk calculations using such an approximate matrix may break down altogether, for instance due to negative volatilities. As such, it is necessary from a practical standpoint to compute the nearest correlation matrix \(NCM\) to the ACM, and then use the NCM in subsequent market analyses. 

 The ACM for real\-world scenario generation is dense, usually with a dimension in the thousands. A feature of the ACM is that relatively few vectors of observations are available, and so the ACM has low rank. This usually leads to an NCM that is very poorly conditioned, i.e. the outputs from scenario generation are highly unstable, with large changes in solution resulting from small changes in inputs. This instability is highly undesirable, both from the point of view of quantifying market risk and satisfying Solvency II regulations. 

####  **3\) <ins>The solution: bypassing problems with the NCM via a Nonlinear Semidefinite Programme Formulation**</ins> 

 In order to resolve the issue of poorly conditioned NCMs, Kočvara **reformulated the NCM problem by introducing a constraint on the matrix condition number**. The resulting NCM problem is a more complicated nonlinear semidefinite problem, which can be solved via application of the body of algorithmic developments that Kočvara’s group have made in nonlinear semidefinite programming \[1\]. The resulting NCM, which has a controlled condition number, then provides very stable predictions in the risk analysis. This **key finding** represents a step\-change in semidefinite programming in financial optimisation. 

####  **4\) <ins>The application: solving NLP\-SDP with PENCOR**</ins> 

 Kočvara, Stingl \(Erlangen\) and Fiala \(UoB, Numerical Algorithms Group\) developed a mathematical algorithm and an associated software PENNON for solving linear semidefinite programming \(SDP\) problems, formulations with bilinear matrix inequalities \(BMI\), and NLP\-SDP problems. Using the key research finding — the NLP\-SDP formulation of the NCM problem \[1\] — as a basis, Kočvara led the development of a new product based on PENNON. Known as **PENCOR**, this software was developed specifically for the Group Risk Division of Allianz SE \[2\]. Kočvara provided the underpinning research, the theoretical formulation of the problem as an NLP\-SDP \[1\], while Stingl led the implementation of these problems on a multicore architecture

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The **commercial** impact of our work has three interrelated components: 1\) the **development and commercial adoption of PENCOR technology** by Allianz SE; which led to 2\) the **mitigation of potential future financial losses** for Allianz and its customers through technology\-enhanced risk assessment; and 3\) significant **gains in productivity and cost\-effectiveness** through Allianz’s ability to mitigate opportunity losses for its global customer base. 

####  **1\) <ins>Developing PENCOR, a new technology commercially adopted by Allianz SE**</ins> 

 Kočvara’s new optimisation technology embodied in PENCOR has directly resulted in the **research\-led enhancement of operations practice of the world’s 5<sup>th</sup> largest insurance business \(S4\), Allianz SE**, which operates in 79 countries \(S5\). Kočvara materially contributed to this success through Allianz’s adoption of PENCOR in 2014. 

 Allianz’s Group Risk Division approached Prof. Kočvara to work on the nearest correlation matrix problem for their Internal Risk Capital Modelling. Kočvara’s application of **a constraint on the matrix condition number** \(the **key finding** of the underpinning research\) led to the creation of PENCOR, an optimiser which is able to precisely quantify economic risk. The software offers a **much more stable solution** than the standard formulation \(S1 and S3\), providing a significant commercial advantage to Allianz. Allianz adopted the technology in 2014 as part of its strategy to ensure compliance with the EU’s Solvency II regulatory framework. 

 The regulatory framework came into effect on 1 January 2016. However, Allianz adopted the technology in advance, as it began to prepare for the introduction of the regulation once it was adopted by the European Parliament and Council of the European Union in 2009 \(S6\). Solvency II requires the quantification of all risks by every insurance company headquartered in the EU \(S2\). This entails comparing the quantified risk number to available risk capital \(a portion of total equity\), i.e. the liquid capital that needs to be available to cover investment losses. Kočvara developed PENCOR to quantify this risk and to contribute to Allianz meeting this requirement efficiently. 

 **Allianz now uses PENCOR in an early stage of the construction of economic scenarios to evaluate this market risk**, which is associated with nearly €23 billion of risk capital \(S2, p. 83\). In these scenarios, the correlation of thousands of risk factors is modelled and collated in a nearest correlation matrix, which is found via the PENCOR optimiser. This matrix is signed off by a corresponding parameter committee \(S2\) who take responsibility for the parameters inputted to the internal risk model. 

 The former Senior Risk Analyst at Allianz confirmed the importance of PENCOR to these internal preparations for regulatory compliance. It ‘is absolutely mandatory to have a stable and reliable process in place to determine the underlying correlation matrix. This is one of PENCOR’s main strengths: it is able to provide realistic, albeit stable correlation matrices, even over the course of several years, which in turn lead to rather stable risk capital numbers’ \(S3\). PENCOR has also sped up internal processes at Allianz, leading to considerable time savings: ‘the computation time of \[the\] PENCOR approach is significantly shorter than that of any benchmark processes’ \(S1\) and it ‘saves roughly 20 person days a year’ \(S3\). 

####  **2\) <ins>Enabling sustainability of Allianz into the future by improved methods of risk assessment that ensure regulatory compliance**</ins> 

 PENCOR directly contributes to regulatory compliance through advanced risk assessment. As noted above, Kočvara’s key finding of a constrained formulation of the NCM problem means that the PENCOR optimiser ‘is superior to benchmark approaches’ \(S1\), producing a much more stable solution than the standard formulation \(S3\). This stability of the NCM results in stable risk capital numbers over longer time\-frames. This is important because it means that Allianz needs fewer liquid assets to meet regulatory requirements. PENCOR ensures the stability of risk capital parameters, which are key to **driving down the amount of risk capital that Allianz is required to hold as a buffer**. The required amount of risk capital in the Solvency II framework is called the Solvency Capital Requirement \(SCR\). 

 If the insurer’s available resources fall below its SCR, then supervisors are required to take action to restore the insurer’s finances to the level of the SCR. If this is not done, the level of supervisory intervention is progressively intensified. Ultimately, if the available resources of the insurer fall below the Minimum Capital Requirement \(MCR\), then the insurer’s liabilities are transferred to another insurer, and the license of the insurer is withdrawn, or the business is liquidated \(S7\). 

 Compliance with Solvency II was considered difficult, with the implementation date postponed several times \(S6\). By forming a critical part of the internal risk calculation for Pillar 1 of Solvency II, **PENCOR has helped** **Allianz meet this challenging regulatory requirement**. Such regulatory compliance ensures that Allianz’s global trading can continue unimpeded. 

####  <ins> **3\) Delivering significant gains in productivity and improved cost\-effectiveness, saving Allianz an estimated</ins> <ins>€</ins><ins>57 million in opportunity losses since 2016**</ins> 

 By reformulating the nearest correlation matrix problem as an NLP\-SDP with a matrix condition number constraint, optimisation with the new technology PENCOR has improved Allianz’s risk number calculation by making it much more stable. This has resulted in significant productivity gains. The nearest correlation matrix is one risk capital parameter among many: others include volatilities, exposure, mitigating measures. According to a former Senior Risk Analyst from the Risk Methodology Group at Allianz \(the team that laid the methodological foundation for their current internal risk capital model\), a stable calculation of the nearest correlation matrix decreases the value of the risk capital typically by around 0.5% \(range from 0.1%–5%, depending on market conditions; S3\). 

 The risk capital for market risk of Allianz is currently around €23 billion \(S2, p. 83\). As such, the 0.5% improvement in performance that PENCOR drives by stable construction of the nearest correlation matrix equates to a decrease in the risk capital of around **€115 million each year since the beginning of 2016**. PENCOR has therefore freed up an estimated total of 5 x €115 million = **€575 million for investment** this impact period. 

 Since risk capital cannot provide any return on investment, the use of PENCOR has therefore **mitigated opportunity losses** for Allianz, and the global customers for which it manages assets, of around **€11.5 million each year since 2016** \(assuming a realistic yield differential of 10% between risk\-free rate and return on equity; S3\). 

 Thus, PENCOR has provided **significant gains in productivity** to Allianz by mitigating an estimated total of 5 x €11.5 million ≈ **€57 million** opportunity losses for Allianz and their global customer base in the current impact period.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

  

 Research by Dr Doldor and Dr Atewologun has shaped national policy on women on boards \(WoB\) and sectoral practice on ethnic diversity in senior leadership in UK businesses. Following an investigation of women’s under\-representation on FTSE 350 boards and interventions, their work has resulted in the widespread adoption of voluntary gender targets for boards  and has increased gender balance on them as a result. Consequently, Doldor’s reports have influenced national policies concerning women leaders, including the UK government and FTSE\-endorsed Davies and Hampton\-Alexander reviews. In turn, following their examination of ethnic diversity in leadership within a ‘Big 4’ professional services firm \(EY\), Doldor and Atewologun’s research has informed more inclusive leadership development practices within the company \(including increased engagement and retention for 100\+ ethnic minority leaders\) and across the wider professional services sector. As a result of this work. EY has developed new pipelines of board talent. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning this case examined the causes and proposed corrective interventions for the under\-representation of women and ethnic minorities on boards and in senior leadership. 

#  Gender diversity on boards and in senior leadership 

 In 2015 Doldor co\-authored the official annual UK census of women on FTSE 350 boards \(Female FTSE Report \- FFR\) \[5.1\]. Significantly, this featured a quantitative index \(derived from secondary data\), monitoring board composition \(by gender, size, director role, age, experience, nationality\), and qualitative studies \(primary data harnessed from 75 interviews and five case studies\), investigating the change factors \(CEOs, Chairmen, policy\-makers, diversity experts\), policies and organisational practices promoted by national WoB reviews. These included those by Davies between 2011 and 2015 \[5.5\], and by Hampton\-Alexander from 2016 to 2020 \[5.6\].  Doldor’s research was collaboratively produced with Vinnicombe \(Cranfield\) and Sealy \(Exeter\), although she led the qualitative studies in key reports \[5.1\-5.3\] on inclusive talent management, voluntary gender targets \[3.5, 5.2\], and directors’ leadership trajectories \[5.3\]. Her ensuing research critically examined the possibilities and limits of voluntary strategies for gender equality on boards promoted by national reviews \[3.2\]. Other studies \(with Wyatt and Silvester\) examined gender bias in leadership development practices below boards \[3.1\]. Three key findings emerged from the integrated analysis of firm\-level gender trends, organizational practices and national policies: 

1.  UK’s ‘business\-led voluntary approach’ such as threat of mandatory quotas and ‘soft quotas’ \(the Davies Reviews recommended a voluntary gender target of 25% WoB\) is ineffective without institutional pressure. Internal organizational gender targets below board\-level also provide a disciplined approach to correcting gender bias in talent management processes \[3.2\]. 

1.  Institutional change for WoB is shaped jointly by multiple stakeholders, including academics who enable the collective gestation of ideas reframing explanations for lack of WoB, from an assumed lack of qualified women, to biased board selection processes \[3.3\]; and head\-hunters who make board selection more gender inclusive by responding opportunistically to change driven by committed actors \(such as those identified by the Davies reviews\) \[3.4\]. 

1.  The lack of women in executive roles below boards is an enduring challenge \[3.2\]; biased leadership development processes account for the gender gap in leadership \[3.1\]. 

  

#  Ethnic diversity in senior leadership 

 Based on their recognised expertise in diversity and leadership, Doldor and Atewologun \(with Wyatt\) were commissioned by EY to examine the under\-representation of BAME individuals in Partnership \(the most senior leadership role in professional services firms\). A mix\-method study \(involving interviews with 55 White, Asian and Black male and female consultants; interviews and focus groups with 18 Partners, HR professionals, Senior Managers and Directors; and analysis of 10\-year HR data of 3,500 employees\) examined career progression to Partnership in the firm \[3.6\]. Findings demonstrated that: 

1.  The journey to Partnership entails a leadership identity shift from ‘individual technical expert’, to ‘relationship manager’ and to ‘emerging Partner’, a process enabled by established Partners through socialisation and gate\-keeping processes. 

1.  Different career capitals \(knowing how, knowing whom and knowing why\) are essential for success at different career stages. Ethnicity, gender and social class shape access to acquisition and transformation of different career capitals, hindering leadership progression. There is limited ability to articulate the impact of race on the accumulation of career capitals \(‘race fluency’\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

#  Shaping national policy on women on boards and in leadership 

 Doldor’s research has been frequently cited in key reviews of women on boards and in leadership roles by Davies \(2011\-2015\) \[5.6\] and Hampton\-Alexander \(2015\-2020\) \[5.5\]. The reviews instigated transformative national\-level policies by requiring UK FTSE 350 companies to adopt voluntary gender targets, substantially improving gender balance in corporate leadership. From 2013\-2020, across FTSE100, the share of women on boards \(WoB\) increased from 17.3% to 34.5% \(increase prior to Davies was from 11% to 15% between 2007 and 2012\). Across FTSE 350, 350\+ new female directors were appointed, and all\-male boards dropped from 74 to 1. 

 Research by Doldor and co\-authors shaped these policies by providing insights into senior women’s career obstacles and by supporting the case for voluntary gender targets on boards and below. National policymakers promoting these reviews endorsed Doldor’s research, evidenced by the reports’ forewords from Government Equalities Office and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills ministers \(Maria Miller, Vince Cable, Nicky Morgan and Lucy Neville\-Rolfe\). The research \[3.5, 5.1\] was cited in all of the Davies reports \(2013\-2015\) and was regularly shared with the members of the Davies Committee \(of which co\-author Vinnicombe was member\). Doldor led several qualitative studies within the FFRs that cemented the case for targets: 

-  2014 on inclusive talent management \[3.5, p.32\-44\]: evidenced metrics and targets as effective practice to increase gender balance across organizational ranks. 

-  2015 on national change actors in the field \[5.1, p.34\-48\]: underscored the importance of targets and ongoing challenges for women below boards. Consequently, the closing 2015 Davies Report noted that despite substantive progress for WoB, future policy should focus on targets for women executives below boards. 

-  2016 and 2020 \[5.2, p.43\-59 and p.26\-43 respectively\]: examined challenges and opportunities when using voluntary targets on boards and below. Sir Philip Hampton, Chairman of the Hampton\-Alexander review \(which replaced those conducted earlier by Davies\), was guest speaker at the 2016 and 2020 report launches, concurring with the reports’ suggestions. 

 In 2016, Doldor was invited to provide advisory input into Hampton\-Alexander consultations and subsequently feedback on the review’s initial report before publication \[5.5\], shaping recommendations 1 and 2 of the review. The Deputy Director, Government Equalities Office, testified: 

 ‘Dr Doldor has provided advice to organizations and policy\-makers, helping to influence policy on this issue’; her work ‘has informed national\-level recommendations made by the Hampton\-Alexander Review in November 2016 \(the review advised that FTSE companies adopt voluntary gender targets on boards and at Executive Committee level\). Dr Doldor was one of the few academics invited to contribute to a roundtable consultation held by the Hampton\-Alexander Review.’ \[5.4\] 

 The 2016 Hampton\-Alexander Review set more ambitious targets for WoB \(33%, compared to the 25% Davies target\) and introduced targets of 33% for women below boards \(on Executive Committees\) by 2020 **.** The review also underscored the importance of inclusive headhunting practices, as investigated by Doldor \[3.4\]. The closing 2020 Hampton\-Alexander Review report \(published Feb 2021 due to COVID delays\) featured input from Doldor on the importance of targets \(p. 12\) the only academic quoted in the report \[5.5\]. 

 Doldor’s research is also used by employers seeking to achieve gender balance leadership pipelines. She was invited \(2018\-2019\) to provide input at Government Equalities Office policy events and into their ‘Women’s Progression in the Workplace’ employer toolkit \[5.7\]; and to host a webinar attended by 177 employers, 53% of whom stated that they are likely to change their diversity practices based on Doldor’s research insights \[3.1; 3.5; 5.3\]. Doldor and co\-authors \(Wyatt and Silvester\) are developing their research \[3.1\] into a practitioner toolkit for female leadership development through unbiased feedback. Seven employers signed up to pilot the toolkit in 2020. Doldor was invited by the Chartered Management Institute \(2020\) to share research on voluntary targets during an online event attended by 300\+ managers. This activity demonstrates sustainability of impact. 

 Doldor’s research informed public debate on gender equality through media coverage \(CNN, BBC, BBC Radio Four, The FT, The Guardian, HR Magazine\) \[5.8\], and invited advisory roles \(European Parliament 2013; Professional Women’s Network Romania 2015; Harvard Business School 2016\). 

#  Shaping organizational & sectoral practice on ethnic diversity in senior leadership 

 The above\-mentioned national policies promoting diversity targets shaped how leading professional services firms nurture diversity in their leadership \(a pipeline of FTSE board candidates\). Doldor and Atewologun \(with Wyatt\) investigated gender and ethnicity in career trajectories at EY, a world\-leading professional services. Their research \[3.6\] informed tools used by HR and Partners and three major initiatives on diversity in leadership within EY \[5.9\]: 

-  *Future Leaders’ Programme* targets the ‘knowing whom’ and ‘why’ research findings. Aspiring, high potential BAME leaders felt that the programme enabled career development \(90%\) and developed effective leadership skills \(87% vs 70% at baseline\), career\-enhancing positive political skills \(80% vs 49% baseline\), and self\-awareness \(100% vs 81% at baseline\). 

-  *Allies Workshops* addresses limited ‘race fluency’ identified by the research, with non\-BAME staff pivotal in making the culture more inclusive. Allies found the programme useful \(94%\) and became more confident about tackling race at work \(64% vs 50% at baseline\): ‘I am better prepared to talk about race more openly’. 

-  *Career Watch* pairs BAME managers with Partners who become sponsors, addressing the ‘knowing\-whom’ research findings. The programme won the 2018 Employers’ Network for Equality and Inclusion ‘Tapping into Talent’ award for ‘demonstrable impact on retention, promotion and performance of our high potential diverse future leaders’. 

 As a result, the equalities campaign group Race for Opportunity named EY a top 10 organisation for their approach to ethnic diversity. EY are rolling out these diversity practices with clients \(e.g. UK government, the financial sector\): ‘We have found the dual approach from this research, that targets action for the minority and broader cultural change for the majority has been highly effective. So much so that we are sharing our experience with our clients.’ \(Diversity & Inclusion Manager, EY\) \[5.9\]. The research \[3.6\] was used as evidence by the national Parker Review who recommended voluntary ethnicity targets for FTSE 350 boards \[5.10\]; Atewologun was academic advisor on the review. EY itself adopted voluntary targets for Partnership representation \(40% women and 20% BAME by 2025\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Warwick’s research into patient and public involvement \(PPI\) has contributed to changing the way in which healthcare is researched, evaluated and improved. It has embedded the patient perspective into the development of health and social care systems, both in the UK and internationally. Research by Professor Sophie Staniszewska and colleagues from Warwick Medical School has directly shaped more than 75 NICE guidance documents, including the first national and international clinical guidelines on patient experience. Through collaboration with policy organisations, care providers, and global research organisations, the work has placed patient experience at the centre of policy\-making and best practice guidance. The researchers have created new opportunities, which enable patients and the public to have a voice in the creation and dissemination of healthcare knowledge. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the past 20 years, policy organisations, care providers, and national and international research organisations have placed increasing emphasis on understanding and valuing patient experience and strengthening patient and public involvement in research. Between 2007 and 2020 researchers at the University of Warwick played a key role in the development of two interconnected streams of highly significant work that have transformed understanding of and influenced national and international strategy on patient experience and involvement: 

 **a. Patient experience** 

 Less than a decade ago, patient experience was not necessarily viewed as a key concept in the health\-practice evidence base and there was no agreed evidence\-based patient experience framework to inform the development of national policy and practice. 

 <ins>Warwick Patient Experi</ins><ins>e</ins><ins>nce Framework \(WaPEF\):</ins> In 2012, Professors Staniszewska and Seers were commissioned by the Royal College of Physicians Clinical Guideline Centre to develop a unified, evidence\-based framework using the concept of patient\-based evidence to complement clinical and economic forms of evidence \[3.1\]. WaPEF is recognised as the underpinning framework for NICE guidance. 

 <ins> **Patient\-reported outcomes \(PROMS\)</ins><ins>:</ins> <ins></ins>In** October 2013, Dr Kirstie Haywood explored the potential for patient engagement in health\-related quality of life \(HRQL\) and patient\-reported outcomes \(PROMS\) research at an International Society for Quality of Life research \(ISOQOL\) symposium. The discussions recognised the need to involve patients in co\-production of PROMS and to develop a framework or toolkit of how to embed patient experience \(PE\) within HRQL and PROMS research. 

 **b. Patient and Public Involvement \(PPI\)** 

 Staniszewska’s research has underpinned the development of the international PPI evidence base, which was previously fragmented and poorly theorised, with limited understanding of PPI impact. To generate an evidence base for policy and practice \[3.2\], studies looked at: 

 <ins>H</ins><ins>ow PPI works:</ins> Drawing together evidence to understand its conceptualisation, definition, impact, measurement and outcomes \[3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5\] Staniszewska’s research generated an understanding of how PPI works \[3.2, 3.5\]; she and colleagues used their findings to develop deeper insights into what is effective PPI within healthcare organisations, and to understand the role and experiences of patients. For example, our systematic reviews have identified a range of impacts PPI can have on research including enhancing the quality of research and the way in which individuals and communities feel valued \[3.3,3.4\]. 

 <ins>What to report about PPI:</ins> Staniszewska and Seers identified the key challenge of poor\-quality PPI reporting and developed internationally recognised EQUATOR guidance, GRIPP2 \(an update of GRIPP \- Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public\). GRIPP2 is the first international evidence\-based guidance to enhance the quality of PPI reporting and strengthen the PPI evidence base by creating transparency in the ways in which the public are involved in research \[3.6\]. 

 <ins>How</ins> <ins>to enhance PPI:</ins> As Vice\-chair of the NIHR PPI policy review, Staniszewska worked with colleagues in NIHR to identify the importance of co\-production and contributed to NIHR guidance on co\-production \[3.2\] and a collection of examples for practice. She led on the implementation of a co\-production model of publishing to underpin the journal ‘Research Involvement and Engagement’ and worked with the BMJ to generate an understanding of how patients and the public experienced this way of working in publishing. 

 <ins>How to support global PPI practice:</ins> Warwick’s active international role has provided the foundation for understanding how PPI operates across health care systems, and how HTA agencies engage with patients. Building on her decade of shaping public involvement in HTA, Staniszewska is co\-editor of the first special issue of the International Journal for Technology Assessment in Healthcare with 24 papers on public involvement, due for publication in February 2021. Early papers include the importance of co\-production in NICE. Patient and community representatives have been supported to publish as lead or co\-authors.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact on policy and practice in the UK: measured improvements in patient experience** 

 Staniszewska has been a member of the NICE Expert Panel \(since 2018\), the NICE Implementation Strategy Group \(since 2018\), the NICE Guidelines Centre Expert Panel \(since 2019\) and the NICE Implementation strategy group \(since 2019\). She was the invited topic advisor for the development of the Social Care Institute for Excellence guidance on a good experience of social care \(SCIE 2018\). 

 <ins>N</ins><ins>ICE</ins> <ins>Guidance:</ins> Staniszewska and Seers’ were commissioned by the Royal College of Physicians Clinical Guideline Centre to develop a high quality evidence\-based Warwick Patient Experiences Framework \(WaPEF\). This informed the first national and international clinical guideline on patient experience, ‘NICE patient experience in adult NHS services: improving the experience of care for people using adult NHS services clinical guideline’ \[CG138\] \(February 2012, updated October 2015 and February 2020\) and the ‘NICE patient experience in adult NHS services’ Quality Standard \[QS15\] \(February 2012, updated July 2019\) \[5.1\]. The guidance is aimed at clinical and non\-clinical staff, commissioners, providers and patients, and focuses on components of good patient experiences, setting out indicators of high\-quality, cost\-effective care. 

 <ins>NHS England:</ins> Staniszewska was subsequently invited to join the National Quality Board Patient Experiences Group to inform an integrated national strategy developed by NHS England to align key agencies. NHS England National Director for Patient Experience, Neil Churchill, states: ""\[Warwick’s\] research has created a high\-quality evidence base which now underpins our national approach to improving care experiences and has made a vital contribution to creating evidence\-based policy"" \[5.2\]. WaPEF underpinned the NHS England statement ‘ [Improving experiences of care: Our shared understanding and ambition](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20161103235253/https:/www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/improving-experiences-of-care.pdf)’ to which 15 agencies signed up to the policy position from 2015, including the Department of Health, NHS England and Care Quality Commission. 

 <ins>Monitoring uptake of CG138 and QS15:</ins> This is routinely carried out by the Quality Health National Cancer Patient Experience Survey, Care Quality Commission National Inpatient Survey, Care Quality Commission Emergency Department Survey, NHS England GP Patient Survey, NHS Digital National Diabetes Inpatient Audit, and Royal College of Psychiatrists National Audit of Dementia. CG138 is directly referenced in 76 current NICE Guidelines, typically within a patient\-centred care section stating: *“NICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS services. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in patient experience in adult NHS services.”* They set out considerations regarding: communication and support; providing information/ sharing with patients, family and carers; shared decision\-making; treating patients as individuals; and continuity of care. A wide range of conditions and procedures are covered, such as: 

-  Routine preoperative tests for elective surgery NICE guideline \[NG45\], with 10,100,000 operations completed by the NHS \(NHS Digital, Hospital Admitted Patient Care Activity, 2015\-16\) 

-  Type 2 diabetes in adults: management NICE guideline \[NG28\], with over 3,400,000 adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 201.9 \(Diabetes.org.uk\) 

 <ins>Learning examples:</ins> The NICE Local Practice Collection published seven shared learning examples between August 2013 and July 2019 about how NICE guidance on patient experience has been implemented by local health and social care services. Common themes include: increased positive feedback from patients; increased, standardised or improved training for staff; cost savings for the NHS; reductions in re\-referrals; patients feeling empowered by being involved in their own care and decision\-making; patients being given the right information; patients being provided with continuity and well\-coordinated care; and a decrease in complaints. For example, in 2018 Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust used Quality Improvement tools to improve understanding of patient experience and the quality of the acute non\-invasive ventilation \(NIV\) service for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. This demonstrated that *“Thematic analysis of patient experience feedback has improved from 16% positive responses to 56% in the last year. This includes positive comments on communication, information provision and decision\-making”* \[5.3\]. In 2013\-2014, Dorset County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust used CG158 and QS15 to provide a neutral structure to categorise and theme complaints thereby identify areas of poor practice. Following implementation and staff training, *“the total number of complaints escalated to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman in 2013/14 was 1, this was an 87.5% \(n=8\) decrease on the previous year”* \[5.3\]. 

 **Impact on policy, practice and public opinion:** **normalising PPI in research** 

 <ins>International connection and debate:</ins> In 2018 Staniszewska collaborated with NIHR, Cochrane, INVOLVE and COMET \(Core Outcomes Measures in Effectiveness Trials\) to launch the International PPI Network, a social movement with over 240 member organisations and individuals representing patients, the public, researchers, clinicians and policymakers \[5.4\]. Since then, an online international seminar programme has covered a wide range of topics for patients and publics. Between August 2019 and June 2020 there have been 10 webinars with 823 attendees and 3,254 views on PPI in research. Staniszewska was a member of the Steering Group and co\-chair of the Methods and Impact subgroup of the Health Technology Assessment International \(HTAi\) Patient and Citizen Involvement Special Interest Group until June 2019. With members in 65 countries, HTAi has produced a range of resources to support public voice in HTA. 

 <ins> **N</ins><ins>ational and international</ins> <ins>strategic policy in health research</ins><ins>:**</ins> In 2015, with Staniszewska as Vice\-Chair, the NIHR Breaking Boundaries Policy Review assessed progress in public involvement and develop a vision and mission for 2025. The Policy Report ‘Going the extra mile’ \(NIHR 2015\) and paper \(Staniszewska et al, 2018\) provides clear strategy and direction for NIHR, including implementation of co\-production, which Staniszewska supported in development \[5.5\]. She was also part of the NIHR National Strategy Group which was reviewing PPI impact, and is now part of the newly formed NIHR Global Health PPI Advisory Group, in addition to informing the development of the NIHR Values Framework. 

 Staniszewska was an invited member of the international team developing open science and public involvement metrics on behalf of the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2018. A toolkit was developed to measure the implementation and impact of open science partnership for use by government and philanthropic grantors and community organisations \[5.6\]. Staniszewska advised colleagues and policymakers in Canada who were developing strategic PPI policy, as part of an invited international summit she attended with the NIHR National Director of PPI, and she chaired the award of Health Research Board of Ireland 2020 infrastructure funding for public involvement. 

 <ins> **T</ins><ins>he public voice in research</ins> <ins>publishing</ins><ins>:**</ins> In 2015 Staniszewska established a new journal, Research Involvement and Engagement \(RIE\), which aims to develop the evidence base of PPI. This unique co\-production model has grown exponentially, from 26,902 article accesses in its first year to over 170,025 in 2020. The Journal Development Manager at BMC, states: “Other journals published by BMC and Springer Nature are drawing on Research Involvement and Engagement to strengthen patient involvement in the publishing process. Since launch, the Journal has gone from strength to strength with 2020 becoming our most successful year for publications” \[5.7\]. “The journal has achieved ‘Patient Included’ status and indexing in Scopus, who upon acceptance stated: ‘This is a very innovative journal on many counts, the involvement of service users/patients in all aspects of the journal content as well as the open review for accepted papers’” \[5.7\]. 

 The co\-production approach enables patients and the public to shape published research, with researchers encouraged to work with patients as collaborators, to include patients as co\-authors and to write a mandatory plain English summary \[5.8\]. The editors have developed a pool of patient peer reviewers \(n=289\) and, in collaboration with the BMJ, surveyed the patient experience of peer review in order to improve their experience. Their approach to co\-production is underpinned by the NIHR guidance \[5.9\] that was co\-authored by Staniszewska. 

 The journal is co\-edited by patient advocate Richard Stephens, who is a survivor of two cancers and a heart emergency and has participated in four clinical trials. He first became involved in patient advocacy in 1998 when, as a newly diagnosed cancer patient, he misunderstood information about a randomised trial given to him in a patient information sheet. *“My own misunderstanding made me wonder why patients weren’t involved in writing the information that would be given to other patients. Back then, hospitals wrote their own patient information sheets. Now they are written by the research team, usually involving at least one patient as good practice.* 

 *“Patients should not only be at the centre of trial design, we should be present throughout the whole research process. In the UK, we are ahead of any other country in the world in this regard. We still have lots of gaps to fill but Professor Staniszewska’s work has made an important contribution to the progress that has been made to give patients a voice in the design of their own healthcare.’’* \[5.7\].

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research led by Dr Joeri Rogelj of Imperial College London has addressed key knowledge gaps at the climate science\-policy interface. Climate change mitigation research over the past decade has looked at strategies for limiting global warming to levels considered safe by society, a question often explored with models that integrate knowledge across the engineering, economic, agricultural and physical sciences. 

 Rogelj pioneered the exploration of detailed societal transformation pathways towards limiting warming to 1.5°C. This work provided the only study of its kind in time to inform the negotiations on the 2015 Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\). He led an international consortium of six integrated assessment modelling teams to show how society’s ability to limit warming to 1.5°C critically depends on specific socioeconomic drivers \(in the literature described as “Shared Socioeconomic Pathways”\). This climate change research has continued with several publications that contribute important, novel perspectives on how the Paris Agreement can be implemented. 

 Rogelj’s Imperial work, published in 2018, showed how increased energy services can be provided to poor and vulnerable populations while reducing overall global energy demand and achieving sustainable development goals through a transformation to a highly efficient society **\[1\]**. An additional influential 2019 study highlighted the inherent biases of dominant approaches used to design climate change scenarios. Rogelj’s work identified those strategies that result in high climate risk and engrained intergenerational unfairness. He then presented solutions by focussing on net\-zero targets instead **\[2\]**. 

 More recent work by Rogelj and colleagues on societal transformation scenarios culminated in the design, development, and open\-source publication of a vetted climate scenario database **\[3\]**. This now serves as a key community resource, enabling re\-use and further investigation of societal transformation pathways by academics and government analysts. This research provides, inter alia, the evidence underpinning key characteristics of 1.5°C\-consistent pathways, including the need to reach net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by mid\-century. 

 This research on societal transformations for ambitious climate goals is complemented by research on methods to analyse the implications of the current gap between countries’ pledges and pathways that limit global warming to the levels agreed upon in the UN Paris Agreement **\[4\]**. For example, Rogelj’s research highlighted the woeful inadequacy of progress towards climate protection over the past 10 years and demonstrated that more ambitious climate pledges, combined with early and aggressive action, are now imperative to ensure a safe future climate. 

 Finally, Rogelj and colleagues established a comprehensive framework for estimating and tracking the remaining carbon budget, that is, the total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can ever be emitted while keeping global warming below specific temperature limits **\[5\]**. This framework resolved key misunderstandings and provided clarity to policy makers about how some of their policy choices influence the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can still be emitted while keeping warming to levels consistent with the UN Paris Agreement.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Global warming, driven by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, poses severe risks for natural and human systems. Average global temperatures have already risen to approximately 1.0°C above pre\-industrial levels as a result of human activities **\[A\]** and a science\-policy consensus has emerged, enshrined in the Paris Agreement, which seeks to limit warming to well below 2.0°C, and ideally to 1.5°C. 

 Before Rogelj’s research, policy\-makers faced two significant obstacles: 

-  It was unclear whether and how the 1.5°C limit might be achieved. While numerous groups publish scenarios, none offered a clear way forward to keep warming below the 1.5°C limit. Moreover, the scenarios were risky, permitting the 1.5°C limit to be exceeded \(as long as temperatures returned to 1.5°C by 2100\) and unfair, placing the greatest burdens on later generations. 

-  There was also disagreement and misunderstanding about the size of the world’s remaining carbon budget, the total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can still be emitted while keeping global warming below the 1.5°C limit. A robust and up\-to\-date carbon budget estimate was critical to informing climate policies, and tracking performance, but a wide range of conflicting estimates hindered progress. 

 Rogelj successfully addressed both challenges, by detailing new societal transformation pathways that could limit warming to 1.5°C without exceeding the target or requiring intergenerational unfairness **\[1, 2, 3\]**, and by establishing a comprehensive, transparent framework for estimating and tracking the carbon budget **\[5\]**. He also developed methods **\[4\]** to assess the gap between the global warming outcomes likely to result from national climate pledges and the temperature limits established in the Paris Agreement. 

 As a result, Rogelj’s ground\-breaking work has: 

1.  **Transformed science\-policy assessments at the international level** 

1.  **Driven ambitious policy decisions at the national level** 

1.  **Broadened wider societal awareness and engagement in climate change** 

 **International impacts** 

 Rogelj’s research provided a critical evidence base for the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C \(SR1.5\), a landmark report published in October 2018 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) **\[A\]**. More than 15 of Rogelj’s papers were referenced in the SR1.5. Importantly, all four of the central illustrative pathways used by the report to communicate strategic mitigation choices to policymakers are from studies led or co\-authored by Rogelj. Indeed, Chapter 2 of the SR1.5 directly referenced Rogelj’s work **\[1\]** when describing these pathways \(page 110\), as well as applying Rogelj’s framework for estimating remaining carbon budget **\[5\]** for the first time \(pages 104\-8\). The SR1.5 concludes, again directly based on Rogelj’s research, **\[3\]** that pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C halve global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2030 compared to 2010 and reach net zero CO<sub>2</sub> around mid\-century – insights that have had a fundamental impact on national policy. 

 Rogelj’s research **\[1, 3, 4\]** also directly underpins the Emissions Gap Report \(EGR\) **\[B\]**, published annually by the UN Environment Programme \(UNEP\). The EGR estimates how much warming could be expected should countries’ pledges on greenhouse gas emissions\-cutting be implemented, and how temperatures would diverge from the limits set out in the Paris Agreement. The Head of Thematic Scientific Assessments at UNEP, confirms that *“the novel methods Joeri Rogelj published to assess the gap between countries’ climate pledges and their global warming outcome have become the \[EGR’s\] scientific and analytical backbone.”* **\[C\]**. The EGR and \- by extension, Rogelj’s work \- is of critical importance in international climate policy circles. Referencing the opening session of Conference of the Parties \(COP 25\), the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference held in Madrid, they note that **“** *3 out of 5 speakers … made direct use of EGR messages in their speech. The same was the case for the UN Secretary General in his separate address…”* **\[C\]**. The EGR findings were referred to in Decisions 1/CMA.2 and 1/CP.25 of COP25, adopted by all 197 countries of the UNFCCC. 

 **National impacts** 

 Rogelj’s research, and the authoritative science\-policy assessments it informs, has also directly influenced significant national policy change. The publication of the IPCC SR1.5 **\[A\]** prompted the UK, Scottish and Welsh Governments to ask the UK Committee on Climate Change \(CCC\) to assess its implications for the UK’s long\-term climate target and net zero greenhouse gas date **\[D\]**. The resulting Net Zero Report **\[E\]**, published by CCC in May 2019, cites Rogelj’s research database **\[3\]** as evidencing four of the six diagrams in Chapter 2, and for all quantitative tables in both Chapter 2 and 3. Insights from Rogelj’s research activities for the UNEP EGR **\[B\]** are also cited in the Net Zero Report’s context setting and analysis. The UK CCC corroborates Rogelj’s contribution: *“Research outputs of Dr Rogelj played a critical role in shaping the evidence base for the SR1.5 and subsequently informing the CCC advice to Government* **” \[F\]**. The CCC Net Zero Report directly led to the UK’s adoption in June 2019 of an ambitious net zero greenhouse gas emissions target as a legally binding national long\-term climate goal. The new law **\[G\]** explicitly references both the conclusions of the IPCC SR1.5 **\[A\]** and the advice provided by the CCC **\[E\]**. 

 Similarly, Rogelj’s research on 1.5°C\-consistent pathways, included in the IPCC SR1.5, is cited in the First Annual Report of the High Council on Climate of France **\[H\]**, leading in June 2019 to France setting a national carbon neutrality target in legislation, and referenced as key scientific evidence in the EU’s draft proposal for a European Climate Law **\[I\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The research of Erika Hughes and Matt Smith has a shared focus on the transformative effects of applied theatre practices. It has produced new modes and opportunities for engagement, participation and learning for individuals and institutions in the UK and internationally. New audiences, including underserved communities and vulnerable groups, have been attracted and involved through collaborative community engagement projects which have led to changed museum and festival practices and new approaches to community outreach. International initiatives have supported military veterans in the UK and US with mental wellbeing and better public understanding through theatricalized storytelling. Most recently, their work has been instrumental in reaching and educating communities in Kenya on urgent health issues, supporting the understanding of children’s experiences of lung problems and air pollution, and helping to prevent the spread and transmission of Covid\-19. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The complementary research methodologies of Hughes and Smith, involving community\-based theatre making, have created new modes of engagement for organisations while providing a vital means of expression for individuals and groups. Their research investigates how Applied Theatre can help communities grapple with difficult topics like immigration, asylum, trauma, and military conflict. Smith’s work in applied puppetry and Hughes’ work in transformative storytelling explore opportunities for engagement in schools, community centres, festivals, and museums. Both scholars share an approach to opening dialogues among communities and groups, and have consolidated the culture of Applied Theatre at the University of Portsmouth. 

 Smith’s research is informed by twenty\-seven years of using puppetry in applied theatre settings. This practice formed the bedrock for theorising a new field: ‘applied puppetry’, a term that Smith coined in a 2014 chapter and subsequently developed in further publications of 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2020 \( **R1**\). Smith’s research conceptualises puppetry as a tool for the \(re\)conceiving of identities, which is especially evident in practices and performances he has conducted with marginalised groups such as migrants \(2016\) and disabled people \(2020\). Smith’s research expounds a haptic practice\-led methodology for using puppets as an applied form of theatre making. This methodology involves a form of creative dialogue supported by puppetry, in which participants describe narratives about geographies, ecologies and heritage and thereby reconceive the world through practice \(2020\). He reveals the powerful impact of applied puppetry on individuals and groups, identifying potential for new modes of participation, expression and experience \(2015\). This approach to practice is evident in the *Puppet City* project. 

 Hughes’ published research has considered how Applied Theatre can serve as a tool through which communities can come to terms with their pasts. It is also informed by extensive experience as a theatre director and deviser of live performance concerning the Holocaust in non\-traditional settings. In articles of 2017 and 2018, Hughes considered dramaturgical strategies for children’s theatre in Phoenix, Arizona, **\(R2\)** and in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC **\(R3\)**. Her practice\-research has since increasingly dealt with legacies of conflict and trauma for military veterans. 

 ‘Embodied historiography’, the practice\-research methodology Hughes first described in a 2014 article, is both a concept and a method for applied theatre work. It conceives of community performers as living historical documents and places audience members in the role of historians. This performance dynamic enables standard narratives around the Holocaust, youth and military service to be challenged through storytelling performance and it thereby transforms understandings for performers and audiences. 

 Since joining the University of Portsmouth in 2017, Hughes has further deployed and developed this method in an ongoing series of performance\-based practice\-research projects \(six since joining Portsmouth\) with military veterans that have been conducted in the UK and US. In a 2017 article **\(R4\)**, Hughes theorised that the acts of performing and witnessing produced by the projects are central to the process of gathering, generating and exchanging knowledge. In each performance, veterans from the UK or US share their experiences of military service with one another, and their communities, which transform understandings of military life and service for veterans \(performers\) and civilians \(audience\). 

 In 2019, Smith collaborated on the Medical Research Council funded ‘Tupumue’ project, *‘Non\-communicable lung disease in Kenya: from burden and early life determinants to participatory interdisciplinary solutions’*. The project explored children’s experiences of lung problems and air pollution to demonstrate the high prevalence of non\-communicable lung disease. Led by Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, the cross\-disciplinary team included Cressida Bowyer \(Senior Research Fellow and Principal Investigator\) who led on the identification of relevant applied creative methods from the University of Portsmouth. Portsmouth co\-investigator, Louis Netter \(Senior Lecturer in Illustration\) worked with Smith to develop puppetry as an innovative route to engage Kenyan communities with health issues **\(S5\)**. The puppetry was engaged to enhance the project’s aims to communicate public health information and familiarise communities with the project, which was further supported by a Wellcome Trust public engagement award in collaboration with the University of Glasgow **\(S10\)**. 

 In 2020, the success of the ‘Tupumue’ project led to Smith and Hughes collaborating with UoP colleague Netter as practice\-researchers on the *ACT \(Action against COVID Transmission\)* project to support the Mukuru community in Nairobi in reducing COVID\-19 transmission. Led by University of Portsmouth PI, Bowyer, it included a cross\-disciplinary team of academics and partner organisations in the UK and Kenya. The project developed creative methods for responding to the COVID\-19 crisis and to raise awareness around health and wellbeing issues. It disseminated public health messages using socially and culturally relevant media. Smith’s work in applied puppetry and Hughes’ research in transformative storytelling were instrumental in developing a practical toolkit to support workshop\-leaders of the Mukuru Arts Centre to engage and educate local communities about the risks and dangers of COVID\-19. The ACT project deployed a selection of creative methods, including puppetry and transformative storytelling, for a period of 4 months.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The innovative research methodologies of Smith and Hughes have realised change in local, national and international communities as is evidenced in the following examples: 

 **1. Changing museum practices and engaging new audiences in Portsmouth** 

 Since 2019 the work of both Smith and Hughes has impacted on the programming of the National Museum of the Royal Navy within the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard through applied theatre performance events that engage audiences in new interactive ways. The dockyard has an annual footfall of 950,000 visitors but they continually seek ways to engage new, harder to reach audiences, including young people and families. **\(S2\)**. 

 In April 2019, Smith’s work led to the organisation embracing puppetry within the museum setting for the first time for their popular *Horrible Histories Pirates* exhibition. The event’s producer, Carmen Flynn, noted, *‘Matt’s research into modes of Applied Theatre featuring puppetry meant that it proved to be a really interactive and engaging experience for all involved \[as\] it encouraged children to play and create within the new exhibit. It thereby led people to engage with the Historic Dockyard in a new, interactive way.’* **\(S2\)** 

 Hughes brought a neglected yet historically important exhibit in the museum to life for local school children. In May 2019, she staged the UK premiere of Finegan Kruckemeyer’s award\-winning play *Boats* as a promenade, storytelling experience aboard the 1915 warship HMS M.33, the least visited exhibit in the dockyard. In applying her research in ‘embodied historiography’, Hughes engaged students from underserved Portsmouth\-area schools with the ship and its history. A teacher from Park Community School reflected that Hughes’ work *‘encourages the kids to look wider than just school’* by extending their learning to such sites and their stories. **\(S4\)**. Carmen Flynn reflected that *‘the significance of \[this\] work…in engaging young people in new modes of experiencing and understanding our museum exhibits through theatre cannot be overstated because it set a great example for subsequent engagement work within the Dockyard’*. **\(S2\)** 

 Hughes’ research into Holocaust theatre has achieved impact through *Presence of the Past: Staging Holocaust Testimony,* an annual performance event staged for the Portsmouth community. Despite the pandemic causing the 2020 event to be cancelled, the project has already reached nearly 300 people in Portsmouth since the first event in 2018. It has impacted on a cross\-section of Portsmouth society, including adults with little or no connection to the Holocaust, local school children, university students and members of the local Jewish community, to ensure the continuation of collective Holocaust memory beyond the lives of those who survived it. Portsmouth teacher Tim Booker, wrote, *‘This project has had a profound impact on our students at Mayville High School, many of whom have never met a Holocaust survivor before. \[Furthermore, by\] seeing people who look like them, who are just a couple of years older than they are, our students come to understand that this history could happen in the present. In so doing, they come to understand that they bear the responsibility to one another to prevent such an atrocity from ever happening again.’* **\(S8\)** 

 **2. Attracting audiences and new approaches to community outreach for UK\-wide festivals** 

 In 2018, Smith’s research into the functionality of puppetry within applied theatre contexts addressing asylum led to the creation of *Puppet City,* which presented a new mode of engagement for children and families. Workshop participants build cityscapes from cardboard and then use puppetry to explore and reflect on them from the outsider perspective of the immigrant. *Puppet City* has been staged at festivals in Portsmouth \(2018 & 2019\) and Leicester \(2019\), as part of the work of Journeys Festival International, and in Bristol \(2019\), as part of the ‘Towards the Child Friendly City’ event organised by the community interest company, Playful Planet. Hundreds of people interacted with these performances and the Portsmouth Journeys Festival reached a total of 59,643 people. Claire Woollard, Producer of Portsmouth’s festival, reported that: *‘Puppet City was especially beneficial in encouraging people to stay and engage with the broader event, increasing the reach of our work to individuals who may not have stopped otherwise’*. **\(S1\)** She employed *Puppet City* in a follow\-up event in Portsmouth specifically to explore how the festival can develop its reach to new audiences. The project also impacted on the way *The Makers Guild,* a Portsmouth\-based Community Interest Company \( [<ins>www.makers\-guild.co</ins>](http://www.makers-guild.com/)<ins>m</ins>\), developed their work. As the Guild’s Director, Gavin Hodson, explained, engaging with Smith’s research and preparation for *Puppet City* altered their approach to community outreach and economic development work in the city. They embraced puppets and their making as a key and different mechanism for engaging their more than 200 members in fresh creative projects. **\(S3\)** 

 **3. Raising awareness and understanding of military conflict and trauma in the UK and US** 

 Hughes’ practice\-research with military veterans has had a transformative effect on audience understandings of conflict and military service. For the veterans, it has helped them to come to terms with service and trauma and aided mental wellbeing. Their performances are witnessed by civilian and military audiences and the format of sharing stories — veteran to veteran — in a multi\-layered audio\-visual staging results in the ex\-servicemen working through experiences of service and trauma in a powerful way for all involved. As RAF veteran\-turned\-performer, Rev \(Sqn Ldr\) Steve Radley observed, *‘This proves to be an affirming and healing experience, as I found telling my story releases emotions which otherwise remain trapped in my mind. The process of listening serves to build relationships between veterans and civilians as the latter learns about the former. Understanding helps remove fear and promotes love and acceptance.’* **\(S6\)** There have been 12 performances \(six since Hughes arrived at Portsmouth\) in different locations and formats which amount to a total audience of around 500 people. *The Veterans Project,* featuring a quartet of UK ex\-servicemen, was staged twice in Portsmouth in July and November of 2018 and again in Newcastle in June 2019. *Odyssey Home,* featuring female US veterans, was staged in Canton, NY in September 2017 and Boston, MA in August 2018. A storytelling session was held in Gosport, Hampshire, in May 2018 in association with the FirstLight Trust, a military wellness charity. This, along with the performances in Portsmouth, received media coverage from Solent TV **\(S7\)**, PureFM, Heart Radio and The Portsmouth News, which extended the reach of this transformative work to tens of thousands across the region. 

 **4. Transforming understanding and communication of urgent health issues in Kenya** 

 In 2019, the MRC\-funded ‘Tupumue’ project involved the puppet show *Billy’s Day Out* that was toured and performed to 900 school children in the Mukuru informal settlement and more affluent Buruburu division in Nairobi, Kenya. The Mukuru settlement has a population of around 700,000 people. Smith’s research was introduced as an innovative route to inform communities about the research project and lung disease issues. The project leader, Graham Devereux \(Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine\), described the introduction of puppets informed by the research of Matt Smith as *‘transformative’* in engaging the local Kenyan community: *‘the impact of puppetry is wider than we could have originally envisioned’* and opened up *‘new modes of engaging audiences and new ways of ensuring wide\-reaching public participation’*. Describing the performances of *Billy’s Day Out* and subsequent videos of the puppetry: *‘\[I\] was hugely impressed by the way the children in Nairobi schools responded to the puppets and able to understand the message that is being communicated’* **\(S5\)**. Professor Cindy Gray \(University of Glasgow\) concluded that *‘our collaboration with Smith and the work they informed was vital to the community, in Nairobi.’* **\(S10\)**. 

 In 2020, Smith and Hughes both contributed vital knowledge and community\-engagement techniques to the ACT \(Action against COVID Transmission\) project to support the Mukuru community in Nairobi in reducing COVID\-19 transmission. Muruku has more than 100,000 households spread over three villages and covering 650 acres, with families living in cramped conditions. Given the transmission pathways of COVID\-19, community engagement is essential for reducing the spread of the infection. As one of the community reflected, ‘ *People here live from hand to mouth, they don’t have time to go and research about COVID. Secondly, if you write a very long post about Covid people won’t have time to read, same to long press conferences. But when we use art to explain a whole concept and the people are able to internalise and interrogate it more’  \(S9\).** Hughes employed her research into digital storytelling to encourage local ways of expressing concerns about the developing pandemic. Smith drew on his pioneering research into applied puppetry techniques to offer local artists new communication tools. 21 local community practitioner ‘champions’ in Mukuru were supported and trained to use the techniques of digital storytelling and puppetry to engage local perspectives about the global pandemic. Community school teachers then used the skills training they received in their own teaching practice to enhance understanding and influence changes in behaviour to help reduce the transmission of the virus: *‘We had a programme at St. Michael’s secondary school that was meant to keep students busy and out of the slums…They made hand puppets. We also did some drawings of masks and the corona virus \(sic.\); this is all thanks to the knowledge acquired from the ACT project’* **\(S9\)** 

 Hughes’ digital storytelling documented the lived experience of Mukuru residents during the pandemic. As one of the community commented, *‘starting with the digital storytelling, we were sharing our own experiences of COVID\-19 in the community so you will find what we are talking about is what’s really happening on the ground’* **\(S9\)** 

 Community artists and youth activist groups continue to use the techniques that were introduced during this project to provide ongoing training for community health champions working in Mukuru on COVID prevention programmes. One champion commented, ‘ *I am a part of many organized groups, CBO’s and cooperatives, these methods will help me to mobilize and organize the community and to train others who don’t have these skills.’* **\(S9\)**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Cardiff University research into prehistoric food, feasting, and farming challenged assumptions on what and how people ate in the past by showing that food was varied, travelled long distances, and had social and cultural significance. This research underpinned a year\-long exhibition at Stonehenge and an accompanying wider events programme, which benefited English Heritage by increasing visitor numbers, enhancing visitor experience, upskilling volunteers, and embedding changes to site use. The researchers also reached non\-traditional audiences at 17 UK festivals and community\-led events and influenced the practice of heritage professionals. In total, they engaged over 580,000 people face\-to\-face and changed their understanding of prehistoric food and its relevance to modern cuisine. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 People eat to satisfy physical needs, but food is also a fundamental part of cultural and social interactions. Cardiff research into prehistoric farming, food, and feasting helped transform understanding of the economic, social, and cultural role of food in the past. 

 **2.1 The role of food in prehistoric society** 

 Prior to the Cardiff\-led research, the diversity of people undertaking rituals at Neolithic monuments and the extent of population movement were unknown. The Cardiff team revealed evidence of the earliest large\-scale celebrations in Britain and the most detailed picture yet of the degree of mobility across Britain at the time of Stonehenge – around 2500 BC. Supported by several major grants **\[G3.1\-G3.4\]**, the team also examined the manipulation of both the physical form and social meaning of food over the past 6,000 years by evidencing farming revolutions and culinary transformations. 

 The team developed new methodologies specifically to investigate ancient diets, particularly refining the use of strontium isotopes for food provenancing **\[3.1\]** and integrating zooarchaeology with lipid analyses **\[3.2\]**. The Cardiff team’s large\-scale application of direct dating and Bayesian statistics also revolutionised understanding of the timing and routes by which domestic crops and animals arrived in the UK and Europe **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. This enabled accurate and refined dating on a large scale for the first time, allowing identification of the cultural and dietary changes that accompanied this shift in food acquisition **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. 

 The researchers demonstrated that widely held assumptions \(that prehistoric diets were natural, dictated largely by practicality, focused on locally available resources, and involved minimal “food miles”\) do not stand up to the archaeological evidence. The uptake and form of farming practiced varied by location, and the choices go beyond pragmatism, instead showing preference and agency **\[3.1 to 3.5\]**. Significantly, the researchers: 

-  refined the dating of farming introduction in Britain **\[3.3, 3.4\]**; 

-  confirmed the presence of large\-scale feasting at the site of Durrington Walls near Stonehenge and connected this to ceremonial activities at the monument **\[3.1, 3.5\]**; 

-  showed that food resources were brought from across the British Isles to provision the communities around Stonehenge, moving over large distances **\[3.1, 3.5\]**; 

-  detailed the preparation, consumption and seasonality of food, and associated activities; and contrasted special and ‘utilitarian practices’ in Neolithic Britain **\[3.1 to 3.5\],** demonstrating that food played a significant role in social and cultural practices; 

-  highlighted preference and food intolerance, by showing a shift from fishing to dairying at the start of the Neolithic, whilst revealing \(through fats found in pottery\) that early farmers processed milk to overcome lactose intolerance **\[3.2, 3.4, 3.5\].** 

 **2.2 Archaeology and public engagement: Guerilla Archaeology** 

 Through Guerilla Archaeology, an engagement collective led by Mulville, the researchers developed a public engagement framework which employs archaeology to challenge preconceived assumptions. They developed new ways of working with hard\-to\-reach audiences in non\-traditional settings such as music festivals **\[3.6\]**. For example, Mulville identified that when individuals were less constrained by conventional methods of engaging with heritage, they became receptive to new explanations and proactive in interrogating information themselves **\[3.6\]**. This provocative approach to public engagement stimulates debate and leads to co\-creation of the past **\[3.6\]**. Building on these novel approaches, the team has collaborated with science and arts festivals, museums, youth organisations, and community groups local to Stonehenge to share their research on Neolithic food with new and non\-traditional audiences **\[3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cardiff research on prehistoric food and feasting underpinned the ‘Feast’ exhibition at English Heritage’s iconic site, Stonehenge. Using a strategic approach to public engagement developed through Guerilla Archaeology, the research also underpinned a series of interactive events across the UK \(including at Stonehenge itself\) and influenced wider heritage best practice. This engaged over 580,000 members of the public between 2016 and 2019 with lasting impact on how English Heritage presents its site and prehistoric food. 

 **4.1 Feast at Stonehenge: attracting visitors and redefining presentation of the past** 

 *“Cardiff University research on animal movement for food and feasting at Durrington Walls has underpinned the current interpretation that we provide to the 1.5 million visitors who come to Stonehenge each year…and revolutionised how people perceive prehistory”* **\[5.1** \- Sue Martindale, Volunteer Manager at English Heritage **\]**. 

 The Cardiff team worked with English Heritage from 2016 to co\-create the year\-long exhibition ‘Feast\! Food at Stonehenge’, showcasing prehistoric food. The exhibition ran at Stonehenge between October 2017 and October 2018. The team also developed a year of accompanying UK\-wide interactive events and workshops in 2018 \(funded by the AHRC \- ‘Consuming Prehistory’, £76,594 AH/R005621/1\) in collaboration with University of York. Susan Greaney, Stonehenge’s Senior Properties Historian, noted that *“the isotope analyses and interpretations conducted by Richard Madgwick and Jacqui Mulville formed a significant part of the research presented in the Feast exhibition…Knowing that people and animals travelled over long distances to the area completely changes how we think about the people who built Stonehenge, who they were and where they may have come from”* **\[5.2\]**. She notes that this major shift in understanding *“made media headlines across the world”* **\[5.2, 5.3\]**. Cardiff’s research also mapped a sudden uptake of dairying, which was particularly valuable as it provided wider context for the “ *evidence for dairy processing found at Durrington Walls*” and *“contributed to how we present resource availability and food processing in the past”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 The Feast Exhibition culminated with the ‘Big Feast Weekend’ \(BFW\) festival \(1\-2 September 2018\) which attracted over 11,000 people **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. Organised by Cardiff’s Consuming Prehistory Postdoctoral Research Assistant Julia Best, the event embedded Guerilla Archaeology’s provocative and interactive methods to explore farming and feasting in Britain around the time that Stonehenge was built **\[5.1\]**. Participants were engaged through: ‘Stonehengebury’s’ \(a pop\-up immersive Neolithic shop\), recipe creation, take home gardening kits, flour and pottery making, butchery demonstrations, cooking a Neolithic feast, themed catering, and pop\-up hand\-on talks by researchers **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. As *“the first of its’ kind at Stonehenge”* Martindale confirms that *“we would not have been able to develop this without the CU research and the expertise of Guerilla Archaeology”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 **a. Attracting visitors and enhancing experience** 

 The Feast Exhibition: 

-  attracted over 560,000 visitors *,* which formed part of *“a 14.5% increase in visitor numbers from the previous year”* **\[5.2\]**; 

-  was described by 1 in 7 visitors as *“very influential”* in their decision to visit Stonehenge **\[5.2, 5.4\]** and a third of visitors said it significantly increased enjoyment of the site **\[5.4\]**; 

-  increased revenue for English Heritage. With 1 in 7 visitors recording that the Feast Exhibition strongly influenced their decision to visit, Greaney states that this *“income could equate to £2.7 million”* \(based on average ticket price of £12 \* 225,714\) **\[5.2\]**; 

-  drew a more diverse pool of visitors, with 55% international visitors, compared to an English Heritage project average of 23% **\[5.4\]**. 

 An evaluation survey commission by English Heritage noted that visitors to the exhibition rated their Stonehenge experience “ *significantly higher*” than those just visiting the monument **\[5.4\]**.  Additionally, the BFW festival *“was significant in increasing visitor duration, engagement, and information retention”* **\[5.2\]**. The festival’s interactive elements “ *created excitement and enhanced experience”* adding an extra dimension for younger visitors, for whom Stonehenge itself is not particularly exciting as “ *they cannot touch it or independently explore it”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 **b. Changing knowledge of prehistoric food** 

 Greaney confirmed that Feast \(both the exhibition and the BFW festival\) *“created knowledge change for visitors”* **\[5.2\]**. This is further evidenced by visitor feedback: one visitor noted that Feast “ *absolutely \[added value\], I know more than I did going in”,* and another that *“we could see how they lived… how they made their food. Can imagine what it would be like”* **\[5.4\]**. Edwards Heritage, food historians/interpretation specialists who delivered cooking recreations at the BFW festival, also noted that the practical and interactive format of the events run by the team created *“significant knowledge change in the visitors’ understanding of prehistoric technology and food”* and allowed visitors to engage on a personal level **\[5.5\]**. For both staff and visitors, the additional sensory experience of smell *“put the people back into the past”* by evoking a very "" *different understanding of what it would have actually been like to attend a feast at Stonehenge thousands of years ago”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 Accompanying online resources on the English Heritage website, which are available to people all over the world, have had over 41,700 unique views from Oct 2017 **\[5.2\]** and a video on cheesemaking has been viewed more than 173,262 times **\[5.1\]**. For English Heritage, this popularity highlights *“the universal attraction of Food and Feasting, and why it has become a key component of how we present Stonehenge to the world”* **\[5.2\]**. The researchers have stimulated ongoing knowledge change by developing \(in collaboration with English Heritage and STEM Learning\) a suite of KS2, KS4 and KS5 educational resources for the STEML website on food and feasting at the time of Stonehenge. The resources, described by teachers as showcasing *“strong links between the history and science”* **\[5.6a\]**, have been viewed over 7,200 times, had 3,079 unique downloads, 1,061 additional video watches, and have been used in the UK and abroad **\[5.6b\].** 

 **4.2 Changing heritage practice** 

 **a. Training heritage volunteers and professionals** 

 Following the Feast activities, Greaney noted that *“the most major knowledge change was amongst our volunteers and staff in that they learnt a huge amount from the exhibition, workshops run throughout the project, and the feast weekend”* **\[5.2\]**. The success of the exhibition demonstrated to English Heritage “ *the importance of having new research incorporated into our displays and into our staff and volunteer training to equip them with information in a timely fashion”* **\[5.2\]**. To achieve this, the Consuming Prehistory team worked with 21 \(of around 50\) Stonehenge site volunteers from 2016 to share knowledge of relevant research such as the development of farming, feasting, mobility, and food processing **\[5.1\]**. 

 The activities and exhibition increased the volunteers’ ability to confidently share new research around food and feasting with visitors **\[5.1\]**. It also meant they could provide interactive experiences through live demonstrations of ancient cooking techniques, something not previously delivered at the site, and plan the development of new projects such as a Neolithic Garden \(where prehistoric plants will be grown and showcased\) **\[5.1\]**. This has been beneficial as *“these types of meaningful activities engage and enthuse volunteers, increasing retention and encouraging others to join the team. Volunteers are keen to share their new skills with the public and are able to speak from experience, so enriching their visits”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 Collaboration with the Cardiff team for the BFW also influenced and enhanced the practice of Edwards Heritage **\[5.5\]**. The approaches developed for the BFW have led to their continued experimentation with prehistoric cookery, including creating prehistoric\-themed menus with Heston Blumenthal and The Fat Duck group \(Blumenthal’s restaurant group\) **\[5.5\]**. This allowed Edwards Heritage to reach broader audiences and further challenge preconceptions of prehistoric food, by showing that *“prehistoric food certainly does not have to be boring, but can appeal to all the senses of taste, display and feasting that we enjoy today”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 **b. Embedding changes to site use at Stonehenge** 

 Greaney confirmed that the Feast Exhibition and BFW festival delivered by the Cardiff team *“has had lasting legacy in how we now present Stonehenge \(e.g. the catchment area of the monument and the movement of people/animals\), how we conceptualise use of our site space \(e.g. interactive large\-scale events\), and how we are developing future public interactions”* **\[5.2\]**. The Feast Exhibition was the first to meet English Heritage’s objective of using its indoor temporary exhibition space to present new archaeological research to the public **\[5.2\]** and its success led English Heritage’s summary report to recommend that *“future exhibitions should adopt the best practice and ‘wow’ factor of the exhibits shown in Feast”* **\[5.4\]**. ‘Making Connections’, the exhibition that followed Feast, explicitly *“focused on creating such a wow factor”* and continued “ *to incorporate new research and person\-focused pasts”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 The BFW festival was the first time that English Heritage used the Stonehenge site for large\-scale visual events **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. Greaney stated that in contrast to previous events *“the Big Feast Weekend was visible from the carpark and drew people through the space from the visitor centre. Even if people did not know the event was taking place, on arrival you could see it, smell it, and hear it”.* She added that it *“influenced site use at Stonehenge”* as its success *“gave confidence to English Heritage staff that event\-led and outdoor activities/events are not only feasible, but successful, and make good use of the space and resources available”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 The events contributed to strategic discussions to implement a more event\-based and interactive format at Stonehenge over the next decade **\[5.2\]**. These discussions are particularly relevant in light of COVID\-19 *as “a novel example of site use”* which maximises the space available **\[5.2\]**.  As a result of the confidence created by Feast, volunteers and staff have run other public engagement activities **\[5.1\]** and Greaney noted that now *“people expect to see demonstrations and things happening within the space at Stonehenge”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 **4.3 Opening archaeology to non\-traditional audiences** 

 The Cardiff team, via their co\-creative Guerilla Archaeology approaches, expanded the reach of their work by delivering interactive events, developed with English Heritage for Feast, to over 20,000 people at 17 major music, arts, and science festivals \(e.g. Settlement; Green Man; Bluedot; Lunar; Shambala; How The Light Gets In; New Scientist Live\) and community\-led events near Stonehenge \(e.g. Wiltshire and Swindon Food Festival; Ready Steady Cook: Neolithic\) between 2018\-2019 **\[5.7\]**. The activities have also drawn over 230,000 social media interactions **\[5.7\]** and the research findings have attracted over 385 pieces of media coverage worldwide, including the UK, USA, Canada and Australia **\[5.3\]**. Participant responses highlight knowledge change and the importance of linking archaeology to modern experience, for example: *“I had no idea that the first farmers were lactose intolerant…It makes the past more relatable and gives me evidence when people say intolerances are a modern fad\!”* **\[5.8\]**. 

 In one example of a community\-led event, ‘Ready Steady Cook: Neolithic’ the Cardiff team worked with Operation Nightingale \(which uses archaeology and cultural heritage to assist the recovery of service personnel\) to recreate prehistoric food near Stonehenge. Richard Osgood \(Defence Infrastructure Organisation Senior Archaeologist\) confirmed that several participants had “ *experienced the landscape in some depth in their military training*”, that they “ *learnt more about the past and their local heritage through the event*” and as a result “ *feel altogether differently about lands upon which they trained*” **\[5.9\]**. He notes the benefits of introducing participants to archaeology for the first time as it *“challenges them to use mental AND physical skills”* which *“together provide a superb package for recovery and wellbeing”* **\[5.9\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The development of globally relevant healthcare technologies for the benefit of patients and the economy is a core theme in the Ulster Engineering research portfolio. Our research is intricately linked with international partners in both the commercial and clinical spheres. It has impacted local government policy through our **leadership in forums that include MATRIX** and **Innovate UK/Health KTN**. We have also witnessed global impact through our representation in international scientific forums such as **Computing in Cardiology** and the **International Society for Computerised Electrocardiology,** and our **ECG signal processing algorithms have been adopted by the United States Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\)**. Collectively, this activity has resulted in the growth of the GBP9,300,000 industry\-focused Connected Health Innovation Centre \(CHIC\) established at Ulster, the EUR8,400,000 Eastern Corridor Medical Engineering Centre \(ECME\), the GBP7,300,000 industry\-focused Biodevices Rapid Prototyping Laboratory and the showcasing of our **research on the global stage through our team’s 3rd place success in the XPRIZE Tricoder competition**. Our research has recently resulted in the sale of the successful Ulster spin\-out company **Intelesens to Ultralinq for** \[text removed for publication\] **\(2017\).** The commercialisation of this cardiovascular monitoring technology has had beneficial impact on health costs and patients’ lives on a global scale over the past seven years. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Ulster has an extensive record in the development of healthcare sensor systems and is unique in its ability to deliver on the entire technology stack required in the **development of end\-to\- end, ‘sensor\-to\-diagnosis', healthcare technology devices**. These activities range from the design, development, and fabrication of physical sensing electrodes to the development of software algorithms for highly accurate automated diagnosis and decision support. A key specific theme in Nanotechnology and Integrated Bioengineering Centre’s \(NIBEC\) record of accomplishment over the past 25 years has been major advancements in the **acquisition and analysis of cardiac bio\-signals**. 

 **ECG Electrode System Development \-** Early work during this period in the development of flexible multi sensor arrays **\[R1\] \(Lemoine, McLaughlin, Anderson, 2000\)** and novel low impedance Agr/AgCl colloid inks **\[R2\] \(McLaughlin, 2002\)** resulted in state\-of\-the\-art dry electrode systems for ECG measurement. A major novelty of this work was the focus on reducing electrode impedance, through Ag/AgCl plasma surface modification, and accommodation for body motion artefacts using a mixture of advanced micro\-fabrication techniques with a high\-volume manufacturing focus. This electrode research was the catalyst for the formation of Intelesens Ltd by McLaughlin, Anderson, and McAdams in 2001. Even though the technology had taken on a commercial development route, the focus remained on pursuing innovation through research. One of the critical avenues for innovation advantage was the early adoption of data analytics and data science techniques to help address challenges in improving the signal quality in mobile cardiac monitoring systems. This work included the analysis of large datasets to identify patterns that helped to identify the best recording site/electrode positions for recording ECGs in the context of various cardiac abnormalities **\[R3\] \(Finlay, 2010\)**. Importantly, this has included optimised ECG electrode locations for detecting general ventricular arrhythmias **\[R4\]\(Finlay, 2013\)** as well as accurately diagnosing atrial fibrillation **\[R5\] \(Finlay, Guldenring, Bond, McLaughlin, 2016\)**. 

 **ECG Algorithm Developments** – NIBEC's expertise in the ECG data analytics has been **recognized by scientists from the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\)** via a request for assistance in the development of an algorithm to transform data from one ECG recording format to another to determine the potential cardiac risk of newly developed drugs. Ulster published this work in **collaboration with the FDA** and our algorithm was shown to be more accurate than the existing state of the art methods **\[R6\] \(Finlay, Guldenring, Bond, McLaughlin, 2015\)**. In recognition of the importance of these developments, we received an invite \(Guldenring\) to present this work at the prestigious International Society for Computerized Electrocardiology \(ISCE\) Annual Conference in 2017. As a result of this activity, **Ulster’s algorithm has now been fully adopted by the FDA** and used for computing ECG biomarkers in drug trials. The FDA has also described **our algorithm in the current draft standard and associated reports \(IEC 80601\-2\-86\)**. 

 **Contributions to the International Health Technology Knowledge Base \-** Over and above published scientific outputs, Ulster’s researchers have made a significant contribution via strategic/international Scientific Committees and Boards: McLaughlin in MATRIX NI and Innovate UK; KTN Healthcare Technology Board in 2015; Finlay in Computing in Cardiology Board of Directors Appointment \(2012\-2020\) and International Society for Computerised Electrocardiology \(2014\-2017\). Most recently, McLaughlin was appointed to the UK Rapid Test Consortium \(UK\-RTC\) which has directed the development and manufacture of the approved COVID\-19 Point of Care lateral flow tests as part of the Government’s five pillar national testing strategy for SARS\-CoV\-2.

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Queen Mary’s Prof. Pasi has revolutionised treatment for haemophilia and also made it more accessible, while offering a potential cure for the condition. Pasi’s group has led clinical development programmes for new treatments that reduce the number of clotting factor infusions required to manage the disease. Typically, infusions are frequent and burdensome for both patients and healthcare systems, while also being either impractical or inaccessible for 75% of the global population of haemophiliacs. Pasi’s novel therapies reduce the need for infusions by up to one\-third in haemophilia A and half in haemophilia B. These therapies have been approved and licensed globally since 2014, and have been recommended in UK guidelines since 2016. Pasi has also developed a clinical programme for a gene therapy for severe haemophilia A, which received European Medical Agency approval in 2016. Pasi’s developments overcome the problem of accessibility of treatment at a global level, and help directly alleviate the suffering and burden experienced by patients with severe forms of the disease. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Haemophilia is a rare blood disease that affects about 7 in 100,000 people \(around 36,000 people in Europe, mostly men\). The condition is caused by defects in genes associated with coagulation and exists in two types: Haemophilia A \(caused by a defect in the production of coagulation factor VIII\) and Haemophilia B \(caused by a far less common defect in the production of factor IX\). 

 Treating severe haemophilia currently involves regular infusions of clotting factor concentrate, given every alternate day for haemophilia A and at least twice a week for haemophilia B. Although this treatment is regarded as state\-of\-the\-art, it does not completely eliminate bleeding risk and is a significant treatment burden for men with severe haemophilia. Moreover, most \(75%\) of the world’s haemophiliac population cannot access treatment— and, even if they did, in many places, the therapies would be entirely impracticable due to the demanding nature of the treatment regime. Therefore, there is a need for therapies that are less invasive — such as less frequent infusions, or one\-off approaches such as gene therapy — to enable simpler, less burdensome treatment options for patients globally. 

#  Development of bioengineered coagulation factor proteins VIII and IX 

 Coagulation factor proteins can now be bioengineered with a potentially prolonged half\-life, which would mean less frequent treatments for patients. Pasi worked on previous clinical trials to develop the first factor IX proteins in the 1990s. Thus, due to this expertise and experience, Pasi co\-led a more recent multi\-centre global programme to develop Fc fusion proteins for coagulation factors VIII and IX. The new clinical trials — conducted in collaboration with Jerry Powell at the University of California, Davis and sponsored by Biogen Inc. — began in 2010 and became the world’s largest phase 3 programmes in haemophilia \[3.1, 3.2\]. The trials led to a change in treatment regime for patients with the disease, reducing the numbers of infusions required by one\-third in haemophilia A patients and half in haemophilia B patients, thereby helping alleviate the issues of treatment burden and accessibility. 

#  Development of gene addition therapy using AAV5\-FVIII 

 Gene therapies hold great potential in treating various conditions. Pasi worked with BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. to develop a clinical research programme for severe haemophilia A, a gene addition technology using the vector AAV5\-FVIII \(adeno\-associated virus serotype 5 \(AAV5\) encoding a B\-domain\-deleted human factor VIII\). After being given once to the patient via an injection into a vein, the virus carries the factor VIII gene into the liver cells, enabling them to produce the missing factor VIII. The adeno\-associated virus does not cause disease in humans. The programme had outstanding results \[3.3, 3.4\]: factor VIII levels normalised in 11 of 13 patients treated at therapeutic dose, with all patients coming off factor replacement therapy. This work offers the real prospect of a ‘cure’ for severe haemophilia, especially given that further follow\-up data has shown continued effectiveness after three years \[3.5\].

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research by Queen Mary’s Prof. Pasi has provided evidence of the clinical efficacy and safety of novel, cutting\-edge therapies for treating haemophilia. This has resulted in life\-changing new treatments being brought to market. Based on Pasi’s findings, UK guidelines for treatment of haemophilia have been updated to recommend the use of these therapies in routine clinical practice, in turn providing better care, prognosis, and quality of life to patients \(and families\) who would typically be debilitated by the condition. 

#  Uptake of the new therapies into clinical guidelines and practice 

 The clinical trials and multi\-centre global studies led by Pasi demonstrate that the newly developed coagulation factor proteins for factor VIII and factor IX are safe and effective, and also offered evidence of the efficacy of AAV5\-FVIII gene therapy \(across phase 1/2 programmes and first part of phase 3 studies\). This work directly enabled \[5.1\-5.5\]: 



 Prof. David Lillicrap from the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine at Queen’s University, Canada said “to prevent spontaneous episodes of bleeding, patients with severe haemophilia have had to inject their substitution clotting factor 2\-3 times each week to maintain protective levels of the missing protein. Thus, although this treatment is safe and effective the quality of life of these patients left a lot to be desired” \[5.6\]. However, Eloctate and Alprolix make it possible to *“*reduce the number of infusions while the bleeding rate remains comparable with that of more frequent infusions with classic FVIII and FIX products. This improves the adherence and quality of life for patients, and for children who have difficult venous access it might reduce the need for intravenous catheters during the first years of life,” according to the Director of the PedNet Haemophilia Research Foundation, Dr. H. Marijke van den Berg \[5.7\]. 

 In 2016, Pasi also helped shape the UK’s Haemophilia Centres’ Doctors’ Organisation national guidelines, which now recommend the use of these therapies in routine clinical practice \[5.8\]. 

#  Improving patients’ lives 

 By making extended half\-life therapies available on a wider scale, Pasi has helped reduce the numbers of infusions required by patients to manage their condition by one\-third in haemophilia A and half in haemophilia B. 

 For patient Jack \[5.9\], bleeding centred around his ankles would usually mean two or three days of rest, treatment and recuperation. His health was particularly worrisome for his family and girlfriend, and he was already being treated for arthritis as a result of repeated ankle bleeds. However, since starting on AAV5\-FVIII treatment Jack has not needed any treatment for bleeding, saying “The treatment has given my family, friends and girlfriend the freedom not to worry. It’s a massive change for them because they know I’m protected now.” 

 Another patient, Darren, was also suffering from co\-morbidities related to haemophilia bleeds — namely arthritis and damage in some joints. “It was such a relief to know \[these\] wouldn’t continue to get worse,” says Darren, going on to state that “the treatment has changed my life considerably.” Within a few days of starting the AAV5\-FVIII treatment, Darren’s coagulation factor levels had already increased. “I started noticing that minor knocks weren’t bruising like they used to,” he said. Darren gives an example of the improvement of his quality of life: “Just a week after treatment, I was at work when a child accidently rammed me with a shopping trolley. I thought ‘oh no, that’s really going to be bad’, and I was prepared for a bad ankle bleed. But instead of needing four days of bed rest it healed within 24 hours. I couldn’t believe it. It’s brilliant not having to worry all the time whether I might bump or scratch myself. There’s no more need to panic.” Darren’s factor VIII levels continued to rise and a month later, his readings were up to 90% of normal levels \[5.10\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Since 2017, **Dr Jasjit** **Singh’s** ESRC/CREST\-funded research has been central to re\-framing the terms of public debate and understanding – regionally, nationally and internationally – regarding Sikh activism in the UK and beyond. This research provides new historical narratives and analyses leading to three main impacts: 

1.  Shaping policy and practice relating to Sikhs at various levels of governance in the UK, including the Home Office, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government \(MHCLG\), counter\-extremism agencies, and broadcast regulators, such as the Office for Communications \(OFCOM\); 

1.  Re\-framing media debate and understandings of ‘Sikh extremism’ in diaspora, particularly in the UK, India and Canada; 

1.  Empowering Sikh communities and organisations by providing prominent open access resources and facilitating open dialogue community events that foster greater community cohesion and education. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2015, headlines in the British and Indian media drew attention to the risk of the radicalisation of factions within the British Sikh community that would be a threat to both countries. Responding to the dearth of academic literature on the subject, **Dr Jasjit** **Singh’s** 2017 ESRC/CREST\-funded open access report *The Idea, Context, Framing and Realities of ‘Sikh Radicalisation’ in Britain* \( **4, Grant I**\) provides the first empirical examination of so\-called ‘Sikh radicalisation’ in diaspora. **Singh** explores the historical framing of ‘Sikh extremism’ \(a term used interchangeably with ‘Sikh radicalisation’\), the context of reported incidents, the key narratives and issues leading to these incidents and an analysis of the various channels through which these narratives are transmitted. His research into contemporary Sikh activism in diaspora unpacks and de\-mythologises claims about ‘Sikh radicalisation,’ presenting fresh insights in five key areas: 

1.  **Framing Sikh activism in Britain** – Providing the first in\-depth analysis of the framing of ‘Sikh extremism’ \( **2**\), **Singh’s** research analyses the persistence of concerns about Sikh extremism, particularly given the general non\-violent nature of ‘Sikh militancy’ \(Wallace 2011\). He argues that these concerns are impacted by \(a\) the racialisation of religious minorities, \(b\) a specific type of ‘Indian secularism’ which frames Indian legislation and media reporting, and \(c\) the post 9/11 securitisation and increased surveillance of Sikh bodies as part of the ‘War on Terror’ with its concerns about ‘religious violence’ and the necessity of the secular nation state to ensure that any such violence is suitably policed \( **2**\). 

1.  **Narratives and issues** – By presenting an account of the narratives and issues which contribute to Sikh protests and incidents based on historical analyses and ethnographic research \( **1** and **2**\), **Singh** has elucidated the relationships between narratives, incidents and flashpoints and how the framing of these various incidents impacts on policy and media discourse around Sikhs in diaspora \( **2** and **4**\). 

1.  **Transmission of narratives** – Building on his previous work on religious transmission among Sikhs in diaspora \( **5**\), **Singh’s** analysis of the transmission of Sikh narratives through families and institutions \( **6**\), music, clothing, art \( **Grant II**\) and online through Sikh media/social media \( **4** and **5**\) has provided significant detail around the role and impact of these methods of transmission. 

1.  **Types of Sikh activism** – Through an innovative typology of Sikh activism, **Singh** \( **1** and **4**\) has provided an analysis of who participates in Sikh issues and why. This typology presents a framework of how the various narratives and issues contribute to different types of Sikh activism, beyond the simplistic labelling of these issues as ‘extremist’. 

1.  **Impact of Sikh activism in Diaspora** – By highlighting that the main threat to community relations is from individual or group vigilantism resulting from internal Sikh issues/disputes or from the exploitation of local inter\-community tensions, **Singh** has uncovered the socio\-political drivers behind these types of issue \( **4**\), presenting an analysis of the different impacts of Sikh activism in Diaspora around Sedgwick’s \(2010: 479\) model of the different contexts and agendas concerned with ‘radical’ activity: 1\) the security agenda, 2\) the integration agenda, 3\) the foreign policy agenda and 4\) religious community agendas \( **4**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Building on earlier work on British Sikh communities \( **5** and **6**\), **Dr Jasjit** **Singh’s** ESRC/CREST\-funded report \( **4**\) has had significant traction both nationally and internationally particularly in the UK, Canada and India \( **A**; cited 31 times in media across 5 countries/regions and 3 continents\), whilst subsequent publications have broadened the scope to consider different types of Sikh activism in general \( **1**\) alongside an analysis of the framing and reporting of ‘Sikh extremism’ \( **2**\). 

 **Impact 1:** **Shaping Policy and Practice in UK Government and Agencies** 

 **Singh**’s report has been recognised as a crucial resource for bolstering British government and agencies’ understanding of the contexts and issues affecting Sikh communities in the UK. The Chair of the Home Office Sikh Association \(HOSA\) observed that the report: 

 *has been of tremendous use within Government. \[…\] I have already referred the report to various departments within the Home Office, security colleagues and wider Civil Service. Having robust and credible research has been of great benefit to facilitate the report to a number of Government departments in the increasing understandings of Sikh issues* \( **B**\) 

 Deemed *“ground\-breaking research”* by the Team Leader of Faith Engagement, MHCLG, *“which clearly outlines the main internal and external issues facing the Sikh community in Britain”* \( **C**\), **Singh’s** report was also recognised by the British government for its ‘outstanding contributions to challenging community narratives’ during its Vaisakhi Event 2018 held at 10 Downing Street where **Singh** was invited to meet and present his report to the Prime Minister. As a member of the MHCLG ‘Sikh Roundtable’ \(2017\-2019\) **Singh** is regularly invited to contribute to discussions around government policy regarding Sikhs. This had life\-changing effects in summer 2018 in the context of the ongoing persecution of Sikhs by the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Home Office updated its *Country Policy and Information Note Afghanistan: Hindus and Sikhs* document \(Version 4.0, July 2018\) following recommendation by **Singh** concerning the languages spoken by Afghan Sikhs. **Singh** has also provided expert testimony on Afghan Sikh asylum cases for use by Legal Justice Solicitors and No.5 Chambers, as evidenced in Immigration and Asylum Appeal PA/03980/2017 \( **D**\) **.** 

 As part of OFCOM’s role in policing incitement and hate speech, **Singh’s** research was directly cited in Broadcast Bulletin 373 \(25.02.2019\), in which it was used to assess whether or not a Sikh television station had breached regulatory guidelines \( **E**\). In the context of the UK government’s various counter\-extremism strategies, **Singh’s** research was also cited in a 2019 report published by the Commission for Countering Extremism about Sikh activism in Britain \( **F**\), indicating the ongoing relevance of his research for national governance agencies in the UK. Indeed, Singh has become a go\-to expert for policymakers to understand the context and dynamics of the Sikh community in Britain, most recently, for example, presenting oral evidence to the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Religion in the Media \(May 2020\). 

 **Impact 2:** **Re\-framing media debate and understandings of Sikh activism in diaspora** 

 As the first report to provide an analysis of claims about ‘Sikh extremism’ in the context of diasporic communities \(in this case in the UK\) during a period of heightened anxiety and media coverage about radicalisation in the UK and India, Singh’s report was immediately taken up at national level in both the UK and Canada. The report received coverage in mainstream British and Indian national news media and current affairs programmes upon publication in November 2017, including *BBC Radio 4 Sunday*, *BBC Asian Network's Big Debate* and the *Times of India* \(Dec 2017\). The report was immediately referenced by commentators in India, who reported how *“the Leeds research found no evidence – or rather substance – in allegations or complaints*” about Sikh extremism \( **A**\). 

 **Singh’s** report then took on transatlantic significance in the context of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau’s visit to India in March 2018, when claims about Sikh extremism in Canada, and the Liberal government’s complicity in it, were widely circulated across various Indian media outlets. **Singh’s** report was cited in the Canadian media to question such claims, with **Singh** also commissioned by *The Conversation* \(27.03.2018\) to write on the subject. This piece was picked up by a number of other online outlets including: *Quartz, India* \(28.03.2018\), *Scroll.in* \(29.03.2018\), *The Wire* \(28.03.2018\) and *Business Standard India* \(29.03.2018\). As of January 2021, this article has been viewed over 59,000 times \( **A**\). **Singh’s** report continues to act as a cornerstone of the debate. 

 In April 2018, **Singh,** as a recognised expert on the media framing of Sikh extremism, was invited to participate in one of the World Sikh Organization of Canada \(WSO\) \#AskCanadianSikhs events, which were organised across Canada in response to media coverage of alleged Sikh extremism in Canada. WSO’s President observed: 

 *Dr **Singh’s** research provides the community with a robust response to these allegations and established, with evidence, that allegations of rising extremism are unfounded and not reflective of the facts. Dr. **Singh's** work has been an important element in discussions on ‘Sikh extremism’ in the West* \( **G**\) 

 Shortly afterwards, on the eve of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the UK for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting \(CHOGM\) in April 2018, **Singh’s** report was cited by the Sikh Federation in its letter to British Prime Minister Theresa May contesting claims that Sikh activism is extremism and urging May to question Modi about these allegations \( **H**\). Again, the research was cited in media coverage, with the online news outlet *Media Diversified*, for instance, stating about the report: *“such responses have been essential in giving voice to the Sikh community”* \(19.04.18\). In March 2019 **Singh** was again invited by the WSO to headline panel discussions in Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver focusing on the inclusion of ‘Sikh \(Khalistani\) Extremism’ in Public Safety Canada’s 2018 ‘Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada’. These events attracted large and diverse audiences, including Parliamentarians and leading community figures. 

 **Singh’s** research fed into the production of two INFORM/Department of Education guidance booklets for British schools: *Establishing the Credentials of Faith Traditions* and *Vetting External Speakers to Schools*. Researchers at the educational charity INFORM *“found Dr **Singh’s** work invaluable”* in writing the Sikh sections of both booklets, as his report *“is the most current and relevant work on UK Sikh communities, and particularly the issues which young Sikhs face, that is available”*, concluding: *“it contributed greatly to our understanding”* \( **I**\). **Singh’s** expertise led to an invitation from REACH PLC, the largest national and regional news publisher in the UK, to deliver training to its journalists \(July 2020\). 

 Its use as a frequent point of reference has placed **Singh’s** report as the top result when ‘Sikh radicalisation’ is entered into Google, Bing and Yahoo search engines \(22.06.2020\), ensuring that his research continues to be a critical point of reference in debate and understanding of the issue. 

 **Impact 3: Empowering Sikh communities and organisations** 

 **Singh’s** report provides in\-depth analysis of Sikh activism in the UK and has been embraced as a key historical resource for Sikhs, promoted by Sikh media and educational organisations, including *Basics of Sikhi* and *Naujawani* and enthusiastically embraced by commentators, such as *KTV* *London*’s presenter: 

 *You’ve joined the dots here, and I think that’s what’s so great about this report, we haven’t had that before \[…\] it is quite overwhelming really to look at it and think: this is amazing, there is a huge history here to read through and not to take for granted \[...\] this is actually the first report \[when ‘Sikh radicalisation’ is typed into a search engine\] which is great because if anyone is writing an article they’ve got no excuse to get it wrong* \( **A**; 1,500 views via *KTV’*s Facebook channel\) 

 Indeed, **Singh’s** report was used in a complaint to Canada’s National News Media Council \(NNC\) by the Sikh Press Association \(Sikh PA\) against the *Toronto Sun*. As reported in *The Indo\-Canadian Voice* \(06.05.2018\), Sikh PA complained about the *Toronto Sun*’s factually inaccurate and prejudicial use of the term Shaheed \(‘martyr’\) in a Sikh context and *“recommended his \[ **Singh’s**\] research, which included an explanation of the concept of shaheed, to the* Toronto Sun *and the NNC”*. The complaint was subsequently upheld by the NNC \( **A**\). 

 In developing his report, **Singh** undertook a series of community consultations hosted by various Sikh organisations across the UK. The Sikh Press Association hosted **Singh’s** community consultation event in Southall, which, for its Press Officer *“set a standard now for how this community views academic research projects”;* the Press Officer emphasised the *“levels of transparency and the levels of interaction”* that are *“always going to put anything else that comes through under scrutiny, which is \[…\] the right way forward for real and authentic insights into the Sikh community.*” \( **J**\) 

 **Singh’s** community consultation in Leeds led to the establishment of Sikh Alliance Yorkshire \(SAY\), which has gone on to hold open community consultations on a variety of topics, including mental health, hate crime and bullying, and loneliness. SAY’s Co\-Chair explained: 

 *There was an opportunity to have dialogue \[...\] using that same model, we thought well, let's build on that and really create our organisation, Sikh Alliance Yorkshire, to do that same kind of thing* \( **J**\) 

 Since taking part in the hate crime and bullying event in February 2019, West Yorkshire Police’s Strategic Engagement Officer described how he has *“been able to call on **Singh’s** expertise in a number of cases when looking to understand local, national and international issues which may affect the local Sikh community.”* \( **K**\). Moreover, **Singh’s** community\-centric method of engagement now adopted by SAY is *“a massive benefit to Police/Community Relations, bringing Sikhs and others together from all parts of the city to talk honestly and critically about substantive issues is a remarkable plus,”* capturing how **Singh’s** research has become embedded in local and regional community work in the UK, as well as shaping international dialogue and understanding of Sikh\-related issues as far afield as Canada.

 **Database algorithm and cybervictimisation;** 

 The UK’s CAID has grown exponentially, containing over 13 million images and processing the sheer quantity of new and duplicated images is becoming an increasing burden to investigative teams. Law enforcement branches used two primary methods to handle the images: 1\) the pattern\-matching technique, which identifies and matches images based on key vectors; or 2\) matching hash sets, which calculates a ‘fingerprint’ for an image based on perceptual details. However, the abundancy of photo\-editing software increased the variation of images that can be produced from a single photo resulting in an increased unreliability of the matching systems. 

 As a consequence, investigating teams had to manually catalogue many of the images to fulfil UK legal requirements. 

 Dr Al\-Nemrat addressed this problem by modelling a statistical algorithm which can automatically identify and cluster copies of the same image from different sources. Converting images into two different hash values \(MD5 and SHA\-1\) to cluster similar images and then collating different statistical analysis tools, the algorithm allows investigative organisations to handle large quantities of images in a short period of time with greater accuracy and reliability than previous methods by constraining the search to a subset based on sound statistical principles. **\(R1\)** 

 Al\-Nemrat’s research pointed to strong associations between online activity and time spent online and cybervictimisation, and that legislative measures did not sufficiently address the problem. The work supported the development of a comprehensive Incident Response Framework \(IRF\), which informed legal authorities and victims’ service provision **\(R2\)**. 

 **The ASPIRE Toolchain;** 

 The latest BSA Global Software Piracy Study shows the continuous worldwide presence of online piracy of digital contents, amounting to $46.3 billion in losses due to software piracy. The team, led by Falcarin, conducted research contributing to the creation of the first open\-source toolchain of obfuscators and software protections for native code in Android apps within the ASPIRE research project. 

 Falcarin led the development, together with Ghent University, of the ASPIRE renewability framework \(plugin of the ASPIRE toolchain\) for implementing dynamic updates of binary code on Android apps **\(R3\)** and advanced features for making  other types of protection renewable and combinable; the use of renewable and diversified protections, reducing the window of opportunity for generating income from an attack, aims at increasing the effort needed to identify and manually exploit successful attack vectors, mitigating the risk of automated scale\-up exploitation. 

 Falcarin worked on modelling Man\-At\-The\-End \(MATE\) attacks on industry applications, showing different attacks on Android apps developed by three companies **\(R4\)**. This work helped the companies in understanding which attack paths were easier for the attackers, helping them to focus on improving the protections involved. 

 Falcarin helped tackling the open problem of security assessment of protected apps, applying the open\-coding qualitative analysis to reports written by penetration testers from companies in the ASPIRE project: this work helped companies understanding the dependencies and conflicts between different protections **\(R5\)**. As a result, a public challenge was organised, where the participants needed to find a secret key hidden in eight versions of an application, each protected with a different subset of protections: the winner only hacked five of them, and two of the three non\-hacked versions contained were protected by the code renewability framework. **\(R6\)**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact on performance of existing business** 

 The Code Renewability framework research **\(R1\)** and software **\(S4\)** have been applied by Kudelski \(market\-leader in security services for digital TV\) for their production architecture to protect their video\-players. According to a Senior Product Manager at Kudelski IoT, since 2017 the has increased the security of their apps on Android devices without penalizing performances: 

 “We have been able to adapt the ASPIRE software to our platform and the contribution of Paolo’s team helped us addressing the challenge of dynamically updating crypto\-libraries in our digital TV products, deployed across the globe in around 200 million devices today” **\(S1\)**. 

 Thales has used the Code Renewability framework together with a trusted enclave for an early release in 2017 of the Alicem application, used by the French government to authenticate citizens through their mobile phones **\(S2\)**. 

 Kudelski and Thales used the result of our qualitative analysis **\(R5\)** on their tiger\-team reports to improve the security of their products, and Thales also applied the attack modelling methodology **\(R4\)** for their own applications **\(S2\).** 

 **Impact on business technology** 

 The research on combining protections in the ASPIRE Toolchain **\(S5\)**, since 2017 has been extended into a software protection suite both by NAGRA\-Kudelski and Thales. 

 The CTO of Software Monetization at Thales declared that: 

 *“Our current Software Protection Suite is an essential building block securing a customer base of several thousand independent software vendors protecting billions of Euro of their revenue”* **\(S2\)** 

 while the Senior Product Manager at Kudelski IoT stated: 

 *“The Kudelski Obfuscation Product \(KOP\) is used for protecting Kudelski products in both Digital TV as IOT since 2012 and is since 2016 also commercialized for protecting third\-party applications. The technology that has been developed in the ASPIRE project has partly been integrated into the KOP toolchain and is generating multiple millions of revenues on a yearly basis to the Kudelski Group”* **\(S1\)**. 

 WeconStudio, since 2019, have been able to adapt the ASPIRE protections to make them work on IoT devices and, from then, all the security\-sensitive parts have been protected with ASPIRE toolchain protections **\(S3\)**. 

 **Impact on Police investigation practice in the UK and Overseas** 

 Al\-Nemrat helped to improve the digital forensics methods of the London Metropolitan Police. According to the force’s Head of Digital Forensics: 

  

 *“The developed tool increased greatly the speed of investigations, by around 50% and reviewing images without the need to look at the actual source images. It also had a positive impact on the investigators’ mental health and wellbeing by reducing the amount of images viewed by circa 65%”* **\(S7\)**. 

 In 2016, Al\-Nemrat was invited to the EU Network and Information Security \(ENISA\) Workshop and the participants produced the security requirements report for Digital Service Providers \(DSPs\) **\(S8\)**, in which he contributed to the debate about mandatory incident notification for digital service providers. 

 In 2018, the Head of Information Assurance of the Portuguese National Security Cabinet reached out for assistance to shape their confidential strategy and policies for cyberwarfare that led to the adoption of new policy orientations **\(S9\)**. 

 Al\-Nemrat helped with cybercrime training police in Saudi Arabia and Algeria and his research on Incident Response Framework \(IRF\) **\(R6\)**, was the cornerstone of a comprehensive IRF for the UAE authorities **\(S10\)** that led in 2018 to the invitation by the UAE Ministry of Interior office to discuss and improve the cybercrime victimization policy and service pervision in UAE. 

 **Wider impact and public awareness** 

 All the software developed by UEL in ASPIRE is open\-source and freely available **\(S4\)** as part of the ASPIRE toolchain **\(S5\).** A YouTube channel \[F\] was created with thirty demonstration videos of all the ASPIRE protections, reaching more than 10,000 views worldwide. 

 Falcarin created the International workshop on Software Protection \(SPRO\), co\-chairing two editions and reaching more than 40 participants from industry in each edition. 

 The ASPIRE challenge in summer 2016 reached more than 900 users in three months, from more than 20 countries \(Figure 1\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Around 650,000 people in the UK suffer from compulsive gambling behaviours. Research from UEL has transformed our understanding of why some people are especially vulnerable to gambling addiction, and informed UK government’s landmark 2019 decision to reduce Fixed Odds Betting Terminals stakes from GBP100 to GBP2. This research has contributed to multiple reports from Public Health England and policymakers, and directly educated local councils, charities and gamblers themselves. In particular, it has improved treatment and support services for problematic gamblers throughout the UK. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The repercussions of gambling as a behavioural addiction can include mental health problems, financial crises, relationship breakdown, domestic violence and self\-harm or suicide. Research conducted by the Drugs and Addictive Behaviours Research Group \(DABRG\) at UEL has played a key role in understanding gambling as an addictive behaviour, by raising awareness of how and why some individuals are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of gambling addiction than others. 

  

 The research began in 2012 in a collaboration with the sole UK residential treatment provider for individuals with gambling problems, the *Gordon Moody Association* \(GMA\). This led to a research project examining GMA client data from 2000 to 2015, which provided a novel integrated analysis of specialist residential treatment for gamblers. The study identified that a shift in recent years towards the use of online gambling and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals \(FOBTS\) amongst men seeking help for gambling addiction \( **R1**\). The client data showed increases over time in the number of gamblers attempting suicide, along with increases in the number of clients reporting anxiety and mental health disorders \( **R2**\). The research revealed that clients who started gambling early in life were more likely to show more severe problematic gambling in adulthood, along with increased illicit substance use and other criminal behaviour. 

  

 The research provided the largest analysis to date in the UK that examines the links between gambling and violence, by surveying 3025 young UK adult males with gambling addiction \( **R3**\). The study demonstrated strong links between problematic gambling and violent behaviours; significantly, it showed that these links also extended to non\-problem gambling. 

  

 Other research from the group has further examined how and why vulnerable populations are susceptible to gambling related harm, by focusing on homeless populations.  The 2017 study indicated that the prevalence of disordered gambling is 11.6% amongst the homeless population as opposed to 0.7% in the general population \( **R4**\). It showed that gambling is a common risk factor contributing to homelessness. Nevertheless, the research found that gambling disorders were often overlooked by homeless services and that support services are often inadequate. A 2019 study examined how GPs can better identify gambling disorders among their patients, who are often reluctant to disclose when gambling has become problematic \( **R5**\). The study identified problems that GPs experience in referring affected patients to appropriate services. 

  

 The group’s work continues to investigate vulnerable populations and gambling. In 2019 the first ever systematic study \( **R6**\) of exposure to gambling and alcohol advertising in English football matchday programmes identified children as a vulnerable population, being targeted by gambling advertising. It showed that gambling marketing was present in 59% of children’s specific programme sections.

 **Informing direct changes in UK public policy on gambling** 

  

 The Drugs and Addictive Behaviours Research Group’s \(DABRG\) research on residential treatment for problem gamblers featured prominently in an *All\-Party Parliamentary Group* report on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and was included in the subsequent report in January 2017 \( **S1**\) which concluded that Fixed Odds Betting Terminals \(FOBTS\) transgressed the core harm prevention principles of the Gambling Act 2005. Following 2018 seminar, policy makers and members of the group submitted a report to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport \(DCMS\) detailing their findings \( **S2**\). Consequently, the DCMS instigated a widely publicised policy change to reduce the maximum stake size for Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, which were labelled \( **S1**\) as the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling. The decision was hailed by the then Culture Secretary, Jeremy Wright, as a “significant step forward in protecting vulnerable people.” 

  

 In addition, the group has contributed to a report based on their research into the links between suicide and gambling for the legal team who are preparing a bill which will allow coroners to collect data on those who die by suicide and who are affected by gambling\-related harm \( **S3**\). 

  

 **Policy debate stimulated by research** 

  

 The group contributed expert advice to a private inquiry session by the *All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Gambling Related Harm* on the 8 May 2019 into the damage caused by online gambling \( **S4**\). The subsequent report reflects key recommendations made by Sharman that the treatment of gambling addiction should be part of the NHS remit. The group’s research featured heavily in the House of Lords Select Committee report on gambling harm released in July 2020. With DABRG being the only UK research group providing evidence on gambling in football match day programmes, their findings underpinned the report’s recommendations on ending gambling advertising in football programming. The changes put forward by these reports have far\-reaching implications for the gambling sector. They have been credited with directly informing government policy and leading to new plans for an overhaul of gambling legislation \( **S5**\). 

  

 **Informing and changing clinical practice at Gordon Moody Association** 

  

 The close partnership with the gambling treatment providers *Gordon Moody Associates* has been recognised in public fora such as the *GMA* annual trustees’ meetings at the House of Commons, in their annual reports and on their own social media. For example, full presentations of data from **R2**, **R3** and **R5** from a *GMA* and stakeholders meeting in January 2018 at UEL are on their public website \( **S6**\).  The findings of the research have improved how GMA delivers their support system by tailoring their review process in their implementation plan. This has included using Sharman’s finding to identify key risks to retention of patients helping them to reduce the numbers who do not complete treatment. As a result, the research supports over 100 people in residential treatment and counselling programmes annually. \( **S7**\) 

  

 **Informing health professionals, the gambling industry and the wider public about gambling related harm among vulnerable populations** 

  

 Beyond their direct influence on policymakers’ discussion and debate, key findings from the studies have informed and enhanced broader public engagement with these issues, and contributed to a change in public perception of problematic gambling as a public health concern. 

  

 The link between gambling and violence \( **R1**\) received extensive coverage in UK national newspapers such as The Times \( **S8**\) and significant international science and industry online news providers. Sharman contributed to a BBC Panorama documentary exploring gambling, which averaged over 3 million viewers in the UK, both as an advisor to the programme makers and as an expert participant in the documentary itself \( **S9**\). This contributed to changes in public perception about gambling, and to increased awareness of the dangers of problematic gambling behaviours amongst friends and family. 

  

 The group’s recent research on gambling advertising has also raised awareness of how children are particularly vulnerable to detrimental effects of gambling addiction and are being targeted in football match day programmes. The results garnered widespread media attention, with the findings on children’s exposure to football gambling adding to the controversy over the bet365 and FA Cup streaming deal in January 2020 \( **S10**\). The media attention led to the Betting Council announcing that the deal would be dropped.

 Human papillomavirus \(HPV\), a common sexually transmitted infection, which has no treatment, causes \~5% of cancers \(e.g., cervical, anal, oropharyngeal\). Since 2008, the UK has offered HPV vaccination to girls, and, after much lobbying, to boys from Sept 2019. Sherman’s programme of research, developed with clinicians and charities, contributed to the government’s u\-turn over gender neutral HPV vaccination and underpins European guidance. It has informed healthcare professional \(HCP\) education, leading to the revision of Public Health England \(PHE\) materials and has been used to educate the public about HPV through media engagement and informing charity and health authority communication strategy.

 Sherman, Senior Lecturer and academic lead for the School of Psychology’s Health and Wellbeing Research Group \(HWB\), has conducted research into issues surrounding knowledge about HPV and related conditions for the past 9 years. HWB promotes collaborative research: members work with clinicians, charity representatives, academics, and patients, both nationally and internationally. Sherman’s work focuses on how improving knowledge in HCPs, parents of teenage children, and women can increase engagement with vaccination and screening. 

 The underpinning research emerged during a highly charged political debate in the UK about extending HPV vaccination to boys. Simultaneously, the NHS cervical screening programme \(NHSCSP\) piloted, then rolled out, HPV testing as primary screening to replace cytology \(examining cervical cells for pre\-cancerous changes\). Sherman’s research provided a solid evidence base on public and HCP knowledge about HPV and attitudes towards these changes to inform communication and implementation. It continues to inform the roll\-out of gender\-neutral vaccination across Europe. 

  

 <ins>HPV and HPV Vaccination:</ins> 

 Sherman’s Wellcome\-funded study in PLOS ONE \( **3.1**\) demonstrated: a\) only 50% of parents sampled have heard of HPV, and only 50% have heard of the HPV vaccine, b\) before receiving information about the vaccine most of the 50% who had heard of it wanted it to be available for boys, c\) after brief information was provided to the entire cohort \(including those who had not previously heard of it\) most parents thought the vaccine should be extended to boys. This was the first UK study to find out what parents know about HPV and males and what they think about HPV vaccination for boys. It was influential because it demonstrated public demand for a vaccine but simultaneously a lack of public knowledge about the health consequences of HPV for males. 

 Sherman and Leicester NHS Trust colleagues published a systematic review exploring what European adolescents know about HPV and HPV vaccination \( **3.2**\). Knowledge about both HPV and the vaccination was suboptimal. Boys know less than girls, which has implications for engagement with gender\-neutral HPV vaccination as it is introduced across Europe. 

  

 <ins>HPV and cervical screening:</ins> 

 Working with gynaecological oncologists from Royal Stoke and Leicester NHS Trusts, and an epidemiologist from King’s College London, Sherman pitched to and published an article in the BMJ highlighting that 20% of new cervical cancer diagnoses and 50% of deaths in the UK are women aged 65\+ who are past the eligible age for cervical screening \( **3.3**\). This article attracted considerable attention nationally and internationally. 

  

 Sherman, alongside colleagues at Leicester NHS Trust, Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust \(Jo’s Trust\), and in New Zealand, conducted a series of surveys \( **3.4**, **3.5**\) to understand what HCPs know about HPV, HPV vaccination, and changes to the NHSCSP. The findings consistently reveal that while basic knowledge is satisfactory, gaps in knowledge exist, particularly regarding changes to the NHSCSP and knowledge of the health consequences of HPV for males. The main UK study \( **3.4**\) recruited 643 HCPs who had previously contacted Jo’s Trust and has been used to inform Jo’s Trust advocacy work and update PHE training materials.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Sherman’s research has generated impact benefiting HCPs and the public by informing and influencing key partners involved in HPV vaccination and screening, including: PHE, Jo’s Trust and HPV Action. Impact has been achieved through inclusion in national and international materials and guidance documents, invited practitioner workshops and talks, and media engagement. 

1.  **Shaping government policy and decision making, UK, Europe, New Zealand** 

 <ins>HPV Vaccination:</ins> 

 The European Cancer Organisation \(ECCO, 2019\) stated that “By 2030, gender\-neutral vaccination programmes against the HPV infection should be in place in all European countries”. Sherman’s research forms part of the evidence used to encourage governments to meet this goal. 

 In 2018, after 5 years of evidence gathering, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation \(JCVI\) advised the UK Government to extend the school\-based HPV vaccination programme to boys and the Government agreed. **3.1** findings were submitted to the public phase of the JCVI consultation and Peter Baker, Campaign Director of HPV Action, who spearheaded the successful campaign for gender\-neutral vaccination, confirms **3.1** “formed a significant part of the evidence base underpinning this policy change” **\(5.1\).**  The vaccination is estimated to benefit 400,000 boys annually. 

 Currently, 17 countries in Europe lack gender\-neutral HPV vaccination. In 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control published guidance about gender\-neutral and nonavalent HPV vaccination citing **3.2** as evidence **\(5.2\).** 

 <ins>Cervical Screening:</ins> 

 Based on **3.6**, a New Zealand National Cervical Screening Programme \(NCSP\) report recommended that the NCSP continue to monitor cancer incidence trends in women under 30, with an emphasis on “engaging women with a high coverage rate at age 25” **\(5.3\).** 

1.  **Improving HCP knowledge** 

 <ins>HPV and HPV Vaccination:</ins> 

 Following **3.3**, Nursing in Practice \(circulation:12,000\), commissioned an article with learning points about HPV from Sherman **\(5.4\).** Sherman gave an invited gender\-neutral HPV vaccination workshop at the 2019 School and Public Health Nurses Association conference. Greater Manchester Health & Social Care Partnership \(GMHSCP\) invited Sherman to present at their Universal HPV vaccination launch event **\(5.5\).** 80\-100% of respondents from each event said they had/intended to use the information to inform their own practice and to disseminate the information further. 

 **3.4** was cited as underpinning evidence for a call to improve public and professional awareness and education about HPV in a major report by ECCO urging action to reduce the annual 87,000 HPV\-related cancers across 50 countries **\(5.6\).** 

 <ins>HPV and cervical screening:</ins> 

 Jo’s Trust use **3.4** to advocate for and deliver training to HCPs **\(5.7\)** and PHE used **3.4** to update smear taker online training materials \(see screenshot\). 



1.  **Raising public awareness and improving understanding** 

 PHE \(2017\) seeks to halt declining cervical screening numbers and protect against future fluctuations in HPV vaccination. Public knowledge and awareness about HPV, vaccination, and screening are important to ensure optimal engagement with the programmes. A campaign of media activity \(2015\-2020\) has led to Sherman’s research being disseminated to over 20 million people **\(5.9\)** and it has informed NHS and charity communications. 

 <ins>HPV and HPV Vaccination:</ins> 

 **3.1** informed development of the GMHSCP communication strategy for the expansion of the HPV vaccine programme to boys **\(5.5\)** and informed Jo’s Trust’s interactions with the 4 nations’ national screening programmes to advocate for language around gender\-neutral vaccination **\(5.7\).** Following **3.1**, Peter Baker \(HPV Action\) invited Sherman onto the expert advisory group which helped develop the website launched to inform the public about male HPV vaccination **\(5.1\).** 

 A Conversation article **\(5.8\)** about **3.1** received 7,082 readers, 23 comments, 70 retweets, 247 Facebook shares, was republished by Medical Xpress, and Radio Stoke \(weekly audience 121,000\) interviewed Sherman about the research. Following publication of **3.4** and the announcement of universal HPV vaccination, further media interviews took place **\(5.9\).** Social media activity around Sherman’s publications indicate considerable reach. **3.1:** 82 tweets from 59 users, reach\-404,522; **3.2:** 42 tweets from 22 users, reach\-58,915 \(Altmetric\). 

 <ins>HPV and cervical screening:</ins> 

 **3.3** received extensive national and international media coverage during Cervical Screening Awareness Week, including the Today Programme, Woman's Hour, BBC 5 Live \(combined daily listeners: 8 million\), national print newspapers including the Metro, Daily Mirror, i, Daily Express, Independent, Telegraph, Times, frontpage of The Scotsman \(combined daily readership, 2015: 3.3 million\) **\(5.9\),** and a BBC Breakfast Show interview **\(5.9\)**. There were 40\+ pieces of regional coverage, international coverage in 14\+ countries and the BMJ identified it as one of their biggest stories of 2015 **\(5.10\).** Jo’s Trust confirmed that **3.3** significantly amplified their own awareness campaign and has been influential in focusing a spotlight on the issue of cervical screening for older women **\(5.7\).**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The dynamics of interpersonal conversation are frequently undervalued factors in intercultural communication training and commercial communication tools. While most intercultural training approaches rely on national stereotypes and outwardly visible features of culture, Dr Doris Dippold’s *FutureLearn* Massive Online Open Course \(MOOC\) focuses on the linguistic dimension. Impact has been realised through the use of these concepts to underpin the design and delivery of intercultural training curricula by intercultural coaches. Professionals working across linguistic and cultural boundaries have used the MOOC’s reflection and planning tools to change their intercultural understanding and effectiveness. Dippold’s language\-led approach has also been used by a technology company to enhance the design of a digital sales chatbot by optimising its prompt:response patterns. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research underpinning the impact described here challenges prevailing ideas in the field of intercultural communication and business communication which do not sufficiently acknowledge the dynamic nature of communication. It draws on ideas and concepts from interactional sociolinguistics and English as a *lingua franca*. 

  

###  Strand 1: Language in Higher Education \(HE\) 

 This strand of research focuses on language in linguistically and culturally diverse university classrooms and issues of oracy \(speaking\) in higher education. Dippold’s research used interviews with first\-year students to investigate the role of language in mediating group interaction and in developing practices which allow flexible thinking and the challenging of stereotypes. This research concluded that all students and staff – international and home – should be taught language strategies to accommodate and negotiate meaning **\[R1\]**. At a macro\-level, HE institutions should avoid focusing on the linguistic deficiencies of non\-native speakers to encourage more inclusive language use and to foster/facilitate effective communication across linguistic and cultural boundaries **\[R2\]**. In addition, Dippold’s research also compared feedback practices in an Accounting and an English for Academic Purposes classroom. The research revealed that differences in these practices can be explained by disciplinary orientations on one hand, and on the other by tutors’ varying perspectives on how explicitly feedback needs to be provided to be effective in a classroom environment characterised by the linguistic diversity of its students **\[R3\]**. In addition, it showed how tutors can master interactional challenges in the linguistically diverse classroom through reflection **\[R4\].** Dippold concluded that all members of the classroom community, including tutors, home and international students, need to be equipped with the skills for using language as a tool for learning and teaching in an international educational environment **\[R3\]**. 

 Drawing on these insights, Dippold also investigated policy and practice in supporting teachers and students to develop these skills and identified a severe need for support centred on language and the dynamics of interpersonal communication in learning and teaching contexts. These findings led to the development of an experiential intercultural training model which places language, and reflection on the nuances of individual language use at the centre of developing intercultural competences **\[R5\]**. Originally intended for beneficiaries in higher education \(tutors and students\), Dippold used this model to develop a *Futurelearn* MOOC for a wider group of professionals working in linguistically and culturally diverse environments. The course, entitled “Communicating with Diverse Audiences”, does not rely on national stereotypes like standard intercultural training initiatives and empowers individuals to improve their communication skills through reflection aided by audio\- and video\-recordings. 

  

###  Strand 2: The language of chatbots 

 In this innovation project, which also stems from Dippold’s expertise in communicative interaction, Dippold and Lynden \(then School of Psychology, Surrey, now Open University\), supported an industrial partner, Account Management Online Limited \(AMO\) – a company that deploys a bot in a range of commercial and service settings – to optimise the language of the bot’s service exchanges. The aim was to allow the bot to sustain longer dialogues, encourage completion of the exchange, prevent feelings of constraints and interrogation and make the bot pleasant to interact with. 

 Much of the research in the field of interactions between humans and computers focuses on investigating how discrete variables influence and change individual behaviour and on individuals’ subjective understanding of features of interaction. Dippold and Lynden used a micro\-analytical approach drawing on concepts from applied linguistics and social psychology to show how nuances of language use can make users feel better aligned with the machine, and how these features can enhance trust and thus increase the chance of a service interaction leading to a sale or a successful lead **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research outlined in Section 2 has led to three strands of impact, all of which draw on Dippold’s language\-led approach which perceives of communication as a dynamic and negotiated phenomenon. 

  

###  1. Enhancing intercultural understanding and effectiveness of professionals 

 Dippold’s experiential training model, implemented in the *Futurelearn* MOOC “Communicating with Diverse Audiences”, has enhanced the intercultural understanding and effectiveness of professionals in a wide range of fields, including most prominently Business, Consulting and Management, the Public Sector, and Teaching and Education **\[S1\]**. The MOOC implements Dippold’s experiential approach using role\-plays education materials that inspire reflection on the nuances of individual language use. It has had a global reach, having been joined by approximately 7,080 individuals in 153 countries, including many developing nations **\[S2\]**. For its public launch in January 2020, the course was selected by the British Council for its ‘Study UK’ campaign and it also featured in the new campaign starting in October 2020. 

 The MOOC has received reviews of an average of 4.7/5, with no ratings under 4 to date \(8/10/2020\). In the *Futurelearn* course survey **\[S3\]**, more than 90% of participants said that they had acquired new skills or knowledge by taking the course and approximately 60 percent of respondents reported that they had applied what they had learned, or had passed on what they had learned, to others. The course has also generated income for the University through certificate sales of approximately £1,068 up to 31 October 2020. 

  

 Participants’ commenting on the ‘impact on practice’ survey **\[S1\]** and on learning steps within the course **\[S4\]** said that role\-play examples and reflection tools, had allowed them to develop strategies for communicating more effectively with speakers from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds and enabled them to make informed decisions about their communication practices: *“ **I am planning to use the self\-evaluation and planning tool to develop my communication skills at work and with others**”* **\[S1\]**. 

  

 Participants also describe how the course had encouraged them to reflect on their own language use, how it enabled them to plan more effective communicative strategies and how it inspired them to critically evaluate processes in the interest of fairness and equality. For example, one learner said that the course would help them to design a fairer interview process: *“ **I work for a crafts charity \[…\]. I find it difficult to interview non\-native speakers as the other panellists don’t seem to want to listen or adapt their language to them \[…\]. We could have missed out on some great Makers because of the language barrier, I think this course will make me a better interviewer in those cases but now I just need the confidence to speak up. I will be bringing the tools with me and reflecting on our interview process**.”* **\[S1\]** 

  

###  2.  Influencing the design and delivery of intercultural training curricula 

 Dippold’s approach, conveyed through the MOOC and a Society for Intercultural Education Training and Research \(SIETAR\) workshop in London in March 2019 which was attended by more than 20 participants with a background in intercultural training / coaching and English Language teaching **\[S5\]**, has influenced the design and delivery of intercultural training curricula. For example, intercultural trainer Jo Bloxham, an attendee at the SIETAR workshop, began concorporating some of the materials into training sessions delivered to her clients to support them in reflecting on what helps and hinders communication. She has so far deployed the materials with approximately 120 participants. Dippold’s work provided Bloxham with the evidence base for a shift from essentialist approaches, which are perceived with growing discomfort by some teachers, towards language\-based approaches to intercultural communication **\[S6a\].** Similarly, language coach Ana Sanchez \(Madrid\) used Dippold’s MOOC to provide the theoretical underpinning for her teaching approach. She found that her enabling focus on ‘fluency and communicative efficiency’ was well\-supported by the MOOC **\[S6b\]**. 

  

 Teachers and intercultural trainers and coaches participating in the MOOC praised the value of the reflective approach and the education materials featured within the course, such as the tools aiding planning of interactions for teaching and coaching practice. For example, one participant commented that *“ **I have suggested improvements to our cultural understanding training so will put forward new ideas created from this course whilst developing the replacement course. Step back from awareness, have an action plan for how to do this in general etc**”* **\[S1\]**. 

  

 John Twitchin, Director of the influential BBC ‘Crosstalk’ series \[CROSSTALK. John Twitchin \(Director\), BBC 1979\], which in 1979 first discussed issues in interracial relationships from a communication perspective, has confirmed that Dippold’s work has added an important new angle to a language\-led approach to intercultural communication, inciting reflection on the status of different varieties of English and of how personal language use may contribute to \(in\)equality **\[S7\]**. 

  

 Based on her research and expertise in intercultural communication training, Doris was invited to speak as an expert at a House of Lords roundtable on ‘Language skills and intercultural understanding for UK businesses working with China’. Dippold argued that learning a language to a level which allows for fluent communication is not realistic in all circumstances and should thus be replaced with training for communication through English as a *lingua franca* which includes awareness of individual communicative practices and their consequences. The advice was heard by several influential professionals and policymakers, including the Chinese Embassy, the Department of International Trade, the China\-Britain Business Council and Industry representatives, including HSBC and Eversheds **\[S8\]**. 

  

 **3. Enhancing the design of a digital sales chatbot** 

 In the summer of 2019, Dippold was invited by local SME AMO \(Account Management Online Limited\) to support them in enhancing the design of their AI driven, automated marketing chatbot to improve customer engagement, enjoyment and trust. In collaboration with Lynden, a psychologist, Dippold developed a new analytical approach drawing on interactional sociolinguistics to derive recommendations for new prompt:response patterns. 

 AMO used these recommendations to implement product design changes to their commercial chatbot by authoring new prompt:response turns which optimise customer trust and engagement, confirming that *“ **critical to the dialogue management strategy is the use of face and politeness theory that was introduced to us during our collaboration**”* **\[S9\]**. In addition, Dippold and Lynden’s recommendations have informed the redesign of AMO’s chatbot interface which now allows user\-initiated questions and clarification requests. These design changes represent a significant step\-change compared to competitor technologies. In addition, this work has subsequently also supported a successful application for new investment funding from Innovate UK \(£300,000\) with the help of *the “ **refined conversation patterns presented in our application.”** \[S9\]** 

  

 AMO’s new bot, which uses the design changes to conversation patterns proposed by Dippold and Lynden, has been deployed to other companies, including a packaging solutions company and the SETSquared partnership. The SETSquared Operations and Relationship Manager has reported that the deployment of an effective bot has been successful in qualifying out investors and/or companies who do not fit the investment club’s criteria, saving vital time in the process **\[S10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by Dr Antonis Alexandridis of Kent Business School in 2016 for Eurobank Property Services \(a leading Greek and Romanian mortgage lender\) resulted in an automatic mass valuation system for the real estate sector. The new tool was implemented by Eurobank Property Services in relation to its mortgage valuations from 2016 onwards, and helped reduce the risk of non\-performing loans \(i.e. those with property as collateral\). The tool was also used by the Greek Ministry of Finance and the European Commission to objectively define the value of real\-estate properties in Greece and to inform the tax rate applied to individual properties. The introduction of the system resulted in a range of efficiencies for the bank and cost savings for its clients. 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The need for objective and systematic assessment of real\-estate property values has always been important. This need became all the more essential following the Eurozone crisis in 2014, when EU countries started exiting bailout programmes and banks needed extra assurances on the value of properties before issuing mortgages, to help reduce the proportion of non\-performing loans.  Governments require similar information, before they can set annual property tax rates. As a result, banks, lenders, and government bodies need to find ways to provide fast and accurate real\-estate valuations at frequent intervals. However, in countries such as Greece and Romania, property markets are in their infancy. Financial institutions see them as inefficient, non\-homogeneous, and governed by a consistent lack of information. This presents significant challenges to the accurate valuation of real\-estate property in these national contexts. 

 Alexandridis’ expertise lies in the areas of mathematical modelling and forecasting. Together with Professor Zapranis Achilleas of the University of Macedonia, he developed a statistical methodology for modelling real\-world problems using wavelet neural networks in the context of financial applications **\[R1, R2\]**. This enabled him to address the problem of real\-estate valuation in non\-homogenous, newly developed markets by developing an automatic mass valuation system \(referred to variously as AMVS or AMV in the documentation cited in this case study\) **\[R3, R4\]**. The model used a large database of historical prices from Greece, Romania, and Serbia to obtain accurate property valuations for these markets. Alexandridis’ research applied a non\-linear automatic valuation method based on an optimised machine\-learning technique or neural network. This method forecasts real\-estate prices based on characteristics found in hedonic indexes. 

 Alexandridis worked in collaboration with two senior managers of Eurobank Property Services, Dr Dimitrios Papastamos \(Head of Research and Analytics Division\) and Dimitrios Andritsos \(Chief Executive Officer\). With their input, Alexandridis built a three\-layer neural network –consisting of an ‘input variables’ layer, a ‘hidden units’ layer, and an ‘outputs layer’. The novelty of this method stemmed from the use of a black\-box model that was presented with a training and a validation sample. The use of this training\-validation combined sample helped Alexandridis to select the appropriate number of hidden units, and to identify the statistically significant variables for real\-estate valuation purposes. These regularisation methods fine\-tuned the neural network to avoid the over\-fitting of the method to a given sample, which would have rendered it invalid for other datasets. The use of these techniques in this project \(and across Alexandridis’ previous research\) to avoid over\-fitting has proven to be an especially innovative approach, which improves the accuracy of real\-world predictions and outperforms other standard valuation methods such as MRA or SMV **\[R1, R2, R3\]**. 

 The results of Alexandridis’ research with Eurobank Property Services indicated that the proposed method **\[R3\]** outperformed the bank’s previous property valuation method by reducing the out\-of\-sample forecasting Mean Square Error \(MSE\) from 21% to 15%. Alexandridis and his collaborators also identified the property characteristics that led to large forecasting errors. The results indicated that the forecasting error increases when the area of the residence exceeds 120m<sup>2</sup>, the property is a house as opposed to a flat, or when a large unbuilt land area is included. Similarly, properties built before 1950 lead to larger forecasting errors, as the conservation status of the properties and alterations it may have undergone have effects on the actual value. However, the analysis by Alexandridis and his collaborators at Eurobank Property Services revealed that neural networks are less sensitive to changes in these characteristics than are other methods. The results indicated that the proposed methodology constituted an accurate tool for property valuation in non\-homogeneous, newly developed markets. The resulting automatic mass valuation system can be adapted in applications such as mortgage quality control or appraisal review, loss mitigation analysis, portfolio valuation, and appraisal process redesign. 

 Findings from this project were published in 2018 in the *Journal of the Operational Research Society* **\[R3\]**, having previously been disseminated at a conference in 2017 **\[R4\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The global financial crisis of 2007, and the following Eurozone crisis of 2009\-14, resulted in a significant decline in house prices in Greece and Romania; as a result, mortgage lenders lost large amounts of capital through defaulted mortgage loans and other non\-performing loans. Following Dr Alexandridis’ consultancy work with Eurobank Property Services in 2016, a new automatic mass valuation system was implemented by financial institutions in Greece and Romania, and also adopted by government departments in Greece and the European Commission to determine taxation thresholds. 

 **Greek Ministry of Finance and European Commission: aiding reform of property taxation in Greece** 

 By 2016, Greek taxpayers were paying seven times more in property tax than in 2009, despite the huge increases in unemployment and drops in living standards following the Eurozone crisis of 2009\-14. According to European Commission figures for 2015, the only EU countries with higher property taxes were France and Britain. Within this context, the Greek Ministry of Finance decided in 2018 to revise its unified property tax, using accurate values to determine property taxation rate intervals. To achieve this **\[a\]**, the Ministry needed accurate data on the current value of each residential property in Greece. In June 2018, the Ministry contracted Eurobank Property Services to conduct a pilot survey of 829 real\-estate zones across the country. This was achieved using the automatic mass valuation system developed by Dr Alexandridis to accurately define the market value of real\-estate properties in the surveyed zones **\[b, c\]**. 

 Following this pilot, Eurobank Property Services won a tender from the European Commission \(in July 2018\) to objectively define the value of real estate in the country’s remaining 10,000 building zones **\[d, e, f\]**. Eurobank Property Services \(by then operating as Cerved Property Services\) continued to use the automatic mass valuation system to carry out annual valuations for the Greek Ministry of Finance and the European Commission to inform the tax rate applied to each property **\[g\]**. 

 **Greece: improving property valuation processes for Eurobank Property Services** 

 The Eurozone crisis left Greek banks with a high proportion of non\-performing loans with real estate as a collateral. This put the financial sector in Greece under considerable strain. Alexandridis’ automatic mass valuation system \(AMV/AMVS\) enabled Eurobank Property Services to better assess the value and risks associated with lending against property and helped reduce running costs through the optimisation of its operations **\[g\]**. 

 More specifically, since 2016, Eurobank Property Services \(now Cerved Property Services\) has used Alexandridis’ automatic mass valuation system to: 

-  Revalue its real\-estate portfolio \(comprising approximately 4,000 loans with real estate as collateral\) twice a year. 

-  Revalue several non\-performing loan portfolios for clients such as Elliott Advisors or Bain Capital. Both organisations used the automatic mass valuation system in 2019 to revalue five non\-performing loan portfolios \(approximately 50,000 properties in total\) owned by three systemic retail banks in Greece. 

-  In 2019 and 2020, more than 5,000 valuations have been reviewed by external appraisers using the automatic mass valuation system as a substitute for manual reviewing processes **\[g\]**. 

 In summary, the automatic mass valuation system has improved the company’s forecasting and valuation methods from 2015 onwards. This was achieved through a 6% reduction in forecasting errors \(from 21% to 15% **\[R3\]**\), as well as through reducing the time required to conduct valuations on this scale. **\[g\]**. As Cerved Property Services’ Head of Research and Analytics Division, explained: ‘Every individual \(AMV\) exercise required the commitment of max 2 FTEs for an average period of 2 weeks. The alternative being desktop valuation reports practically would be a blocking factor for CPS’s valuation division, since will be required 10 FTEs for 6 months to complete the above projects on time.’ **\[g\]** 

 **Romania: improving the valuation practices of leading mortgage lenders** 

 The successful application of the automatic mass valuation system in Greece led Eurobank \(Romania\), Eurobank Property Services \(Romania\), and Bancpost S.A. \(Romania\) to adopt the same approach from 2015 onwards. Given the specific challenges and characteristics presented by the Romanian housing market, Alexandridis adapted the system accordingly **\[h\]**. 

 Introducing a new version of the automatic mass valuation system enabled Eurobank Property Services to perform mass revaluations of very large residential portfolios in a more cost\- and time\-effective manner. The company carried out four mass revaluation exercises involving approximately 20,000 residential collaterals between 2015 and 2018. Achieving this using the previous manual, desktop approach would have occupied the entire valuation department \(seven full\-time employees\) for 16 months. By using Alexandridis’ automatic mass valuation system, each of these exercises occupied just two employees over an average period of three weeks. In addition, using the system reduced the verification time of a valuation report by approximately 0.5 days on average **\[i\]**. The system was also deployed in real time to check valuations from professional real\-estate valuators and to minimise fraud **\[i\]**. 

 **Benefiting clients** 

 From the perspective of Eurobank/Cerved Property Services’ clients, the utilisation of the automatic mass valuation system has led to significant cost savings. The use of this tool meant that valuations carried out using the automatic mass valuation system \(AMV\) are, according to standard banking costs fees, five times cheaper than the alternative desktop valuation approach **\[g\]**. As the General Manager of Eurobank Property Services in Romania stated: ‘From the bank’s/client’s perspective the utilization of statistical tools – including AMV – has led to a significant cost saving impact. Indicatively we can refer to the 4 \[…\] exercises of approx. 20,000 collaterals. The cumulative fee for these projects was roughly €130,000 while assuming that the same projects would be performed in a desktop approach and in accordance with the agreed fee lists the overall cost would reach €780,000, roughly 5 times more than the actual fees paid.’  **\[i\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 ‘Land Lines: British Nature Writing, 1789–2014’, a collaborative research project funded by the AHRC \(2017\-19\), produced impacts in three key areas: \(1\) increased engagement with nature writing; \(2\) developed amateur nature writers; and \(3\) deepened public engagement with and concern for the natural world. Two follow\-on projects, also AHRC\-funded, centred on two of Natural England’s nature reserves, Lower Derwent Valley and Humberhead Peatlands, and Castle Howard Estate, a national cultural heritage site. These led to a fourth impact: extended opportunities for access to the natural world, which has improved public awareness of, and involvement in, local and national conservation initiatives amongst schoolchildren and older adults. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Funded by the AHRC **\[RG1\]**, ‘Land Lines’ encompassed three University of Leeds researchers – PI Professor Graham **Huggan**, Co\-I Professor David **Higgins,** and PDRA Dr Pippa **Marland** – alongside two other researchers **,** Dr Will Abberley \(University of Sussex\) and Dr Christina Alt \(University of St Andrews\). 

 The research aims were to explore how nature writing has changed over the last two hundred years or so, and to see what contemporary examples might reveal about our relationship with the natural world today, particularly in the contexts of global warming and rapid biodiversity loss. More specifically, the research involved a pioneering critical investigation of modern British nature writing, from Gilbert White’s seminal study *The Natural History* *of Selborne* \(1789\) to Helen Macdonald’s award\-winning memoir, *H is for Hawk* \(2014\). The investigation was significant in overturning the orthodox Romantic view of nature writing as a *celebratory* form, concerned with giving lyrical voice to the wonder and beauty of nature, arguing instead that it is a quintessentially *conflict\-ridden* form which articulates a linked set of modern crises: environmental crisis, the crisis of representation, the crisis of the alienated self. Also significant was its view of nature writing as an emotionally wrought, intensely *personal* form that reflects individual experiences of nature but, in seeking to share these experiences, opens up opportunities for non\-specialist engagement with an increasingly threatened natural world. 

 **Higgins**’ research, in particular, revealed that Romantic\-period authors were self\-conscious about the inherent problems of representing the natural world in verbal language. Romantic nature memoirs generate a creative tension between writing’s capacity to express the inner self and its capacity to evoke plants and animals through intense observation and description. This tension continues to trouble and inspire authors to this day **\[1\]**. **Huggan** argued in the contemporary context that animal writing, while revealing our \(human\) interdependency with animals, is less likely to reach out to non\-human others than to reveal our otherness to ourselves **\[2\]**. In stressing the importance of modern nature writing as an ecological form involving the complex entanglement of human and non\-human agencies, the project also built on a longstanding body of humanities\-based environmental and human\-animal research at the University of Leeds, represented by **Huggan**, **Higgins** and **Marland.** **Huggan** has published extensively on environmental topics that range from the relationship of the ‘new nature writing’ to earlier literary/cultural traditions, to the rise of today’s animal\-endorsing ‘celebrity conservationists’ **\[3, 4\]**.  **Higgins** has explored how representations of ‘English nature’ in Romantic writing reveal conflicting ideas around personal identity, and how even the most apparently parochial texts are inflected by imperial, global contexts **\[1\]**. 

 **Marland**’s most recent work has exposed the blindness to difference that is a legacy of class\-bound, able\-bodied paradigms of encounters with nature \(e.g. the ‘solitary walker’\), while examining both early and more recent egalitarian alternatives **\[5\]**. Finally, through their own reflective writing, interviews and blog posts **\[6\]**, **Huggan, Higgins** and **Marland** have stimulated important public debates around the politics and ethics of nature writing, and human relationships with the natural world. The ‘Land Lines’ website, and particularly its associated blog, have created an informal dialogue with the public, allowing researchers to communicate their findings beyond a traditional academic context in innovative ways, and providing key public platforms for disseminating project research.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research increased engagement with British nature writing and developed amateur nature writers. It also deepened public engagement with the natural world and opened up new opportunities for access to it. 

 **\(i\) Increased engagement with nature writing** 

 The ‘Land Lines’ project aimed to discover what British nature writing means to people, to ask why they read it, and to consider how it might influence the way they think about – and act upon – an increasingly threatened natural world. Given the contemporary democratisation of nature writing – its opening up to an increasing range of writers and readers – it also examined why nature writing is such a popular form today. Between October 2017 and January 2018, the research team collaborated with the AHRC to design and administer an online public poll to find Britain’s favourite nature writer, with **Huggan**’s research on the ‘new nature writing’ **\[3\]** – a modern form of the literature of conscience that responds to the current environmental crisis – feeding directly into it. Most shortlisted writers were contemporary, and the crisis\-ridden nature of their work was noted by many voters and by members of the adjudicating panel, including **Huggan** himself. **Higgins**’ research on nature writing as an autobiographical form also contributed to the poll, which both encouraged and attracted a wide variety of personal responses.  **Marland**’s work on equality and inclusion was also reflected in some of the choices made, including that of the winning author, Chris Packham, who has explicitly linked his autism to his championing of the diversity to be discovered in the natural world. 

 The poll attracted 770 nominations from the public, comprising 278 titles by 213 different writers, and its online reach was matched by a similarly high level of broadcast media coverage, including the BBC Radio 4 Today programme and BBC2’s Winterwatch, resulting in a total reach of over 30 million people **\[A\]**. A shortlist of 10 titles was drawn up and 7300 public votes were cast. The poll’s result was revealed on the BBC2 programme Winterwatch \(31.1.18\) and was subsequently widely reported in local and national press and social media platforms. Two books in particular came to prominence in the poll. The announcement of Chris Packham’s *Fingers in the Sparkle Jar* as the winning publication triggered a 1107% increase in UK customer orders **\[C\]**, generating economic impacts for its publisher, Penguin, and evidence of increased readership. Packham himself acknowledged the value of the poll in recognising his work, observing that ‘until this point, all of the attention on the book was about the Asperger’s. I put an enormous amount more effort into the nature writing than the Asperger’s. I worked really hard on all of the analogies and similes, making sure they were unique, that they were in a style that was novel’ \( *Guardian* 31.1.18\). The book also entered the top 10 best\-selling non\-fiction paperbacks in the UK for the following three weeks \( *Sunday Times* 11.2.18; 18.2.18; 25.2.18\). Packham’s book, a mixed narrative form that shifts time frames and is witty, profound and heart\-breaking all at once, encapsulates project research findings highlighting the complexity of nature writing as a literary form. The poll continues to be used as a marketing tool by publishers Penguin and also by Hutchinson, the publisher of Rob Cowen’s *Common Ground*, which came third. An additional 3000 copies of *Common Ground* were printed in January 2018 alone, and the publisher has since amended the book’s subtitle to reflect its selection in the poll and the media coverage it attracted at the time **\[C\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Developing amateur nature writers** 

 Since the ‘Land Lines’ project began, its website has received over 50,382 views from 138 countries, with 26,884 in 2020 alone. Its blog \( [https://landlines.project.wordpress.com/blog/](https://landlines.project.wordpress.com/blog/)\) has helped to re\-awaken concern for the natural world among a wide range of amateur contributors and emboldened them to express and share their views, many of them for the first time. Reflecting project research by **Marland** among others, that shows that nature writing has always had a demotic strand, the blog has explicitly encouraged non\-specialists to try their hand at nature writing. As one contributor wrote, ‘I had never really thought of myself as a nature writer \[and the blog\] has given me the confidence in my voice in this area of writing’ **\[B\]**. Another asserted that although she had not yet been prompted to do anything differently, contributing to the blog had opened her eyes to the importance of addressing the global environmental crisis, giving her fresh hope of changing things, ‘respecting nature, like indigenous people do, as sacred’, rather than succumbing to resignation or despair **\[B\]**. In keeping with project research by **Higgins** and others that sees nature writing as an important, ethically charged mode of personal self\-expression, the ongoing development of amateur writers through the guest blog has helped participants shape an understanding of their own personal connections to nature and consider their behaviour in relation to it. In line with the aims of the project, the website has also been used more generally as a resource to stimulate nature writing in a wide range of contexts.  This includes supporting emerging nature writers from underrepresented backgrounds in the context of the new Nan Shepherd Prize \( [https://nanshepherdprize.com/resources/what\-is\-nature\-writing/](https://nanshepherdprize.com/resources/what-is-nature-writing/)\), where the ‘Land Lines’ website is cited as a valuable resource. 

 **\(iii\) Deepening public engagement with the natural world** 

 In March 2019, and in partnership with the AHRC and Natural England, the ‘Land Lines’ team orchestrated a crowd\-sourced Spring Nature Diary, which drew 420 entries from across the UK and is estimated to have reached more than 5 million people worldwide via the Twitter \#SpringNatureDiary hashtag **\[A\]**. In an attempt to return nature writing to its popular roots, the initiative revived the democratising format of the personal diary, drawing on **Higgins**’ work on nature memoir and **Marland**’s wide\-ranging research into early forms of non\-specialist nature writing. Entries were made available as a 73\-page e\-book, with some selected for publication in spring 2020 in a book edited by nature writer Abi Andrews. The diary continues to grow, with the 2020 edition attracting even greater media attention: 1433 page views on the blog; a full\-page *Guardian* article \(17.4.20\); coverage on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme; and 61 media mentions reaching a global audience of 23 million **\[A\]**. In 2020 alone, **Marland** was invited to discuss the project’s enduring themes in 19 radio interviews, including for the BBC Radio 3 Free Thinking programme \(July 2020\), and was interviewed for the Danish newspaper Jyllands\-Posten \(20.8.20\) and the US conservation online platform Mongabay \(4.5.20\). Such widespread interest shows nature’s value in the context of the Covid\-19 virus, which has re\-awakened public interest in reconnecting with, but also protecting, the natural world  [https://landlinesproject.wordpress.com/2020/04/17/the\-crowd\-sourced\-diary\-and\-the\-covid\-19\-spring/](https://landlinesproject.wordpress.com/2020/04/17/the-crowd-sourced-diary-and-the-covid-19-spring/). The Spring Nature Diary is now an annual event, hosted by the National Trust, whose Communications Director recently confirmed that the Trust, which is keen to ‘help people access the \[physical and mental\] benefits’ of encounters with nature, is proud to ‘support a lasting legacy of amateur nature writing in the UK’ through continued engagement with the Spring Nature Diary **\[D\]**. 

 **\(iv\) Extending opportunities for access to the natural world** 

 ‘Land Lines’ and its subsequent follow\-on projects reached new audiences through an extensive public engagement programme that offered researchers opportunities to disseminate their findings. In the original project, these included a panel discussion chaired by **Marland** \(23.1.18\) at Redland Library, Bristol \(50\+ audience\); a public talk by **Higgins** \(10.8.17\) outlining his research on Romantic poets’ responses to birds at the Booth Museum, Brighton \(50 participants\); a public reading at Leeds City Library \(28.2.19\) that reflected **Huggan**’s research into contemporary nature writing and the phenomenon of writers focusing on particular iconic animals \(90 participants\); and a sea\-themed family weekend \(14/15.9.17\) at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust’s Living Seas Centre in Flamborough, hosted by **Huggan** and featuring a beach clean\-up by a group of 120 scouts from Barnsley, who would later write about their experiences, and a public reading and children’s workshop, both of them acknowledging **Huggan**’s and **Marland**’s research, by the maritime writer Philip Hoare. 

 Some families attending the sea\-themed workshop subsequently signed up as members of the YWT, while the Living Seas Centre Manager declared an interest in running nature\-writing workshops in the future **\[E\]**. Attendees of the Leeds Library reading stated that the event had inspired them to ‘read more books on nature’, ‘go fearlessly into wild places’, and ‘start a watercolour/nature diary of my local area’ **\[F\]**. The Marketing and Communications Officer confirmed that the reading had ‘helped bring the Leeds Library to a new academic audience’ and had cemented a ‘true partnership between Land Lines, the Leeds Library, and the Leeds Big Bookend’, a local literary festival **\[G\]**. 

 In 2019, **Huggan**, **Higgins** and **Marland** were awarded AHRC follow\-on funding to work with Natural England on a 12\-month project **\[RG2**: October 2019–October 2020, since extended by 3 months as a result of Covid\-19 disruptions **\]**. This project explored ways of encouraging Yorkshire\-based primary schoolchildren and older adults to revive increasingly lost connections with the natural world. Taking **Higgins**’ work on Romantic birdwatching and **Huggan**’s on modern conservation as starting points **,** the project engaged new audiences with the natural world with activities ranging from bird\-tagging and tracking at the Lower Derwent Valley \(LDV\) nature reserve to co\-devised, conservation\-conscious educational materials on birds. These activities provided new experiences of nature \(nocturnal birdwatching, illuminated nature trails\) with demonstrable educational benefits **.** As the Principal of one of the participating schools, Hatfield Woodhouse Primary, Doncaster \(HWP\), remarked, seeing the animals first\-hand at LDV as well as researching them online ‘brought to the children’s attention the dangers of litter to our wildlife. \[The children in\] Year 4 \[were all\] keen to take a more active role in changing this and have taken part in a litter\-pick outside the immediate locality of the school. As a school, we are using the children’s enthusiasm to learn more about the natural world to develop a Forest School area at the bottom of the playing field’ **\[H\]**. Ties to HWP were maintained during the Covid\-19 crisis through artwork featured in ‘Nightjar Nights’ \(June 8–13 2020\), a week\-long programme of virtual events and activities involving British nature writer, Stephen Moss, alongside providing development opportunities for emerging nature writers Sara Hudston and Anita Roy. The programme attracted more than 3000 views on the ‘Land Lines’ website, for which interest peaked during the lockdown months, representing a 150% increase on the previous year. 

 Enthusiasm for the project was shared by Natural England staff at the two participating reserves, LDV and Humberhead Peatlands \(HP\). An illustrated children’s book on the nightjar, *The Mysterious Bird in the Moonlight* \[ISBN 978\-1\-5272\-7829\-5\], co\-produced with the participating schools and now in the process of being commercialised, has become a model that will be copied in other NE reserves, while the educational materials developed together with the schools will be used in other parts of the county. As the LDV Senior Reserve Manager remarked, ‘we are excited by the potential to roll out \[a book series\] across the Yorkshire region’ and have ‘already identified four sites … each featuring an iconic species that could be highlighted in a new book’. Moreover, he said, working together with the ‘Land Lines’ team had generated ‘renewed interest among visitors to our reserves in elusive avian species’, while its greatest benefit had been ‘the multiple opportunities it has given us to fulfil our joint aims to empower old and young alike to learn more about the natural world’ **\[I\]**. 

 A second Yorkshire\-based follow\-on project **\[RG3\]**, equally embedded in ‘Land Lines’ research, is ongoing at the time of submission \(December 2020\), having likewise been given an extension of 3 months. This project revolves around contemporary conservation and land\-use initiatives, with a key role being played by the Castle Howard Estate \(CHE\). The estate, a major cultural heritage attraction, recently committed itself to the rewilding of some of its land and, at the time of writing, former ‘Land Lines’ researchers, notably **Huggan** and **Marland**, are in the process of organising a series of Covid\-delayed art\-based activities designed to draw attention to these new conservation initiatives and the democratising principles on which they are based \(e.g. the idea, explored in **Marland**’s research, that even privately owned land can at least in part be shared\). As with the first follow\-on project, these activities are designed to consolidate conservation work at the estate and other fledgling rewilding sites while also expanding the demographic involved in it. As the Curator of CHE confirmed, ‘\[Our\] collaboration \[with the ‘Land Lines’ team\] has been a valuable opportunity for us to review our contemporary understanding of the estate as \[both\] an amenity and a working landscape’. This has allowed ‘wider audiences to respond to the variety of experiences in the landscape’, while also leading to an enriched awareness of ‘the complementarity between built and natural heritage, \[which\] has been central to our drive for greater public understanding of Castle Howard, past, present and future’ **\[J\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Critically ill patients having long periods of mechanical ventilation are at higher risk of morbidity. The research by Blackwood, McAuley and Clarke identified ways to optimise inter\-disciplinary collaboration in weaning infants and children from mechanical ventilation and, by July 2020, nearly two\-thirds \(18/28\) of UK paediatric intensive care units had adopted the protocolised weaning intervention that was designed based on this research. Without this research and the implementation activities, the approach to ventilator weaning practice in the UK would not be as collaborative or evidence based as it is currently. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Reducing the time that patients in intensive care units \(ICUs\) spend on mechanical ventilation by optimising their weaning from ventilator support is an important patient outcome and a top priority for critical care clinicians. Over recent years, weaning protocols were developed to guide clinicians in this process through encouraging more collaborative working and reducing variation in practice. In the early 2010s, 18% of UK paediatric ICUs had a weaning protocol, compared to 54% and 31% in UK and European adult ICUs, respectively. The relatively low proportion of uptake in paediatric ICUs can be attributed to clinicians’ understanding of, and belief in, the strength of evidence for their effectiveness, as well as the approaches used to introduce these protocols into the practice of ICU clinicians. The work of Blackwood, McAuley and Clarke at Queen’s University Belfast \(QUB\) has tackled these barriers and led to large\-scale change in weaning practice in paediatric ICUs across the UK. 

 Blackwood synthesized research findings on weaning protocols worldwide, showing a clinically significant reduction of 6 hours \(from 134 to 126 hours\) \(based on 260 children in 1 trial\) in duration of mechanical ventilation when protocols were used in paediatric ICUs **\[R1\]** and of 25 hours \(96 to 71 hours\) in adult ICUs \(2205 patients, 14 trials\) **\[R2\]**. This work also highlighted considerable differences in how trial outcomes were measured, impeding the interpretation of this body of research. However, despite the beneficial effects of weaning protocols, there were discordant results among the adult trials, and just the one eligible trial in children. Blackwood explored reasons for the discordant results in a synthesis of 11 qualitative studies of staff views in adult and paediatric ICUs **\[R3\]** and identified facilitators and barriers to clinicians using weaning protocols. These included the extent of clinician experience; inter\-professional hierarchies and collaboration; ICU workload; and user\-friendliness of the protocol. These reasons are often ignored in designing and implementing strategies to improve weaning outcomes and the qualitative evidence synthesis provided evidence\-based foundations for change. 

 The largest gaps in clinical practice related to the need for \(1\) evidence on the effects of weaning protocols in children with a strategy for ensuring successful implementation, and \(2\) agreement by patients, clinicians and researchers on the outcomes that are most important to measure in evaluations of weaning protocols. Blackwood, McAuley, and Clarke’s research helped to fill these gaps. 

 First, a quality improvement weaning protocol for children and an implementation strategy to maximise impact in the NHS was developed. The quality improvement intervention \(Sedation AND Weaning In CHildren: SANDWICH\) was developed following feasibility work with clinicians in 24 NHS paediatric ICUs **\[R4\]**. Blackwood’s assessment of practice in paediatric ICUs showed considerable variation in ventilator weaning practice and limited guidance on management of sedation to optimise readiness for weaning. Very few bedside nurses and junior medical staff were engaged in assessing patients for weaning and managing their weaning. Consequently, weaning was not done overnight and at weekends, and it only happened when consultants were available. This meant that many children were remaining on mechanical ventilation, exposed to its risks, for longer than they needed to be. Through engagement with parents and young people, Blackwood was able to show that the proposed intervention \(which incorporated greater involvement of junior medical and bedside nurses in the weaning process\) was acceptable, and that reducing time on the ventilator was an important outcome for them **\[R5\]**. The paediatric ICU community and the Paediatric Intensive Care Society deemed the SANDWICH intervention as a \#1 priority. In 2018, its implementation across paediatric ICUs in the UK was commissioned by the NHS. 

 Second, Blackwood, McAuley, and Clarke gained international agreement on a core outcome set for ventilation trials and developed one of the first core outcome sets \(COS\) in critical care **\[R6\]**. This development process had international engagement from 27 countries in Europe, North and South America, Australia, Asia and Africa and involved ICU survivors and their carers; nurses, allied health professionals and critical care physicians; clinical trials groups and trial investigators; and industry. Collectively, they agreed the most important outcomes that should be measured in all assessment of mechanical ventilation and this consensus is allowing research designers, practitioners and policy makers to ensure that all future ventilation trials will measure these patient and clinically relevant outcomes in a standardised fashion.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 *Transforming ventilator weaning practice in UK paediatric ICUs* 

 Annually, in the UK, approximately 20,000 infants and children are treated in intensive care and, of these, around 12,000 receive mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation is potentially lifesaving, but it can compromise the child’s comfort, feeding and mobility. Furthermore, it carries risks of vocal cord dysfunction, subglottic stenosis, ventilator\-induced lung injury and nosocomial pneumonia, therefore the sooner children are appropriately weaned, the better their outcomes. Decisions about when they are well enough to come off ventilator support are complex. The SANDWICH intervention, based on the research by Blackwood, McAuley and Clarke, transformed the approach to this key aspect of the care of critically ill children. 

 By early 2018, the feasibility work and broad engagement with the UK paediatric ICU community, led to the SANDWICH quality improvement intervention being commissioned for funding by the NIHR **\[S1\]**. Nearly two\-thirds \(18/28\) of UK paediatric ICUs agreed to come on board with the weaning strategy and implement the SANDWICH intervention with the inter\-disciplinary, collaborative working practices that it entailed. In 2018, 71% \(8129/11390\) of ventilated children, some of the sickest children in the UK, were being cared for in one of the 18 ICUs that had adopted the SANDWICH intervention. From February 2018, each month the clinical staff of one ICU were trained, and they continued to wean from ventilation using the SANDWICH intervention. In total, 83% \(1865/2247\) of staff in 18 ICUs were trained, successfully passed the online course, and delivered the SANDWICH weaning strategy. The success of this quality improvement intervention in changing medical and nursing practice was particularly mentioned by a Consultant in Paediatric Intensive Care from an NHS Cambridge University Hospital **\[S2\]**. By August 2019, 64% \(18/28\) of all NHS PICUs had changed practice and all were weaning children using the SANDWICH intervention. By October 2019 when the trial ended, the number of children weaned using the SANDWICH intervention was 5,646. Results from this trial showed a small, but significant reduction of 5\-9\-hours in duration of mechanical ventilation until successful liberation **\[S3\]**. Furthermore, in an accompanying editorial presented following the presentation of results, the SANDWICH intervention was accredited as an intervention that made a significant impact on patient outcomes **\[S3\]**. 

  

 Since January 2020, the intervention and its materials became available to the remaining 10 PICUs in the UK and by December 2020, one of these have adopted it, with further adoption halted by COVID\-19. The SANDWICH website has provided free access to the SANDWICH intervention and all training materials **\[S4\]**. Since this went live, 1,509 users from 10 countries have downloaded the materials: 35% from the United States and 28% from the UK **\[S5\]**. Furthermore, nearly one\-year on, a follow\-up survey indicated that all participating paediatric ICUs continue to use one or more of the SANDWICH intervention components **\[S6\]**. 

 *Standardisation of outcome measures for mechanical ventilation research* 

 Adoption of all COS are endorsed by the NIHR who recommend that all grant applications include a COS where one is available. As a result of the work of Blackwood, McAuley and Clarke highlighting the inconsistency in outcome measures used in adult and paediatric ventilation trials and the subsequent development of the COS, the COS has achieved 18 citations in trial registries and published papers **\[S7\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Significant solar storms can damage satellites, radio communications, and power grids. Predicting them has been a challenging problem for experts. We developed one of the world’s first automated real\-time systems for the 24/7 monitoring and prediction of extreme solar flares by processing the latest satellite images. ASAP \(Automated Solar Activity Prediction\) is publicly available at  [http://143.53.238.233/asap](http://143.53.238.233/asap). ASAP is working with NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite, integrated into NASA’s online space weather portal, used as a decision\-making tool for NASA’s robotic missions and to manage radiation effects on NASA’s Chandra x\-ray observatory orbit, and is widely acknowledged as an international benchmark. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections \(CMEs\) are solar eruptions that emit vast quantities of radiation and charged particles into space. These events can damage the Earth’s communication and power infrastructure, resulting in power outages and reduced system functionality. Predicting these events to ensure systems and infrastructure are robust has long been a challenging problem for experts. 

 We tackled this problem from an imaging/AI perspective. Between 2005 and 2010, our approach focused on extracting relevant solar features from multi\-wavelength satellite images before feeding them to AI systems trained on years of data, to generate automated solar flare predictions \[1,2,3\]. ASAP was created by integrating the solar imaging module and the solar AI module. ASAP was integrated with NASA’s Community Coordinated Modelling Center \(CCMC\) and became operational in 2010. ASAP was updated in 2011 to support the newly launched Solar Dynamics Observatory \(SDO\) satellite and again in 2016 to improve its prediction accuracy and overall performance. It is still operational 24/7, providing automated web\-compliant real\-time predictions. 

  

 ASAP was also integrated with ESA’s Space Weather European Network \(SWENET\), between 2011 and 2013. SWENET is no longer operational, but to improve launch safety, ESA funded two ASAP updates in 2013 and 2015 to integrate it with the University of Malaga’s \(Spain\) Solar Energetic Particles \(SEPs\) prediction system, automating SEPs prediction for different forecast windows \[4\]. 

 **Developing the Imaging Module** 

 We developed novel imaging techniques for the automatic pre\-processing, detection and feature extraction of solar features \(e.g. active regions, sunspots, filaments\) captured by the Michelson Doppler Imager \(MDI\) instrument on\-board NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory \(SOHO\) satellite. In 2008, we introduced the first automated and real\-time system to classify sunspots based on the McIntosh classification system \[3\], which became the cornerstone for ASAP \[2\]. Before that, the classification of sunspots was a manual time\-consuming process that was carried out by experts. 

  

 **Developing the AI Module** 

 The AI module extracts knowledge from various solar catalogues/images and represents this knowledge in computerised learning rules. ASAP’s predictions are generated by comparing the feature patterns detected by the imaging module with the knowledge extracted by the AI module. We started by developing new data mining technology to investigate the correlation between solar events and solar features. This technology \[1,3,5\] was used to extract knowledge from the following catalogues: SMART Magnetic Features Catalogue produced by Trinity College Dublin, National Geophysical Data Centre \(NGDC\) Solar Flares Catalogue, NGDC filament catalogue, SOHO/LASCO CME catalogue, and NGDC sunspots Catalogue.  We modified our machine learning technology to investigate the feasibility of CMEs prediction by associating CMEs events with flares \[6\] and filaments \[1\]. 

  

 **Integrating the Imaging and AI Modules to Create ASAP** 

 The performance of the integrated system \(published in 2009\) was tested based on the EU COST action ES0803 space weather metrics. NASA organised two specialised workshops \(USA 2009 and Japan 2018\) for comparing leading global flares prediction models, which resulted in key joint publications, such as \[7\]. ASAP performed well in both workshops and is recognised as a major player in this global effort and an international benchmark. 

 This research was conducted under the supervision of Prof. Rami Qahwaji \(2005 to present\), with significant input from two PDRAs, Dr. Tufan Colak \(2006 \- 2014\) and Dr Omar Ashamari \(2010\- 2016\) alongside four research students.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **ASAP’s Impact on Major Space Agencies** 

 For key decision\-makers, the primary source of information on potential space weather threats is NASA’s Community Coordinated Modelling Center \(CCMC\). ASAP has been integrated with CCMC since 2010, where it is currently operational 24/7 in an automated real\-time manner \[A\-C\]. ASAP, as part of CCMC, is regularly used to provide space weather analysis by NASA’s robotic mission operators \[A\]. 

 ASAP predictions \(current and historical\) are available publicly on NASA’s CCMC portal to a variety of space weather agencies, industries, and users. This enables world\-wide community involvement in real\-time predictions, fosters community validation projects and helps researchers improve their forecasts \[A\]. CCMC users include power companies, satellite operators, aviation companies, insurance companies, and meteorological institutes. ASAP is used by space weather forecasters at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center \(GSFC\) Space Weather Research Centre \(SWRC\). ASAP is used routinely in forecast displays designed by the SWRC staff. SWRC acknowledges that ASAP “ *has proved to provide additional information that allows forecasters to build a more complete picture of space weather conditions throughout the solar system”*.  ASAP’s real\-time predictions provide NASA’s operators with improved predictions of future disturbances in space, which could affect robotic missions in terms of communications, planned activities and orbit. NASA has also integrated ASAP into their Space Weather Explorer \(SWX\) app \[D\], which is available for Android and iOS devices. The android app has been downloaded more than 10,000 times, according to Google Play \[D\]. Citizen scientists can easily access, download and make videos from CCMC models including ASAP’s data in order to engage many different groups of people to improve educational experiences and expand the public understanding of space weather, for example, in 2018, a  [<ins>YouTube video discussing ASAP was made \(in Portuguese\)</ins>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBQ32_4_ZA)<ins>,</ins> which has been viewed almost 50,000 times. 

 ASAP is currently used to inform the operation of the Chandra x\-ray observatory, NASA’s  [Flagship\-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_program)  [space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_telescope), of solar radiation that could affect Chandra’s orbit. As stated by NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center \[E\] *“ASAP is one of several space\-weather indicators used to inform Chandra operations of the recent, current, and projected radiation environment in Chandra’s highly elliptical orbit. Chandra’s radiation\-management strategy uses these indicators combined with protective actions \(stowing the CCDs in high\-radiation environments\) to limit further degradation of the front\-illuminated devices to acceptable levels.”*. An active link to ASAP’s predictions is permanently displayed on  [Chandra’s web page](http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/mta/ASPECT/arc/). 

 The on\-board electronics of launch vehicles, satellites, and other space systems are susceptible to radiation\-induced effects caused by solar storms. High energy particle radiation, caused by solar flares, is the main concern for mission launchers. ASAP was used as a pre\-launch model for ESA during the SEPFlares ESA\-funded project \(ESA ITT Ref: AO/1\-7430/13/NL/AK\) \[F\], where it was used to automate the Solar Energetic Particles prediction model, developed by the Universidad de Málaga \(Spain\). This project delivered new ESA capability to predict solar flares and SEP events and generate warning alerts on safe/unsafe conditions for launch operators. 

 **ASAP’s Prediction of Real\-life Events** 

 Significant solar flares are not very frequent, but they could have serious consequences for different industries. As an example, large flares occurred on 11 March 2015 \(X2.2 flare\), 6 Sep 2017 \(X9.3 flare\) and again on 6 Sep 2017 \(X2.2. flare\). According to SWPC, they disturbed radio communications causing a temporary blackout of high\-frequency radio transmissions on the daylight side of Earth. Low frequency communication, used in navigation, was degraded for an hour. ASAP managed to predict these events successfully at least 6 hours before they actually occurred, as shown below.

 **Improving the Input to Climate Change Models** 

 ASAP’s imaging/AI technology played key role in the EU FP7 project “SOLID: First European Comprehensive SOLar Irradiance Data exploitation”, enabling the release of SLID’s major delivery, which is the  [Observational Solar spectral irradiance \(SSI\) composit](ftp://ftp.pmodwrc.ch/pub/projects/SOLID/database/composite_published)e \[G\]. Variations in SSI are an important driver of the temperature, chemistry and dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere and ultimately the Earth's climate. The SOLID project observational composite is used as an independent validation of the SSI dataset recommended for the next generation CMIP6 \(Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects\) climate model intercomparison \[G\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 **Baulcombe** and colleagues' ground\-breaking discovery of small interfering RNA \(siRNA\) has proved transformative in drug design by permitting the development of drugs that treat previously ""undruggable"" diseases in humans. Specifically, this work has led to the development of four therapeutic drugs based on RNAi \(RNA interference\), ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup>, GIVLAARI<sup>®</sup>, OXLUMO<sup>TM</sup> and LEQVIO<sup>®</sup>. These have been designed to treat serious genetic disorders affecting many thousands of patients worldwide. The drugs realise the ability of RNAi to target disease\-causing genes and represent the first RNAi\-based therapeutics developed anywhere in the world. Over 1,300 patients have received ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup> and GIVLAARI<sup>®</sup>, with life\-changing benefits. Many more will benefit from the recent approval of LEQVIO in the UK/EU. A patent issued to **Baulcombe** and colleagues for RNAi technology has generated GBP10,000,000 in licensing income, while the current impact of the global RNAi therapeutics sector is reflected in its growth in value to approximately USD1,090,000,000 \(12\-2018\).

 2. Underpinning research 

 
In 1990, plant molecular geneticists observed a strange phenomenon: when they inserted a gene controlling flower colour into the Petunia genome, it resulted in white flowers instead of the expected coloured ones. Work over the following years established that the inserted DNA caused gene ""silencing"", so launching the field of RNA interference \(RNAi\). RNAi is a cellular mechanism by which small RNA molecules can prevent the expression of individual genes by interfering with those genes' messenger RNA, i.e. silencing them. Various aspects of the molecular mechanisms underlying RNAi were discovered by different groups, with **Baulcombe**'s laboratory making a number of seminal contributions. 

 For example, **Baulcombe**, Hamilton and colleagues demonstrated that gene silencing effects could spread within individual plants, between different cells and parts of the plant, and discovered the role of small antisense RNAs \(25 nucleotides in size\) in mediating RNAi in plants. Since 2000, they have also identified the key genes involved in the production of small antisense RNAs, specifically RNA\-dependent RNA polymerase \[R1\], RNA helicase \[R2\], RNA polymerase IV \[R3\] and genes that bind small RNAs and slice target RNAs to mediate RNAi \(ARGONAUTE \[R4\]\). Moreover, they have characterised the role of the RNA polymerase PolIVb in siRNA biogenesis and RNA\-directed DNA methylation \[R5\]. This body of research, supported by Grants A\-D, underpinned the fundamental understanding of RNAi, a process that is shared across eukaryotic organisms \(animals, plants, fungi and protists\). 

 In REF2014, the unit submitted an impact case study based on **Baulcombe**'s RNAi research that focused on the impact it had through enabling commercial design, production and sale of synthetic siRNAs as reagents by biotechnology companies \( *""Small interfering RNA – a change in the landscape of biotechnology""*\). In the current case study, we are excited to be able to focus on a new set of significant, far\-reaching impacts that the research has had since REF2014. Specifically, because RNAi can be used to silence individual genes in a targeted manner, **Baulcombe** and colleagues' pioneering discoveries have helped open up a completely new domain of innovation in drug development, namely a novel method for targeting genetic diseases in humans. 

 Many serious human diseases are genetic ones, being caused by abnormalities in the genome such as an altered chromosome number or gene mutations. So\-called autosomal dominant diseases can be inherited from either parent acting as a carrier of the mutated gene and thereby contributing to the transmission and expression of the disorder in their children. The mutated genes result in the production of abnormal proteins that impair or alter their usual function within the cell in a harmful manner. Many such proteins were considered ""undruggable"", i.e. harmful proteins that cannot be targeted pharmacologically by classic methods such as the use of antibodies. RNAi has provided a means of treating such human diseases, previously considered intractable. Indeed, until now only the symptoms, not the causes, could be treated. In this way, RNAi has created an entirely new approach to improving the health and wellbeing of people. 

 Recognising the broader potential impact of their work, **Baulcombe** and colleagues filed for intellectual property on their discoveries on RNAi with Plant Biosciences Limited, an independent technology management company based on the Norwich Research Park, and this patent \[R6\] was then licensed to the US biopharmaceutical company Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. to develop RNAi\-based therapeutics.

 4. Details of the impact 

 **Baulcombe**’s research and its associated intellectual property have proved fundamental to the development of RNAi\-based therapeutics that target previously intractable diseases \[S1\-S3\]. Acting on behalf of **Baulcombe** and colleagues, Plant Bioscience Limited licensed **Baulcombe**'s patent to Alnylam Pharmaceuticals \[R6\], and this has ensured Alnylam's freedom to operate, since 2013, to develop, trial and release three RNAi\-based drugs that target human genetic disorders, along with a fourth to treat inherited high cholesterol \(familial hypercholesterolemia\) \[S4\]. In particular, to target genetic disorders, Alnylam has registered and commercialised the two drugs ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup> and GIVLAARI<sup>®</sup>, and it has obtained permission for early release of a third drug, OXLUMO<sup>TM</sup>, through the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency's Early Access to Medicines Scheme \[S5\] and the United States Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) \[S6\]. It has also received approval of the familial hypercholesterolemia treatment drug LEQVIO<sup>®</sup> from the European Commission \[S4\]. 

 As detailed below, these drugs are providing treatments that patients have described as transformative in their impact on individual lives \[S4, S7\-S9\]. They have also helped underpin the growth of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals as a company and yielded important patent revenues. In this way, the research has had substantial impact on the health and wellbeing of people and on commerce and production in the health sector. As the Managing Director of Plant Bioscience Limited has stated, *""the* *impact of the discovery of siRNAs and understanding of their role in RNAi interference contributed by Sir David Baulcombe and Dr Andrew Hamilton has opened up a new generation of therapeutics. After pioneering development by PBL’s licensing partners these are now having a huge impact across the world, in a wave of new and diverse treatments for previously intractable indications, treating millions of patients with a series of important life\-threatening conditions.""* \[S3\]. 

 <ins> *ONPATTRO</ins><ins>®*</ins> <ins>\(</ins><ins>patisiran</ins><ins>\)</ins><ins>:</ins> The disease hereditary transthyretin\-mediated amyloidosis \(hATTR amyloidosis\) is a life\-threatening, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease driven by the deposition of misfolded transthyretin protein \(TTR protein\) in the heart, nerves and gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 50,000 people, aged mainly between 20 and 40, suffer from the disease worldwide \[S4\]. Without treatment, sufferers typically die between 5 and 15 years after the onset of symptoms. Treatment options are limited, and many cases remain undiagnosed. RNAi therapeutics allow transcripts \(messenger RNA\) from the faulty gene to be silenced, thereby decreasing the amount of misfolded TTR protein in the body. ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup> has been approved by the European Union and United States, along with Brazil, Canada, Israel, Japan, Switzerland and Taiwan, for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis \[S4\]. Based on a large\-scale randomised clinical trial, ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup> significantly reduced patients' symptoms and improved their quality of life, such as walking ability, nutritional status and the ability to perform activities of daily living \[S7, S8\]. As a result, as at the third quarter of 2020, over 1,150 patients were taking ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup> \[S4\]. In terms of improvement in quality of life, a patient treated with ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup> stated, *""I'm so much more than this disease, and I can put it in its place and do the things that I love to do with the people who I most love and adore in my life.""* \[S4\]. 

 <ins> *GIVLAARI</ins><ins>®*</ins> <ins>\(</ins><ins>givosiran</ins><ins>\)</ins>: Acute hepatic porphyria \(AHP\) consists of a group of four inherited diseases of the liver with acute neurovisceral symptoms that are often missed or delayed in diagnosis because the clinical symptoms mimic those of other common disorders. Acute intermittent porphyria is the most severe of the set, with 20% of patients with recurrent symptoms developing chronic and ongoing pain. It occurs in about 1 in 1,600 people with a Western European genetic background and, in the EU and US, the patient population is estimated at 3,000 people \[S4\]. Previously, long\-term solutions for treatment involved either infusion with blood products \(e.g. IV hemin\) or liver transplantation. GIVLAARI<sup>®</sup> was developed to treat adults with acute hepatic porphyria and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in November 2019 \[S4\]. It has also been approved for use in the European Union, Brazil and Canada \[S4\]. This drug significantly reduces the rate of porphyria attacks that require hospitalisations, urgent healthcare visits or infusion with blood products at home. A patient receiving the drug for acute intermittent porphyria stated, *“I've had pain for 10 years, I didn't expect that could go away. I'm seeing friends and they're \[asking\] 'you're not taking any painkillers?' and I was \[saying\] 'no\!'.”* \[S9\]. As at the third quarter of 2020, over 150 patients were being treated with GIVLAARI<sup>®</sup> \[S4\]. 

 <ins> *OXLUMO</ins><ins>TM*</ins> <ins>\(</ins><ins>l</ins><ins>umasiran</ins><ins>\)</ins>: This drug is an RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 \(PH1\). In the EU and US, the patient population is estimated at 3,000 symptomatic individuals \[S4\]. The disease is caused by the build\-up of oxalate, which is normally excreted in the urine. In affected people, the accumulated oxalate is deposited in the kidneys and urinary tract, where it combines with calcium to form the main component of kidney and bladder stones \(calcium oxalate\). Lumasiran is currently under approval and has been granted a ""positive scientific opinion"" \(i.e. approved for use by the National Health Service\) through the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency's Early Access to Medicines Scheme \[S5\]. 

 <ins> *LEQVIO</ins><ins>®*</ins> <ins>\(</ins><ins>inclisiran</ins><ins>\)</ins>: LEQVIO<sup>®</sup> is the first siRNA drug that reduces low\-density lipoprotein cholesterol \(LDL\-C\) in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Approximately 3,900,000 people die annually in Europe from cardiovascular disease, of which high cholesterol \(hypercholesterolemia\) is a leading cause. While reducing low\-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels using statins is a common treatment for high\-risk patents, the majority of these patients \(80%\) do not experience reductions to below recommended levels. LEQVIO<sup>®</sup> conferred effective and sustained low\-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction of up to 52% in patients. It was approved by the European Commission in December 2020 \[S4\]. It is estimated that approximately 50,000,000 people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or familial hypercholesterolemia could benefit from treatment with LEQVIO<sup> *®*</sup> in future \[S4\]. For example, in the UK, the Managing Director of Plant Bioscience Limited reported that: *“NHS projections estimate the drug will save 30,000 lives for every 300,000 patients treated”* \[S3\]. 

 Overall, the scope of using RNAi for drug development is limited only by the identification of sequence targets relevant to a given disease. As such sequences are identified, drugs based on RNAi are being developed to target genes for an increasing range of diseases, including cancer \(e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF\), and to target viruses underpinning viral diseases, including Hepatitis B and the recent pandemic disease COVID\-19. Similarly, drugs targeting specific genes are being developed to treat diseases such as haemophilia, Alpha\-1 liver disease, hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy \[S2, S4\]. Hence, RNAi\-based drug development has an extremely promising future. 

 <ins> *Economic impact of RNAi\-based therapeutics</ins><ins>.*</ins> As a young and rapidly growing development, the market in RNAi\-based therapeutics has yet to realise its full economic potential. Nonetheless, in 2018, the global size of this market was already estimated to be approximately USD1,090,000,000 \(12\-2018\) \[S10\]. RNAi drugs have also contributed substantially to the income and financial growth of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Specifically, for ONPATTRO<sup>®</sup>, the company's quarterly revenues increased from USD46,100,000 \(12\-2020\) in the third quarter of 2019 to USD82,500,000 \(12\-2020\) in the third quarter of 2020 \[S4\]. In addition, in the third quarter of 2020, GIVLAARI<sup>®</sup> earned the company USD16,700,000 \(12\-2020\) \[S4\]. For **Baulcombe** and colleagues, the patent \[R6\] issued for RNAi technology and managed by Plant Bioscience Limited has generated GBP10,000,000 in licensing income since 01\-2014 \[S3\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prof Stephenson’s research on gangs in Russian society posed a fundamental challenge to stereotypes of gangs as purely criminal business organisations or substitutes for state power. Instead she has shown that gangs need to be analysed as context specific organisations that develop cultural forms of solidarity, territoriality and gender. Stephenson’s research has influenced the leading Russian NGO, Public Centre for Judicial and Legal Reform, in developing their interregional programme of gang prevention and rehabilitation strategies, which have been rolled out to all 27 territorial justice centres across Russia. Her work has informed public understandings in the West, and challenged conventional wisdoms about criminal organisations, state and society in Russia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Stephenson’s research addressed the rise of criminal gangs in the context of Russia’s transition to capitalism, and their transformation into organised crime groups with tight links to the state. Her research, culminating in a major 2015 book \[R1\] was qualitative in nature, and involved interviews with gang members aged 18\-32, community members, business leaders and representatives of law enforcement in Kazan and Moscow. The research took place over 2005\-2019 and included collaboration with Russian researchers, Aleksander Salagaev, Aleksander Shashkin and Rustem Safin \(Kazan State Technological University\), who were involved in the project design and facilitated access to the research participants. 

 The 2015 book was the first to explore Russian gangs and their transformation as conditioned by the economic, political and cultural changes in Russian society pre\- and post\- market transition. Stephenson showed that many street gangs have developed from neighbourhood alliances offering protection services into serious organised crime groups. While revealing the complex organisation of much of the gangs’ criminal business, Stephenson argued that the gangs, rather than being vehicles for economic operations or substitutes for the absent state authority, develop cultural forms of solidarity, territoriality, gender and leadership. Stephenson’s approach highlights the necessity to approach gangs in culturally sensitive ways, overcoming the US\-centric focus of gang criminology that creates multiple problems for understanding gangs in the non\-Western and global sphere. 

 Stephenson’ research challenges the established view that the gang is a collection of socially excluded and damaged individuals left to survive in the shadow of modern institutions through crime and violence. She demonstrates that a substantial portion of young gang members aspire to mainstream success via the vehicles of employment and education. She argues that by developing these opportunities it is possible to effectively limit the attractions of gang membership. 

 Stephenson’s analysis also shows that, while the gangs’ economic power has weakened in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century as the Russian state strengthened, their social and cultural influence has remained substantial. The book and a 2015 paper in Russian \[R2\] drew parallels between the street gang logic and the behaviour and culture of the Russian economic, cultural and political elites, including President Vladimir Putin’s public use of gang language. The study of deep social and cultural integration of the gang into the Russian society allows for novel considerations about the permeable nature of the borders between formal and informal economies and societal formations in Russia and represents important evidence for business communities, working in the Russian markets, and civil servants, both in the West and in Russia. 

 In her 2016 \[R3 and R4\], 2017 \[R3\] and 2019 \[R5\] papers Stephenson further investigated the gangs’ entrepreneurial ethos and their multiple alliances with the representatives of the state. Contrary to the established views, Stephenson argued that instead of a state monopoly on violence or the subjugation of organised crime by a political elite, in Russia there exists reciprocal assimilation between state and private violent agents. She described the intertwined networks of legality and illegality that work in concert in officially sanctioned and non\-sanctioned ways, reproducing social order. Her approach further highlights the fact that the Russian experience does not fit the global corruption and organised crime paradigms.

 **Influencing gang prevention and rehabilitation strategies** 

 Stephenson’s research has influenced the policies and practice of civil society groups and state organisations in Russia, working to prevent young people’s gang affiliation, rehabilitate offenders and support victims. Stephenson’s research on the causes of youth dislocation has informed several projects conducted by the Interregional NGO “Public Centre for Judicial and Legal Reform” \(PCJLR, Moscow\). This leading Russian civil society organisation has been working in partnership with The State Prosecution Service and the Russian Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice on protecting the rights of the child, preventing juvenile offending and developing restorative justice across Russia. 

 Stephenson has been a consultant to the project, “Territoria” \(2017\-2023\) supported by a Russian President’s grant. The project aims to promote the reduction in violence, intergenerational conflict, and strengthening of positive ties between young people. The project began with a pilot in Kazan, where it involved a collaboration between the PCJLR and the Kazan City Committee on Children and Youth. Stephenson assisted the PCJLR in preparing the grant application and developing the aims, objectives and key activities of the programme. In February 2017 she participated in the training event for schoolteachers, school psychologists and youth workers, discussing the main conclusions of her research and how these can be used in working with gang\-affected young people. The aims of the interventions that the project has developed were based on building young people’s positive links to the community as opposed to the previous predominantly punitive approach to group delinquency. 

 As the toolkit on “Building resilience towards criminal gangs among teenagers” published by the Kazan City Committee on Children and Youth, explains, Stephenson’s research helped the staff of the City Committee in their work. \(S7\) In an email to Stephenson, the head of Kazan city youth psychological services, says, “Thank you for your work that helped us in our project to build resilience towards organised criminal groups among teenagers”. \(S1\).Referring to Stephenson’s support to the Kazan pilot project, the President of the PCJLR says “We introduced school workshops for teenagers in Kazan, where young people learn how to avoid street victimisation. All of this activity drew directly on evidence from Stephenson’s research. The workshops in Kazan involved 427 teenagers. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from schoolteachers”. \(S2\) 

 In 2019, on the basis of the Kazan pilot, the PCJLR set up further gang\-resilience programmes in all of the 27 territorial restorative justice centres across Russia, working with the Russian General Prosecution Service, the courts, youth services and schools. In addition to school workshops with teenagers at risk of victimisation, the programme involved the development of mediation between members of different territorial gangs and street\-based groups, and mediation between offenders and victims. The PCJLR were involved in the training of 5095 mediators \(of whom two thirds were young people\). By the end of March 2020 676 restorative justice programmes were conducted with underage offenders, 652 programmes took place with the victims and 758 programmes involved family members. Altogether 7128 members of the public took part in the programmes. The evaluation of the programme showed that 68% of juvenile offenders who participated in the restorative justice programmes \(victim\-offender mediation and community restitution\) agreed that the outcomes of these programmes were fair; and 75% of the victims also agreed with this \(S2\). The PCJLR distributed copies of the Russian translation of Stephenson’s book “Gangs of Russia” to all territorial restorative justice centres.  In August 2020 Stephenson participated in an online workshop with the leaders of regional programmes, which discussed the further development of the project up to 2023. \(S3\) 

 In a testimonial, the President of the PCJLR says, “Stephenson’s research helps us understand the real motives of the teenagers, their values, clarify the social factors that lead to their marginalisation. We are grateful to Svetlana Stephenson for her detailed study of juvenile crime and the social factors of juvenile criminalisation. Her work helped us to develop family conferences with gang members, and mediation programmes for victims and perpetrators of street violence.” \(S2\) 

 Stephenson’s research also informed the policy of the Russian government on social reintegration of the members of delinquent gangs. Dr Elena Danilova, the Institute of Sociology, Moscow, describes how she used Stephenson’s research in her 2018 report to the Expert Committee of the Russian Ministry of Labour, working on developing the programme of activities within the Russian\-wide “Decade of Childhood” \(2018\-2027\). The programme aims to strengthen the state policies of protection of childhood.  The report “informed the Committee members about the results” of Stephenson’s studies showing that “a proportion of teenagers experience a ‘drift’ from the values of family and school to alternative \[criminal\] values, and that the strengthening of social relations in school and family can prevent such drift. These conclusions were positively received, and as a result of our deliberations we managed to include the development of restorative justice, including mediation and family conferences with …members of delinquent groups and gangs into the government programme.”\[S6\] 

 **Informing the debate in Russia** 

 **Stephenson’s work has informed the debate on gangs in Russia, through invited public talks and media interviews.**  In her lectures and interviews she highlighted the need to develop a more sensitive understanding of gang membership in the Russian context and understand their motives within the context of their marginalisation and the presence of mainstream aspirations among many gang members. 

 Her work has also contributed to a better understanding of the ways in which the criminal culture that flourished in Russia in the 1990s has influenced the wider political culture. In her article in a popular Russian online media resource “Snob” in 2016, the political analyst Maria Snegovaya noted how Stephenson’s identification of key cultural orientations and the worldview of the gangsters have now been replicated within the political establishment, saying that Stephenson “formulated the principles of behaviour of real bandit gangs that perfectly describe the Kremlin policy” \(S8\). Snegovaya’s article was read 15,706 times. The Russian book was also reviewed in a range of widely read publications, including the leading magazine “Neprikosnovennyi zapas” and the popular online media resource “Takie dela”. 

 Stephenson’s research also influenced an art project by the Russian contemporary artist Anton Zimerman in his work on the research exhibition *Moscow – Kazan – Moscow* \(Kazan, 2018, Centre for Research Art\). The exhibition presented contemporary art projects on the history and current development of Kazan.  In his  letter, in which he requested documents about the Kazan gangs for his forthcoming exhibition, Zimerman said ‘Your book “Gangs of Russia”, published in Russian, helped me to form a clear view of the subject of my artistic project’ \(S4\). 

 **Transforming Western understanding of Russian gangs and organised crime** 

 Stephenson’s research has informed a change in Western perceptions of Russian gangs and organised crime, which had previously adhered to Americanised tropes of gang violence. As Tom Porter, International Business Times, discusses Stephenson “penetrated the wall of silence surrounding Russia's gang culture… for a landmark study on the past, present, and future of the Russian mafia,” noting that while some gang members have “graduated to become mafia bosses, responsible for lucrative drugs and weapons trafficking networks,” others were in key positions in business, “security services or in central or regional government.” \[S9\] Stephenson’s research has repositioned the perception of Russian gang membership as purely criminal, with members now utilising the connections and support of a gang to join or progress more established career paths. As an audience member at Glasgow’s “Aye Write\!” literary festival \(2016\) also noted, “it is not poverty or lack of opportunity that drives membership,” but a wider set of criteria including a route to status within the community. \[S5\] The discussion with Laurie Taylor on BBC Radio 4’s *Thinking Allowed,* acknowledged that gangs across the globe had evolved beyond the historical local nexus into social movements, peacekeeping and become institutionalised within corrupt practices of governments and police. \[S10\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Sheffield team pioneered autologous haematopoietic stem cell treatment \(AHSCT\) as a novel treatment in relapsing\-remitting multiple sclerosis \(RRMS\) and headed the UK arm of the first international phase II randomized controlled trial that compared AHSCT with other disease\-modifying treatments \(DMTs\). This trial showed that AHSCT halted disease progression and improved disability outcomes. AHSCT has since been incorporated into national and international guidelines and clinical practice as the “standard of care” with direct benefits to patient quality of life and ever\-increasing cost savings. The ongoing impact has been nationally recognized in the 2019 National Future NHS Parliamentary and the 2020 Queen Anniversary Awards, and internationally by the 2020 Clinical Research Forum \(USA\) Top Ten Research Achievement Award.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Multiple sclerosis \(MS\) is a chronic immune\-mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. In 2016, there were 2,221,188 prevalent cases of multiple sclerosis globally. In the UK, there are currently \~130,000 MS patients, and 6,700 people are diagnosed with MS each year. The US currently has \~1 million MS cases. RRMS is the most common form of MS, affecting about 85% of people diagnosed with MS. A challenge in the treatment of MS has been that DMTs reduced relapse rate and slowed the accumulation of disability to varying degrees, but they did not halt its progression. 

 To address the limitations of the available DMTs, research by Professors Snowden and Sharrack investigated the treatment of RRMS with AHSCT, is a novel therapeutic strategy based on purging autoreactive lymphocytes with the use of chemotherapy\-based ‘conditioning regimens’ and restarting the immune system using the patient’s own haematopoietic stem cells in a new non\-inflammatory environment. Snowden has pioneered the use of AHSCT in various autoimmune disorders \(ADs\). In 2011, Snowden performed the first national analysis of long\-term outcomes of HSCT in ADs based on the British Society of Blood and Marrow \(BSDM\) Transplantation Data Registry. This study concluded that the treatment of poor\-risk but reversible ADs in patients with adequate fitness for HSCT is warranted \[R1\]. Sharrack has been at the forefront of the development of AHSCT as a novel disease\-modifying therapy for RRMS. In 2015, with co\-researchers from Northwest University, he published the results of an uncontrolled trial showing that among patients with RRMS, AHSCT was associated with significant improvement in neurological disability \[R2\]. 

 As members of the MS\-AHSCT Long\-Term Outcomes Study Group, Snowden and Sharrack contributed to an observational study of long\-term disability outcomes of patients with RRMS. The results showed that nearly half of these patients were free of neurological progression 5 years after receiving AHSCT \[R3\]. 

 Following these uncontrolled trials, Sharrack and Snowden led the UK arm of the first international phase II randomized controlled trial \(conducted in four sites—Chicago \(US\), Sheffield \(UK\), Uppsala \(Sweden\) and Sao Paulo \(Brazil\)\) that compared AHSCT with other DMTs \(MIST Study; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00273364\). The trial showed that in patients with RRMS, compared with standard DMTs, AHSCT halted disease progression in the majority of patients who received it. Notably, there was significant improvement in the level of disability in patients treated with AHSCT. In particular, there was no evidence of disease activity \(i.e., no evidence of relapses, disability progression or MRI disease activity\) in 68%–70% of the AHSCT patients at 5 years following the transplant \(see figure\). In contrast, less than 8% of patients treated with various DMTs achieved ‘no evidence of disease activity’ status. Furthermore, the majority of patients in whom standard DMTs failed during the course of trial significantly improved when they crossed over to receive AHSCT, challenging the traditional dogma that disability progression in MS is irreversible \[R4\]. Overall, the MIST trial showed that AHSCT is the most effective treatment in patients with active RRMS \[R4, Figure 1\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Based on the research of Professors Snowden and Sharrack, AHSCT is now the “standard of care” in clinical practice as recommended through public policy changes with direct benefits to patients worldwide and reduced costs to the NHS. 

 Impact on national and international public policy 

 The Sheffield research \[R1\-4\] has provided an evidence base for national and international professional society guidelines, position statements and recommendations on the use of AHSCT for MS and other ADs, which has extended the reach of the impact to the global level. As a core member of the Joint Accreditation Committee\-ISCT & European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplant \(EBMT\), Snowden contributed to the EBMT consensus guidelines for immune monitoring and biobanking \[S1\] and produced general guidance for patients, families and carers considering hematopoietic stem cell transplantation \[S3\]. As a member of the Transplant Center and Recipient Issues Standing Committee for the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Snowden also participated in developing their 2019 recommendations for establishing a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation program \[S2\]. In 2019, Sharrack coordinated the EBMT consensus guidelines on the use of HSCT in neurological immune\-mediated disorders \[S4\]. 

 Based on the results of the MIST trial, AHSCT has been approved as a treatment for RRMS in Wales, Scotland and is now provided through the NHS England commissioning route \[S5\]. The Belgian consensus protocol for autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in MS was also informed by the Sheffield research \[R4\] and the EBMT guidelines \[S6\]. The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation quoted the MIST study when revising the recommended indication for AHSCT in MS from ‘developmental’ to ‘standard of care, clinical evidence available’ for patients with relapsing forms of MS \(RRMS or progressive MS with superimposed activity\) \[S6\]. 

 Impact on clinical practice 

 As a result of the changes in guidelines underpinned by the Sheffield research, the use of AHSCT in the treatment of ADs has increased by approximately one\-third since 2016. The majority of this increase relates to the treatment of RRMS \[S4\]. 

 Impact on patient quality of life and public understanding 

 Direct and long\-lasting impact has been achieved for the patients who participated in the MIST trial \[R4\]. As noted in Section 2, 68–70% of the AHSCT\-treated patients showed no evidence of disease activity, and progression\-free survival was achieved in 70%–91% of these patients. 

 The improvement in patient quality of life after AHSCT is described by the recipients interviewed by the media. In a BBC Panorama documentary \(2.5 million viewers\) and major newspapers \[S7\], one patient who was wheelchair bound after the birth of her daughter reported that this new treatment has transformed her life. “ *It worked wonders*,” she said. “ *I remember being in the hospital... after three weeks, I called my mum and said: 'I can stand'. We were all crying. I can run a little bit, I can dance. I love dancing, it is silly but I do. I enjoy walking my daughter around the park in her pram. It is a miracle but I can do it all*."" Another patient, who had active MS, remained relapse free for three years after having AHSCT. He said, “ *Several of my symptoms have now disappeared – I no longer get spasms that go down my spine when I flex my head forward, and my right leg hasn't given way for three years*.” 

 The Sheffield team who pioneered this treatment for people living with MS has been recognised by the 2019 National Future NHS Parliamentary Award for their research having a life\-changing impact “ *on a number of patients who previously failed to respond to standard therapies, with some now being able to walk, run and even dance as a result of being involved in the trial*” \[S8\]. With other neuroscience researchers, the team received the national 2020 Queen Anniversary Award for research that has improved patient outcomes for people living with some of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases \[S8\] and an international 2020 Clinical Research Forum \(USA\) Top Ten Research Achievement Award which honours outstanding accomplishments in clinical research \[S8\]. 

 In further recognition of the benefit from AHSCT in RRMS, national and international patient organizations such as the MS Societies in the UK and US/Canada and the NHS directly refer to the MIST study in their patient information pages to help them make treatment decisions \[S9\]. 

 Impact on health economics 

 Approximately 18,800 people in England are eligible for treatment with AHSCT. The recurring annual cost for the previous best available treatments is £15,000\-£35,000 per patient, whereas the one\-time cost for the AHSCT procedure is £30,000 \(these estimates exclude clinical care costs\). In the USA annual costs for DMT per patient are $80,000\-100,000 compared to the one of cost of $85,184 for AHSCT. Therefore, although the initial costs may be similar, the cost savings for Healthcare providers continue to accumulate \[S10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This programme of research, led by Ulster University, impacts on the health care experience for patients, families and nurses \(beneficiaries\) through the implementation of eight key performance indicators \(KPIs\), thereby addressing a deficit in how the quality of nursing care is measured. Implementing the KPIs generates data that nursing teams can use to critically evaluate the patient experience and make improvements to person\-centred practice. The reach has extended across a range of clinical specialities, spanning the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia. 

 Impact can be evidenced in three areas: 

 **I1** enhancement of the health care experience for patients and families; 

 **I2** enhancement of the health care experience for nurses; 

 **I3** influencing strategy and policy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research comprises: \(i\) our original study that led to development of the **key performance indicators** \(KPIs\) for nursing and midwifery and accompanying **measurement tools**; and \(ii\) a series of **implementation research studies** that have evaluated the use of these KPIs in a range of clinical settings across the UK, Europe and Australia. 

 *The original research to develop KPIs* 

 The aim of the original research \(2012\) was to gain consensus from a range of key stakeholders on KPIs that were appropriate and relevant for nursing and midwifery practice. This study adopted a nominal group technique that resulted in identification of eight top\-ranked indicators and measurement tools considered core for nursing and midwifery practice \( **R1**\). The KPIs are presented below. 

 *KPI 1: Consistent delivery of nursing care against identified need* 

 *KPI 2: Patient confidence in the knowledge and skills of the nurse* 

 *KPI 3: Patient sense of safety whilst under the care of the nurse* 

 *KPI 4: Patient involvement in decisions made about his/her nursing care* 

 *KPI 5: Time spent by nurses with the patient* 

 *KPI 6: Respect from the nurse for patient’s preference and choice* 

 *KPI 7: Nurse’s support for patients to care for themselves where appropriate* 

 *KPI 8: Nurse’s understanding of what is important to the patient and their family* 

 *Uniqueness of the KPIs to nursing and midwifery* 

 The eight indicators identified were considered novel in that they: \(i\) did not conform to the majority of other nursing metrics generally reported in the international literature; \(ii\) were strategically aligned to work on improving patient experience; and \(iii\) measured person\-centred practice. Person\-centredness is an approach to practice that is underpinned by the importance of therapeutic relationships among professionals, patients and others significant to them in their lives. At the heart of the KPIs is the unique contribution of nursing and ultimately its impact on patient outcomes. 

 *The measurement tools* 

 The measurement tools accompanying the KPIs comprised: a patient survey; a tool to observe time spent with patients; patient and family stories; and a review of the patient record undertaken in conjunction with nurse interviews. A feasibility study was undertaken to test the eight KPIs and measurement tools as an approach to evidencing the patient experience involving nine practice settings in three participating organisations across the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland \(2015\). The findings revealed that the data generated by the KPIs did accurately evidence the patient experience and that it also provided feedback to nurses and midwives that informed the development of person\-centred practice **\(R2\).** 

 *Implementation research studies* 

 The eight KPIs and measurement tools have been tested in a series of international implementation research studies in a range of clinical settings led by Ulster University. The Paediatric International Nursing Study \(PINS\) involved acute paediatric inpatients from 12 organisations across Europe and Australia \(2015\). The aim was to explore factors that influenced the successful implementation of the eight KPIs, and how the evidence generated impacted on person\-centred practice across a range of services provided to sick children. This study confirmed that using the KPIs generated data that engaged nursing teams in the critical evaluation of the patient experience to make changes in practice, for example, more effective communication with children and their families, thus enhancing care experience **\(R3\)**. The evolution of the research led to a further study to develop and test the feasibility of an app \(iMPAKT\) on a mobile device, in collaboration with School of Computing \(2016\). This technology enabled the gathering of different data sources into one platform, using the measurement tools. The study demonstrated that the prototype iMPAKT app made information more accessible, captured it in real\-time and enabled it to be used more easily to improve the experience of care **\(R4\).** The app was developed further for use with community nursing teams across Scotland and Northern Ireland \(2018\), highlighting its transferability into a community context **\(R5\).** Drawing on outcomes from previous studies, further research was undertaken to explore the impact of implementing the eight KPIs to support the development of person\-centred care across ambulatory chemotherapy units in Northern Ireland \(2019\). The findings demonstrated that a collaborative approach to implementing the KPIs was directly correlated with enhancement of the health care experience for patients and nurses, for example in relation to shared decision making **\(R6\).**

 **4.** **Details of the impact** 

 The purpose of this programme of work was to evaluate the impact of implementing the KPIs on the experience of care for patients, families and staff across different clinical contexts. Impacts **I1** and **I2** are interconnected within the implementation studies and are described simultaneously. 

 *Enhancement of the health care experience for patients and families and for nurses* 

 Through the Paediatric International Nursing Study \(PINS\), the eight KPIs were implemented across a range of sick children’s services \(2013\-2015\) **\(R3\).** It involved 6 organisations in Australia \(Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth; Royal North Shore Hospital, NSW; Hornsby Hospital, NSW; Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District, NSW; Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide; and the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network\) and 6 in Europe \(Hans Christian Andersen Children's Hospital, Odense, Denmark; Temple Street Children's University Hospital, Dublin; Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, England; East Kent, England; Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, Northern Ireland; and South Eastern Trust, Northern Ireland\). Participating sites confirmed the value of the data captured by the KPIs as a means of highlighting “ *the positive and excellent care that is provided and is recognised and appreciated by families*”, whilst at the same time being able to act on “ *immediate negative feedback that identifies people or interdisciplinary services and requires attention i.e. is unsafe or disrespectful*” **\(I1, C1\).** It was this that drove practice change by providing meaningful information, permitting nurses to pinpoint directly what specific areas of practice needed improved **\(I1, C1, C2\).** Improvements focused on areas such as nursing documentation, bedside handovers **\(I1, C3\)** and supporting information for families **\(I1, C2\).** Similarly, there was evidence that using the KPIs embraced the value of nursing, impacting on staff morale and providing opportunities to celebrate good practice **\(I2, C1, C2\).** 

 As a result of PINS **\(R3\)**, there was organisational roll out by the Women’s and Children’s Health Network in South Australia across 4 divisions, covering 8 nursing and midwifery teams **\(I1, C1\)**. The KPI data collected from 2013\-2020 had significant reach involving approximately 1,285 patients and families completing surveys or stories, resulting in approximately 80 action cycles **\(I1, C1\).** Examples include: allocation guidelines of patients to staff to improve consistency in care, and development of patient profiles for complex care so families don’t have to repeat their stories **\(I1, C1\).** Staff engagement in this process “ *raise\[d\] awareness of the impact of care, what person\-centred care looks like and what works and doesn’t work*” **\(I2, C1\).** 

 Development of the iMPAKT App \(Implementing and Measuring Person\-centredness using an APP for Knowledge Transfer\) offered a technological solution for collecting the KPI data and was evaluated as an effective method to measure the patient experience in real time **\(R4\)**. Nurses \(n=22\) participated from a range of clinical contexts \(5 sites in South Eastern Health & Social Care Trust, Northern Ireland and 6 sites in Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District, Australia\). Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District has continued to use the iMPAKT app, engaging a total of 177 nursing and midwifery staff across a range of clinical settings. The number of beneficiaries totalled 677 patients and carers **\(C5\).** The impact on nursing practice included: an improved team focus approach to care delivery; changes to staffing allocations and rostering to enhance consistent care; development of person\-centred nursing documentation; and improvement in visibility of nurses for patients **\(I1, C5\).** The positive impact on staff of using the KPI data to improve practice was also emphasised, with the introduction of regular staff celebrations. One unit also developed an employee of the month programme. Other staff benefits included: provision of clinical supervision and reflection; and increased opportunities to de\-brief following challenging situations **\(I2, C5\).** 

 The KPIs have also been implemented by NHS Lothian, Scotland, as part of an organisational care assurance programme between 2017 and 2019. Across 3 hospital sites, 31 acute wards used the KPIs, with 7,940 patients completing the survey and 253 patients providing stories **\(C6\).** Clinical teams were considered the main beneficiaries, with the reporting of improved staff morale **\(I2, C6\).** Patient story feedback was also key in improving practice, such as changing ways of working and addressing long standing environment issues **\(I1, C6\).** Use of the KPIs within NHS Lothian led to further collaboration with South Eastern Health & Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland to test the implementation of the KPIs within a community nursing context **\(R5\).** 

 The significance of the original research **\(R1, R2\)** resulted in the implementation of the KPIs within chemotherapy units \(n=5\), across the entire region of Northern Ireland from 2018 to 2019 **\(R6\).**  A key impact was nurses’ ability to truly involve patients in decisions about their care and the things that really mattered to them in their daily lives **\(I1, C7\).** This influenced a significant regional change in the electronic documentation system used in chemotherapy environments. There was no area in the documentation where nursing staff could capture what was currently important to the patient and their family, leading to significant inconsistency between what the nurse said was important to the patient and a review of the patient documentation. Consequently, the restrictive dropdown menu to record what was important to the patient was expanded with a free text option to ensure what is important to the patient was accurately captured and evidenced as an ongoing dialogue **\(I1, C8\).** The impact was also significant for chemotherapy nurses and influenced their ability to clearly articulate their role and enhance their contribution to the patient experience **\(I2, C7\).** Nursing teams felt disempowered to reduce waiting times for patients, but the KPI data encouraged them to think differently about this issue and as a result developed person\-centred interventions. It was “ *small simple changes that can play a big part of a patient’s experience and journey*”, with examples including: offering complimentary therapies to reduce stress and anxiety and to facilitate relaxation; working with the catering department to install a fridge in the unit to provide patients with fresh cool bottled water; and developing a post\-discharge pack to provide a range of information to enhance experience of patients after they have finished their chemotherapy treatment. These interventions led to an enhanced patient experience **\(I1, C7\).** 

 *Influencing strategy and policy* 

 Finally, there is evidence of the programme of work influencing strategy and policy. NHS Lothian, Scotland, illustrated this through the impact of the work on the Board’s Patient Experience Strategy **\(I3, C6\).** Similarly, within Illawarra Shoalhaven, Australia, the KPIs aligned with the Nursing and Midwifery Workforce Plan and “ *provided a link between policy and practice*” **\(I3, C5\).** Within Northern Ireland the KPIs are being used to inform policy for nursing through the Northern Ireland Cancer Strategy and the Nursing and Midwifery Task Group **\(I3, C9\).** Further implementation of the KPIs on an international stage is evidenced by the establishment of a Chief Nursing Officers’ Collaborative between Australia and Northern Ireland to further develop the iMPAKT app for large scale use **\(I3, C10\).**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Stirling has improved the health and wellbeing of many thousands of primates and dogs used in laboratory research and testing across the world. This is a result of our evidence\-based Refinements to: 

-  positive reinforcement protocols and validation of welfare assessment indicators **\(Impact 1\)**; 

-  the procedure for oral compound delivery and housing for dogs **\(Impact 2\);** 

-  cage sizes for all primates: 5\-15 fold volume increase for marmosets & tamarins **\(Impact 3\)**. 

 These Refinements have been incorporated into the animal welfare guidelines of the National Centre for the Reduction, Refinement and Replacement of Animals in Research **\(Impact 4\)**, which underpin humane animal research. 

 Poor animal welfare reduces findings’ reliability and validity. 

 We research training, oral gavage, and cage sizes to increase welfare. 

 **1:** Positive reinforcement protocols & validation of welfare indicators. 

 **2:** Refined procedure for oral gavage. 

 **3:** Larger primate cage sizes. 

 **4:** Animal welfare guidelines enhanced. 

 **CONTEXT & RESEARCH** 

 Improved scientific outputs and economic benefits due to more reliable, valid results. 

 **DIRECT WELFARE IMPACTS** 

 **OVERALL IMPACTS** 

**Overall impacts:** this improved welfare for laboratory animals means they are more “fit for purpose” as models of human biological functioning, increasing the reliability and validity of scientific output and therefore also having substantial cost savings during drug development. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Improving the welfare of the 200,000\+ dogs and primates used in laboratory research and testing globally is not only an ethical imperative given their capacity to suffer, but also increases the reliability and validity of the results of the studies conducted upon these animals \(as stress affects biological functioning\). Our research has validated interdisciplinary methods used for welfare assessment, as well as evaluating and providing evidence\-based improvements to housing, husbandry and scientific procedures for primates and dogs in laboratories. This follows the ‘Refinement’ principle of the 3Rs framework for more humane animal research \(see NC3Rs.org\). Stirling research has been at the forefront, as improvements to the world\-leading UK animal welfare standards ratchet those internationally. 

 Bassett et al. \(2003\) \(see output **R1**\) demonstrated that positive reinforcement protocols can be used to train marmosets so they can be weighed in their home cages and provide urine samples on request. This avoids stressful capture and handling, and negates the need for stressful single housing in a metabolism cage. Findings showed trained marmosets had a reduction in the “stress hormone” cortisol, which was validated against behaviours indicative of better welfare compared to controls, meaning trained monkeys had better biological functioning and were more “fit for purpose” as healthy models. We also evidenced an infant rearing practice for large litters of marmosets that does not adversely impact their welfare \( **R2**\). We developed research\-based training protocols for macaques and dogs \( **R3**\) that improve welfare. This research has underpinned **Impacts 1** and **4**, detailed below. 

  

 Oral gavage is a technique frequently used to deliver a compound via a tube directly into the stomach. Gavage is aversive and the frequency of its use is a cause for welfare concern. Using our Welfare Assessment Framework, incorporating behaviour, cardiovascular and affective measures, Hall et al. \(2015\) <sup> </sup>\( **R3**\) showed that sham dosing \(an attempt to habituate dogs to dosing\) is ineffective and ‘primes’ rather than desensitises dogs to dosing. Our refined procedure delivers considerable benefits for welfare and quality of data. Research on pen design <sup> </sup>\( **R4**\) indicates other factors to consider to promote better welfare and better scientific endpoints for dogs. This research has underpinned **Impacts 2** and **4**, detailed below. 

 Adequate space reduces the incidence and frequency of abnormal behaviours \(e.g. locomotor stereotypy\), increases the diversity and complexity of natural behaviours, and is thus essential for good welfare and quality of scientific output. The vast majority of policy guidelines and legislation on research animals specified minimum cage sizes for laboratory\-housed primates solely in terms of “unit body weight”. Prescott and Buchanan\-Smith \( **R5**\) argued that optimum cage size depends on body size, arboreality and cage use, home range size, mean daily path length and stereotypic behaviour, breeding success in captivity, and species predisposition, not body weight alone. We recommended that minimum cages sizes should be increased for all primates: and that greater space is even more important for tamarin welfare than for marmoset. Evidence substantiating the differences between tamarins and marmosets comes from both Buchanan\-Smith’s captive and field studies <sup> </sup>\( **R6**\) which relate natural history to the housing and captive care of tamarins. This research has underpinned **Impact 3** and **4**, detailed below.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Worldwide, more than 200,000 primates and dogs are used in laboratory research \(see  [stir.ac.uk/4bu](https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.20054) &  [stir.ac.uk/4bx](http://hdl.handle.net/1893/21156)\). Improving the welfare of these animals is an ethical imperative, and of public interest. The welfare of primates and dogs can be compromised when they live in restricted laboratory conditions and are exposed to the exacting requirements of research \(e.g. restraint, dosing\), adversely affecting scientific output quality. Industry concerns therefore centre on welfare, public perception, good scientific output, and cost. Our research recommendations have directly caused the Refinement of care and scientific procedures for primates and dogs across the world by large pharmaceutical companies and Contract Research Organisations, contributing to major improvements in the welfare of many thousands of animals. 

##  Impact 1: Positive Reinforcement Protocols & Validation of Welfare Indicators 

 It is now commonplace for facilities to use the guidance on housing, husbandry, and positive reinforcement training of primates developed from our research \( **R1, R2, R5**\). This is demonstrably evident at major research centres such as: the Central Institute for Experimental Animals \(Japan, **SC1c**\), who have also integrated our guidance into their own 2018 *Marmoset Lab Manual*; the University of Cambridge \(>200 marmosets, **SC1f**\); the Primate Research Institute \(Kyoto University, Japan, **SC1g**\); The Wisconsin National Primate Centre, USA, with \~ 1,600 primates \( **SC1h**\) and the Biomedical Primate Research Centre \(BPRC; one of Europe's largest research primate centres with >1,200 primates\) who indicate, “ *Staff working at the BPRC have implemented the research recommendations from Buchanan\-Smith's team on positive reinforcement training for macaques and marmosets, and ways to improve housing, rearing and to refine scientific procedures*” \(Designated Veterinarian, BPRC, **SC1b**\). 

 Our team developed an essential resource for marmoset welfare,  [Marmosetcare.com](http://marmosetcare.com/) \( **SC5a,** see Fig. 1\). This is a good\-practice guide providing videos of our validated welfare measures, and positive reinforcement training protocols. Marmosetcare.com has had >286,000 unique visitors from 200 countries, >50% from USA \(since 1/8/2012\) indicating global reach and uptake of our housing, husbandry, and training protocols \(in UK, Europe, Japan and USA \- **SC1b,c,f,g,h\)**.

*Pathways* *to impact:* In association with the  [Institute of Animal Technology](https://www.iat.org.uk/), Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) courses on “Training Primates Using Positive Reinforcement” \(2005\-2009\) and on “Marmoset Behaviour and Welfare” \(2004\-2009\) were run each year by Buchanan\-Smith in Stirling \(\~25 participants/year\). Such learning opportunities were enhanced with our open\-access website  [Marmosetcare.com](http://marmosetcare.com/), developed by PhD student Watson and Buchanan\-Smith, based on their research \( **R1, R2, R5**\). Our training recommendations \( **R1**\) were cited in the, still current, 2007  [International Primatological Society Guidelines](http://internationalprimatologicalsociety.org/docs/IPS_International_Guidelines_for_the_Acquisition_Care_and_Breeding_of_Nonhuman_Primates_Second_Edition_2007.pdf). 

##  Impact 2: Refined Procedure for Oral Gavage and Housing of the Dog 

 Since April 2015, all UK grant applicants applying to perform oral gavage in dogs have had to use our refined methods <sup> </sup>\( **R3**\) of oral gavage to improve dog welfare, as applications are reviewed by the NC3Rs, or justify why not \(see **Impact 4**\). Since 2014, at Charles River Laboratories, Edinburgh, our research \( **R4**\) and our website  [RefiningDogCare.com](http://www.refiningdogcare.com/about/stirling/) \( **SC5b\)** *“…led us to improve our training methods for research animals to cooperate with scientific procedures, and to refine oral gavage in the dog, concomitantly improving animal welfare. The publication on how dog welfare is influenced by housing is being incorporated into our new dog facility design”* \(Senior Director of Toxicology, **SC1d**\). Similarly, since 2014 GlaxoSmithKline has transformed their dog training methods based on our research, increasing welfare and their research reliability, and has shared this best practice across its laboratories globally \( **SC1a**\). 

 *Pathways to impact:* The open access website RefiningDogCare.com was launched in 2016 by Scullion Hall and Buchanan\-Smith \(since 14/06/2016 it has had >20,000 unique visitors from >100 countries\). Impact workshops with stakeholders were held \(2014, 2015, 2017, including industry and Home Office representation\) and accredited CPD training delivered onsite by Scullion Hall to all UK major dog users \(2015\-18\). 

##  Impact 3: Increased minimum cage sizes for primates 

 Throughout the impact window \(Aug 2013 \- Dec 2020\) across Europe, minimum cage sizes have increased for primates in laboratories because of our research. In particular, marmosets and tamarins are now treated better \( **R5**, **R6**\). These genera have had significant increases in minimum floor area \(from 0.25m<sup>2</sup>\-0.5m<sup>2</sup> for marmosets and from 0.25m<sup>2</sup> <sup> </sup>\-1.5m<sup>2</sup> for tamarins, see Fig. 2\), and the minimum cage height for these genera is now 1.5m \(over twice the previous 0.6m requirement\). 100% of marmosets and tamarins \(>8,000 animals NC3Rs figure, **SC1e**\) in laboratories in the EU now benefit from larger cages and associated better welfare. As BPRC state, “ *these larger cage sizes, allow more natural social groupings, and greater opportunities to enrich the primates and lead directly to improved wellbeing \(less negative behavior, more positive welfare indicators, including improved physical health\)”* \(Designated Veterinarian, **SC1b**\).

 Current minimum cage size for two tamarins \(2.25m<sup>3</sup>\) 

 Figure 1. Illustration of increases in cage size \(to scale\) 

*Pathways to impact*: Our research \( **R5, R6**\) led directly to European  [Directive 2010/63/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:276:0033:0079:en:PDF) \(in effect from 01/01/2013\), which legislates for increased minimum cage sizes for marmosets and tamarins. This has been transposed into law in all EU states and reporting and inspections are required \( [stir.ac.uk/4c9](http://stir.ac.uk/4c9)\). <sup> </sup>E.g. the 2014 UK Code of Practice \( **SC3**\) incorporated these changes and cites our research. The 2003  [non\-human primates](https://www.coe.int/t/e/legal_affairs/legal_co-operation/biological_safety_and_use_of_animals/laboratory_animals/GT%20123(2002)17rev2%20E%20Part%20B%20Primates.pdf) report upon which the EU directive is based states: “ *It is more important to provide tamarins with a good volume of space than it is marmosets, if their wellbeing and breeding success are to be maximised \(Prescott & Buchanan\-Smith, in press* \[ **R5**\] *\)”* \( **SC2**\) *.* The legislation refers only to Prescott and Buchanan\-Smith’s work as the scientific basis for change in enclosure size. The volume increase is 5 fold for two marmosets, and 15 fold for two tamarins \(see Fig. 2\). As the NC3Rs state, our “ *research on cage size had a direct impact on increasing the mandatory minimum space allocations for NHPs in*  [*Annex III to Directive 2010/63/EU*](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:276:0033:0079:EN:PDF) *\(by 30% to 1400% depending on species, age/weight and grouping\), through my* \[Prescott\] *memberships of the Primate Expert Group for Council of Europe Convention ETS 123 and Technical Expert Working Group for the Directive, thus benefiting around 8,000 NHPs per year used in the European Union since 2013. The positive welfare impact of this research by Buchanan\-Smith and colleagues is thus far\-reaching”* \(Director of Policy & Outreach, NC3Rs, **SC1e**\). 

##  Impact 4: Changes to animal welfare guidelines 

 The NC3Rs guidelines and website have incorporated our research recommendations. The NC3Rs is an organisation with teeth – it provides a service to review all UK proposals involving primates and dogs and advises on opportunities to implement the 3Rs, identify and address animal welfare concerns. This improvement in welfare standards has global reach, as, welfare standards must be consistent with principles of UK legislation for international collaborations. “ *The practical welfare implications of Buchanan\-Smith and Scullion Hall’s research on improving laboratory dog welfare are included in the*  [*NC3Rs web page on dog housing and care*](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/3rs-resources/housing-and-husbandry/housing-and-husbandry-dogs) \[ **SC4**\] *. This page has been viewed over 8,100 times by users in 95 countries … Buchanan\-Smith and Ash’s research on positive reinforcement training of non\-human primates* \[ **R1**\] *, and on rearing of large litters of common marmosets without compromising welfare* \[ **R2**\] *, is incorporated into the 2017 version of the*  [*NC3Rs Guidelines ‘Non\-human Primate Accommodation, Care and Use’*](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/non-human-primate-accommodation-care-and-use) *. Implementation of the principles in the Guidelines is a condition of receiving funds from 15 organisations which support non\-human primate \(NHP\) research internationally. Compliance is assessed by NC3Rs staff during peer review and laboratory visits \(over 100 proposals reviewed and 25 awarded since October 2017*\)” \(Director of Policy & Outreach, NC3Rs, **SC1e**\). 

##  Overall Impacts 

 While commercial sensitivities and the nature of the impacts mean that the exact overall **economic benefits** of the Refinements detailed above are impossible to quantify, GlaxoSmithKline – the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world – considers our work with them on improving dog welfare to have brought it “financial benefits” \( **SC1a**\), a view also held by the BPRC \( **SC1b**\). Substantial reductions in testing costs occur because the outcomes of tests are more reliable and valid, and there is a reduction in unwanted variability, reducing numbers required to reach statistical significance. These economic benefits are likely to be high across the average 12.5 years and \~USD12,000,000,000 it takes to bring a new drug to market \( [stir.ac.uk/4cl](http://stir.ac.uk/4cl)\). Costs can therefore be substantially reduced with better animal welfare, and reducing attrition, even modestly, can have huge financial savings and increased business growth \(independently assessed by Graham and Prescott, 2015:  [10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.03.040](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.03.040)\). 

 In commercial pharmaceutical settings \(i.e. outside of academia\) our animal welfare impacts collectively contribute to “better scientific output as animal welfare and quality of scientific output are so closely linked” \(BPRC, **SC1b**\), a view also supported by testimony from GlaxoSmithKline and Charles River Laboratories \(a multinational pharmaceutical company operating in 20 countries and who have contributed to 85% of United States Food and Drug Administration\-approved drugs in use\), who cite increased scientific output reliability \( **SC1d**\) due to our research\-informed Refinements.

 Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Teesside University on the association between physical activity and colorectal cancer and cardiorespiratory fitness and the effectiveness of jet lag treatments has led to changes to evidence\-based public health guidelines for the UK and USA. Our evidence synthesis research on physical activity and cancer risk, and high\-intensity interval training and fitness, critically informed the official Government physical activity guidelines for population health in the USA and UK. Our evidence synthesis and randomised controlled trial research on jet lag led directly to the co\-production of changes to the guidelines for the management of jet lag in international travellers \(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ‘Yellow Book’, Civil Aviation Authority, the National Health Service, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\).

 Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The impacts in this case study are underpinned by our evidence synthesis and randomised controlled trial research, focusing on the association between physical activity and colorectal cancer and cardiorespiratory fitness, and the effectiveness of jet lag treatments. 

 Insufficient physical activity is one of the major behavioural risk factors for chronic disease. Our research examined the associations between different levels and types of physical activity and health outcomes in two areas – colorectal cancer and cardiorespiratory fitness. A systematic review and meta\-analysis of the association between leisure\-time physical activity and colorectal cancer risk was conducted in 2008\-2009 and published in 2009 \[3.1\]. We estimated summary risk ratios for uppermost vs lowermost categories of physical activity. To quantify dose\-response, we applied a novel bootstrap resampling method to explore risk ratios as a function of cumulative percentiles of physical activity distribution, as heterogeneity in methods of measurement of physical activity levels meant that there was no common metric across the studies. For colon cancer, the research found that greater leisure\-time physical activity was associated with a 20% relative risk reduction in men and 14% in women. The dose–response analysis revealed linear reductions in risk of colon cancer with increasing leisure time physical activity in both genders. 

 Increased cardiovascular\-respiratory fitness is strongly associated with reduced all\-cause mortality. Our systematic review and meta\-analysis of the effects of low\-volume high\-intensity interval training \(HIT\) on fitness in adults was conducted in 2013\-2014 and published in 2014 \[3.2\]. The research showed that low\-volume HIT produces substantial improvements \(6\-10%\) in the maximal oxygen uptake of active non\-athletic and sedentary people. Subsequently, the notion that HIT could be a viable physical activity option for public health benefits was advanced at a debate at the International Society for Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity Annual Meeting in 2015: <ins>High\-intensity exercise as a public health strategy?</ins> This debate was reported in a full journal article \[3.5\]. 

 Jet lag is due to the internal body clock\(s\) of an individual being out of phase with the environmental timing of light/dark and meals after a flight that crosses three or more time zones. In 2017, airlines carried 4,100,000,000 passengers worldwide on scheduled services. The precise incidence of jet lag is unknown, but it negatively affects a substantial proportion of travellers, with symptoms including sleep disorders, daytime tiredness, exhaustion, attention, concentration and memory problems, gastrointestinal problems, and anxiety. We conducted a critical review of jet lag research between 2013 and 2014 \[3.3\]. As part of this review, we undertook an insightful cumulative meta\-analysis that showed the reported effectiveness of melatonin for alleviating jet lag symptoms reduced substantially over time, as higher quality and larger studies were published. This is an example of the ‘decline effect’ in science, where initially large beneficial effects in small early studies are later shown to have been exaggerated substantially. We also led the very first randomised controlled trial on the effectiveness of artificial bright light for reducing jet lag symptoms after a transmeridian long\-haul flight \[3.4\]. We showed that the proposed benefits of bright light, suggested by animal studies and laboratory simulations, do not necessarily translate to clinical/ practical usefulness following an actual transmeridian flight. Previously, guidelines for the treatment of jet lag symptoms have not been informed by higher\-grade evidence. The key novel work that we have undertaken since 2012 is the scrutiny of evidence translation from laboratory studies to real\-world jet lag treatment.

 Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The underpinning research has resulted in changes to evidence\-based public health guidelines for physical activity and jet lag for the UK and USA. Our research has critically informed the current Government physical activity guidelines for population health in the UK and USA. These guidelines are the primary, authoritative, evidence\-based resource for health professionals, policy makers, and individuals on the recommended levels of physical activity to promote population health and reduce chronic disease risk. The development of the guidelines follows a similar process in each country. First, a panel of experts is assembled to rigorously review and scrutinise the evidence base on the relationship between physical activity and health. These experts place primary emphasis on high\-quality systematic reviews. Subsequently, recommendations are drafted, reviewed critically, and finalised. Relevant, high\-quality research used to underpin these recommendations is typically cited in the accompanying scientific reports and working group papers. The live debate at the International Society for Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity Annual Meeting in 2015, and associated paper \[3.5\], acted as a catalyst for the subsequent impact. For the Senior Policy Manager at the UK Government Department of Health and Social Care: ‘the live debate and subsequent paper created a substantial buzz on social media among physical activity scientists, policy makers, and public health commissioners, and stimulated thinking about the potential for very vigorous intermittent physical activity to be included for the first time in the UK physical activity recommendations for public health’ \[5.1\]. 

 Our meta\-analysis \[3.1\] has informed the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. It is referred to eight times in the Cancer Prevention chapter of the scientific report underpinning these Guidelines by the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee \(PAGAC\) \[5.2\]. The report states: ‘one meta\-analysis estimated dose\-response by percentile of physical activity, and found a linear reduction in risk across the 20th to 95th percentiles and estimated risk reductions between these two percentiles of 0.13 in men and 0.14 in women. This same meta\-analysis plotted risk for colon cancer by leisure time physical activity in those studies with MET\-hours per week or MET\-minutes per week data, and found dose\-response risk reductions in both men and women’ \[5.2, p. F4\-17\]. Based on our research, the PAGAC concluded that the evidence grade was ‘strong’ for a dose\-response relationship between increasing physical activity levels and decreasing risk of colon cancer in men and women \[5.2. p. F4\-57\]. Consequently, the Committee recommended that all individuals should be encouraged to engage in the recommended levels of physical activity to reduce risk for developing cancer \[5.2, p. F4\-59\]. 

 Additionally, our meta\-analysis \[3.2\] informed the 2019 UK Government physical activity guidelines. It was cited \(reference \#47\) in the Expert Working Group working paper for adults, presenting the evidence underpinning the guidelines \[5.3\]. Specifically, our findings were used to evidence the benefits of high\-intensity interval training \(HIIT\). Regarding HIIT, the Working Group report states: ‘multiple meta\-analyses and systematic reviews have demonstrated that HIIT has clinically meaningful effects on fitness \(14, 46, 47, 57\), adiposity \(14, 33, 48\), body weight \(25\), and insulin resistance \(25\)’ \[5.3, p.10\]. The final recommendation in the adult guidelines relating to high\-intensity interval activity is: ‘each week, adults should accumulate at least 150 minutes \(2 ½ hours\) of moderate intensity activity \(such as brisk walking or cycling\); or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity \(such as running\); or even shorter durations of very vigorous intensity activity \(such as sprinting or stair climbing\); or a combination of moderate, vigorous and very vigorous intensity activity’ \[5.4, p. 10\]. 

 Importantly, the 2019 update is the first time that HIIT has been included in the UK physical activity guidelines as an option from a menu of choices, based on its demonstrated efficacy in our meta\-analysis and other rigorous evidence syntheses. A Senior Policy Manager at the UK Government Department of Health and Social Care stated: “The rigorous research by Professor Batterham and colleagues on high\-intensity interval training added significantly to the emerging evidence base for the health benefits of performing very vigorous intensity activity in short bouts interspersed with periods of rest or recovery, which led directly to this form of activity being incorporated as an option into the final recommendation for adults” \[5.1\]. 

 Our research has also informed changes to publicly available guidelines on the management of jet lag. The underpinning research provided a completely new insight into jet lag management and was critical of laboratory simulation studies \(including animal studies\) claiming ‘cures’ for jet lag. Prior to the impact of our research, recommendations for managing jet lag symptoms from multiple authoritative sources contained several non\-evidenced claims about treatments and did not focus directly on circadian rhythm disturbances, tending to confuse jet lag and travel fatigue. Following the publication of our critical review and meta\-analysis \[3.3\], we completed an audit of guidelines on jet lag management in the public domain. Guidelines from the following bodies and authorities were scrutinised: The Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\), The National Health Service \(NHS\) Health A\-Z Portal, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\), and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\). We contacted all these authorities enquiring whether they would like us to help formulate guidelines that have a more robust evidence base. We separated those approaches with a good evidence base, for example, appropriately timed light exposure, from those with a weak evidence base \(e.g., dietary manipulation\) and sent the research to these authorities to support our enquires. 

 Previously, jet lag guidelines were not underpinned by robust evidence from studies in humans. Our research led directly to new guidelines from the following authorities, informed by high\-grade evidence. The CDC is the leading national public health institute in the USA. Their ‘Yellow Book’ is published every two years as the definitive reference for health professionals providing care to international travellers and is also a useful resource for any member of the public interested in staying healthy abroad. We co\-produced the new 2018 and 2020 guidelines for travel health with a Health Communications Specialist at the CDC. Our research \[3.3 and 3.4\] was cited and informed changes to the previous guidance \[5.5\]. For example, it was advised in 2016 to “spend time in the afternoon sun”, which was revised to more specific advice on light exposure, including referral to our study on supplemental bright light \[3.4\]. As of February 2019, views for the jet lag page in 2019 and 2020 \(1 Jan\-21 Oct\) were 11,160 and 10,781 respectively \[5.5\]. 

 Similar changes, informed by our research findings \[3.3 and 3.4\], have also been made to the jet lag guidelines produced by the following UK authorities. Working with the UK Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\), we co\-produced new guidelines with the Head of Aviation Health Unit at the CAA and a Specialist at KLM Airways Health Services. These guidelines were made available on the CAA website \[5.6\]. The Head of Aviation Health Unit at the CAA has confirmed ‘that the information on the link on the CAA website is based on the publication Atkinson G, et al., From animal cage to aircraft cabin: an overview of evidence translation in jet lag research. European Journal of Applied Physiology, 2014. 114\(12\): p. 2459\-2468’ \[5.7\]. 

 The NHS Health A\-Z Portal \(previously <ins>NHS Choices Health A\-Z</ins>\) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) have also revised their guidelines on managing jet lag \[5.8, 5.10\]. We reviewed the <ins>NHS Choices Health A\-Z</ins> guidelines as part of a topic review, with reference 3.3 informing the revisions to the NHS Health A\-Z Portal \[5.8\]. This work was acknowledged with a formal letter from the Reviews Editor for Health A\-Z which clearly stated that \[3.3\] ‘was used as a source for the review’ \[5.9\]. In 2019 we co\-produced the Clinical Knowledge Summary \(CKS\) for jet lag management. Our research \[3.3 and 3.4\] is cited in the references for the summary and forms part of the evidence base underpinning the specific recommendations. In his testimonial the Medical Director and Editor for Clinical Knowledge Summaries wrote that “We at Clarity Informatics are very happy to confirm that Professor Atkinson and his colleagues, Prof. Batterham and Dr. Thompson, were instrumental in providing this content and feedback for the jet lag topic” \[5.11\]. 

 Overall, our research has informed and changed national and international evidence\-based public health guidelines on both physical activity and jet lag.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Sir Paul Preston’s research has had significant impact on Spain's public discourse and national understanding of the Civil War, helping its people come to terms with the nation's history, and altering popular perception of some of its prominent figures. Preston’s work has informed educational initiatives in Catalonia and been honoured for its contributions to peace and reconciliation. Beyond Spain, his scholarship has been used to design an innovative professional development initiative for the British Army, and improved understanding and informed reporting of Spanish history among international audiences. During the REF assessment period Preston also received a knighthood for his services to UK/Spain relations. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The core of Professor Sir Paul Preston’s research is a succession of single\-authored monographs and peer\-reviewed journal articles, based on critical scrutiny of the primary source materials available \(particularly\) in Spain and the UK. Working originally on the social origins of the Civil War during the Second Republic, Preston subsequently broadened his investigation to the Civil War itself and the Franco dictatorship, and then to the restoration of democracy and the entirety of modern Spanish history. Relevant previous publications include a history of the Spanish Civil War \(updated across regular subsequent editions\) and authoritative biographies of General Franco and King Juan Carlos. The underpinning research described here builds upon those foundations. 

 *A People Betrayed* **\[1\]** provides a new, comprehensive, and authoritative political history of Spain from the monarchical restoration in 1876 to the abdication of King Juan Carlos in 2014. Copiously referenced, it took more than six years to prepare and draws on a lifetime of work. It highlights the contrast between the Spanish people and their ruling authorities, as traced through successive cycles of political corruption and incompetence and the dire consequences for social cohesion. A central theme is the conflict between the political centre and regional separatism, including the Madrid\-Catalonia relationship. 

 *The Last Days of the Spanish Republic* **\[2\]** reinterprets the closing phase of the Civil War, focusing on the military coup against the Republican Government led by Colonel Segismundo Casado. It corrects the prevailing interpretation, based on Casado’s memoirs, that the coup was justified and necessary to prevent futile slaughter. It absolves Prime Minister Juan Negrín from responsibility for the coup, which, in reality, closed off opportunities for a negotiated solution and thereby contributed to tens of thousands of deaths. 

 *The Last Stalinist* **\[3\]** reappraises Santiago Carrillo, who led the Spanish Communist Party between 1960 and 1982. It corrects many myths that Carrillo himself propagated. It shows that he was partly responsible for the mass executions of political prisoners as the rebel armies approached Madrid in late 1936: the worst Republican atrocity during the Civil War. Far from being blameless for the Madrid atrocities, Carrillo helped to organise them, as well as being complicit in the deaths of numerous Communist Party rivals during the Franco dictatorship. 

 *The Spanish Holocaust* **\[4\]** recounts in chilling and authoritative detail the summary and extra\-judicial killings of some 200,000 people by both sides \(though three times more by the Nationalists than the Republicans\) during and after the Civil War. The book also covers the cursory military trials, torture, systematic abuse of women and children, sweeping imprisonment, and horrors of exile. Those culpable for crimes committed on both sides of the Civil War are named; their victims identified. The culmination of more than a decade of research, Preston's analysis is supported by 120 pages of endnotes. 

 *The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution, Revenge* **\[5\]** vividly recounts the political ideals and military horrors of the Spanish Civil War \(including the controversial bombing of Guernica\), analyses the wider implications of the revolution in the Republican zone, tracks the emergence of Franco's brutal \(and, ultimately, extraordinarily durable\) fascist dictatorship, and assesses the ways in which the Spanish Civil War was a portent of the Second World War that ensued so rapidly after it. 

 In research also underpinning impacts described here, Preston reappraises the veracity of George Orwell’s *Homage to Catalonia* **\[6\]**, arguing it demonstrates little understanding of Spanish or Catalan politics and does not present a reliable analysis of the broader politics of the war and its international determinants. Its underlying notion that the crushing of revolution in Barcelona would contribute to the eventual Republican defeat makes it too easy to forget the contributions to that defeat made by Franco, Hitler, Mussolini, and the self\-interest of the British, French, and American governments.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Following the death of General Franco in 1975, Spain’s political elites agreed to *el pacto del olvido* \(“the pact of forgetting”\), a conscious decision not to address the legacy of Francoism as a way of smoothening the transition to democracy. While this pact served a useful purpose at the time, conversation surrounding the Civil War and the regime subsequently became inhibited, preventing Spain and its people from confronting and accepting its past. It is in this context that Preston’s research, particularly the monographs described above, has made significant contributions to processes of reconciliation and commemoration in Spain. Findings from Preston’s work have challenged previous national understandings of events and personalities, correcting misapprehensions and outright falsehoods, while his research has also informed an award\-winning educational initiative in Catalonia. Internationally, his work has improved understanding and informed discussion of Spain’s recent history, and been used to design an innovative professional development initiative for British Army staff. 

 **Contributions to reconciliation and commemoration in Spain** 

 During the current REF assessment period, Preston has been recognised not only for the rigour and authority of his research on the Spanish Civil War and modern Spanish history, but also for his influence beyond academia. This is evidenced by a succession of honours and awards. 

 In 2019, Preston was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Universidad de Cantabria. Endorsing the decision to bestow this award, Professor Julián Casanova of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, paid tribute to Preston’s wider cultural and social impact: “ *your labour is also outstanding for your contribution to the construction of a critical and democratic consciousness that has guided the actions of numerous politicians, disciples, academic colleagues and the tens of thousands of readers of your extensive oeuvre. Your work had academic consequences and a social and human influence that is very rare among university teachers*” **\[A\]**. 

 Indeed, as outlined above, Preston’s research has been particularly important in its contributions to a nation which had previously struggled to confront its difficult past. Citing *A People Betrayed* **\[1\]** specifically, Antoni Bassas Onieva, the Catalan broadcaster and a recipient of the National Prize for Journalism, has attested to how “ *the works of Sir Paul Preston have succeeded in breaking the so\-called 'pact of forgetting*'” **\[B\]**, while economist and historian Ángel Viñas celebrates the book **\[1\]** for having “ *opened up new ways of exploring the Spanish past*” **\[C\]**. On the same theme but this time citing *The Spanish Holocaust* **\[4\]** and its charting of Francoists’ distortions of history, Viñas says Preston’s research has gone “ *some way towards filling the gap left by the failure of successive governments to initiate a truth and reconciliation process*” **\[C\]**. About the same book **\[4\]**, former Spanish Ambassador to the UK \(2008\-12\), Carles Casajuana has described it as “ *a key instrument for all Spaniards wishing to come to terms with one of the darkest aspects of our history*” **\[D\]**. 

 A more illustrative and intimate example is in the 2019 letter Preston received from a Spanish psychologist and psychotherapist. This letter described a family whose grandfather had been murdered by Francoist forces during the Civil War. After reading *The Spanish Holocaust* **\[4\]**, his granddaughter persuaded the family to break its silence, discuss the murder, and commemorate the victim. The letter goes on to note "" *the beneficial effect that reading **\[4\]** had in a Spanish family that, like so many others, suffered the effects of the collective trauma constituted by the war. Thank you for your extraordinary work in helping to illuminate the complex history of Spain*"" **\[E\]**. 

 **Challenges to conventional wisdom and changing popular perception of historical figures** 

 A feature of Preston’s research on Spanish modern history and the Civil War is how it has challenged conventional national understandings, prompting debate amongst the people of Spain. Casajuana says that in *The Last Days of the Spanish Republic* **\[2\]**, Preston “ *has shed light on essential aspects of our recent past and rectified long\-held assumptions*” **\[D\]**. Similarly, the rigour and novelty of the Preston research **\[6\]** has led to a reappraisal of George Orwell’s *Homage to Catalonia*, the most\-sold and most\-read book on the Civil War. As covered by Carles Geli in Spanish daily newspaper *El País*, the research finds Orwell’s account to be deeply flawed as a historical record, influenced by his acceptance of the partisan views of anarchist and POUM comrades as well as his ignorance of the wider context **\[F\]**. Biographies of Santiago Carrillo **\[3\]** and King Juan Carlos I \(2004\) have proven similarly instrumental in correcting long\-held misinformation about their subjects, as attested to by Vinas: “\[ *these biographies\] have significantly altered popular perception of those figures*” **\[C\]**. 

 **Contributions to Catalan culture** 

 Preston’s research has had particularly notable cultural impacts in Catalonia. Bassas Onieva has observed how his influence extends beyond the \(Castilian\) Spanish\-speaking population, “ *but also to that expressed in the country's other official languages, such as Catalan, the language of Gaudi, Miro, Dali and which Picasso also spoke*” **\[B\]**. In 2016, as part of the City of Barcelona Awards of 2015, Preston was awarded the Premi de Projecció Internacional de la Ciutat de Barcelona \- the City of Barcelona Prize for International Projection. Reporting on this award for *El País*, Blanca Cia paid tribute to Preston’s “ *commitment \[to\] the recovery of the historical memory \[of\] the city*"" **\[G\]**. In the same year, Preston was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Barcelona. Reporting for Catalan newspaper *El Nacional*, Albert Acín hailed the importance of recognising Preston in this way “ *because he has always been characterised by the defence of Catalonia and its language and culture*”, also citing his support for Catalonia’s right to self\-determination **\[H\]**. 

 **Contributions to educational initiatives** 

 In 2016, Preston collaborated with best\-selling Spanish cartoonist José Pablo García to adapt *The Spanish Civil War* **\[5\]** into a graphic novel for publication in Spain. The objective of García's illustrative history was to offer new generations, or those who have no idea about or previously had much interest in it, an accurate portrait of what happened during the Civil War years **\[I\]**. Preston reviewed the proofs ahead of publication to ensure their accuracy and advised on minor corrections. The graphic history was published in 2016, rising to number three in the Spanish bestseller list. More than 15,000 copies have been sold and an eighth edition is in preparation **\[J\]**. Copies have been distributed to every library in the Valencia province to which children have access, while the book has received a communal library award and was also featured in an exhibition of the Provincial Historical Archive of Alicante, entitled “Images of democratic memory: the comic as a teaching resource”. *Público* paid tribute to García's work as “ *a common account of the tragedy that serves to preserve the true memory of those days*” **\[K\]**. 

 In 2017, Preston and García renewed their collaboration on *The Destruction of Guernica* \( *La Muerte de Guernica*\), also adapted from **\[5\]** and again with the intention of raising children’s historical awareness. Preston contributed additional new passages and original material from his research **\[L\]**. In 2019, Preston was one of three historians to receive the prestigious Guernica Award for Peace and Reconciliation, “ *for their work to bring to light the truth of the bombing of Guernica*” **\[M\]**. 

 The research made further contributions to teaching when, in 2018, an interview with Preston about Catalonia was included in a new distance\-learning module on Modern Political Ideas developed by the Open University. This module will run from 2019 to 2029, with 181 and 229 students having enrolled over its first two years. The Preston interview will also appear on the Open University’s public learning platform, Open Learn. 

 **Contributions to continuing professional development – the British Army** 

 This research has also been used to inform military training programmes. In 2017, the British Army commissioned Preston to prepare historical background briefs ahead of the Headquarters Army Recruitment and Training Division \(ARTD\) strategic Battlefield Training Study to the Ebro and Barcelona. This study was to form part of a “staff ride”, a common ARTD exercise, in which officers visited the terrain of the 1938 Battle of the Ebro, the largest of the Spanish conflict. Drawing on his history of the Civil War **\[5\]**, Preston met with representatives of the ARTD and provided briefings on the political context, the military strategy of both sides, and the international dimension. Major Caroline Way, writing on behalf of the ARTD, noted how Preston’s “ *expert guidance \[and\] recommendations*” helped her to design the study and were “ *essential to set the context for the historical outcomes of the Spanish Civil War*” **\[N\]**. All resources and advice provided by Preston were captured in a post\-exercise report, which has been shared across the Army, with Way further commenting that “ *this will therefore be of benefit to many more British Army personnel in the future*” **\[N\]**. 

 **Contributions to public discourse in Spain** 

 Preston’s research is well\-known to the Spanish public, having been cited in newspapers of all political persuasions and across the country’s different regions and languages. Since 2014, Google data shows it has been mentioned in the media more than 1,500 times overall, including 140\+ times in *El País*, 150\+ times in *La Vanguardia*, 60\+ times in *ABC,* and 40\+ times in *El Mundo*. His contributions are notable for having been solicited by both the Madrid\-leaning and the Catalonia\-leaning press, and this acceptance as a non\-partisan voice has ensured his interventions are viewed as trusted and authoritative, as noted by Bassas Onieva: “ *the fact of not being Spanish has given Preston's thesis a distinctive, fresh distance, necessary and appreciated when treating the most painful and recent chapters of the country's history*” **\[B\]**. 

 Notable contributions to the public discourse since 2013 include his interviews discussing the abdication of King Juan Carlos I; the renewed public focus on former dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, prompted by publication of **\[1\]**; and the contentious debate over the exhumation of General Franco, which was brough into sharper focus by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez’s 2018 announcement that Franco’s remains would be exhumed from the Valle de los Caídos. Interviews with Preston \- in which he supported the case for removing Franco’s remains from the mausoleum and drew an equivalence of having a monument to Hitler in Berlin – were featured in *El Diario*, *El Nacional,* and *El Confidencial*, publicising his mooted solution that Franco be buried at sea **\[O\]**. A further interview was published in *El País* following the order by Spain’s High Court to halt the exhumation in 2019 **\[O\]**. 

 **Contributions to international understanding of Spanish history** 

 Internationally, Preston is regularly sought for comment on Spanish affairs. In the UK, he was chosen by the BBC to explain Franco’s long legacy in post\-transition Spain and its continuing influence on modern Spanish politics. Amidst the backdrop of the debate over Catalan independence, including the 2017 referendum and subsequent declaration of independence, he wrote explainers on the issue for *The Times* and again appeared on the BBC, discussing its historical origins and context and drawing on research for **\[1\]**. More widely, contributions emanating from his research have featured in *Le Monde* \(France\), discussing Catalan independence; in *La Tercera* \(Chile\), the *Irish Times*, and the *New York Times*, and also in broadcasts by ZDF \(Germany\) and Belarussian television, discussing the continuing legacy of Franco, including the possible exhumation; in *Diario de Notícias* \(Portugal\), on Santiago Carillo; and in *Folha de S.Paulo* \(Brazil\), discussing the abdication of King Juan Carlos I **\[P\]**. 

 **Services to UK\-Spanish relations** 

 Lastly, in 2018, in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List, Preston was awarded a Knighthood, being recognised in the diplomatic service and overseas list for his services to UK/Spain relations **\[Q\]**.

1.  **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UAL has supported its researchers working across the University in the development of  cross\-disciplinary and participatory partnerships with museums, galleries, archives and collections. These external projects engage in the critical examination of the processes of collecting, curating and displaying cultural artefacts, creating interventions that have long\-term impact, leaving a legacy at the partner institutions. Through the examination of ways in which narratives are constructed, the research has produced creative interventions into these institutions’ collections, which have impacted on public and professional understanding of archives and collections through revising the way objects and displays are understood. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A key project in setting the agenda for this area of research at UAL was **Hogan**’s *The Currency of Art* \[3.1.\] *,* a six\-year collaboration with ING Bank that brought together researchers in an institutionally supported collective project with the Baring Archive \(a collection of archival material relating to finance and the history of Barings\) to consider methods of examining and working in archives, and to interrogate the roles artists might play in developing better public understanding of an archive or collection. The project focused on how the arts and business communities might engage productively to interpret and reframe the Baring Archive. 

 Key exemplars of research methods such as public co\-curation and museum experiences are found in the work of **Boyce**, **Wynne**, **Coldwell** and **Morra**, all of whom are seen as representing important practice research in this field. **Boyce**’s practice involves working collaboratively, often with an element of improvisation, in order to explore power relations particularly around class, gender, race and sexuality. Notably, she has explored art as a social practice and addressed the construction of power relations in the making and display of artwork in *The Future is Social* \(2011\) \[3.2\]. This project focused on collaborative and participatory practice in art, examining the notion of ownership in relation to art created through collaboration, which might include that produced whilst working in an archive or collection. 

 In *Transplant and Life* \(2017\), commissioned by Royal College of Surgeons’ Hunterian Museum, a direct result of the ‘Transplant’ project \(Harefield Hospital, 2006–2007\) \[3.3\], sound artist **Wynne** brought to his collaboration with the late photographer Tim Wainwright his long\-standing research into socially engaged and cross\-cultural sound arts practice. During this period as artist\-in\-residence at London’s Royal Free Hospital, **Wynne** extended his exploration of multi\-channel installation to examine how to use sound to influence the physical movement of audiences and enhance their experience in gallery and museum spaces, exploring new relationships between sound and still image, and between still and moving image. The work aimed to raise awareness of the issues around organ transplantation and of the varied experiences of patients and donors. 

 **Coldwell’s** research focuses on revealing hidden meaning and content in order to create new understanding and insights. He introduces site\-specific art interventions into ‘personality’ museums, in order to think about how ‘absences’ can be made manifest through making. Bringing practice\-based archival research into the collection at Kettle’s Yard, in *I Called When You Were Out* \(2008\) \[3.4\], the sculptor/printmaker uncovered the stories of selected objects from the archive. Responsive to aspects of the house and collection, and reflecting on the presence and absence of domestic life there, Coldwell made a series of bronze sculptures, prints and a film. The work echoed previous approaches to absence, memory and loss developed by **Coldwell** when working with the Freud Museum London in the 1990s. This way of working has evolved as part of a long and sustained engagement with collections including those at V&A, Scott Polar Research Institute and the Freud Museums in London and Vienna, in which the artist has adopted an embedded approach, spending considerable time with the collections and museum staff, to evolve a sense of what might be missing or edited out and, from this, creating new bodies of work. 

 In *Saying It* \(2012\) \[3.5\], **Morra** used her research into theories of psychoanalysis, as they relate to creative production, to explore artists’ roles working within a particular collection—the Freud Museum London. The project continued **Morra**’s interrogation of the notion of ‘site\-responsivity’, a research method that defines how an exhibition can make a critical intervention into a site that activates meanings through a dialogue between the site, the works of art, the artists and the visitors. The project was an experiment in audio\-visual storytelling through which each visitor was immersed in a psychoanalytic process and could infer their own meaning.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 UAL has supported its researchers to develop external partnerships to produce work in specific contexts of key museums, galleries, collections and archives. Those selected for this case study present the breadth of types of intervention as a method for change employed by UAL researchers and are indicative of the University’s success in this area. 

 Acknowledging **Boyce**’s long\-term collaborative and often performative practice, to stage critical interventions in institutional archives and cultural memory, Manchester Art Gallery \(MAG\) commissioned the artist to research, develop and produce a site\-specific evening of performances to encourage public engagement with the gallery’s permanent collection as part of their ongoing ‘The Gallery Takeover’ series of events. As part of one ‘act’ of the artist’s *Six Acts* project \(2018\), **Boyce** worked alongside staff at the gallery to interrogate its curatorial practice as it stood at that point. The artist initiated a discussion about the curation of a gallery called ‘In Pursuit of Beauty’. As a result of the debate, it was decided, collectively, to remove one painting temporarily—John William Waterhouse’s, *Hylas and the Nymphs* \(1896\)—explaining that its removal was in order to prompt discussion. Public response for and against the initiative followed across a range of media types, with events at the gallery organised to enable deeper investigation of the issues. Some 927 comments were posted on the MAG website comments page, including: “Removing a painting for seven days has caused it to be seen by a vastly larger audience than would otherwise have been the case. It’s the opposite of censorship. It’s display plus a fanfare of drums and trumpets”. \[5.1.\] *The Guardian’*s Jonathan Jones confronted the debate in a series of articles; readers’ letters continued the discussion. \[5.2.\] \[5.3.\] “The painting was removed for just a week, but in that time accusations of censorship and virtue\-signalling dominated local and national discourse. Comments ranged from calling the move “vitally important” and “courageous”, to “a trite PC gesture” that was “born out of the same impulse as book burning”. \[5.4.\] The debate is ongoing—in late November 2020, **Boyce** gave the annual Andrew Carnegie Lecture for Edinburgh College of Art in which she discussed the important nuances of the controversy arising from the removal of the painting \(audience: over 300\). The Contemporary Arts Society acquired *Six Acts* after the exhibition \(2018\). 

 *The Currency of Art* is an important example of UAL’s strategic plan to invest time and resource to create partnerships with other institutions to increase the external impact of the work of its fine artists, and the ideas being explored. The project generated creative responses to the Baring Archive, culminating in exhibitions hosted by ING Bank, including *re:searching* \(2010\), in which the works produced were exhibited alongside the historical works that inspired them. Participants including pupils from three local secondary schools, and UAL students and staff brought fresh perspectives, distinct from those of financial historians or more traditional academics. This work led to a centrally funded, cross\-departmental research network around artist interactions with museums and archives and, subsequently, to two large international conferences supported by the University: *Im/material: Encounters within the Creative Arts Archive* \(2016\) and the later *Archives & Embodiment* \(2019\). This group worked in particular across the University’s Professoriate, holding regular internal events and talks to explore thematic and theoretical issues that could underpin developments in approach and methodology in this area of work. The collaboration resulted in a UAL PhD student working on *Socialising The Archive*, based around the Baring Archive \(funded by a Rootstein Hopkins Research Scholarship\). **Hogan** gave papers at *Geographies of Collections* \(Royal Geographical Society Annual Conference: The Geographical Imagination, 2013\) and *Creating Art From a Living Archive* \(Past Is Prologue Conference, Goldsmiths, University of London, 2014\). 

 Further developing the work on absence so important to his residency at Kettles Yard, **Coldwell**’s *Freud’s Coat* project *, Temporarily Accessioned: Freud’s Coat Revisited* \(2017\), returned to the Freud Museum, London. As part of this stage of the exhibition, **Coldwell** arranged for the coat bought by Freud for his journey to London in 1938 to be x\-rayed by the National Gallery to provide the data for a life\-size digital print, called *Temporarily Accessioned\-X\-Ray*. The work raises issues around attitudes to contemporary migration. \(Audience figures: Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna—22,630 visitors; Freud Museum London—6,400 visitors\). \[5.5.\] The artists’ book, *Temporarily Accessioned,* has been acquired by galleries including The National Gallery, Tate and Victoria State Library. More recently, **Coldwell** has continued his work around uncovering meaning through a further AHRC\-funded research network \(GBP30,498.00\), *Picturing the Invisible*, which brings together key research academics from subjects as disparate as astrophysics, philosophy, printmaking, psychoanalysis, surgery, forensics and fine art, to examine how they imagine and manifest ‘the invisible’ from within their own disciplines. 

 **Morra**’s 2018 book, *Inside the Freud Museum: History, Memory and Site\-responsive Art* \(International Library of Modern and Contemporary Art\) offers a nuanced analysis of the Freud Museums in Vienna and London and their unique relationships to contemporary art, giving a new perspective of the history and practice of psychoanalysis, of museums and of contemporary art. The concept of ‘site\-responsivity’, in particular, has had considerable impact and the book has been widely praised by senior academics and theoreticians. “ **Morra**… demonstrates the fruitfulness of revising the relationship between site and the art installed there. The concept \[of ‘site\-responsivity’\] will transform our thinking about that special spatiality without which art cannot reach its audiences.” \(Mieke Bal, 2018\). The book has been described as “impressive and thoughtful… For anyone interested in the pervasive influence of Freudian psychoanalytic ideas within conceptual art, this is an important read”. \(Caroline A. Jones, 2018\). \[5.6.\] An element of **Coldwell**’s *Picturing the Invisible* was a solo exhibition at the Sir John Soane’s Museum in London \(2020\). **Coldwell** has been described as “a past master of this type of site\-responsive exhibition… Taking his cue from the show’s setting—the basement kitchens of the famous architect’s grand house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields—Coldwell imagined how the unknown cooks and servants who laboured there, out of sight and beyond the pale of cultural history, might have perceived their master’s lofty endeavours”. \[5.7.\] 

 Medical museums and clinical settings are places where the patient voice is often absent. For *Transplant and Life*, **Wynne** was asked to bring the patient voice—in all its diversity—into the medical museum, a space normally dominated by specimens, clinical hardware and medical ‘heroes’. Filming, photographing and recording a total of 29 participants—organ transplant recipients, live donors, people on the waiting list for a transplant—as well as specialists, **Wynne**’s intervention created an aural and visual body of work. The project also revisited participants from the earlier *Transplant* project, generating a unique longitudinal qualitative study of transplant recipients \(with additional support from Royal Brompton and Harefield Arts\). The project contributed to both the professional and the public understanding of the experience of receiving—or waiting for—an organ transplant. *The Lancet* described how: “Clare Marx, the Royal College of Surgeon’s first female President, spoke feelingly at the launch of how proud she felt to have the testimony of patients put centre\-stage, within such hallowed walls, for the very first time. She is right to claim that this modest exhibition is ‘the jewel in the crown’ of what the RCS has to offer. In proclaiming what matters most to surgeons is their patients, Marx makes a gesture on behalf of our whole community, one that is important and certainly long overdue”. \[5.8.\] One of the surgeons that **Wynne** worked with wrote “In terms of what I have learned, it is perhaps the depth of the impact that having a transplant has on a patient and their family. In the day\-to\-day ward work, we don’t really get a chance to sit down and think about the impact… we pay lip service to it, but do we really think about it deeply? This work certainly allows us to do this.” When one Harefield patient heard some of **Wynne**’s recordings, they commented, “I wish someone had told me some of this before I had my transplant”. \[5.9.\] 

 Approximately 50,000 people visited the exhibition. \(Online exhibition visitor numbers: 272,405 page views and 23,427 unique views.\) In part, the online element was to ensure that the Museum had a presence during the closure of the Royal College of Surgeons building for major refurbishment. Exhibition reviews and related articles appeared in the *British Medical Journal* \( *BMJ*\), *Journal of the American College of Cardiology* and *The Lancet*. One visitor described the exhibition as “such an informative and viscerally moving exhibit. I have been taken to a different head space and have been exposed to so many new points of view”. \[5.10.\] One patient explained how the act of talking about her kidney transplant to **Wynne** for the project helped both her and her husband to think about the transplant experience itself: “It’s actually a really great experience for me because … I’d never thought about it or talked about it before. And the pictures were there but I’d never … *looked* at them … it was kind of cathartic.” \[5.11.\] The exhibition was selected as part of the international SEAD collection \(Multidisciplinary Exemplars of Science, Engineering, Art, Design and Humanities\) as an exemplar of how artists can provide a new human perspective to scientific and technological issues. \[5.12.\] Beyond the quantitative data, the nature of the project means that much of the impact was at a personal, intimate level—patients, families and medical staff. Dissemination took place through a six\-month series of events around the project, including presentations at ‘Encountering Pain: hearing, seeing, speaking’ conference, University College London, 2016; ‘The Sound of Feelings’, presentation at Rethinking Sound 2018, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea; ‘Transplant and Life: Memory, pain and emotion in the patient voice’, presentation at The Sound of Memory Symposium: Sound\-track/Sound\-scape, Goldsmiths, University of London; ‘The Intersection of Research and Practice’, keynote address at Research and Innovation: Practice\-related Research Conference at Southampton Solent University; and an artist’s talk at the Royal College of Surgeons library, introduced by Clare Marx, President, RCS.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Huntington’s Disease \(HD\) is a neurodegenerative disease with no curative treatment options. Research by Cardiff’s Huntington’s Disease Group provided the first quantitative evidence that physiotherapy and regular supported physical activity were beneficial for people with HD. The findings were the catalyst for the first physiotherapy guidelines for HD, and for the subsequent inclusion of physiotherapy as a key intervention in HD management guidelines used across eight European nations and internationally. From 2015, Cardiff researchers also supported the annual accredited course to UK HD health professionals \(via the HD Association\), as well as development of patient resources now used internationally \(e.g. by the Chinese HD Association\). These were particularly vital during the COVID pandemic when many HD clinical services were paused. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Huntington’s Disease \(HD\) is a progressive neurological disorder that causes uncontrolled movements, loss of cognitive ability, as well as irritability, depression and other mood changes. The most common monogenetic, neurodegenerative disease worldwide, it affects 12 people in every 100,000. The personal, social and economic consequences of HD are devastating; for example, the cost of treating the 9,000 people with HD in the UK equates to £195M every year. 

 Prior to Cardiff research, there was no standard guidance for the use of physiotherapy, including home exercise, in HD treatment. Consequently, physiotherapists working with HD patients primarily relied on clinical judgement rather than evidence\-informed guidelines for treatment planning. Professor Ed Wild, Associate Director of the UCL Huntington’s Disease Centre confirms: “ *most community physiotherapy teams…\[had\] little to no experience of the very specific and unusual physical and cognitive impairments that HD patients can display”* with many clinicians tending to “ *underestimate the potential benefits of physiotherapy in these patients”* **\[5.1a\]**. 

 To address this knowledge gap, Busse and Rosser undertook a series of research studies, randomized control trials, and a systematic review designed to assess the efficacy of physiotherapy interventions for people with HD, and whether those delivered positive physical, cognitive and / or social benefits. 

 **2.1 Physiotherapy as an intervention in HD:** Busse and Rosser sought to characterise physiotherapy practice for people with HD in order to develop a standardised framework for patient management that could support clinical care. Through a mixed methods study, the research found that **\[3.1\]**: 

-  physiotherapy outcome measures were underused to assess efficacy of care; 

-  physiotherapy itself was underused, particularly in the early stages of the disease; 

-  management of falls and mobility deficit progression is core to treatment of people with HD. 

 This research supported development of a new consensus framework for physiotherapy in the care of HD patients, importantly highlighting that clinical practice should be developed according to the disease stage of progression **\[3.1\]**. 

 **2.2 Outcome measures for physical functioning:** Having highlighted the importance of falls management as a preventive treatment goal, the team also carried out a global validation study for HD performance\-based outcome measures **\[G3.1\]**, assessing 11 items \(e.g., 6 Minute Walk Test distance, Physical Performance Test \(PPT\), Barthel Index\) across different stages of disease progression. The research identified that the Berg Balance Scale \(BBS\) and Timed “Up & Go Test” \(TUG\) were the most appropriate tools for practitioner assessment of a patient’s risk of falling **\[3.2\]**. They also found that the PPT had excellent utility as an effective outcome measure of physical ability. These three tests were highlighted as appropriate measures for clinical trials testing interventions focused on improving physical functioning in people with HD **\[3.2\]**. 

 **2.3 Exercise as an intervention:** In 2012, the Cardiff team conducted the first ever randomized controlled trial \(RCT\) of a physiotherapy intervention in patients with early to mid\-stage HD **\[3.3\]**. The intervention \(a home exercise DVD, *Move to Exercise*\) improved movement outcomes \(e.g., gait speed, balance, function and level of activity\) in HD patients, compared to a control group. Building on this work, in 2013, the researchers undertook a further randomized control trial into a gym\-based exercise intervention \(supplemented by a home walking programme\) **\[3.4, G3.2\]**. The trial demonstrated improvements in participants’ physical ability, as well as in their mental health **\[3.4\]**. The study was awarded the *Journal of Neurological Physical Therapy*’s prize for the best publication of 2013, based on its contribution to knowledge, design and implementation of physiotherapy practice. In 2013, the team used the findings from these two trials to develop the ENGAGE\-HD intervention and workbook \(revised in 2020\) **\[G3.3\]**. These trials showed that a physiotherapy intervention was feasible, and coaching could improve motivation, physical activity, and cognition in people with HD **\[3.5\]**. 

 **2.4 Systematic review of HD and physiotherapy:** A subsequent systematic review of evidence\-based clinical management of HD using physiotherapy, based on 18 studies, found that physiotherapy interventions are of benefit to HD patients, both in terms of physical and mental health, but that heterogeneity of outcome measures used across studies remained a limitation to drawing comparative conclusions from the various studies **\[3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cardiff’s research on physiotherapy and physical activity as a positive treatment intervention in HD led to evidence\-based national and international guidelines on physiotherapy interventions for HD, as well as training for UK HD health professionals via the Huntington’s Disease Association. The research also led to patient resources for physical activity, now being used internationally, including during the COVID\-19 lockdown. 

###  International physiotherapy and multi\-disciplinary guidelines for HD 

 **a. The European Physiotherapy Clinical Guidelines** 

 Just prior to the current REF period, the Cardiff team authored the first standardised physiotherapy guidelines for HD, based on the Cardiff research **\[**see **3.1 \- 3.5\]**: the European Physiotherapy Clinical Guidelines, published in English by the European Huntington’s Disease Network \(EHDN\) in June 2013. During this REF period, these were subsequently translated into eight European languages: Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian and Polish, providing HD consultants across Europe with access to evidence\-based clinical guidance which they have promoted to other healthcare professionals and patients. 

 For example, Professor Ed Wild, Associate Director of the UCL Huntington’s Disease Centre, noted how he used the guidelines: “ *I refer to the guidance in almost every clinic letter I write to GPs*… *On numerous occasions I have received feedback from patients that the therapists found the \[EHDN guidelines\] document informative and practically helpful, generally resulting in improved outcomes from the patient’s perspective”* **\[5.1a\]**. Hanne Ludt Fossmo, physiotherapist at the Vikersund Bad Rehabilitation Centre in Norway, also noted that *“we have used the translated version whenever we are in contact with new patients”,* and that *“they are beneficial especially for physiotherapists that have not been in contact with HD, and for newly diagnosed patients”* **\[5.1b\]** *.* 

 **b. Influencing HD guidelines worldwide** 

 The European Physiotherapy Clinical Guidelines, and outcomes from Cardiff research, laid the foundation for further inclusion of key recommendations on physiotherapy interventions in significant clinical guidelines for HD management, including: 

1.  **British Medical Journal** Huntington’s Disease Best Practice Guideline** \(April 2018\) **\[5.2a\]**, which draws upon Cardiff’s home\-based exercise research **\[3.4\]** and advises that “Home exercise programmes have been shown to improve physical function” **\[5.2a,** p20 **\]**. 

1.  **The International Guidelines for the Treatment of Huntington’s Disease**, were  developed between 2015\-2018, and published in 2019 **\[5.2b\]**. The Guidelines provide global, evidence\-based recommendations for everyday clinical practice which standardise all aspects of HD treatment \(pharmacological, surgical and non\-pharmacological\) to improve the patient care and quality of life. The Guidelines list ten motor disorders seen in HD and recommend physiotherapy for five of them based on research from the Cardiff team **\[3.5\]**. 

1.  **Clinical Recommendations to Guide Physical Therapy Practice for Huntington’s Disease \[5.2c\]**, the first global, evidence\-based guidelines for physiotherapists to use with people with HD. Published in 2020 in *Neurology*, the Clinical Recommendations cite research papers by the Cardiff team **\[3.4, 3.5\]**, as well as their European Physiotherapy Clinical Guidelines. The Clinical Recommendations advocate physiotherapy as a key intervention in the management of HD\-related dystonia \(uncontrollable movement\), rigidity, gait and balance disorders, and for assisting with manual dexterity. The Clinical Recommendations were endorsed by the American Academy of Neurology **\[5.2c**, p72 **\]** and their publication drew considerable media attention, with podcasts, interviews, and press releases **\[5.3\]**. 

1.  **Clinical Practice Guidelines on Core Outcome Measures for Adults With Neurologic Impairment Undergoing Rehabilitation** **\[5.2d\]** used Cardiff’s research to promote the use of outcome measures \(e.g., use of the 6 minute Walk Test\) **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. The Guidelines were published by the American Physical Therapy Association \(APTA\), an organisation that represents more than 100,000 member physiotherapists, physiotherapist assistants, and students of physiotherapy across the United States. 

###  Training UK HD health professionals 

 Following their work on national and international HD guidelines, the Cardiff group collaborated with the Huntington’s Disease Association \(HDA\) of England and Wales to deliver an accredited health professionals’ course. This ran from 2015 onwards and has been attended by more than 250 HD health professionals. The Cardiff team used their research findings **\[3.1, 3.4, 3.5\]** to produce teaching materials and lead sessions on evidence\-based, person\-centered approaches to physiotherapy in HD. Course evaluations indicated greater awareness among participants of the positive benefits of physiotherapy and physical activity; feedback from the 2019 HDA course included: “ *Good information which I can relay to health professionals in our area to attempt early intervention*” and *“I am better equipped to support them \[patients with HD\] better with the knowledge I have gained through this course*” **\[5.4\]**. 

###  Patient resources for physical activity used internationally 

 The Cardiff team’s patient resources \(the *Move to Exercise* DVD **\[3.4\]**, and the workbook developed through the ENGAGE\-HD intervention **\[3.5\]**\) have been used by patients and clinicians internationally. The resources are available on the HDA’s website with 9,906 views by 6,368 individual users between 2019 and 2020 **\[5.5\]**. The materials have been translated into Arabic, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Chinese, and are being used by health professionals to support patients within these countries. For example, the Chinese materials have been distributed to more than 800 HD families \(each with an average of two HD patients\) across China to date, with one patient reporting “ *I know now that exercise is key to stay healthy*” **\[5.6\]**. Xi Cao, President of the Chinese Huntington’s Disease Association stated: “ *We find the exercise video and workbook a strong and practical tool to raise awareness in HD patients and families about importance of exercise and HD patients are using them. Your research into exercise and physiotherapy for management of HD has been very influential to us, and to the advice we give our members*” **\[5.6\]**. 

 Cardiff’s research also led the European Huntington Association \(EHA\), which supports over 30,000 people with HD, to initiate an exercise initiative, *HD on the Move*, to encourage exercise for people with HD **\[5.7a\].** Based on the research findings **\[3.4, 3.5\]**, *HD on the Move* encourages and supports HD patients in 28 European countries to be physically active for as long as possible. The initiative is now regularly featured in the programme of the annual EHA family meeting \(an annual event bringing together families of HD patients\) **\[5.7b**, p8, p12 **\]**. 

###  Supporting HD patients during the COVID\-19 pandemic 

 During the first national COVID\-19 lockdown, support services for UK HD patients were stopped, with some patients shielding throughout the pandemic. Similar measures were put in place in countries around the world, severely limiting opportunities for exercise. In response, Cardiff’s *Move to Exercise* \(Section 4.3\) was distributed via EHDN mailing lists and licensed for use by HD charity associations in Spain, Italy, Australia, Tasmania, Germany and Brazil **\[5.8a, b\]**. The Cardiff team delivered an online exercise session for people with HD in April 2020 with 34 HD attendees from the UK, USA, Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Ireland. 21 attendees rated the webinar as “ *very helpful*”. Feedback included a specialist personal trainer stating: “ *I am currently looking at how I can continue working with my HD clients,* \[after the closure of their facility through government restrictions\] *and now I can’t wait to do remote sessions*” and “ *At the moment we go out for a short walk each day, sometimes not far if X is in a lot of pain, so we can try some of the things suggested*” **\[5.8c\]**. Available via the UK HDA website, the webinar has received 191 views **\[5.8d, e\]**. 

 In summary, Cardiff’s research on the benefits of physiotherapy for HD changed international clinical practice guidelines, supported enhanced training for healthcare practitioners, and empowered patients to use exercise and physiotherapy to manage the physical symptoms of a degenerative disease with no other treatments. Astri Arnesen, Chief Executive of the UK Huntington’s Disease Association, stated that the improved access to expert physiotherapists and resources for people with HD has been “ *very influential in them maintaining their independence for as long as possible – and clearly improves their quality of life*” **\[5.9\]**.

 Professor Seabra’s early research funded by the Choroideremia Research Foundation and Fight for Sight led to discovery of the biochemical basis for choroideremia and the subsequent development of tests for its specific diagnosis. Seabra along with Robert MacLaren and Matt During then developed a first gene therapy vector \(NSR\-REP1\), leading to the first treatment trial and evidence for sustained arrest or significant improvement in vision for some of the patients treated. A successful spin\-out company, Nightstar Therapeutics was created on these foundations, with NSR\-REP1 as its lead programme. Nightstar gained significant investment, went public in 2017 and was subsequently acquired by Biogen in 2019 for approximately $800,000,000.

 Choroideremia is a rare disease of the eye affecting approximately 1 in 50,000 \(predominantly males\), causing progressive vision loss beginning usually in late childhood. The first signs are usually related to a loss of night vision \(night blindness\), followed by a reduction in the field of vision and a growing inability to discern details, depth and colour perception. This eventually leads to blindness in adulthood by the fourth decade. 

 The disease has long been without any cure. Choroideremia is caused by faults in the *CHM* gene. Professor Miguel Seabra, at Imperial College London, defined the biochemical basis for the disease for the first time, showing that a disease\-associated *CHM* gene defect causes a certain protein \- known as REP\-1 \- not to be produced in most cases.  Lack of this protein causes pigment cells in the retina of the eye to deteriorate, leading to damage to the eye tissue. *CHM* gene defects are inherited on the X\-chromosome, so that males are more likely to develop the condition in affected families, but females can pass the faulty *CHM* gene onto their children. 

 An important hurdle to developing a treatment was to learn where the disease starts in the retina. This could only be done by creating mouse models that could allow the course of the disease to be followed.  Seabra achieved this using a newly developed method which allowed the deletion of the *CHM* gene in distinct layers of the retina of a mouse \(called conditional mouse knock\-outs\) \(1\). Study of these models demonstrated that the retinal pigment epithelium \(RPE\) and photoreceptors degenerate independently. Importantly, he discovered that the greatest pathological effects occurred with expression of mutant protein in the retinal pigment epithelium layer, identifying it as the most important target layer for therapeutic correction \(2\). 

  

 Seabra and his colleagues then developed a serotype 2 adeno\-associated viral vector AAV2/2\-CBA\-REP1 for therapeutic delivery of the human transgene and showed that sub\-retinal injections of the vector to reach the retinal pigment layer improved retinal function in the mouse model \(3\). 

 A pioneering Phase 1/2 clinical trial to assess the effect of retinal gene therapy in collaboration with Prof Robert MacLaren at Oxford and Matthew During in Ohio was undertaken based on results in Seabra’s experimental system, defining the specific retinal pigment layer therapeutic target and the potential safety and efficacy of the vector \(4\). The results of the trial in 2014 indicated that after 6 months patients showed improvement in their vision in dim light and two of the six patients were able to read more lines on an eye chart.  On the basis of this, the vectors and its uses were patented with Seabra, MacLaren and During as inventors.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Choroideremia is a rare degenerative retinal disease which presents as night blindness and progressive visual field constriction from late childhood, leading to blindness in men typically in the fourth decade. Choroideremia presents in a milder form in women. It affects approximately 1 in 50,000 people. Neither specific diagnostics nor any treatment for the disease were available before the Imperial College research. 

 The preclinical work from Prof Miguel Seabra in defining the underlying biochemical mechanisms of choroideremia has had a major impact on its diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Diagnosis of the disease, which can be strikingly variable even within the same family, was based previously only on characteristic fundus findings and family history.  Diagnoses in suspected cases can now be confirmed by direct genetic testing or through immunoblot analysis with anti\-REP\-1 antibody to differentiate it from related disorders, which could have both therapeutic and prognostic relevance \[ **A**\]. 

 Seabra developed the first mouse models for the disease and discovered the cells in the retina responsible for initiating the disease. With MacLaren, he developed a therapeutic adeno\-associated virus serotype 2 \(AAV2\) treatment vector, AAV\-REP1, and showed its potential efficacy and safety with sub\-retinal injection in the mouse. This led to a first\-in\-man clinical trial that provided first evidence for clinical benefits. Based on this, a successful patent \(US20140107185A1\) for invention of gene therapy of choroideremia based on retinal gene therapy using the human *CHM* transgene and methods of preventing or treating this disease using the vector was filed with MacLaren and During \[ **B**\]. 

 With completion of the first trial and follow up of patients, Seabra, MacLaren and their colleagues were able to show the gene therapy had a profound impact on treatment for vision in some of those who received it.  Sustained visual acuity gains were seen over a period of several years in end\-stage eyes, in which rapid visual acuity loss would ordinarily be expected, with several patients experiencing gains of three lines or more, an improvement widely accepted to be clinically significant \[ **C**\].  Professor Robert MacLaren, the ophthalmologist who led the trial, said: 

 “*The early results of vision improvement we saw have been sustained for as long as we have been following up these patients and in several the gene therapy injection was over 5 years ago. The trial has made a big difference to their lives*.” \[ **D**\]. 

 The trial also led to surgical innovations in the development of an automated injection system directed by intraoperative retinal scanning using optical coherence tomography, that informed subsequent trials and whose impact has been to minimise surgical adverse events with the sub\-retinal delivery of genetic therapies \[ **C**\]. 

 The research has had substantial economic impact, in addition to that clinically. In 2014. the investigators formed a spinout company in conjunction with Isis Innovations in Oxford, NightstaRX Limited, \(subsequently renamed Nightstar Therapeutics\) in which Imperial College held an equity share. Treatment of choroideremia was the lead programme for Nightstar, which received series A, B, and C funding from Syncona Limited and other investors \[ **E**\]. 

 The leading gene therapy programme, known as NSR\-REP1, has been prosecuted in phase 1 and 2 trials, and the company started an international phase 3 study, the ‘STAR’ trial in 2018. Nightstar Therapeutics raised $75,000,000 through a NASDAQ IPO in 2017 \[ **F**\] to fund the phase 3 trial and its other programmes. Investment subsequently grew to $500,000,000 \[ **G**\]. In July 2019, Biogen acquired Nightstar for over $800,000,000 to boost its clinical ophthalmology assets, where gene therapy for choroideremia \(NSR\-REP1\) was noted as the lead asset being purchased \[ **H**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Designing out crime, sometimes referred to as Crime Prevention through Environmental Design \(CPTED\) is an approach that aims to create \(design, build and maintain\) places and spaces \(in this case the focus is housing developments\) that are less vulnerable to crime. Research at the University of Huddersfield influenced police and planning policy and practice in the UK and the United Arab Emirates. It confirmed that housing built to Secured by Design \(SBD\) standards \(based on designing out crime principles\) experienced 55% less burglary than housing that does not meet these standards. Government planning guidance was updated to include the standards at a time when austerity measures were favouring a reduction in ‘red tape’. Building regulations at the national and local level were updated to stipulate that housing must be built to these specifications. This increased the number of secure homes \(44% of new homes built between 2013 and 2017 were SBD\) and reduced crime and increased feelings of safety. Police training relies on the research findings. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Secured by Design \(SBD\), the official police security initiative, began in 1989 in the South East of England, as a response to an increase in burglary rates attributed to poor physical security and weaknesses in the design of residential housing \(thus incorporating the principles of designing out crime/CPTED\). Conceived and created by a group of police officers, it was a series of recommended design features that their experience suggested would lead to a reduction in residential crime. The scheme was considered among police to make intuitive sense, but its growth, and acceptance by key external agencies, was hampered due to a lack of independent evidence that the interventions were effective. Understanding this was of fundamental importance to planning and policing policy and practice. Once built, housing lasts for decades, and there is little that can be done to correct vulnerabilities without great expense. 

 The research underpinning this case study was carried out at the University of Huddersfield \(UoH\) by Dr Rachel Armitage \(Professor of Criminology at UoH since 1998\) and Dr Leanne Monchuk \(Senior Lecturer in Criminology and Policing at UoH since 2006\). 

 **Identification of the features of housing design that reduce vulnerability to burglary and measuring the effectiveness of SBD as a crime reduction measure** 

 Two research projects funded by West Yorkshire Police and the Home Office \[F1,2\] \(2001 and 2009\) investigated whether SBD was an effective crime reduction measure. Each focused on the extent to which the combined design requirements of the SBD scheme impacted upon i\) levels of crime, ii\) residents’ feelings of safety, and iii\) whether any benefits had been sustained over a ten\-year period. Police crime records were analysed and residents’ feelings of safety were investigated using questionnaires. The findings confirmed that i\) houses built to the SBD standard experience 55% less crime than comparators, ii\) residents living in SBD properties feel safer, iii\) the additional costs of building to this standard are recouped in crimes avoided in less than two years, and iv\) the crime reduction benefits of SBD are sustained over a ten\-year period. \[R1\] 

 Further research built on these findings between 2009 and 2020 and examined the effect of housing design on crime. Two projects, \[R2 and R3\], used different methodologies to identify the risk factors. The first \[R2\] studied the impact of 50 individual housing design features on crimes experienced at over 6,000 properties across the Greater Manchester, West Midlands and Kent police force areas. Interviews \(with planners and architects\) and site surveys enabled the research team to identify which design features enhanced or reduced crime. For example, being located on a corner plot increases crime risk by 18%, being located on a through road as opposed to a cul\-de\-sac increases crime risk by 93%. The second \[R3\] conducted in\-depth interviews with 22 incarcerated burglars to identify the design features that attracted and deterred them when selecting their burglary targets. The study confirmed the findings of \[R2\] – housing design impacts the likelihood of burglary victimisation and specific risky features should be designed out. Examples include avoiding high fences, which provide intruders with cover; avoiding footpaths that run behind properties, which can help an intruder legitimise their presence; and building true \(as opposed to leaky\) cul\-de\-sacs which force intruders to leave by the same route they entered. 

 **Assessing the extent to which consideration for crime prevention has been embedded into police and planning systems** 

 Research has been commissioned by national and international authorities \[F4, 5, 6\] to assess and improve the recognition of crime prevention within planning processes and policies. The research included a comprehensive study \[R6\] that involved assessing crime data, consulting with residents and businesses and reviewing over fifty international planning policy documents to design the Safety and Security Planning manual for Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council. 

 Research to assess the behaviour of police Designing out Crime Officers \(DOCOs\) \[F4, 5\] \(2009–18\), considered the extent to which they effectively predicted crime risk, interpreted policy and balanced contradictory planning requirements. A study for the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Home Office utilised 43 focus groups and a national survey of 257 DOCOs to assess the extent to which designing out crime/CPTED was incorporated within police and planning systems. 

 Interviews were conducted with 28 DOCOs across 18 UK police forces to explore the application and delivery of CPTED and examine the accuracy of their predictions of risky crime locations \[R4, 5\]. The findings highlighted that CPTED was applied inconsistently and called for an improvement in the design and delivery of training and continued professional development. Key areas of interest were i\) the ability to make planning decisions informed by evidence, and ii\) the extent to which police planning recommendations are proportionate to the actual risk of crime on housing developments. Consequently, in 2018, Police Crime Prevention Initiatives \(PCPI\) Ltd. commissioned UoH to conduct a national training needs analysis survey of 167 DOCOs. The findings called for the DOCO role to be professionalised through a dedicated suite of accredited qualifications.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research described in this case study has impacted **police** and **planning policy** and **practice**, **prevented residential burglary** and **reduced** the **economic** and **social costs of crime** in the UK and the United Emirates, by ensuring that new dwellings are designed using features that reduce the likelihood of crime. 

 The impacts are in three areas: 

1.  Influencing planning policy and building regulations 

1.  Helping residents reduce the likelihood of burglary 

1.  Influencing police training and delivery 

 **Influencing planning policy and building regulations** 

 The research findings \[R1\] confirmed SBD, the official police security initiative that aims to design out crime, is an effective crime prevention measure. They also played a key role in influencing UK building regulations to include SBD, or other enhanced security standards. Half a million homes \(44% of those built\) were built to the SBD standard between 2013 and 2017. Since these homes experience 55% less crime than non\-SBD, this has led to a significant reduction in crimes experienced in the UK. 

 Over the years, the future of SBD has been threatened by prevailing government policy. The 2012 Taylor Review of Housing Standards encouraged a UK government drive to reduce regulation within the planning system. In response Armitage coordinated a letter, published in The Times, \(Oct 2013\) that was signed by 69 leading national and international academics, each supporting the link between deregulation and increased future crime rates. 

 Comments in the House of Lords, debating the Anti\-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill \(Oct 2013\), \[T2\] raised and reiterated these concerns, citing UoH research. Following prolonged debate, the government announced that the proposed deregulation would not be implemented, and that building regulations in England and Wales would, in fact, include security standards for the first time. 

 The link between the research \[R1, 2\] and the introduction of the new building regulations is made clear by the PCPI Senior Technical Officer \[T3\], who noted that UoH is cited in official government planning documents: *“In both \[Approved Document Q for England and Wales\] SBD is explicitly referenced…such declarations would not be possible had it not been for the direct efforts of \[UoH\]… Without doubt, our negotiating position was stronger as a consequence of our ability to make use of \[the\]* *research findings”.* 

 Similarly the PCPI Chief Operating Officer stated: “ *The Housing Standards Review \(England\)..was particularly challenging. The government of the time had set itself a ‘Red Tape Challenge’ to reduce government regulation \[..\]; Secured by Design was caught up in the process \(all Social Housing in England at that time had to meet parts of SBD guidance\). Our advantage however was that we had access to your independent evaluation of SBD and we used it to present a compelling case \[..\]. In March 2015, the only new Building Regulation to emerge from the HSR was Part Q: Security – Dwellings. This was an unprecedented move by the government of the time…and there should be no doubt that your research formed a major part of our submission”* \[T1\]. 

 England and Wales introduced ‘security’ into building regulations in 2015 and 2018 respectively. Scottish building regulations go further, specifically referencing SBD “ *as a proven means of meeting the requirements of the regulation”*. With reference to Wales, we read: *“…once again the academic research that you* \[Armitage\] *have done \[..\] formed the basis of our report. In May 2018 Part Q: Security – Dwellings \(Wales\) was published”.* The influence on Scottish building regulations is as crucial: *“Again, the research \[..\] was a pivotal piece of the evidence considered by the Scottish Government”* \[T1\] *.* 

 The research \[R1, 2, 3\] has also influenced national and local planning policy. The existence of independent research that demonstrated the crime reduction benefits of SBD and associated design principles strengthened the case for its inclusion in planning policies and thus increased the number of homes built to this standard \[T1\]. It also influenced police crime prevention policy. The National Police Chief’s Council Lead for Crime Prevention stated: “ *Research conducted by the UoH has been influential in shaping the design of crime prevention policy and practice across the UK”* \[T4\]. 

 The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner cited UoH research in their formal response to City of Wolverhampton Council’s Area Action Plan \[T6\] stipulating that any new development must be built to the SBD standard \[R1\]. Other examples include Birmingham Council which requires all housing stock \(Birmingham Municipal Housing Trust\) to be built to the SBD standard, where it is specified in not only its ‘House Types Catalogue’ \(2018\), but also in client specifications for anyone tendering for development. Birmingham City Council’s Senior Service Manager \[T5\] confirmed the importance of UoH’s research in informing their decision to require new homes to be built to SBD standards: *“We rely on feedback from both tenants and owners, but also the role of academia, for example the research conducted by the University of Huddersfield”.* 

 The research \[R1\] has been referenced in SBD’s ‘New Homes’ standard in every iteration since 2013 as evidence of the effectiveness of the scheme. As the Senior Technical Officer for Police Crime prevention highlighted: “ *We produce a range of designing out crime guides, SBD Homes being in highest demand. We include specific reference to \[the\] 2009 SBD research…Our \[..\] 2019 guide carries an acknowledgement to Professor Armitage”* \[T3\]. 

 The reputation of the UoH team resulted in the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council funding research \[R6\] to help them introduce an integrated development process and assist with the production of its first crime prevention planning guide – the Abu Dhabi Safety and Security Planning Manual \(SSPM\). Since 2013 the SSPM has ensured that all new buildings constructed have adhered to CPTED principles. 

 **Helping residents reduce the likelihood of burglary** 

 The research \[R1, 2\] has formed the basis of resident\-focused leaflets that provide guidance on how to avoid burglary victimisation, or repeat victimisation \(for those who have been burgled\). Research conducted with West Yorkshire Police \[R3\] formed the basis of the PCPI ‘Crime Prevention Handbook’, in particular the section: ‘How do Burglars Choose a Home’? The handbook is distributed to all UK police forces. The National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for Crime Prevention \[T4\] states: “ *Your research, which has contributed to key content in the ‘Yellow Book’ – a crime prevention guide which is produced by PCPI and is currently widely distributed across the UK, shows how your contribution in this area assists me in embedding the National Crime Prevention Strategy”.* 

 The content of the Victim Support ‘How to Protect Your Property’ handbook which is given out on a daily basis to victims of burglary across the UK was informed by the research \[R3\]. The Operations Manager for Victim Support stated: “ *When it came to information for our ‘How to Protect Your Property’ leaflet, we wanted to ensure that \[it included\] information gained from research carried out with offenders”.* The UoH findings meant Victim Support were able to include direct quotes from offenders on how to mitigate risk. She added: *“The leaflet was very easy to understand, but very impactful”* \[T7\]. 

 **Influencing police training and delivery** 

 The research \[R4, 5\] influenced the development of the new Police Crime Prevention Training Academy \(2017\). The head of the Academy stated that it influenced the decision to establish the organisation, which formalised qualifications and increased police credibility within the designing out crime sector: *“DOCOs are in frequent contact with highly qualified professionals such as planners and architects. \[The\] research highlighted the need for qualifications rather than traditional police training.”* Research on training needs allowed the content of the new qualifications to be tailored and formed the basis of much of it. *“The research \[..\] was essential evidence that we used to support the material that we were teaching”* \[T8\]. 

 West Yorkshire Police used the research \[R4, 5\] to inform training packages for police \(Special Constables, PCSOs, Constables and Sergeants\) and key partners \(Fire and Rescue, Local Authority Housing Officers\). The Force Crime Prevention Officer for West Yorkshire Police stated: “ *Problem solving masterclasses alone have reached an audience of approximately 1000\-1200 Officers. Every West Yorkshire Fire & Rescue crew have also received an input on crime prevention \[..\], the foundation of which was the burglary research. This training was delivered to approximately 60 crews, equating to around 900 Officers”* \[T9\]. 

 The research \[R1, 2, 3\] directly informed the allocation of the Home Office Safer Streets Fund \(£25 million\) to police forces across England and Wales and influenced the interventions toolkit used to evaluate funding allocations. Over 90% of the successful bids opted to implement designing out crime/CPTED based interventions. As the Home Office Neighbourhood Crime Unit highlighted: “ *\[The\] research has played an invaluable role in both the development and delivery of the Safer Streets Fund…Following initial conversations at the Burglary Taskforce, Professor Armitage was invited to sit on the Safer Streets expert group which oversaw the development of a crime prevention toolkit to help provide Police and Crime Commissioners \(PCCs\) with evidence and information on effective interventions. \[The\] research heavily featured in this toolkit \[..\] this resource was well\-used by PCCs and directly supported them in the bidding process*” \[T10\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Manchester \(UoM\) has led the British Election Study \(BES\) since 2013. In so doing, it has supported the functioning of British democracy by: \(1\) improving media coverage of elections, putting academic analysis at its heart; \(2\) embedding research into political polling, thereby placing political polling on a firmer methodological footing and facilitating methodological improvements to polling; and  \(3\) shaping the behaviour of key political actors, enabling better\-informed political decisions through the provision of reliable data to the two main political parties in the UK. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\)\-funded British Election Study has been run at every British election since 1964. Its remit is twofold: first, to gather high\-quality data on British political attitudes and electoral behaviour to facilitate academic and non\-academic political research; second, to conduct and publish original research into British political attitudes and behaviour. The University of Manchester was awarded the British Election Study in 2013 \(i\) and again in 2019 \(ii\). Three research contributions underpin the impact reported in this case study: 

#  1. Collecting gold\-standard data on British voting behaviour and political attitudes 

 The 2014 \- 2020 period has been one of the most tumultuous in British history, with three general elections, two high\-stakes referendums, and many other important electoral events. The British Election Study leadership team \(2014 – 2020\) has designed, implemented, and disseminated data \[1\] consisting of: \(1\) Random probability face\-to\-face surveys covering the 2015, 2017, and 2019 elections; and \(2\) a 20\-wave internet\-panel survey – the largest of its kind ever collected in the UK – covering the 2015, 2017, and 2019 general elections, the Scottish independence referendum, the EU referendum, the 2014 and 2019 European Parliament elections, and local and devolved \(combined authority\) elections. Through a rigorous theoretical approach and careful methodological design, the BES team has delivered a uniquely valuable data resource for researchers within and beyond academia, which has been and continues to be more widely used than ever before. 

#  2. Making sense of British politics in flux 

 The general elections of 2015, 2017, and 2019 were among the most volatile in British electoral history. The Manchester BES team’s research has sought to understand why British politics and the British party system has become destabilised \[2, 3, 4\]. Key findings demonstrate how long\-term, gradual changes in voter volatility and the impact of electoral shocks have combined to radically transform the political landscape. The research shows that increased voter volatility is driven, in part, by a weakening of voters’ partisan attachments – a process known as partisan dealignment – together with the growth of smaller parties \(which has led to ‘party system fragmentation’\). 

 Partisan dealignment alone does not explain the results of recent elections. Voters might be more likely to switch parties than in the past but that does not tell us which voters are switching to which parties, and why they are doing so. The team’s findings suggest that to properly understand political change, we need to consider the electoral shocks that have acted as catalysts for large scale vote\-switching in particular directions; specifically, the Global Financial Crisis, recent immigration patterns, the Conservative\-Liberal Democrat coalition, and the Scottish independence and EU referendums. In the main book arising from the BES team’s work \[2\], this evidence is set out and a novel theoretical perspective on the study of elections and electoral behaviour is introduced. 

#  3. Diagnosing polling errors 

 While British voting behaviour was in flux, the 2015 polling miss \(in which the pre\-election polls proved inaccurate\) undermined public confidence in the accuracy of survey research. The BES team, as part of the British Polling Council inquiry into the polling miss, diagnosed the problems with the polls in 2015 and offered potential solutions to fix them \[5, 6\]. The team’s research found limited evidence of systematic voter intention misreporting, late swings, systematically different preferences among the ‘don’t knows’, and differential turnout of parties’ supporters \[5, 6\]. By comparing the BES face\-to\-face probability sample and BES Internet panel \[A\], findings demonstrate that the online survey’s polling error was primarily caused by under\-sampling non\-voters, and then weighting respondents to represent the general population. Consequently, demographic groups with a low probability of voting were overweighted within the voter subsample.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 A well\-functioning democracy requires well\-informed citizens and responsive political parties. The BES team worked to improve media coverage of elections by integrating academic analysis into ITV’s election coverage, engaging with parliamentarians and the wider media. Its input into the British Polling Council’s inquiry into the 2015 polling miss, directly contributed to changes in polling methodologies used by pollsters, and key figures from both main political parties have attested to the impact the BES research has had in supporting the health of British democracy. 

#  1. Improving media coverage of elections by putting academic analysis at its heart 

 Central to the BES team’s role in making a better informed democracy was the collaboration with ITV news, led by Green \(University of Manchester until 2018\) and Prosser. Drawing on the extensive research into British voting behaviour \[1\-4\], Green and Prosser actively shaped ITV’s coverage of the 2015, 2017, and 2019 General Elections, and the 2016 EU Referendum, by putting the research results and analysis at their heart. Traditional television coverage of elections has relied solely on analysis of aggregate level data which can lead to false inferences about the behaviour of individual voters and groups. Green and Prosser introduced a new approach, using survey data collected before and during the election campaign \[1\] to better inform ITV’s audience about voter’s opinions and motivations. Summarising what the BES teams input and data brought to ITV’s elections coverage \(which was nominated for Royal Television Society and BAFTA awards\) the ITV News Editor wrote that this  *“has been central to our election and referendum programmes and provided unique benefits to viewers \- informing them earliest of results \- and crucially, playing a fundamental role in ITV's coverage in explaining results in a clear, compelling and rigorous way and bringing clarity to the most complex issues of our time for viewers around the UK”* \[A\]. 

 The UoM team placed the BES research as a principal voice in understanding the 2015 – 2019 elections and the 2016 referendum through extensive work with a wide range of media channels – informing the public about British elections and public opinion with high\- quality survey data and analysis \[A, B, C, D\] that went beyond the headline polling numbers that dominate media coverage. The team engaged in events before and after the 2015 General Election, the 2016 EU referendum, the 2017 General Election, and the 2019 General Election \(e.g. BES journalist events, Political Studies Association media briefings, the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Social Science and Policy, three major BBC Parliament events, one\-to\-one meetings with key broadcasters\), and wrote commissioned articles for newspapers and the BBC online \(related to the research in \[2\-4\]\). According to Factiva, in the six years since the Manchester team took over the BES, there was a greater than ten\-fold increase in print media articles mentioning the BES \(2014\-2020\) compared to the previous 6 years \[B\]. 

#  2. Putting political polling on a firmer methodological footing 

 Political polling plays a central role in modern democracy by informing political actors, the media, and citizens about voters’ preferences and opinions. Just as political events cry out for reliable data and greater public understanding, polling misses have undermined public confidence in survey research. BES research led the way in diagnosing the problems with polls in 2015 and identifying methodological improvements \[5, 6\]. As the Secretary of the British Polling Council wrote: *“At a time when the whole concept of sample surveys was called into doubt, the ability of the BES to show that well\-designed and well\-conducted surveys can still represent the population with a high degree of accuracy helped polling organisations both by helping them understand what might have gone wrong and how to avoid similar problems in future”* \[C\]. 

 Drawing on the face\-to\-face survey data, research by Mellon and Prosser \[5\] was the first to suggest that unrepresentative samples were the cause of the 2015 polling miss \[D\], a conclusion later supported by the British Polling Council inquiry into the polling miss \[6\], in which Green took part, and accepted by the polling industry as a whole \[B, C\]. The Manchester team actively sought to inform the public and pollsters as to the reasons for the polling miss. Mellon and Prosser wrote a series of blog posts on the BES website and the influential Monkey Cage \( *Washington Post*\) and actively promoted their findings in the media \(BBC Newsnight, *The Guardian, The Independent*, *Huffington Post*\). They presented at industry and academic conferences, and engaged directly with the heads of research at prominent polling firms, including Pew, YouGov, ICM, TNS, and GQR. 

 The Manchester\-based research has caused leading pollsters to change their methodology. The importance of BES data in underpinning improvements to political polling is visible in its use in providing weighting targets for many polling companies \[E\]. The Head of Methods at Kantar Public wrote, *“The single most important contribution for us was the suggestion of “turnout weighting” in Mellon and Prosser’s paper “Missing Non\-Voters and Misweighted Samples: Explaining the 2015 Great British Polling Miss* \[5\] *”* \[F\]. BES data also plays a key role in new polling innovations, such as YouGov’s MRP \(Multi\-level Regression and Post\-stratification\) model which \(almost alone amongst its competitors\) accurately predicted the outcome of the 2017 election, in part by using BES data to estimate the likely turnout pattern \[G\]. The Secretary of the British Polling Council wrote *“Individual BPC members have also made extensive use of the BES in conducting their own internal investigations into how they might avoid similar polling errors in future... the BPC as an umbrella body is happy to speak for its members and say that many have found the BES very useful in their own work”* \[C\]. 

 The research and engagement undertaken by the Manchester BES team has been recognised for its role in understanding the polling miss leading to more accurate polling methods adopted by leading pollsters. The BES was a finalist for the 2017 ESRC Celebrating Impact Prize, in the Outstanding Impact in Society category \[H\]. 

#  3. Supporting the health of British democracy through reliable data 

 BES research has impacted on British democracy by providing high\-quality data \[1\] that informs the decision making of key political actors. Prosser and Mellon submitted written evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Political Polling and Digital Media, and Green gave oral evidence, and co\-authored the World Association for Public Opinion Research \(WAPOR\) submission to the same inquiry. The behaviour of the two main political parties in the UK, the Conservatives and Labour, has been shaped by their use of BES data and analysis to understand voter movements, resource allocation during campaigns, and inform post\-election analyses presented to stakeholders. 

 \[Text removed for publication\] \[I\]. 

 Likewise, the General Secretary of the Labour Party, Jennie Formby, wrote, *“Since the current BES scientific leadership group assumed management of the project, we have used BES information in planning and preparing for both the last two general elections”* \[J\] *.* Specifically, she states that the BES research *“has been used to inform Labour’s approach, strategy, and resource allocation in our campaigns… in particular, it has been used: to underpin targeting decisions, drive resource allocation, inform subsequent post\-election reviews, and enrich understanding and discussions of political attitudes, trends and patterns in British elections”* \[J\]. Summarising the importance of the BES, she wrote that the BES “ *has an impact, far beyond the university sector, in ensuring that our democracy is healthy and well\-served by political party activities which reflect the concerns and priorities of the British electorate”* \[J\]. After the 2019 election the Labour Together Review commissioners wrote that BES data, *“was incredibly helpful as our review aimed to understand Labour’s decline in support over a longer period…. Although they were hard to face, our conclusions were evidence\-based and accepted across the party. We are certain that the deep respect for the work of the British Election Study from people across Labour’s political sphere helped us to achieve this”* \[K\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Development of literacy skills in children is crucial to their life outcomes. Research on the varied cognitive processes involved in acquiring literacy has changed the teaching of literacy in two inter\-related ways. Firstly, it has influenced policy on the teaching and assessment of phonics and early reading, affecting all primary state school learners in England and across two states in Australia, and thus impacting over 4,000,000 children. Secondly it has changed literacy teaching practice in over 10 countries, affecting learners who speak English as a first language, as well as those for whom it is an additional or second language. The research has therefore made a vital contribution towards addressing low pupil attainment through improving teachers’ knowledge of the processes involved in gaining literacy. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Research at the University of Reading has shown the importance of understanding that children learn to read through a variety of cognitive processes; moreover, the efficacy of these different processes varies from child to child and between bilingual children \(for whom English is an additional language, EAL\) and monolingual children whose first language is English \[Section 3, refs 2–5\]. For this reason, if children are to receive the most appropriate materials and forms of classroom instruction, it is crucial that teachers understand these varied processes \[refs 1 and 6\]. 

##  Understanding the cognitive processes underpinning the reading and spelling of words 

 Through two ESRC\-funded experimental, longitudinal studies \(GBP306,621\), the research identified RAN \(the ability to name letters and symbols quickly and automatically\) as an additional factor in the successful development of literacy in English. Critically, it found that RAN was independent of phonological awareness \[refs 2 and 3\] \(the ability to identify the sounds in words by matching letters to sounds\). Phonological awareness is strongly linked to reading development, and previous research had suggested that it was the phonological aspect of RAN that explained its link to reading. However, the ground\-breaking work at Reading showed that, beyond phonology, there was also a role for visual factors in the link between RAN and both the reading and the spelling of words. Importantly, the research \[ref 3\] showed that RAN was linked to the storing and accessing of the written forms of words. This is crucial in English for words with unpredictable spellings \(for example, *the, what, yacht*\) \[refs 2 and 3\], where the processes that RAN draws on are vital in accessing the written forms of whole words quickly and accurately. Consequently, if teachers are to be able to develop children’s reading effectively, it is essential that they are knowledgeable about these cognitive factors. Furthermore, the research demonstrated that RAN was an independent, potentially causal factor in early abilities to read and spell words. This indicates RAN’s significant value as a screening tool, particularly for the early identification of reading problems such as dyslexia \[refs 2 and 3\]. 

##  Children with good comprehension skills learn new words through context 

 The Reading research has also shown that children differ in the extent to which they can increase their vocabulary through reading. A study using eye\-tracking explored the reading processes of 40 children \[ref 4\] and showed that children with good \(as opposed to poor\) comprehension skills could learn new words incidentally by reading texts. It was found that children used contextual information to guide their reading behaviour, thus learning about both the spelling and the meaning of new words presented to them in sentences. 

##  Bilingual children learn vocabulary through reading but face other challenges in the development of literacy 

 EAL children form around 21% of the primary school population, making it vital to understand how they develop literacy. Research carried out at Reading has identified two important aspects of such development. In a second eye\-tracking study, the project funded by the British Academy \(GBP9,967\) established that EAL children were very efficient at using context to learn new words, and that their bilingualism thus gave them an important strength. At the same time, a qualitative longitudinal study involving interviews with 10 learners, seven teachers and four parents from five schools \[ref 5\] established that learning to be literate in two languages brought with it tensions as these multilingual children tried to meet the differing expectations of family and school. 

##  Teachers need advanced knowledge for teaching literacy to different learners 

 In line with the above findings on the different cognitive processes employed by different learners, further research has informed the knowledge base on the importance of teacher understanding of such processes. This is essential, in order to deploy the most appropriate pedagogy for individual learners. University of Reading research, shared in an accessible format in 2016 showed that, in order to teach phonics successfully, teachers needed to raise their own explicit phonemic awareness \[ref 1\]; they also need to improve their knowledge of other cognitive processes involved in reading and spelling different types of words \(regular words and exceptions\) \[refs 2 and 3\]. 

 Moreover, the research \[ref 4\] also showed the importance of teachers understanding two key principles. First, that EAL learning needs are not the same as those of pupils with literacy difficulties. Second, that classroom activities should be tailored to the needs of different learners, namely by providing more independent reading experiences for EAL learners and/or providing vocabulary support to aid reading comprehension for those who need it. All of these research findings underline the importance of teacher subject knowledge. In addressing the challenges in teaching literacy to EAL children, evidence from Flynn’s 2019 article in *Teacher Development* \[ref 6\] demonstrates that classroom practice and subject knowledge can be improved through research\-informed support tools created as part of practitioner–researcher collaborations. 

 Overall, the combined work of literacy researchers based at Reading has advanced our understanding of the cognitive processes involved in learning to read and spell, both of children whose first language is English and of EAL children, as well as among those potentially at risk of failing to learn to read. Knowledge of the implications that these processes have for learning to read and spell words is often lacking among teachers, yet an understanding of them can help teachers to become more effective in deploying the most appropriate classroom strategies. On the basis of this research, revised education policy and teaching strategies have been implemented globally, and materials for literacy have been widely revised too.

#  3. References to the research 

 **2\* threshold:** The research constitutes a cohesive body of work that is unique in its combined focus on the cognitive processes underpinning the development of literacy among monolingual and bilingual learners and the crucial role of teachers’ subject knowledge in teaching literacy to both groups. Through longitudinal and cross\-sectional experimental studies applying novel research methods such as eye\-tracking, as well as those using longitudinal, qualitative techniques of investigation or analysis, it has contributed significantly to the advancement of knowledge and, in turn, to changes in policy and practice. The research has spanned a period of significant shift in policy on the teaching of English. All of the above is reflected in the work’s funding through competitive, peer\-reviewed grants, and publication in peer\-reviewed international journals.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Changing teachers’ practice in order to improve pupil outcomes in literacy is of vital importance because literacy is the gateway to economic and social success. Through their research insights into the cognitive processes that underpin literacy, and the teaching strategies that can improve learning for EAL children, researchers at Reading have influenced and changed teaching practice and education policy on literacy in England and Australia. Their research has led to the development of important tools for assessing progress in early reading in all state primary schools in England \(impacting the practice of around 30,000 teachers of around 500,000 six\-year\-olds each year\) and two states in Australia impacting around 8,000 teachers each year in 500 schools. It has also been used to train and improve the classroom practice of nearly 7,000 practising teachers in England and a further 1,800 in Malaysia and New Zealand, as well as influence materials and practices for teaching bilingual learners, across at least 10 countries. 

##  Changes to national and international policy on the teaching and assessment of literacy 

 Research carried out at Reading established the important role played by teachers’ own phonological knowledge in classroom practice \[ref 1\]. The findings of that research, published as a teacher guide, have become enshrined in the OFSTED \(2019\) framework for the inspection of early reading in primary schools in England and Wales \[Section 5, source1\], which requires that teacher subject knowledge for teaching reading is explicitly commented on by school inspectors. The research also underpins the guidance for teachers of 7–11\-year\-olds in the UK published by The Education Endowment Foundation \[source 1\]. 

 Based on its expertise in phonics research, the University of Reading was commissioned to work with the Department for Education \(DfE, England\) in developing the year 1 Phonics Screening Check \(PSC; 2012\). This is a national assessment tool used to benchmark reading skills in all schools providing teaching at key stage \(KS\) 1. Subsequently, in 2013 and 2016, researchers at Reading were asked by the DfE to provide test items for further versions of the PSC. The implementation of the PSC had an important impact on classroom practice, because it “led to schools making changes to their phonics teaching”, prompted teachers to “review or revise phonics teaching plans in general”, and to use “evidence from the check to make decisions about extra support for individuals” \[source 2\]. The use of the PSC in England has been associated with a rise in reading performance. In 2019, 82% of year 1 pupils achieved the benchmark standard compared with 58% in 2012 when the PSC was first introduced. Moreover, the PSC’s introduction is correlated with raised literacy attainment at the end of KS2 \[source 2\]. Therefore, literacy research at Reading has had a direct and sustained impact on raising national standards in literacy for 6 and 11\-year\-olds in England, because the PSC has improved teachers’ understanding of the crucial role of developing strong phonic knowledge during KS1. 

 The reach of the PSC has since extended into the international context. It has informed policy and practice for the assessment of early reading in South Australia, where it is used in all state primary schools, and was introduced state\-wide in New South Wales in 2020. The research from Reading has been used “to inform educators and policymakers … and therefore improve literacy levels among children” \[source 2\]. In New Zealand, a new series of classroom books \(funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Education\) is being developed using Reading’s “research on the predictors of irregular word reading” which “is influencing the way materials are being developed and the guidance given to teachers”. This is a significant shift in policy on the use of phonics\-based methods in reading programmes across New Zealand and is aimed at improving the literacy outcomes of pupils at risk from reading failure \[source 2\]. 

##  Impact on training and practice in the teaching and assessment of literacy 

 As a result of their research demonstrating the need to understand cognitive processes which underpin learning to read \[see refs 1, 2, 3 and 6\], further funding from the DfE was won to deliver phonics training for parts of England where pupil progress in reading was below the national average. These events, known as “The Phonics Roadshows”, were attended by over 600 teachers in 2017, from 14 designated Opportunity Areas, covering five of the nine England governmental regions. In a one\-year\-on follow\-up survey to the roadshows, 70% of teachers had actively implemented changes in their practices \[source 3\]. Moreover, impact at a regional level, affecting around 439,000 children, was recorded in interviews with nine local authority phonics leads \(in south\-east and south\-west England, East Anglia and the Midlands\), noting that “as a result of \[this\] work we have given a high priority to the leadership of phonics in the local authority. This has already impacted on the quality of Continuing Professional Development offered” \[source 3\]. 

 The research carried out at Reading has also underpinned the GL Diagnostic Test of Word Reading Processes \(DTWRP\), an aid to improve teaching practice. The tool, used in around 170 primary schools across the UK since 2014, includes explicit guidance on targeted research\-informed interventions for specific literacy difficulties, providing invaluable training for classroom practitioners \[source 4\]. Similarly, research from Reading on RAN and phonological awareness has been used by others providing training for practitioners working in the area of specific learning difficulties \[ref 3\]. For example, a provider of continuing professional development \(CPD\) has used it in her training of teachers working with over 16,500 learners in England, thus enabling them to support children with difficulties such as Dyslexia \[source 5\]. Extending the reach, researchers from Reading delivered invited practitioner workshops in Malaysia \(2016–18\). These included teachers, specialist regional literacy support staff, Ministry of Education staff and speech and language therapists. Attendees reported improved knowledge of literacy development from sessions that “shared valuable information to take away and put into practice” \[source 6\]. 

 The Reading research has also underpinned Initial Teacher Education \(ITE\) with the inclusion of the team’s publications \[refs 1–6\] in ITE syllabi at universities across England, including University College London, York, Leicester and Newcastle. It has also influenced ITE internationally: in 2018, researchers from Reading delivered three practitioner workshops in Malaysia, attended by teacher educators and trainee teachers from the Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Seremban and Negeri Sembilan areas. Event feedback indicates improved understanding of the processes underpinning reading and how to adapt classroom practice accordingly \[source 6\]. 

##  Impact on training and practice in literacy instruction for bilingual learners internationally 

 The team’s combined research insights into the role of phonics and the teaching of pupils with EAL \[refs 2, 3, 5, and 6\] led to an invitation from Oxford University Press to write guidelines for the creators of phonics programmes used in English as a foreign language \(EFL\) contexts. These have been used by editors at the Press to ensure that EFL materials are planned and written in accordance with the findings established by the literacy researchers at Reading, thereby influencing teaching and learning in China, Japan, Taiwan, Spain, Italy, Turkey and Egypt, among other countries \[source 7\]. 

 Drawing on their finding \[refs 4 and 6\] that teacher understanding of the specific needs of EAL learners is critical but under\-developed, the team has worked with practitioners to provide much\-needed CPD. Currently, there is no UK national policy to support the teaching of EAL learners. To address this gap, they developed an online tool, now used in the UK and 48 other countries, that was collaboratively constructed with teachers and Local Authority EAL experts \[ref 6\]. The tool includes case studies which provide evidence of change, based on teachers' reports of improved pupil literacy outcomes resulting from the evidence\-informed practice. Though aimed mainly at teachers in the UK, it also used by EFL teachers abroad; for example, by those in Ecuador \[source 8\]. 

 Furthermore, the research team has also engaged with and changed teaching practice in schools with a high proportion of EAL learners in Oxfordshire, Hampshire and the North West. One Headteacher notes that “\[Reading’s\] research on children with specific comprehension difficulties means that we are better placed to identify these children and support them appropriately” \[source 9\]. The team also provided training to all staff in a school where 98% of learners had English as an additional language. This has enhanced the practice of 20 teachers and raised overall learning outcomes for its 360 pupils \[source 9\]. Regionally, the research has been used within the CPD offer of local authorities in Berkshire, Hampshire and Portsmouth, and by a training hub for schools in the north\-west. In Hampshire, the long\-term partnership with the University of Reading means that the research has had “far\-reaching impact” on an annual average of over 700 EAL learners across 479 schools \[source 9\]. In May 2020 the research supported webinars hosted by The Bell Foundation \(around 600 teachers registered\). Described by Bell as “the most popular webinar we have broadcast”, the event offered guidance for teachers on the home\-schooling of EAL learners during the COVID\-19 pandemic. 

 In summary, failure to gain literacy skills in childhood leads to a poorer quality of life in adulthood. To address this, the research has demonstrated the necessity for appropriate instruction, tailored towards individual needs and based on strong teacher understanding of the cognitive processes that underlie the development of literacy among both monolingual and bilingual students. The research and engagement practices of the team have filled gaps in education policy and practice. Through the provision of research\-informed tools and continuing professional development across 10 countries, teachers of literacy are now better equipped for significantly improving the life chances of millions of children.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Through 2 clinical trials in locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer \(LAMPC\), we have transformed the therapeutic approaches in the management of this disease which previously had extremely poor prognosis. Specifically: 

1.  **Outcomes for patients with LAMPC have improved**; most importantly life expectancy has increased by 1.6 years, 3\-year survival rate has increased and skeletal\-related complications have decreased; 

1.  **Global guidelines for the treatment of LAMPC have changed**; and 

1.  **Clinical care practices have changed including new standards of care and new cost\-effective treatment options**.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, where it accounts for 25% of newly diagnosed cancers, and is the second most common cause of cancer death. The disease is also a major problem worldwide, being the second most common cancer in men and the sixth leading cause of cancer death, with 1.28 million new cases diagnosed in 2018. This number is expected to rise to 2.3 million by 2040 with annual deaths expected to increase from 359,000 to 740,000. Around 50% of patients are predicted to suffer locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer \(LAMPC\), of which less than half are expected to survive beyond 5 years. Professor James at the University of Birmingham \(UoB\) has been at the forefront of developing clinical trials to evaluate new therapeutic options in LAMPC which can present either at first diagnosis or at disease progression. Often the tumour becomes insensitive to the hormone \(androgen\) deprivation therapy \(ADT\) given as standard of care \(hormone refractory prostate cancer \(HRPC\)\). Beginning in 2005, James led the **TRAPEZE** and **STAMPEDE** trials to test alternative treatment options for **metastatic HRPC** and **LAMPC presenting before ADT** respectively. 

 <ins> **TRAPEZE trial generating evidence for new second\-line therapies</ins> <ins>in metastatic HRPC**</ins> 

 James and Billingham, at the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit \(CRCTU\) at the University of Birmingham, initiated, designed and conducted the large, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 **TRAPEZE trial** \(<ins>T</ins>axane, <ins>RA</ins>dioisoto<ins>PE</ins>, <ins>Z</ins>ol<ins>E</ins>dronic acid\) in **metastatic HRPC** comparing treatment with **docetaxel** alone as standard of care against 3 experimental treatment arms that included the addition of either the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid \( **ZA**\) or the radioisotope strontium\-89 \( **S89**\) or both. The trial began in 2005, randomised 757 patients and was published in 2016 \[R1\]. Its key finding \(KF\) was: 

-  **KF1:** ZA can be safely and effectively combined with docetaxel for treatment of HRPC and significantly improves patient quality of life by increasing the time before a skeletal\-related event \(SRE\) \(i.e., a pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, necessity for radiation to bone \(for pain or impending fracture\) or surgery to bone\) from 11.2 to 13.6 months and reducing the number of severe SREs by over half \(52%\) \[R1\]. 

 TRAPEZE also showed that ZA combined with docetaxel to treat HRPC is cost\-effective \[R2\]. 

 <ins> **STAMPEDE trial generating evidence for new drugs to treat LAMPC**</ins> 

 James, as Chief Investigator, in collaboration with the MRC Clinical Trials Unit \(MRCCTU\) at University College London, devised the **STAMPEDE trial** \(<ins>S</ins>ystemic <ins>T</ins>herapy in <ins>A</ins>dvancing or <ins>M</ins>etastatic <ins>P</ins>rostate cancer: <ins>E</ins>valuation of <ins>D</ins>rug <ins>E</ins>fficacy\), which launched in October 2005 as an international trial and is ongoing. The trial represents a novel and paradigm\-changing approach to trial design \[R3\]. It is a multi\-arm multi\-stage \(MAMS\) phase II/III platform clinical trial originally including a single control arm of androgen deprivation therapy \( **ADT**\) alone as standard of care **and** 5 experimental treatment arms that involved the addition of **docetaxel**, **ZA** and **celecoxib** alone or in combination. The options with or without **radiotherapy** were also assessed. The model was subsequently expanded to include a further 6 experimental treatment arms, one of these being **abiraterone** in 2011 and another, a more focussed study into radiotherapy in metastatic disease, in 2012. Results from the trial so far have concluded that celecoxib and ZA are not effective drugs in this disease setting \[R4\] but the study made the following significant findings: 

-  **KF2:** Prostate radiotherapy significantly increases 3\-year overall survival for patients with low metastatic burden prostate cancer by 8% \(from 73% to 81%\) \[R5\]. 

-  **KF3:** Addition of docetaxel to ADT significantly increases median overall survival time for patients with LAMPC by 10 months \(from 71 to 81 months\), increases mean time to first skeletal\-related event by 6.6 months \(from 61.4 to 68.0 months\) and is cost\-effective \[R4\]. 

-  **KF4:** Addition of Abiraterone to ADT significantly increases 3\-year overall survival for patients with LAMPC by 7% \(from 76% to 83%\) and increases rate of 3 years without symptomatic skeletal complications by 10% \(from 78% to 88%\) \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

1.  <ins> **Improved outcomes for patients with LAMPC**</ins> 

 Survival and quality of life of sufferers have been transformed. In particular, for UK men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, analysis of Hospital Episode Statistics \(HES\) data \[S1\] shows: 

-  **Life expectancy has increased by 1.6 years**: median 50% survival is now 39 months compared to 20 months before the trial results were published \[S1i\]; 

-  **3\-year survival has increased** from 34% to 52% such that *c*.700 more of the *c*.3800 men diagnosed each year can now expect to live for at least 3 years \[S1i\]; 

-  **Skeletal related complications within 1 year of treatment have decreased by over 23%** such that *c*.200 more of the *c*.3800 men diagnosed each year can now expect to live without suffering the physical challenges of SREs in the first year of treatment \[S1ii\]. 

 Patients have been made aware of the new improved treatment options indicated by our research through their promotion by the websites and literature of the major cancer charities \(e.g. Prostate Cancer UK and Cancer Research UK\), the Institute of Cancer Research and the STAMPEDE trial \[S2\]. As a result, patients are better able to discuss their treatment options with their doctor and are reassured that further options exist if their first or current treatment does not work for them. In addition, through these sites patients have access to the discussions around the licencing of the medications and are informed how they might access those options which are off\-label or that are not standard of care. Furthermore, the united campaigning by patients and charities speeded uptake of treatments into guidelines \[S2\]. 

1.  <ins> **Clinical guidelines have changed worldwide for the treatment of LAMPC**</ins> 

 **All major guideline bodies in oncology and urology** in the **UK** \(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) \(2019\) \[S3i–ii\]\), **Europe** \(European Society of Medical Oncologists \(ESMO\) \(2020\) \[S3iii\] and European Association of Urology \(EAU\) \(2020\) \[S3iv\]\), **America** \(American Urological Association \(AUA\) \(2020\) \[S3v\] and American Society of Clinical Oncology \(ASCO\) \(2018\) \[S3vi\]\) and **Scotland** \(Scottish Medicines Consortium \(SMC\) \(2020\) \[S3vii\]\) have **changed their guidance** on the use of **docetaxel, ZA, ADT, radiotherapy and abiraterone** to treat LAMPC as a result of the 4 new combination therapies our trial findings had indicated: 

1.  Docetaxel alone changed to docetaxel \+ ZA \[KF1\]; 

1.  ADT alone changed to ADT \+ radiotherapy \[KF2\]; 

1.  ADT alone changed to ADT \+ docetaxel \[KF3\]; 

1.  ADT alone changed to ADT \+ abiraterone \+ steroids \[KF4\]. 

 The 51 member countries of the EAU and 43 member countries of the ESMO, which include non\-EU countries, also endorse their guidelines as national guidance. In the UK, 85% of Oncologists and Urologists consider the EU as well as NICE guidelines in their practice \[S4\]. 

 Specifically: 

-  **UK \(NICE**\) recommends considering giving “ **ZA as well as docetaxel** to people with metastatic HRPC to prevent or reduce skeletal\-related events” \[S3i–ii; KF1\]. 

-  **European** \[S3\(iii, iv\)\] and **American** \[S3\(v\)\] guidelines recommend that for patients with low\-volume metastatic disease, **radiotherapy of the prostate should be considered** \[KF2\]. 

-  **UK \(NICE\)** \[S3i\], **European** \[S3iii, iv\] **and American** \[S3v, vi\] guidelines recommend clinicians **offer ADT standard therapy combined with docetaxel** to men presenting with metastases at first presentation provided they are fit enough \[KF3\]. **NICE** also extended this recommendation to high\-risk, non\-metastatic \(locally advanced\) prostate cancer patients in line with KF3 \[S3i\]. 

-  **European** \[S3iii, iv\] **and American** \[S3v, vi\] **guidelines** recommend **upfront abiraterone acetate with prednisone combined with ADT** as an alternative standard of care therapy to docetaxel combined with ADT for men presenting with metastases at first presentation provided they are fit enough \[KF4\]. **Scottish** guidelines also changed in 2020 to extend their recommendation of **abiraterone** with prednisone or prednisolone together with ADT to all newly diagnosed high\-risk metastatic hormone\-sensitive prostate cancer patients, not only those with contraindication to the standard of care therapy, docetaxel \[S3vii; KF4\]. This guidance came in response to pressure from the Health Improvement Scotland Medicines Team \(HIS\) which considered it unethical not to offer abiraterone to all patients diagnosed with high\-risk metastatic hormone\-sensitive prostate cancer \[S3viii\] given the robust evidence \(including KF4\) in support of its off\-label use as a first\-line treatment for prostate cancer, and the regular requests made by clinicians to give it through the unlicensed medicines process. A similar decision by NICE is expected in 2021. 

-  During the COVID\-19 pandemic, the **British Association of Urological Surgeons** released urgent new guidance on the combinations of drugs to use for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer, advising clinicians to consider giving abiraterone plus steroids with ADT instead of docetaxel with ADT for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic disease, who are intolerant of enzalutamide \[S3ix; KF4\]. This advice was given due to concern that immunosuppressive chemotherapy \(docetaxel\) would increase the risk of poor prognosis from infection with COVID\-19. 

 As testified by a member of the European Urology Guideline panel, the ability of STAMPEDE to “inform all major guidelines in prostate cancer after a thorough review process” is a result of its “landmark trial design \(MAMS\)” through which it “addressed several questions in an efficient manner” \[S5i\]. In just 13 years, STAMPEDE has tested 8 treatments in LAMPC and involved *c*.10,000 patients. The Senior Policy officer of Prostate Cancer UK has further identified that “The unique multi\-stage, multi\-arm approach of STAMPEDE has enabled meta\-analyses to be carried out to \[...\] fast\-track treatments to men.” He says that “we now wait with anticipation for results from subsequent arms of the trial, with complete belief that they will drive improvements in the treatment and care of men with metastatic prostate cancer” \[S5ii\]. STAMPEDE was awarded the International David Sackett Trial of the Year award by the Society for Clinical Trials in 2017, which is awarded to studies which demonstrate “methodological excellence, intellectual soundness and believed ability to provide substantial, beneficial change in healthcare” \[S6\]. 

1.  <ins> **Care practices for men with LAMPC have changed**</ins> 

 Clinical practitioners have changed the treatments they give to men with advanced prostate cancer in line with the findings of the STAMPEDE and TRAPEZE trials \[KF1–KF4\]. Specifically, 

  -  **In January 2016, Docetaxel with ADT became standard of care in the UK** for all men newly diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer immediately following publication of R4. As a result, use of docetaxel increased 2.4 fold from 14% of patients diagnosed in April–June 2015 to 34% of patients diagnosed in July–September 2016 as demonstrated in HES data \[S1iii\]. This change in clinical practice to use docetaxel off\-label in these patients \(i.e, beyond the drug’s licenced purpose\), and before changes to NICE guidelines, was actioned by release of an NHS policy statement \(January 2016\) that was issued following an evidence review by NHS England of 3 major trials \(including R4\) that found that ADT \+ docetaxel therapy would provide “an overall survival benefit of up to 15 months for patients when compared to current practice” \[S7\] — a change which Prostate cancer UK has called an “unparalleled survival benefit from a readily available generic treatment” \[S5ii\]. 

  -  **Abiraterone was adopted rapidly into practice** following publication of R6 in 2017 evidenced by a **40% \($1 billion\) rise in Johnson and Johnson’s sales** of Zytiga® \(abiraterone\) in the following year \[S8\]. Although this change was partly informed by the results of a second trial \(LATTITUDE\) that also confirmed first\-line abiraterone plus ADT for high\-risk hormone\-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer patients and was published at the same time as STAMPEDE, only STAMPEDE confirmed abiraterone for locally advanced non\-metastatic patients and was therefore foundational to this change. 

  

 The impact of our research on care practices for LAMPC patients in the UK is further attested to by a survey of Urologists and Oncologists involved with the care of these patients \[S4\], which found all participants were aware of the STAMPEDE trial and because of it: 

-  92% give radiotherapy to patients with low metastatic burden disease \[R5; KF2\]; 

-  94% give docetaxel to patients with LAMPC who are starting first\-line ADT \[R4; KF3\]; 

-  60% give abiraterone to patients with LAMPC who are starting first\-line ADT \[R6; KF4\]; 

 All participants believed the STAMPEDE trial has had global impact in the management of prostate cancer. 

 Leading international clinicians in uro\-oncology, including a member of the European Urology Guidelines Committee \[S5i\] and the lead clinician of the Urology Tumour Collaborative \[S5iii\], have testified to the **major influence of our research on care practices for LAMPC worldwide** describing TRAPEZE and STAMPEDE as “game changers in prostate cancer management” \[S5i\] with STAMPEDE being “one of the most important and influential uro\-oncology trials of all time” \[S5iii\]. They confirm that “it is now a norm in clinics world\-wide \[to use\] ZA in combination with docetaxel” \[S5iii; KF1\] and acknowledge that “moving to a new ‘standard of care’ has been provided by STAMPEDE” such that clinicians “are now confident in treating patients with locally advanced high risk prostate cancer with docetaxel as first\-line therapy” \[S5iii; KF3\]. This is in contrast to the early 2000s when clinicians would use chemotherapy \(docetaxel\) only as a “last\-ditch therapy” in metastatic HRPC \[S5iii\]. They also identify that the “STAMPEDE trial demonstrated that prostate cancer is one of the only malignancies where radiotherapy to the primary in presence of low burden metastatic disease improves outcomes” \[S5iii; KF2\] and say “combining abiraterone to hormone therapy in locally advanced disease” \[S5i; KF4\], “including the recent addition \[of this therapy\] in hormone sensitive high risk non\-metastatic prostate cancer, has also changed practice” \[S5iii; KF4\]. 

 Considerable **health economic benefits** have also come from these changes to clinical practice in prostate cancer care. HES data suggest that through the changes to treatment informed largely by our trials, SREs in the first year of diagnosis have been reduced by *c*.200 per year \[S1ii, S4\]. SREs are a particularly significant burden on healthcare spending: for example, in the UK, unit costs of surgical procedures to address skeletal\-related problems range £3,888 \(pathological fractures with complications\) to £9,573 \(decompression for spinal cord compression\) \[S9i\] and a study in the US found that SREs increase average treatment costs for men over age 66 years with metastatic prostate cancer by *c*.US$30,000 \[S9ii\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research led by Leeds Beckett University \(LBU\) has elicited changes in the education policies, practices and provisions of international anti\-doping organisations \(e.g., World Anti\-Doping Agency, Anti\-Doping Norway, Doping Authority Netherlands, UK Anti\-Doping Agency\), international and national sports federations \(e.g., World Rugby, Rugby Football Union\) and international organisations \(e.g., United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and International Olympic Committee\). LBU’s multi\-stakeholder programme of research has shifted the focus of the anti\-doping system from individual athlete culpability and the ‘fix the bad apple’ narrative to promoting strategies that concurrently address individual, social and environmental factors to prevent doping in sport. Collectively, these research impacts benefit thousands of athletes and their support personnel worldwide. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Doping remains a significant threat to the integrity of sport and poses a risk to public health. Research led by Professor Susan **Backhouse** at LBU since 2005 has drawn upon the psychosocial, contextual and behavioural factors of doping to shift policies and practices upstream to address the complex and dynamic nature of doping. In doing so, this research has brought into sharp focus the limitations of current detection\-deterrence approaches that concentrate on individual athlete culpability. By conducting research that seeks to identify, describe and interpret the social structures and processes that encourage and sustain doping behaviour, LBU research has evidenced \(1\) athlete doping vulnerability and the need to take action on the dopogenic environment and \(2\) the inherent challenges of reporting doping. 

 **Evidencing athlete doping vulnerability and the need to take\-action on the dopogenic environment.** 

 LBU research has demonstrated that doping in sport cannot be prevented by solely focussing on the individual athlete. Instead, LBU research underscores the need to address the opportunities and conditions that promote anti\-doping rule violations \(ADRVs\) – or as we termed it in a British Journal of Sports Medicine Editorial, the *dopogenic* environment. Acting as salient influencers, we found that coaches and parents can guard against the dopogenic environment, but they can also create the dopogenic conditions that give rise to athlete vulnerability **\[1, 2, 3, 4\].** For example, through in\-depth qualitative interviews, we have highlighted that parents and coaches send strong signals to their athletes; shaping their \(anti\)\-doping behaviours and approach to sport throughout their athletic career **\[1, 2, 4\].** While coach and parental influence is regularly asserted and supported by anecdotal accounts, we have provided the empirical evidence in support of these claims. Indeed, the strength of their influence, combined with their limited knowledge of anti\-doping rules and regulations, justifies targeted and tailored anti\-doping education for parents and coaches as a foundation for global preventive efforts. 

 Extending our understanding of athlete vulnerability, LBU provided the first empirical evidence of food supplement use as a potential gateway for doping in sport **\[3\]**. Specifically, food supplement users had a more positive attitude toward doping and expressed a greater belief that doping is effective. When presented with scenarios that prohibited substances are effective and increase winning, food supplement users were more in favour of competing in situations that allow doping. Following on from this study, and in partnership with one of sports largest national governing bodies – the Rugby Football Union – LBU researchers went on to address the absence of evidence on the factors that influence players’ decision\-making in terms of their diet, training and rugby lifestyles. This unique three\-year multi\-method programme of research captured the thoughts, feelings and behaviours of over 800 schoolboys, teachers and coaches through a comprehensive survey, in\-depth focus groups and interviews. The partnership gave the research team unparalleled access to school age players and coaches to better understand the pressures of the school\-rugby environment. The results showed a variety of challenges facing young players, which previously had been unknown or only estimated from anecdotal evidence. Therefore, the research has been critical to evolving understanding of the context of adolescent rugby and the motivations that may drive intentional and inadvertent doping **\[4\]**, highlighting the need for more tailored education provisions for young players and coaches. 

 **Evidencing the inherent challenges of reporting on doping in sport** 

 Athletes and support personnel are increasingly encouraged to ‘blow the whistle’ on doping in sport and the introduction of ‘report doping in sport’ hotlines highlight the growing emphasis on intelligence\-led approaches to anti\-doping. Yet, there is a limited understanding of the doping whistleblower experience. Beginning in 2014, in\-depth qualitative research conducted by LBU researchers with athletes and real\-life doping whistleblowers has provided the only sport\-specific empirical evidence to guide global whistleblowing policy and practice to deter and prevent doping in sport **\[5 & 6\]**. LBU research has highlighted the concern for self, relationships, reputation, and not knowing how to whistleblow as representing significant barriers to whistleblowing on doping in sport. LBU findings also highlight contextual differences across individual and team sports. Specifically, track and field athletes would adopt the role of a whistle‐blower and report individuals who were doping in their sport. In comparison, rugby league players highlighted a moral dilemma; despite disagreeing with their teammates' actions, the players would adhere to a code of silence and refrain from reporting doping **\[4\]**. 

 In 2017 the World Anti\-Doping Agency commissioned LBU researchers to conduct a comprehensive programme of research on reporting doping in sport. One of the research outputs generated was a creative non\-fiction story depicting the unique experiences of doping whistleblowers’ **\[6\]**. Taken together, this body of evidence illuminates the complex process that whistleblowers navigate, including the intensely emotional experience triggered by this courageous act. As such, LBU’s research contributes important findings regarding an understudied mechanism to protect the integrity of sport and the welfare of athletes. These findings prompted action on the part of the global sporting system and its stakeholders. In particular, it demonstrated a need to establish an open culture in sport, where people feel able to speak up and have confidence their concerns will be listed to – and acted upon. Further, the research underscores the need to develop skills to speak up and increase awareness of reporting channels to enable collective action to protect sporting integrity and athlete welfare.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 LBU research conducted since 2013 has changed the education policies, strategies and provisions of the global anti\-doping community, as corroborated by globally powerful sporting bodies, including the World Anti\-Doping Agency \(WADA\), World Rugby, International Olympic Committee, Doping Authority Netherlands, Anti\-Doping Norway, Sport Ireland and UK Anti\-Doping. Collectively, these policies, practices and provisions impact thousands of athletes and their support personnel globally. LBU pathways to impact have been extensive and include global expert advisory roles, targeted knowledge exchange, and collaborative partnerships with research beneficiaries. 

 **Changing the lens through which global anti\-doping organisations view the problem of doping in sport** 

 The World Anti\-Doping Agency – the global body responsible for anti\-doping policies, procedures and practices across all countries in the world \- has confirmed that research conducted by LBU has “ *provided an evidence base for WADA to promote a shift in global anti\-doping policy and to redress this balance to a more effective preventative approach to anti\-doping*” **\[A\]**. This shift is evidenced by other international anti\-doping organisations. For example, the Education Manager of Sport Ireland corroborates “ *the research conducted by LBU has directly impacted how Sport Ireland deliver anti\-doping education. We now focus on enabling clean sport behaviours by equipping athletes with the knowledge, skills and opportunities to compete clean and understand where to go for help and assistance. Sport Ireland now targets athlete support personnel and parents with anti\-doping education to ensure that there is consistent messaging and information”* **\[B\]** *.* Also drawing upon LBU research highlighting athlete vulnerability and the conditions and opportunities that promote anti\-doping rule violations, the Director of Prevention and Public Health at Anti\-Doping Norway confirms *“your concepts of a dopogenic environment, risk factors and protective factors etc. have helped form our programs and tools offered to sport clubs, sport federations, fitness centers, schools, and of course our community based approach to anti\-doping through our program ‘Local Mobilization Against Doping’, with a total reach of 25,000\-30,000 people each year” * **\[C\]**. The impact of LBU’s research was also highlighted by the Director of Prevention at Doping Authority Netherlands who confirmed it had an effect on *“looking at doping as a systemic problem, the decision to have a clean sport curriculum for parents in 2018, our input for discussions we have around whistleblowing in our Education session, Gold, and our current supplement policy’  \[D\]** *.* Like in Norway, this is significant impact considering Doping Authority Netherland’s clean sport curricula target approximately 20,000 athletes \(from youth to elite\) and their support personnel \(including parents\) **\[D\]**. Further, LBU’s research led to the development of their *Support Clean Sport Be Proud Education* \( [www.beproud.education](http://www.beproud.education/)\) programme \(partnered with 36 elite sport organisations in the Netherlands\). 

 **Directing international parent and coach education provision** 

 Illuminating LBU’s impact on international education provision, WADA confirm that LBU research has “ *been used by our education team to inform our global programmes. For example, research pointing to the important role of parents in doping prevention* **\[1\]** *has informed a new education tool \(Parents’ Guide to Support Clean Sport\) published in 2017* **\[A\]** *.* LBU’s underpinning research was cited by WADA on their website when they launched the Parents’ Guide to the global anti\-doping community **\[E\]**. Consequently, LBU research has led to multiple national anti\-doping organisations and international federations sharing this guide \(e.g., Drug Free Sport New Zealand, South Africa Institute for Drug Free Sport\) and providing parent education resources in their programmes \(e.g., Doping Authority Netherlands, in 2018 **\[D\]**\). 

 At World Rugby, even though parents are outside the direct scope of their policy, LBU’s research findings compelled the education team to act and parents are now included as a specific user\-type in their e\-learning programme, released in 2020. By including parents, World Rugby are seeking to ensure the reach of their education provision extends beyond the elite level **\[F\]**. In addition to the impact on parent education provision, LBU’s research encouraged World Rugby to *“re\-evaluate the focus given to coach education given the evidence provided indicating that an athlete’s personal decision making is influenced by coaches who become increasingly important as an athlete progresses in their career”.* This has led to more resources being provided for this group as part of World Rugby’s standard provision **\[F\]**. 

 In 2017, LBU’s ongoing research with athlete support personnel led to **Backhouse** convening and Chairing the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences Clean Sport Interest Group. This led to the establishment of UK Anti\-Doping’s \(UKAD\) Annual Clean Sport at the Front\-Line event, bringing together over 100 athlete support personnel. The benefits for UKAD are already being realised as Trevor Pearce, Chair of UK Anti\-Doping's Board, states: *“these groups have been ‘hard to reach’ for UKAD but this conference continues to go from strength to strength to ensure that those in athlete support personnel roles are well equipped with the latest anti\-doping knowledge and research”* **\[I\]** *.* 

 **Prioritising food supplement education at World Rugby and the Rugby Football Union ** 

 World Rugby corroborate that LBU’s research, conducted in partnership with the Rugby Football Union \(RFU\) has *“directly influenced our approach to supplement education and has raised our awareness about the importance of this area in rugby and have significantly increased our provision of supplement education including the publishing of two new multi\-language information films for participants on supplements, and a ‘spot the warning signs’ supplement label test on our new e\-learning site”* **\[F\]**. Further, LBU research has significantly influenced how World Rugby approach their preventative work, leading to them offering tips on healthy nutrition and conditioning as part of their new anti\-doping e\-learning education module, released in 2020. This education module has international reach as it has been produced in 12 languages **\[F\]** *.* Owing to the breadth and depth of LBU’s programme of research, its findings have directly impacted numerous policies, operations and processes at World Rugby. Subsequently, LBU research has directly informed World Rugby’s Education Policy **\[F\]** that governs all 102 Member Unions. 

 LBU’s research with the RFU – which focused on food supplement use \- led to the organisation developing a strategy for anti\-doping in the community game **\[G\]**. This strategy was the first of its kind. The manager of the RFU’s anti\-doping and illicit drugs programme, said: *“The latest findings from our joint research project with LBU shows a lack of awareness in age\-grade players, particularly around the use of supplements and therefore raising the risk of vulnerability to doping. This, and wider concerns about low awareness around doping and its impact, led us to develop a strategy for anti\-doping in the community game. It will see us increase our focus on improving awareness, enhancing education and increasing testing within the community game”* **\[G\]**. In the RFU’s 2017\-18 Annual Report they confirmed an increase in the budget for anti\-doping education in the community game to increase support for community players around a healthy lifestyle and optimal diet, in order to decrease the potential risk factors for doping. As an example of direct action taken from the research, the Food for Rugby website \(https://www.englandrugby.com/participation/playing/food\-for\-rugby\) underwent a major redesign in 2017 to make it more user friendly with a greater amount of information directed towards young players. The site receives approximately 200,000 hits per year and has greatly enhanced the RFUs ability to offer high quality nutritional advice **\[G\]**.  A further significant change generated from the research can be seen in the education provision offered to players by the RFU. The advice offered significantly shifted from Season 2017/18 away from a compliance perspective to a more player welfare centric approach.  Over 2000 young players have benefited from the revised education workshops where a greater emphasis has been placed upon interaction with the issues raised in the LBU research **\[G\]**. 

 **Directing global whistleblowing policy and guidance on reporting mechanisms in sport** 

 LBU research on reporting on doping in sport has directly impacted the policies, practices and processes of global anti\-doping organisations and the global sporting movement. For example, LBU’s research has been identified as *“Informing directly, the development of WADA’s whistleblowing policy* \[published in 2016\] *\(including helping with the naming of the online platform to support this, ‘Speak Up’\)”* **\[A\]**. By illuminating the emotional and relational dimension of reporting doping in sport, LBU research has offered a more holistic and relational perspective on the action of reporting wrongdoing and this is reflected in the 2019 International Olympic Committee \(IOC\) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \(UNODC\) Practical Guide for Development and Implementation on Reporting Mechanisms in Sport **\[H\]**. Specifically, LBU research directly informed one of the three key principles of the guide – trustworthiness. It also directly informed the global guidance on reporting interfaces, collaboration and support for reporting persons sections of the guide. The primary audience of this guide includes national and international federations, National Olympic Committees and the IOC; who support millions of athletes and support personnel across the world. By raising awareness of the barriers to reporting, direct action has been taken amongst national anti\-doping organisations. For example, LBU research has guided the education on whistleblowing within Doping Authority Netherlands “Gold” education programme **\[D\]**. UKAD acknowledged, as a consequence of LBU research, that *“there are longer\-term issues around people in sport not knowing how to report, and what to report, so that’s why we’re launching this campaign \[Protect Your Sport\]*” **\[J\]**. The Protect Your Sport campaign addresses some of the barriers LBU research evidenced by highlighting the various ways an athlete, coach or anyone with a suspicion that something’s not right can share that information and intelligence. It also emphasises the need for collective action to protect sporting integrity and athlete welfare, representing a significant shift in attitude, policy and practice from the established individual athlete responsibility and “catch the cheats” approach.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Insect pollinators, especially bees, benefit food security and biodiversity worldwide, with an annual economic value measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet many bee species, including 9% of Europe's bees, are threatened or declining. UEA research has led to impact to prevent or reverse such declines through two approaches. **Bourke**'s research provided a key part of the evidence base for the UK Government's Countryside Stewardship agri\-environment scheme for pollinators in England. **Dicks**'s research contributed to a set of global policy recommendations on pollinators for governments, which were then incorporated into a formal decision of the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity, in turn stimulating the European Union's Pollinators Initiative and national pollinator strategies in up to 30 countries across the world. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 
Animal pollination, to which bees are major contributors, is worth USD235\-577,000,000,000 \(12\-2016\) to annual global crop production and its loss would reduce production by 5\-8%. Pollinating bees comprise wild bees and managed populations of honeybees. Both contribute essential natural pollination services, and both are experiencing declines from a broad set of causes. These declines are most severe in wild bees, with 9% of European species assessed as Threatened. Hence research on how best to prevent or reverse wild bee declines is widely recognised as urgently needed. **Bourke** and **Dicks** have conducted empirical, field\-based studies and large\-scale data syntheses that have provided the evidence for government interventions and stimulated global policy development to aid wild bees and other pollinators. 

 <ins> *Providing evidence for</ins> <ins>UK</ins> <ins>G</ins><ins>overnment</ins> <ins></ins><ins>interventions</ins> <ins></ins><ins>to aid</ins> <ins>pollinators*</ins>: A frequently\-used government intervention to aid pollinators within agricultural landscapes is to pay land managers to plant strips of flowers along arable field margins to provide floral resources for pollinators. However, little evidence existed to demonstrate the effectiveness of such agri\-environment schemes or to guide the scale over which they should be implemented. **Bourke** was Joint PI on a major collaborative project under the UK's Insect Pollinators Initiative \[Grant A\] designed to address these questions. This large\-scale project investigated the spatial ecology of bumblebees \( *Bombus* species; see image\), which form the main group of wild bee pollinators in temperate countries. The team used a novel combination of field ecology, remote sensing, DNA analysis and landscape modelling to determine the relationship between bees' use of space and the siting of floral resources in five representative bumblebee species \[R1\-R3\]. The study area was in arable farmland experimentally planted with floral margins for pollinators based on the UK Government's existing agri\-environment scheme for England \[R1\]. 

 By measuring workers' colony\-specific foraging distances \(average distance flown by workers from a given nest to flower patches\), the research showed that workers forage more closely to their nests in areas with greater coverage of semi\-natural vegetation, including planted floral margins \[R2, R3\]. This suggested that planting these margins helps bee populations by reducing the energy workers spend on foraging longer distances \[R2\]. In the first analysis of its kind, the research also showed that bumblebee nests within 250\-1,000m of high\-quality floral resources are significantly more likely to have daughter queens surviving to the following spring \[R3\]. Overall, the findings both confirmed the value of agri\-environment schemes for pollinators and indicated the spatial and temporal scale of the floral resources required for such interventions to be effective \[R1\-R3\]. In particular, the team's research allowed it to estimate the proportion of agricultural landscape \(1\-3%\) that would need to contain flower\-rich habitat for the foraging distances of bumblebee workers to be maintained at or below their species averages \[R2\]. 

 <ins> *Stimulating</ins> <ins>g</ins><ins>lobal p</ins><ins>olicy</ins> <ins>development</ins> <ins>to aid</ins> <ins>pollinators*</ins>: **Dicks** was a Co\-ordinating Lead Author of the UN's Inter\-governmental Science\-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services \(IPBES\) thematic assessment on pollinators, pollination and food production \[S4\]. By synthesising results and data from hundreds of scientific studies, this international collaboration produced the largest ever global assessment of pollinators. **Dicks** led the team producing the chapter on policy responses \[S4\], key findings of which were published in \[R4\]. Based on the information thereby acquired on the benefits provided by pollinators, the scale of their global declines and the threats they face, **Dicks** then led the development of 10 specific global policy recommendations for pollinators. These were developed through consultation with the scientific advice body \(Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice, SBSTTA\) to the Convention on Biological Diversity, which is the UN's international treaty on biodiversity arising from the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. The 10 policy recommendations were published by **Dicks** and co\-authors in \[R5\] and were to: *""1. Raise pesticide regulatory standards. 2. Promote integrated pest management \(IPM\). 3. Include indirect and sublethal effects in GM crop risk assessments. 4. Regulate movement of managed pollinators. 5. Develop incentives, such as insurance schemes, to help farmers benefit from ecosystem services instead of agrochemicals. 6. Recognize pollination as an agricultural input in extension services. 7. Support diversified farming systems. 8. Conserve and restore 'green infrastructure' \(a network of habitats that pollinators can move between\) in agricultural and urban landscapes. 9. Develop long\-term monitoring of pollinators and pollination. 10. Fund participatory research on improving yields in organic, diversified, and ecologically intensified farming""* \[R5\]. 

 **Dicks** and collaborators also published a research report for the Convention on Biological Diversity that synthesised evidence for the value of pollinators beyond their agricultural value \(e.g. ecological, cultural, financial, health, human and social value\) \[R6\]. **Dicks** contributed an entire section \(Section 5.4, amounting to c. 10%\) of this extensive report. **Dicks** conducted her work on global policy development for pollinators both before and after joining UEA in 2016 \[Grant B\], having previously been at the University of Cambridge from 2008, with the underpinning outputs \[R4\-R6\] having been published when at UEA.

 4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> *Providing evidence for</ins> <ins>UK</ins> <ins>G</ins><ins>overnment interventions</ins> <ins>to aid</ins> <ins>pollinators*</ins>: **Bourke**'s research has had impact through informing public policy with research evidence. This had led to changes in government regulations to enhance pollination services and biodiversity, so aiding pollinators and thereby benefiting agricultural practitioners and the environment. 

 In 2015 the UK Government launched a new version of Countryside Stewardship, its agri\-environment scheme for England, to run to 2020 \[S1\]. Countryside Stewardship provides financial incentives to farmers, foresters and land managers to care for and improve the environment, including wildlife habitats. Via regular dialogue between the team and contacts in Natural England/Defra, the research of **Bourke** and collaborators \[R1\-R3\] provided a key component of the evidence base for Countryside Stewardship's pollinator\-focused actions. In particular, the team's finding \[R2\] that a coverage of 1\-3% of agricultural landscape by flower\-rich habitat would allow bumblebee workers to forage at or below their species\-average foraging distance directly informed the Wild Pollinator and Farm Wildlife Package within Countryside Stewardship. This Package is the set of farmland management options, including the planting of floral margins alongside arable fields, designed to benefit wild pollinators and other farm wildlife. Specifically, the finding defined the minimum area threshold for option coverage within the Package, i.e., at least 3% total area to be planted with floral margins, this threshold being mandatory for the scheme's Mid\-Tier version or higher \[S1\]. It also informed the package's advice to select a combination of options and to distribute them spatially within farms \[S1\]. Evidencing this, the Countryside Stewardship Manual stated, *""Recent evidence suggests that applying the right combination of options over 3 to 5% of the arable, temporary grass or permanent grass included in an application will deliver meaningful benefits to farm wildlife""* \[S1\]. In addition, as Natural England's Nature Recovery Team stated, *""The research findings of the IPI bumble bee project team helped to set the 3% minimum threshold for option coverage in the CS Wild Pollinator and Farm Wildlife Package""* \[S2\]. Moreover, the package has *""helped in an overall increase in the delivery of land management options such as flower\-rich grass margins and pollen and nectar mixes, which are crucially important in helping to provide the year\-round life cycle needs of pollinating insects""* \[S2\]. Although it is too early to determine if any interventions since 2015 have increased UK bee numbers, a 2019 study concluded that, against general trends for pollinators, crop\-pollinating bees increased by 12% in Britain between 1980 and 2013 and that this could be due to previous agri\-environment schemes, which were similar in kind if not in scale to those implemented by Countryside Stewardship \[S3\]. 

 <ins> *Stimulating</ins> <ins>global policy development</ins> <ins>to aid</ins> <ins>pollinators*</ins>: **Dicks**'s research has had a suite of primary and downstream impacts stimulating and influencing the policy and practice of governments and international agencies as regards safeguarding pollinators and pollination services, so benefiting agricultural practitioners and the environment on a global scale. 

 The primary impact has been that the UN's multilateral treaty body for biodiversity, the Convention on Biological Diversity, agreed two formal decisions that draw heavily on the work of the global IPBES pollinator assessment \[S4\] and outputs \[R4\-R6\] co\-authored by **Dicks** \[S5\]. This followed an approach to **Dicks** and co\-authors by the secretariat of the Convention \[S5\]. As a UN treaty, this Convention has 196 party countries and 168 signatories. Its Decision XIII/15 \[S6\], taken at the Convention conference in Mexico in late 2016 \(COP13\), formally endorsed the key messages of the assessment \[S4\] that were included and further developed in \[R4\] and \[R5\]. It also listed specific actions for Governments to follow, and these included all 10 policy recommendations in \[R5\]. In short, each policy recommendation in \[R5\] by **Dicks** and collaborators has been incorporated into a formal decision of a UN treaty body \[S6\]. As the Deputy Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity stated, *""… I approached a number of the authors* \[of the IPBES assessment\] *, including Dr. Dicks, for scientific inputs in drafting policy recommendations for Governments with a view to including these in a draft SBSTTA* \[Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice to the Convention\] *recommendation. … At the same time, Dr. Dicks led the development of a scientific paper published as* \[Dicks et al. 2016 *Science*, R5\] *. The thinking behind the paper informed the development of the SBSTTA policy recommendations, and indeed, the policy recommendations in the* Science *paper and the SBSTTA recommendations are very closely aligned. The paper* \[R5\] *also helped … give added scientific weight to the Convention's draft recommendations, helping their formal adoption by Governments at the thirteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties* \[COP13\] *. With only minor changes, the policy recommendations were subsequently adopted by the COP as decision XIII/15 in December 2016""* \[S5\]. 

 Following up, in a further decision on pollinators, Decision 14/6 \[S7\] taken at the Convention on Biological Diversity's conference in Egypt in 2018 \(COP14\), the Convention mandated the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation to implement a joint Plan of Action for the conservation and sustainable use of pollinators. This plan \[S7\] again included the actions recommended by \[R5\], and cited \[R6\] as major support, i.e. **Dicks**'s collaborative research synthesising the contributions of pollinators beyond their agricultural value such as value for society and quality of life. 

 Prompted by the Convention on Biological Diversity's formal Decision XIII/15, two major, global\-scale downstream impacts have also occurred. One is that a collaboration of Governments across the world created ""Promote Pollinators, a Coalition of the Willing on Pollinators"". With a founding membership \(including the UK\) of 14 countries in 2016, by 2020 this coalition included 30 countries, each committed to developing its own national pollinator strategy \[S8\]. Evidencing this, its website states: *""Promote Pollinators was established in December 2016 as the result of deliberations during* \[COP13, = Decision XIII/15 conference\] *. During this conference, …, fourteen countries decided to unite and collaborate in an international coalition, in order to bring about progress in the protection of pollinating species and their habitats""* \[S8\]. The other downstream impact is that, in 2018, citing Decision XIII/15, the European Commission launched its own European Union Pollinators Initiative \[S9\]. This is an EU\-wide strategy to address pollinator declines across Europe, which from January 2019 has been implemented in collaboration with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and the Institute for European Environmental Policy \[S10\]. 

 Overall, both the primary and downstream impacts of the work of **Dicks** and collaborators have had a positive and ongoing effect on UN and Government actions for pollinators. As the Deputy Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity has stated, Decision XIII/15, \[S4\] and \[R5\] *""have fostered increased efforts by Governments and stakeholders on this crucial issue for biodiversity, and the issue of pollinators and pollination is likely to feature explicitly in the post\-2020 global biodiversity framework currently in development under the Convention""* \[S5\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at the University of Leeds European Centre for the Responsibility to Protect \(ECR2P\) has changed policies on mass atrocity prevention at the United Nations \(UN\), informed United Kingdom \(UK\) government policy, and contributed evidence and capacity in the wider policy community. It changed UN policy on the inclusion of partners from the Global South, altering UN strategies to enhance the legitimacy and practice of the R2P prevention and protection agendas. ECR2P research also influenced the mainstreaming of R2P mass atrocity considerations into the UK’s foreign policy and its promotion of stabilisation rather than intervention. ECR2P collective research provided new evidence\-bases for a wide range of UK organisations, including NGOs and select committees, changing understandings on how to create more effective atrocity responses.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Responsibility to Protect \(R2P\) ‘embodies a political commitment to end the worst forms of violence and persecution’ \( [UN](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/about-responsibility-to-protect.shtml)\). Amidst the resurgence of violent conflict there has been significant increase in atrocity crimes \(genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing\) as evidenced by the fact that of the 81 UN Security Council Resolutions that invoke the R2P, 77 of them occurred since 2011. ECR2P aims to reduce atrocity harm and risk by providing research\-based evidence to states and international organisations in their efforts to protect populations from mass atrocities. Launched in 2016, the year the World Bank reported that more countries experienced violent conflict than at any time in nearly 30 years, it is the only European centre on R2P and is a leading research and advisory group, from which the impact outlined in this case study arose.  ECR2P is distinguished from the two other global R2P centres \(Global Centre for R2P, Asia\-Pacific Centre for R2P\) by its pragmatic policy reform approach, which seeks to critically address and then locate often overlooked policy alterations that can bring about incremental and realisable reform to mass atrocity prevention policy. Comprising six staff and six PGR members from POLIS, the ECR2P operates an active engagement policy via problem\-focused research, consultancy, fieldwork partnerships, public engagement, and informing policy and practice at the UN, European and UK levels. This includes active evidence\-generating links with the UN Office for Genocide Prevention and R2P, and several key organisations in the UK and EU working on human protection and atrocity prevention. Three key research activities underpin the impact below. 

 1\) Research conducted by ECR2P staff pertaining to UN processes and thinking on R2P and atrocity prevention strategies has argued for broadening the consultative processes shaping UN member\-state policies and perceptions of R2P, contributing empirical evidence towards better legitimating R2P policy development. For example, Stefan’s research argued for an increased role for non\-permanent UN Security Council \(UNSC\) members and for the inclusion of alternative R2P views, such as those of Brazil and others in the Global South, to consolidate R2P legitimacy and support **\[1\]**. Similarly, Ralph’s and Gallagher’s research on UNSC competence **\[3,6\]** and Stefan’s collaborative research for the UN **\[2\]** stressed legitimacy concerns triggered by the limited implementation of R2P through Security\-Council decision\-making and the ‘use of force’ component of R2P. Ralph’s research on the role the UK plays in the UNSC also highlights legitimacy challenges for R2P moving forward post\-Brexit **\[6\]**. Stefan’s first\-of\-a\-kind study on ‘Lessons Learnt from Guinea’ **\[2\]** demonstrated that a specific combination of preventative, diplomatic, political and juridical tools could be employed at the UN when risk factors of the type seen in post\-election Guinea are noticed elsewhere. 

 2\) ECR2P research has collectively examined the need for states to better mainstream atrocity prevention into foreign policy ‘stabilisation’ efforts and to ensure respect for international humanitarian and human rights law within the main tenets of R2P implementation **\[1,2\]**, especially when applying the R2P framework to specific case studies, such as Libya and Syria **\[3\-6\]**. In particular, Ralph’s research into UK government approaches to atrocity prevention provided concrete suggestions for mainstreaming R2P into UK foreign policy, demonstrating that the UK government needed to adjust its conflict analysis processes, clarify its position on R2P ‘focal points’, re\-write its stabilisation policies to prioritize atrocity prevention **\[5\]**, and redesign its role within the UN Security Council **\[6\]** in a post\-Brexit context **\[7\]**. Similarly, Stefan’s research stresses the importance of identifying non\-military tools available to operationalize R2P **\[1\]**, derived from successful preventative examples of R2P **\[2\]**, which has also informed ECR2P training of military personnel in Doha, Qatar. 

 3\) ECR2P research provided insights on ongoing R2P\-related developments in Libya **\[1,3\]**, Syria **\[3,4,6\]** and other mass atrocity situations **\[2,4,6\]**, which informed the presentation of evidence to a number of UK select committees and UK\-based institutions working on protection, prevention, and R2P. The insights stem from a body of research providing acute analysis on how, when, and under what circumstances, military intervention may play a role in the operationalisation of the R2P. This includes investigating complex and ongoing challenges associated with mass atrocity in Libya and Syria **\[3,4\]**, and what effective response parameters are available within the R2P framework and international law **\[1\-3,6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 ECR2P research is shaping the development of R2P policy in three significant ways: i\) by the Centre becoming an evidence\-generating knowledge hub changing policy understandings within the wider R2P policy community through global intellectual leadership; ii\) setting the agenda and changing policy at the UN, and iii\) shaping UK policy on mainstreaming R2P and atrocity prevention. 

 **i\) ECR2P has become an evidence\-generating knowledge hub changing stakeholder understanding, strategies and policies for preventing mass atrocity**. Since 2016, the scope of policy engagement and influence by ECR2P is illustrated by repeated invitations to its members to contribute written and oral research evidence to the UK Defence Select Committee and Foreign Affairs Select Committees and through directly influencing the work of NGOs and charitable organisations in the UK, such as the United Nations Association UK \(UNA\-UK\) and Protection Approaches **\[A,B\]**, which are the two flagship UK organisations working on protection, prevention of atrocities and R2P, and who are now affiliated partners with ECR2P \(see **iii\)** below\). As just one set of examples, Gallagher presented research with follow\-up oral evidence to the House of Commons Defence Committee on Iraq and Syria and threats posed by ISIS in October 2014. Gallagher’s evidence\-base was cited in the CDC report on ISIS in Iraq and Syria \(p. 16\) and provided influential recommendations on the legality of airstrikes in Iraq and Syria **\[C\]**. A former MP and Defence Committee member remarks: ‘ *Dr Gallagher played a key role in shaping the Committee’s understanding of this topic which is reflected in the fact that the final report cites his evidence \[which\] helped the Committee differentiate between legal and illegal action under the Responsibility to Protect framework’* **\[D\]**. In addition, Gallagher was invited to give written evidence on ‘The Extent and Effectiveness of Post\-Conflict Planning in Libya’ to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, which was cited in its final report \(2016\-17, pp. 26\-27\) **\[E\]**. Written evidence from Gallagher and Ralph provided post\-Brexit strategy recommendations to a 2018 Foreign Affairs Select Committee on ‘Global Britain: R2P and Humanitarian Intervention’ \(Report, pp. 6, 8, 10\) **\[F\]**. In non\-governmental settings, ECR2P has directly influenced The UK Working Group on Atrocity Prevention, an umbrella group which includes all UK organisations focusing on reducing the risk of mass atrocities worldwide and on influencing the UK government policy on the topic. This UK Working Group has drawn upon ECR2P’s research expertise and findings **\[5\]** to inform about which R2P policies to lobby the UK government **\[A,B\]**, specifically within a post\-Brexit context. 

 **ii\) Directly influencing and shaping UN agenda on R2P and atrocity prevention** through formal partnership agreements and consultancies to the UN Office on Genocide Prevention and the R2P. As detailed below, these activities include the development of policy to change the UN Office’s consultancy process with UN Member States, direct contributions towards redefining the strategic priorities of the UN Joint Office, drafting contributions to the UN Secretary\-General’s Annual Report on R2P, and providing analysis and research\-based critical evidence synthesis to shape the development of prevention\-oriented policy through the UN’s Atrocity Prevention Assessment project **\[G,H\]**. 

 One of Stefan’s research contributions highlights the importance of including states from the Global South in designing R2P\-related responses at the UN **\[1\]**. This is critical, because while most atrocity prevention efforts occur in the Global South, states from these regions are often absent from policy design and decision\-making at the UN, thereby undermining both the legitimacy and efficacy of R2P interventions. Her analysis was used during the organisation of preliminary discussions running up to the drafting of the Secretary\-General’s Annual Report on the R2P, during Stefan’s secondment to the UN in May\-June 2017. It was during this secondment that Stefan’s recommendation to broaden inclusion of regional powers like Brazil within preliminary UN discussions was adopted by the UN Office. The former UN Special Advisor to the Secretary\-General on R2P remarks: ‘ *Dr. Stefan’s research on legitimating R2P processes within the UN, and the need to include emerging powers such as Brazil, has made us reconsider the role of Member States from the Global South and to change the way we invite and encourage these actors to participate in R2P related processes and decision\-making. This change in policy has been a crucial first step towards making the R2P more inclusive, and more representative of regional perspectives, thus increasing R2P’s legitimacy*’ **\[G\]**. This inclusion ‘ *has* *directly changed the way the UN Office engages with the policy preferences from the Global South*’ and provided strategic opportunities for R2P advancement in terms of increased legitimacy and support **\[G\]**. 

 Stefan was asked by the R2P Special Advisor to the Secretary General to contribute written text to the 2017 UN Secretary\-General’s report on *‘*Implementing the Responsibility to Protect: Accountability for Prevention’, which acknowledges the regional potential towards the prevention of atrocities **\[G\]**. Stefan’s research\-based evidence **\[1,2\]** informed the *2017 UN Report on R2P* to stress the relationship between legitimate processes, Security Council processes, and the need for collaborative work, with Stefan being *‘the first to propose including a section on the important role played by regional players, to highlight the need for collaborative efforts to address atrocities effectively* … *In the longer term, this will lead to much greater legitimacy in the UN’s operationalization of R2P’* **\[G\]**. The final report was submitted to the Secretary\-General and his executive office. Stefan was also consulted by *Strategy for Humanity,* an organisation commissioned to conduct a strategic review of the priorities of the UN Office on Genocide Prevention and R2P in 2016. The former Head of the UN Office on Genocide Prevention and R2P affirms that Stefan’s ‘ *recommendations pertaining to strategic priorities for the Responsibility to Protect agenda at the United Nations contributed to the subsequent recalibration of the Joint Office’s strategy and priorities’* **\[H\]**. 

 As a result of Stefan shaping UN thinking on inclusionary R2P practices, the UN Special Advisor on R2P invited her to contribute to a new Atrocity Prevention Assessment project, designed to inform the United Nations’ overall policy on atrocity prevention **\[G,H\]**. The project’s *‘final report is shaping UN’s policy on atrocity prevention, being the first comprehensive UN assessment of prevention risk factors’* **\[G\]**. Stefan’s research on Guinea **\[2\]** was one of seven cases informing the Atrocity Prevention Assessment project **\[G,H\]**, and *‘supplied an evidence\-base for \[UN Office\] prevention analysis and identified the combination of effective preventive tools used in Guinea, which the UN could replicate elsewhere under similar conditions and in collaborations with regional and national actors’* **\[H\]**. The prevention measures that Stefan identified *‘provided useful examples to inform our \[UN Joint Office\] overall prevention assessment and further recommendations, \[which\] aimed to facilitate practical implementation’* **\[H\]**. From Stefan’s research findings, *‘the UN Joint Office was able to incorporate the evidence into the final assessment, which made a significant contribution to \[UN Office\] overall thinking and prevention strategy’* **\[G\]**. The overall assessment *‘produced lessons learned to advance atrocity prevention and to improve cost effectiveness* ... *The project also provided practical implementation advice for the United Nations Secretary\-General’s overall prevention vision’* **\[G\]**. 

 **iii\) Influencing UK policy on R2P and atrocity prevention** through formal partnership agreements, research collaborations, and the production of policy reports for key institutions working on prevention and protection in the UK. Ralph’s research on R2P in the UK context **\[3,5\]** has directly changed UK advocacy groups’ policy recommendations as well as their efforts to inform UK government policy in its effort to develop more effective strategies to prevent mass atrocities through the R2P **\[A,B\]**. The Director of Protection Approaches, one of the UK’s leading advocacy groups on ending identity\-based violence, states, *‘\[Ralph’s\] recommendations on how to integrate atrocity prevention into government practices significantly helped to shape our thinking on UK R2P mainstreaming, and we both incorporated its findings and cited the report in our own policy brief of May 2018, Towards a national approach to atrocities’* **\[5,B\]**. Similarly, the Head of Policy at UNA\-UK states that Ralph’s research *‘formed the centrepiece of our lobbying efforts in this area*’, and they invited him to write its briefing report on *Mainstreaming the Responsibility to Protect in UK Strategy* **\[5\]** and to co\-write a second report on ‘Global Britain’ **\[I\]**. The first report was presented in the UK Parliament in April 2014 and was made the focus for discussion at a one\-day practitioner workshop on the R2P hosted by the UNA\-UK at the British Academy. According to the Head of Policy for UNA\-UK, ‘ *it was through the publication of the report that we were able to get the government to clarify who the UK R2P Focal Point was’* **\[A\]**, designating Paul Arkwright as the first of several diplomats to hold this position – in\-line with Ralph’s recommendation to heighten the significance of the role **\[A\]**. Similarly, Ralph’s co\-authored report on R2P and Global Britain **\[I\]** was presented in the UK Parliament and to the House of Lords in February 2019. Following these engagements, in July 2019 the Foreign & Commonwealth Office Policy Paper on the UK’s Approach to Preventing Mass Atrocities **\[J\]** explained that *‘\[g\]iven that the majority of atrocities occur in and around conflict, the UK has dedicated significant resources to addressing crises and conflict by means of a comprehensive cross\-governmental response’* and also stressed the usefulness of the Joint Analysis of Conflict and Stability assessment tool \(JACS\) for the identification of situation\-specific interventions, both of which were recommendations made in Ralph’s UNA\-UK report \( **\[5\]**, pp.14\-19; 26\-27\). As confirmed by the Head of Policy at UNA\-UK **\[A\]**: ‘ *The analysis and recommendations of the report formed the basis of subsequent UNA\-UK lobbying efforts on R2P, and these have, through the collective efforts of the Working Group \[on Atrocity Prevention\], helped to deliver change in UK policy.  In particular, and in response to the Foreign Affairs Committee’s recent call for a coherent and more precise strategy on atrocity prevention, Foreign Office Minister Lord Ahmed promised to do more in this area*’. Likewise, the Head of Protection Approaches **\[B\]** writes: ‘ *Prof. Ralph’s underpinning research, combined with these efforts across civil society, has impressed upon the government the need for more systematic thinking in this area. The Foreign Secretary and Foreign Office Minister have stated publicly that they are committed to do more to prevent atrocity and government departments, including the Foreign Office and Stabilisation Unit, who are now reaching out to Protection Approaches and ECR2P for advice on how to change strategy and practices, including CSSF and JACS*’, a research recommendation of Ralph **\[5\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Complex multilevel datasets are a challenge to analyse, especially for non\-specialists, but are fundamental to answer questions in diverse settings. The University of Bristol’s Centre for Multilevel Modelling \(CMM\) addressed this by incorporating its cutting\-edge statistical research into our widely used MLwiN multilevel modelling software, face\-to\-face training and training materials. This has significantly increased the number of non\-academics and non\-specialists equipped to apply these techniques in their work. These users have transformed the application of new statistical practices within government departments \(such as the UK Home Office\) and other non\-academic organisations \(such as the UK Office for Students and the Eurofound European Agency in Dublin\) in the UK and overseas, empowering them to improve the accuracy of evidence\-based decision making. Since August 2013, MLwiN has been purchased by 191 non\-academic organisations internationally. This includes the UK Home Office, who commissioned bespoke training from CMM researchers, enabling multilevel modelling techniques to be applied to crime and policing policy. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Often the data underlying decision making in policy, companies and agencies \(particularly in social science contexts\) has a complex hierarchical, nested or clustered structure. For example, educational outcomes might be impacted by national, local authority, school and teacher effects in complex interacting dependencies. These effects need to be accounted for to allow reliable decision making. 

 Since 2004, the Centre for Multilevel Modelling has developed new statistical methodology to fit such complex models. Much of the fundamental underpinning work is summarised in **Goldstein**’s seminal book **\[1\],** which is widely used across social, medical and biological sciences, receiving 12631 citations \(Google Scholar, January 2021\). 

 Examples of novel statistical developments in CMM work include: 

-  extending multilevel models to account for spatially correlated effects \(e.g. student outcomes\) **\[2\]**, 

-  introduction of re\-parameterisation techniques within Markov chain Monte Carlo \(MCMC\) algorithms for fitting multi\-level models, increasing statistical efficiency and hence enabling significantly larger and more complex data structures to be analysed \(e.g. survival analysis\) **\[3\]**, 

-  novel multilevel modelling formulations for complex non\-hierarchical data structures \(e.g., combination of schools and neighbourhoods on pupil performance\) **\[4\]**, 

-  methodological research on the problems of missing data and measurement errors \(e.g., in birth cohort studies and longitudinal surveys\) **\[5\]**, 

-  advanced multilevel modelling for analysis of longitudinal data with multilevel structure \(e.g., school league tables\) **\[6\]** 

 A key aspect of CMM’s work is translating these statistically novel but computationally intensive methodology developments into user\-friendly statistical software packages \(such as MLwiN, Stat\-JR, Realcom and MLPowSim\) to allow direct access to new methods for applied researchers **\[1\-6\]**. This translation is performed by the programming team, currently led by **Charlton**. These packages are accompanied by extensive user documentation and training disseminated via face\-to\-face user workshops and online training materials, including the Learning Environment for Multilevel Modelling \(LEMMA\) online multilevel modelling course developed as part of ESRC LEMMA grants **\[vii\]** which brings the methodology and software to a very wide audience.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Our research has strongly built capacity for advanced statistical skills in non\-academic and non\-specialist users and directly informed policy development in the UK public sector and Government. 

#  Building capacity of professional statisticians and quantitative researchers to improve robustness of decision making by applying multilevel modelling techniques 

 Our flagship MLwiN software package **\[5\]** now has over 15,000 users. Since 1<sup>st</sup> August 2013 it has been purchased by a further 191 new non\-academic organisations **\[A\]**, including the UK Home Office **\[F\]** and US FDA Office of Acquisitions and Grants Service. MLwiN is part of a suite of software packages including Stat\-JR, Realcom and MLPowSim which are either supplied with MLwiN or as freeware. 

 The linked LEMMA training course contains 15 graduated modules starting from an introduction to quantitative research and progressing to multilevel modelling of continuous, binary, ordinal, and nominal data. There are now over 37,000 users of LEMMA with over 25,000 new users since 1 August 2013, 80% of whom are international. Since August 2013 there are over 10,000 new non\-academic users **\[B\]**. 

 Since 2008, we have led annual courses with the Royal Statistical Society in London during which we have trained 79 participants \(of whom 21 were government statisticians and 11 industry statisticians\) including participants from the Swedish National Agency for Education, the UK Government Department for Health, Google and Virgin Media **\[C\].** Each year, the course has received excellent feedback, with an average score of 9.4 out of 10 agreeing the course will benefit their professional work. 

 Our model supports policy makers in robust analysis to inform decision making. For example, following one of these courses the Eurofound European Agency in Dublin requested a bespoke course to support analysis of employment status in Europe. The successful delivery of this course gave their workers the skillset to *“\[use\] a multilevel approach … which allows it to separate micro\-/workplace\-level and contextual effects. The conclusions of this research contribute towards the on\-going EU policy debate on job quality and non\-standard employment*.” **\[C\].** Both this example, and feedback from Ofsted **\[D\]**, point to the importance of this robust analysis to inform policy makers; *‘the training course was very helpful for us in building our skills in data analysis we undertake on a regular basis which seeks to improve the overall quality of education and training in the UK, and inform policy makers about the effectiveness’* **\[D\].** 

 Our software packages \(MLwiN and Stat\-JR\) are also used for training courses delivered by other researchers around the world. Since 2013 there have been over 30 courses open to non\-academic participants, including 19 through the National Centre for Research Methods in the UK. Courses have run in Australia, Canada and Germany **\[E\]**, for example at the University of Queensland, Australia open to non\-academic participants **\[E\]**. 

 A recent British Academy grant **\[iii\]** supported CMM in further developing our Stat\-JR software to automate the creation of training materials. This encourages others to work with us. For example, recently the UK Data Service have used Stat\-JR to develop online training using their own national data resources, with a significant effect on their internal training strategy. They expect the materials produced to benefit researchers through learning basic statistics techniques using key UK datasets. Their Director of User Support and Training stated: *“The materials produced \[…\] will make this dataset more visible to our wide community of existing researchers, help our training effort and attract new users to our resources.*”  **\[J\]**. 

#  Informing educational, economic and social policy development by UK Public Sector & Government Services 

 Since August 2013, our statistical research \(including **\[1\-6\]** above\) and software have been cited in over 25 national and international government and NGO reports in the areas of education and children’s services, community services, welfare services, public health, energy and climate change and agriculture and defence. These reports include those by several UK government departments, the World Health Organisation, Public Health England, Defence Research and Development Canada, and Ofqual. This demonstrates the extensive application of Bristol research to analyse complex data sets, and has fed into policy and practice decisions. 

 In 2017, the Home Office approached CMM to apply our expertise in multilevel modelling to analyse the geographical predictors of crime and incidents. This was part of the development of a key policing policy and resulted in a substantial report \(the report is confidential and not currently in the public domain\) informing national policing strategy **\[F\].** This commission from the Home Office **\[ii\]** also involved training government statisticians to ensure the analysis can be replicated with each new year of data, as well as applying multilevel modelling techniques to future policing policy. The Head of Policing and Police Resources Team, Crime and Policing Analysis, Home Office confirmed that “ *The capacity of our analytical team to undertake advanced multilevel statistical analysis has been markedly improved”* and in addition *“Our analysts have been able to apply these techniques to at least one other project, unconnected to the original commission.”* **\[F\]**. 

 We have worked with the Higher Education Funding Council for England \(HEFCE, now Office for Students\) to answer several questions, including fair admission to university for different ethnic groups, with results included in their reports on these topics.  In 2014, Browne was approached \(based on his sample size calculations work on the MLPowSim package\) to help HEFCE with a consultation on the UniStats website about reducing threshold levels below which data cannot be shown. We were able to supply research\-based statistical support to the proposal to reduce the threshold from 23 to 10 students, as well as indicating the need for more transparency in the methods and statistical uncertainty in the presentation of data **\[H\].** Our recommendations were implemented by HEFCE, with the Head of Research Analysis, Office for Students, stating: *“These changes mean that not only do prospective students have more data available on more courses at more institutions, but they are also supplied with additional resources to aid them in understanding the data presented to them.”*  **\[G, H\].** 

 Finally, our impact can be more indirect. For example, our research on missing data **\[5\]**, has been used by others to improve the statistical methodology employed to evaluate the effectiveness of at least three school\-based randomised control trials carried out by the Education Endowment Foundation **\[I\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Political conflict, terrorism and the war on terror pose a significant challenge for governments and NGOs across the world. The impact is based on research into the psychological processes associated with engaging in, and disengaging from, politically motivated violence and terrorism. This impact has had substantial national and international reach \(e.g. Academic Advisor to the UK Home Office\) and has directly influenced policy makers, the military, policing and the security services. The impact is also reflected in benefits to non\-governmental organization \(NGO\) groups, and been made accessible for wider audiences in order to raise awareness of and educate people on issues surrounding terrorism and political violence and its reduction. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Countering violent extremism and dealing with the impact of political violence is highly contested and policy is often contradictory, fraught with risk and devised in governmental silos with limited input from external voices. Additionally, the field of research in this area suffers from serious methodological issues, such as the lack of primary data that has a negative impact both on the creation of quality and reliable insights and on evidence\-based theory development. Ferguson has led research activity into the psychology of terrorism and political violence since 1996. Supported by academic staff and a series of postgraduate research students, he has built a well\-established reputation in this area in both academic and policy circles. 

 The research is underpinned by first\-hand primary accounts of violent extremism and terrorism from perpetrators of politically motivated violence rather than being based on secondary sources, databases or hypothetical modelling. The research is also distinctive as it explores the full extremist lifecycle from initial encounters with armed groups to desistance from violence \(see R1, R2, R4 & R5\). Its distinctive contributions can be described under three headings. 

 **Becoming Involved in Extremist Violence and Terrorism** 

 Ferguson’s research \(for example, outputs R2 & R6\) shows how everyday civilians are drawn towards extremism, begin to engage with extremist groups and enter violent and armed extremist groups. In doing this, the research charts various antecedent ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors at interpersonal, intergroup and societal levels, which contribute to the dynamic interplay between individual decision\-making and social context that lead to these ‘choices’. The research challenges common conceptions of ‘radicalisation’, downplaying the importance of ideological forces in motivating engagement in violence, and instead demonstrates how bonds of kinship and/or friendship and feelings of injustice and fear have a greater role to play. 

 **Sustaining Violent Extremism in the Face of Adversity** 

 More recently, Ferguson has explored the previously under\-researched second or middle phase in the terrorist lifecycle \(R1\) that focuses on how the extremist sustains their violent extremism in the challenging environment of being pursued by police, security forces and oppositional groups. This research builds on a series of earlier studies \(R5\) exploring the impact that this extremist lifestyle has on the militant and their families. This research demonstrates the importance of identity and small group pressures in bonding and psychologically protecting members of armed extremist groups as they develop militarily and ideologically in a hostile environment where they face daily threats of death or incarceration and the negative consequences of their violent actions. 

 **Desisting from Political Violence and Terrorism** 

 The third strand of research \(R3, R5\) focuses on disengagement from violent behaviour, ideological deradicalization and reintegration in society. In particular, the research explores how former extremists can make the transition away from employing violence towards peaceful means of civic or political engagement. 

 Together, this body of research offers insights for policy makers on how to efficiently discourage involvement with violent groups and encourage violent actors to disengage and details barriers to desistance that can hamper reintegration and problematize deradicalization endeavours.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 A range of groups both within the UK and globally, who are focused on reducing engagement in terrorism and political violence, have reported impact as a result of the underpinning research. The impact results from a wide range of activities including giving briefings, producing guides and reports grounded on the underpinning research, advising on and evaluating UK deradicalization practices, co\-creating educational resources and disseminating research through the media. The impact will be detailed in six sections below. 

 **UK Government** \[text removed for publication\] 

 Ferguson has worked with three UK Government ministries/departments and has provided briefings and consultancy to a number of Government departments. Ferguson \[text removed for publication\] has \(since 2018\) been part of an independent academic advisory committee providing expert insight on desistance, disengagement and deradicalization, and acts as a critical friend to the Home Office \(OSCT\) for their Disengagement and Desistence Programme for violent extremists. He was also involved in a number of Home Office sponsored conferences from 2017 aimed at sharing knowledge about disengagement and desistance from terrorism \(summary of conferences available in S1\). This work has been viewed by the Head of Research and Analysis for the Home Office OSCT as “very impactful” and “provided us with actionable advice for the near future” \(see S1\). Additionally, Ferguson has provided research briefings to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development \(see S2\) on issues around the reintegration of former combatants in Syria and elsewhere which were ""excellent...particularly thought\-provoking” and had “especial relevance"" \(Violent Extremism and Terrorism \(VET\) Hub Policy Manager, see S2\). 

 Ferguson has also provided briefings to Police Service of Northern Ireland, \[text removed for publication\] and the Northern Ireland Office \(2017, 2019\) on issues around Northern Irish related terrorism and how to aid the transitioning away from armed groups in Northern Ireland and has produced guides on Northern Irish Related Terrorism 

 **International Governments, Intelligence Agencies and Military** 

 In April 2018 Ferguson hosted a meeting of academics and staff from US Africa Command \(AFRICOM\), in addition to staff from the Home Office OSCT, for a three\-day workshop \(see S4\). The workshop explored linking research and policy in relation to the work of US Africa Command and OSCT. The Chief of Operations, US AFRICOM, stated \(see S4\) that the workshop “helped provide context to our \[US AFRICOM\] analysis of violent extremist organizations \(VEO's\). The workshop also reinforced, in my mind, the need to tie into academic research to allow us to maximize the potential impact of our policy recommendations"". 

 Ferguson has continued to support the US government. In 2019 he presented his research to the US military \(CENTCOM, EURCOM & AFRICOM\), US Intelligence services \(DIA\) and to the Joint Staff Strategic Multilayer Assessment Group at the Pentagon. The Director, Joint Staff Strategic Multilayer Assessment Group, at the Pentagon described the briefing \[S4\] as follows: “It is through exceptional scholarship and insights like yours that we develop the contextual understandings that lead to better decisions and strategies to cope with what is certain to be a generational challenge...your framings and guideposts may help us dampen the most detrimental outcomes and minimize harm through more thoughtful actions.” One outcome was that Ferguson’s research was used in two reports \(S4\) for the United States Department of Defense, Pentagon Joint Staff Strategic Multilayer Assessment Group, dealing with the reintegration of violent extremists back into their local communities and on strategies to break cycles of radicalization in young Syrians. 

 Ferguson’s research has also informed the Dutch and Australian Governments’ thinking about policy on challenging violence and creating mechanisms and strategies to reduce violence and radicalisation \[S5\]. The Head of Youth Policy at the Dutch Ministry for Health, Welfare and Sport \[see S5\] said that Ferguson’s research provided ""important food for thought for all policy makers attending"". In 2020 Ferguson was consulted by the Australian High Commission and his research was used by the Australian Federal Police Counter Terrorism Behavioural Science team \[S7\). 

 **Non\-Governmental Organizations, Counter Terrorism Practitioners and Expert Groups** 

 Ferguson’s research has been incorporated into the production of a number of consultative reports \[see S9\] for the British Council and the international charity Peace Direct \[S8\]. A noteworthy example of the impact of this is his work with the British Council in Pakistan \[S8\] on promoting violence reduction amongst Pakistani policy makers. 

 **Citizen Education and Media** 

 Ferguson’s work has attracted international media attention \[See S6 for examples\]. Ferguson worked with the BBC \(2014\) to co\-create a web\-based learning resource based on his research to educate people about the radicalisation process using the Troubles in Northern Ireland as an example of how civilians can get drawn into armed groups and which integrated BBC archival video content to illustrate the processes involved \[see S9\].

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Collaborative research led by Queen Mary and Baxter, which, in 2010, acquired the Queen Mary spin\-out ApaTech™, which was set up in 2001 to commercialise Queen Mary research, resulted in the UK launch of the synthetic bone graft substitute Inductigraft™ in 2013. Inductigraft has enhanced bioactivity comprising equivalent performance to the gold standard, autograft, and superior performance to other commercial synthetic bone graft \(SBG\) materials and allografts \(treated donor bone\).  It was launched in the US under the trade name AltaPore™, with FDA approval granted for use in orthopaedic procedures in extremities and the pelvis in 2017, and posterolateral spine fusion in September 2018. In 2018, a ‘flow’ version of Actifuse™ \(initially launched in 2005 by ApaTech, also based on Queen Mary research\) was launched, which provides a finer fraction of granules for narrow bore application. Approximately 24,000 procedures take place every year using Baxter products with 98.9% fusion rates. The move from autograft to Baxter synthetic bone grafts has led to reduced complication rates and enhanced patient outcomes. In 2019, a Royal Mail stamp, dedicated to the innovation of Actifuse™/Inductigraft™/AltaPore™ SBGs, was issued as part of the British Engineering Stamp collection. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Synthetic bone grafts \(SBGs\) are highly porous materials \(>60% porous\) often consisting of a ceramic with a calcium\-phosphate\-based chemistry and an open foam\-like porous structure, which mimics cancellous bone \(the internal tissue of skeletal bone\). The purpose of a SBG is to stimulate bone healing or regeneration where the skeleton’s natural regenerative abilities are impaired or insufficient. Early SBGs were variable in both effectiveness and reliability due to a lack of understanding of the body’s biological response to these materials and their characteristics. 

 The QMUL spin\-out ApaTech™ was established in 2001, built on the research undertaken under the directorship of Prof William Bonfield and Prof Serena Best, both at Queen Mary until 1999, working in collaboration with Prof Iain Gibson and Dr Hing. The team optimised graft chemistry and structure, and developed novel processing technology to deliver superior synthetic bone graft substitutes, ApaPore™ \(2001\) and Actifuse™ \(2005\), to the clinical market. The company was acquired by Baxter inc. in 2010. Since 2000, Dr Karin Hing at Queen Mary has built on the teams pioneering research, in response to earlier observations of the sensitivity of bone regeneration to graft chemistry, macro\-pore structure and strut permeability. Dr Hing has investigated the mechanisms through which minor fluctuations in SBG chemistry and strut porosity can either enhance or impair bone healing. This has led to work that demonstrates that bone regeneration can be further enhanced by manipulating the exact structural characteristics of the porous ceramic foam. This has led to further refinement of graft structure, resulting in SBGs with enhanced bioactivity, and the clinical launch of Inductigraft™/AltaPore™. 

 Dr. Hing’s work led to the understanding that the sensitivity of bioactivity to chemistry is dependent on both the pattern of inorganic ion exchange and surface selectivity of key proteins, which synergistically direct bone cell recruitment, metabolism and function \[3.1\]. Further research demonstrated that increasing strut porosity in SBGs enables a synthetic graft to stimulate osteoinductive\-like behaviour when implanted ectopically in a recognised model of osteoinductivity, and facilitates faster and more reliable bone regeneration \[3.2\]. This is particularly important in the treatment of patients with impaired bone biology, multi\-level spinal fusions or complicated trauma injuries. This work led to the successful filing of a patent by ApaTech/Baxter \[5.1\]. The launch of Inductigraft/AltaPore was underpinned by studies that \(1\) show efficacy of SBGs with increased strut\-porosity in a critical defect orthotopic model, as both an autograft extender \(using ‘patient’s’ own bone\), as a standalone SBG \[3.3\] and in a challenging spine fusion model \[3.4\] and \(2\) further probe the relative roles of graft chemistry \[3.5\] and structure in enhancing bone growth \[3.6\].

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Inductigraft \(AltaPore in the US\) is a bone void filler intended for gaps that are not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure. These defects may be surgically created or from traumatic injury. The product is reabsorbed and replaced by bone during the healing process. 

 Inductigraft and AltaPore are delivered through Baxter, and are based on the 2003 and 2009 ApaTech/Baxter patents \[5.1\]. AltaPore received FDA approval for use in orthopaedic procedures in extremities and the pelvis in 2013 and posterolateral spine fusions in September 2018 \[5.2\]. The Shape version \(malleable putty instead of granules delivered dry or in a sculptable carrier, ABX\) was launched in 2019. 

#  Enhanced patient health and well\-being 

##  Clinical superiority of Inductigraft/Altapore 

 Inductigraft/AltaPore has been clinically reported to have “excellent fusion rates” \[5.3\] according to Michael Mokawem, Consultant Orthopaedic and Spinal Surgeon, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust, with 98.9% fusion rates in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion and lateral lumbar interbody fusion surgery. 

 Mr. Mokawem further reported “12 months CT scans showing close to 100% fusion \(1 out of 150 failed\), whereas for other SBGs it would be 80\-92%.” Mr. Mokawem added that the Baxter products’ optimised levels of silicate and pore structures \(to facilitate development of interpenetrating vascular networks\) to “provide a microenvironment that facilitates osteoblasts to start bone formation” and have, thus, more reliable outcomes in surgery. The chemistry \(apatite based rather than tricalcium phosphate/calcium sulphate/calcium carbonate based\) means that these materials do not degrade chemically in the physiological environment. Any remodelling that happens is entirely cell mediated \(use of chemically biodegradable materials can result in complications\). Additionally, unlike traditional growth factor based treatments, Inductigraft/AltaPore is not contraindicated in skeletally immature individuals, which has enabled successful treatment of children and adolescents \[5.4\]. 

##  Improved patient outcomes 

 First, with use of Inductigraft/AltaPore, the surgeon is *“*able to reliably use Inductigraft without the need to harvest iliac crest bone to achieve excellent fusion rates, so eliminating the need for a second donor site with associated risks of infection, pain and complications associated with donor site morbidity,” according to Robert Lee, Consultant spinal surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital Stanmore \[5.5\]. Additionally, the use of SBGs means there is a reduced need for anaesthesia and, thus, reduced surgical risks to patients. This is because without the need to obtain autograft bone \(from the iliac crest\), the operative procedure is shorter so patients are anaesthetised for a reduced length of time. 

 Second, a patient treated with Inductigraft/AltaPore has a greater chance of avoiding reoperation or revision surgery because “the excellent fusion rates significantly contribute to the improvement in patient reported outcomes,” according to Mr. Lee \[5.5\]. Further, patients are typically released from hospital two to three days earlier, which has a positive effect on both the patient’s quality of life and that of their family, friends and work colleagues. 

 Finally, in clinical trials at month 12 post fusion, clinically significant decreases in disability were observed. Patients also reported reductions in pain and an improved quality of life post\-surgery. Motor, sensory functions, reflexes, straight leg raise and femoral stretches were either maintained, or improved in over half of patients \[5.6\]. 

#  Improved health economics \[5.4\] 

 Use of autograft involves two surgeries \(harvesting of the bone followed by implantation\), meaning 

-  The operation itself is prolonged 

-  Autograft harvesting procedures routinely have complications 

 For allograft and autograft, the risk of infection or immune rejection is significant vs SBGs where it is virtually zero. The percentage of patients returning with complications and requiring further surgery is therefore higher for allo/autograft, as, in the case of allografts, the bone has to be treated and sterilised before it is used. The faster bone growth associated with Baxter products also means that there is a reduced need for hardware, for example the insertion of metal supports. 

 The associated cost implications of the above are detailed in the table below: 

| Item | Baxter | Autograft | Growth factor therapy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Material cost /procedure | USD600\-800 | N/A | USD4,000\-8,000 |
| Operation time | 20% less than autograft, an average of 3 hours | \+USD1,000/operation ||
| Recovery time | 2\-3 days less than autograft, saving USD280/day | \+USD840/operation ||
| Complications | 21% less than autograft | \+USD6,000/operation | Potential for complications in 50% of cases |

 Based on approximately 24,000 procedures per year, Baxter products are estimated to save 

-  USD31,000,000 per year when compared to autograft\-based procedures 

-  USD74,000,000 per year when compared to growth factor\-based procedures 

#  Continued use of Actifuse™ \(launched in 2005\) in the current REF time period 

 Actifuse, launched in 2005 and the subject of a Queen Mary REF 2014 impact case study, is continuing to have a health impact. This is now expanding to areas outside of spinal injuries to knee injuries. A clinical study conducted between 2012 and 2015 found that clinical function outcomes after knee surgery using Actifuse vs autograft were comparable 3 years after surgery. The average operative time in the autograft group was 114 minutes, nearly double that in the Actifuse group \(64 minutes\), as using the SBG is a technically less demanding procedure than using harvested cancellous bone from the iliac crest. No complications occurred in the Actifuse group. In contrast, 1/20 patients in the autograft group required revision surgery at the donor site \[5.8\]. 

 In 2018, a ‘flow’ version of Actifuse was launched, which provides a finer fraction of granules for narrow bore application. It is unique in that it is non\-setting when injected \[5.4\]. Actifuse Flow comes ready to use with no mixing or preparation involved and maintains its consistency throughout surgery. The SBG is delivered directly from a pre\-loaded syringe with the ability to start and stop delivery, making use of Actifuse compatible with minimally invasive surgical techniques in addition to more traditional open surgery, increasing potential market size. 

#  Stimulated academic and public interest and attracted national/international recognition 

 In 2014, the Academia/Industry partnership, TERMIS\-EU \(Europe\) and TERMIS\-AM \(Americas\) Industry Committees used Baxter \(and ApaTech\) as a case study to demonstrate that there are a number of mechanisms by which industry can interact effectively with academia to transfer technologies to commercial partners \[5.9\]. 

 Outside of Queen Mary, Baxter products have been used as a biomedical technology ‘Laboratory Bench to Clinic’ case study in the syllabus of various undergraduate biomaterials/bioengineering degree programmes across the country.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Sheffield Hallam University research has improved teacher professional development \(PD\) in the UK and abroad by **shaping policy, encouraging investment and developing practice**. Research on teacher PD has informed UK government Department for Education **policy** in relation to early career teacher mentoring, professional qualifications in PD leadership and significant **investment** in national PD programmes. It has led to changes in the policies, practices and investment in PD activity of and by the Wellcome Trust, the Institute of Physics, and the Teacher Development Trust \- all influential **national educational organisations**. As outcomes of extensive knowledge exchange activity, underpinned by the research, over 300 leaders of teacher PD in England and Ghana have been directly **upskilled**. This has resulted in **practice improvements**, with more than 10,000 teachers receiving enhanced professional development directly linked to Sheffield Hallam PD projects, as well as many more benefitting from the wider investment in teacher PD informed by the research findings. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Boylan, Coldwell, Hobson, Maxwell and Perry have developed a substantial programme of research, through wide\-ranging evaluation and theoretical study of PD programmes, initiatives and PD leadership. Since 2007, the programme has encompassed over 50 research projects. External funding has exceeded £4.5 million, with studies funded by: government \(e.g. Department for Education \(DfE\) and its agencies such as the Teacher Development Agency\), government\-funded bodies \(e.g. the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics\), third sector organisations \(e.g. Gatsby Foundation\) and the private sector \(Wipro Ltd \- a global technology company headquartered in India\). 

 The research programme has focused on two inter\-related areas: 

####  The Positive Influences of Professional Development on Teacher Careers and Retention 

 Coldwell, Maxwell and colleagues undertook a set of projects \[ **R1**\- **R3**\], including a major longitudinal study of early career teachers \[ **R1**\]. They found that PD methods, including mentoring, influence teacher retention and career development. Key findings were: 

 1\) Teachers’ career aspirations firm up in their early years. Consequently, retention issues arise where new teachers’ experience low\-quality induction \[ **R1**\]. 

 2\) Teacher wellbeing is dependent on a wider range of individual, relational and environmental factors beyond basic psychological needs. This finding was based on secondary analysis of data from R1, another large\-scale five\-year study, and research on mentoring and coaching \[ **R2**\]. 

 3\) Intentions to stay in the profession were higher for teachers who engage in high\-quality PD. This was particularly due to improved knowledge and sense of efficacy; while the varying impact of PD on career outcomes was influenced by a combination of personal, organisational and policy context factors \[ **R3**\]. 

####  Improving Capacity for Leadership of Professional Development 

 Boylan et al identified ways that the leadership of professional development is important to effective PD, including factors that facilitate and develop such leadership. Boylan's review of policy\-orientated evaluations identified the importance of PD leadership to the success of national government policy innovations \[ **R4**\]. Based on analysis of leadership in professional development programmes, and specifically those of the National Centre for the Teaching of Mathematics, the research identified that PD leadership involves being an advocate, mobiliser and champion for PD \- to broker and instigate greater access to PD for teachers \[ **R5**\]. Extending this, Perry and Boylan identified ways that effective PD leadership can be supported through a framework of skills, knowledge and capabilities. This informed research\-based programmes to support PD leaders \[ **R6**\]. Boylan et al reconceptualised analytical models of PD as tools to inform design, implementation and local evaluation of PD \- leading to guidance which supports PD leaders in the selection of analytical models for designing, delivering and evaluating PD \[ **R7**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The professional development of teachers is key to improving pupils’ educational outcomes, by enhancing teaching quality, teacher wellbeing and increasing teacher retention. Sheffield Hallam research improved professional development by shaping national education policy and developing practice. 

####  Shaping National Educational Policy 

 Through the engagement of Boylan, Coldwell, Maxwell and Perry in the policy arena, such as the DfE’s PD expert group \[ **E1**, **E2**\], and Twiselton’s \(Director of Sheffield Institute of Education\) membership of a number of major policy development groups, findings from teacher PD research have **influenced national educational policy**, including evidencing the links between PD and teacher retention \[ **R1**, **R3**\] and the importance of improving PD leadership \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. These findings were **adopted in DfE policy documents** \[ **E3**\], influencing the development of the DfE’s Early Career Framework \(ECF\) for **all new teachers in England**, and a new professional qualification \- the Leading Teacher Development Specialist National Professional Qualification \(NPQ\). The DfE’s Director of Teacher Workforce has confirmed that: **""**Sheffield Hallam University's research has **helped develop, in current policy, a very clear relationship between retention and early career support and development**. This is seen by the clear pathway now being implemented from ITE to ECF to specialist NPQs to senior and executive leadership*"" \[ **E1**\]. 

 The suite of research and evaluation carried out by Boylan and others has influenced DfE funding for PD initiatives. For example, the findings of the Mathematics Teacher Exchange \[ **R4**\] **""played a significant role in shaping the policy development**"" of the DfE’s mathematics teacher PD policy \[ **E4**\]. This included **£41million investment**, part of which funded the establishment of Primary Mastery specialist PD. This programme has trained 800 PD leaders, who are now **supporting teachers in approximately 40% of primary schools in England** \[ **E4**\]. 

####  Wider Influence on Professional Development Policy and Practice 

 In addition to DfE policy, the research has **shaped national third sector organisations’ policy and provision** through funded partnership activity, presentations to advisory and practitioner groups, and support for policy development. Findings from **R5** and **R6** have *“significantly contributed to the research evidence on teachers’ professional development in the UK*” and have informed the Wellcome Trust's policy engagement with government including *""dialogue with CPD Policy Leads at the Department for Education, roundtable events with a broad range of subject associations and sector organisations both within and beyond science, presentations at conferences and at an All\-Party Parliamentary Group, and discussion with the Minister for School Standards""* \[ **E5**\]. 

 The research has **influenced policy and PD provision** by the Institute of Physics \(IoP\), including an online tool, based on **R6**, designed to support PD leaders \(coaches\) who are responsible for the IoP’s PD programme. According to the Teacher Recruitment and Retention Manager, *“\[Perry\] and colleagues’ inputs into IOP’s activities have influenced our policies around teacher professional development and the practices we use to support IOP coaches and other professional development leaders who deliver this work”* \[ **E6**\]. Similarly, the research has influenced the Teacher Development Trust’s **policy and PD practice,** including a PD programme \- Leading Lesson Study \- delivered jointly by TDT and SHU, with 70 teachers participating. 

 The CEO of the Teacher Development Trust confirmed that as a result, "" *TDT’s policy has moved from a general aim to improve the quality of teacher professional development, to its current greater focus on the importance of the leadership of professional developmen*t"" \[ **E2**\]. 

####  Benefits for Professional Development Leaders, Schools and Teachers 

 During the assessment period, with Perry as Head of Knowledge Exchange, approximately £2,000,000 of external funding was secured to undertake more than 30 PD\-focused knowledge exchange projects, often collaboratively, underpinned by the research. Examples include: 

-  The 2018\-20 Wellcome CPD Challenge Champions programme, which was underpinned by R5\-7. This two\-year programme of support and training was delivered to 60 PD leaders from 40 primary, secondary and special schools. The Professional Development Programme Lead at Wellcome Trust acknowledged that "" *the support for CPD leaders was designed through application of Emily Perry and Mark Boylan’s research into professional development leadership*"" \[ **E5**\]. The programme led to **improvements in over 1500 teachers’ PD**, increasing the average annual amount of PD teachers engaged in from 39 to 52 hours in the first year, representing an additional 19,500 hours of PD. 62% of teachers reported improvements in their knowledge surrounding pedagogy, and 50% that learning from PD had demonstrably **improved their teaching practice** \[ **E7**\]. One PD leader emphasised how *""the theory behind the approaches to CPD was incredibly useful for identifying next steps and needs of staff""* \[ **E6**\]. 

-  The Wipro Teacher Fellows and Mentors’ programme, funded by Wipro Ltd, was designed through application of **R1**\- **R2** and **R5**\- **R7**. The programme provided PD for early career teachers of STEM subjects, including mentoring by other teachers and a development programme for these mentors. Between 2018\-20, 26 teacher mentors participated in PD, supporting 30 early career teachers, leading to **positive impacts on their mentoring and PD leadership practice** within the programme and in their schools. One Wipro Mentors’ programme participant reflected that, *“\[As a result of\] looking at the latest research materials and being presented with the latest research… I have as a consequence drastically **reformed our CPD programme for all of our NQTs**”* \[ **E8**\]. 

-  Support for teachers in Ghana to lead science teacher PD, in a programme funded by the Ghanaian Ministry of Education, was informed by findings from **R2** and **R5**\- **R7**. Through co\-development and delivery of PD, the new PD leaders **improved their skills, knowledge and capabilities in PD leadership**. Developing a team of local PD leaders, rather than relying on overseas expertise, represented a significant change in the local context with the programme **reaching all 180 senior high schools in the country and enabling 1500 teachers to benefit** from enhanced PD \[ **E9**\]. 

-  A regional PD programme for 50 PD leaders in the Science Learning Network, funded by STEM Learning Ltd, was developed from the findings of R6 to improve PD leaders’ capabilities, knowledge and skills for leading PD. Between 2013\-16, these PD leaders **developed and delivered PD for approximately 6000 teachers, with consistently positive impact measures,** such as over 90% positive impact on teachers’ knowledge, skills and practice and over 80% positive impact on pupil outcomes \[ **E10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 By putting public engagement at the heart of our deep\-sea research, we have delivered benefits to society by generating inspiration and curiosity about science, raising awareness of our research insights and their context, and providing cultural enrichment by supporting lifelong learning. We achieved these impact goals through a programme of activities including: 

-  working with broadcast documentary makers to feature findings from our research\(e.g. underpinning research included in BBC *Blue Planet II*, now reaching \~1 billion worldwide\); 

-  creating and delivering an interactive online programme to engage people with our research\(e.g. a Massive Open Online Course with >52,000 enrolments from people in 183 countries\); 

-  producing a popular science book highlighting our recent discoveries and delivering a related series of >70 in\-person engagement events nationwide \(to total audiences of >94,000 people\); 

-  providing specific input to briefings and reports for UK policymakers, directly informing legislative recommendations for deep\-sea mining with results from our research. 

 This overall programme of engagement with our research has raised wider awareness of the diversity of habitats and life in the deep ocean, the impacts of human activities on deep\-sea environments, the potential of resources in the deep ocean, and the choices from personal to policy level that will determine its future. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Deep ocean environments, defined as depths greater than 200 metres, cover more than 65 per cent of the surface of our planet and are under increasing pressure from human activities, such as the exploitation of their resources and the disposal of our waste. Our underpinning research explores the biodiversity and ecology of deep\-sea environments, including their vulnerability to future activities such as deep\-sea mining, supported by several NERC grants since 2008. 

 This programme of research has involved expeditions with UK research ships, including two led by Copley as Principal Scientist, using NERC's deep\-diving Remotely Operated Vehicle. The multidisciplinary approach of the Southampton team, working with other UK and international partners, synthesises biological, geochemical, and geological data to provide a full environmental context for interpreting ecological patterns in deep\-sea habitats. This has resulted in the following discoveries that underpin this Impact Case Study \(research outputs \[ **3.1** to **3.6**\] listed Section 3\): 

-  the discovery and ecology of hydrothermal vents on the Mid\-Cayman Spreading Centre of the Caribbean Sea \[ **3.1**\], and the adaptations of a new shrimp species dominating those vents \[ **3.2**\]; 

-  the discovery and ecology of ""black smoker"" hydrothermal vents in the Southern Ocean \[ **3.3**\],and the adaptations of a new crab species \(the ""Hoff"" crab\) that is abundant at those vents \[ **3.4**\]; 

-  the discovery of six previously undescribed species at hydrothermal vents on the Southwest Indian Ridge \[ **3.5**\], and the adaptations of the abundant ""scaly\-foot snail"" from those vents \[ **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The overall relationship between our underpinning research outputs and key impact\-generating activities in each area of engagement was as follows: 



 Details of activities and impacts for each area \( **4.1** to **4.4**\) are presented below. Evidence for **reach** is provided by information about audiences for our activities. **Significance** is demonstrated by: 

-  results from evaluations incorporated in activities to assess achievement of engagement goals; 

-  recognition of our engagement activities in international awards; 

-  newspaper & magazine reviews of popular science book featuring our underpinning research; 

-  testimonials from media professionals \(e.g. BBC Natural History Unit\) with whom we worked; 

-  evidence such as audience feedback, using principles from our previous experience \[ **5.11**\]. 

 **\(4.1\) Documentaries and broadcasts:** We worked with BBC producers to feature results from our research in documentary series broadcast since 2014 \[ **5.1**\]. For example, results and deep\-sea footage from our investigation of Southern Ocean hydrothermal vents and the reproductive ecology of the ""Hoff"" crab \(underpinning outputs \[ **3.3**\+ **3.4**\]\) featured in *Atlantic: The Wildest Ocean on Earth*, shown on BBC Two on 06 August 2015 and reaching 2.1 million viewers on first broadcast, subsequently broadcast as *Wild Atlantic* across Europe, internationally on BBC Earth, and released on DVD, iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime, Netflix. 

 *Blue Planet II* \(episode 2: *The Deep*; first broadcast 05 November 2017\) featured footage and results from the same underpinning research \[ **3.3\+3.4**\]; for reach of impact, that episode was the 2<sup>nd</sup> most\-viewed TV programme of 2017 in the UK, watched by 13.97 million people for its first transmission, subsequently broadcast in >30 other countries \(including 80 million viewers in China\), and released on DVD, iTunes, Google Play, and Netflix, with an overall global reach now estimated to approach one billion people \[ **5.2**\]. The content that we provided was also specifically highlighted by the BBC in pre\-publicity for the series, receiving widespread press coverage \[ **S1**\], indicating significance of impact from engaging the producers of the series with our research. 

 Testimonials from the producers with whom we worked \[ **5.2**\+ **5.3**\] provide evidence for significance of impact from our engagement with the BBC Natural History Unit, such as: *""we were able to shine a light on the newly discovered Hoff Crab and the new world of the South Sandwich Island hydrothermal vents… and to remind our audience of up to a billion people around the world just how little we still know about the deep...* *to do so in collaboration with Dr Copley, who is a gifted communicator as well as a scientist, meant our ability to raise awareness of fragile ocean ecosystems had as great an impact as possible""* \(\[ **5.2**\]; *Blue Planet II* producer Orla Doherty\) and *""Our story was based on research observations documenting the extreme lengths the female Hoff crab goes to, in order to protect her eggs… It is precisely this type of 'character\-led' drama that draws new audiences to TV documentaries that feature the natural world… Incorporation of such footage dramatically lifted the aspirations of the series, since a public service broadcaster couldn't possibly film these environments""* \(\[ **5.3**\]; *Atlantic* producer Ted Giffords\). Our interaction with these media professionals also taught us how to shoot deep\-sea footage during our research to meet the specific needs of documentary makers \[ **S3**\], building our capability to bring our work to wider audiences through that medium for our engagement goals. 

 In addition to TV series, we worked with radio documentary makers to feature results from our research on biodiversity at Indian Ocean hydrothermal vents \(underpinning outputs \[ **3.5**\+ **3.6**\]\) in *The Compass: Ocean Stories*, broadcast in November 2017 on BBC World Service, which has a global reach of 75 million \[ **3.1**\], though it is not possible to track total audience across countries for a specific programme. Our research investigating hydrothermal vent environments and their biodiversity in the Cayman Trough \(outputs \[ **3.1**\+ **3.2**\]\) provided content for *Into The Abyss* on BBC Radio 4 \(July 2014\), which highlighted the issue of deep\-sea mining and its potential environmental impacts.  We also worked with an independent film\-maker to produce a short film, *Hydrothermal Vents: What Does The Future Hold?*, about our Cayman Trough research and the context of deep\-sea mining, which was shortlisted as a finalist in the Emerging Film\-maker category at the international *Blue Ocean Film Festival* in 2014 \[ **3.1**\]. 

 **\(4.2\) Online engagement:** We created a ""Massive Open Online Course"" \(MOOC\) about *Exploring Our Ocean* to introduce people with no prior scientific background to the exploration of deep\-sea environments and their biodiversity. Our online programme was designed for public engagement with our work, and included data and results from our research at Cayman Trough hydrothermal vents \[ **3.1**\+ **3.2**\]. The programme ran ""live"" over several weeks each year from 2014 through 2020 \(a total of 14 runs\), with PhD students answering questions in discussion forums as participants explored topics through course videos \(including footage from our underpinning research\), simple data interpretation \(including data from our underpinning research\), and reading \(including news media coverage of our research\). 

 Since its first run in 2014, the *Exploring Our Oceans* MOOC has had >52,000 enrolments from people in 183 countries, posting >41,000 online comments and questions \[ **5.5**\]. To evaluate significance of impact for the MOOC, we included ""before and after"" questions to capture changes in participants' awareness of deep\-sea environments and their biodiversity, and to assess other outcomes for our engagement goals of ""providing cultural enrichment by supporting lifelong learning"" and ""raising awareness of our research insights and their context"". Examples of participant feedback \[ **5.4**\] consistent with achieving those goals include *""Might sound odd but this has changed my life and inspired me beyond anything before and I'm nudging 50\!""* and *""Basically my point of view has changed. Instead of marvelling at how wonderful the deep\-sea creatures are, I came to realize it is necessary that we must do our utmost to protect them"".* 

 In addition, an HEA\-funded study of the impact of our MOOC \[ **5.4**\] conducted detailed follow\-up interviews with 453 participants from the initial run of *Exploring Our Oceans*, providing further evidence for significance of impacts consistent with our engagement goals: 100% of those interviewed *""learned about the results of current research""* during the MOOC, and 97% *""learned something that changed the way I view an issue""*. We also assessed the impact of the MOOC on the ""ocean literacy"" of participants, publishing our results and sharing our experience in a peer\-reviewed paper \[ **5.5**\], and our MOOC was Highly Commended in the Projects category of *The Ocean Awards 2016*, sponsored by the Blue Marine Foundation and Boat International Media to recognise impact in engagement with the ocean \[ **5.4**\]. 

 For online engagement in 2020 we also worked with the producers and presenters of *Let's Go Live\!*, a YouTube series for those home\-schooling children during Covid\-19 lockdown, bringing our findings about the ecology of hydrothermal vent shrimp \[ **3.2**\] to >5,000 households during the live show and subsequently reaching >25,000 online views in total \[ **5.6**\]. Underpinning research \[ **3.5**\+ **3.6**\] featured in the *Guardian* Science Weekly podcast in January 2020, distributed via platforms including Apple, Google, Spotify and SoundCloud, preventing tracking of total audiences but with listener feedback including comments such as *""science communication at its best""* \[ **5.1**\]. In November 2020, underpinning research \[ **3.3**\] featured in the *BBC Science Focus* podcast series *Everything you ever wanted to know about… the deep sea with Dr Jon Copley*, distributed internationally via platforms including Acast, iTunes, Stitcher, and Overcast \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **\(4.3\) In\-person engagement and ""popular science"" book:** In total, we delivered >50 in\-person engagement events about our underpinning research to a total audience of >86,000 people during the REF period, and worked with a professional event producer and presenter who featured our research in 22 further events to an additional audience of \~8,600 people. Our in\-person programme targeted four specific communities of place and interest: \(1\) local communities in the southern UK where we are based; \(2\) school pupils and their families and teachers; \(3\) lifelong learners; and \(4\) users of the marine environment \(recreational & professional\). A full list of the events that we delivered ourselves, with audience information and feedback, is provided in \[ **5.7**\]. 

 In 2015 Copley won a NERC ""Summer Of Science"" grant for public engagement, which we used to deliver a session of talks at the annual British Science Festival and create exhibits for the Southampton Boat Show, ""Science Uncovered"" at the Natural History Museum, and NERC's "" *RRS Discovery* in London"" programme, featuring all our underpinning research. The 2015 events reached >28,000 people in total, and we evaluated impact using audience questionnaires for our talks and a touch\-screen system for our exhibits, with results \[ **5.8**\] providing evidence of raising awareness of deep\-sea environments and their biodiversity, such as 84% of those polled not being previously aware that UK Overseas Territories include habitats such as hydrothermal vents. 

 Our subsequent in\-person programme from 2016 to 2018 included major events such as the Bluedot Festival in 2016 and 2018 \(audience \~1,200 people\); *New Scientist Live* Main Stage 2018 \(\~3,000 people\); ""R3A at the Royal Institution"" 2017 \(\~300 lifelong learners\); and keynote talks at European Maritime Day 2017 \(\~800 professional users of the marine environment\) and the Royal Society of Biology Education Awards 2018 \(\~300 school pupils & teachers\). 

 In addition, our research on Southern Ocean hydrothermal vents and the ecology of the ""Hoff"" crab \[ **3.3**\+ **3.4**\] featured in 22 ""Deep Ocean Lab"" school & family festival engagement events delivered by science presenter Greg Foot during 2017 to 2020 to a total audience of 8,600 school pupils, their family members, and teachers \[ **5.6**\]. His testimonial highlights the significance of impact from incorporating material from our underpinning research: *""Both the deep\-sea vent  footage, and showing the actual physical Crab to the audience \(albeit in perspex\), brought the scientific adventure and research to life… lots of follow up questions showing significant engagement and passion for ocean science""*. 

 Dialogue with audiences at our events from August 2013 through 2018 informed the content and format for the ""popular science"" book *Ask an Ocean Explorer,* written by Copley and published by Hodder & Stoughton in 2019, featuring results from all our underpinning research and sharing our research process. The book received positive reviews in newspapers and magazines \[ **5.9**\], with comments demonstrating our goal of raising awareness of deep\-sea environments and their biodiversity, such as: "" *deftly conjures the wonders of a bathynaut's world""* \( *Nature*\); *""an engaging book sprinkled with mind\-blowing facts about the deep ocean""* \( *Daily Express*\); *""a new informed perspective on the wide, watery world we inhabit""* \( *Coast* magazine Book Of The Month, May 2019\). UK paperback sales averaged \~160 per week by the end of 2019 \[ **5.9**\]. 

 Publication of the book led to a 20\-date *Ask an Ocean Explorer* national tour of talks delivered by Copley in 2019 to engage people with our underpinning research, supported by the publisher whose testimonial records *""unprecedented demand""* from literary festivals and that audiences were *""animated, better informed, and brimming with discussion on leaving his talks, resulting in great book sales""* \[ **5.9**\]. Examples of feedback from event organisers and audience members \[ **5.7**\] indicating achievement of our engagement goals included: *""wonderful talk on the creatures of the deep and our impact on the oceans… best questions ever from the youngsters in the audience""* and *""an amazing and inspiring talk about deep sea life and biodiversity""*. 

 Beyond the *Ask an Ocean Explorer* tour, our programme of other in\-person engagement events for 2019\-2020 included Gresham College, the UK’s oldest public lecture series \(live audience of >300 lifelong learners and >2,800 viewers online \[ **5.7**\]\) and the *Monsters Of The Deep* exhibition at the National Maritime Museum in Falmouth \(37,276 visitors July\-December 2020 \[ **5.7**\]\), for which Copley was a guest curator, creating a display featuring our underpinning research on Southern Ocean hydrothermal vents and the ""Hoff"" crab \[ **3.3**\+ **3.4**\]. 

 **\(4.4\) Policymaker engagement:** Our goal of raising awareness of deep\-sea environments and their biodiversity included engaging policymakers with results from our underpinning research, by contributing to briefings and reports on the topic of deep\-sea resources \[ **5.10**\], after Copley was selected for the Royal Society’s Parliamentary Pairing Scheme in 2014. Results from our research on biodiversity at Indian Ocean hydrothermal vents \[ **3.5**\+ **3.6**\] were described in the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology \(POST\) Briefing Note on Deep\-sea Mining \(2015\). The Royal Society's *Future Ocean Resources* report in 2017 for the Government Office for Science \(GO Science\), for which Mills was a Working Group Member, specifically cited \[ **3.5**\] and was distributed to parliamentarians, government departments, and NGOs. Copley was also invited to present findings from this underpinning research \[ **3.5**\+ **3.6**\] to the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee in 2018, and to write an article about those results for *Science In Parliament* \(Autumn 2018 issue\), published by the Committee to \~600 parliamentarians and civil servants. 

 We highlighted results from our research at Indian Ocean hydrothermal vents \[ **3.5**\] in written evidence from Copley to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee \(EAC\) inquiry on Sustainable Seas in 2018, to which Mills was also invited to submit oral evidence. A key result from that underpinning research was described in the Committee's final report to government \(page 32 of the report \[ **5.10**\]\) and mentioned specifically in discussion of the report in the House of Commons chamber on 17 January 2019 \(Hansard, vol 652 col 1358 \[ **5.10**\]\), informing a UK policy recommendation for a moratorium on mining active hydrothermal vents. In December 2020, Copley was the UK's invited participant in the UN International Seabed Authority workshop developing an international framework for environmental management of mid\-ocean ridge ecosystems.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by the University of Aberdeen has shaped a social practices approach to adult literacies in Rwanda, combining expertise in adult literacies education with an in\-depth knowledge of Rwandan everyday social practices. The research has led to the development of Rwanda’s first\-ever qualification aimed at adult educators, which, in turn, has enhanced the knowledge and skills of adult literacy practitioners, increased adult literacy levels and improved the quality of life for both tutors and learners. The work has also provided a valuable evidence base to inform government policy on adult education in Rwanda. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In a country where only a third of adults have completed primary school, and nearly a third cannot read or write a short note \[6\], delivery of adult literacy classes depends heavily on untrained community tutors, many of whom have only completed primary school\-level education themselves. The government also relies on non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) to provide literacy classes.  Literacy centres in Rwanda are generally in churches, although some literacy classes are held in the open; these literacy centres are poorly equipped, with few learning resources and many do not even have a chalk board. As a result, few adult literacy learners develop skills that they can use in their daily lives including skills that would enable them to improve their quality of life, such as greater autonomy and problem\-solving skills \[6\]. Without literacy skills, individuals cannot get paid non\-farm employment and rely on day farm labouring or subsistence farming to make a livelihood and are denied opportunities to be local leaders, cannot help their children with schoolwork and often feel marginalised within their communities. 

 The University of Rwanda is the only public university that provides a pre\-service degree for training tutors for the 13 teacher training colleges. Districts are responsible for coordinating adult literacy tutors' training and the delivery of literacy classes with NGOs, religious institutions, and other development partners running literacy classes. The Rwandan National Adult Education Strategic Plan, designed as a tool for planning, coordination and monitoring the implementation of the Adult Education Policy \(2014\), has never been prioritised \[6\]. 

 **Curriculum design & pedagogy** 

 Professor Ackland has examined the relationships between theory, policy and practice in a period of reform in adult education in Scotland on adopting the ‘Social Practices Approach’ \(SPA\) \[1, 2\]. The research \[2\] has illuminated the complexities of education reform and the challenges of transforming educational practices congruent with radical theory. The social practices approach is primarily a theory of literacies in society that emphasises inherent power relationships that influence the uses of literacies in social contexts, and the situated nature of literacies acquisition. It requires an educational approach that draws on learners’ interests and supports them to participate in the literacies practises that have meaning and value in their everyday lives. 

 Ackland’s research showed the importance of challenging adult educators’ understandings of literacy to enable them to transform their learning strategies and enable learners to participate in literacies practices that learners identify as being important for them. The research into the Scottish experience underpinned an approach to the professional development of adult literacies teacher educators, tutors and volunteers in Rwanda, which recognised the significance of local context, the barriers to change, the necessity of re\-conceptualisations of practice and the collaborative methods required to affect transformation. 

 **Understanding the Rwandan context** 

 Research carried out by Professor Pamela Abbott, Director of the Centre for Global Development, School of Education, has provided a detailed understanding of everyday social practices in Rwanda – how people – including the poorest and most deprived – live their daily lives \[3\-5\]. Abbott’s body of work is comprised of a series of studies into lifestyles and living conditions in Rwanda carried out in collaboration with Rwandan colleagues \(including Roger Mugisha, Co\-PI\) from the Institute of Policy Analysis and Research\-Rwanda \(IPAR\-Rwanda, the leading think\-tank in Rwanda\). 

 **Adult literacies in the Western Province \(2018\-current\)** 

 Combining these bodies of research has enabled the team of Aberdeen researchers \(Ackland, Abbott and Mtika\) to leverage funding worth nearly GBP1,200,000 from the Scottish Government to undertake a programme of applied research titled ‘Fostering a social practice approach to adult literacies for improving people's quality of life in Western Rwanda’ \[P1\]. Western Province, the focus of Aberdeen research, is the poorest province in Rwanda, with 69% of the population living in poverty and 88% of the population living in rural areas. 

 This project is the first of its kind in Rwanda, brings together a collaboration with the University of Rwanda and the Institute of Policy Analysis and Research \(IPAR\-Rwanda\), using a mixed\-methods approach to answer ‘what’, ‘why’’ and how’ questions about the adult literacy education provision available in the Western province. The Rwandan lead, Associate Professor Wenceslas Nzabalirwa \(IPAR\-Rwanda\), working closely with the Aberdeen team, is responsible for the implementation of the project by TTCs of Rubengera, Gacuba II and Mururu. The project objectives included; the validation of a Professional Diploma in SPA at the University of Rwanda; and the training of BEd students and tutors in TTCs qualifying them to train adult literacy tutors to use a SPA. As part of the project, an initial scoping study was undertaken by the Aberdeen team, \[6\] as well as a review of the 2014 Adult Education Policy \(undertaken by Abbott\). Based on interviews with regional and district stakeholders including six of the seven District Directors of Education in Western Province and Professionals in Charge of Adult Education, the Director of Planning in the Ministry of Education, the Deputy Director of the Rwanda Education Board, and representatives of NGOs delivering literacy classes \[6\], the team concluded that: 

-  The University of Rwanda and TTCs required support to build capacity to train the trainers, and train adult literacy tutors as set out in the 2014 Adult Education Policy and its strategic plan; 

-  A ‘hybrid’ rather than a ‘purer’ SPA approach  was required to ensure that students cover the Rwanda Adult Education Literacy syllabus; 

-  To ensure sustainability, a cost\-efficient model of training community literacy tutors, using an apprenticeship model and utilising cheap, locally available learning materials, needs to be put in place.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The ‘Fostering a Social Practice Approach to Adult Literacies’ project and building on established relationships within Rwanda, has enabled the University of Rwanda and TTCs to implement the guidance from the research and contributed to the Rwandan government’s mission to improve adult literacy levels and enhance wellbeing in the country. Specifically, Aberdeen’s collaborative work with the University of Rwanda and IPAR has introduced a new qualification for adult educators and has enhanced the knowledge and skills of adult literacy practitioners in Rwanda. Furthermore, the work has increased adult literacy levels, improved the quality of life of adult learners, and provided an evidence base to guide implementation of Rwandan government policy towards the sustainable delivery of adult basic education. 

 **Introducing a new Professional Diploma qualification for adult educators in Rwanda** 

 The Aberdeen research applying the social practices approach to adult literacy training in Rwanda has guided implementation of 2014 Adult Education policy and led to the country’s first\-ever qualification aimed at adult educators, validated and delivered by the University of Rwanda \[S1\]. Abbott, Ackland and Mtika built capacity in SPA at the University of Rwanda by training five established academic staff members in the approach enabling the University to provide pre\-service and in\-service teacher training both in delivering adult literacy classes and in training community literacies tutors, who are untrained ‘volunteers’ \[S1i\]. 

 The Aberdeen team adopted an apprenticeship model based on initial scoping interviews with key stakeholders and has continued to provide professional guidance, including tutor training materials \[S1ii\] enabling the team at the University of Rwanda to develop and validate a professional postgraduate diploma, in order to deliver a ‘train the trainer’, model. The diploma was validated by the University of Rwanda Senate and is now an approved element of the Rwanda National Qualifications Framework for Higher Education \(RNQFHE\) \[S1iii\]. In order to support its embedding and implementation, two members of staff are now registered with the University of Aberdeen, studying for PhDs to enable the College to support the Rwandan Government in implementing the 2014 Adult Education Policy. Mayors from all districts have acknowledged the benefit of the project, with the Major of Rubavu District, in particular, expressing appreciation, stating that in Rubavu: 

 *The project has trained five community literacy tutors and 159 students in 2018\-2019, 18 community literacies tutors and 343 students in 2019\-2020, not to forget 20 community literacies tutors and 578 students recruited for 2020\-2021. \(The project\) has tremendously supported the district in achieving its target by training not only adult learners but also the district professional in charge of adult education* \[S2i\]. 

 Similarly, the Mayor of Rusizi District confirmed that the project has introduced an approach that is helping the community to improve their quality of life while at the same time acquiring skills of reading, writing and numeracy \[S2ii\]. 

 **Enhancing the Knowledge and Skills of Adult Literacy Practitioners** 

 The SPA model has enhanced the knowledge and skills of tutors working within TTCs and community literacies tutors. Tutors from the Gacuba II Teacher Training College have described the training as improving their competencies, enhancing respect and recognition from society, especially adult literacies learners, and helping them to contribute to the development of education more generally in Rwanda \[S3\]. Based on these enhanced skills, the apprenticeship ‘train the trainer’ model, enabling those who have completed the postgraduate diploma to train community literacies tutors \(volunteers\), has been successfully rolled out to teacher training colleges in Western province. The model has been adopted by the Association Rwandaise des Travailleurs Chrétiens Féminine \(ARTCF Rwanda\), a local NGO that, as part of its work, delivers adult literacy classes in Southern, Western and Northern Provinces. In 2019 ARTCF successfully applied for funding \(GBP13,634\) to implement the model. By December 2020, 215 community tutors had been trained \[S4, S5, S6\]. 

 The community tutors have also confirmed the efficacy of the new approach. In interviews carried out as part of the regular project evaluations, tutors have described the approach as ‘much better’ than previous methods that ‘did not work very well’ because it supports adult learners to ‘discuss their problems and come up with ideas as to how they can help themselves to overcome them’. Munyantore Peter, a community tutor at the Kabahire Adult Learning Centre, has described the benefits, both to himself and to his learners, in detail: 

 *I thought that the training that the project was going to give me would mean that I would have more knowledge about teaching adult literacy and more skills in teaching and that this would make me a better teacher. However, apart from enabling me to improve my skills in teaching, reading, writing and numeracy, it has helped me to enable \[my students\] to understand how they can improve their daily lives* \[S3\]. 

 **Increasing Literacies Levels Among Adults** 

 This model, underpinned by the Aberdeen research, has meant that by December 2020, 6,190 learners had graduated from a programme using the SPA taught by a trained tutor and a further 6,132 were awaiting examination \[S7\]. The overall student satisfaction for the courses taught by tutors in teacher training colleges was over 90%. Adult learners say they have gained basic knowledge \(writing, reading, counting and ICT\) in a short time, learned how to collaborate and cooperate with others and feel more trusted by their communities. Aberdeen research has also raised awareness in national media of the importance of building critical infrastructure to ensure that adults have basic literacy capabilities \[S8\]. 

 **Improving the quality of life of community tutors and adult learners** 

 Community tutors and adult learners have not only benefitted from the programme by gaining skills that they can use in their everyday lives, but their feedback also points to improvements in their quality of life. Besides reading, writing and counting, learners and community tutors point to improved knowledge and skills of planning and cooking a balanced diet, strategies to prevent HIV/ AIDS, family planning strategies, health management and sanitation, environmental protection and crop management, and financial management. Many tutors and learners are accessing financial support \[S3\] to help them grow their food to improve their family diet and start income\-generating projects. Community tutor Nyiraguhirwa Agathe has described how her students, 

 *Share their ideas and discuss together under my guidance and come to decisions about what their main problems are. Then they discuss what they can do. They have decided to have a mutual fund \(savings club\) and to use the money they saved to purchase pigs and rabbits to rear, and to buy seeds so they can have kitchen gardens and give their families a balanced diet* \[S3\]. 

 **Providing an evidence\-base to inform Rwandan government policy** 

 The Aberdeen research has influenced national \(Ministry of Education, Rwanda Education Board\) policy, and in turn informed approaches for implementation of adult basic education in three districts \(Karongi, Rabavu, Rusziz\) by demonstrating the importance of having trained tutors and of using a pedagogy that engages learners and gives them skills that they can use in their everyday lives. The Rwandan lead for the project, Associate Professor Wenceslas, was invited by the Rwandan Education Board to provide advice on educating adults through a four\-week group workshop in October 2020 \[S9i\]. Acting Director\-General, Rwanda Education Board confirmed that this contribution enabled the development of adult education syllabi for levels 2 and 3 and that his involvement enabled ‘ *participants to adapt and embed the SPA in the Adult Education Curriculum’* \[S9ii\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The law assumes that only human inventions are patentable. It seems, therefore, that AI\-generated inventions can be denied patent protection. Abbott’s research has had legal, regulatory, industrial, and societal impacts in exposing this gap in the protection of innovation, and in identifying the optimal ways to fill it. Notably, the first patent applications for AI\-generated inventions have become a reality because of his academic work. The ensuing test\-cases have resulted in policies formed in the UK, EU, and US, and laws being changed. His academic work influences government/industry/patent offices’ approaches to AI invention and, via leading media, routinely affects critical debate among public audiences and industry stakeholders.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Background**:  Across jurisdictions, patents can be granted only if an ‘inventor’ is named in the application. If the correct view is that this ‘inventor’ must be human a significant problem for industry arises: whereas a company can apply for and hold patents for inventions created by humans \(e.g., its employees\), no such protection is available for its AI\-generated inventions. Abbott’s research is among the first to scrutinise this problem. The associated outputs, produced from 2016\-present, are sole\-authored, and appear across a range of outlets, including leading university presses and law reviews \(e.g., MIT, CUP, and UCLA Law Review\) and internationally significant professional and industry publications \(e.g., Landslide, Mitteilungen, Intellectual Property Watch\). While scholarship in intellectual property law is often characterised by sophisticated doctrinal analysis, Abbott also exposes the complex issues to rigorous theoretical scrutiny, bringing his findings to bear on the very practical regulatory domain of patent law. His work crosses disciplines, adapting methods and incorporating insights from the fields of AI, medicine, law, and philosophy. 

 **Key Research Insights:**  Rapid technological development has allowed AI\-generated invention to proliferate. The question, whether and how to protect innovation where a natural person does not qualify as an inventor, has thus become increasingly pressing. Abbott argues that, even under current patent law, AI should qualify as an inventor when it does the work of an inventor, and that the AI’s owner \(a company or individual\) should be able to apply for and hold the patent. He identifies a number of economic, societal, legal, and individual justifications for this approach, including: \(a\)  incentivising the use and development of inventive machines ultimately to facilitate innovation; \(b\) promoting the disclosure of inventive AI output that might otherwise be protected as confidential information; \(c\) advancing the commercialisation of new technologies such as AI\-designed pharmaceutical drugs; \(d\) preserving the integrity of ‘human inventorship’ which may be undermined if people claim credit for work they have not performed \(e.g., an AI\-generated invention\). 

 **Outline of Underpinning Research:**  Abbott’s first work on AI\-generated invention analyses AI inventorship and Big Data in a book chapter with MIT Press **\[R1\].** The Boston College Law Review article that follows considers the specific implications for patent law of AI inventorship **\[R2\].** Abbott’s book chapter, pre\-published in 2017 by Edward Elgar, discusses how to protect computer\-generated works in the UK specifically **\[R3\]**. A second journal article \(UCLA Law Review\) explores how patent law standards must be adapted to the widespread use of inventive machines **\[R4\].** Abbott has several smaller articles on this subject, including in WIPO Magazine **\[R5\]** \(officially translated into eight languages\) and in Popular Science Arabia \(in Arabic\). His academic work is crystalised in the CUP monograph \-\- The Reasonable Robot: Artificial Intelligence and the Law *\-\-* which addresses AI law generally with substantial portions dedicated to AI\-generated inventions **\[R6\]**. Abbott has disseminated his research at a substantial number of conferences, including at Oxford, Cambridge, King’s College London, Stanford, and MIT.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

####  1. The first AI\-generated patent applications \(industry beneficiaries\) 

 Based on Abbott’s publications, an international legal team submitted the first two patent applications for AI\-generated inventions. An AI machine, ‘DABUS,’ was responsible for both, one consisting of a flashing light that uniquely draws the eye in emergency situations, the other a container \(to hold beverages for example\) with a profile of pits and bulges that enables multiple containers to be coupled, while also improving grip and heat transfer. These applications directly advocate for legal positions advanced by Abbott’s published works and his research is identified as a driving force behind the filings **\[S1, S2\].** The two patent applications are pending consideration or are under appeal in the UK, European Patent Office, US, Canada, Australia, Germany, Israel, Taiwan, China, Korea, India, and Japan. 

####  2. Policy developments and case\-law \(regulatory, and industrial benefits internationally\) 

 Abbott’s research and direct contribution to the applications has \(a\) caused regulatory bodies to produce clear policies determining that AI\-generated inventions are not currently patentable; \(b\) enabled these bodies to identify the need for new laws and policies to reflect the reality of AI\-generated invention; \(c\) led to judicial appeals across jurisdictions, and \(d\) prompted international action and co\-operation in the area. 

1.  The UK Intellectual Property Office \(UKIPO\) and the European Patent Office \(EPO\) agreed that DABUS’s inventions were sufficiently unique to be patented but both denied the applications, on the basis that only natural persons can be inventors. As a result, the law in the field is now that AI\-inventions are not patentable, unless the decisions are overturned **\[S3, S4\].** These new legal rulings help provide certainty to businesses struggling to determine how to protect the results of AI\-based innovation. Siemens, for example, reported in 2019 that they had instances of AI\-generated inventions and have not been able to apply for patent protection because they could not identify a human inventor. \(See, **\[R6\]** above, p.10\) 

1.  In rejecting the applications, a UKIPO official took the unusual step of noting the importance of this topic and the need for change that arises: “As the applicant says, inventions created by AI machines are likely to become more prevalent in future and there is a legitimate question as to how or whether the patent system should handle such inventions. I have found that the present system does not cater for such inventions and it was never anticipated that it would, but times have changed and technology has moved on. It is right that this is debated more widely and that any changes to the law be considered in the context of such a debate, and not shoehorned arbitrarily into existing legislation.” **\[S3\].** There is **specific reference to the DABUS applications in informing questions 2\-6 of the UKIPO September 2020 Artificial Intelligence Call for Views: Patents**. **\[S9\]** 

1.  The UKIPO, EPO, as well as US Patent and Trademark Office, rejections are being appealed. Abbott’s work is instrumental in guiding preparations for the appeals **\[S1\]**. An appeal from the UKIPO decision was rejected by the High Court and a right to appeal that decision was granted by the Court of Appeal on 4<sup>th</sup> December 2020 because, “\[t\]he principle at stake is an important one.” \(Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Floyd\) 

1.  Consultations: Abbott’s research has helped prompt international recognition of the need to address protection for AI\-generated inventions. UKIPO **\[S9\]**, USPTO **\[S7\]** and WIPO launched public requests for consultation to develop new policies on AI\-generated inventions following the DABUS applications. These public consultations are another tangible effect of the impact that Abbott’s research is having through the DABUS litigation. 

1.  Shaping policy recommendations: Additionally, Abbott’s research has had specific impact in shaping policy recommendations issued by international patent law institutions. This further impact is evidenced in \(1\) a White Paper **for the World Economic Forum which heavily cites his publications \[S5\];**  \(2\) his membership of the European Commission Expert Working Group on New Technologies Formation; \(3 **\) the frequent citation of his academic work \(13 times\) in the September 2020 European Commission Final Report on ‘Trends and Developments in Artificial Intelligence’ \[S6\];** \(4\) citation of his work in the October 2020 USPTO Report on Public Views on Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property Policy **\[S7\]**;  \(5\) reference to his academic work by think tanks including the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation \(ITIF\) **\[S8\].** 

####  3. Shaping the debate \(societal, industrial, economic and governmental beneficiaries\) 

 Abbott’s expertise is sought after, and his insights are directing debate in the field. Lord Justice Kitchin \(UK Supreme Court\) noted in a UKIPO / WIPO\-sponsored keynote address that “Professor Ryan Abbott points out in one of his many interesting papers in this area that \[AI\-generated invention\] has been a reality for some time <…>” **\[S10\]**. He has been invited to present his work at industry events such as the annual meetings of the American Chemical Society, UK Bioindustry Association, and the International Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property, and to give advice directly to businesses seeking to apply AI to innovation \(including to IBM, Novartis, and Warner Music\). The patent applications, and Abbott’s involvement, received extensive press coverage, bringing the debate to a public audience, with the filings being first published by the Financial Times **\[S11\]**. Subsequent stories on the cases appeared in prominent media including the BBC, and Wall Street Journal **\[S12\]**. Managing IP Magazine, lists Abbott as one of the 50 most influential people in IP in 2019. The magazine writes, “Ryan Abbott is a leading academic specialising in law and technology, IP and life sciences. His work on artificial intelligence \(AI\) and IP has contributed to the international dialogue on how new technologies are challenging existing legal standards.” **\[S13\].**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Since 2014, new pre\-clinical simulation methods and equipment for replacement hip joints have been developed and commercialised in collaboration with industry partner Simulation Solutions.  A new international standard for pre\-clinical assessment of hip prostheses \(ISO14242\-4\) has been developed, approved and adopted.  This provides, for the first time, a recognised approach to evaluating hip implant designs and materials that simulate variation in surgical translational and rotational positioning, which leads to edge\-loading on the joint replacement.  New products developed using our advanced simulation methods by our industry partners DePuy Synthes, Invibio, and Mathys and demonstrating lower wear under real world conditions have benefited over 300,000 patients every year \(approximately 10 percent of the global market\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The starting point for this research programme in 2001 was the global clinical need for longer lasting and lower wearing total replacement hip and knee joints.  These improved prostheses can result in lower revision rates in the longer term \(10 to 30 years\) for an active ageing population with expectations of ‘fifty active years after fifty’<sup>®</sup>. 

 State\-of\-the\-art pre\-clinical joint simulation technology prior to 2001 represented a single activity standard for a normal walking cycle, described in the first international standard published in 2001 that was based upon our previous research.  These standard simulations were able to generate predictions for the average wear rates found in the general population.  They did not replicate the variation in conditions that can lead to deterioration and the variation in function and higher wear rates that result in the need for revision in individual patients. 

 Since 2001, our research programme has developed more advanced systems and methods to simulate different clinical conditions.  These include the effect of variations in surgical positioning \(including combinations of translational and rotational positioning\), resulting in edge loading in the hip joint bearing and the effect of variations of different activities, alignment and soft tissue reconstruction in the knee joint.  These methods have been subsequently adopted by industry. 

 In the hip: In 2001 we described that in alumina ceramic\-on\-ceramic bearings, simulation of dynamic microseparation of the centres of the bearing and replicating edge loading conditions led to stripe wear and higher levels of wear found clinically in some patients \[1\].  We went on to investigate the effect of edge loading in ceramic matrix composite, metal\-on\-metal, and polyethylene bearings.  We progressed this to investigate the causes of edge loading and the independent effects of the inclination of the cup and the medial lateral offset \[2\].  More recently, in 2017, we published on the combined effects of both inclination and offset on the bearing mechanics and function, the level and severity of separation, and edge loading.  This work demonstrated a synergistic effect with increased levels of inclination combined with increased offsets producing higher levels of separation \(>2 mm\), producing more severe edge loading and bearing damage, and further increases in wear \[3\]. 

 In the knee: In 2005 we created new experimental simulation systems and methods for the tibial femoral joint and reported on the effect of different kinematics on the wear of conventional polyethylene \[4\]<sup>.</sup>  This showed that increased internal external rotation resulted in increased wear.  We progressed this work in 2007 to develop simulations that showed abnormal abduction and lift off also increased wear \[5\].  More recently, our experimental simulations have been combined with advanced computational simulations to predict wear in cross\-linked polyethylene in knee prostheses \[6\].  The computational methods have been used to simulate contact mechanics and wear for different prostheses designs and for different femoral bearing materials. 

 The research was undertaken with collaborators in the University of Leeds Faculty of Biological Sciences \(Ingham and Tipper \(UoA 5\) \[1, 2\]\), and in the University of Denver \(Komistek \[5\]\).  Publications 1, 3, 4, and 6 also have industry collaborators as co\-authors.  Prior to leaving the University, **Al\-Hajjar**, **Abdelgaied**, **Bell** and **Haythornthwaite** contributed to the original research \[2–6\] as part of **Fisher**’s research group in the School of Mechanical Engineering. 

 The underpinning collaborative research work has been supported continuously by EPSRC since 2001, and has included Platform grants, Portfolio Partnership funding, and funding for the Medical Technologies IKC and Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Medical Devices \(see EPSRC ‘Grants on Web’\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Simulation equipment, methods and standards** 

 **Fisher** and **Jennings** have a long\-standing collaboration with the company Simulation Solutions.  Letter \[A\] corroborates that since 2013 the company has worked with **Fisher** and **Jennings** on “the advancement of novel simulation methods and systems and the development of simulation equipment”.  Since 2013, the company has “invested in the design and new product development of advanced equipment including new six\-axis electromechanical hip joint simulators EM13, 14, 16 and 17 and six axis electromechanical knee joint simulators”, and Simulation Solutions have “sold this novel simulation equipment and provided services and supported the use of these simulators in UK, Europe and Asia to global industry and research institutions”.  Since 2013, Simulation Solutions has “sold approximately 300 stations of simulator capacity with a value of around £15M, representing over 50% of the global market”, with the bulk of these sales being in Asia where “Simulation Solutions Ltd and the University of Leeds have worked together to raise levels of awareness and understanding of the need for more rigorous testing standards”. 

 In this period, **Fisher** and **Jennings** furthermore applied their research to initiate and author the new international standard \[B\] for pre\-clinical assessment of total hip prostheses \(ISO 14242\-4\), enabling wider use of the novel simulation methods to evaluate and demonstrate reduced wear under real world conditions and to improve the longevity of joint replacements under development.  Published in May 2018, the new standard has been approved and adopted globally to evaluate newly developed hip prostheses prior to CE mark approval.  Letter \[A\] confirms that Simulation Solutions supported the work of **Fisher** and **Jennings** in developing this standard, and in pursuing it to final approval and adoption.  **Jennings** also chaired the ISO standard sub\-committee for Bone and Joint Replacements \(ISO/TC 150/SC 4\) from 2012 to 2020 \[B\]. 

 **Improved products and new product development** 

 Since 2013, the University has applied its distinctive experimental simulation methods and systems, which subsequently formed the new standard, in collaborative research to support new product developments with implant manufacturers DePuy Synthes, Mathys, and Invibio to reduce wear \(under adverse real\-world conditions\) and improve the longevity of new joint replacements.  We provide direct evidence through our cited industrial collaborations of our research impacting on over 300,000 joint replacement implants per year, more than 10% of the global market. 

 <ins>DePuy</ins> <ins>Synthes</ins>:  Letter \[C\] corroborates the benefit of the collaborative research with the University since 2013, and gives two examples: 

-  The continued sales of ceramic\-on\-ceramic bearings and the increased sales of ceramic femoral heads for hip prostheses.  In REF2014 we reported sales by DePuy of approximately 50,000/annum ceramic composite femoral heads.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Children and young people in care in the UK, on average, achieve lower levels of educational attainment than their peers. Cardiff’s work on the educational experiences of these children directly informed the Welsh Government’s strategy, developed innovative methods to engage young people, and generated creative materials, training, workshops and online communities of practice, all of which improved the overall educational experiences of care experienced children and young people. Mannay’s related work with cultural and arts institutions led to changes in their strategies and programming to better support marginalised children and young people, including those who are care experienced. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The complex and disrupted home circumstances of children and young people in care can prevent them from succeeding academically. This results in a pervasive gap in educational attainment between children in care and their peers. In Wales – where the number of children and young people in care is rising \(6,845 recorded in 2019\) – there is a gap of 19 percentage points at Key Stage 2, which increases to 37 percentage points at Key Stage 4. 

 In January 2015, the Welsh Government commissioned Mannay and Cardiff University’s CASCADE \(Children’s Social Care Research and Development Centre\) to lead a multidisciplinary academic team undertaking the research project ‘Understanding the educational experiences and opinions, attainment, achievement and aspirations of Looked After Children and Young People in Wales’ **\[G3.1\]**. 

 This was the UK’s first study to report on the lived educational experiences and school transitions of care experienced children and young people. Existing literature and data on care and education were combined with a systematic review of randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions aimed at care experienced children and young people **\[3.1\]**. The researchers also engaged with 65 care experienced children and young people across Wales, through interviews and focus groups. Two care leavers were also trained as peer researchers to facilitate focus groups with young people no longer in compulsory education. 

 Key findings included **\[3.2\]**: 

-  Young people feel that foster carers should have a set of basic skills to support education; 

-  Lack of funding for educational equipment, especially IT, is a key barrier; 

-  Care experienced young people suffer educationally and socially from disruption caused by placement moves, school transitions, and social work meetings during school hours. 

 Children and young people interviewed were aspirational but some struggled to realise their ambitions because of unresolved emotional issues, limited opportunities, and unsupportive relationships. The findings were developed into 17 recommendations **\[**see **3.2\]**. These covered key themes including: support for school transitions; access to educational resources and additional support for children and young people; training for teachers, foster carers and social workers; and improving communications between key stakeholders. 

 **2.1 Foregrounding the voices and lived experiences of children and young people** 

 The Cardiff team used a range of participatory arts\-based techniques to encourage children and young people to actively participate in the research process, generate data, and disseminate messages **\[3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]**. This innovative work was recognised with the 2017 Research Innovation Award from the Social Research Association Wales, the 2017 Health and Care Research Wales Public Involvement Achievement Award, and the 2018 Learned Society of Wales Dillwyn Medal. It also led to invitations to contribute to and lead on other research projects related to improving the lives of care experienced children and young people, including collaborations with The Fostering Network, Wales Millennium Centre, and the National Museum Wales **\[G3.2, G3.3\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **4.1 Informing and shaping policy** 

 *“Obviously if your life is unstable, your education is unstable, and then that’s your future ruined”* – a female participant in one of Mannay’s 16\+ focus groups when asked about being a looked after child in school **\[3.1**; also quoted in **5.1\]**. 

 The Cardiff team’s 17 recommendations **\[3.2\]** were all incorporated into the Welsh Government’s 2016 strategy *‘Raising the ambitions and educational attainment of children who are looked after in Wales’* **\[5.1\]**.  Jonathan Jones, a Senior Policy Manager for the Welsh Government’s Education and Public Services Group, confirmed that *“the results of the study formed the bedrock for the strategy”* **\[5.2\]**. Three examples of how the recommendations fed into policy actions are outlined below: 

-  Research recommendation 1 centralised the importance of a rigorous evidence\-base for educational interventions. This aligns with policy action 34, which prioritises capturing effective interventions which are proven to have the greatest impact. 

-  Response: The Welsh Government and Adoption UK \(Wales\) provided information on effective interventions to better support adopted children in education, as well as children who are looked after by the local authority **\[5.1, 5.3\]**. 

-  Research recommendation 2 on school transitions aligns with policy action 22, which emphasises information sharing prior to a child starting a new school. 

  -  Response: The Welsh Government examined current information sharing practices between schools and practitioners with responsibility for children who are looked after. A key theme of this work was improving transitional arrangements **\[5.3\]**. 

-  Research recommendation 6 called for training for foster carers to better support the children in their care with their education. It aligns with policy action 9 which tasks regional education consortia with supporting foster carers with appropriate training which has a specific educational focus. 

  -  Response: The Welsh Government commissioned the Fostering Wellbeing programme which increases foster carers’ access to peer support, training, and information; supported the publication of ‘ *A foster carer’s Guide to Education in Wales*’; and allocated a portion of the Pupil Development Grant to provide training for foster carers **\[5.3\]**. 

 The Welsh Government thanked the research team for “ *constructive support in helping to make a difference to the lives of children who have experienced time in the care system”* **\[5.3\]**. The research’s foregrounding of lived experiences was also acknowledged, in particular: *“the views of these learners have been used to inform the actions in this strategy”* **\[5.1\]**. Jonathan Jones confirmed the research’s significant influence on the work of the Welsh Government, practitioners, teachers, and other stakeholders, helping to *“shape some incredible policies which are making a real difference to some of our most disadvantaged children and families in Wales”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 A review of the strategy one year on reported examples of educational progress for care experienced young people **\[5.3\]**. For example, in 2016 23% of children who are looked after achieved the Level 2 GCSE threshold, an improvement of 6% on the 2015 attainment figure. 

 **4.2 Changing practices** 

 The 2015 study had an immediate impact on practice in Wales. Research recommendations were incorporated into the Welsh Government’s new guidance *‘Making a difference – A guide for the designated person for looked after children in schools’* **\[5.4\]**. Jonathan Jones confirmed that *“the excellent research conducted by CASCADE through engaging with care experienced young people really helped to develop the guide”* **\[5.2\]**. For example, the guidance states that *“all meetings for looked after children \(for reasons related to their care circumstances\) should be held outside of lesson times”* **\[5.4\]**. This draws directly from the research finding **\[3.1\]** that care experienced children and young people suffer educationally from the disruption of attending social care meetings during school hours. 

 The Welsh Government also commissioned Mannay and CASCADE to develop two online hubs providing resources for educators, social care practitioners, third sector workers, researchers, and carers with an interest in improving the educational outcomes of children in care and for supporting children and families more widely: 

-  Exchange: Care and Education \[total funding of £76,453 from 2017\-2020 **\[G3.2\]**\] builds more effective communications between designated lead members of staff in schools, carers and social workers. 

-  Exchange: Family and Community \[total funding of £59,410 from 2019\-2021 **\[G3.3\]**\) is a forum for members of Welsh Government initiatives aimed at i\) services for children aged 0\-3 and ii\) improving outcomes for children, young people and families. It was a main repository for Government notices and practitioner guidance during coronavirus **\[5.2\]**. 

 These communities of practice have had a combined engagement of 19,998 page views and their resources have been viewed by visitors from across the UK and globally. 

 Mannay used ESRC Impact Acceleration Account funding \[total funding of £48,429 from 2016\-2017\] to generate additional outputs and workshops aimed at creating more effective relationships between individuals and agencies. Over 1,000 key stakeholders \(including policymakers, practitioners, students, and young people\) attended events \(conferences, workshops and training\) in Wales, England, Ireland and Northern Ireland to learn how to embed recommendations into their everyday practice. Attendees provided feedback on how the research findings will directly inform their future practice **\[5.5\]**, for example: 

-  *‘I will… ensure that appointments for young people take place outside of education hours’* – Education Officer, Youth Offending Service \- Wales; 

-  ‘*I have already presented the main points from the event at a team meeting and interface meeting with social workers. I have requested a meeting with LAC education team to discuss the issues raised and will formulate an action plan*’ – Independent Reviewing Officer – Wales; 

-  ‘*Doing more visual and collaborative work with children and young people to disseminate findings’* – Third Sector Researcher – England. 

 **4.3 Benefits of co\-production and creative engagement for individuals and organisations** 

 Educational research studies often do not reach the people who would benefit from hearing their key messages. To directly engage these key stakeholders, the Cardiff team developed creative and accessible materials, some of which were co\-produced with children and young people. For example: 

-  The research findings **\[3.1\]** formed the basis for 7 films, 4 music videos, 6 graphic art pieces, 6 comic strips, a special edition of the magazine *Thrive* \(delivered to all young people in foster care in Wales\), and 2 magazines for foster carers \(5,000 copies of each were delivered to foster families in Wales\) **\[5.6a\].** 

-  The \#messagestoschools campaign – developed with input from young people, foster carers and practitioners – which presented the ideas that young people wanted their teachers to think about. Campaign materials were posted and emailed to 1,600 schools in Wales, with designated teachers displaying them in workplace settings and using them in their practice. 

-  Film projects with the South West Wales Reaching Wider Partnership and the Roots Foundation Wales who support the education of children and young people in care. 

 Maria Boffey, Head of Operations for the Fostering Network, the UK’s leading fostering charity, confirmed that “ *foster carers have provided us with feedback about how the films, magazines and workshops have offered advice, ideas and information that has helped them to better support children and young people in their care”* **\[5.6b\]**. 

 Emma Jones, Independent Living Coordinator, Roots Foundation commented: *“The young people tell us that they don't always get the chance to have their voices heard… the films have been shared amongst both student social workers and practicing social workers… many say it has changed their practice, for the better”* **\[5.7\]**. 

 Due to the value demonstrated through these visual and creative research approaches, the Wales Millennium Centre \(WMC\) commissioned Mannay to evaluate an arts project supporting care experienced children and foster carers **\[5.8\]**. This informed the WMC’s ten\-year strategy. Graeme Farrow, Artistic Director, WMC confirmed: *“We witnessed a sustained impact on confidence and self\-belief, with young people connecting to the value of their own voice and agency and building a significant social connection with their peers... The activity and project have also significantly impacted our own organisational development. Specifically, helping us to find a way to better integrate activities that combine personal, social and creative skills''* **\[5.9\]**. 

 Amgueddfa Cymru/National Museum Wales \(AC/NMW\) invited Mannay to co\-produce projects with marginalised young people and involve them in their Hands on Heritage programme \(ESRC Secondment £12,815\). Mannay’s report is informing the Hands on Heritage Action Plan and the development of AC/NMW’s 10\-Year Strategy **\[5.10\]**. Owain Rhys, Head of Volunteering and Engagement, AC/NMW commented that the report was an *“impressive, comprehensive and invaluable contribution”* and that it *“will guide the expansion of Hands on Heritage, and contribute to better educational and developmental experiences for children and young people, in particular marginalised communities, including those who are care experienced, excluded from formal education and/or living in areas of multiple deprivation, who have not traditionally engaged with Amgueddfa Cymru”* **\[5.10\]**. 

 In summary, Cardiff’s work to improve the educational experiences of children and young people in care has had lasting impact on policy and practice in Wales, with the scale and reach extended through Mannay’s related work with cultural and arts institutions. Throughout all of this, the team ensured that children and young people have *“an opportunity to be heard”*, a decision which will have *“lasting impact on themselves, the care experienced community and future generations to come”* **\[5.7\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Osteopathy has historically been underpinned by a limited evidence base, but UCO research studies have had a cumulative impact on improving professional knowledge and changing the culture of practice. Empirical knowledge has been generated \- about treatment risks and adverse events to improve safety in clinical practice; to improve osteopaths’ awareness of, and attitudes to, using evidence\-informed practice; and to develop guidelines to support best practice for common musculoskeletal conditions. A portfolio of outputs influenced changes in the General Osteopathic Council’s \(GOsC\) standards of practice and continuing professional development \(CPD\) regulations for the specified activities required for annual registration. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 To explore safety issues in osteopathic practice, **SV** led the Clinical Risk in Osteopathy and Management study \(CROaM\) \( **1.** **Vogel et al, 2013**\), funded by the GOsC to gather data on adverse effects. The survey included 1,082 UK osteopaths \(27.8%\) and 2,057 patients \(77% at 6 week follow\-up\), plus interviews with 19 patients and 24 practitioners. Temporary side\-effects were reported by 4% of patients, but not directly linked to manipulation. Concerning deficits in osteopaths’ communication and consent processes were identified. The report concluded that serious problems were rare, but osteopaths should be vigilant about risk. Enhanced guidance about consent and adverse event reporting were recommended. Following this, **OT** co\-authored a GOsC\-funded report to identify how regulatory activities could support practice and align with professional standards \( **2.** **McGivern et al 2015**\). Literature reviews explored scope of practice, health professional regulation and fitness to practise, with an online survey of 809 osteopaths \(17%\) and 55 interviews. Limited evidence about treatment risks and benefits were reported as sources of professional insecurity and ambivalence about evidence\-based practice \(EBP\). Diverse approaches made standard\-based regulation complex, especially with independent practitioners. The report recommended introducing peer discussions into osteopathic regulation processes. 

 Subsequently, **OT** collaborated in a survey of osteopaths’ attitudes to EBP; the Evidence\-Based Practice Attitude and Utilisation Survey \(EBASE\) \( **3.** **Sundberg et al 2017**\). Generally positive attitudes and moderate\-level skills, but infrequent use of EBP were reported by 375 osteopaths. Perceived barriers included lack of time and limited osteopathic evidence, indicating the need to improve osteopaths’ use of EBP in clinical practice. To promote to EBP, **SV** participated in a guideline development group; NICE guidelines for low back pain and sciatica in over 16s \( **4.** **NICE 2016**\). New recommendations that manual therapy should only be offered in packages incorporating exercises or psychological interventions highlighted an urgent need to change  monomodal, biomechanical treatment models, prompting research into biopsychosocial approaches \(Case Study 2\). **SV** also collaborated in developing the IFOMPT Cervical Framework Document \( **5.** **Rushton et al 2020**\), providing guidance for physical therapists to minimise risks in the clinical management of patients with head and neck pain. Arterial pathologies in the neck may masquerade as musculoskeletal dysfunction and lead to serious consequences if not identified. New guidance about  avoiding provocative positional testing were based on its’ low predictive ability and potential adverse test effects. Recommended changes in history taking, examination and decision\-making were used to strengthen osteopathic training and CPD. 

 Paediatric osteopathy is also limited by lack of evidence on treatment effects. **DC** led a systematic review into manual therapy effects for unsettled, distressed and excessively crying infants \( **6.** **Carnes et al 2017**\). Nineteen studies \(seven RCTs\) found moderate strength evidence for favourable effects on crying time but inconclusive results for sleep and parent\-child relations. Risks were low at seven non\-serious events per 1000 infants. It was unclear whether the small effect sizes were meaningful, but manual therapy was relatively safe. Findings led to development of a randomised controlled trial in paediatric osteopathy.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research into the risks of adverse events, especially in cervical spine assessment and manipulation, and into communication and informed consent led to substantive changes in the General Osteopathic Council’s \(GOsC\) regulatory policies. The cumulative impact of  [<ins>UCO research on adverse events</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/research-surveys/gosc-research/adverse-events/) is documented in committee reports about changes to the Osteopathic Practice Standards \(OPS\), Guidelines for Osteopathic Pre\-Registration Osteopathic Education \(GOPRE\) and Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) scheme. 

 The Clinical Risk in Osteopathy and Management study \(CROaM\) identified deficits in communication about consent \( [<ins>Vogel et al 2013</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/research-and-surveys/the-croam-study-february-2013/croam-full-report-0313.pdf)\). A report on professional regulation and compliance with standards identified challenges in monitoring osteopaths with diverse clinical practices \( [<ins>McGivern et al 2015</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/research-surveys/gosc-research/research-to-promote-effective-regulation/)\).  [<ins>Rushton et</ins> <ins>al’s</ins>](https://www.ifompt.org/site/ifompt/IFOMPT%20Cervical%20Framework%20final%20September%202020.pdf) \(2020\) IFOMPT report outlined risks relating to cervical spine treatment. This data has been incorporated into changes in GOsC expectations about standards of practice for qualified osteopaths \( **Source 1,**  [<ins> **GOsC</ins> <ins>2018**</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/about-the-gosc/pac-june-2018-osteopathic-practice-standards-implementation/)\) and levels of competence in undergraduate student education \( **Source 2,**  [<ins> **GOsC</ins> <ins>2020**</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/about-the-gosc/pec-october-2020-item-3-review-of-guidance-for-pre-registration/)\). Regulatory changes also include requirements for osteopaths to engage in case\-based peer discussions as part of three\-year CPD cycles, recommended by McGivern et al \(2015\) to promote engagement with standards in confidential, formative activities to highlight weaknesses and reduce misconduct, whilst acknowledging diverse attitudes and approaches. Osteopaths must now also participate in formal ‘Communication and Consent’ CPD activities \( **Source 3,**  [<ins> **GOsC**</ins>](https://cpd.osteopathy.org.uk/themes/communication-and-consent/) <ins> **2021**</ins>\). 

 The study of clinical risks \(Vogel et al 2013\) led to a collaborative review of assessment methods for serious cervical spine dysfunctions \( **Source 4**  [<ins> **Vaughan et al 2016**</ins>](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2016.01.007)\). Findings have been used to enhance osteopaths’ communication, consent and clinical reasoning skills in popular, ongoing <ins>CPD</ins>  [<ins>courses</ins>. <ins>Communication and consent</ins>](https://cpd.uco.ac.uk/communication-and-consent-14-may-2021) ran 10 times between 2014 and 2020 with 274 osteopaths \( **Source 5a**\). Findings from CROaM also generated CPD courses about the risks specific to  [<ins>cervical spine assessment and consent</ins>](https://cpd.uco.ac.uk/cervical-spine-risk-assessment-and-consent-for-manual-therapists-30-january-2021) \( **Source** **5b**\), which ran 9 times between 2017 and 2020 with 258 osteopaths and other health practitioners. IFOMPT recommended changes to decision\-making processes for cervical spine manipulation \(Rushton et al 2020\) and recommended that practitioners should now avoid provocative testing. This guidance has been integrated into courses which cover shared decision\-making, informed consent, medico\-legal frameworks, and safety issues for practitioners who teach cervical spine manipulation techniques. 

 The GOsC commissioned a follow\-up study to McGivern et al \(2015\), which recently reported that attitudes to EBP within the profession have changed in response to guidance from research\-active OEIs \( **Source 6**  [<ins> **McGivern et al 2020**</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/about-the-gosc/pec-october-2020-item-9-mcgivern-research/)\). UCO contributions to this sea change include SV’s involvement in NICE \(2016\) guideline development, which increased national awareness of EBP for back pain and supported his subsequent contribution to the  [<ins>National Back Pain Pathway,</ins> ](https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/charles-greenough/)which guided EB implementation by national CCGs. In the UCO, changes in clinical training since 2017 require students to identify use of guidelines in their documented patient assessment and management plans. Recent qualitative research reported increased awareness and positive attitudes, but continued lack of confidence in using EBP **\(Source 7**  [<ins> **Inman and Thomson 2019**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2019.01.001)\), indicating a need for further skills training \(Case Study 2\). The UK survey of attitudes to EBP \( [<ins>Sundberg et al 2018</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-018-2354-6)\) was replicated in Australia \( **Source 8**  [<ins> **Leach et al 2019**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4329-1)\), and subsequently in Sweden, Spain and Italy, which raised osteopaths’ awareness internationally. Similar findings in several countries has prompted research into barriers to EBP implementation, with future impact anticipated from a recently published systematic review protocol \( [<ins>Sampath et al 2020</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2020.01.001)\). 

 In the UK, osteopaths deliver paediatric care for approximately 1 in every 9\-11 children, but there is limited evidence about manual therapy effects on infants and parents and carers. Many infants treated by osteopaths have symptoms of colic including excessive crying, unsettled, distressed or difficult to console, but evidence of effect is limited \(Carnes et al 2018\). A recent systematic review indicated favourable but weak evidence for crying time \( **Source 9**  [<ins> **Ellwood et al 2020**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035405)\), highlighting an urgent need for new research. This led to the development of CUTIES, the Crying Unsettled and disTressed Infants Effectiveness Study of osteopathic care \( **Source 10**  [<ins> **Carnes et al 2020**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2020.08.001)\). This two\-arm, multi\-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial is recruiting 112 infants, randomised to receive best practice advice and support plus either specific or non\-specific \(control\) light touch manual therapy. Parents are blinded to group and outcomes include crying time over 14 days, parent satisfaction, adverse events and cost. Results anticipated in 2022 will generate evidence about treatment effect and provide the Advertising Standards Authority with data to assess the validity of advertising osteopathy for this common, distressing paediatric condition.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Peter Robinson’s research created revolutionary digital standards in two areas: first, the creation of machine\-readable descriptions of internationally significant literary\-historical manuscripts, thereby contributing to their preservation through innovative use of technology; and second, the making of digital editions of primary texts. Both standards have been adopted by the international Text Encoding Initiative, itself contributing to multiple International Organization for Standardization \(ISO\) standards, and used across the world, benefiting international research libraries, commercial publishers, editors and book readers. These standards have transformed scholarly practice in creating new editions based on manuscripts, enabled libraries to catalogue them uniformly, and substantially lowered the costs for commercial publishers to make modern editions of them, facilitating public access to these culturally enriching, historically significant texts. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Peter Robinson’s research into both areas \(manuscript descriptions and digital editions of primary texts\) was developed at DMU’s Centre for Technology and the Arts \(CTA\) during 2000–2004. One of the CTA’s first major projects involved Robinson working with Norman Blake \(DMU 1998–2004\) to create new editions of Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales* based on fresh analysis of all the early manuscripts \(Arts and Humanities Research Board \(now AHRC\), funded GBP394,000 in 1999–2004\). Created by two leading medievalists, their cutting\-edge digital editions of Chaucer were at the forefront of research in the digital humanities. They also highlighted the fact that the prevailing digital document encoding standard at the time – the Text Encoding Initiative \(TEI\) P3 standard – could not cope with the problems of encoding 400\- to 600\-year\-old English manuscripts. 

 From examining hundreds of relevant manuscripts, Robinson derived, in 2000, a new taxonomy for contextualising information that could be extended by repetition within elements to produce manuscript descriptions of unprecedented length and sophistication. This new standard for manuscript description was formally defined via the newly created Extensible Markup Language \(XML\), the advanced features of which it was among the first to exploit \[R1, R3\]. 

 Robinson recognised that were his standard to be adopted by libraries worldwide, it would enable the creation of an online union catalogue of all their manuscript holdings, and that it could go on to provide a means for editors to create more consistently edited modern editions of manuscripts and give publishers a streamlined workflow for the more efficient and cost\-effective publication of those editions in print and digital form \[R2, R4, R5\]. 

 Robinson's new standard had two paths for dissemination: \(1\) through the worldwide acceptance of the TEI guidelines embodying his standard for use by anyone wishing to create a new scholarly edition based on manuscript materials, and \(2\) through a specific project to improve access to manuscript materials by unifying existing catalogues of them. Robinson had already initiated the ‘Manuscript Access Through Standards for Electronic Records’ \(MASTER\) project, funded by the European Union Framework IV \(EUR376,000, 1999–2003\). Because of the invention of Robinson’s standard \(2000\), DMU became in 2001 the lead partner of six collaborating European universities in MASTER as it settled on Robinson’s standard as its primary technical means for accomplishing its ends and began to promulgate the standard and distribute the necessary software for its adoption. 

 When Robinson invented his new standard, the CTA \(Centre for Textual Studies from 2004\) was already engaged in the creation of scholarly digital editions that immediately benefited by adopting it, including Julia Briggs's \(DMU 1994–2008\) and Peter Shillingsburg’s \(DMU 2002–2010\) *Woolf 'Time Passes'* project \(Leverhulme Trust, GBP52,780; 2006\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Over the census period, the reach, significance and impact of Robinson’s new standards for describing and editing literary\-historical manuscripts has been sustained and global: it has contributed to the cultural preservation of internationally significant manuscripts and it has benefited libraries and archives managing world\-class manuscript collections, editors, commercial publishers and readers, through positive changes in the way books based on manuscript sources are created, published and catalogued. 

##  \(1\) LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES: ENHANCING THE PRESERVATION AND CATALOGUING OF LITERARY\-CULTURAL HERITAGE 

 The impact of Robinson’s research has been felt by libraries and archives managing manuscript collections, via the MASTER and ENRICH projects. In this  REF census period, Robinson’s standard has been used within the MASTER project to achieve catalogue integration across the holdings of the Royal Library in the Hague; the Arnamagnaean Institute, Copenhagen; L’Institut de recherche et d’histoire des textes, Paris; the National Library of the Czech Republic, Prague; the Bodleian Library, Oxford; the British Library; the Vatican Library; and the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan. This amounts to 61,000 manuscripts – the core of Europe’s rare manuscript holdings – being more discoverable by readers than would have been possible without Robinson’s standard \[C2\]. 

 The EU\-funded EUR45,570,000 ENRICH project \(2007–2009\) built upon Robinson’s achievement with MASTER and adopted his standard \[C3\]. It created a base for a digital library of European cultural heritage, which now makes available more than 5,000,000 digitised pages for a wide range of non\-academic users, including libraries, museums and archives, policymakers and lay readers. Examples include the National Library of the Czech Republic, Prague; Centro per comunicazione e l’integrazione dei media, Florence; SYSTRAN SA, Paris; and Biblioteca Nacional de España, Madrid. This digital library, enabled by Robinson’s standard, puts Europe’s manuscript collection before the eyes of thousands of lay and scholarly readers each year every year in the current census period. 

##  \(2\) COMMERCIAL PUBLISHING: ENHANCING MANUSCRIPT EDITING AND PUBLISHING PRACTICES 

 The impact of Robinson’s research has been felt by publishers of books based on manuscripts, via the TEI P5 Guidelines \[C1\]. Since 2014, large\-scale digital projects have continued to adopt the TEI P5 standard incorporating Robinson’s work \[C4\] and so have commercial publishers \[C5\]. When publishing materials based on manuscript sources, publishers’ use of Robinson’s standard provides a simpler, more efficient means of encoding manuscripts than was previously available and thereby enables the production of trade and scholarly editions of those manuscripts at lower costs. 

##  \(3\) READERS: ENHANCED PUBLIC ACCESS TO CULTURALLY ENRICHING LITERARY\-HISTORICAL SOURCES 

 Since 2014, trade and academic publishers have used the Robinson manuscript\-encoding standard to create editions of works by a range of public figures and canonical and non\-canonical authors. This includes 77 editions of writers’ personal correspondence \[C5\], such as *The Letters of John F. Kennedy* \(2013\), *The Letters of Noël Coward* \(2014\), *The Correspondence of Charles Darwin* \(2014\), *The Letters of Samuel Beckett* \(2014\), *The Correspondence of Sigmund and Anne Freud* \(2014\), *Jane Austen’s Letters* \(2014\), *The Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia* \(2015\), *The Letters of Ernest Hemingway* \(2015\) and *The Letters of Oliver Goldsmith* \(2018\). 

 Other editions made from manuscript sources using Robinson’s digital edition standards \[C5\] include works by well\-known authors, such as *Ben Jonson’s Walk to Scotland: An Annotated Edition of the ‘Foot Voyage’* \(2014\), *The Works of Robert Burns* \(2014\), *The Collected Works of Gerard Manley Hopkins* \(2014\), *Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: Heidelberg Writings* \(2015\) and *The Sermons of John Donne* \(2015\), as well as historically significant texts such as *The Complete Bill of Rights: The Drafts, Debates, Sources, and Origins* \(2015\). 

 Commercial publishers of books based on manuscript sources are under no obligation to adopt any particular standards and have chosen Robinson’s as it simplifies manuscript\-encoding protocols, lowering their costs and enabling them to produce editions that otherwise might not have been commercially viable. Non\-canonical manuscript editions that have benefited this way and been made publicly available, include: *The Household Account Book of Sarah Fell of Swarthmoor Hall* \(2014\), *Every Day Lasts a Year: A Jewish Family’s Correspondence from Poland* \(2014\), *The Letters of Lady Anne Bacon* \(2014\), *In Defence of the Slave Trade: Stephen Fuller, Jamaica and the West India Parliamentary Lobby at Westminster, 1788–1795* \(2014\), *The Correspondence of John Campbell MP with His Family, Henry Fox, Sir Robert Walpole and the Duke of Newcastle, 1734–1771* \(2014\), *The Egyptian Historian ʿAbd al\-Raḥmān al\-Jabartī: His Life, Works, Autographs, Manuscripts and the Historical Sources of ʿAjāʾib al\-Āthār* \(2014\) and *Lady Nugent’s East India Journal* \(2016\) \[C5\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A patented light\-scattering technology developed through University of Hertfordshire \(UH\) research, initially for the real\-time detection of airborne pathogens like anthrax in military and counter\-terror scenarios, has been commercially exploited for bioaerosol monitoring in health and environmental contexts. Licensed by the MOD’s Ploughshare Innovations to two SMEs in the United States to maximise returns from UK defence spending, the technology has generated £700,000 in licensing income \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\], created 22 jobs and raised £3m in investment. Use of the technology resulted in further economic and societal impact. It has delivered significant commercial advantages and revenues to a Fortune 1000 company, SMEs, business franchises and individual contractors in the specialist cleaning and disaster restoration sector. It has supported schools, hotels, cultural institutions and governments with building decontamination following Covid\-19 lockdowns in the US. \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\], informed the UK and Irish governments’ policy approaches to pollen, spore and biowaste monitoring, and identified infection risk in hospitals.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The ability to rapidly detect airborne biological warfare agents was a government imperative following the Gulf War in 1991 and the rise in terror attacks in the early 2000s. This drove the development of technologies for the real\-time detection and classification of airborne microorganisms. A technology of growing interest was that of autofluorescence; the identification of an organism from its intrinsic fluorescence spectrum under ultraviolet excitation. However, all commercially available biofluorescence instruments used frequency\-quadrupled UV Diode Pumped Solid State lasers and their prohibitive cost made implementing wide\-area networks of bioaerosol detectors impractical. 

 Kaye, Hirst and Stanley at UH’s Centre for Atmospheric and Climate Physics Research had developed a class\-leading diode pumped solid state \(DPSS\) UV laser\-based detector for the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory \(Dstl\) in 2000 \[ **3.1**\]. In 2001 they were challenged by Dstl to develop a new type of bioaerosol detector that was affordable enough to be deployed in wide networks \(i.e. for large numbers of troops\) to detect potential biowarfare agents. Very few alternatives to DPSS lasers existed that could offer similar UV radiant powers. One was the ubiquitous xenon flashlamp, then being widely used in disposable cameras. However, such flashlamps presented major research challenges. These included the need to: substantially improve the ‘blocking’ of radiation from the flashlamps outside the desired UV wavelength bands; designing compact high\-efficiency optical systems both to deliver the UV radiation to the particle and capture resulting fluorescence \(involving custom\-designed mirrors and coatings\); aerodynamic modelling of aerosol delivery systems to ensure particles carried in the sample airflow were exposed individually to the UV radiation; and optically quenching unwanted fluorescence from other components within the instrument that threatened to dominate the ultra\-weak fluorescence from the microorganisms. 

 Under the initial Dstl grant \[ **G1**\], the Group developed the world’s first low\-cost xenon\-based UV biofluorescence detector, the WIBS \(Wide Issue Bioaerosol Sensor\) \[ **3.2, 3.3**\]. Follow\-on funding from Dstl – £500,000 over five years \[ **G2**\] – allowed researchers to further develop the WIBS technology, greatly improving the fluorescence efficiency and dynamic range of the design, improving aerodynamic management of the aerosol sample flow and, for the first time, incorporating a light\-scattering\-based particle shape measurement to enhance microorganism classification. By 2009, the WIBS biodetection technology was class\-leading, as demonstrated in joint field trials by the US and UK military, and sensitive enough to detect a single airborne spore of *Bacillus globigii*, a surrogate for anthrax. It was patented worldwide by Dstl \[ **3.3**\]. 

 The success of these trials led to further funding \[ **G3**\] from Dstl and the Home Office \(whose interest lay in counterterrorism\) to enhance fluorescence sensitivity and particle shape classification, and to support enhanced data analysis and bio\-organism classification algorithms. WIBS’ versatility in detecting and classifying airborne bio\-organisms attracted attention from other academic groups interested in exploiting WIBS to study the role of bioaerosols in atmospheric dynamics and in health\-related fields such as allergen \(e.g. spores, pollen\) dispersion. UH worked with the University of Manchester to use the WIBS instrument to gather, for the first time, detailed temporal information on the dispersal of biological particles below and above a tropical rainforest canopy in Borneo \[ **3.4**\]. Ireland’s Environmental Protection Agency funded UH to increase WIBS’ range to allow pollen detection, leading to WIBS\-4, the fourth generation of the instrument. The UH\-Manchester collaboration, with Dstl, used this WIBS to analyse biological aerosol particles in a Colorado forest \[ **3.5**\], as part of the BEACHON project in the US, which explored the roles of biogenic aerosols, nitrogen trace gases and oxidants in regulating carbon and water cycles. 

 As the applicability of WIBS beyond the military became evident, Dstl explored commercial opportunities through Ploughshare Innovations, the MOD’s technology transfer arm. Research and development of the WIBS technology continued at UH with the design of the Multiparameter Bioaerosol Spectrometer \(MBS\), which offered enhanced particle fluorescence spectral resolution and high\-resolution particle shape and surface feature analysis for single airborne biological particles \[ **3.6**\]. The UH team has since continued to build new MBS research instruments and improve the existing ones, including a major upgrade for the University of Manchester that was completed in 2019.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The patented WIBS technology has generated licensing revenues for reinvestment in UK defence by the MOD. It has generated commercial revenues for both SMEs and large corporations in the United States, created new jobs and raised external investment. It has delivered significant benefits to companies within the specialist cleaning and disaster restoration sector, and has supported schools and public buildings in their responses to Covid\-19. It has also \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\], informed environmental policy in the UK and Ireland, and identified infection risks in hospitals. 

 **Commercial and reputational benefits to the Ministry of Defence \(MOD\)** 

 Ploughshare Innovations is an MOD\-owned company with a remit to maximise the benefit of public expenditure in defence research through commercial exploitation of technology developed by Dstl. Ploughshare licensed the WIBS technology to US company Droplet Measurement Technologies \(DMT\), a world\-leading manufacturer of aerosol measurement devices, in 2012, and to another US company DetectionTek, a specialist in indoor air quality monitoring, in 2015, and has received royalties from sales throughout the impact period. Since 1 August 2013 it has accrued total revenues of £700,000: £350,000 from the DMT licence; £200,000 from the DetectionTek licence; and £150,000 from another US company who purchased the option to bring WIBS to the pharmaceutical market \[ **5.1**\]. In the context of Ploughshare’s £2m annual turnover the company’s Chief Operating Officer confirmed: *“For us these are significant deals and we are optimistic about the potential for high revenue growth in the near future across both licences.”* In 2016 Ploughshare amended the licensing agreement with DMT to specify new applications of WIBS and new markets, including China and India, benefitting from an increase in royalties through sales to these countries. Revenues generated by Ploughshare are reinvested by Dstl in the UK’s defence capabilities. The successes of the WIBS technology have also helped Ploughshare demonstrate the effectiveness of the MOD’s technology transfer model. According to Ploughshare’s COO: *“While we are judged on our contribution to the MOD’s commitment to economic growth creation, we want to make sure that great technologies developed for defence purposes are put to wider societal use for the benefit of as many people as possible. The WIBS licensing agreements have helped us to achieve this.”* \[ **5.1**\] 

 **Direct economic impact via commercial exploitation of WIBS in the United States** 

 With technical support from Kaye, DMT further developed the WIBS technology and in 2016 launched the WIBS\-NEO, an instrument providing detailed information on atmospheric bacteria, moulds, pollen and other bioaerosols. \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] \[ **5.2**\]. \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\]. DMT’s WIBS\-NEO customers comprise government agencies, research institutes and universities, who use it in a range of applications including biological testing, indoor air quality monitoring, airborne bioaerosol concentration and atmospheric monitoring. Since 1 August 2013, around 280 peer\-reviewed journal publications have cited WIBS data. \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] \[ **5.2**\] 

 DetectionTek, which agreed a licence with Ploughshare in 2015, worked with the University of Colorado Boulder to adapt the WIBS instrument into the commercial product InstaScope for indoor air quality monitoring and assessment. By counting and characterising bioaerosols on a particle\-by\-particle basis, the instrument, built around WIBS technology, provides real\-time data on viruses, bacteria, mould and pollen. It was first used by disaster restoration companies and technicians dealing with floods and leaks to quantify, on site, how much airborne contamination was present as remediation progressed. InstaScope can deliver results in real\-time \(this process used to take several days\) and at far less cost than previously possible \[ **5.3**\]. This allows contractors to deploy equipment to control contamination levels \(thus protecting the health of occupants\) and to defend their billing to insurance companies \[ **5.3**\]. 

 Responding to the Covid\-19 pandemic, DetectionTek made a significant investment in the development of new software that allows InstaScope to assess whether or not a room, such as a school classroom, has the lowest possible occupant exposure to bio particles after it has been sanitised. Before cleaning, the instrument is used to measure \(in real time\) the total bio load, which forms the baseline for subsequent scans. After cleaning and with high\-efficiency particulate air \(HEPA\) filtration placed, InstaScope remeasures the total bio load to check it has been sufficiently reduced. The WIBS licence has enabled DetectionTek to raise $3.5m \(£3m\) in external investment and create 18 jobs \[ **5.3**\]. The company projects that income across the impact period and up to 31 December 2021 will total $5m \[ **5.3**\]. The licence also resulted in $420,000 \(£356,000\) in industry investment \(from US companies including Intel Corporation, Carrier Global and Clorox\) for research at the University of Colorado Boulder to further evaluate and optimise the technology \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **Wider societal and economic impact via use of WIBS technology by customers of DMT and DetectionTek, and academic research groups** 

 Individual contractors and large companies have benefitted from the availability of DetectionTek’s InstaScope instrument. ServiceMaster is a Fortune 1000 company that provides residential and commercial services. It has 13,000 employees and a franchise network that independently employs over 33,000 additional people. The operations manager for ServiceMaster National Capital Restoration \(NCR\) described InstaScope in 2017 as a technological advancement that has ‘ *changed an entire industry*’ \[ **5.4**\]. He wrote in an article on ServiceMaster NCR’s website: *“The InstaScope has taken the average downtime and loss of use on a mold project from 8 days to 1.5. The positive impact on project timetables and client perception is immeasurable and is borne out by numerous case studies* \[ **5.4**\].’ 

 The nature and significance of the benefits to end users is indicated through DetectionTek’s client testimonials. The CEO of a ServiceMaster franchise in Newark wrote: *‘The InstaScope has changed my career. I have gone from a commodity service provider to a trusted consultant and expert for my customers* \[ **5.5**\] *.’* The owner of SME Indoor Air Quality Services wrote: *‘The ability to have real\-time information and evaluate every room has changed the way I conduct assessments. I am able to focus on problem areas immediately, without the need for a return visit* \[ **5.5**\].’ As an indication of the significance of the downstream economic impact of the WIBS technology, one ServiceMaster franchise employing 50\-60 people generates an annual turnover of around $15m of which over $1m \(£755,000\) is attributed directly to InstaScope billing \[ **5.3**\]. 

 In response to Covid\-19, DetectionTek worked with hotels, cultural institutions and government agencies to help them return to activity post lockdown \[ **5.6**\]. The company then made schools their strategic priority. In the summer of 2020 InstaScope funded \($200k\) a pilot with the University of Colorado Boulder in Denver Public Schools \(operates 207 schools in the county\) to validate classroom sanitisation. As a result, Denver Public Schools made a formal commitment to purchase instruments for use in around 6,000 classrooms \[ **5.3**\]. 

 \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] \[ **5.7**\]. The WIBS technology has been cited in around 280 peer\-reviewed journals authored by researchers using the instrument in bioaerosol studies, having purchased it from DMT. Interviews with researchers on some of these projects have revealed further examples of impact *beyond the research community*. 

 <ins>Informing Irish and UK government approaches</ins> <ins>to pollen</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>spore</ins> <ins>and green waste</ins> <ins>monitoring</ins>: UH researchers worked with Professor John Sodeau at University College Cork \(UCC\) to adapt the WIBS for biological spore and pollen monitoring. In Killarney National Park, in collaboration with Ireland’s Environmental Protection Agency \(EPA\), Sodeau found that the impact of fungal spores in indoor areas \(e.g. workers’ cabins\) can be significant. He also identified the risk of public exposure. The EPA published a report on the findings, which recommended continuous monitoring of green waste facilities \[ **5.8**\]. Following on from this project, the EPA and Met Eireann invested €500,000 in the development of a daily pollen forecast for Ireland using WIBS \[ **5.9**\]. The UK Environment Agency notes that driving down people’s exposure to particulate matter in order to protect their health represents a ‘ *major challenge*’ for government. It uses the WIBS technology at biowaste sites to ‘ *pinpoint precisely when spikes of bioaerosol emission are observed, enabling us to deduce the worst\-offending parts of the process \(some of which can be highly intermittent\), which we can then focus on mitigating*’ \[ **5.10**\]. 

 <ins>Informing health policy in Ireland</ins> <ins>to protect patients</ins>: In 2016, evidence was published to show that hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide could be at risk from a deadly bacterial infection \( *Mycobacterium chimaera*\) linked to aerosols from a heater\-cooler unit used during cardiac surgery. This medical device is an essential part of life\-saving surgeries as it helps keep a patient’s organs at a specific temperature during the operation. Twenty\-eight cases were confirmed in England alone, leading to 15 deaths. The WIBS was used as part of a case\-finding investigation for Ireland’s Health Service Executive by Professor Michael Prentice of University College Cork \[ **5.11**\]. He concluded that one specific model of heater\-cooler device did indeed produce aerosols in normal operation and therefore carried an infection risk; it was subsequently removed from hospitals in Ireland. Prentice had previously used WIBS for source investigation in an operating theatre that was failing microbial air testing, finding that automatically flushing taps in the scrubs sinks were producing aerosols reaching the operating table, and that redesign of the operating theatre was required. In the Covid\-19 pandemic he also used WIBS to validate the effectiveness of an aerosol control tent and a suction device promoted to reduce biological aerosols capable of transmission of SARS\-CoV2 \[ **5.11**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 LGBTQ people often remain invisible in heritage/cultural institutions, which can result in a decreased sense of community and pride. The general public frequently lack opportunities to improve their understanding of gender and sexual diversity. Funke’s research has addressed these problems by building new collaborations with major LGBTQ organisations and heritage/cultural institutions. Her work on histories of gender and sexuality, and her development of innovative models of co\-working with LGBTQ artists, organisations and communities, have had profound impacts, including: 

-  Enabling new creative collaborations and generating new artistic LGBTQ outputs. 

-  Improving the life chances and wellbeing of LGBTQ people. 

-  Enhancing the work of LGBTQ organisations by developing new engagement practices that enable creative approaches to support stakeholders. 

-  Improving the visibility and public understanding of LGBTQ communities in the heritage and cultural sectors nationally and internationally.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Prof Funke’s research has pioneered new understandings of literary and sexological constructions of gender and sexuality in the period 1880\-1940. It has received support from the British Academy \(2012\-14\), AHRC \(2016\) and from the Wellcome Trust in the form of a major Joint Investigator Award for the *Rethinking Sexology* project \(2015\-21\) and a subsequent Research Enrichment Award for the *Transformations* project \(2018\-20\), which Funke directs as Joint PI with Prof Kate Fisher. Funke’s in\-depth archival research on LGBTQ modernist writers like Radclyffe Hall, H.D., Bryher, Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville\-West, has explored previously overlooked intersections between lesbian, bisexual, transgender and heterosexual identities \[ **3.1**, **3.2**, **3.3**\].  It has expanded understandings of literary modernism by revealing how LGBTQ authors drew critically and creatively on sexological knowledge to articulate diverse models of gender and sexuality, thus offering rich insights into the diverse ways in which individuals can understand their own and other people’s gender and sexual identities. 

 Funke’s research on the *Rethinking Sexology* project has demonstrated that sexology \(ca. 1880\-1940\) was an interdisciplinary project shaped by diverse forms of knowledge, including literature, history, anthropology and sociology. As part of this major six\-year project, Funke and Fisher have led a team of three post\-doctoral fellows and a PhD student to offer the first sustained examination of the interdisciplinary history of sexology. Showing that sexologists drew on various non\-medical forms of knowledge, Funke’s individual and collaborative research has demonstrated that sexological constructions of gender and sexuality were far richer and more unstable than has previously been assumed \[ **3.4**, **3.5**, **3.6**\]. By revealing the complexities of sexological knowledge and examining how people in the past engaged with sexology, this research has enabled new critical thinking about medical and scientific authority, diagnostic categories and LGBTQ identities past and present. 

 Funke’s research on modernist literature and the history of sexology has led to significant funding for a series of follow\-on impact projects, which Funke has directed in collaboration with leading LGBTQ organisations \(Gendered Intelligence, Intercom Trust, YAY Cornwall, X\-Plore Youth, Exeter Pride\), heritage/cultural organisations \(British Film Institute, National Trust, Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter, Wellcome Collection\) and creative artists. Through these partnerships, Funke has demonstrated that her historical research provides powerful tools to enable LGBTQ individuals in the present to articulate their own views on gender and sexuality, and to enable broader publics to challenge damaging assumptions about LGBTQ communities. 

 The Wellcome\-Trust funded *Transvengers* \(2104\-15\), *Orlando: The Queer Element* \(2016\-17\) and *Transformations* \(2018\-20\) projects, and the National Lottery Heritage\-funded *Queering the Museum* project \(2018\-21\) share a commitment to processes of engaged research and co\-production through which LGBTQ people are empowered not only to gain an understanding of sexuality and gender in the past, but also to articulate their own insights and to share these with wider publics through creative outputs. Funke has collaborated with creative artists, dramaturgs, performers, LGBTQ organisations and heritage organisation across the country to develop these innovative methods of engaging LGBTQ communities and the broader public with her historical findings.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 1\) Enabling new creative collaborations and artistic LGBTQ outputs 

 Funke’s research has directly shaped and led to commissions for a wide range of innovative creative works, providing support and promotion for artists and performers who are LGBTQ and/or engage with LGBTQ themes in their work. These creative outputs were developed through a process of collaborative engagement with Funke’s research on sexology and modernist literature. The creatives enhanced their practice and generated new outputs that reflect diverse LGBTQ experiences past and present. Funke was a core collaborator on the Wellcome Trust\-funded *Orlando: The Queer Element* project \(2016\-17\), led by arts company Clay & Diamond, which resulted in a new immersive performance inspired by Virginia Woolf’s *Orlando*. Aimed at secondary school pupils and the general public, it encouraged audiences to explore sexuality and gender. It was performed at the BFI in London and eight times at the National Trust’s Knole and Hanbury Hall. Funke facilitated workshops at each \[ **5.1**\]. 



 In 2014\-2015, Funke collaborated with artist Jason Barker and Gendered Intelligence, a leading UK charity for transgender youth, on the *Transvengers* comic on trans history and the history of sexology. The comic was co\-created by Barker and young trans people through roleplay utilising Funke’s research. It was displayed as part of the major Wellcome Institute of Sexology exhibition \(2014\-15\). Funke, Barker and Gendered Intelligence subsequently extended their formal collaboration through the *Transformations* project \(2018\-20\). Barker worked with Funke, the *Rethinking Sexology* team and a new group of young trans and gender\-diverse people from Gendered Intelligence to write a performance entitled *Adventures in Time and Gender*, a time\-traveling journey based on Funke’s research on trans and queer history. This process enabled Barker to develop new skills in socially engaged creative practice and to engage with historical materials, which have particular value for trans communities. As Barker stated: ‘Feeling connected to something that was very ancient was very powerful. That this \[trans identity\] is nothing new.’ \[ **5.2**\] Launched in October 2020, the drama was produced by Barker in collaboration with other leading trans creatives and performers, such as director Krishna Istha, and released as a three\-part podcast \[ **5.2**\]. 

 In 2016, Funke worked with award\-winning artist Natalie McGrath to develop a new performance based on Funke’s research on Radclyffe Hall; it was staged as part of the AHRC Being Human Festival at the Exeter Phoenix \(November 2016\). 

 *‘To engage with this material and Jana \[Funke\]’s expertise has been a new way of working for me. It allowed me to develop my voice as a lesbian writer in a new way, or even a gender\-fluid writer has emerged on the page, bringing about new resonances and possibilities in my work for the future in style and content.’* – Natalie McGrath \[ **5.3**\] 

 McGrath was empowered to collaborate with other academics, leading to a commission to write a new play on LGBTQ\+ lives and loneliness for the Northcott Theatre/Wellcome Centre for Cultures & Environments of Health in Exeter \[ **5.3**\]. Funke and McGrath’s initial collaboration led to the *Queering the Museum* project \(2019\-21\), which they jointly direct and which utilises creative methods of engagement developed by Funke on previous projects. This enabled McGrath to take up a new paid role as RAMM’s writer in residence, writing an original LGBTQ heritage piece in dialogue with Funke’s research and the museum collections. Funke and McGrath have also commissioned a series of creative responses to RAMM’s collections \(by Charice Bhardwaj, Carina Miles, Caleb Parkin and Oren Shoesmith\), thus providing new opportunities for other LGBTQ artists to develop their practice and reveal otherwise invisible LGBTQ histories \[ **5.4**\]. 

 **2\) Improving the life chances and wellbeing of LGBTQ people** 

 Funke has empowered young LGBTQ people to engage with historical research and collaborate with creative practitioners to share their insights on gender and sexuality with wider audiences. The ca. 100 individuals who participated in the *Orlando*, *Transvengers, Transformations* and *Queering the Museum* projects benefited from increased pride and confidence and a decreased sense of social isolation and loneliness \[ **5.1**, **5.2**, **5.4, 5.5**\]. Participants in *Orlando*, which engaged young people through performance, reported positive outcomes on their sense of self: ‘This mattered today, because it’s one step closer to showing that <ins> **I**</ins> matter.’ \[ **5.1**\] 

 The *Transformations* project involved a series of in\-depth workshops over the course of one year, using performance, collage/drawing and creative writing. Its independent evaluation has shown substantial and often life\-changing positive impacts on the ca. 20 participants’ sense of empowerment, identity and belonging \[ **5.2**\]. They commented on how learning about trans people in the past made them ‘feel a sense of belonging that I’ve never felt before’, that simply ‘seeing that we have existed is really validating and special’ \[ **5.2**\]. They also developed new skills in research, creativity, curation and performance, providing transferable skills and important career experience. One participant stated: ‘The fact that I can now say I've been part of a writers’ room for a play that's going to be made should be an enormous help professionally.’ The project enabled some participants to make particularly life\-changing decisions. One young person stated: ‘I have been referred to GIC \[Gender Identity Clinic\] and came out to my family because I was motivated by the workshops.’ \[ **5.2**\] Trans people who listened to the podcast resulting from the *Transformations* project said it made them feel ‘proud’, ‘seen’, ‘accepted’ and ‘affirmed’ \[ **5.2**\]. LGBTQ\+ people who engaged with *Queering the Museum* reported similar feelings of affirmation and validation \[ **5.4**\]. According to Gendered Intelligence, the collaboration with Funke ‘demonstrated the value of historical and creative approaches for young people’s wellbeing and life chances’ and ‘provides the foundation for trans and gender\-questioning people to find a deep sense of pride’ \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **3\) Enhancing the work of LGBTQ organisations through new engagement practices** 

 Funke’s work has significantly improved the way that a range of LGBTQ organisations, including award\-winning national charities like Gendered Intelligence and the Intercom Trust, engage with their stakeholders. In partnership with Funke, they have developed new historical and creative methods of engagement. For Gendered Intelligence, the success of *Transvengers* led to the large\-scale *Transformations* project, making it possible to develop the *Adventures in Time and Gender* drama podcast and website through collaboration between young trans people, artists and researchers. As a result, Gendered Intelligence staff felt inspired to use historical materials when working with young trans people or delivering trans awareness training \[ **5.2**\]. Since 2018, Funke has also worked with X\-Plore Youth and YAY Cornwall to engage young LGBTQ\+ people with LGBTQ\+ history through regular workshops \[ **5.4**\]. LGBTQ\+ organisations have repeatedly showcased their collaborations with Funke to influence best practice across the sector. For instance, the CEO of Gendered Intelligence, Dr Jay Stewart, repeatedly highlighted *Transvengers* at national events and in publications, stating that it successfully ‘raise\[d\] awareness about transgender lives, and \[…\] generate\[d\] debate about gender identity.’ \[ **5.5**\]. 

 In 2020, Funke’s work on *Queering the Museum* enabled new partnerships between RAMM, Intercom Trust and Exeter Pride, inspiring these leading regional LGBTQ organisations to embed historical and creative forms of engagement in their work. According to Simon Bowkett, co\-chair of Exeter Pride, one of the biggest Pride organisations in the country, ‘our collaboration with Funke and McGrath has opened up new ways of reaching out to and providing support for LGBTQ\+ communities, and provided added resilience and adaptability to the Pride movement itself’ \[ **5.6**\]. Andy Hunt, CEO of the Intercom Trust, the largest LGBTQ charity in the South West, stated: ‘Our work with Funke is helping us to explore and develop new ways of engaging with and providing support for LGBTQ\+ people.’ \[ **5.6**\] 

 **4\) Improving the visibility and public understanding of LGBTQ communities in the heritage and cultural sectors** 

 Funke’s collaborative research with LGBTQ communities, artists and organisations has enabled cultural institutions and heritage sites across the UK to share insights about gender and sexual diversity with broader audiences, improving acceptance of LGBTQ people \[ **5.1**; **5.4**; **5.5**, **5.7**, **5.8, 5.9**\]. Her research featured in the major *Institute of Sexology* exhibition at Wellcome Collection in London \(2014\-15\). The exhibition attracted more than 220,000 visitors and received broad international media coverage \[ **5.7**\]. As part of the accompanying event programme, Funke shared her research at events in London and Manchester, reaching ca. 300 participants \[ **5.9**\]. The *Transvengers* comic was displayed both as part of the exhibition and online, where it has been viewed more than 20,000 times \[ **5.5**\]. Viewers commented that the comic made them ‘ask serious questions about how we treat those outside of heteronormativity and the gender binary’ \[ **5.5**\]. Dr Simon Chaplin, Director of Culture & Society at the Wellcome Trust, in his keynote address at the National Alliance for Museums, Health & Wellbeing Conference \(2016\), highlighted *Transvengers* as a key initiative that allowed Wellcome to reach more diverse audiences and improve participants’ wellbeing \[ **5.5**\]. 

 Funke’s work on the *Orlando* project allowed the National Trust to ‘open up our spaces to new experiences, audiences and perspectives’ \[ **5.1**\]. The independent evaluation of the *Orlando* project, which reached 316 students and 337 adults, demonstrated that it achieved significant changes in attendees’ understanding and respect of LGBTQ people \[ **5.1**\]. RAMM testifies that *Queering the Museum* has allowed it to reach more diverse audiences, ‘expanding its engagement with LGBTQ\+ communities, co\-creating alternative interpretations of the collections and identifying stories from people that are underrepresented as a result of intolerance’ \[ **5.4**\]. In May 2019, RAMM launched the Rainbow Trail, developed by Funke and McGrath together with young LGBTQ\+ people from X\-Plore Youth. It reframed objects on permanent display to reveal neglected LGBTQ\+ heritage and is available as both a physical and digital trail. In addition, in November 2020, four new LGBTQ creative responses to the RAMM’s collections were shared online, reaching more than 600 people by the end of the year. Viewers stated that the outputs significantly increased their understanding of LGBTQ\+ culture \[ **5.4**\]. The *Adventures in Time and Gender* podcast has reached more than 2,000 listeners across Europe, Australia, North and South America. The project website, with its additional historical and creative resources, has been accessed more than 12,000 times \[ **5.2**\]. As such, Funke’s work with Wellcome Collections, the National Trust, RAMM and other partners has significantly improved the visibility of LGBTQ history and communities.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The spin\-out company **Symetrica** was created in 2002 to translate novel methods of high\-energy radiation detection developed at the University of Southampton \(UoS\), originally for the ESA’s INTEGRAL Space Telescope, to applications in the homeland security market. Symetrica products drive security standards and result in benefits to both the economy and public safety/wellbeing. 

 Now an established world\-leader in its field, the company has shown strong growth over the impact period: Between 2014 and 2019, employee numbers increased from 26 to 75 \(50 UK and 25 US\). Between 2016 and 2019, Symetrica experienced a 74% rise in annual sales to GBP11m, earning it 60th place in the Sunday Times list of 100 fastest growing technology companies. Symetrica’s UK market has grown rapidly, and the company exports to more than 10 countries, including the USA, Hong Kong and the Netherlands. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Symetrica’s formation and current product lines derive directly from past and ongoing research streams in astronomy at UoS. Symetrica’s speciality is the use of both novel detector readout and spectral deconvolution to provide world\-leading identification of radioisotopes in a wealth of compact and \(relatively\) low\-cost systems. 

 The underpinning research may broadly be grouped into **detection**, **imaging** and **data analysis** techniques, much of which is based on research performed as development for the European Space Agency’s INTEGRAL space telescope – essentially a very large radiation detector capable of both imaging and high\-resolution spectrum measurement. 

 Research undertaken in 2000\-2002 by Dr Matthew Dallimore and Dr Grant Crossingham, while PPARC enterprise fellows within the UoS Astronomy group, made fundamental improvements to the spectral performance of small scintillation counters, which enabled the design of the detectors underpinning the formation of Symetrica. The research, in collaboration with Dr David Ramsden who had previously worked at UoS until his retirement in 1996, included the use of spectral deconvolution to reconstruct spectra from low\-resolution and lower\-performance detectors \[ **3.1**\], and the design of optimised detector geometries to improve spectral performance \[ **3.2**\]. These enabled the detector to accurately identify threat materials hidden in heavily shielded containers, using a compact system that could be operated in a portal and in a handheld detector as a second layer of surveillance. Dallimore, Crossingham and Ramsden went on to found Symetrica in December 2002. 

 At the same time Professor Tony Bird led improvements to the operations of ESA’s INTEGRAL telescope post\-launch. These included the use of complex simulation and computer response modelling to mitigate the effect of complicated and imperfect detectors \[ **3.3**\] and the use of tagged calibration sources to provide real\-time continuous gain stabilisation without increasing detector background \[ **3.4**\]. Both are crucial in operating detectors in real\-world scenarios, and were a fundamental component of Symetrica’s early *Discovery Technology®* for spectral deconvolution and radiation isotope identification. 

 **Post\-INTEGRAL detector research** 

 Following the INTEGRAL launch, there was a need for radiation detectors for space applications to develop in terms of size, robustness and efficiency. On the other hand, commercial drivers – scalability of production, stability of supply and low cost – were becoming more relevant in space where the emphasis was moving towards faster and cheaper deployment. In this context, Bird led research on novel detector techniques between 2004 and 2011, starting with an investigation into spectroscopy using plastic scintillators as a low\-cost alternative for large area detectors. Plastic scintillators produce a small signal, and were previously considered impractical for spectroscopic measurements of radiation energy. New readout methods and deconvolution algorithms were developed to overcome these problems. Bird then led a DTI/EPSRC grant \[ **G2**\] which studied the use of Silicon photomultipliers \(SiPMs\) in radiation sensors. These were shown to provide a more robust replacement for the traditional photomultiplier \(PMTs\), and required lower power and voltage to operate. 

 **Post\-INTEGRAL imaging research** 

 A strong research effort has been towards directional and imaging radiation detectors for the gamma\-ray waveband. Coded apertures allow imaging of high\-energy radiation that cannot be imaged by conventional lens\- or mirror\-based systems. They employ mathematical image reconstruction methods to estimate the radiation source distribution from a shadow of a complex pattern of radiation\-opaque elements \(the ‘mask’\). The techniques for analysing coded mask data have matured considerably thanks to the in\-flight experience gained with ESA’s INTEGRAL and NASA’s Swift telescopes, and research has continued into the design and application of coded apertures in a number of areas of value to terrestrial applications. This programme of research was funded initially by STFC as INTEGRAL Post\-Launch Support \(PLS\), which ended in 2010, and then more recently by responses to more applied funding streams. 

 Collaborations between UoS and Symetrica on bespoke applications such as the Stonehenge imager \[ **G3**\] demonstrated the theoretical advantages of stand\-off imaging systems over proximity ones \[ **3.5**\]. 

 **Data analysis, image reconstruction and processing** 

 Two key techniques were developed as part of a KTP collaboration between University of Southampton and Symetrica \(2016\-2018\) \[ **G5**\]. Firstly, methods for co\-aligning optical and gamma\-ray images were shown allowing a user to quickly identify the source of radiation in an image. In addition, Bird extended a method used in INTEGRAL for cleaning of coded mask images to remove imaging artefacts in the case where no a\-priori knowledge of the source position was available. This method has been successfully demonstrated with the spectral analysis and Symetrica Discovery algorithms to allow location and isotope identification of multiple sources in an imager field of view. 

 **Advanced coded mask image reconstruction** 

 Development of image reconstruction algorithm for a moving imaging system \(2018\-\). This is being applied to an INTEGRAL slew survey for astronomy \[ **3.6**\] and is essential for scanning or hand\-held imaging systems. 

 The most recent development is of near\-field 3\-D imaging systems based on pixellated detector plane technologies \(2018\-\), which will be essential for future medical applications of the coded aperture methods.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1 Background to **Symetrica** and commercial success since 2014** 

 Symetrica Ltd \(now Symetrica Security Ltd\) was spun out from the School of Physics and Astronomy at UoS in December 2002 to commercialise proprietary, high\-performance gamma\-ray spectroscopy capabilities, originally developed for the ESA’s INTEGRAL Space Telescope and redesigned in 2000\-2002 for real\-world scenarios. Its US sister company, Symetrica Inc., was founded in Maynard, Massachusetts in 2005. 

 The company has shown strong growth since 2014 and is now an established world\-leader in its field of homeland security, marketing handheld radioisotope identifiers \(RIIDs\), cargo scanning portals, and bespoke radiation detection solutions. Customers include the Home Office’s Office for Security and Counter\-terrorism \(OSCT\) and private companies such as Tata steel. Its technology is now in use in many countries including UK, US, Holland, Belgium, Finland, South America, Middle East, Hong Kong, Israel and Italy. Between 2014 and 2019, overall Symetrica employee numbers increased from 26 to 75 \(50 in the UK and 25 in the US\). \[ **5.1**\] 

 Between 2016 and 2019, Symetrica experienced a 74% rise in annual sales to £11m, earning it 60<sup>th</sup> place in the Sunday Times Hiscox Tech Track 100 list of fastest growing technology companies \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **4.2 US Department of Homeland Security and **Radseeker** 

 In 2006 Symetrica partnered with Smiths Detection Inc., a world\-leading provider of detection systems for X\-rays, explosives and traces of radioactive materials, and won a contract to develop next\-generation radiation detection and identification systems for the US Department of Homeland Security's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office \(DNDO\). A flagship product was the **RadSeeker**, approved by the DNDO in 2011 as its primary radiological handheld detector device. These devices are based on *Discovery Technology* developed by Crossingham and Dallimore, working on the principle of proximity to the radioactive material using a combination of sensors to determine nature of the radioisotope. 

 In January 2016 the DNDO renewed its commitment to RadSeeker with a five\-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity \(IDIQ\) contract. A GBP10,000,000 order followed in September 2018 \[ **5.3**\], with Symetrica completing shipment of their 3000<sup>th</sup> RadSeeker that year \[ **5.1**\] In 2020 Symetrica received a USD7m 3yr contract to update and enhance the devices deployed in the field . 

 **4.3 Product lines based on SiPMs and plastic scintillator: **Verifinder** 

 SiPM and large\-area plastic scintillator technologies developed under \[ **G2**\] continue to underpin many Symetrica products including the Radiation Portal Monitors \(plastic\) and He3\-free neutron detector in Verifinder RIID \(SiPM\). Verifinder was released in 2016 as the successor to Radseeker, and is sold in several variants including Verifinder handheld, Verifinder backpack and Verifinder Drone. \[ **5.1, 5.4**\]. 

 Since its launch in 2016, the Verifinder system and its variants have been sold across European \(Finland, Belgium, Holland, Italy\) and US \(National Nuclear Security Administration \(NNSA\)\) markets. The US military use Verifinder backpacks, currently being supplied via a multi\-year contract, 

 In May 2016, Symetrica launched Neutron Vest, a wearable system that has a partial direction\-finding capability using SiPMs for neutron detection \[ **5.5**\]. 

 A new mobile system currently in production by Symetrica uses both tagged radiation sources for gain stabilisation \[ **3.4**, **3.5**\] and large\-area plastic\-based neutron detectors. 

 **4.4 Deployment of enhanced portal systems** 

 Symetrica’s Radiation Portal Monitors deploy large area detectors and Discovery Technology to provide class\-leading performance. They have benefited from continual improvements on the original gamma\-ray detector to offer a >75% nuisance alarm reduction and improved isotope identification capability compared to other available systems. 

 Portals are now deployed at ports and airports around the world. Since 2017, four Symetrica portals have been deployed at the Tata steel site in Port Talbot in order to screen incoming radioactive material for signs of accidental melting, which has been a major problem for the metals reprocessing industry \[ **5.1**\]. Apart from improved worker safety, the main benefit has been the substantial financial savings due to the prevention of temporary shutdown of the mill, which would incur costs relating to decontamination, waste disposal and lost revenue. US steel mills have incurred costs averaging USD8 to 10 million as a result of these events and, in one case, the cost was USD23 million \[ **5.6**\]. 

 The high performance of Symetrica systems in the identification of illicit radioactive materials compared to Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials \(NORM\) has led to **changes in international standards and expectations** stated in procurement specifications. In particular, nuisance alarm rates \(alerts on NORM\) have been dramatically reduced from 3% to 0.1% in the latest specification released in 2017 which explicitly states the expected technology is large\-area plastic scintillator spectrometers. 

 Deployment of improved security portals at UK ports has a dual impact. Firstly, it leads to **improved transit rate at ports** with obvious benefits to UK economy. The reduction to 0.1% of nuisance alarms should be seen in the context of the global use of containers: 616.7 million containers passed through ports in 2018 so a 2.9% reduction means 18 million fewer unnecessary container inspections. Better selectivity leads to lower detection thresholds, improved sensitivity to detection \(without additional nuisance/false alerts\) and provides **improved national security** via improved detection rates for genuine contraband. 

 **4.5 Embedding new company capability for imaging systems** 

 The development of imaging systems was enabled through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(2016\-2018, Innovate UK KTP010399\) aimed at embedding the design skills within the industry, and hence creating a long\-term capability for the industrial partner, providing long\-term impact far beyond the benefits of the initial product designs. Bird provided a series of seminars and workshops to the development teams at Symetrica. The KTP was rated outstanding by Innovate UK \[ **5.7**\]. The KTP Associate, Dr Callum Shand, was seconded to Symetrica to act as the focus of the knowledge transfer, and was subsequently employed by Symetrica at the end of the KTP and leads development of the new imaging product lines. At the end of the KTP, Symetrica had an embedded capability, through the use of computer simulation methods, to design imaging systems for specific roles, quantify their performance and develop data analysis software for tasks. Validated modelling techniques for use in imager design allow for faster instrument design with much reduce prototyping costs \[ **5.8**\]. 

 Dallimore, now CTO at Symetrica, stated: “The KTP is an excellent opportunity to reinforce the links between ourselves and the excellent faculty members at the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Symetrica’s strategy is to push the boundaries of detection and identification of radioactive threats for Homeland Security applications. It is imperative that we remain at the cutting edge in our field; this KTP provides Symetrica with the opportunity to do just that, as well as move into the Nuclear Medicine market.” \[ **5.8**\] 

 **4.6 Informing company strategy \- medical imaging** 

 In July 2020, a SPRINT collaboration between Symetrica, the University of Southampton and Southampton General Hospital was set up to translate the imaging technology for medical imaging applications \[ **5.9**\]. Symetrica expects to achieve a 5% market penetration within 3 years rising to 15% within 5 years. Assuming the gamma\-ray camera accounts for 25% of the system price, this would lead to a turnover of the order of GBP30,000,000 per year. \[ **5.1**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This research impacted upon the increased inclusion of athletes with intellectual disabilities \(ID\) in elite sport, and made this sustainable through structural and policy changes. Firstly, our research contributed to new protocols concerning Paralympic eligibility and classification which has led to more athletes with ID competing at this elite level and in a wider range of events. Secondly, our research has led to competition classes being broadened to include those with greater intellectual impairments, including those with Down Syndrome, enabling them to compete at international levels. Thirdly, the impact of greater inclusion has changed attitudes, increased professional competencies and unlocked further investment. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 This research was led by Professor Jan Burns in Applied Psychology, working with Dr Fergal Jones and Psychology research students *,* in collaboration with the International Paralympic Committee \(IPC\), Virtus \(World Disability Impairment Sport\), and Special Olympics *.* 

 **Demonstrating impact of intellectual disabilities \(ID\) on cognitive skills related to sports performance** Athletes were misrepresented as having ID at the 2000 Sydney Paralympics, resulting in this impairment group being removed from the Paralympic programmes in 2004 and2008, and only reinstated in the 2012 Games. Re\-inclusion required a more robust system of eligibility and sports classification. Whilst this classification framework was provisionally in place for London 2012 \(previous REF period\), it was fully developed to include additional events, endorsed by the IPC, who subsequently mandated all associated Sports Federations to follow it, in this REF period. This research was part of an international collaboration jointly funded by the IPC and the International Federation for Para\-athletes with Intellectual Impairments \(INAS now called Virtus\). For classification purposes our research needed to demonstrate how having ID impacted on sports performance and how this could be assessed in individual sports. We developed a psychometric battery to test ‘generic sports intelligence’, and ‘sport\-specific tests’ to show the impact of impaired cognitive skills on the technical and tactical requirements of specific events \(e.g. limitations in pacing\). Using between group comparisons \(ID vs non\-ID athletes\) the research demonstrated that specific cognitive skills were implicated in specific sports performance skills leading to reduced performance by ID athletes. The IPC\-endorsed, evidence\-based conceptual framework for ID athlete classification was derived from our research, which led to the re\-inclusion and expansion of opportunities for ID athletes in Paralympic competition and now underpins all IPC classification for ID athletes \( **R1**\). 

 **Developing a measure to underpin a performance classification system for ID athletes** 

 Virtus is the International Federation for athletes with ID and works closely with the IPC, who accept Virtus eligibility requirements i.e. if an athlete is deemed eligible by Virtus they are eligible for IPC classification as above. Virtus eligibility is a rigorous process of testing evidence of IQ, adaptive behaviour and age of onset against diagnostic criteria. This involves a panel of 30\+ expert psychologists across the world, managed by Professor Burns on behalf of Virtus. Currently, there is only one competition class in both Virtus and the Paralympics meaning that regardless of disability level, all ID athletes compete together. By investigating the relationship between ID and sports performance we aimed to establish how athletes with ID could be categorised into different competition classes. First we investigated the relationship between IQ scores, health status and athletic performance to demonstrate that a simple categorisation according to IQ would not work, as previous research had shown a non\-linear relationship between IQ and sports performance **.** A between\-groups design was used to investigate the relationship between global IQ scores, standardised individual sport performance scores and health status using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health checklist \(ICF\) **\(R2\)**. We confirmed that functional health status was a better predictor of sports performance than IQ, and that the lower sports performance of Down Syndrome \(DS\) athletes was due to their increased functional impairments. 

  

 The next study developed a more sensitive measure of overall functional health, with the aim of grouping athletes with a similar level of limitation to that experienced by athletes with DS into a class for more severely impaired athletes \(sports classification is based on overall functional impairment not on diagnosis\). To do this, we developed a bespoke measure from the ICF taxonomy **\(R3\)**, which showed that the ICF\-based questionnaire discriminated between three levels of performance, and could predict group membership for elite athletes with ID and athletes with DS. Extrapolating from the results of **R2** and **R3,** Virtus opened a new competition class II2 \- Significant impairment, allowing those ID athletes with greater impairments, including DS, to compete internationally. 

 **Demonstrating the benefits of increasing inclusion of ID athletes in sport** 

 We examined the impact of increasing access to sport for athletes with ID, on athlete well\-being and audience attitudes towards disability. A project commissioned by Special Olympics International \(SOI\) investigated the impact of engagement in organised sport on the well\-being of ID athletes.  A cross\-sectional design compared those involved in the Special Olympics \(SO\), with those involved informally in sport or not at all \( **R4**\). Those involved in sport had better self\-esteem, quality of life, and lower stress and, specifically, being involved in SO was a predictor of higher self\-esteem. 

  

 One of the outcomes of being involved in elite sport is that participants’ performances can be witnessed by billions of people through the media. More than 4.1 billion people watched the Rio 2016 Paralympics, making it the most viewed event in history. We investigated the impact of viewing the sports performance of disabled and non\-disabled athletes on the general public using a mixed randomised comparison design measuring implicit attitude change using Paralympic \(with ID athletes\) and Olympic footage \( **R5**\). Viewing both sorts of material positively impacted on the attitudes of the audience towards people with ID. A further longitudinal study pre and post the 2012 Paralympics demonstrated that exposure to Paralympic coverage impacted positively on in\-group norms about disabled people’s competence and improved intergroup contact quality among both disabled and non\-disabled participants \( **R6**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Increased Inclusion in elite sport for ID athletes** 

 Our research **\(R1\-3\)** has contributed to a new procedure for sports classification to allow ID athletes to enter Paralympic competition that has been adopted by the IPC for all ID athletes. The research has been described as having led to ‘ *setting the standards for eligibility and classification’* for ID athletes, by the Co\-ordinator of the IPC ID Classification Research Centre \( **S1**\). Following the implementation of a prototype that allowed the re\-inclusion of athletes into the London 2012 Paralympics, further evaluation and significant development \( **R1**\) extended implementation in the Rio 2016 Paralympics, with an increase of five additional events in swimming and athletics. Consequently, ID athletes can now compete in the Paralympic games and all qualifying events at Regional and International Championships. From 2013\-2020 this has included new access to 17 athletics, 9 swimming, and 5 world or regional IPC\-sanctioned events. In the London 2012 games,112 ID athletes competed from 12 nations, in Rio 2016 124 ID athletes competed from 16 nations, and for Tokyo there are 140 places available. Since 2013, over 1,089 athletes have completed the classification system, from 89 countries, and are now eligible for Paralympic competition, with increasing growth year\-on\-year. The IPC has mandated that all International Sports Federations should develop their athlete classification systems to include ID athletes, using the framework developed from our research. This work is nearly completed for Nordic skiing and ID skiers will now be included in the winter Paralympic programme after 2024, with rowing likely to follow. 

 International organisations working with ID athletes have also benefitted due to increased membership, reach and sustainability through income growth e.g. the CEO of Virtus comments *‘Such growth has been unprecedented and has seen our athlete reach more than double over the past 5 years ….*  *Virtus as an organisation has been strengthened, as have those organisations who are members of Virtus. This is both in terms of attracting additional revenue through membership, and through the links then being made with other organisations servicing this population.’ **\(**S2 **\).*  An example is Sport Inclusion Australia, who report ‘ *extended opportunities and pathways for athletes with an intellectual impairment within Athletics Australia, Swimming Australia and Table Tennis Australia due to the expansion in Paralympic events.’* \( **S3**\). 

 **Broadening inclusion in elite sport for ID** 

 Our research on the relationship between IQ, health and sports performance has provided the basis to widen competition classes at an international level from one to two, allowing those with more significant impairments to compete. This has made elite competition for ID athletes fairer and more representative, but also increased access to elite sporting opportunities for athletes with greater disabilities, especially those with Down Syndrome \(DS\). Previously, athletes with DS would be out\-performed by ID athletes without DS, and would not qualify for international competition. Our research informed the Virtus eligibility criteria to develop a new international class for competition \(II2\), significantly widening elite sporting opportunities for DS and more impaired ID athletes. The Virtus CEO testifies that this research ‘ *has resulted in a major step forward for intellectual impairment sport, increasing opportunities and raising the profile of those with more significant disabilities*. ‘\( **S2**\). As a result, 186 athletes with DS from 31 countries are now registered to compete internationally in Virtus events. The Virtus Global Games, the pinnacle of the ID sports calendar, occurs every four years and in 2019, 67 athletes with DS from 13 countries competed in this event for the first time. The CEO of the Global Games reported a 41% increase in country participation due to these increased pathways \( **S3**\). The father of a DS athlete commented that the impact of the new classification structure was ‘….. *allowing fair competitions, but beyond sports such achievements bring more justice, equality, good opportunities in our world*’ \( **S4**\). Resulting from the successful participation in the Global Games his son with DS was voted ‘ *all\-round sport personality of the year in Tuscany*’. 

 The new classification criteria have been adopted by other sports \(Taekwondo, Judo, Golf, Hockey, Equestrian, Athletics, Swimming\), resulting in widened inclusion of ID athletes. Organisations have been able to use this evidence of greater inclusion to then leverage increased competition opportunities, e.g.  the US Rowing Association have now adopted the new class for all events and described the new class as being ‘ *a key lever in getting US Rowing to include IDD as part of their recognized program.’* \(CEO Athletes without Limits, US\) **\(S5**\). 

 **Impact on attitudes, professional competencies and unlocking further investment** 

 The ability to place ID athletes on the highest sporting podiums performs an important function of changing attitudes **\(R6 & 7\)**. Referring to the impact of the inclusion of athletes with ID within the media, the IPC Chief Brand and Communications Officer described the consequent media and broadcast coverage as having *‘contributed to a seismic shift in attitudes’* toward athletes with ID and *‘a greater recognition of their achievements and undoubtedly attitude change.’*  \( **S6**\). In 2013, our classification research was chosen by the then Department of Trade and Investment as a case study to highlight collaborative partnerships and the impact of UK universities \( **S7**\). 

 Resulting from the research developing the new Virtus competition class, the Agitos Foundation \(the charitable arm of the IPC\) awarded Virtus two grants to build on the widening participation of the new classification system by delivering training in two economically\-disadvantaged regions. This training was delivered by Professor Burns in Egypt and Puerto Rico, in addition to five other nations who commissioned it directly during 2015\-2017. The impact of the workshops is demonstrated by the increase in athletes from these nations registered to compete, with 34 in total before, and in the year post\-delivery 124, with year on year growth \(prior to Covid\). The workshops resulted in over 120 psychologists, sports scientists and sports organisations developing competencies in this area. It also allowed psychologists to be trained as National Eligibility Officers \(NEO\), who then improved eligibility processes in their countries and provided training to others. This widened the reach of the training, including in harder\-to\-reach nations e.g. the Mexican NEO reported sharing this work with Colombia, Dominican Republic and Guatemala \( **S8**\). This NEO reported that the training based on our research had facilitated her organisation to ‘ *create platforms for objective, evaluation, generate participation, community among the athletes, increase opportunities’*, and to develop a national plan of sport for ID athletes. To further increase access, the eligibility guidance has been translated into Spanish, Chinese and Arabic. 

 The combination of increased pathways, broader inclusion and enhanced educational material has enabled organisations to gain recognition and, as a result, new sources of funding e.g. ‘ *Not only have National sport organisations in Australia commenced inclusion of events for the II2 classification, but it is also easier to gain financial support from Governments for their involvement, now they are recognised by the National bodies.*’ \(CEO Sport Inclusion Australia, \( **S3**\)

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Kalpouzos clarified the liability of state agents and contractors at migrant processing centres \(MPCs\) for crimes against humanity, under current statutory and case law of the International Criminal Court \(ICC\).  It led to the following impact: \(1\) A <ins>change to the public perception of the role of the ICC</ins> in the UK and Australia. The public feels that mistreatment of migrants at MPCs could be punishable by ICC prosecution \(2\) A <ins>benefit to the economy</ins> in Australia and the UK. Charitable giving to legal aid charities capable of migrant\-repatriation from MPCs has increased, partly due to research \(3\) A <ins>change to public policy</ins> in Australia and within key intergovernmental organisations. Influenced by the underpinning research, the Australian Parliament, UN bodies and the ICC have concluded that the ICC can designate MPC malpractice a crime against humanity. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The primary motivation for this research was the refugee crisis in Europe that followed the onset of civil war in Syria in March 2011. By December 2014, a total 4,000,000 had registered as refugees. This significant new displaced population put immense pressure on countries along primary migration corridors e.g. Turkey and Greece. Not adequately prepared to handle this dramatic rise in migration, these states hastily constructed MPCs at their borders, which soon became notorious for unsanitary conditions and institutionalised mistreatment of migrants. 

 In this context, Dr Kalpouzos investigated whether the nature of migrant processing in detention centres might, in itself, constitute a crime against humanity according to existing ICC jurisprudence. Funded by an Institute for Global Law and Policy \(IGLP\) collaborative grant in January 2015, Dr Kalpouzos was one of six academics working on the project, which spanned Europe and the USA, and worked in German, French, Greek and Finnish as well as in their common language, English. 

 Between January and June 2015 Dr Kalpouzos and a close collaborator at Georgetown University reviewed more than 150 documents including the ICC’s founding instrument \(the *Rome Statute*\), more than half of ICC’s 44 decided cases, and a further 124 documents including judgments from other courts and academic and practitioner texts. They applied their findings to reported incidents of mistreatment in Greek MPCs and published this work in June 2015 \[3.1\]. Following this, Dr Kalpouzos analysed a further 9 ICC cases and 160 documentary resources to incorporate cases along three other principal migration corridors: Italy\-Libya, US\-Mexico and Australia\-Indonesia.  This work was written up and published in April 2020 \[3.2\]. Overall a central key insight emerged from this body of work: 

  

 <ins>Key Finding 1:</ins> 

 Because of the ICC’s extensive record of prosecuting cases of violence in Africa as “crimes against humanity” \(e.g. late 2000 cases against Darfur militants responsible for death tolls in the 100,000\), in the West, by 2015 *,* <ins>the general public had ceased to see the ICC as a deterrent against so\-called ‘banal’ crimes against humanity</ins> \- e.g. systemic violence at MPCs \- by Western actors. However, notwithstanding public opinion, existing ICC law at that time <ins>already implied liability for crimes against humanity, in cases of detainee abuse</ins>, for both MPC staff and their political overseers, in any ICC signatory state. 

 In parallel with Dr Kalpouzos’ research, in May 2016 Stanford Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic \(IHRC\) – a faculty\-led student advocacy initiative – undertook more than 70 interviews with former detainees of two Australian MPCs. Dr Kalpouzos and the co\-author of his June 2015 paper assisted this 15\-faculty team as expert advisors.  They oversaw both the analysis of the interviews and, by combining this evidence with the results of their theoretical analysis, the compilation of a 115\-page report structured according to their 2015 findings \[3.3\].  This report contributed a second important finding to the body of research underpinning the three impacts: 

 <ins>Key Finding 2</ins>: 

 Combined with evidence, the research’s theoretical framework <ins>produced a viable case for a crimes against humanity prosecution of MPC staff and their political backers within the current ICC framework</ins> *.* 

 On 14 February 2017, Dr Kalpouzos and the academic experts brought together by the IHRC team submitted a report \(hereafter the communiqué\) to the ICC, officially requesting that the Office of the Prosecutor open a formal investigation into migrant processing on Australia’s Indonesian border. 

 The overall body of research which underpins the three impacts described below was a global effort undertaken by academics, legal practitioners and other stakeholders from the full cross\-section of society.  However, these two key findings, contributed by Dr Kalpouzos, have together made a distinct and significant contribution to the field of ICC accountability for MPC agents.  As outlined below, both ideas, exploited by numerous groups and individuals since publication, have significantly influenced how society understands the role of the ICC. This change of perspective has subsequently impacted both the economy and public policy in ways that are also underpinned by Dr Kalpouzos’ findings.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The first of the three impacts of the underpinning research concerns a change to society. Public discourse concerning migrant processing was enriched by introducing the concept of ICC liability for state actors. This evolution in public discourse to include ICC liability for crimes against humanity in MPCs is evidenced by a significant shift in the reporting of ICC cases in the UK press following publication of the communiqué in February 2017. 

 Following a London press conference on 13 February 2017, three of the UK’s ten national newspapers – *The Guardian*, *Financial Times \(FT\)* and the *Daily Express* – ran stories based on the research findings in their online editions.  The *Evening Standard* also covered the communiqué’s release. These stories communicated the principles in the research key findings \(see e.g. \[5.1\]\). *The* *Guardian* and *Daily Express* benefitted by weaving the findings into their regular coverage of Australia’s MPCs.  The *Standard* saw a 50% increase in its annual output covering Australian migrant processing following their article on the communiqué. 

 The change in practice of the *FT* is most striking. In the four years before they covered the communiqué, *FT.com* had published 71 articles concerning crimes against humanity prosecutions by the ICC, 80% of which referred to acts of violence in Africa. Only three concerned Western states \(Ireland and Israel\). After publishing their article discussing Dr Kalpouzos et al.’s first key finding – that the ICC has a role to play in holding Western nations to account – these numbers have increased significantly. In the year following February 2017, two of the *FT*’s five crimes against humanity articles concerned ICC action against the US – the first ever such action documented in the *FT*. To date the percentage of Western to rest\-of\-world ICC coverage has fallen to 22% of the 40 articles, but this is still markedly above the 3% pre\-2017 level. This increase in coverage of ICC cases against Western actors indicates a significant impact of the findings of Dr Kalpouzos’ research on the e\-papers’ 760,000 and 1,200,000 daily readers \[5.2\] – almost 10% and 2% of London and the UK’s populations respectively. 

 In addition to the overall impact on UK society and the change to UK newspapers’ coverage of ICC cases, publishing Dr Kalpouzos’ research findings also enriched the performance of these papers.  The story was picked up immediately by all four Australian news websites with daily visitor numbers over 1,000,000. The research findings subsequently formed the basis of full articles in leading European and US online magazines \( *Der Spiegel* and *Foreign Policy* magazines, which reach 3,000,000 and 1,600,000 Europeans and North American subscribers per month, respectively\).  The Australian daily visitor figures suggest the key research findings could have reached anywhere up to 10 million Australian readers on publication day.  Similar to the level of awareness raising in the UK, this represents a potential awareness change in 4% of the Australian population. The findings have impacted measurable portions of populations in all three border zones studied in the underpinning research i.e. EU/Libya and Turkey, US/Mexico and Australia/Indonesia. 

 The key research findings, and subsequent dissemination by the press, also underpinned a measurable impact on the Australian economy.  In 2017, the research findings in the ICC communiqué were picked up by two of the country’s largest migrant\-specialist legal aid charities – the Human Rights Law Centre \(HRLC\) and the National Justice Project \(NJP\) – and incorporated into their promotional materials \(see e.g. \[5.3\]\).  Together these account for around 4% by revenue of the national legal aid sector with specialisation in migration \[5.4\].  In Melbourne, where HRLC is headquartered, this percentage is almost 10% of the refugee legal aid sector.  An indicator of how significant a change to their services HRLC experienced in 2017 is evident from changes between their 2017 and 2018 annual reports. In particular, of their 9 project areas HRLC printed the two concerning migrants’ rights as sections 7 and 8 in June 2017; by June 2018, these sections were the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> entries. Similarly, of the five projects detailed in NJP’s 2018 annual report, one is based wholesale on concepts of criminal liability outlined in Dr Kalpouzos’ and his collaborators’ research. Both these charities reported a significant increase in donations between 2017 and 2018 \(e.g. HRLC reports AUD 600,000 in June 2018, up from AUD 450,000 in June 2017\). A HRLC report – detailing the recent history of Australia’s MPCs – includes the communiqué as 1 of the 15 key events of 2017 \[5.5\]. In London, a charity dedicated to legal aid for migrants and advised by Dr Kalpouzos \(its director describes the research as “seminal” and “tremendously helpful” \[5.6\]\) posted a record increase in donations in the year following the communiqué’s publication. 

 The underpinning research led to a change in public policy in Australia and in intergovernmental organisations. The Australian government was influenced directly by the key findings, referring to the communiqué both in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Evidence of the significance of the impact in the House is indicated by the fact that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection critiqued the communiqué directly the day after its release \[5.7\]. The utility of the communiqué to the Senate is clear also – the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee produced a comprehensive report in April 2017 urging both houses to abolish Australian\-backed MPCs.  This report relied heavily on the research findings embodied in the communiqué, which was cited 36 times in the 245\-page report \[5.8\].  One of the two MPCs operating on the Indonesian border at that time was closed within six months of this report. 

 Impact on intergovernmental bodies occurred in the component institutions of the United Nations and also at the International Criminal Court itself. The OHCHR was urged in February 2018, by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment \(SR for CIDT\), to compel the ICC’s Prosecutor to \(his final remark\): “examine whether investigations for crimes against humanity are warranted in view of \[...\] serious human rights violations suffered by refugees \[at MPCs\] as a direct or indirect consequence of deliberate state policies”. According to his colleague, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, the SR for CIDT built his submission on Dr Kalpouzos’ and colleagues’ research. The research was of significant value to her work \(by providing “the perfect conceptual frame \[...\] to describe the almost casual nature in which \[refugees’\] rights are violated \[at MPCs\]” \[5.9\]\). 

 Lastly, the ICC itself has been impacted by the key research findings.  Indicators of the significance include that 4 of the ICC Prosecutor’s 30 statements to the UN Security Council in May 2019 refer to her mandate to protect migrants. Although the court’s formal response to the communiqué in February 2020 stated that the Prosecutor would not investigate Australia’s management of the MPCs, it concluded that violations of human rights at Australian MPCs had constituted one element of an ICC crime against humanity. The response directly addressed each of the arguments set out in the underpinning research \[5.10\]. The second of the two Australian MPCs was formally retired in March 2019 after new Australian legislation enabled medical evacuation of remaining detainees.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since the previous REF, the University of Bristol’s patented ‘Ice Pigging’ technology has grown into a global industry; in 2015, the second largest water company in the world, Suez, bought the universal patent and acquired two Ice Pigging spin\-outs. With an annual turnover of up to GBP6.5 million in this REF period, and directly employing around 100 people, the innovative pipe cleaning method is now used by water companies throughout the world, including the US, Australia, Chile, Spain, Japan, Singapore and Italy, achieving environmental benefits, time savings and increased profitability. The versatility and cross\-sectorial benefit that Ice Pigging offers has led to it also being adopted in the heating, food, cosmetic, chemical, and paints industries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Cleaning and unblocking pipelines is a necessity within industry, with two methods being traditionally relied upon. The first involves propelling a solid piston\-like object, or ‘pig’, through pipes, which must be reasonably straight and of constant diameter. The pig can be damaging to pipe walls and requires purpose\-built launch and receive stations. The second method is liquid flushing, which uses huge volumes of water, and which, in large\-diameter pipes, can fail to achieve the required velocities for effective cleaning. Following the flushing, harsh chemicals such as caustic soda are used to dissolve any residue. In addition, there is the issue of process efficiency; for industrial applications, the pipework may need to be cleaned on a regular basis and in certain applications, such as in food factories, the lines may require cleaning on a daily basis. 

 The question was then, how to clean equipment with difficult topologies \(varying pipe diameters, bends, valves\) in a way that reduces water consumption and the need for harsh chemicals, and that requires less time. The method should also be Clean in Place \(CIP\); the equipment doesn’t have to be disassembled for cleaning. Professor Quarini conceived the ‘ice pig’ to address these issues. The technology was patented in 2001 **\[1\]**, and over the years 2001\-2013, his research group was awarded government grants **\[i\-iii\]** that enabled the ice pig to be developed, trialled, and adapted for cross\-sector use. 

###  The Ice Pig concept 

 Ice Pigging is a CIP method that uses a concentrated suspension of ice particles in a solution containing a freezing point depressant \(usually salt\), otherwise known as an ‘ice slurry’. The slurry is introduced to a pipeline and quickly forms a plug that can be pushed through the pipe\-work with a pressure differential. The slurry can form a plug whenever possible, while also flowing through restrictions and complex topologies when required. Whereas solid pigs become lodged, in the event of a blockage the ice pig simply melts away, thus avoiding costly excavation works. Further, unlike conventional pigs, the ice pig can be introduced into complex networks of pipes through existing valves, thus avoiding expensive enabling work. 

###  Development of the ice pig for industrial use 

 Over 2001\-2004, DEFRA funding **\[i\]** enabled Quarini’s research group to conduct preliminary trials of the ice pig’s efficiency at cleaning fouling materials relevant to a range of industries, including jam and fats, meat, toothpaste, and fine slit and sand \(Fig.1\). The trials indicated that the ice pig was highly adept at removing ‘soft' fouling; using a volume of ice typically less than one tenth of the volume of water required for flushing **\[2\]**. They also found that the ice pig held together, was self\-healing, and maintained its identity under most flow conditions **\[3\]**. The group then investigated the distance an ice pig could survive as a plug\-like entity before melting. Based on experiments and modelling of ice slurries flowing in un\-insulated steel pipes, they developed a numerical model to predict ice pig longevity. Dr Stan Shire \(Research Fellow 2003\-2008\) worked on generic aspects of ice slurry flows and developed correlations relating the complex coupling between pressure drop, flow rates and ice fraction, which were needed to establish the operational regime of the ice slurries which were the ‘ice pig’. The key conceptual breakthrough was better understanding the rheology so as to customise both the rheology of the ice pig itself as well as the equipment to store and pump the slurry **\[4\]**. 

 
 
 

 *Figure 1. A thick Ice Pig going through a meat\-processing pipe* 

 In 2006, the spin\-out PCIP was formed to disseminate, licence and commercialise the technology. The same year, the first trials were conducted on live water mains in the Bristol area. These trials showed that Ice Pigging: 

-  improved water quality; 

-  reduced water and disinfectant usage; 

-  reduced downtime during cleaning programmes; 

-  did not require excavation for access to mains, instead being injected and extracted through existing hydrants. 

 These promising results were published together with data enabling engineers to scale and size the ice pig for full\-scale trials **\[5\]**. By the end of the 2000’s, the technology was recognised as a significant innovation for the process sector, earning a number of prestigious awards: 

-  Engineer Award for Process and Production \(2009\) 

-  Water Industry Achievement Awards for Most Innovative Technology of the Year \(2009\) 

-  International Water Association Project Innovation Award \(2010\) 

 In 2010, three postdoctoral Ice Pigging researchers \(Ainslie, Deans and Herbert\) set up another spin\-out, ADHQ, to provide expert design, assembly and commissioning of Ice Pigging systems for companies wanting to deploy the technology. ADHQ partnered with a local small company, Barvick Engineering, to manufacture bespoke Ice Pigging equipment at scale \(see Section 4\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Ice Pigging has revolutionised the way that pipes are cleaned in the UK and worldwide. During this REF period, it has expanded into a lucrative global industry, creating new jobs and providing cost and time savings for businesses not only in the water industry, but also in heating, food, cosmetics, manufacturing, chemical and power generation. 

###  Expansion of global Ice Pigging industry 

 In 2015, the Ice Pigging industry was acquired by Suez \(formerly Aqualogy\), the second largest water company in the world, for GBP\[text removed for publication\]. The company purchased the complete \(universal\) patent for the technology, covering all geographical and sectorial areas. It also acquired both the PCIP and ADHQ spin\-outs founded by University of Bristol Ice Pigging researchers. PCIP had ongoing consultancy contracts and licences at the time, all of which were taken up by Suez. All existing ADHQ staff accepted well\-paid roles at Suez. 

 Suez’s Ice Pigging industry has reported an annual turnover of up to GBP6.5 million, combining turnover in the UK, the US, Australia, Chile, Spain and Italy. They currently employ up to 100 people in the Ice Pigging sector **\[A\]**. The Operations Director at Suez states that: *‘\[Ice Pigging\] has been a game\-changer for our business. The benefits of Ice Pigging have led us to develop the technology globally, secure business with key customers and obtain repeat contracts. We look forward to continuing to provide Ice Pigging technology for our customers going forward and are grateful for the research undertaken by the University of Bristol which led to the development of this technology.’* **\[A\]** 

 Aside from Suez and its customers, Ice Pigging has had significant economic impact for the regionally\-based manufacturer Barvick Engineering, which originally collaborated with Quarini to develop the Ice Pigging equipment. Barvick has continued to supply equipment for Suez, with Ice Pigging equipment sales accounting for around 20% of the company’s turnover over the past six years **\[B\]**. 

###  Improved business performance of the water and sewerage industry 

 Between 2014 and 2019, Suez cleaned 100\-200km of customer pipework per year in the UK, or approximately 900km of pipe in total over the period **\[A\]**. Customers include Welsh Water, Hafren Dyfrdwy, Northumbrian Water, Affinity Water, Anglian Water, United Utilities, Southern Water, South East Water, South West Water and Wessex Water **\[A\]**. Internationally, Suez has delivered Ice Pigging extensively in Europe, the US, Japan, Australia and Singapore, cleaning a total of 4,500km of pipes globally during the REF period **\[A, C\]**. 

 Over 2016\-2017, the largest water\-only supplier in the UK, Affinity Water, used Ice Pigging to conduct one of the largest mains\-cleaning exercises within the water industry in recent years. One of the project’s highest risk elements was cleaning the cast iron/coal tar lined mains without adversely affecting water quality. Most companies choose the “not able to clean” approach or choose to relay or reline the pipes, at significant cost. In this case, Ice Pigging enabled effective cleaning of the pipes without affecting water quality. Over 950km was cleaned overall, ‘ *this includes over 120km of trunk mains and, in particular, over 80km of cast iron / bitumen / coal tar lined mains cleaned without incident. The project has delivered significant cost savings as result of direct contracts with specialist contractors and the contract model will be adopted for similar works going forward.*’ **\[D\]** Aside from these benefits, zero customer complaints were received during the entirety of the works, environmental impact was reduced \(with no harsh or synthetic chemicals required\), and approximately 5,000 tonnes of excavated waste material was prevented from going to landfill **\[E\]**. Furthermore, excavations were limited, as existing hydrants and valves were used to insert and retrieve the ice pig. 

 Other Ice Pigging success stories across the industry include: 

-  Dee Valley Water saw a reduction in the number of discoloured water complaints, from 4.9 per 1,000 customers in 2013 down to 1.32 in 2015 **\[F\]**, following an extensive mains cleaning operation to rid pipes of residual manganese. 

-  Hafren Dyfrdwy \(which brought together Severn Trent and Dee Valley Water in 2018 and now serves almost 85,000 homes\) **\[F\]**, completed 14 overnight Ice Pigging cleaning runs in Wrexham in 2019, which removed over two tonnes of sediment from 17.3km of pipes. *‘We’re really happy to say we had zero customer complaints relating to the cleaning process or traffic management, and many customers weren’t aware that work was being done in the area. The cleaning programme will continue next year and will help to ensure the network is significantly cleaner, which means we can continue to provide customers with great quality water.*’ **\[G\]** 

-  Welsh Water undertook a programme of works that involved cleaning 385km of potable water mains \(2018\). Their Contract Manager states *: ‘A typical ice pigging run takes less than an hour to complete, meaning the impact on the key measure of ‘customer minutes lost’ is minimal. This, along with less holes being dug outside customers’ properties, has ensured the projects have been successfully delivered with reduced disruption.*’ **\[H\]** 

-  Starting in 2013, Yarra Valley Water \(Australia\) launched a full\-scale programme to Ice Pig approximately 400 km of water mains per year for five years. Following the programme, the company reported a significant reduction in water quality complaints, which in some cases were virtually eliminated **\[I\]**. 

###  Improved business performance of the heating industry 

 Ice Pigging has also been effective in the commissioning of district heating systems. This sector is rapidly growing in the UK and is seen as one of the key target areas for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in densely populated areas. Each new district heating system involves networks of flow and return pipework between the energy production plants and individual buildings/developments. The standard approach for commissioning these networks involves using a high velocity chemical flush through side stream filters, which can take up to two weeks and has relatively high\-power requirements. With Ice Pigging, Suez can clean the same networks to an equal or better standard in just a few hours, requiring no chemicals and very little energy. Customers include Eneteq, Vital Energi, ENGIE and Pinnacle Power, together with work on flagship projects including Wembley Park and Heathrow Airport **\[A\]**. 

 In 2018, ENGIE used Ice Pigging to undertake a pre\-commissioning clean to remove swarf and construction debris from 1,560m of 300mm diameter pipework. This was part of the Angel Lane District Stratford project to extend the existing heating and cooling pipework connection as part of the construction of a 33\-story tower block with 181 apartments. A total of 64kg of sediment was removed. Works took place without exceeding the normal operating pressure of the pipework or causing damage to the pipe walls. Existing fittings for all pipe connections were utilised, and therefore no enabling works were required for the operation. All pipes were cleaned within one day, whereas a conventional flush of the network would have taken approximately one week and required high flows and pumping costs. Additionally, 30\-50% less water was used than would have been required using typical flushing techniques **\[A\]**. 

 Since 2017, Eneteq Services Ltd have used Ice Pigging on many of their newly installed networks, and have found that the method generally allows for the full network to be cleaned in a single day, provides a zero risk of blockages caused by the process, and also accommodates to all diameters of pipes, bends, valves and any other fittings. Eneteq has since applied Ice Pigging on high profile developments at Wembley Stadium and Heathrow Airport and states: ‘ *We will be continuing the use of Ice Pigging technology in cleaning operations and have several already in the planning stages.*’ **\[J\]** 

###  Improved business performance \(time and cost savings\) in other industries 

 Ice Pigging has been trialed with great success in other sectors including food and beverage, chemical, cosmetic, manufacturing, power generation and defense. In 2016, Yeo Valley wanted to improve their flushing method for cleaning remaining product from production lines. An Ice Pigging trial resulted in reduced waste, water use and chemicals, as well as improved product recovery. Ice Pigging equipment was then supplied and installed at the site **\[A\]**. In the same year, \[text removed for publication\] conducted onsite trials of Ice Pigging, which demonstrated that a 20% time saving was possible, resulting in the potential to increase production output with no additional investment. As a result, bespoke Ice Pigging equipment was installed at the site in 2017 **\[A\]**. In 2018, Suez supplied Ice Pigging equipment to Johnson Matthey, a global leader in chemicals and materials. The method proved to be a “game changer” in recovering material from pipe systems. Most importantly, it was able to reduce the long flushing times of up to eight hours to a matter of minutes, resulting in improved production efficiency **\[A\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research into Strategic Technology and Innovation Management approaches and tools at the Institute for Manufacturing \(IfM\) at the University of Cambridge has benefitted businesses, non\-profit organisations and charities in developing strategies and plans for shaping the future of their organisations. **\[text redacted for publication\],** was instrumental in developing the successful EUR1,000,000,000 proposal for the EU Graphene Flagship which currently has a workforce of 1675, is driving new approaches to workplace well\-being in the rail sector and creating jobs, and is guiding the deployment of new technologies for search and rescue by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. IfM supports translation of the research into practice by working collaboratively with organisations to develop strategy ‘roadmaps’ and by helping organisations develop in\-house roadmapping capabilities. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research at the Institute for Manufacturing \(IfM\) at the University of Cambridge has led to new planning methods and tools that support organisational strategy and decision making. Structured approaches to planning developed in the research aid organisations in developing ‘roadmaps’ for identifying new opportunities for growth and support the management of risk. The structured roadmapping approaches are underpinned by visual toolkits developed in the research. 

 Early research focussed on roadmapping approaches for strategy and planning for businesses in technology\-intensive fields where the rate of change is high and markets can be disruptive. In \[R1\], general characteristics of technology roadmaps were identified and a ‘fast\-start’ roadmapping process was introduced. The developed roadmapping approach is a combination of process, e.g. structured workshops, and visual tools for articulating and communicating a roadmap. The fast\-start method was illustrated in \[R1\] for two cases in the context of disruptive technological trends. The research in \[R1\] was developed into the concept of integrated toolkits in \[R2\] for technology management. The plethora of tools and processes that are available to support management decisions may not interact consistently, robustly or transparently, and \[R2\] addressed this issue and proposed how to work consistently and robustly across management planning tools. 

 Further research focussed on the effective development and application of strategic technology management tools in industrial settings based on collaborative deployments with industry \[R3\]. This included the roadmapping toolkits themselves, managing the complexity of roadmapping, and the social aspect of how groups within a business can best collaboratively develop effective and successful roadmaps for technology management. Seven principles were defined in \[R3\] – human\-centric, workshop\-based, neutrally facilitated, lightly processed, modular, scalable, visual – for the development of strategic technology toolkits that are industrially relevant and academically robust. 

 Roadmaps are visual tools, and the value of visual tools were advocated and demonstrated in \[R1, R2, R3\]. In \[R4\] the visual/graphic design of roadmaps, which had been largely overlooked, was considered. The research investigated the importance of graphic design in communicating roadmaps effectively, and in particular how design supports alignment of the roadmap presentation with the target audience. The research proposed a methodology for developing visual designs driven by a set questions for the designer. The design approach was demonstrated in \[R4\] using roadmaps for the EU\-funded Graphene Flagship \(a EUR 1 billion programme, launched in 2013\), with designs considered for two groups: programme funders and industrial stakeholders. A roadmap for the Graphene Flagship is shown in Figure 1. 



 Figure 1: An example of one of the roadmaps from the EU Graphene Flagship. 

 A feature of the underpinning research is that the early developments have been further developed and refined in close collaboration with businesses from a wide range of sectors, and the necessary adaptions for different sectors investigated. In \[R5\] Kerr and Phaal explored with the LEGO Group the deployment and customisation of roadmapping processes, starting from reference approaches \[R1\] and investigating and reporting on adaptions and implementation in LEGO context. This research provided guidance on how organisations can approach the adaption and configuration of reference strategic roadmapping approaches and tools for their specific circumstances.

 The application of roadmapping research conducted at the University of Cambridge has led to improved business performance and practices, and the adoption of new technologies for businesses and non\-profit organisations. The translation of roadmapping research into practice is accelerated by IfM’s Education and Consultancy Services through training courses and consultancy. Between 2014 and 2019, IfM has supported organisations through over 400 roadmapping and visualisation projects, generating over GBP5,000,000 in project revenue, and training courses for over 500 participants \[E1\]. The Strategic Technology and Innovation Management Consortium was formed at IfM in 2013 to connect roadmapping research to practice. In 2020 the consortium had 20 members, including De Beers, GlaxoSmithKline, Huawei, Johnson Matthey, Michelin and Subsea 7. 

 **Subsea 7** is a global engineering business with 14,000 employees delivering offshore projects and services. Since 2015, Subsea 7 has worked with IfM on roadmapping to guide their corporate strategy. **\[text redacted for publication\]** \[E2\].

The **Rail Safety and Standards Board \(RSSB\)** supports the rail industry in Great Britain in improving the health and safety performance. In 2013 the RSSB estimated that sickness and absenteeism was costing the industry GBP316,000,000 per year \[E3\]. In the Winter of 2013, IfM worked with RSSB to create a roadmap for the industry’s strategy and vision for health and well\-being \(see opposite for the Roadmap itself\). The Roadmap has been guiding initiatives to improve health and wellbeing since 2104. 

 “*Roadmapping enabled us to bring together views from over 60 organisations to create a plan that is guiding the direction of activity in relation to the key strategic themes. We have progressed significantly in the last four years from a situation where organisations were questioning the activity they should be doing to an acceptance of the importance of health and wellbeing across the rail sector. UK rail organisations are increasing the numbers of health experts and budgets for health initiatives within rail companies. As an example, one large organisation has gone from employing one person in occupational health to employing 18, with similar investment across a number of organisations. . . The roadmap has had the biggest single impact on what we are doing in health and wellbeing and is fundamental to the progress we have made and our plans moving forward.”*

 The **EU Graphene Flagship** used roadmapping in developing its successful 10\-year, EUR1,000,000,000 Future and Emerging Technology Flagship programme bid \[E4\]. The industry\-academic collaboration to develop and apply graphene in industry launched in October 2013. The Flagship workforce was 1,675 strong on March 2016 \[E5\], and it had 78 industrial partners in 2019 \[E6\]. Roadmapping is used in ongoing strategic planning, with in\-house capacity now in place. 

 *“The roadmap that we prepared together with the Cambridge team in connection with the flagship proposal has proven much more accurate and robust than anyone could expect. It summarizes our plans in a condensed, visually appealing way, and is still used when presenting the Graphene Flagship to diverse audiences. We have since formed our roadmapping activities to a tool that is continuously updated and provides key input when we plan the next stages of our work.”* 

 Director of the Graphene Flagship, Chalmers University of Technology \[E4\] 

 **The Royal National Lifeboat Institution \(RNLI\)** has used roadmapping since 2016 to support their goal of halving the number accidental coastal deaths by 2024 through technological advances. Outcomes of roadmapping include \(i\) establishment in April 2019 of a 12\-month trial of unmanned aerial vehicles for searches in hazardous locations, \(ii\) withdrawal of RNLI investment in bespoke systems where commercial investment was increasing, and \(iii\) trialling of new systems for securing donations \[E7\]. 

 “*Our use of current and emerging technologies will be more effective if we have a comprehensive view what’s going on across the sector, helping us to collaborate with the right organisations on the right projects. Roadmapping is playing a significant part in how we are doing this.*” 

 Future Lifesaving Innovation Lead, RNLI \[E7\] 

 **John Hogg Ltd,** a manufacturer of chemical marking systems for protection against counterfeit and tampering, worked with IfM in 2017 to create a new business strategy and embed roadmapping within the organisation. Impacts include \[E8\]: 

-  Reallocation of GBP1,400,000 in R&D investment to focus on other key growth areas. 

-  Investments in new equipment and new staff to improve operation efficiency by 20%. 

 On the roadmapping approach: 

 *“We felt that for us as an SME the return on our investment was high. Not only did it help crystallise our vision for the business, it gave us confidence in our decision\-making.”*

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 With the advent of social media the British Military faced a communication environment that they could not ultimately control, and which presented them with significant risks as well as opportunities. Maltby and her team worked empirically to capture and analyse the broad landscape of social media use in the military. The research successfully bridged the gap between older policy makers \(suspicious of social media\) and personnel for whom social media was an everyday reality. Their findings and recommendations were largely adopted by the British Army in their guidelines for social media use. The research was also used to advise the Joint Insight Forum in relation to recruitment and online behaviour, and has had a wide impact on changing perceptions around social media within the military. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Professor Sarah Maltby is an internationally acknowledged media studies expert working in the field of media management research in relation to military institutions and conflict studies \[R1\]. She has been working empirically and analytically in this area since 2001, focusing on issues of media strategy, risk management, psychological and behavioural concerns \[R2, R3\]. Digital media increasingly offers opportunities for the British Armed Forces in strategic and operational contexts \[R1, R2\], and as a public relations tool. Simultaneously, however, with the growing use of social media among 200,000 armed forces personnel \[R4\] there are clear tensions between their social media use and the centralised requirements for control, security, and robust reputational management. These tensions are compounded by the lack of social media expertise among senior management that has generated risk aversion strategies that prohibit proactive and effective management of digital media \[R3\]. As Clare Parker, former Head of Insight and Evaluation at the Directorate of Defence and Communications in the Ministry of Defence stated, “older people who tend to be in command say \[…\] ‘don’t use social media’” \[S2\]. 

 In 2014 Maltby \(PI\) designed and ran the “D.U.N. Project: Defence, Uncertainty and ‘Now Media’: Mapping Social Media in Strategic Communications” funded by Defence, Science and Technology Labs and the ESRC with Co\-I Helen Thornham \(Leeds\) and Daniel Bennett \(post\-doctoral Research Fellow\). The objective of the D.U.N. Project was to interrogate how social media was perceived, managed and responded to differently at a strategic \(MoD\), Institutional \(Army, Navy, Airforce\) and individual level \(Armed Forces Personnel\) using the combined methods of qualitative interviews, focus groups and textual analysis. The research was extensive and ranged across collecting weekly data from online military forums to intensive discussions with personnel and their partners. All three researchers \(Maltby, Thornham, Bennett\) were involved in all aspects of the research but were directed by Maltby, who took the lead in the analysis of the data, and in presenting the findings to the military. The aim was to identify the conceptualisation and reality of risks and opportunities presented by social media across constituent levels and how this could be better managed. 

 The project findings indicated that: 

-  Understandings of use of social media were relatively narrow in military command, undermining effective management of social media risk and opportunity, particularly with regard to the training of Armed Forces personnel and their families \[R3, R4, R5\]. 

-  Dominant cultures of risk aversion in the Defence community cause personnel to misapprehend the institutional risks of social media despite the centrality of social media to their everyday lives, leading to clandestine behaviours \[R4\]. 

-  Informal, public facing communications within the social media space, particularly pseudonymous spaces, were significantly undermining of the Armed Forces’ reputation particularly with regard to issues of gender equality that feed into issues of recruitment and retention \[R6\]. 

-  The tendency to see social media predominantly in terms of risk significantly undermines opportunities to develop digital knowledge, expertise, and management within the wider Armed Forces community, particularly around issues of training, recruitment and retention \[R3\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Impacting on Social Media Policy** 

 In 2018 the British Army published a new set of guidelines for Army personnel: *\#DigitalArmy: Using Social Media in the British Army* \[S8\]. The guidance adopts the central recommendations of Maltby’s research: to recognise social media as a fact of everyday life and not something that can be prohibited; to recognise the opportunity for social media to offer positive representations of army life; but also to give clear guidance about what constitutes unacceptable behaviour \(from security breaches to inter\-personal bullying and sexual harassment\). *\#DigitalArmy* uses the language of Maltby’s research, introducing ideas of reputational management and risk \(p. 2\) and arguing that there is no absolute anonymity online \(‘pseudonymity’\). Referring to the work of Maltby and her team, the document states: “Research shows that some of our best received communications are created by more junior ranks using digital channels in an authentic manner. The Army is keen to support them” \[S8 p. 2\]. This represents a decisive shift in policy that acknowledges not simply the reality of social media, but that younger recruits might be the ones most able to contribute to the reputational growth of the Army. 

 For an institution that is inevitably hierarchical, the dramatic shift underpinning the new policy was generational: thus Lt. Col. \[text removed for publication\] admits that “the issue we have is we tend to have older people like myself making policy decisions and we need to be able to encompass what young people think in order to make those policies as effective as possible” \[S6\]. It was this younger perspective that informed *\#DigitalArmy* and was a direct consequence of Maltby’s research: “when I was reviewing the Army’s new social media policy \[…\] I did so with Sarah’s work at the forefront of my mind” \[S6\]. 

 Maltby’s work emphasised what is at stake around social media and the military: as Blanca Grey, Directorate of Defence Communications, put it, “Maltby really gave us an initial idea of how people perceive the armed forces as not being very inclusive” \[S7\], and this was predominantly due to online material. The research recommendation to encourage ‘healthy’ social media and to have a policy of responsibility and openness around social media practice “which was taken on board by senior MOD personnel at the time” \[S7\] is fundamentally embedded in the guidelines and was adopted as part of a policy on retention and inclusivity. *\#DigitalArmy* guidelines are distributed to all Army service personnel \(approximately 79,000 regular full\-time personnel and 27,000 reserve part\-time personnel\) and incorporated into annual refresher and pre\-deployment training sessions marking a significant footprint for this research \[S8\]. 

 **Changing Perceptions of Social Media in the Armed Forces** 

 The findings from the research were shared at a series of workshops with the Heads of Digital Communications for each of the military services and senior personnel at the Joint Services Command and Staff College \(JSCSC\). Later Maltby was invited to join the Joint Insight Forum \- a newly formed MOD committee of insight and evaluation representatives working across Defence. Maltby’s research initially challenged, even shocked senior military, but that shock resulted in fundamentally new understandings of the opportunities afforded by social media. For a senior academic at the Defence Studies Department at JSCSC, “\[Maltby’s\] research challenges much of the received wisdom about the MoD's understanding of both the digital environment and how defence practitioners operate within it” \[S3\]. For another figure involved in Royal Air Force communications at the highest level, the recommendation that “we shouldn’t even try to exert control was well made but potentially shocking”; but this shock led to the recognition that “it’s an important element that we need to tease out and agree on” \[S4\]. 

 The new understandings generated by Maltby’s research took military thinking away from focusing solely on risk. Thus Clare Parker, Head of Insight and Evaluation at the MOD, found that the “research gave me a better understanding of how we in the MOD need to manage the culture of risk aversion \[…\] Sarah’s work was brilliant and it distilled a lot of long term ‘niggles’ I had about social media and the way the military treated it. It was really helpful” \[S2\]. The shift away from an obsession with risk allowed the military to think and plan much more generatively around welfare, inclusivity and retention, recognising the crucial role that social media has in maintaining family life. Thus, for a former senior staff member involved in developing the Royal Navy’s Digital Strategy for Defence Communications, research “like Sarah’s is important \- if you get this right, you change lives” \[S1\]. For them, Maltby’s work is continuing to have impact, because it is used to “look at families and the impact on families through social media \[which\] can help to deliver a sort of strategic effect, which is all about retention” \[S1\]. 

 **Impact Legacy** 

 The British Military are necessarily a secretive institution and unwilling to fully acknowledge how they will exploit and deploy research findings. Thus Neil Verrall, Principal Psychologist in the Defence and Security Analysis Division of Defence Science and Technology Laboratory has only hesitantly revealed that further exploitation of Maltby’s findings is underway, “but due to classification of the projects/topics we cannot provide any further info…except to reassure you that your work is being used along with many other projects to articulate and understand specific issues of interest” \[S5\]. He is however emphatic: “please be reassured that your important work has not been forgotten” \[S5\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Birmingham has improved the management of patients with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension \(IIH\) by achieving the following: 

1.  **Improved patient outcomes**, including reducing episodes of blindness, fewer lumbar punctures, surgical procedures and hospital admissions; 

1.  **Development of the first International and European clinical guidelines for IIH**; 

1.  **International change in clinical practice for the management of IIH patients**; 

1.  **Creation of a spin\-out company** to bring new drugs to patients. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Idiopathic intracranial hypertension \(IIH\) is a condition of unknown aetiology characterised by raised intracranial pressure \(ICP\). It is a disease of socioeconomic deprivation mainly affecting obese young women \(95% of cases\) and causing severe disabling headaches which reduce quality of life and can ultimately lead to blindness. The incidence of IIH has risen rapidly and is currently estimated to be 1 in 20,000, a 100% increase in the last decade, rising in line with global obesity. This has resulted in a 446% increase in associated UK hospital costs, with hospital economic burden rising from £9.2M in 2002 to £49.9M in 2014 \[S1\]. 

 Current therapies for IIH have poor efficacy and tolerability, and 48% of patients discontinue treatment. There are currently no targeted treatments to prevent blindness or severe disabling headache and, lacking an evidence base, international patient management strategies are highly variable. These factors have combined to perpetuate poor outcomes for patients — 25% of patients will have permanent visual loss as a result of optic disc swelling and the majority having chronic disabling headaches. High intracranial pressure is usually diagnosed by performing a lumbar puncture. This procedure also acts as an important treatment although some patients require neurosurgery with intraventricular shunt insertion to release the pressure. 

 Although the vast majority of patients with IIH are obese, there was previously a lack of firm evidence that weight loss improved the condition. Sinclair developed a cohort of 25 women with active, chronic \(over three months\) IIH and identified **that 15% weight loss led to disease remission**, as evidenced by a **significant reduction in ICP** and **optic disc swelling \(papilloedema\)** measured by optical coherence tomography \(OCT\) \[R1\]. 

 In a further study, Sinclair then demonstrated for the first time that the use of OCT **to monitor papilloedema was beneficial** in clinical practice as an effective surrogate for raised ICP \[R2\]. For patients with sight\-threatening IIH, neurosurgical shunting procedures are performed to prevent blindness. However, there was previously no guidance to determine when this procedure should be undertaken, leading to many unnecessary surgical interventions. Sinclair reported on many potentially life\-changing complications as a result of surgery, including blockage \(12%\), disconnection \(7%\) and infection \(8%\) with 51% of shunts failing and needing revision surgery within a year. The study concluded that **shunt surgery** **should only be performed to preserve rapidly declining vision**, and was not appropriate in other settings which could be managed medically, indicating that clinical practice needed to change \[R3\]. 

 In a patient and physician research partnership, Sinclair also identified that patients were experiencing significant complications from lumbar punctures, including severe pain \(40%\) and extreme anxiety \(47%\) \[R4,  [Patient experience of lumbar puncture](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2018/03/05/alex-sinclair-and-sandra-doughty-illuminating-the-patient-experience-of-lumbar-puncture/)\] and furthermore illustrated **lack of efficacy** with headache exacerbation in 64%. The study concluded that performing repeated lumbar punctures in IIH should stop \[R5\]. 

 There are no licenced drugs to treat IIH. Sinclair identified the **therapeutic potential of** **exenatide** a **glucagon\-like peptide 1 receptor agonist to reduce ICP**, through its ability to reduce brain fluid production in animal models \[R6\]. The magnitude of effect is greater than any other drugs used in IIH. Exenatide is currently used for other conditions, and induces significant weight loss, a known disease modifier in IIH. Sinclair then performed a randomised placebo controlled trial in patients with IIH which demonstrated an acute \(24 hours\) and sustained significant reduction in ICP which was maintained for 12 weeks of dosing \(Presented to the 14<sup>th</sup> European Headache Federation Congress in 2019. Abstract in Journal of Headache and Pain 2021 in press\). 

  

 Key findings from the research are summarised below: 

 **KF1.** Weight loss leads to remission of IIH \[R1\]; 

 **KF2.** Optical coherence tomography is beneficial to disease monitoring \[R2\]; 

 **KF3.** Shunt surgery in IIH should only be conducted to preserve vision \[R3\]; 

 **KF4.** Lack of efficacy of Lumbar puncture \(LPs\) in managing IIH \[R4, R5\]; 

 **KF5.** The glucagon\-like peptide 1 receptor agonist \(Exenatide\) is a novel drug strategy to reduce ICP and to treat IIH \[R6\].

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 The management and treatment of patients with IIH has been shaped by Sinclair’s research in four key ways. 

 . 

1.  **Improved outcomes and understanding for patients with IIH** 

 Evaluation of UK Health Episodes Statistics data shows the following patient outcomes have improved: 

-  **Reduction in IIH patients registered blind** — from 2.1% prior to 2018 to 1.4% in 2019 \[S1\].  This benefit stems from the adoption of OCT imaging \[R2; KF2\] into practice, which “helps to guide on which patients need shunt surgery to prevent blindness” \(S4\). 

-  **Reduced hospital admissions** as a result of **reductions in lumbar punctures and shunt procedures** \[S1\]: 

  -  Shunting levels were consistently high prior to 2018 but have markedly fallen since, from 8.3% \(2002–2016 \[S1\]\) of IIH patients to 3.1% \(2018–2019, \[S1\]\); 

-  Shunt revision rates falling from 2.8% to 0.6%, reflecting revision of shunt for visual issues/visual failure only \[S1\]; 

-  The proportion of patients requiring re\-admissions for IIH, within one year of diagnosis, has also decreased from 38% \(2002–2016\) to 35% \(2018–2019\), whilst reductions in the proportions of patients requiring >2 admissions to hospital per year has fallen from 11.9% \(2002–2016\) to 9.3% \(2018–2019\), \[S1\]. These data reflect a reduction in attendance for repeated lumbar puncture and shunt surgery. 

-  Patients can now make more **informed treatment decisions**. For example, it is now clear that weight loss is an important form of disease management and an approach to avoid harmful therapies, such as lumbar punctures and shunt surgery \[R2, R3\]. Evidence that patient knowledge and understanding has markedly improved was demonstrated in spring 2020 using E\-surveys to patients \(465 UK respondents and 115 international respondents\). These documented that patients’ understanding of optimal care has been enhanced \[S2\] with: 

-  99% of respondents now aware of the link between body weight and IIH; 

-  89% aware that surgery should be reserved for people losing vision; 

-  71% aware that there was a limited medical role for LPs. 

 Sinclair reinforced these messages through her role as Patron of the National IIH charity, where patient education was delivered through Question and Answer videos, patient conferences and patient information leaflets published on the charity website \[S3i–ii\]. 

1.  **Development of the first International clinical guidelines to shape IIH patient care and improve patient management** 

 Sinclair led development of the **first international guidelines for IIH** \[S4i–iv\], published in 2018. Prior to this, there was no standardised care for management of IIH and practices varied widely around the globe.  Sinclair was then commissioned to **produce the European Headache Federation IIH guideline** \[S4ii\] \(2018\).  Recommendations include: 

1.  “Primary principle for IIH management: modify the underlying disease through weight loss” \[S4i, page 1092; S4ii, page 10; R1\]; 

1.  That OCT should be introduced for objective monitoring of papilloedema \[S4i, page 1090; S4ii, page 3; R2\]; 

1.  That shunting surgery should only be conducted to preserve vision \[S4i, page1093–4; S4ii, page 7–8; R3\], and make firm recommendations to change practice in patient management; 

1.  That “Serial lumbar punctures are not recommended for management of IIH” \[S4i, page 1095; S4ii, page 11; R4, R5\). 

1.  **International change in clinical practice for the management of IIH patients** 

 Patient care practices and services have been redesigned both nationally and internationally, in line with the service set up by Sinclair at the University of Birmingham \(the largest in Europe\). 

 Clinical practice has changed in three key ways: 

1.  **Pathways for weight loss have been introduced** \[R1; KF1\]. The percentage of patients with recorded weight counselling has risen since 2018 \[S1\]. Data from the patient e\-survey indicated that >50% of patients felt the guidelines had helped doctors to improve their care, in key areas such as weight management \[S2\]. 

1.  **OCT has been introduced for objective monitoring of papilloedema** \[R2; KF2\]. That this is the case is confirmed by Professor of Neurology at the Danish Headache Center University of Copenhagen \(2021, \[S5\]\) who states “These changes to patient care, detailed in the IIH guidelines, have led to redesign of routine care pathways globally to improve patient outcomes. Internationally we have adopted the use of OCT image to monitor papilloedema in clinics.  This has had the benefits of reducing the need for painful LPs and helps to guide on which patients need shunt surgery to prevent blindness” \[S1\]. 

1.  **Collaborative working takes place between multiple specialities.** A multidisciplinary team approach bringing together neurology, ophthalmology, neurosurgery and dietetics has been adopted to allow the correct selection of patients for shunt surgery \[R3; KF3\].  This approach was identified as important during the James Lind Priority setting Partnership 2018 “multidisciplinary clinics were scored as important” \[page 4, S6\] and change is evidenced by a reduction in shunt procedures and reduced shunt revisions, alongside reduced rates of blindness seen in patients \[S1\].  International change is further attested to by Professor of Neurology at the Danish Headache Center University of Copenhagen \(2021\) who states “The change in practice to bring together neurologists, ophthalmologists, and neurosurgeons to work more closely together in a multi\-specialty team has dramatically improved patient care and outcomes and is now a core principle of IIH clinical pathways”. 

1.  **Bringing new drugs to patients through the creation of a University of Birmingham spin\-out company** 

 Significant commercial impact has stemmed from Sinclair’s findings that exenatide can reduce ICP \[R6; KF5\]. Working with University of Birmingham Enterprise Sinclair has: 

-  Secured intellectual property through filing and the granting of a method of use patent; 

-  Obtained orphan drug designation \(ODD\) granted by the FDA and European Medicines Agency \(2017\) \[S7i\]; 

-  Undertaken a proof of concept clinical trial that has culminated in raising significant funding \(round 1 $AU12M \+ round 2 $AU26M\) to create a University of Birmingham spin\-out company, Invex Therapeutics \[S7ii\] to repurpose exenatide specifically for IIH \[S7iii\]. The company was launched on the Australian Stock market in July 2019 \[S7iv–v\] and current value \(19/11/2020\) was Market cap value £29.9M, Enterprise value £15.5M, revenue £91.3k and share value o **f $AU0.8 \[S7vi\].** The company is about to initiate manufacture of the drug Presendin \(reformulated to specifically control ICP\) which will be used in a phase 1 and a large phase 3 international randomised controlled trial in IIH \[S7ii\].  Sinclair is working with the FDA and EMA to file an investigational new drug application \(IND\) and establish trials to enable market authorisation and licencing of the drug for IIH patients. This will be the first licenced drug for IIH and a step\-change in improving patient care.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Many antimicrobial wipes, used to minimise the spread of bacteria in hospital settings, are ineffective and could inadvertently contribute to the spread of potentially fatal pathogenic bacteria. Cardiff researchers developed a new testing protocol for antimicrobial wipes allowing their efficacy to be accurately evaluated in real\-life clinical situations, aligned to improved infection control. The Cardiff protocol for the testing and use of antibacterial wipes was adopted as an American Society for Testing and Materials \(ASTM\) International Standard and enabled a leading UK wipe manufacturer, GAMA Healthcare, to develop new products, drive sales and develop a new £4M R&D facility. These activities delivered £8M in new revenue for the company since 2013. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 According to NHS England, healthcare\-associated infections are estimated to cost the NHS approximately £1 billion a year. Antimicrobial wipes are used for the decontamination of surfaces in healthcare settings to minimise the risk of patients acquiring infections, however, little was known about the efficacy of these anti\-bacterial products and which were most effective in eliminating microbial pathogens. There was also no evidence to inform how wipes should be used in a clinical setting for effective infection control. 

 **2.1 Investigation into the efficacy of anti\-bacterial wipes in Welsh Intensive Care Units** 

 In 2006, the Welsh Government approached Maillard, following his extensive research expertise on antimicrobial biocides and microbial resistance, to investigate the effectiveness of antimicrobial wipes for infection control in Welsh Intensive Care Units. 

 Prior to Cardiff’s research, the evaluation of anti\-bacterial wipes was based solely on the efficacy of the chemical biocide, but not when the biocide was incorporated into a wipe. Cardiff researchers assessed a range of factors, including the nature and concentration of the biocide used in the wipe, the wipe material itself, the nature of the surfaces that needed to be decontaminated, the target pathogens, and the way in which the wipe was being physically used by health care and cleaning staff in clinical situations **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. This research: 

-  enabled accurate evaluation of antimicrobial wipe performance **\[3.1\]** and delivered quantitative reporting outcomes including: the percentage of microbial bioburden removed from surfaces; microbial transfer prevented from wipes to surfaces; and the percentage kill of the target microorganisms that were collected within the wipe; 

-  revealed that the claims provided by wipe manufacturers around antimicrobial efficacy of their wipes were not substantiated by their products **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]**. Maillard explored the ability of the commercially available sporicidal wipes to remove *Clostridioides difficile* spores from an inanimate surface and showed a wide range in efficacy between all wipe products **\[3.3\]**. One wipe did not remove any spores and none of the wipes demonstrated high sporicidal activity within 5 minutes of contact time, except for a control wipe soaked in 5,000\-ppm sodium hypochlorite. All but one commercial wipe demonstrated that spores could be repeatedly transferred to other surfaces. Light\-scattering data provided evidence that some wipes were able to break up spore aggregates, potentially releasing more pathogenic spores onto the surface **\[3.3\]**; 

-  demonstrated the superiority of one antimicrobial product in particular, produced by GAMA Healthcare, in removing spores from a surface **\[3.3\]**; 

-  highlighted a significant risk of the spread of harmful bacteria associated with both ineffective wipe products and the misuse of antimicrobial wipes **\[3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]**. 

 These findings raised significant concern that the wipes themselves, and the methods of using these wipes adopted by healthcare and cleaning staff, could not be relied upon to provide a safe environment within healthcare settings. 

  1.  **Development of a biocide wipe protocol** 

 The research outlined in Section 2.1 also identified the need for users of the wipes, including nurses, healthcare assistants and cleaning staff, to follow a clear procedure to avoid cross\-contamination and the spread of bacteria. Maillard worked with the inventors of a textile testing device called the Wiperator® to inform adaptations of this device so that it could assess the effectiveness of wipes with different biocide formulations and when real\-life use conditions were applied \(e.g., applied force, rubbing speed and duration of wiping\). Previously the Wiperator® could only test the material used in wipe manufacturing but with Cardiff’s input, the device has become an innovative tool for robust microbial wipe efficacy testing **\[3.5\]**. Using this adapted appliance, the Cardiff team developed a new protocol for the testing and clinical use of antimicrobial wipes. They showed that even when a wipe product is proven to be capable of eliminating bacteria, it must be used in a specific way to be effective in minimising the spread of bacteria i.e. one wipe, used on one surface and in one direction, in order to prevent the wipe from spreading bacteria from one surface to another or from one area to another when used on numerous surfaces or in various directions **\[3.6\]**. This protocol clearly demonstrated which products were effective and how they should be used safely to minimise the spread of potentially fatal pathogenic bacteria.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Maillard’s research resulted in a new American Society for Testing and Materials \(ASTM\) International Standard for testing pre\-wetted anti\-bacterial wipes and led to substantial commercial growth for a leading manufacturer of anti\-bacterial cleaning products. 

 **4.1 Evidencing a new ASTM International Standard** 

 ASTM is an international  [organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_organization) that develops and publishes technical  [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard) for materials, products, systems, and  [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics)). Since May 2015, following the Cardiff\-led developments to the Wiperator® device **\[3.5\]**, the Wiperator® has formed the basis of ASTM International standard E2967\-15 for testing pre\-wetted towelettes in accredited laboratories to evaluate the wipe product’s ability to decontaminate surfaces that contain pathogens. The introduction to the ASTM states *: “This standard, formulated after a critical review of available wipe test methods \(5\-8\) and published standards, is based on the use of a mechanical device \(the Wiperator; Appendix X1\) designed to wipe HITES \[High\-Touch Environmental Surfaces\] under controlled conditions and also to test the transfer of acquired microbial contamination to clean surfaces”* **\[5.1,** p1 **\]**. Maillard’s research forms 7 of 13 research references cited in the ASTM International Standard E2967 document **\[5.1\]**. 

 As well as informing adjustments to the Wiperator® device \(as outlined in Section 2.2\), the inventor of the Wiperator®, Antony Sharpe, noted that “ *Prof. Maillard also was instrumental in testing this new \(MK2\) Wiperator*® *in ring trial with multiple laboratories in Canada and in the UK.  The trial results were successfully published \(Sattar et al.* J Hosp Infect *2015;91:319\-325\) and the Wiperator*®  *MK2 is the equipment mentioned in the ASTMEN2967\-15 standard”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 In addition, Dr Syed Sattar, Professor Emeritus of Microbiology at the University of Ottawa and recipient of the ASTM’s Award of Merit for distinguished service to the standards\-setting organisation, stated: “ *Prof. Maillard was instrumental in approaching sponsors and getting the funding to conduct a multi\-national collaborative to generate data on the reproducibility and repeatability necessary for a standard submission to ASTM International”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 **4.2 Underpinning the commercial growth of GAMA Healthcare \(£8M since 2013\)** 

 GAMA Healthcare is a leading antimicrobial wipe manufacturer in the UK and Australia. Via his research, Maillard identified the superiority of GAMA Healthcare’s wipe products against the pathogen *Clostridioides difficile* **\[3.3\]**. This led to a long\-term collaboration between Cardiff University and GAMA Healthcare, supported via four Knowledge Transfer Partnerships \(KTPs, January 2012 – June 2014, January 2015 – November 2016, February 2016 – April 2019 and May 2018 – present\) from Innovate UK. GAMA Healthcare benefited from Cardiff research in the following ways: 

 **a. Testing GAMA Healthcare’s products to increase profits and ensure these products met new EU regulations** 

 According to Dr Guy Braverman and Dr Teresa Layer from GAMA Healthcare, “ *Cardiff\-led enhancements to the Wiperator® device were instrumental in enabling GAMA to test and develop 18 novel formulations”* and *“Three of the novel formulations developed by GAMA and tested using the refined Wiperator® device were commercialised within eight months of conception, generating at least £1million in their first 2 years on the market for Gama Healthcare”* **\[5.4\]**. 

 By providing the means to test and prove the efficacy of GAMA Healthcare’s products, Maillard enabled GAMA to develop new products, including a product to address biofilm removal in sinks and showers in hospitals, called Clinell Drain Disinfectant **\[5.5\]**. In addition, between May 2015 and March 2019, and via two KTPs, GAMA Healthcare worked with Cardiff University to ensure that its formulations were effective in meeting new EU regulations \(EN13697:2015; EN17126:2018; EN13704:2018; EN14476:2018; EN1499:2013; EN13624:2013; EN14348:2005\) allowing the company to enter new markets within the EU.  As Dr Layer \(GAMA Healthcare’s Science and Innovation Director\) confirmed: “ *The collaboration with Cardiff has enabled GAMA Healthcare to test its products and develop formulations to meet new EU regulatory requirements well ahead of their implementation”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 **b.** **Informing GAMA’s sales and marketing materials** 

 GAMA Healthcare used Cardiff’s robust scientific evidence to drive its sales and marketing activities **\[5.4\]** and to train healthcare professionals in effective use of their products, as stated by Dr Braverman and Dr Layer: “ *An important driver of GAMA’s Healthcare business is also the provision of excellence in product training and usage to Healthcare Professionals.  Data from research collaborations with Cardiff University supporting product claims is referenced in expert marketing materials utilised by GAMA Sales Professionals and is freely available on our website”* **\[5.4\]**. Cardiff research is also cited throughout GAMA Healthcare’s marketing and sales brochures **\[5.6**; p3, **p7**, **5.7**; p3, **5.8**; p3 **\]**. Consequently, GAMA’s global presence grew by over 50% between 2012 and 2017 **\[5.4\]** and the use of Cardiff’s research findings proving the efficacy of their products has allowed GAMA Healthcare to win new business in over 54 international markets including in Europe and Australia **\[5.5\]**. GAMA’s Dr Braverman and Dr Layer confirmed that “ *The research and testing to prove the superiority of GAMA’s sporicidal formulations has led to commercial growth leading to £8.0mn revenue generated since 2013 and growing steadily 13% yoy \[year on year\]”* **\[5.4\]**. 

 **c. Development of GAMA’s in\-house Research and Development \(R&D\) facility** 

 At the start of the collaboration between GAMA Healthcare and Cardiff, GAMA Healthcare’s long\-term ambition was to develop its own R&D facility **\[5.4, 5.5\]**. GAMA’s Managing Director, Dr Braverman stated: “ *The first plan was set out during the first KTP with Cardiff University, and Prof Maillard provided valuable advice and guidance in the establishment of the facility”* **\[5.4\]**. Data provided by Cardiff was used to build a database of its formulations and their effectiveness against different bacteria. This collaboration, alongside GAMA Healthcare’s significant commercial growth, enabled investment of £4M in a new in\-house R&D department in Halifax, Yorkshire **\[5.4, 5.5\]**. This R&D facility currently employees 20 multi\-disciplinary scientists \(with an agreed expansion to a team of 35 in 2021 **\[5.4\]**\) and Dr Braverman and Dr Layer noted that “ *100% of Gama Healthcare’s microbiology staff received training at Cardiff University”* **\[5.4\]**. With this facility in place, GAMA Healthcare can now test its product formulations internally and this has so far resulted in cost savings of £23,000 compared with services offered by external accredited labs **\[5.4\]**. 

 According to Dr Layer, GAMA’s collaboration with Cardiff is “ *a key strategic partnership supporting development of highly innovative new products in the infection prevention and control space”* **\[5.5\]**. GAMA’s Chief Executive Officer \(and Managing Director\) Dr Braverman also summarised the benefit of Cardiff’s research for GAMA Healthcare as follows: “ *This partnership has included developing rigorous testing methods, product development and commercialisation, academic publications, training and knowledge transfer”* and he added that the collaboration *“has been a core part of our growth and success”* **\[5.9\]**. 

 In summary, Cardiff research underpinned a new ASTM International Standard for testing and use of antimicrobial wipes and played a significant role in driving competitive advantage and commercial growth of a leading anti\-bacterial wipe manufacturer, GAMA Healthcare. Cardiff research additionally led to improved infection control measures globally, helping to minimise healthcare acquired infections.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Chell’s research regarding composite measurement of entrepreneurial behaviours has resulted in development of a reliable and simple online tool able to assess entrepreneurial behaviours. This tool, which recognises, assesses, and develops the behaviours of innovators and entrepreneurs, is the core offering of Enploy Ltd, a UK start\-up company. The business, which has secured investment funding of GBP147,500, and grown from zero turnover to an income over GBP86,000, has utilised this tool in an innovation community support programme and is a core offering of its business. Enploy has also run Learning and Development courses at companies including Barclays Bank, the Co\-op, Gymshark, and charity UnLtd. These workshops and programmes have developed individual’s mindsets, enhanced management skills and improved working cultures.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 New, innovative, growing businesses are essential for sustaining and growing the national economy, yet many new businesses fail. Thus, enaction of a successful entrepreneurial personality is of vital importance for individuals and their employees, as it is for the wider economy. The nature of entrepreneurship and the identification of entrepreneurial characteristics is a more controversial topic. One approach to defining entrepreneurship is through its practical application, by asking how people with entrepreneurial tendencies behave and how these behaviours can be reliably assessed. 

 In 2008, Chell proposed that an ‘entrepreneurial personality’ is a socially constructed phenomenon but also presents consistency in terms of behaviours and skills **\[R1\]**. She reviewed and brought together approaches from across the social sciences, supported with real world case studies, to collect and evaluate the purported traits of entrepreneurship.  Additionally, she explored the extent to which psychometricians have developed tools for assessing these characteristics. 

 Concurrently, Chell and Innovation Foundation Nesta worked together to define the nature of innovation skills **\[R2\]**. NESTA commissioned Chell, with a grant of GBP119,000, develop an assessment tool to measure the innovative capacity of young people. She and her team reviewed past literature and developed a tool to assess their findings. Recognising the common denominators between innovators through a literature review, they identified five skills \(Creativity, Self\-Efficacy, Energy, Risk Propensity, and Leadership\) in young people which were required to become an innovator in the future. As well as showing these skills could be learnt, they also proposed these skills could be measured. The Youth Innovation Skills Measurement Tool \(YISMT\) was developed to robustly assess innovative behaviours, which are a subset of enterprising tendencies and entrepreneurship. The YISMT was piloted and tested at four types of schools, across the 14\-19 age range, which improved the reliability and validity of the measures. In the main study, the YISMT was administered to 811 pupils from seven institutions and correctly identified more innovative pupils. Further insights were also gathered on how to develop innovative behaviours, through focus groups and interviews with staff and pupils **\[R3\]**. The findings showed how different contexts shaped behavioural expression and how to maximize motivation and opportunities for development. 

 Enploy Ltd, a Learning and Development consultancy, approached Chell to develop a tool which assessed entrepreneurial behaviours in those of graduate age or older. She carried out a review of the concept of ‘skill’ **\[R4\]**: distinguishing skills from competencies; exploring the problems of identifying an entrepreneurial skillset; and advocating for a better understanding of the multidimensional nature of particular skills – especially risk\-taking propensity. Enabled to target an older sample more accurately, Chell detailed the key behaviours as: Proactivity, Risk\-taking Propensity, Creativity, Leadership, Self\-Efficacy, and Emotional Intelligence **\[R1, R5\]**. Measures for these behaviours were incorporated into the new tool. Leadership and Emotional Intelligence were included as dimensions primarily of managerial capability. 

 The tool was further developed by a small team, including Chell, with around 1500 respondents. Tests for internal consistency \(Cronbach’s alpha > 0.8 for four of the measures, 0.764 for Self\-Efficacy\) suggested that it was reliable as a measurement of the entrepreneurial personality as whole. The validity of the tool was tested using criteria such as ‘I am determined to create a firm in the future’, which demonstrated good predictive value – especially from measures of Proactivity, Risk\-taking Propensity, and Creativity. A new cohort of 476 respondents was used to establish the normal exhibition of each behaviour, and thus ready the tool to best impact upon the cognitive, affective, and behavioural learning of future clients

 The Office of National Statistics highlights that a four\-year survival rate for new businesses hovers around 50%. Enploy has thrived for over four years; employing two full\-time staff, a part\-time non\-executive director, and a part\-time trainer. 

 Enploy’s activity is dependent on the research produced with Chell regarding entrepreneurial behaviours. Enploy reaches out to its clients by showcasing the tool as ‘an online diagnostic to identify strengths and growth opportunities’, advertising its ability ‘to enable you to screen for potential, enhance employability, and provide advice on entrepreneurship’ **\[S1\]**. It also details that identified skills will be developed. Highlighting Chell’s role in the development and success of Enploy, the Operations Director describes how Chell ‘ *worked with us in designing the measure of Entrepreneurship*’; and noted that ‘ *the Enploy team were thrilled with the tool and the value it offered to learners*.’ **\[S2\]** The Managing Director \(Enploy\), reflected that, from 2016\-2020: 

 ‘*What the tool has successfully achieved is a way of potential customers and clients thinking about entrepreneurial behaviours by reflecting on their own strengths and weaknesses in these areas. Over the past few years, the tool has helped open sales conversations, as well as being a great asset to use in workshops*.’ **\[S3\]** 

 Through the tool, and other programmes, participants were, for the first time, able to: 

-  identify specific attributes associated with entrepreneurial behaviour, 

-  reflect and build self\-awareness about their skillset, 

-  consider how to enhance their work through development of their entrepreneurial skills. 

 <ins>The Tool: Starting\-Up Enploy</ins> 

 The Tool was first marketed commercially in 2017, when Enploy conducted a pilot \(GBP1,400\) with Barclays Bank, involving 70 participants from their Degree Apprenticeship Programme. Three workshops were also run with the charity UnLtd as part of its Uprising’s Fasteners programme, which supports 18–25\-year\-olds looking to develop skills for work life. This led to UnLtd awarding two grants; ‘a Do\-It Award \(GBP4500\) in 2017, and a Grow\-It Award \(GBP15,000\) in 2018, in addition to further work with twelve 18\-25 year olds in the Youth Employment Programme in 2019. 

 A 10\-week blended learning programme \(GBP2,500\) was delivered for 24 graduates within Enploy’s local university entrepreneurial development programme. The participants described how they gained ‘ *insight of where your weaknesses are*’ and became ‘ *more aware of potential opportunities I wouldn’t have seen before*’ **\[S4\]**. 

 Innovation Birmingham \(a community of over 170 digital start\-ups\) have used Enploy to enhance their incubator programme ‘Entrepreneurs for the Future \(E4F\)’ \(GBP6000\). Enploy’s tool fills a gap in the E4F programme \- which previously missed development opportunities at the level of the individual \- by bolstering mentoring through integrating the online diagnostic into the E4F personal growth platform. Innovation Birmingham have valued the demonstrable influences that Enploy has on aspiring entrepreneurs, with dedicated sessions for young women in digital start\-ups **\[S5\]**. 

 <ins>The Tool: Scaling\-Up Enploy</ins> 

 In April 2018, Enploy received an investment of GDP147,500 seed funding from entrepreneurial investment firm, Jensen Funding Partners **\[S5, S6\]**. This enabled Enploy to grow its product offering and sales, allowing the company to double its staff. Enploy was also awarded a place on the PwC SCALE Midlands programme – which supports high potential business, where they were able to present to over 200 senior executives **\[S5\]**. They were invited back the following year to deliver a group masterclass on entrepreneurial mindset to the 2019 cohort of businesses. 

 Work continued with Barclays, supporting learners in the Chartered Manager Degree Apprenticeship programme in their understanding of enterprise and entrepreneurship, in both 2018 and 2019. Workshops were also held with food retailer the Co\-op, with 37 individuals in their Chartered Manager Degree Apprenticeship trained to become future leaders. Other expansions included entrepreneurial sessions at Wasps and Worcester rugby clubs. In partnership with the Rugby Players Association, Enploy led a series of interactive workshops and e\-learning courses **\[S7\]**. 

 In 2018, Enploy designed an 8\-week programme for Gymshark, the highly innovative and exponentially growing, fitness apparel brand. As a consequence of the success of those courses, Enploy created a bespoke six\-month, accredited programme to train 40 members of Gymshark’s Customer Support Team. They also included a train\-the\-trainer package to transfer the knowledge to the Gymshark training managers. Reports, using Officevibe metrics to define employee engagement, were conducted either side of the programme. They showed large increases around the quality and frequency of feedback \(up 17%\) and of recognition \(15%\), employees’ happiness at work \(up 11%\), and how employees align themselves with the company’s values \(11%\). Given Gymshark’s tagline ‘be a visionary’, increasing alignment demonstrates the growth of entrepreneurial mindsets amongst Gymshark’s employees **\[S8\]**. 

 In 2019, Enploy carried out ‘Growth Mindset Masterclasses’ and ‘Vision & Values’ workshops for the internal team at UBCUK Ltd – a major provider of serviced office space in the UK. Reflecting on UBCUK’s involvement with Enploy, the Managing Director of UBCUK noted that, ‘ *It's added value to everyone irrespective of whether you're an emerging leader or not. It reminds you of some real key skills or if you haven't used them before, it teaches you some new skills’* **\[S9\]**. These sessions supported UBCUK to develop their vision and mission statement and to facilitate creative thinking **\[S10\]**.  This demonstrates how Enploy not only develops individual employees but also businesses and their futures.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 An award\-winning fleet planning company began exploiting Heriot\-Watt University optimization research in 2014, leading to the following impacts: 

1.  Economic: GBP11,650,000 investment and B2B income, plus GBP9,600,000 estimated gains for end\-users, four jobs created \(15 person\-years in the period\). 

1.  Environmental: the associated cloud service was launched August 2018 and by end 2020 had reduced CO2 emissions by approx. 3,000 tonnes and started recruiting nationwide home delivery fleets. 

1.  Policy: founded on results of an associated project, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development now recommend asset\-sharing platforms in their guidelines for freight procurement. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Commercial users of optimisation almost invariably use standard single\-objective tools, which treat optimisation as the requirement to minimise a single objective, such as ‘cost’. However, this is increasingly regarded as suboptimal, since the ‘single objective’ formalisation distorts the underlying problem, and the optimizer will often miss solutions that would have been preferable. Rather than a cost\-minimizing solution, for example, a vehicle fleet manager may prefer a plan using fewer vehicles, or providing a fairer balance between drivers’ working hours, better utilization of electric vehicles, and so forth. 

 Much of our research has been on algorithms for multi\-objective optimization, which avoid distorting the underlying task, and deliver solutions that straddle the inherent trade\-offs, providing more value and insight to the decision\-maker. Early algorithms in this area were slower than their single\-objective counterparts, however we are responsible for some of the more widely cited, faster and effective algorithms. In particular, they explore theoretical issues and algorithm design in the context of *many\-objective* optimization \[3.1,3.2\]. While research in this area tends to focus on problems with typically 2 or 3 ‘headline’ objectives \(e.g. cost and risk\), the Many\-Objective Optimization \(MOO\) area recognizes that \(arguably\) most optimization tasks involve 4\-10, or even more, conflicting objectives. 

 Our MOO research has included theoretical work, to build an understanding of the consequent algorithm design challenges \[3.1\], and algorithm design work, in particular reference \[3.2\], which presents an effective algorithm for problems with 5\-20 objectives. The technical challenge in many\-objective optimization relates largely to the difficulty in assigning relative quality among groups of candidate solutions, since they will often be ‘mutually non\-dominated’. The work in \[3.2\] published in 2007 at the primary conference in evolutionary computation, GECCO found an approach to assigning quality in such circumstances that was relatively efficient and outperformed rival methods. The paper was awarded the “2017 ACM SIGEVO Impact award”; which recognises “…papers published in the GECCO conference 10 years earlier, which are both highly cited and deemed to be seminal” \( [https://tinyurl.com/ds4xnvp4](https://tinyurl.com/ds4xnvp4)\). 

 During our collaboration with Route Monkey Ltd \(RML\) \[3.3\], we developed further refinements of \[3.2\] for real\-world vehicle fleet planning tasks \(broadly known as Vehicle Routing Problems \(VRPs\). Real\-world VRPs are inherently many\-objective, \(e.g. cost, mileage, emissions, time, CO2, resources\-used, etc.\), and we found that our approach reliably outperformed leading commercial software, even in terms of the standard single\-objective targets of mileage or cost. 

 Finally, from late 2015, we worked with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development \(WBCSD\) on horizontal collaboration between freight operators. Such collaboration has the potential for substantial savings in CO2 emissions, however is hard to achieve in a business context. With WBCSD, we exploited the aforementioned research, with adaptations for business collaboration models. The findings \[5.1\] were the basis of an innovate UK project \[3.4\] which went on to co\-develop algorithms for multi\-fleet asset sharing and an associated business model which could cope effectively with the often disproportionate utilisation of assets that arises in optimised multi\-fleet solutions \[3.5\].

###  3. References to the research 

 The CS/logistics impact case study is underpinned by three research publications.  \[3.1\] and \[3.2\] respectively underpin the theoretical and practical aspects of the research that led to all of the environmental and economic impacts. \[3.1\] is published in the primary international medium for its specialized research area; \[3.2\] is published in what is regarded the top conference in the wider research area and is regarded as seminal \(and explicitly indicated as such by an award\). The study also has policy impact that arises from the same overall body of work, and is best represented \(in terms of underpinning\) by the research published in \[3.5\] \(co\-authored by a team from the 'Connected Places Catapult', and in an open\-access international journal\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In 2014, Route Monkey Ltd \(RML\), was establishing a reputation for innovation in fleet software, developing business plans around the vision of a fast/flexible ‘online scheduler’, and radically simplifying fleets’ access to optimisation capability. RML adopted Corne’s research to help realise these plans, and a series of associated Innovate UK, EU and B2B projects began in October 2014 \[3.5\]. One project in this HWU/RML partnership explored multi\-fleet collaboration, leading ultimately to policy impact; meanwhile, others transformed RML’s technology portfolio, setting the stage for RML’s acquisition in 2015/16 by Trakm8 PLC, who sustained the HWU partnership, and launched ‘Vortex’ \(incorporating Corne’s algorithms\) in August 2018. Associated impacts are outlined below. 

  

 **Environmental:** Trakm8 released the ‘Vortex’ API in August 2018, incorporating the research and underpinning their optimization service \( [https://www.trakm8.com/optimisation](https://www.trakm8.com/optimisation)\). Vortex is used for new clients since August 2018, while gradually migrating pre\-existing clients. Daily emissions savings accumulate, which can be estimated as follows: Before Vortex, we can estimate that fleets would have used, on average, 10% additional mileage. This is more conservative than the 12.5% estimated gains from top\-tier optimization across diverse fleets \[3.1\], which takes into account that some may previously have used optimization services. This translates into reduced CO2 emissions, mitigating pollution and climate change, and contributing to the UK’s CO2 targets. Meanwhile in 2017 RML commissioned an estimate revealing savings of c. 2,200 tonnes per month \(from 3,240,000 miles saved per month\) across its customer base \( [https://tinyurl.com/rmlest](https://tinyurl.com/rmlest)\). Since August 2018, around 5% of pre\-existing RML customers have migrated to Vortex, suggesting further reduced emissions of 110 tonnes per month, accumulating to c. 3,000 tonnes by end 2020. Meanwhile some very significant fleets will adopt vortex in 2021 on the basis of proven benefits beyond their current service \[5.1\]. These include two top\-10 supermarkets accounting for over 90,000,000 home\-delivery miles p.a. The latter projects and associated product confidence contribute to pre\-2021 Trakm8\-based economic impact, as presented below. 

###  Economic Impacts 

 <ins>Route Monkey Ltd / The Algorithm People Ltd \(TAP\):</ins> In 2015, Trakm8 PLC acquired RML for GBP7,100,000 \(for a consideration of up to GBP9,100,000\); this investment was driven in large part by the distinctive and novel algorithm capabilities, and associated development roadmap, afforded by engagement with Corne’s group, which also enabled RML to leverage further R&D and private funding summing to approx. GBP3,000,000, and enabling \~15 additional person years of employment in technical positions. RML’s CEO went on to found TAP, which raised GBP1,300,000 to develop its novel pay\-as\-you\-go online scheduling platform ‘My Transport Planner’, which makes use of vortex \[5.2\]. 

 <ins>Trakm8 PLC:</ins> associated economic impacts for Trakm8 can be quantified in terms of jobs created in connection with the Vortex API service, and associated project income from a number of IUK and B2B projects, on topics ranging from integration/deployment of Vortex through to specific consultancy tasks that exploit Vortex. Trakm8 estimate these impacts \(until end 2020\) as: project income: GBP250,000; creating 4 jobs \[5.1\]. 

 <ins>End Users:</ins> where case studies have been done by Trakm8 PLC on the impact of Vortex on individual customers reports include, e.g., savings of GBP150,000 p.a. for a charity’s transport costs \[5.3\], and 10% savings on fuel costs along with 30% improved driver productivity for Iceland Foods Ltd \[5.4\]. Estimating economic benefits across all end users is confounded by the variety of ways that end\-users exploit increased plan efficiency; however a lower bound can be suggested, based on cost\-per\-mile of the most fuel\-efficient diesel vans \(11p \-  [https://tinyurl.com/fuelppm](https://tinyurl.com/fuelppm)\). Assuming 3,240,000 vehicle miles per month saved to December 2020 \(RML estimate noted above\), the resulting figure is GBP9,600,000 \[5.1\]. 

 **Policy Impacts** 

 The WBCSD is an organization in Geneva, funded by businesses globally and by the World Bank, advising businesses and influencing policy globally around sustainable practices. Corne’s research on asset\-sharing was central to two reports from the WBCSD’s Low\-Carbon Freight working group, and also underpins \(via the FSL project\), procurement guidelines for freight operators published by the WBCSD’s ‘Transforming Heavy Transport’ project. 

 The first WBCSD report \[5.5\] was built around Corne’s research as part of the Low Carbon Freight working group, and co\-authored by the consortium, including Nestle, UPS, and Scania, promoting non\-trivial horizontal asset sharing among fleets \(i.e. beyond simply ‘backhaul’\) as one of the more significant measures to be recommended for reducing emissions. Meanwhile, the freight procurement guidelines \(WBCSD report 2\) is a deliverable of the WBCSD’s ‘Transforming Heavy Transport’ initiative, which brings together 20 global transport organizations to guide the sector towards zero emissions by 2050 \[5.6\]. 

 Additionally the WBCSD report from the World Business Council’s ‘Transforming Heavy Transport’ project, Sep 2019; “ *provides professionals engaged in logistics procurement, supply chain and logistics management, and logistics emissions management with action\-based guidance on how to reduce greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions and air pollutants from their freight transport and logistics procurement practices*”; the report describes the ‘Freightshare Lab Asset sharing platform”, an outcome of the Innovate UK project \[3.4\], as an exemplar and a signpost to best practice that is “ *applicable to all companies*” \[5.6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Giovannetti’s research on competitors’ cooperation and networks has led to: 

-  The United Nations’ International Telecommunication Union \(ITU\) adopting new practices for collecting and analysing data on 125 countries’ cooperative platforms, and using this data to inform their global ICT policies and governance. 

-  A set of new policy recommendations, published by the ITU, on the impact of collaboration in innovation ecosystems detailing how best to bring connectivity to the 50% of the world population that has no internet access. 

-  A set of recommendations published by the UK’s Department of Business Innovation and Skills \(BIS\), for improving productivity. These were endorsed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \(OECD\). 

-  The drafting and adoption of the Digital Sector Strategy of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority \(CPCA\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Giovannetti’s research focuses on internet market power and the adoption of new technologies. Two sub\-themes of this research, conducted at Anglia Ruskin University since 2011, have focused on: 

1.  the innovation outcomes of cooperation between otherwise competing organizations \( **R1, R2**\), and 

1.  new indicators to assess the market power and success of organisations in the digital sector \( **R3\-6**\). 

 These areas of research are deeply interconnected. The internet and related information and communications technologies \(ICTs\) foster technological adoption and the diffusion of innovations, which are necessary for sustainable economic development, both locally and nationally. Both sub\-themes are discussed separately as they have led to distinct impact with global reach and significance \(Section 4\). 

 The first area of impact is underpinned by results obtained in **R1** and **R2**. These publications provide: 

-  an empirical analysis of the impact of cooperation in innovative activities on innovation rates and productivity \( **R1,** with Piga, Keele University\) 

-  a theoretical analysis of the incentives for market competitors in their adoption of new technologies \( **R2**\). 

 Empirical findings in **R1** stem from a research project led by Giovannetti \(PI\): “Investigating external and private benefits of investments in UK skills & training”. This research was funded by the UK Department for Business Innovation and Skills \(BIS\) \(BIS/RBU/025/2012 **; S1**\) to develop an econometric model using data from multiple UK Innovation Surveys. The analysis shows that collaboration in innovative activities among non\-competing organisations, including customers and suppliers, is an essential element for success. Having said that, the research did also show that inter\-competitor cooperation could also slow innovation, as competitors either agree to stall innovations or waste resources on duplicating innovation. Hence, regulatory authorities should seek to set incentives and policies that only support productive collaboration within innovation ecosystems. 

 These empirical results complement theoretical insights obtained in **R2,** which applies game theory to identify the incentives that lead to different levels of technological adoption among regional neighbouring market competitors. This framework shows that global adoption of a new technology does not emerge where there is strong market competition between firms, especially when there is a high level of market integration facilitated by ICTs. The disincentives to adopt innovations provoked by strong competition should be addressed when designing innovation and sector policies, which would facilitate greater levels of innovation diffusion and reduce the persistence of regional technological inequalities. 

 The second area of research, drawing from results analysing complex network features in underpinning publications **R3\-6**, has led to the development of novel empirical indicators for predicting crowdfunding success and in identifying market power within ICT platforms. These publications showed: 

  

-  The key role played by *network centrality* in capturing market power in Mobile Internet connectivity \( **R3**, with Sigloch, PhD student at ARU\) and within Internet exchange facilities \( **R4**, with D'Ignazio, Bank of Italy\) 

-  The positive impact on the success of digital crowdfunding platforms from investing in *digital* *social capital*, through reciprocal support and shared social networks amongst crowdfunding projects \( **R5**, with Davies, PhD student at ARU\) 

-  The positive impact of levels of *trust* on the technical stability of the global Internet, whereby trust is built by maintaining long\-lasting interconnections among Internet operators \( **R6**, with D'Ignazio, Bank of Italy\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Giovannetti’s research on the innovation outcomes of cooperation between competing organizations, and on indicators of market power and success of organisations in the digital sector have resulted in impact with global reach and significance across four main domains: 

###  Developing and facilitating global ICT policy 

 New data on the cooperative platforms of 125 countries were collected, analysed and used to inform global ICTs policies and governance by the UN’s International Telecommunication Union \(ITU\). Founded in 1865 to facilitate international connectivity in communications networks, the ITU is now the UN agency dedicated to ICTs. The ITU includes 193 Member States as well as some 900 companies, universities, and international and regional organizations. The ITU allocates global radio spectrum and satellite orbits, develops the technical standards that ensure networks and technologies seamlessly interconnect, and strives to improve access to ICTs for underserved communities worldwide under the UN mandate to ‘bridge the digital divide’. To this aim, the ITU works with public and private sector partners to ensure that ICT access and services are affordable, equitable and universal and are empowering people around the world through technology education and training. The ITU also regularly publishes the industry’s most comprehensive and reliable ICT international statistics. 

 Much of the work at ITU is done in study groups. The main output of a study group is the establishment of technical standards or guidelines and recommendations.  Giovannetti’s underpinning research \( **R1\-6**\) led to his election as Vice\-rapporteur of the ITU’s Telecommunication Development Sector’s \(ITU\-D\) *Study Group 1*. In this role, he revised the ITU *Annual Tariff Policies Survey,* proposing the inclusion of a set of new questions on countries’ modes of access to, and governance of, Internet Exchange Points \(IXPs\) and National Research and Education Networks \(NREs\). These were two further types of Digital Exchange Platforms used for enhancing cooperation among Internet Service Providers and Universities and research centres, that form an essential component of strategies aimed at lowering costs and increasing the affordability of internet access in developing countries **\(S3\)**. 

 The resulting datasets are now available on the ITU Statistics website, ICT\-Eye, and have been used in global and regional level forums, to discuss global trends in regulation for Sector Members and other national and international stakeholders. For the year 2019, more than 125 datapoints have been collected world\-wide, based on the member states’ answers to these new questions **\(S2\)** and this data is now referenced and used in ITU’s Study Group official reports informing and advising member states on best practice for lowering the costs of interconnection policies **\(S3\)**. Elaborations, visualisations and guidelines on interconnection through shared infrastructures such as IXPs and NREs, based on these new survey data, are included in the ITU\-D Study Group 1 Report on “Question 4/1: Economic policies and methods of determining the costs of services related to national telecommunication/ICT networks.” This report, co\-edited by Professor Giovannetti in his role as Vice\-Rapporteur of the ITU\-D Study Group1, referring to **\(R4\)** regarding the relevance of IXPs in lowering connectivity costs in developing countries, was submitted and approved as *ITU\-D Document 1/355\-E* **\(S3\)** during the 3<sup>rd</sup> Plenary meeting of Study Group 1 \(Geneva, 19 February 2020 \- attended by 182 delegates from 62 countries\) and is being translated into the six official UN languages for final publication, after being finalised at the Plenary Study Group 1, Rapporteurs virtual meeting, \(hosted in Geneva, 21 September 2020, *ITU\-D Document SG1RGQ/325* **\(S3\)**\). 

###  Improving global connectivity 

 Giovannetti’s research has led to a new set of policy recommendations published by the ITU. These have informed global public debates on the impact of collaboration in innovation ecosystems and how best to bring connectivity to the 50% of the world population without internet access **\(R1\-4\)**. 

 In 2016, Giovannetti was invited by the then ITU\-D Director, Mr Sanou **\(S4\)** to join the expert academic group and write a chapter \(“Digital Divide and Digital Multiplier: A Paradigm Shift through Innovation **” \(S4\)**\) for an ITU volume setting out a roadmap to achieve the ICT\-related targets of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals \(SDGs\). The volume was launched at the Buenos Aires Ministerial Roundtable, held at the 2017 World Telecommunication Development Conference \(WTDC\-17\) on ""ICT for Sustainable Development Goals \(ICT4SDG\)"". This conference was attended by more than 1,360 participants, including 1,010 government delegates representing more than 130 countries **\(S4\).** Drawing on his underpinning research **\(R1\-4\)**, Giovannetti’s chapter **\(S4\)** provides a new set of policy recommendations for how best to support sustainable ICT\-centric innovation ecosystems. These recommendations were republished in the *ITU\-News* Magazine **\(S5\)**, emphasising their potential to inform policies for reducing the digital divide. In addition, the World Economic Forum published an article on the specific recommendations focussing on crowdfunding success titled “These are the things that successful crowdfunding projects do” **\(S6\)** based on Giovannetti and Davies’ underpinning research **\(R5\)**. 

 Evidence of the reach of this ITU published volume, that includes Giovannetti’s policy recommendations **\(S4\),** is provided by it being referenced in: 

-  Jordan’s ICT Sectorial Strategy \(Gedeon and Al\-Qasem, 2019\), prepared by The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit \(GIZ\) for the Jordanian Ministry of Industry, Trade and Supply 

-  the UNESCO Policy Paper \(2019\) “ICT for Sustainable Development. Recommendations for Public Policies that Guarantee Rights”. 

 As a follow\-up on the regulatory implications of Giovannetti’s underpinning research \( **R1\-6\),** he also co\-chaired the ITU\-D workshop on the “Economic Impact of the Over the Top applications \(OTT\)” \(Geneva September 2019\). This workshop led to a dedicated report published as official *ITU\-D Document 1/339\-E* \- “Economic impact of OTTs on national telecommunication/ ICT markets” **\(S3\).** This report, co\-edited by Giovannetti and formally adopted at the Plenary assembly on 22 February 2020 **\(S3\)** has been published by the ITU in the six official UN languages. The document draws together lessons learned from the research to inform the development of regulatory guidelines internationally. 

###  Improving UK productivity 

 Giovannetti’s research has led to a set of recommendations for the UK Department of Business Innovation and Skills \(BIS\), subsequently endorsed by the OECD, for improving UK productivity. 

 The results and policy recommendations explored in the BIS funded project were published in December 2014 as a *BIS Research paper n 203* **\(S1\)**. This examined innovation enablers, with a focus on targeted subsidies and incentives for R&D and training activities in key sectors. Giovannetti was involved, as Principal investigator, in the design of the project, and, according to Simon McKee of the BIS Skills and Policy Analysis unit, “Giovannetti worked closely with myself and other colleagues to define the scope of work, to ensure that it was useful from the perspective of government policymakers” \(BIS 2014 **, S1**\). 

 The report and its results filled an important gap in understanding and enabled new capabilities for modelling innovation data and their impact on productivity. This was shown by the highly influential “OECD UK Productivity Report” **\(S7\)** presenting a set of recommendations on how to improve UK productivity. This cited Giovannetti’s *BIS Research paper n 203* **\(S1\)** as one of only four publications considered **key** **references** underpinning their policy recommendations on UK productivity. The results of the BIS model showing the potential negative impact of cooperation in innovative activities among product competitors, were also presented at a dedicated meeting with the BIS Skills & Training team on 12 May 2014, and to the *UK Innovation Survey User Group* at BEIS on 20 March 2017. The findings were also discussed through ten separate one\-to\-one meetings between 2015 and 2017 held by Giovannetti with key policymakers, facilitated by Giovannetti’s participation in the University of Cambridge *Centre for Science and Policy’s* Policy Fellows Network **\(S8\).** 

###  Introducing local digital strategy 

 Giovannetti’s research has contributed to the writing and adoption of the 2019 Digital Sector Strategy \(DSS\) by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority \(CPCA\). 

 The DSS is a central component of the Local Industrial Strategy \(LIS\) adopted by the CPCA. The role of the DSS is to ensure that the area continues to be economically competitive through the success of the digital sector and through the adoption and diffusion of smart technologies. Giovannetti’s input was through two distinct leading roles: 

-  as a member of the Steering Commission for the DSS, and, 

-  as the academic lead for the Anglia Ruskin University and Cambridge Wireless strategy team that won the bid to write the DSS. 

 The DSS report is based on consultation with, and a survey of, multiple organisations and businesses involved in the Digital sector. The design of the consultation and survey were informed by Giovannetti’s previous research \( **R1, R4 and R5**\). The DSS **\(S9\)** recommendations were also directly informed by Giovannetti’s underpinning research; his previous research being explicitly cited in them. The DSS was adopted by the CPCA on 15 March 2019 and was then integrated into the wider CPCA LIS in September 2019 **\(S9\).** The importance of this work is emphasised by the Mayor of CPCA, James Palmer, who said that “The first Local Industrial Strategy for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough will help create the conditions to achieve our ambition of doubling economic output and ensuring future prosperity” **\(S10\).** 

 The report is directly shaping regional policy. Acting on the report’s recommendations, the CPCA is investing, through the programme CambWifi, in providing free public access Wifi in market towns across Huntingdonshire to help residents keep connected and bolster local businesses through the Covid pandemic. On 8 October 2020, CambWifi went live in St Neots, and is being extended to St Ives, Ramsey and Huntingdon town centres. The secure public access Wifi network is being rolled out as part of the Connecting Cambridgeshire programme through the collaboration and investment of local authorities, Cambridgeshire County Council with the support of Huntingdonshire District Council, and additional funding for market towns from Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Combined Authority. Welcoming the launch of free CambWifi, CPCA’s Mayor James Palmer said: “Public access Wifi has an important part to play in supporting struggling high streets and will help to bolster economic recovery from Covid\-19 by encouraging people to shop locally and to support local businesses. The Combined Authority is investing in digital connectivity for our market towns now and for the future.”

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Through his engagement with professional and public audiences at galleries, major arts festivals, and literary events, as well as through extensive press and media coverage, Read’s research has demonstrably enriched the public and critical understanding of the interplay between art and literature during the first half of the twentieth century. Focusing on the creative interaction between poets and artists in early twentieth\-century France, Read’s work has also helped to shape the conception and design of two highly successful exhibitions in Paris: *Apollinaire: Le regard du poète* \(Musée de l’Orangerie, 2016\) and *Picasso: Sculptures* \(Musée Picasso\-Paris, 2015\-16\), which together were seen by 580,000 visitors. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Read has established himself as one of the world’s leading experts on Apollinaire and visual art, having written about the poet for many decades. After publishing the major study *Picasso and Apollinaire: The Persistence of Memory* \(2008\) **\[R1\]** and editing *Guillaume Apollinaire, Correspondance avec les artistes, 1903\-1918* \(2009\) **\[R2\]**, in 2014 Read was invited by Laurence des Cars, then Director of the Musée de l’Orangerie in Paris \(now Director of the Musée d’Orsay\), to join four French colleagues on the Advisory Committee of the exhibition *Apollinaire: Le regard du poète* \(6 April to 18 July 2016\). Working with a team of curators and art experts, Read was given access to the uncatalogued archives of the Musée de l’Orangerie, to research his edition of the correspondence between Apollinaire and art dealer Paul Guillaume, published jointly by Gallimard/Musée de l’Orangerie to coincide with the exhibition **\[R3\]**. Additionally, Read contributed three essays to the exhibition catalogue \(awarded the 2016 Prix Catalpa, an annual prize for the best Paris exhibition catalogue\), one of which was the transcription of a previously unpublished four\-page manuscript by Matisse that he had identified among Apollinaire’s papers **\[R4\]**. 

 Throughout 2015 and 2016, Read worked in archives, private collections, and auction records, selecting, dating, and transcribing manuscripts and other documents for *Apollinaire. Lettres, calligrammes, manuscrits*, his major book on the poet’s life and writings, co\-published by the French National Library in November 2016 **\[R5\]**. Building on this, Read published an essay in the leading French journal *Europe* on Apollinaire and the art critic Adolphe Basler, as well as a substantial Introduction for a bilingual anthology of Apollinaire’s poems, translated by the award\-winning poet Ron Padgett and published by the New York Review of Books. 

 Alongside his work on Apollinaire, Read also researched new material on Picasso. Two seminars on cubism at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC \(October 2013 and April 2014\) enabled Read to launch a sustained campaign of research on *Parade*, the 1917 Cocteau\-Picasso\-Satie ‘Cubist’ ballet. In the papers of the Russian poet and dancer Boris Kochno, held in the Music Department of the Bibliothèque nationale de France \(BnF\) and the archives of the Paris Opera \(Palais Garnier\), Read located and transcribed Jean Cocteau’s 1917 Italian notebook and other unpublished documents, which he incorporated into a substantial essay on *Parade*, included in *The Cubism Seminars* **\[R6\]**. 

 Among his many other publications on modernist literature and art, in 2017\-18 Read published six further essays on painting, sculpture, and literature in catalogues for major exhibitions on Picasso at the Fondation Leclerc in Landerneau \(summer 2017\) and Museu Picasso Barcelona \(2018\), on André Derain \(2017\), and on Cubism \(2018\) \(both at Centre Pompidou, Paris\), as well as eight entries in an associated *Dictionnaire du cubisme* \(2018\). All these publications place Read’s work at the cutting\-edge of research into the relationship between art and literature in the modernist period.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Informing curatorial practice: conception and design of two major exhibitions in Paris** 

 ‘Due to the remarkable quality of his research on modern French literature, and in particular on Guillaume Apollinaire’, in 2014 Read was invited by Laurence des Cars, President of the Musée d’Orsay / Musée de l’Orangerie, to join the Scientific Committee of *Apollinaire: Le regard du poète* **\[a\]**. This exhibition was held at the Musée de l’Orangerie in Paris between 6 April and 18 July 2016 and attracted 234,688 visitors over 88 days. According to the *Musée d’Orsay’s Annual Report 2016*, this was the Orangerie’s most visited exhibition in 2016 **\[c\]**. Confirming the importance of Read’s contribution, des Cars wrote that, ‘\[his\] work in our Scientific Committee played a significant role in both the critical and public success of the exhibition’ **\[a\]**. 

 As part of the small advisory committee, on account of his ‘dual role as historian of both literature and art’ **\[e\]**, Read’s research directly informed the practice of the curators by shaping the conceptual scope of the exhibition and providing expertise on the interface between Apollinaire and the artists. According to des Cars: ‘Read played an essential role in the choice of artists and works presented in the exhibition, identifying the artists promoted by Apollinaire and the works that he collected or wrote about’ **\[a\]**. 

 Read worked closely with the curators to establish the agenda for loan request and specifically identified works by Picasso to illustrate the painter’s relationship to Apollinaire. His research on the American sculptor Cecil Howard enabled the curatorial team to contact the sculptor’s grandson to obtain the loan of cubist polychrome sculptures **\[a\]**. According to Laurent Le Bon, the President of the Musée Picasso\-Paris \(which collaborated with the Musée d’Orsay on the exhibition\), Read brought ‘an unequalled knowledge of the relations between Apollinaire and the artistic circles of his time, as well as of the poet's activities as a cultural commentator and promoter of the arts’ **\[b\]**. According to the Directors of the Centre Pompidou and the Musée National d’Art Moderne \(MNAM\), Read’s contribution to both the exhibition and the catalogue was ‘decisive’, with his ‘renown among both scholarly circles and the wider public \[…\] having a considerable impact on the status and success of the exhibition’ **\[e\]**. 

 Read also ‘played a decisive role in the interdisciplinary conception of the exhibition’ **\[b\]** through ‘discussions about the interdisciplinary character of Apollinaire’s activities, which ranged from cinema, painting, sculpture, illustrated books, visual poetry, sound recordings, and puppet theatre’ **\[a\]**. By underlining the importance in Apollinaire’s cultural landscape of Russian and Ukrainian artists, notably Larionov and Goncharova, as well as ‘enriching \[the curators’\] reflection on the importance that Apollinaire attributed to African and Australasian art’, Read helped to shape the exhibition and its focus on Apollinaire’s international networks and interests **\[a, b\]**. According to the Directors of the Centre Pompidou and MNAM: ‘The direction that Peter Read \[…\] gave to the exhibition and the accompanying catalogue has profoundly modified the knowledge and reception of Apollinaire and in particular his status as an art critic and promoter of \[the\] avant\-garde’ **\[e\]**. 

 Read’s research was also central to another major European exhibition in 2016. His work on Apollinaire and welded\-iron sculptures played a key role in determining the design of the main public space of *Picasso. Sculptures*, an exhibition held at the Musée Picasso\-Paris between 10 September 2015 and 7 February 2016 and jointly organised with MoMA, New York. Featuring over 240 pieces, it was the largest collection of Picasso’s sculpted work assembled since 2000 **\[d\]**. According to the Directors of the Centre Pompidou and MNAM, Read’s participation in both exhibition and catalogue ‘went without saying’, owing to his status as one of the ‘major authorities’ on the relationship between Picasso and Apollinaire **\[e\]**. According to the President of the Musée Picasso\-Paris: ‘the publications of Read on the projects created by Picasso in memory of Guillaume Apollinaire defined the contours and the content of the central space’ **\[b\]**. The exhibition attracted 345,000 visitors and was described in the *Musée Picasso\-Paris 2016 Annual Report* as one of their most successful in terms of visitor numbers since the museum’s opening in 1985 **\[d\]**. Le Bon notes that, through his research and involvement in the exhibition, ‘Read contributed to a better knowledge of Picasso's sculpture, an area long ignored by critics.’ ‘There is no doubt’, Le Bon adds, ‘that the National Picasso Museum, like other cultural institutions, has benefited greatly from the work of Read’ **\[b\]**. 

 **Transforming public understanding of the relationship between artistic and literary modernism** 

 Through his engagement with professional and public audiences at galleries, major arts festivals, and literary events, Read’s research has also enriched the public and critical understanding of the interplay between literary and artistic modernism. He presented his research at the *Festival international du livre d’art et du film* \(Narbonne, 30 November 2017\) and at the *Rencontres d’été théâtre et lecture en Normandie* \(Deauville, July 2018\) **\[i\]**, and gave public talks at the Musée de l’Orangerie \(18 May 2016\) and the Musée Picasso\-Paris \(7 June 2016\). In these talks, he discussed the composite metal sculptures made by Picasso in the 1930s for the monument to Apollinaire with an audience of researchers, art historians, curators, and the general public. He then co\-organised a two\-day conference in Turin to mark the centenary of Apollinaire’s death \(October 2018\) **\[i\]**; this included an exhibition at the city’s modern art gallery and a musical play in one of its main theatres. During the major exhibition, *Picasso. Bleu et Rose* \(2018\), which was the first collaboration between the Musée d’Orsay and the Musée Picasso\-Paris, Read gave three lectures, including a public lecture, in front of full houses in the main Musée d’Orsay’s lecture theatre **\[b\]**. 

 The exhibition *Apollinaire: Le regard du poète* met with great critical success and the resultant news and media coverage further extended the impact of Read’s research to wide and diverse audiences. According to the *Musée d’Orsay’s 2016 Annual Report*, there were extensive features in *Libération* \(30 May 2016\) and *Le Monde* \(2 June 2016\); *Beaux Art*s magazine also devoted a special edition to the exhibition, while *France Culture*, one of the leading  [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France)  [public radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting) channels, dedicated a whole week to the poet, discussing the exhibition in various programmes **\[c\]**. Coinciding with this exhibition, Read was commissioned to edit the unpublished correspondence between Apollinaire and the art dealer Paul Guillaume **\[R3\]**. The Apollinaire exhibition, its catalogue, and the Apollinaire\-Guillaume correspondence were together given full\-page or double\-page coverage in leading national newspapers, including *Le Parisien* \(24 April 2016\) and *Le Journal des arts* \(24 May 2016\) **\[f\]**. 

 Furthermore, Read’s 2017 book *Apollinaire. Lettres, calligrammes, manuscrits* **\[R5\]**, co\-published and promoted by the BnF and heavily marketed for the centenary of Apollinaire’s death in Autumn 2018, also received widespread press coverage, including in *L’Orient, le Jour* \(21 November 2016\), *Le Figaro* \(15 December 2016\), *Florilettres* \(April 2016 and December 2016\), and *Pélerin* \(12 January 2017\), and was described as ‘fascinant’ \( *Le Monde*, 9 December 2016\) and ‘superbe’ \( *Télérama*, 3 December 2016\) **\[g, h\]**. *France Culture* devoted its daily slot on cultural events to the book \(13 December 2016\), describing it as ‘un véritable trésor’ **\[g\]**. Read presented the book as a guest on *Bibliothèque Médicis*, a literary talk show on French TV \(9 December 2016\); he featured for 50 minutes in the *France Culture* radio series ‘La Compagnie des auteurs’ \(14 April 2016\); and he gave a 20\-minute interview to the programme *Danse des mots,* recorded for Radio France Internationale and first broadcast on 4 January 2017 \(RFI has 40.5 million regular listeners every week, including 33.1 million in Africa and 4.3 million in South America\) **\[i\]**. 

 Read’s significant contributions to the catalogues that accompanied the critically acclaimed and popular exhibitions further enriched the critical and public understanding of the relationship between artistic and literary modernism. He was closely involved in the design and content of the catalogue for *Apollinaire: Le regard du poète*, and in addition authored ‘three remarkable essays \(including an unpublished manuscript by Matisse\)’ **\[a\]**. The catalogue had a substantial print run of 9,000 **\[c\]** and its high quality was recognised by the award of the 2016 Prix Catalpa, selected from a field of sixty publications for the best exhibition catalogue in Paris. Read also contributed to the catalogue of the *Picasso\-Giacometti* exhibition \(October 2016 \- February 2017 at the Musée Picasso\-Paris\) **\[b\]**, as well as to the catalogue \(published in German, English, and French\) of the major exhibition *Le Cubisme* **\[b\]**, shown first at the Centre Pompidou \(17 October 2018 \- 25 February 2019\) before moving to the Kunsthalle in Basel \(30 March \- 18 August 2019\). 

 Although Apollinaire has long been recognised as a founding figure of twentieth\-century literary modernism, his relationship with modern art and his status as an art critic has never been fully understood. Through Read’s contribution to curatorial practice and exhibition catalogues, as well as his media and press engagements, his ideas on modernist art have reached a large general audience across Europe and beyond **\[e\]**. As the President of the Musée Picasso\-Paris states: ‘his specific and extensive expertise has enabled Read to enrich the international appreciation of many aspects of literary and artistic modernism \[through\] his work with prestigious museums \[…\] and by publishing a series of innovative and influential texts’. **\[b\]**. Read’s work has been instrumental, in short, in reshaping the public understanding of the creative tension between art and literature.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Cambridge researchers developed the first automated network of ultra\-violet sensors to monitor volcanic gases at active volcanoes. Since the initial work on prototype instrumentation in 2002, the design has been implemented on 42 volcanoes across 18 countries and five continents. Sensors have been developed to be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles, which allows monitoring of highly active and difficult\-to\-access volcanoes. Worldwide, 500 million people live in areas at risk from volcanic eruptions. The impact of this research has been to: 

-  Protect life, property and livelihoods through: 

  -  enhancing the capability of volcano observatories worldwide to forecast eruptive activity in order to provide warning of imminent eruptions 

  -  providing critical input into government decisions leading to a\) evacuations and b\) mandatory exclusion zones 

-  Allow safe industrial re\-development \(e.g. geothermal on Montserrat\) 

-  Allow the people of Manam to stay on their own land, rather than being permanently displaced, through developing the ABOVE project community\-led resilience programme

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Up to the mid\-2000s, volcanoes were monitored largely using the occurrence of earthquakes and displacements of the ground surface, because these data were available at a high temporal resolution \(several measurements every second\) and were a reliable indicator of magma movement. Geochemical monitoring, which yields the only direct indication of magma close to the surface, was in its infancy, yet increases in gas fluxes from volcanoes often preceded eruptions and so provided a tantalising yet untapped source of information about eruptive activity. Gas flux data were available so infrequently \(once per day or per week, using cumbersome instrumentation\) that their utility was severely limited, despite their potential to track magma ascent and forecast eruption style. 

 Sulfur dioxide \(SO<sub>2</sub>\) fluxes are a critical part of volcano monitoring. When magma ascends towards the surface and decompresses, sulphur exsolves from silicate melt and enters the gas phase. This process is analogous to removing the cork from champagne, which results in CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles forming. The gas phase may migrate to the surface ahead of the magma, through permeable bubble networks. Increases in gas flux \(SO<sub>2</sub> is one of the primary gas species, the others are H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>\) therefore indicate the impending arrival of magma to the surface, i.e. they can be used, in tandem with seismicity and ground displacements, to forecast eruptions \[R1\]. 

 The impact described in this case was underpinned by research that took place within the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge between 2002\-2019, during which time a miniaturised UV spectrometer was developed for measurement of volcanic sulphur dioxide \[R2\] and the first network of scanning UV spectrometers was installed at volcanoes by **Edmonds, Oppenheimer** and co\-workers \[R3, 4\]. A network of three UV spectrometers was developed and installed in Montserrat during the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano in 2002 \[R2, 3\], whereby the spectrometers were connected to a scanning optical assembly and fibre optic cable, with power and telemetry, and code – which was made widely available \- was written to both acquire spectra and to retrieve SO<sub>2</sub> column amounts. SO<sub>2</sub> column amounts were combined with meteorological data to derive SO<sub>2</sub> fluxes every few minutes through the day, allowing the geochemical and geophysical data to be compared and interpreted on similar timescales, revolutionising the integrated monitoring of volcanoes \[R1, R5\]. 

 This development provided the model and basis for UV spectrometer networks elsewhere \[e.g. R3\]. In 2006, a modification of the instrument was awarded a US patent \(number 7,148,488: ""Apparatus for measuring radiation and method of use""\); **Oppenheimer** is a co\-holder of the patent and the instrument described has been distributed under the name of ‘FLYSPEC’. Scanning spectrometer networks were installed on 42 volcanoes \(for context, around 50\-60 volcanoes erupt every year\) across five continents between 2002 and 2020 \( **27 since 2013**, the period covered by this impact case\) by a number of research groups \(e.g. EU\-funded NOVAC, led by PI B. Galle, Chalmers University, co\-I **Oppenheimer**\) and volcano observatories *,* based on the design of the first installation in Montserrat, West Indies in 2002. 

 The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle \(UAV\) technology provided the opportunity for the ABOVE project, led by University of Cambridge researchers **Liu** and **Edmonds**, funded by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation, and including collaborators from the University of Bristol, USA, New Zealand, Germany, Sweden, Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica. The project developed cheap and portable sensors that could be mounted on UAVs to be flown into dangerous, highly active and difficult\-to\-access volcanoes \[R6\]. The data from these sensors showed previously unrecognised patterns in gas emissions related to bubble bursting, puffing and conduit dynamics \[R6\]. Subsequently, field campaigns to Guatemala, Montserrat and Papua New Guinea \(places with active volcanoes and particularly vulnerable populations\) in 2017\-2019 have established these UAV\-based methods, through training and sharing knowledge, as part of the regular toolkit of local volcano observatories for monitoring and hazard assessment. 

 Following the eruption of the White Island volcano in New Zealand in December 2019, and the tragic loss of life that followed, Edmonds was asked in August 2020 to provide consultant expert advice on gas monitoring data to the New Zealand Health and Safety Executive \(Worksafe\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Worldwide, 500 million people live in areas at risk from volcanic eruptions \[E1\]. The spectrometer networks first developed by Edmonds and colleagues at the University of Cambridge have been adopted by volcanological observatories on 42 volcanoes \(27 since 2013\) across 18 countries and five continents \[E2, E3\]. They are used to protect life, property and livelihoods through forecasting eruptive activity and informing critical decisions on evacuations and exclusion zones; to allow safe industrial re\-development; and – through the ABOVE project resilience programme \(Aerial\-Based Observations of Volcanic Emissions\) \- to allow the Manam islanders to remain on their island. 

 **Forecasting Eruptive Activity and providing warning of imminent eruptions** 

 The Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences \(GNS\), New Zealand, were among the first government bodies to develop a spectrometer system based on the design Edmonds and colleagues pioneered. Senior Scientist at GNS, Dr Craig Miller, states \[E4\]: 

 ‘*the UV scanning spectrometer network installed by Edmonds, Oppenheimer and colleagues in Montserrat provided the template for GNS volcanologists to develop a similar system at White Island, New Zealand. It is used for monitoring volcanic activity at this hazardous and unpredictable volcano. An increase in gas flux, along with increased levels of seismicity and ground deformation, would significantly increase the probability of eruption and consequently the alert level at the volcano, which is used for decision\-making surrounding issues such as restricting access and warnings to the public*’. 

 In October 2019, SO<sub>2</sub> fluxes measured by the scanning spectrometers \(and accompanying tremor\) at White Island increased to the highest levels since 2016, suggesting an eruption was imminent over the coming weeks and months \[E5, 6\]. On 18 November 2019, the alert level was raised to ‘2’ \(the highest before eruption\) signalling ‘heightened volcanic unrest’ and ‘potential for eruption hazards’ \[E7\]. 

 Tragically, an eruption on 9 December 2019 killed 19 people. In this case, clear warnings were not heeded, and preventative action which could have saved lives was not taken. 

 At Volcán Tungurahua \(Ecuador\), 30,000 people live in areas at risk from pyroclastic flows and lahars. A spectrometer system based on the Cambridge design was installed in 2004. Eruptions in 2013, 2014 and 2016 have had considerable impacts on livelihoods, particularly agricultural activities \(with crops damaged and land made unusable due to the deposition of volcanic ash\). The scanning spectrometer stations provide SO<sub>2</sub> flux data for the assessment of risk and early warning of eruptions. In February 2014 >600 people were evacuated after alert levels were raised in response to increasing SO<sub>2</sub> flux \(to over 2000 tonnes per day\), as well as increased rates of earthquakes and ash venting at the summit: 

 ‘*The automatic scanning DOAS stations as first developed at Soufriere Hills* 

 *Volcano, and which nice results have been shown by Edmonds and colleagues in 2003,* 

 *have been widely adopted by volcanological observatories over the past 15 years*… *At Tungurahua, we installed 2 DOAS systems directly based on the Montserrat UV* 

 *spectrometer system, the UV scanning spectrometer network yielded important data which,* 

 *when used in combination with other monitored parameters as seismic activity, allowed us* 

 *to assess hazard levels and advise local authorities on the general level of volcanic* 

 *activity’* \[E3, Instituto Geofisico, Ecuador\] *.* 

 **Providing critical input into mandatory exclusion zones** 

 In Montserrat, the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano ceased in 2011, yet it remains restless. One key characteristic is continued high flux of SO<sub>2</sub>, as measured by the spectrometer network, leading the government to retain an exclusion zone around the volcano. The Montserrat Volcano Observatory \(MVO\) and Scientific Advisory Committee \(British Foreign Office\) continue to rely on the SO<sub>2</sub> flux data to assess whether the eruption is over or has merely paused. The March 2019 MVO Scientific Report \[E8\] states: 

 ‘*the potential for continuing activity has been considered against the following three criteria:* 

1.  *Seismicity* 

1.  *Gas – daily SO<sub>2</sub> emission rates above 50 tonnes per day* 

1.  *Ground deformation* 

 *Criteria 2 and 3 are currently being met*.’ 

 Consequently, the volcano remains in an elevated state of unrest, with an exclusion zone including over half the island. 

 **Allowing safe industrial re\-development** 

 However, on Montserrat, the monitoring networks are now making economic recovery possible. The Government has permitted a geothermal plant to be established in the exclusion zone, a decision informed by advice from the MVO, based partly on gas flux information. The Director of the MVO \[E9\] states: 

 *‘In 2014 the Government of Montserrat gave permission for a geothermal company, the* Iceland Drilling Company *, to begin operations generating two boreholes from which it was projected that much of the island’s energy needs would be provided. A third well is planned for 2020. This permission was based on advice from the Montserrat Volcano Observatory on volcanic risk; gas fluxes were one part of the critical evidence upon which the low risk level for that particular area was assigned.’* 

 Test results indicate that geothermal power could generate more electricity than is needed by the island, freeing it from reliance on diesel\-powered generators – among the most expensive electricity in the world – and reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by replacing fossil fuel generated electricity \[E10\]. 

 **Allowing islanders to remain on their land** 

 The ABOVE project, led by University of Cambridge researchers Liu and Edmonds, involves field campaigns to Papua New Guinea volcanoes Rabaul and Manam to deploy UAV gas sensors and train local people in these techniques. Manam is a small island with > 2000 people, who are regularly evacuated to the mainland during eruptions every few years \(there have been nine since 2000\). Islanders live with extreme volcanic risk, as permanent relocation is unacceptable because the island is essential to their way of life and rehoming on the mainland brings risk of conflict. The UAV technology and training provided by the ABOVE project offers a means for them to remain. An ABOVE project video includes interviews with local people: 

 ‘*Those major eruptions \[in 2004\] were never addressed properly by the government… we have been waiting for 15 years and nothing is happening… We are regarded as IDPs – Internally Displaced Persons \- on our own land*.’\[E11\]. 

 The ABOVE project provides equipment and training to the local volcano observatory to continue measurements of gas fluxes using UAVs. One representative from each province in Papua New Guinea came to the training workshop in February 2019 and, thereafter, successfully lobbied provincial governments for additional funding \[E1\]. The islanders had relied on visual monitoring, but now fly UAVs over the volcano to monitor gas flux and activity to see what and who is most at risk, allowing them to remain on their own land.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Newcastle University research into formal modelling and design of asynchronous circuits and concurrent systems has laid the foundation to the development of industrial strength software “Workcraft”. Workcraft has been used by the microchip industry \(e.g., Dialog Semiconductor, Analog Devices\) to develop power\-management integrated circuits that are essential for saving electric energy and prolonging battery life in hundreds of millions of mobile devices around the world. 

 The design automation methodology that underpins Workcraft software improves productivity of electronic engineers from months to hours. Workcraft has also been used in training industry engineers and educating electronic engineering students. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Due to the widespread popularity of portable electronics such as mobile phones, there is an increasing demand for integrated circuits which are smaller, more complex, and yet cost\-effective. This has led to a rise in the use of Analogue and Mixed Signal \(AMS\) systems, in which both analogue and digital circuits co\-exist on a single chip. Increasingly, both analogue and digital parts are designed by the same team of engineers as it allows the overall AMS system to be holistically co\-optimized. AMS systems now play a vital role in monitoring a system's operating conditions, as well as distributing and regulating energy flows. However, AMS electronics is considered extremely hard to master, as the digital components must integrate seamlessly with the analogue parts, which are dynamic and notoriously hard to interface. 

 Newcastle University's longstanding research into the formal modelling of asynchronous and concurrent systems has inspired a new methodology for designing such systems, resulting in reduced inductor size and enhanced power conversion that responds to changes in demand more efficiently \[R1\-R4\].With energy becoming the most valuable resource in modern electronics, the responsiveness and robustness of power converters are crucial. Today’s chips make millions of control decisions every second, and a single mis\-step could cause malfunction or permanent damage. 

 The traditional approach to designing AMS control circuits relies on conventional synchronous components that require a clock frequency to be as high as 1 GHz, in order to meet the requirement of minimum latency of response, e.g. 1 nanosecond, to events generated by analogue components. This results in inefficient use of energy and a risk of failure. In contrast, using asynchronous logic for AMS control allows the system to operate at a pace that is determined by current operating conditions. AMS systems, however, need to keep evolving to track the advances in heterogeneous multi\-core systems architectures and of Internet of Things devices. 

 Newcastle University researchers tackled the issue of how to use asynchronous circuits as a control for analogue parts and as a front\-end for analogue\-to\-digital interfaces \[R1, R2\]. The methodology particularly draws on research into the use of Petri nets and causal representations of concurrent behaviour in electronic circuits \[R5\]. This has resulted in better power conversion efficiency, lower output ripple, faster response to analogue events, and reduced inductor size \[R3, R4\]. 

 Studies into the design of asynchronous VLSI circuits at Newcastle University date back to the 1990s, where Alex Yakovlev \(Lecturer/reader/professor of Computer Systems Design: 1991\- present\) developed the first formal model of the concurrent behaviour of such circuits Signal Transition Graphs \[R6\]. The research has since been carried out jointly with Maciej Koutny \(Lecturer/Reader/Professor\), Victor Khomenko \(Lecturer/EPSRC external research fellow/lecturer/senior lecturer/reader: 2003\-present\), Danil Sokolov \(Senior/Principal research associate\) and Andrey Mokhov \(Lecturer/Senior lecturer\) \[R1\]. 

 The resulting methodology has been implemented in several software tools \(such as Petrify, PUNF, MPSAT and PCOMP\), and in novel electronic components for interfacing analog and asynchronous parts \(WAIT, WAITX, SAMPLE\). It has also been integrated into a visual usable framework called Workcraft \[R1, R4\]. 

 Workcraft provides a flexible common framework for development of Interpreted Graph Models, including visual editing, \(co\-\)simulation, synthesis and formal verification. With Workcraft, the user can design a system using the most appropriate formalism \(or even different formalisms for the subsystems\), while still utilising the power of Petri net analysis techniques. The applications of the Workcraft framework are wide\-ranging: from modelling concurrent algorithms and biological systems to designing asynchronous electronic circuits and investigating crimes \(see workcraft.org\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Researchers from Newcastle University’s School of Engineering and School of Computing have developed new concepts, software and technologies that support the design and delivery of more reliable and efficient asynchronous systems. Their research has been incorporated into a visual toolset known as **Workcraft**. 

 Workcraft has been used by companies including electronic chip manufacturer Dialog Semiconductors, which paid for a bespoke version of the toolset to enhance the power conversion capabilities of its chips. Dialog’s principal client – Apple Corporation – invested US$600million in October 2018 to license some of Dialog’s power management technologies, acquire staff and assets, and support future research and development \[E3\]. 

 The Workcraft toolset is an open\-source project that is available publicly at workcraft.org. Additionally, after the initial stages of the R&D and impact creation in EPSRC project A4A \(2014\- 2017\), the project’s industrial partner Dialog Semiconductor supported R&D with their direct funding. Under this project besides open\-source software some novel bespoke functionality has been developed exclusively for Dialog Semiconductor. As a whole Workcraft was then used by the company to significantly enhance the power conversion capabilities of its chips. Dialog Semiconductor PLC is a multi\-national company which develops highly integrated mixed\-signal products for consumer electronics. It has approximately 1800 employees and offices in Europe, Asia and the USA \[E1\]. Its number one product is Power Management ICs. Its RapidCharge solutions for power adaptors boasted a 60% share of the rapid charge adapter market for smartphones at the end of 2017 \[E4\]. 

 The A4A project developed a novel design flow for the systematic development of asynchronous controllers for analogue\-mixed\-signal \(AMS\) systems, which has since been used in Dialog production chips \[E2\]. Newcastle University and Dialog co\-authored three papers in 2015 \[R2\], 2017 \[R1\] and 2019 \[R4\], demonstrating the advantages of asynchronous design methodology for AMS control. Simulation results indicated improved **reaction time, voltage ripple, peak current, and inductor losses, resulting in a higher efficiency of power conversion. These results meant that the size of coils could be reduced, a sizeable benefit for businesses such as mobile phone manufacturers, who see compact components and increased battery life and** **reliability as huge market drivers.** For example, it was reported at DATE 2017 \[R3, E2\] that for a 6μ load, an asynchronous control mentions peak current below 300mA using 1.8μH inductors. A synchronous control requires 10μH coils at 100MHz, 6.8μH at 333MHz, or 3.1μH at 666MHz \[E2\]. 

 Dialog extended its collaboration with Newcastle University following the end of the A4A project, providing an R&D project of over £500,000 to fund the further extension of Workcraft with new capabilities. Besides that, to date University has provided Workcraft tutorials to approximately 100 Dialog employees a year \(see: https://workcraft.org/training/start\). 

 In October 2018, Dialog announced that it had agreed a US$600million deal with Apple Corporation. The deal was the largest of its kind by Apple. Apple agreed to pay US$300million in cash to license certain power management technologies from Dialog, as well as to receive certain assets and over 300 employees to aid with chip research and development. The company also pre\-paid US$300million for Dialog products that would be delivered over the next three years. Dialog announced that it would continue to sell current and future generations of power management integrated circuits to Apple. Apple accounted for 75% of Dialog's total revenues this year, but the company expects that to drop to 35\-40% by 2022 \[E3\].In third quarter figures announced at the end of October 2018, Dialog announced record quarter revenue of US$384million, including a 3% year\-on\-year revenue rise in its Advanced Mixed Signal business. These results were collated before the Apple deal \[E4\]. In January 2019, it announced that its unaudited preliminary revenue for the full 2018 year was approximately US$1,442million \[E5\]. 

 Since 2017 a series of industrial track papers were produced in collaboration with Dialog Semiconductor for International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems \(ASYNC\). These papers are co\-authored with David Lloyd, who is a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Dialog Semiconductor. Being research papers, they have a strong practical focus on the design aspects that are especially relevant to industry \[E7, E8, E9\]. The latter for example, is aimed to help engineers to perform automatic verification of their asynchronous handshake circuits with a generic usage, going beyond power\-management circuits. 

 Notably, as a further illustration of the impact generated by Newcastle research, in December 2020, Danil Sokolov was hired as a full\-time employee by Dialog to continue integrating Workcraft into the company’s R&D process \(Sokolov is remaining a Visiting Fellow at Newcastle University\). 

 While Dialog is the main beneficiary of paid extensions to Workcraft functionality, a version of the toolset is available for free download. This makes advanced formal design techniques more accessible to industrial developers, rather than restricted to experts in the domain. Since 2014, there were 32 public releases of Workcraft that were downloaded 20K times from 4.7K unique IPs \(data sampled on 23.01.2021\). The availability of Workcraft attracts other companies and is increasingly featuring in the teachings of the future generation of engineers in this field. 

-  Other companies that have evaluated integration of Workcraft in their design flows, invested in training of engineers and, are able to use it in the design of products include: Analog Devices \(evaluated in 2018, last training in 2019\), Nordic Semiconductor \(since 2015, last training in 2019\) \[E10\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Kyriakidis, undertaken at the University of Kent, has been a key driver for the implementation of UN Sustainable Development Goals \(notably goals 4, 8, and 11\) to improve heritage management around the world. Kyriakidis’ research on community engagement for sustainable heritage management is a key pillar of the University’s <ins>CPD\-</ins><ins>accredited MA in Heritage Management</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>taught in collaboration with Athens Univer</ins><ins>sity</ins> <ins>of Economics and Business</ins> <ins>at the University’s Athens Centre</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Through</ins> <ins>his</ins> <ins>teaching</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>Kyriakidis’</ins> <ins>research findings</ins> <ins>ha</ins><ins>ve</ins> <ins>influenced professional practice and</ins> <ins>informed</ins> <ins>different heritage projects around the world</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>such as</ins> <ins>the Cultural Division of the Maya Train</ins> <ins>in Mexico</ins> <ins>and the</ins> <ins>new national strategy for the management of heritage in Ghana</ins><ins>. This</ins> <ins>has benefited</ins> <ins>heritage sites</ins><ins>, individuals</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>communities.</ins> 

 <ins>In addition,</ins> <ins>Kyriakidis’</ins> <ins>research forms the backbone</ins> <ins>o</ins><ins>f</ins> <ins>his</ins> <ins>n</ins><ins>on\-</ins><ins>g</ins><ins>overnmental</ins> <ins>o</ins><ins>rganisation</ins> <ins>\(NGO\)</ins> <ins>for h</ins><ins>erita</ins><ins>ge m</ins><ins>anagement</ins><ins>, the Heritage Management Organisation</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>or</ins> HERITΛGE \(formerly known as the Initiative for Heritage Conservation\). In this context, Kyriakidis has run additional workshops and summer schools, and maintained a <ins>HERITΛGE</ins> network. Through <ins>HERITΛGE, Kyriakidis</ins> <ins>enabled</ins> capacity\-building of partner and government organisations; for instance, through joint funding bids and consultancy. Kyriakidis’ work also addresses UN Sustainable Development Goal 13, on climate action. He influenced policy debate and brought cultural heritage preservation to the agenda of the Climate Action Summit in 2019.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2010, Kyriakidis has been undertaking fieldwork on his Peak Sanctuary Project, which has included ethnographic research at the village of Gonies \(Greece\). Through this project, Kyriakidis identified the need for a step change in how heritage was managed – from a focus on the conservation of the physical fabric of archaeological sites, to active site management that would increase efficiency, value, quality of care for heritage, and sustainability. A key finding was that there was an urgent need for consideration of the value of heritage \(i.e. what heritage stands for\), and ongoing values\-related management. The relevant research publications document his work at Gonies as an example of best practice in how to identify and meet challenges, and find a sustainable approach to heritage management **\[R1, R2\]**. His work argues that local communities should be primary stakeholders both in establishing the cultural value of heritage sites, and in the ongoing management of sites, and that this should be a meaningful process rather than a box\-ticking exercise. A key finding of the research was that empowering local communities to manage their own heritage was an effective and sustainable way of managing heritage sites. Furthermore, it found that awarding external grants \(resulting in large one\-off payments\) still leaves heritage sites at risk after the end of a grant\-funded period. 

 Kyriakidis’ research further identified the importance of intangible heritage \(such as knowledge, cultural practice, and traditions\) and the tendency for this type of heritage to be overlooked in assessments of heritage risk. Threats to intangible heritage include environmental factors such as climate change, which can accelerate the loss of intangible heritage knowledge. When environments change, relevant knowledge \(for instance in relation to pastoral farming\) can become obsolete, and thus is at risk of being lost **\[R1, R2, especially chapters 3\-4\]**.  From this research, Kyriakidis concluded that community engagement, value assessment, and heritage interpretation were key to developing a sustainable heritage management strategy for Greece. These conclusions were also identified as relevant for other countries with rich heritage assets. 

 Concurrently with the work at Gonies, Kyriakidis undertook a survey project, ‘Discovering the Archaeologists of Greece’ **\[R3\]**, as a case study on archaeological employment in a single country with rich heritage assets. The project set out to gather and quantify data on employment in archaeology, providing up\-to\-date information that can be used by heritage organisations to build capacity in the future. The survey was part of a larger European project that gathered this information in various countries. This research complements the research mentioned above, and has enabled Kyriakidis to address human resources management in his heritage training.

 <ins>Kyriakidis also</ins> <ins>advised</ins> <ins>the Greek</ins> <ins>G</ins><ins>overnment</ins> <ins>in</ins> <ins>develop</ins><ins>ing</ins> <ins>policy proposals</ins> <ins>that</ins> <ins>aimed to</ins> <ins>mitigate the impact of climate change on heritage. Kyriakidis’ proposals to the</ins> <ins>G</ins><ins>overnment, which he submitted in spring</ins><ins>/</ins><ins>summer 2019, were based</ins> <ins>on his</ins> <ins>research</ins> <ins>insight that the physical change</ins><ins>s</ins> <ins>to heritage sites</ins> <ins>caused by climate change</ins> <ins>can have a</ins> <ins>strongly</ins> <ins>negative impact on</ins> <ins>their local</ins> <ins>communities</ins> <ins> **\[</ins><ins>R</ins><ins>1</ins><ins>, R</ins><ins>2</ins><ins>\]**</ins><ins>. Importantly, his</ins> <ins>research</ins> <ins>had</ins> <ins>identified</ins> <ins>that the damage</ins> <ins>resulting from climate change</ins> <ins>can</ins> <ins>profoundly</ins> <ins>affect intangible heritage</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>in</ins> <ins>particular. In the policy proposals, h</ins><ins>e</ins> <ins>pointed out</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>diverse</ins> <ins>negative cultural and economic impacts that climate change has for communities. He argued that these would disrupt the lives of communities across the globe, limiting their ability to access and benefit from their cultural resources</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>and that traditional</ins> <ins>knowledge and</ins> <ins>practices would be lost</ins> <ins> **\[</ins><ins>j</ins><ins>\]**</ins><ins>. His</ins> <ins>proposals stated</ins> <ins>that it was</ins> <ins>a significant omission</ins> <ins>that cultural heritage is not</ins> <ins>systematically</ins> <ins>integrated in</ins><ins>to</ins> <ins>global climate change mitigation processes</ins> <ins>–</ins> <ins>including the</ins> <ins>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(</ins><ins>UNFCCC</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>and the Paris Agreement</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Kyriakidis</ins> <ins>argue</ins><ins>d</ins> <ins>that</ins> <ins>although t</ins><ins>he latter does</ins> <ins>mention</ins> <ins>'</ins><ins>traditional knowledge, knowledge of indigenous peoples and local knowledge systems</ins><ins>'</ins> <ins>\(Article</ins> <ins>7.5\)</ins><ins>, this</ins> <ins>does not go far enough</ins> <ins>in acknowledging</ins> <ins>the profound disruption to cultural heritage that can occur. T</ins><ins>his</ins> <ins>omission</ins> <ins>is</ins> <ins>a reflection of a persistent institutional gap between the cultural heritage and climate change communities, which must be</ins> <ins>urgently</ins> <ins>addressed</ins> <ins> **\[</ins><ins>j</ins><ins>\]**</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Kyriakidis wrote the initial proposal</ins> <ins> **\[j\]**</ins> <ins>and approved the final text for the Athens</ins> <ins>S</ins><ins>ummit. The proposals led to a</ins> <ins>conferen</ins><ins>c</ins><ins>e</ins> <ins>\(21\-22 June 2019\) ‘and formed the basis for the final text</ins> <ins>signed and sent to Abu Dhabi \[in June 2019\], where</ins> <ins>HERIT</ins><ins>ΛGE</ins> <ins>represented Greece’</ins> <ins> **\[</ins><ins>k</ins><ins>\]**</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins> **‘**</ins>Following the recommendations of Dr Kyriakidis and HERIT<ins>Λ</ins>GE, the Greek government organised a parallel session to the UN summit in New York that paved the way for heritage to be included in the main discussion in that summit and then to be included in to the minutes of COP25.’ **\[k, l\]** This success at the 2019 Climate Action Summit means that heritage organisations are now able to lobby their governments for funding in the context of climate change.
