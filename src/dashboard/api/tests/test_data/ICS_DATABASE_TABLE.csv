###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Women in African prisons represent a small \(3.4%\) but extremely vulnerable population with complex and specific health needs that are often not adequately addressed. Our research \(since 2017\) has highlighted appalling environmental conditions with neglect of gender sensitive prison health care. To date, our research has informed the 2017 and 2019 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \(UNODC\) regional prison audits; the lead authoring of the 2019 UNODC/WHO Technical guidance on Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV in prisons \(S3\); and participation in global expert consultation on HIV in prisons for the upcoming UNAIDS strategy 2021\-2026. It has resulted in an increased Malawi Prison Service health budgetary allocation of K30 million \(£27,832\) to specifically cater for the menstrual hygiene materials for females and girls in prisons in the 2019/2020 national budget. Overall, it underpins continued lobbying for penal/judicial reform. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Africa remains at the epicentre of the HIV epidemic with two thirds of all people infected with HIV living in this region \(estimated to be 23.8 million\), with women disproportionately affected. There is a concentration of HIV/AIDS amongst those who are incarcerated up to fifteen times higher than in the community. 

 In 2017 **Van Hout** commenced this research as Lead Evaluator for UNODC technical responses to HIV in southern African prisons with colleagues from the University of Zimbabwe. This UN evaluation \(R1\) highlighted that public health challenges centre on ensuring the sexual and reproductive health \(SRH\) rights of women prisoners are respected as they constitute a vulnerable HIV/AIDS risk population, and experience dual disadvantage according to gender and incarceration. This evaluation reported that women’s special sexual and reproductive health needs are neglected in prisons through a lack of equivalent healthcare access and care. 

 In 2017 **Van Hout**, in collaboration with the University of Zimbabwe and the University of Malawi, received funding from the AHRC/MRC for a project entitled ‘Promoting positive sexual and reproductive health and accessible HIV Prevention, Treatment, Care and Support \(PTC&S\) services for women prisoners in Zimbabwe and Malawi’ \(2018\-2020\). This project incorporated a strong focus on prevention of mother\-to\-child transmission \(PMTCT\) of HIV in prisons, which at the time required guidance and roll out. 

 Although there are over one million people in African prisons, research activity on prison health is historically of low priority. We highlight this in review/regional audit papers \(R2, R3\), two in\-depth qualitative studies in prisons located in Zimbabwe and Malawi \(R4, R5\), and a recent Lancet Global Health  article \(R6\), all of which underscore the significant challenges in conducting ethical health research in sub\-Saharan Africa \(SSA\) prisons. Difficulties include: securing access to prisons; the lack of robust health surveillance across prison services; and the complexities given the low governmental resource allocation to ensuring prisoners’ right to health. Reform is painstakingly slow and small changes \(i.e. an increase in resources allocated\) represent a huge step forward in this context. 

 This research has highlighted the dearth of **gender specific strategic information** on women prisoners in Africa \(R1\-3\), appalling environmental conditions **conducive to spread of disease** \(R1, R2\), inadequate prison health care provision \(R1, R2, R4, R5\), and **violation of human rights** for those incarcerated \(R1\-5\). Enhanced donor support, resource allocation, prison health and population health policy reform, **prison health research and health systems surveillance**, and **gender sensitive prison health** service provision was, and are still warranted \(R1\-6\). 

 This body of research, the UK\-African collaboration and its objectives sit within the current UNAIDS strategy with the global aim: Fast Track Approach to end AIDS \(UNAIDS 2016\-2021\) through working and collaborating in an interdisciplinary and multi\-sectoral partnership \(SDG 17\), to challenge sexual and reproductive health problems encountered by women and their children when incarcerated. This research is vital in terms of addressing the spread of HIV across communities through surveillance, research activity, and engaging in policy dialogue by involving all stakeholders \(prisoners, prison and health staff, higher level officials, academics, community and international organisations\). It is an imperative that the gains made, however small, in tackling HIV in prisons are not lost due to the severe impact of COVID\-19 on Africa prison systems, and government capacity to resource the health of prisoners and prison staff.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The 2017 UNODC evaluation of technical responses to HIV in prisons in Angola, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania \(\+Zanzibar\), Zambia & Zimbabwe \(R1\) initiated change in the SSA region by highlighting the dearth of gender specific strategic information on women prisoners in the region; appalling environmental conditions and prison health care provision; and violation of human rights for those incarcerated. It further established the foundation for the development of guidance specifically in relation to the prevention of mother\-to\-child transmission of HIV in Prisons. In 2018, **Van Hout**, as a leading prison health and gender expert, was the invited lead author of the Global Technical guidance on PMTCT in prisons \(2019\) \[S1\]. 

 In 2018, three audit reviews of health standards in prisons in the region were undertaken, one on women, one on children and a third on juveniles incarcerated in SSA \(R2, R3\). These audits were published as scoping review papers to map extant literature and, along with two in\-depth multi\-stakeholder prison investigations in Malawi and Zimbabwe, highlight the grave situation of women; mothers; children incarcerated with their mothers; and juveniles in prisons. Conditions are exacerbated by the lack of basic necessities, inadequate hygiene, sanitation and safe drinking water, exposure to diseases in overcrowded cells, inadequate nutrition, lack of provision of clothing and bedding, and difficulties accessing paediatric care. 

 These findings were further supported by an additional scoping review on ethical standards of prison research and Lancet Global Health commentary \(R6\) underscoring the need to prioritise ethical prison health research in the SSA region. All were used by UNODC in 2019 and 2020 to assess health standards and leverage for penal and prison health reform in the region \[S2, S3\], and are cited in the Global Prison Trends 2020 report \(page 51\). Reported paediatric morbidity and mortality associated with evident prison conditions is a deeply concerning issue and contrary to international mandates for the rights of the child, right to health and non\-discriminatory standards of care. For women and juveniles, sexual abuse and the violation of international human rights norms is observed in the systemic abuse and detention of young people with adults. Basic needs are still not met in relation to sanitation, ventilation, safe spaces, protection from physical and sexual violence, clothing, food and access to HIV and medical care. 

 In 2019, as part of the MRC\-funded grant, sensitisation, performance, and theatre workshops were conducted by the Zimbabwe and Malawi teams in two female prisons \(Chikurubi, Chikiri\) where over 75 prisoners were reached, for the first time ever, using a transformative approach. This culminated in a national roll out of transformative theatre as a medium to empower prisoners and prison staff together in national prison systems in each country. Using such an approach can advance health standards, health rights and actualize sexual health rights based approaches in prisons in both countries, and Africa using a transformative sustainable development approach. 

 Prior to 2019, prisons were reliant on NGOs and faith\-based organisations to provide menstrual hygiene materials for females and girls in prisons. However, a TV show in Zimbabwe \(MAI CHISAMBA SHOW\) and the BMC paper \(R2\)  were considered as evidence at Parliament and resulted in an increase in the Malawi Prison Service health budgetary allocation \(by K30 million \(£27,832\)\) to specifically cater for these materials in the 2019/2020 national budget \[S4, S5\]. 

 The Global Technical guidance was launched by the UNODC in May 2019 at the UNODC HIV/AIDS Section at the 28th Session on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice \(CCPCJ\) \[S6\]. It provides a framework of standard operational procedures, to ensure that African prisons provide adequate HIV testing, care and support for incarcerated women and their children. The WHO has quoted; “These tailored procedures give women in prison a better chance at staying healthy and giving birth to healthy babies, and ultimately contribute to healthier communities”. 

 Following its launch, dissemination of this guidance in Africa commenced in 2019. Since then, and up to 31 December 2020, this technical guidance has been operationalised in 10 countries via the training of over 60 delegates: Angola, eSwatini, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique, Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe \[S2\]. In 2020, **Van Hout** was invited to become an ambassador to support a 2021 evaluation to determine the extent of prison healthcare reform and practice improvement; and detailed rates of HIV care. This will give some indication of impact in terms of country\-level improvement of prison health services and the adoption of standard operating procedures based on the technical guidance for women and children. In 2021, this guidance will be adapted to the Central Europe and East Asian region who are experiencing an HIV epidemic, and who require PMTCT in prisons. 

 In 2020 **Van Hout** advised the regional Middle East and North Africa \(MENA\) UNODC Committee in their evaluation of HIV prevention, treatment and care in Egyptian, Moroccan and Tunisian prisons \[S7\]. Prison systems in the MENA region generally do not have sufficient robust data on HIV and HCV prevalence, with the links between prison health and public health relating to prisons and these epidemics remaining poorly understood. Tackling the issue in this part of Africa is further compounded by restrictive laws, rejection of harm reduction strategies at the policy level and lack of political commitment; in addition to the scarcity of existing services. **Van Hout** has just completed the 2020 regional assessment of drug use and harm reduction in Middle Eastern and North African prisons. Collectively this work is gathering momentum across North to Southern Africa and through UNODC and MENAHRA advocacy and sensitisation work and HIV technical assistance with governments it will help address prisoners’ conditions and their specific health needs in prisons, and ultimately bridge the gap between prison and population health in Africa \[S8\]. 

 This is vitally important given the high turnover of inmates and HIV prevalence in the SSA and MENA communities and prisons, and the lack of quantifiable data on HIV rates across prisons as this is not part of routine enquiry. It is also crucial given the threats to health caused by the COVID\-19 pandemic in these countries. To this end, during 2020 **Van Hout** published six human rights papers on the imperatives of upholding occupational health rights of prison staff, and alternatives to sentencing for women, and advocated for the early release of women and children to be included in government strategies to tackle \[COVID\-19\] contagion in African prisons, where prisoners and staff are severely vulnerable. 

 Overall, as a direct result of this body of research, UNDOC has committed to undertaking a programme of further work: 

-  Conceptual impact in raising higher level, professional level, prisoner and community level HIV awareness and contribution to knowledge. 

-  Instrumental impact in stimulating policy and practice reform around the SRH rights of women in prison based on the evidence synthesis and policy dialogue in each country. 

-  Capacity building impact in building strategic research capacity to strengthen research uptake and evidence based strategic monitoring in SSA prisons. 

-  Networks and connectivity impact in establishing a new cross cutting and interdisciplinary partnership between LJMU, international organisations \(UNODC, UNAIDS, WHO, MENAHRA\), leading NGOs \(CHREAA\) and universities in Zimbabwe and Malawi which connects the supply evidence of HIV \(and now COVID\-19\) in prisons with demand for change, particularly for women and other minorities in the region.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Major new data on peace and transition processes produced by the Political Settlements Research Programme identified the need for inclusion of more diverse constituencies at all stages of the process. Extensive comparative analysis demonstrated how to navigate political tensions between strategies aimed at inclusion of the armed actors responsible for conflict and strategies aimed at wider inclusion. It provided an evidence\-base that was critical to interrelated impacts on: \(i\) new international laws on inclusion; \(ii\) new practices supporting the inclusion of women in UN peace mediation; and \(iii\) new global policies on the development\-peace nexus.

 2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2015, the Political Settlements Research Programme \(PSRP\) directed by Bell \(GBP6,570,000; FCDO\) has addressed a fundamental dilemma in peace negotiations: to end conflict, political\-military elites need to agree to share power; but broader forms of social inclusion and agendas for change are also necessary to sustain these pacts over time. 

 A key output is the PA\-X Peace Agreements Database \(3.1\): the first large\-scale qualitative and quantitative dataset enabling comparison of how inclusion is addressed in peace and transition processes. PA\-X data is extensive, including more than 1800 agreements in the more than 150 peace processes concluded between 1990 and 2020, with full subject\-matter coding and sub\-databases on gender and local agreements. It is accessible in end\-user tested search interfaces, visualisations, interactive infographics, and statistical and corpus \(text\-based\) formats. 

 PSRP data enables comparison of both agreements and processes, including interrogation of who is included at what point in a peace process and their effect on the agreement’s agenda for change and its implementation. Through unique cross\-site partnerships with conflict\-affected communities, peacebuilders and international organisations, PSRP research has demonstrated the long\-term timeframes and multiple agreements that constitute peace processes in a practice field that was narrowly focused on inclusion at the ‘handshake moment’ of a comprehensive agreement. Analysis focuses on how inclusion efforts are shaped through bargaining dynamics by political\-military elites representing the conflict parties, and how wider social inclusion should be supported in ways that engage with this reality. It points to how peace processes unfold in iterative, incremental stages, with non\-linear moves from conflict to peace \(3.1\). 

 Pre\-negotiation, partial, comprehensive and implementation agreements create different opportunities and risks for inclusion at different stages \(3.2\). To provide effective support, international actors need to understand the entire trajectory of a peace process and the different political obstacles to inclusion at each stage, and how to overcome them. Most particularly, inclusion is central to conflict resolution and specific findings include: 

-  Inclusion agendas are set at early stages of talks when only political\-military actors are present, creating pathway dependencies that constrain broader peace negotiations \(3.4\). Implementation agreements also ‘re\-narrow’ negotiations and renegotiate past commitments, including those to include women and non\-dominant minorities. Participation strategies need to focus more on early and late stages of peace processes \(3.3, 3.4, 3.5\). 

-  International norms leverage change when they support civil society actors to engage effectively with political bargaining more than simply ‘mandating’ change \(3.6\). 

-  UN Security Council Resolution 1325’s requirements that a ‘gender perspective’ be adopted in peace agreements remains under\-implemented \(3.4, 3.5\). After 15 years, references to women in peace agreements increased from 11% to 27%, but few agreements embrace a holistic equality agenda. Women require multiple modalities of inclusion to gain entry to mediation processes at international, national and local levels. 

-  Peace processes, especially complex power\-sharing arrangements, often create ‘formalised unsettlement’ rather than settlement, with unstable bargains which stall \(3.2\-3.6\). Civil society can find unusual opportunity structures for widening and deepening these bargains if supported to adopt an incremental approach.

 4. Details of the impact 

 \(i\) New international laws on inclusive peace processes 

 As part of the UN’s 15\-year review of UN Security Council Resolution \(UNSCR\) 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, Bell provided input through commissioned papers and workshops. PSRP research was extensively cited in the UN review \(5.1\), informed recommendations in the 2015 UN Secretary General’s \(UNSG\) Report to the Security Council \(5.2\) and influenced UNSCR 2242 \(5.3\). The Senior Gender Adviser to the UNSG affirmed that PSRP research was *“critical to informing policy thinking, norms, and programming practice to achieve the overall goals of the United Nations in this area”* \(5.4\); tracing its impact on UNSCR 2242 to *“Article 1 which requires better inclusion of women in peace processes and better technical advice to both women and mediators to increase the effectiveness of talks”,* and to paragraph 7, which *“recommends inclusion of women at **all stages of a process**”* \(5.4\). Further data and analysis informed follow\-up reviews resulting in more specific commitments; for example, the 2018 UNSG Report \(5.5.a\) and subsequent UNSCR 2493 \(5.5.b\) promoting: “ *the direct representation of women in negotiations and striving for gender\-balanced mediation teams with members who are well versed in obligations related to gender equality and women, peace and security”* \(5.4, referring to 5.5.a, 5.5.b\). 

 PSRP work supported the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development \(OECD\), comprising the 37 main aid\-donor states, to better integrate overseas development support with conflict resolution strategies. Specifically, it contributed to the implementation of the OECD Development Assistance Committee’s \(DAC\) ‘Recommendation on the Humanitarian\-Development\-Peace Nexus’ – a new legal instrument that provides *“a comprehensive framework that can incentivise and implement more collaborative and complementary humanitarian, development and peace actions, particularly in fragile and conflict\-affected situations”* \(5.6.a\). The former head of the International Network on Conflict and Fragility \(INCAF\) Secretariat at the OECD stated: *“The contribution of PSRP’s research findings and discussion amongst INCAF members were an important aspect in helping to shape this instrument – including the incorporation of key elements around \(1\) the utilisation of political engagement and other tools, instruments and approaches at all levels to prevent crises, resolve conflicts and build peace \(Clause III, 3 a\-c\); \(2\) the prioritisation of prevention, mediation and peacebuilding, investing in development whenever possible \(Clause IV, 1 a\-f\); \(3\) putting ‘people at the centre’ and providing opportunities for conflict affected groups to engage in peace processes \(Clause IV, 2 a\-b\)”* \(5.6.b\). 

 \(ii\) Supporting women to navigate inclusion 

 PSRP worked as a core partner with UN Women on programming to enhance women’s leadership in Middle East peace processes \(5.1\). It developed novel training materials in Arabic and English and provided tailored technical support for advisory bodies established by UN mediators \(5.7.a, 5.7.b\). As an Advisor for Women, Peace and Security for UN Women confirmed: *“the collaboration resulted in commitments from the mediation teams on Yemen and Syria to ensure women’s inclusion in processes that would otherwise almost exclusively involve men. PSRP can therefore claim credit not only for this significant change in the polic\[ie\]s of mediation teams regarding women’s inclusion, but also for providing women peace makers with the tools and strategies needed to influence peace for more justice societies”* \(5.7.b\). PSRP also co\-designed a PeaceFem app, providing easy\-access advice on gender strategies and drafting on inclusion in English and Arabic \(over 900 downloads\) \(5.7.c\). 

 \(iii\) Re\-shaping global policy on the development\-peace nexus 

 PSRP research \(3.2, 3.3\) provided *“a vital part of the evidence base”* for the flagship UN/World Bank study, ‘Pathways for Peace’ \(5.8\), and is specifically cited on the need for political strategies to manage the relationship between inclusion and political contestation \(5.9\). The former Senior Advisor to the UNSG Peacebuilding Support Office \(report co\-author\) stated: *“Since its launch in 2018, Pathways for Peace has been downloaded over 100,000 times, from over 100 countries…\[and\] has been used as source material in the development of the World Bank Group’s first ever Fragility, Conflict and Violence Strategy, the US government task force report on Preventing Extremism in Fragile States and the first ever OECD legal recommendations to DAC members”* \(5.8\). 

 PSRP research was also central to the ‘UK Approach to Stabilisation: A Guide for Policy Makers and Practitioners’ \(5.10.a\). As the Conflict and Stabilisation Advisor for the Stabilisation Unit explained, there has been notable success in: *“the use of the guide to inform Libya…and Yemen strategy development and stabilisation programming in…Mali and Yemen…and in influencing international partners’ approach to stabilisation, including at the UN and within the Stabilisation Leaders Forum”* \(5.10.b\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Malaria in pregnancy is a leading cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Research led by LSTM contributed directly to improved World Health Organisation \(WHO\) and endemic country policies and practices for the treatment and prevention of malaria in pregnancy in different transmission and drug resistance strata in sub\-Saharan Africa and Asia\-Pacific. Specifically, ministries of health in 36 African nations are now implementing a more effective malaria prevention strategy improving the outcome of approximately 32,000,000 pregnancies at risk annually and thereby the lives of mothers and their infants. Furthermore, following our studies on the safety of artemisinin\-based combination therapy, regulatory authorities and WHO pre\-qualification have updated drug labels for use in pregnancy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Between 2007 and 2017, ter Kuile \(Head\) and Hill \(Project Manager\) led the MiP \(Malaria in Pregnancy\) Consortium, a global network of 40 research institutions, that aimed to evaluate new strategies for the control of malaria in pregnancy to inform policy and improve the lives of mothers and their infants. 

 WHO recommends intermittent preventive treatment \(IPTp\) with sulphadoxine\-pyrimethamine \(SP\) for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in Africa. IPTp comprises a treatment dose of an antimalarial given presumptively at each scheduled antenatal care \(ANC\) visit, alongside case management and use of insecticide\-treated nets in malaria\-endemic countries. These strategies have come under threat due to increasing drug resistance and suboptimal coverage of these interventions. 

 **Treatment \(global\)** 

 Since 2006, WHO has recommended 3\-day regimens with artemisinin\-based combination therapies \(ACTs\) as first\-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimesters of pregnancy. Due to lack of safety data, ACTs are not recommended for 1<sup>st</sup> trimester treatment unless no other suitable antimalarials are available. Treatment recommended in the first trimester involves 7\-day quinine regimens, which are badly tolerated and associated with poor adherence and therefore high rates of treatment failure. In a systematic review of health provider practices and access to case management of malaria during pregnancy \(2014\), Hill found widespread substandard practices for the case\-management of pregnant women with the continued use of obsolete antimalarials in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester that are no longer recommended by WHO and use of ACTs in the 1<sup>st</sup> trimester \[1\]. This led Dellicour and ter Kuile to undertake the largest individual participant data meta\-analysis on the safety of artemisinin antimalarials in the 1<sup>st</sup> trimester involving 717 well\-documented artemisinin and 947 quinine exposures from Asia and Africa. This showed that, contrary to data from animal models, artemisinin exposure in early pregnancy does not increase the risk of pregnancy loss or congenital anomalies compared to quinine and can be more effective at reducing pregnancy loss \[2\] as low adherence to the 7\-day quinine regime results in a 4\-fold higher risk of treatment failure. 

 **Prevention \(Africa\)** 

 Until 2012, IPTp with SP comprised at least two doses given in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester. ter Kuile’s 2013 meta\-analysis of IPTp trials showed that three or more doses of SP was well tolerated and safe and far more effective than the 2\-dose regimen resulting in 49% \(95% CI 32\-62\) and 20% \(6\-31\) greater reductions in placental malaria and low birth weight, respectively \[3\]. However, the IPTp strategy is under threat due to increasing resistance to SP. ter Kuile and US Center for Disease Control colleagues showed that the efficacy of SP to clear existing malaria infections or prevent new ones is severely compromised in areas with high SP resistance. In a 2019 meta\-analysis involving approximately 100,000 births, van Eijk and ter Kuile showed that alternative strategies are urgently needed in areas where over 37% of parasites carry the highly resistant sextuple\-mutant Pfdhps\-A581G\-containing genotype \[4\]. 

 In two trials of potential alternatives to IPTp\-SP coordinated by ter Kuile \(between 2011 and 2016\), intermittent screening and treatment strategies \(where only women testing positive for malaria are treated\) was found not to be a suitable alternative at current levels of rapid diagnostic test \(RDT\) sensitivity \[5,6\]. By contrast, IPTp with the antimalarial dihydroartemisinin\-piperaquine resulted in a decrease of 68% \(44\-82\) in malaria infections during pregnancy, and a 59% \(1\-83\) reduction in spontaneous miscarriage or stillbirth compared to IPTp\-SP. This was the first of eight IPTp trials with dihydroartemisinin\-piperaquine which is now considered the most promising alternative to replace SP for IPTp in high SP resistance areas \[5\]. By November 2020, three trials had been completed \(the first of which was led by LSTM\), and a further 5 are ongoing \(the largest of which is led by LSTM\). Results are expected in Q4 2021. 

 **Prevention \(Asia\)** 

 In the first trial of its kind in Asia, Ahmed and ter Kuile showed that malaria infection decreased by 41% \(17\-58\) with monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin\-piperaquine and is a promising alternative to the current policy of screening pregnant women for malaria at their first antenatal care visit in areas of moderate\-to\-high transmission in the Asia\-Pacific region \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Prof ter Kuile and Dr Hill applied a systematic approach to ensure the translation of research into policy by working with WHO to convene four consecutive Evidence Review Group meetings on malaria in pregnancy \(between 2012 and 2017\), which reviewed results from research led by LSTM and other partners and made recommendations both to WHO’s Malaria Policy Advisory Committee \(MPAC\) \[1\] and regulators \(see below\). Dissemination and technical support activities targeting policymakers and practitioners were undertaken to support policy uptake in endemic countries, improving pregnancy outcomes of millions of women in malaria\-endemic countries. 

 **Update to drug labels of ACTs for treatment of malaria in pregnancy** 

 The safety studies in 1<sup>st</sup> trimester pregnancy described above resulted in label changes by the United States Food and Drug Administration \(FDA, August 2019\), the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures at the European Medicines Agency \(September 2020\), and the WHO pre\-qualification team \(March 2018\) for the use of the ACT artemisinin\-lumefantrine in pregnancy \[2\-4\]. The label change requested by the FDA was to lift the restriction on the use of Coartem® in pregnancy, including in the 1<sup>st</sup> trimester, based on the results of the 2017 meta\-analysis. These label changes affect the use of these drugs in pregnancy by clinical practitioners and enable national malaria programmes to improve the quality of case management in the 1<sup>st</sup> trimester by shifting to the more effective 3\-day ACT regimens from the current 7\-day quinine regimen, which is poorly tolerated and badly adhered to, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. 

 The results were also reviewed by WHO’s MPAC in 2015 \(6\) which recommended a change from quinine to artemisinin combination therapies \(ACTs\) as a first\-line therapeutic option for uncomplicated malaria in the 1<sup>st</sup> trimester, which was subsequently endorsed by WHO’s Technical Expert Group on Malaria Chemotherapy in December 2017 \[1\]. As a result of the label changes by the Stringent Regulatory Authorities \(SRAs\), WHO is proceeding and has requested our group to update the meta\-analysis with any new data in preparation for the development of an update to the WHO treatment guidelines in 2021. Independent of WHO, Indonesia was the first country \(September 2019\) to change its national policy for treatment of malaria in 1<sup>st</sup> trimester to the ACT, dihydroartemisinin\-piperaquine \[7\], which was already the first line therapy for treatment in all population groups, including in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester. 

 **WHO’s updated policy on prevention of malaria in pregnancy in sub\-Saharan Africa** 

 *IPTp with SP:* Increasing resistance to SP in parts of Africa led malaria\-endemic countries to place pressure on WHO to provide further guidance on whether to continue using IPTp with SP. The LSTM\-led studies on the continued effectiveness of IPTp\-SP on reducing low birth weight, even in areas with relatively high SP resistance \(likely due to the non\-malarial effects of SP\), led WHO in September 2013 to recommend continued implementation of IPTp\-SP in all endemic areas until alternative drugs become available \[5\]. 

 *IPTp with DP:* Our research showing the efficacy of dihydroartemisinin\-piperaquine, for use in areas with very high SP resistance, and related studies of its acceptability and feasibility presented to WHO’s MPAC in 2015 \[6\], led WHO to recommend further studies with IPTp\-DP to provide definitive evidence for consideration of IPTp\-DP for policy in 2021 \[8\]. 

 **Implementation of revised guidelines on prevention of malaria in pregnancy in Africa** 

 Results from our key meta\-analysis comparing 3\-or\-more doses vs the standard 2\-dose regimen of IPTp with SP led WHO to revise its guidelines in 2012, and updated in 2014, from 2 doses to monthly doses of SP \[9\]. The IMPPACT project \(between 2016 and 2019\), led by Hill, supported the uptake of evidence from the MiP Consortium in African country\-level policies and guidelines. In collaboration with the Roll Back Malaria \(RBM\) Partnership, and the West Africa Health Organisation \(WAHO\), the MiP Consortium results were disseminated to 21 African countries \[10a\]. The WAHO meeting in 2017 involving National Malaria Control Programme Managers, M&E Officers, and Reproductive Health Managers from the 15 Economic Community of West African States \(ECOWAS\) member States, WHO, UNICEF, RBM, research organisations and the private sector, took place in the context of the preparation of country Global Fund applications between 2018 and 2020 \[10b\]. Countries reached a regional consensus on the implementation of malaria control activities, including the monthly IPTp\-SP policy, articulated in the ECOWAS Regional Strategic Plan for Malaria Control and Elimination. WHO’s 2019 World Malaria Report reported that the updated policy had been adopted in 36 endemic countries in Africa \[11\]. As a result, annually, 32,000,000 pregnancies in Africa continue to benefit from this life\-saving strategy for pregnant women annually. 

 **National prevention policy uptake in Asia\-Pacific** 

 Results from the prevention trial with dihydroartemisinin\-piperaquine \(DP\) and nested acceptability, feasibility and cost effectiveness studies in Indonesia were discussed with more than 110 ministries of health representatives from 18 countries in the Asia/Pacific region at a dissemination meeting in collaboration with WHO\-WPRO and WHO\-SEARO regional offices in 2017 \[10c\]. In 2019, as a direct result of these studies, the Indonesian Ministry of Health requested support from Hill and ter Kuile to evaluate the pilot implementation of IPTp\-DP in Papua\-Indonesia, and an LSTM\-led study funded by the Medical Research Council \(MRC\) is ongoing.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research initiated and led by Graham has developed five principles for fair work organised by digital labour platforms. These cover pay, conditions, contracts, management and worker representation. To date, platforms offering many different services in 23 countries worldwide have been rated on a 10\-point scale that evaluates their performance across all five principles. The research has directly improved the conditions of employment that popular platforms offer to workers in South Africa and helped to tighten the health and safety legislation for gig workers during the COVID\-19 pandemic in the UK. The principles have also been embedded in policy in Germany at both state and federal government levels.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Digital labour platforms represent a rapidly growing new economic model that provides income for at least 84,000,000 workers worldwide, in sectors such as taxi ride\-hailing, domestic/cleaning work, delivery and logistics, and freelancing. This platform\-organised ‘gig work’ often falls outside the purview of traditional employment protections, and many workers experience precarity, low pay, and unsafe working conditions \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. Graham has analysed the geography of digital labour markets around the planet. **R1** draws on a multi\-year study with digital workers in Sub\-Saharan Africa and South East Asia and reveals four shared concerns: bargaining power, economic inclusion, intermediated value chains, and ‘upgrading’ of work. **R2** extends that analysis by highlighting the high degree of algorithmic control that digital labour platforms exert over workers, and how this can result in low pay, unsocial hours, offloading risk on to workers, and denial of due process. Graham and colleagues have proposed multiple strategies to improve working conditions in the gig economy, including regulation, organising workers, democratising platforms, and introducing certification schemes. 

 The idea of a certification scheme for decent work on digital labour platforms was elaborated further in **R3**. This led to the creation of the ‘Fairwork Foundation' – a participatory action\-research project that evaluates the work conditions of digital labour platforms across the globe, scoring individual platforms on how well, or how poorly, they perform. From inception, the Foundation’s research activities have been undertaken in close collaboration with platforms, workers, trade unions, regulators, labour lawyers, and academics. This has resulted in the formulation of five “principles for fair work” \(published in **R4**\): 

-  *Fair pay*: fair levels of pay and pay terms \(including meeting of workers’ costs\); 

-  *Fair conditions*: fair ways to carry out the work, including mitigating risks and actively improving health and safety; 

-  *Fair contracts*: transparent, concise and accessible contractual documents that attribute employment status to the worker; 

-  *Fair management*: fair operation of the platform with respect to the work process \(including disciplinary practices\), communication, accountability and transparency in decision\-making, use of worker data, as well as equity and no discrimination; 

-  *Fair representation*: the right to have a voice and be heard by the platform, the presence of clear processes for complaints and conflict resolution, and right to free association. 

 Each platform is scored on a three\-point scale – 0, 1 or 2 – for each principle, resulting in a total score from 0 to 10, on the basis of interviews with a platform representative and a random sample of workers, as well as desk research by the Foundation \[ **R4**\]. The Fairwork Principles serve as the first standardised method to evaluate the quality of digital platform labour. The criteria continue to be updated regularly through a process of active collaboration with platforms, workers, and unions, in order to respond to platform practices and the changing needs of digital workers. 

 In 2018 South Africa was the first country where the Principles were applied to examine the conditions of platform work \[ **R2**\]. It offered an appropriate test because the combination of high unemployment, policies that encourage digital entrepreneurship and good digital infrastructures have led to a substantial gig economy that both offers much\-needed livelihoods but also erodes labour standards.  The same methodology has since been used to evaluate the quality of digital labour platform work in 23 countries worldwide including India and Germany \(see Section 4 below\) with others including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, the UK, Ukraine, and the USA\). Application of a standardised methodology offers opportunities for comparative analysis and understanding of the changing character of labour markets worldwide \[e.g. **R5**\]. 

 Unease regarding the potential for digital labour platforms to undermine working conditions has intensified during the COVID\-19 pandemic, with many gig workers seeing their incomes disappear, or facing unsafe working practices. Graham’s team have surveyed the COVID\-19 policies of 120 platforms in 23 countries worldwide \[ **R6**\]. Scoring the platforms across the five principles of fair work \[ **R4**\], they demonstrated a clear gap between what workers needed to stay safe, and what platforms provided. The report’s recommendations include free provision of PPE for workers, including disinfectants, gloves and masks.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research above \[ **R1**\- **R6**\] has brought about positive change for gig workers and digital labour platforms in multiple countries and directly improved the conditions of employment that popular platforms offer to workers in South Africa, India and Germany. The examples below focus on three South African platforms where the improvements have been most developed. The research has also helped to tighten the health and safety legislation for gig workers during the COVID\-19 pandemic in the UK. Finally, the Fairwork Principles have also been embedded in government policy in Germany at both state \(Berlin\) and federal \(international development\) levels. 

 **Improving conditions for gig workers in South Africa** 

 In March 2019 and again in 2020 Fairwork published scores using the Principles framework for 10 platforms operating in South Africa \[ **R4**\]. The ranked platforms included global providers \(e.g. Uber, Bolt\) and local businesses. As part of this process, six platforms engaged in direct dialogue with Fairwork researchers, with three, NoSweat, SweepSouth and GetTOD, subsequently making changes to align their practices with the Fairwork Principles. These changes—concerning health and safety, grievance reporting, non\-discrimination, living wages, and freedom of association—directly impact many thousands of South African workers, improving their security and job quality. Specifically: 

-  The online freelancing platform **NoSweat** \(with over 13,000 registered freelancers in South Africa and the Netherlands\) scored 8 out of 10 points in 2019 and 2020 \[E1\]\). Active alignment with the Fairwork principles is stated on its website as “NoSweat fully supports the Fairwork Foundation's initiative” \[ **E2a**\]. In 2019, NoSweat developed a confidential grievance reporting portal, and adopted a contractual requirement for clients to protect workers’ health and safety \[ **E2b**\]. This contract requirement covers working hours, management and payment of overtime, and protection from injury and disease in the workplace. Companies working with NoSweat must agree to the requirement before hiring gig workers. Wilfred Greyling, NoSweat’s co\-founder, attributed this change to the Fairwork Foundation: “Fairwork has helped us formalise those principles and incorporate them into our systems” \[ **E3a**, **E3b**\]. As a result, the platform’s score on the Fair Contracts principle has increased from 1 in 2019 to the maximum 2 in 2020 \[ **E1**\]. In 2020, NoSweat stated that they observe the right to free association and accept collective worker representation \[ **E2b**\], which increased their score for the Fair Representation principle from 1 in 2019 to 2 in 2020 \[ **E1**\]. 

-  South African domestic work platform **SweepSouth**, which provides work for approximately 3,000 cleaners in Cape Town and Johannesburg, approached Fairwork when their score was lower than they had hoped \(7/10 points in 2019 \[ **E1**\]; insufficient data for ranking in 2020\). The Fairwork team indicated that it needed to meet the higher\-level condition for the ‘fair management’ principle and put in place a formal policy of no discrimination against workers. Following discussions with the Fairwork team, SweepSouth committed in 2020 to develop a formal policy of non\-discrimination against workers on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion/belief, age or any other legally protected characteristic \[ **E4**\]. This is an important step towards enabling workers to assert their rights and seek formal redress in an industry characterised by geographic, racial, and gender inequities. 

-  South African platform for tradespeople, **GetTOD**, made changes in early 2020 to align with Fairwork principles in order to receive a score of 8/10 in the 2020 rankings \[ **E1**\]. GetTOD is active in South Africa’s four largest cities – Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg and Pretoria – and connects demand and supply for many different services \(e.g. plumbing, pest control, flooring, cleaning\). GetTOD committed to paying a living wage, stating that: “We ensure that no service providers earn below the living wage \(as defined by Fairwork\), and our average compensation far exceeds this” \[ **E5**\]. They also clarified the disciplinary processes in clause 4.6 of the ‘partner terms’ for workers \[ **E6**\]. 

 **Legislative change to improve the wellbeing of UK gig workers during COVID\-19** 

 The Fairwork Principles \[ **R4**\] also played a role in a legal judgment in the UK, relating to gig economy workers’ rights in light of COVID\-19. **R6,** on the COVID\-19 response policies of 120 platforms in 23 countries, helped The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain \(IWUGB\) bring a case against the UK Department of Work and Pensions. Having contributed to **R6**, the IWUGB claimed that the UK had failed to provide gig workers with the health and safety protection to which they were entitled under EU health and safety law. The EU Directives conferred protections on ‘workers’ but in the UK this had only been applied to ‘employees’ – leaving millions of gig workers unprotected. The judgement was made in the IWUGB’s favour, directly citing **R6**: 

 “A report by the Fairwork Project \[i.e. **R6**\] … to which the Claimant contributed, made a number of recommendations including: regular, adequate, free provision of PPE – disinfectant, gloves and masks; installation of physical barriers between driver and passengers in all ride\-hailing cars; contact free supply chains \(both collection and delivery\) for delivery workers; daily sanitisation of vehicles and upstream locations – warehouses, hubs et cetera; and free COVID\-19 check\-ups for workers and their families.” \[ **E7**\] 

 As a result of this judgement, all UK workers now have the right to PPE and to refuse unsafe work. The judgment can be used in legal cases taken via the Health and Safety Executive, local authorities or employment tribunal claims. The IWUGB estimates that this will benefit at least 4,700,000 people working in the UK \[ **E8**\]. 

 **Fairwork Principles embedded in German policy** 

 The Berlin Senate Administration for Integration, Labour and Social Affairs – the state ministry and highest authority for integration, labour market and social policy – has shown strong interest in gig work conditions because of the rapid growth of digital labour platforms in the city. The Senate Administration have endorsed the Fairwork Principles. An article from January 2020 in the periodical of the Berliner MieterGemeinschaft \(one of Berlin’s largest tenant organisations\) confirmed that “\[t\]he Senate Administration for Integration, Labour and Social Affairs has commissioned a number of studies on the situation of gig workers and supports an initiative by the Fairwork Foundation and the Oxford Internet Institute \(OII\) to develop a certification system for fair work in the digital platform economy” \[ **E9**\]. The Senate support Berlin’s Fairwork Secretariat because its “stated aim is to put pressure on platform operators to improve working conditions” \[ **E9**\]. The Senate Administration for Integration, Labour and Social Affairs regularly organises international expert meetings and conferences. The September 2020 conference, at which the Fairwork Foundation’s research and ratings were discussed, focused on decent work in the platform economy \[ **E10**\]. The *12\-Point Policy Paper* \[ **E10**\] summarising the conference’s main results urges policymakers to promote positive approaches to fair working conditions, including platforms adopting voluntary commitments to decent work as defined by various codes of conduct. These approaches are exemplified by the Fairwork Foundation’s action\-research with platforms. 

 The research by Graham and colleagues has also been taken up at the national level. In 2018, the Federal Government of Germany adopted the Fairwork Principles \[ **R5**\] in its Digital Strategy, *Shaping Digitalization: Implementation strategy of the Federal Government* \[ **E11**\], seeking to find practical ways to support individuals and society at large through changes led by digitalization. The Strategy document says: “\[e\]very challenge we identify in the implementation strategy is mapped into a specific actionable solution. And every actionable solution is accompanied by an implementation plan” \[ **E11**\]. The document places a strong emphasis on how those actions enable Germany to support developing countries: “\[w\]e intend to specifically and responsibly promote the digital transformation in developing countries based on a partnership approach, to create a new outlook, and to thus lay the local foundation for a desirable future”. One of these challenges is to “subsidize the digital sector in developing countries: Cooperate with the private sector in the tech field and leverage digital trade” \[ **E11**\]. One of the five implementation steps in response is to “establish a certification system for fair work in the digital platform economy through the Oxford Internet Institute \(OII\) and the Fairwork Foundation” \[ **E11**\]. Having indicated Fairwork principles for platform work as one of its development priorities, in 2020 the German Government \(via GIZ\) provided more than EUR670,000 for the establishment of a Fairwork Secretariat to be based at Berlin Social Science Center \(WBZ\), the largest independent social science research institute that is not affiliated to a university in Europe \[ **E12**\]. The Secretariat is co\-directed by Graham and coordinates platform scoring, and policy and industry engagement across over 20 countries worldwide.

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Frost’s research on multi\-disciplinary work with vulnerable children and young people continues to change children’s lives and policy and practice. His policy framework of child\-centred, multi\-agency decision\-making has been adopted by North Yorkshire Local Safeguarding Children Board and has improved the work of the agencies involved in it. This policy framework has been adopted by Calderdale and then nationally through the National Children Bureau’s new best practice for safeguarding children. Frost’s research has changed and improved safeguarding policy in Ireland; and it has led to the creation of the European Family Support Network to spread good practice. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\)** 

 Since 2004 Professor Frost has had an active interest in child welfare and in particular multi\-disciplinary work with vulnerable children and young people. This has involved work funded by the ESRC, the MATCh project, 2004\-5 and EASI project, 2013\-15, and various projects funded by Leeds City Council 2010 – 2016. In this period Frost has worked alone and with others to challenge practice and change policies in local and central government to ensure that children and young people are given better protection in the UK and Ireland \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\). The purpose of the research, then, is to have an impact on professional practice, social work policies and the workers and young people in the system. The research here is multi\-disciplinary, combining policy analysis, critical reflection on practice and qualitative research with professionals. He has undertaken a critical appraisal of child protection Serious Case Reviews in England \(3.5\). He has evaluated the changing nature of social work in the UK \(3.2\). He has explored what is best practice in interagency working with children and families \(3.6\). And he has interviewed 14 professionals \(including 8 in focus groups\) working in Child Sexual Exploitation cases supporting the victims to identify the need for therapeutic support for these case workers \(3.1\). 

 The key research in this period is ‘Developing Multi\-Professional Work for Integrated Children’s Services’ \(3.3\). The work promotes multi\-disciplinary work in order to promote improved outcomes for disadvantaged children and young people. The findings are that: 

-  The concept of ‘communities of practice’ devised by Etienne Wenger can be transferred to work with children and young people 

-  Different professional backgrounds bring their unique skill set to such work but can work together to devise a holistic approach 

-  Professionals can share differing approaches and values and constructively overcome differences with effective leadership 

-  Confidentiality and information sharing are major barriers to shared working and require explicit policies and protocols to overcome barriers 

-  Co\-location of professionals works well in over\-coming barriers to effective multi\-professional working. 

 These points were also addressed by the ERSC EASI project which produced practical policies and protocols for frontline professionals.  Professor Frost pursued these themes in relation to multi\-professional teams and sexually exploited children and young people. This research is a continuation of the work that was submitted by the University in the previous REF. The research in this period has continued to make new contributions to the problem of looking after vulnerable children and young people in the UK and Ireland, and beyond \(3.4\). The research in this period has continued to evaluate the best ways of supporting workers who look after those vulnerable young children. This research, then, like the previous research, has been about shaping practice and policies so that lives are improved.

 **4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)** 

 Frost has remained the Chair of the Local Safeguarding Children Board \(LSCB\) for the North Yorkshire area \(NYSCB\) since the last REF period. The policy framework in 3.6 and 3.3 and their child\-centred recommendations have been adopted in NYSCB, ensuring that all the agencies in NYSCB together support and improve the lives of all children brought into their work. That is, the agencies \(North Yorkshire County Council \[NYCC\] Children’s Service, Police and local NHS groups\), led by NYSCB \(also known as North Yorkshire Safeguarding Children Partnership: 5.1\) have changed their policies and practice on how they work with children who are at risk, and have intervened to support and improve the lives of hundreds of children. NYCC Children’s Service has been assessed by Ofsted in August 2018 as Outstanding \(5.2\) – up from Good \(5.3\) \- across all areas. 

 Frost was then appointed as Chair of Calderdale LSCB in September 2017 \(5.4\) allowing his research’s model of best practice \(3.3, 3.6\) to be adopted by the agencies involved, so that more children were safeguarded by effective multi\-agency working. The LCSBs were reformed in 2019 and Frost led a successful bid by Calderdale to become an ‘early adopter’ of the new arrangements. 17 areas were successful and their initiatives – including Frost’s best practice on multi\-agency working with vulnerable children \- were used by the National Children’s Bureau to create national policy on the new arrangements \(5.5\). 

 As a result of his published research in the previous REF period Professor Frost acted as research advisor to the Republic of Ireland government \(2014\-2015\) and impacted on its policies working together to save vulnerable children through the creation of formal multi\-disciplinary agencies. This led to the publication of Better Outcomes Brighter Future report by TUSLA, the Irish Government’s Child and Family Agency \(5.6\) Frost, then, has directly influenced Irish policy and practice through Ireland embracing his policy framework on child\-centred, multi\-agency safeguarding  \(3.3, 3.6\). The Republic has been amongst the leaders in developing child\-centred, multi\-professional working and the practices that evolved in these early stages are now established across the Republic. As reported by UNESCO Professor for Children and Youth and Director of Ireland’s largest Children’s Research Centre Professor Pat Nolan, National University of Ireland \(NUI\), Galway, Ireland, who commissioned Frost to work with him for TUSLA \(5.7\): 

 *Frost provided comprehensive guidance… to the on\-going process of Tusla’s Family Support methods of service delivery development ensuring better outcomes for children, parents, families and communities who experience adversity. This was most evident in terms of his expert knowledge on the best models for supporting young people and prevention of maltreatment… without his expertise, our advanced policies now implemented and services now in place, would have remained aspirational rather than actual.  We are indebted to Professor Frost for this sharing of his expertise, which has impacted very positively indeed in real ways on the lives of young people and families.* 

 Finally, Frost was a founding member of the European Family Support Network \(5.8\), which was created using the policy recommendations of the research \(3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5\) to improve the lives of children and families across Europe. Together with Dolan, NUI, Galway, he convened the inaugural meeting at the UNESCO headquarters, Paris. The network now includes representatives from over 20 European countries – the aim is to have a lasting impact on family support policy and practice across the continent by drawing on the recommendations of his research. Frost took a lead on the initial policy statement and the theoretical framework. The Network made a successful COST bid to the EU \(Action CA18123 EuroFam\-Net\) in 2018. Workstreams address policy, research and workforce development, and have an extensive reach across the continent. The work has produced models for workforce development, evaluation practice and good family support practice.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by EaStCHEM Professor Paul Barlow and colleagues has provided atomic resolution insights into the structure, function, and interactions of factor H \(FH\), a key human blood protein that stops the immune system from attacking self\-cells. These advances, along with the group’s novel recombinant method for production of FH in large quantities, have underpinned the creation of, and the technology behind, two new companies, *Gemini Therapeutics* and *Invizius*. Each company has developed unique interventions that harness FH to reduce damage to human cells caused by immune system attack: *Gemini* with its precision medicine approach to prevent blindness caused by age\-related macular degeneration; and *Invizius* with its *H\-Guard*<sup>®</sup> technology to suppress, at source, the immune system reaction to the dialysis filter as a foreign body and the resulting cardiovascular damage. 

 In only five years, *Gemini* has raised investment of USD42,000,000 \(with a further USD216,000,000 committed as of 12\-2020\) and has created 40 jobs. It has succeeded in manufacturing recombinant FH for clinical use, which is currently progressing through Phase II clinical trials. *Invizius*, since 2015, has created 9 jobs and raised investment of GBP3,855,500, with offers for a further GBP4,200,000 secured as of 12\-2020 to fund full clinical trials of *H\-Guard*<sup>®</sup>.

#  2. Underpinning research 

##  The challenge: understanding the complement system for development of new therapies 

 As part of the human immune system, the 30 blood\-borne proteins that comprise the complement system work together to defend the body against invading microbes and to clear debris arising from damaged or dying human cells. Inappropriate or disproportionate activation of the complement system causes numerous autoimmune, degenerative and inflammatory diseases, as well as undesirable inflammatory responses to medical interventions. Factor H \(FH\) is a key human complement\-regulating protein that protects healthy “self” tissue from attack by the complement system. The ability to control complement attack through harnessing the regulatory action of FH presents exciting opportunities for the development of therapies. Rational design of such therapeutic strategies requires an in\-depth knowledge of the structure and mode of action of complement proteins, including FH; however, advances in understanding how complement proteins function have been held back by a lack of detailed structural insight. Difficulty in producing FH in sufficient quantities has also been a barrier to its therapeutic use. 

##  A multidisciplinary approach to understanding regulation of the complement system 

 EaStCHEM Professor Paul Barlow performs world\-leading research on the human complement system and has published nearly 100 papers on the topic. Following deployment of synthetic biology approaches to recombinant production and glycoengineering of complement proteins, he uses techniques including NMR spectroscopy, X\-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance \(on custom\-made biomimetic sensor chips\) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer to study these proteins on an atomic level. This research has brought major progress towards an understanding of the structure and function of complement proteins, which serves as the basis for their therapeutic application. 

##  Structure and function of FH at atomic\-level resolution 

 With EaStCHEM colleagues Dr Andrew Herbert and Professor Dušan Uhrín, Barlow’s research since 2008 has revealed how FH interacts with key molecular partners that are crucial to its protective function. These include the complement protein fragment C3b, which initiates complement\-mediated attack and is FH’s primary target when protecting self\-cells, as well as the carbohydrates that act as markers of self\-cell surfaces. The team mapped key functional sites of FH and proposed a model, now widely accepted, in which the central domains of FH act in a hinge\-like fashion to bring together the C3b\-interacting domains at either end of the FH protein, thus initiating a cooperative binding modality that inhibits complement attack **\[R1\]**. By revealing the functional importance of all 20 domains within FH, Barlow’s model makes clear that the full\-length molecule, despite the challenges associated with its synthesis, is likely to be the best candidate for developing therapeutic approaches for complement suppression. The group has also studied genetic mutations that compromise FH’s ability to bind C3b and carbohydrates markers, thus weakening its ability to protect cells in two human organs, the kidney and eye **\[R2\]**. In the eye, this leads to the creation of extracellular deposits in the macula, signalling the early stages of age\-related macular degeneration \(AMD\). 

##  Discovery of enhanced FH action to stop complement attack 

 The group, with key input from Herbert, then examined the ability of some bacteria to hijack FH to protect themselves against complement system attack **\[R3\]**. They found that a domain of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* protein PspC \(a PspC truncate, PspCN\) not only binds the full\-length of FH extraordinarily tightly \( *K*<sub>D</sub> in the picomolar range\) but also enhances the regulatory functions of FH by binding to its central hinge\-like region and stabilising its active structure **\[R3\]**. Binding to PspCN doubles FH affinity for C3b and increases fivefold its ability to suppress complement activation. This inspired the group to exploit these bacterial FH\-binding proteins to stop complement activation and the resulting damage triggered when blood comes into contact with foreign surfaces such as dialysis filters, medical devices such as stents and catheters, or transplanted organs. Patent protection for the invention was granted in 2015 **\[R4\]**. 

##  First recombinant production of FH 

 The development of FH\-based therapies had been constrained by difficulties in scaling up its production, with sources restricted to human blood plasma or inadequate quantities generated by expression in cultured plant, mammalian or insect cells. In 2011, the Barlow group developed a novel method to make significant quantities of FH recombinantly by transforming cells of the yeast *Pichia pastoris* with a proprietary designer FH gene **\[R5\]**. With subsequent improvements, this method produces hundreds of milligrams of protein per litre of culture, far more than other technologies can currently produce. Patent protection for the method was granted in 2011 **\[R6\]**.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Two new companies have been formed to develop unique clinical interventions that exploit the ability of the complement\-control protein FH to protect our own cells from damage. The intellectual property of these companies stems directly from insights into the structure\-function relationships of FH, and recombinant technology for its bioproduction, provided by EaStCHEM Professor Paul Barlow and colleagues. In the five years since its co\-founding by Barlow and Dr Andrew Herbert, in 2015, *Gemini* has raised investment of USD42,000,000 \(with a further USD216,000,000 committed as of 12\-2020\) and created 40 jobs. *Invizius*, since 2015, has raised investment of GBP3,855,500 \(with offers for a further GBP4,200,000 secured as of 12\-2020\) and created 9 jobs \(headcount: 9; FTEs: 9\). 

##  Formation of *Gemini Therapeutics* to target a cure for dry age\-related macular degeneration \(AMD\) 

 *Gemini Therapeutics* is a precision medicine company focused on the development of new therapies for dry AMD, the leading cause of irreversible blindness amongst people over 50 in the developed world. In many patients, dry AMD results from mutations in FH that reduce its protective action on self\-cells and allow the immune system, over time, to damage cells in the eye. According to a 2014 study published in *The Lancet* \(DOI: 10.1016/ 

 S2214\-109X\(13\)70145\-1\), 2,500,000 patients globally would benefit from a therapy that restores FH functionality. The company has raised over USD42,000,000 in seed and Series A funding since 2016 and created employment for over 40 staff, mainly PhD\-level scientists **\[S1\]**. 

 Research from the Barlow group underpinned the development and viability of *Gemini*’s lead therapeutic approach and was key to initial fund\-raising and company set up **\[S1\]**. Barlow’s research provides a deep understanding of the structure\-function relationships of FH that underlie disease mechanisms. It established the feasibility and desirability of treating AMD by administering FH **\[R2\]** and showed the full\-length protein to be the best therapeutic candidate **\[R1\]**. The full\-length FH\-replacement strategy attracted the attention of the biotechnology entrepreneur who would become *Gemini’*s first CEO and became the new company’s lead approach. Recognizing that FH had been “ *notoriously difficult to produce in quantities sufficient to support clinical use*” **\[S1\]**, he initiated contact with the Barlow lab in 2015. He concluded that their novel recombinant method for production of FH **\[R6\]** was “ *clearly superior to known alternatives*”, and that partnership with the Barlow group presented “ *a unique opportunity to very rapidly get the company he envisaged off the ground*” **\[S1\]**. Barlow and Herbert were scientific co\-founders of *Gemini* **\[S2\]**, and the Barlow lab continues to provide guidance on the FH\-replacement approach and on progressing the protein product towards clinical use **\[S1\]**. These contributions shaped *Gemini’*s plans and enabled the founders to convince investors that the company would be in “ *a uniquely strong position to get products to market within a compressed timeframe*” **\[S1\]**. Licensing options of the Barlow patents also proved to be a crucial component of *Gemini’*s IP portfolio during fund raising. 

 The creation of *Gemini Therapeutics* presents a unique opportunity to work towards a therapy for AMD. They are the first company to apply a precision medicine approach, targeted to the specific genetics of patients, to ocular diseases, and the only company that has succeeded in manufacturing recombinant FH \(called *GEM\-103*\) for use in the clinic **\[S1\]**. 

##  Progress of *Gemini Therapeutics* 

 Phase 1 clinical trials of *GEM\-103*, completed in 2020, met all safety endpoints and, importantly, provided evidence of the desired therapeutic effect: injection of *GEM\-103* to the eye produced a prolonged increased in levels of FH that supports the desired mechanism of action **\[S3\]**. The Phase 2a ReGAtta study commenced enrolment in 09\-2020 **\[S3\]**. A proposal for Fast Track designation was submitted and positively reviewed by the FDA in late 2020 \(approval announced 09\-01\-2021\). In parallel, *Gemini* began optimising their precision medicine approach through *CLARITY*, a major genetic profiling study designed to provide unprecedented insight into the role of genetic risk in retinal diseases \(launched 01\-2019\) **\[S1, S4\]**. 

 The strength of *Gemini’s* precision medicine approach, together with positive Phase 1 clinical trial results, have attracted a “blank\-cheque” “ *Special Purpose Acquisition Company*” \(SPAC\), providing a route to take the company public. In 10\-2020, *Gemini Therapeutics* and *FS Development Corp.* announced a merger agreement creating “ *Gemini Therapeutics, Inc.”* and providing funding of USD121,000,000 to advance *Gemini*’s pipeline, plus a further USD95,000,000 of private investment **\[S5\]**. The combined company’s common stock is expected to be listed on Nasdaq in early 2021 **\[S5\]**. This provides a solid foundation for future progress. 

##  Formation of *Invizius* to target cardiovascular damage caused by dialysis 

 *Invizius* spun out from the University of Edinburgh in 04\-2018 to develop a breakthrough technology to reduce cardiovascular damage caused by dialysis **\[S6\]**, which currently kills almost half of all dialysis patients worldwide and reduces life expectancy to just one third of normal **\[S6\]**. The *Invizius* technology is underpinned by Herbert and Barlow’s research **\[R6\]** that discovered the possibility of exploiting pathogenic bacteria PspCN to recruit and enhance the action of FH to prevent immune system attack on medical devices, and the inflammation and cardiovascular damage that results **\[S6\]**. The initial focus of *Invizius* has been the incorporation of this technology through a priming solution, *H\-Guard*<sup>®</sup>, which coats the dialysis filter and very tightly sequesters FH from the patient’s blood to render the device invisible to the immune system \(Figure 1\). The *Invizius* approach is unique in preventing, at source, the blood’s reaction to the foreign body, rather than treating the consequences, which presents the first major innovation in dialysis filter haemocompatibility since the 1980s **\[S6\]**. 

 

 **Figure 1**: Dialysis filter coated with H\-Guard<sup>®</sup> priming solution to hide the device from immune system attack. Image credit: Invizius. 

Invizius has raised investment of GBP3,855,500 to support development of the technology **\[S6\]**. Commercial and technology development between 06\-2015 and 03\-2018 was funded with support totalling GBP605,500 from Scottish Enterprise's High\-Growth Spinout Programme \(HGSP\). The success of translational activities under the HGSP funding paved the way for the spin out of *Invizius*, with Herbert as founder and Chief Technology Officer and Barlow as scientific advisor **\[S7\]**. *Mercia Technologies* invested GBP500,000 of seed funding in 04\-2018. A further GBP2,750,000 raised in 10\-2019 has supported the company as it conducts pre\-clinical testing and manufacturing, and preparation for its therapy to enter clinical trials **\[S8\]**. The company has created employment for 9 staff \(headcount: 9; FTEs: 9\) **\[S6\]**. Approximately 40% of development spend is outsourced to contract research and contract manufacturing organisations in the UK and Europe, supporting this valuable sector of the economy more widely **\[S6\]**. 

##  Progress of *Invizius* 

 By 12\-2020, *Invizius* had demonstrated success in key areas, confirming the promise of the technology and paving the way for First\-in\-Human studies **\[S6\]**. *Ex vivo* testing in rigs that model the dialysis blood circuit has shown a marked reduction in complement activation when the dialysis filter circuit is coated with *H\-Guard*<sup>®</sup>, providing confidence in the efficacy of the priming solution. Importantly, this reduction occurs in the crucial first hour of contact with the filter, which is known to trigger the maximum immune response. Results also indicate that *H\-Guard*<sup>®</sup> is effective in bringing complement activation down to a baseline level, even in cases where it otherwise would be high. 

 Other major achievements include successful completion of acute toxicology studies in animals, full development of the protein manufacturing process, and demonstration of the production yields necessary to produce *H\-Guard*<sup>®</sup> at a cost that is commercially viable in the dialysis market **\[S6\]**. Success in these areas has underpinned *Invizius*’s next round of investment: as of 12\-2020 the company has secured Series A offers amounting to GBP4,200,000 **\[S6\]**, to fund the development of the *H\-Guard*<sup>®</sup> technology to and through first\-in\-human studies. 

 In recognition of their innovative solution to a major health need, *Invizius* have been named one of the “ *Fierce 15*” Med Tech Companies of 2018, as well as ‘ *Best Innovative MedTech’* at the 2018 OBN Awards **\[S9\]**.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research undertaken by Strathclyde’s Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship \(HCE\) has informed entrepreneurial policy, improved Scotland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem and supported the growth of entrepreneurial ventures. Through collaboration with the Scottish Government, regional enterprise support organisations and membership organisations, this research has: informed the development of a policy framework to accelerate Scotland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem \(Scotland CAN DO\); contributed to raising the global profile of Scotland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem from 13th to 5th in the Global Entrepreneurship Development Index \(GEDI\) of innovation\-driven nations; and informed the design of a suite of entrepreneurship leadership programmes focused on scaling high potential ventures, including the ScaleUp Institute\-endorsed Growth Advantage Programme. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 While the UK and Scotland have a strong tradition of business start\-ups, their track record of growing businesses compares less favourably with other prosperous economies including the Group of Eight \(G8\) highly industrialised nations. Under\-developed entrepreneurial ecosystems \(EE\) is a key reason for this, with new firms often lacking access to the resources, talent, infrastructure, markets and other forms of support needed to grow. This is despite the UK’s well\-educated and diverse workforce, strong science and engineering base, ‘business\-friendly’ regulations and investment in research. Evidence from economies with vibrant EE shows that firms that grow make significant contributions to job creation, productivity and the Gross Value Added \(GVA\) of the goods and services produced. Recognising this, Strathclyde’s Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship has engaged in a sustained programme of research to: better understand EEs; identify policy interventions which can improve Scotland’s EE; and investigate entrepreneurial practices that help firms grow. 

###  Entrepreneurial Ecosystems \(EE\) 

 Between 2000 and 2018, Professor Levie played a lead role in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor \(GEM\) which provides annual comparative assessments of national entrepreneurial activity rates across a networked consortium of now 115 countries. GEM collects and analyses survey data across this consortium to: identify levels of entrepreneurial activity; uncover factors leading to appropriate levels of entrepreneurship; and suggest policies to enhance national levels of entrepreneurial activity through improvements to EEs. Since 2000, Strathclyde has managed the GEM UK project in partnership with Aston Business School and taken sole responsibility for reporting on Scotland. In parallel, Levie provided a theory\-grounded examination of the GEM model and tested the effect of education and training for entrepreneurship \(an identified Entrepreneurial Framework Condition\) on the allocation of effort into venture creation. He found a positive relationship between post\-secondary education and increased entrepreneurial activity, especially in high\-income economies \[ **R1**\]. GEM data was subsequently used in a number of investigations, notably the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \(MIT\) Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program \(REAP Scotland\). Between 2012 and 2014, as the only academic member of REAP Scotland, Levie contributed to a detailed investigation to quantify Scotland’s EE; benchmark this internationally using GEDI and engage in deep and broad stakeholder consultation across the EE. This analysis identified 5 actions to improve Scotland’s EE including improvements in networking linkages, skills for growth and access to growth finance as well as leveraging university expertise and promoting innovation\-driven entrepreneurship; Task Groups were then formed to progress these \[ **R2**\]. Levie later undertook an empirical analysis of the outcomes of REAP which concluded that after almost 3 decades of a ‘top down’ market failure approach to entrepreneurial policy, an ecosystems management approach involving deep engagement with stakeholders was more effective in enhancing Scotland’s EE. 

###  Firm growth \- the role of networking practices 

 Professors Shaw and Dodd have engaged in a sustained body of research investigating firm growth across diverse contexts including female, graduate, creative, craft, and Black, Asian and minority ethnic \(BAME\) entrepreneurs. Their analysis of entrepreneurial growth has drawn heavily from sociological theoretical perspectives including Social Network Theory and Bourdieu’s work on ‘Capital theory’ and his concept of ‘Habitus’, to identify and understand  those entrepreneurial practices that help firms grow.  For example, Shaw’s qualitative study of small firm networks \[ **R3**\] identified the benefits of networking for firm sustainability and growth and provided insights into entrepreneurs’ motivations for networking and the networking practices they employ. Subsequent research, examining the lived experiences of 10 craft entrepreneurs, revealed previously unidentified forms of capital conversions, demonstrated that the conversion process can involve multiple forms of capital and showed that such entrepreneurs give no primacy to economic capital \[ **R4**\]. Alongside this, analysis of graduate entrepreneurs’ networking practices \[ **R5**\] identified distinct patterns which impacted their ability to access resources contained in networks. This body of research recommended policy interventions flexible enough to unlock the entrepreneurial potential of different groups of entrepreneurs through tailored leadership development, introductions to role models and advice on how to build both strong and diverse networks. This research also identified that ‘growth’ is defined by entrepreneurs in different ways and recommended that alternative approaches to analysing the impact of interventions on growth should be developed. Complementary to this, Professor Lockett’s recent 3\-country study of entrepreneurial learning found that both formal and non\-formal learning remain important foundations for the development of entrepreneurial competences.  Through in\-depth analysis of 18 life stories, focusing on self\-identified critical incidents to identify ways in which graduate entrepreneurs develop entrepreneurial competence while at university, this research highlighted the particular importance of informal learning through networks, especially mentor supported socialised learning \[ **R6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Through sustained engagement with policy makers and other key entrepreneurial bodies and institutions at Scottish and UK levels, since August 2013 research conducted by Strathclyde’s Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship \(HCE\) has: 

-  Informed Scottish Government policy and strengthened Scotland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem by providing evidence\-based recommendations for stakeholders; and 

-  Supported the growth of Scottish Small and Medium Size Enterprises \(SMEs\) through programmes designed to improve entrepreneurial leadership. 

###  Informed Scottish Government policy and strengthened Scotland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem 

 Research undertaken by Strathclyde’s HCE informed the development of the Scottish Government’s Scotland CAN DO \(SCD\) strategy \(published November 2013\) and subsequent action framework \(published April 2014\) \[ **S1a**\]. Intended to drive business creation and growth through nurturing an entrepreneurial ecosystem which recognises the relationships between innovation and firm growth, SCD responds to the recommendation that an ecosystems management approach focused on deep engagement with stakeholders will be more effective than top down policy interventions \[ **R2**\]. This influence on policy is acknowledged by the former Head of Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Support Policy for the Scottish Government \(2012\-19\), who was heavily involved in the design and implementation of SCD: 

 ‘In set\-up, scope and delivery, I collaborated extensively with academics from the Hunter Centre of Entrepreneurship \(HCE\), Strathclyde Business School. This research was essential in developing this ecosystem. I would note that the HCE is the ‘go\-to’ academic institution to support the development of enterprise policy in Scotland and one of its most significant impacts is the contribution that HCE research has made to the Scotland CAN DO framework – the Scottish Government’s core enterprise policy… the contribution of the HCE to the REAP project and its resulting published findings \[ **R2**\] were fundamental for the Scottish Government and partners in developing the Scotland CAN DO agenda’ \[ **S1b**\]. 

 Affirming this, the Chief Executive of the Entrepreneurial Scotland Foundation \(ESF\) notes, ‘HCE’s research and engagement with the entrepreneurial ecosystem and policy makers in Scotland has helped shaped Scottish government policy on entrepreneurship. HCE’s REAP \[ **R2**\] and GEM \[ **R1**\] research created the foundations on which the Scottish Government developed and adopted the Scotland CAN DO framework’ \[ **S2a**\]. This is reflected in the CAN DO strategy itself, which cites Strathclyde’s GEM research \[ **S1a** p.13\]. As noted in an ESF briefing, which draws on Strathclyde’s 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Development Index \(GEDI\) analysis commissioned by Scottish Enterprise, ‘this approach – along with the combined efforts of the entrepreneurial community – has seen Scotland’s support ecosystem ranked as the 5th most effective globally, up from 13th in 2013, and a doubling of the proportion of Scots actively trying to start a business’ \[ **S2b**\]. A key driver of this has been the Scottish EDGE fund, a competition aimed at identifying and supporting Scotland’s entrepreneurial talent which ‘embodies the CAN DO approach’ \[ **S3**\]. Now the biggest business funding competition in the UK, to date Scottish Edge has created 1858 jobs, supported 428 businesses, increased their turnover by GBP151,000,000 and leveraged GBP124,000,000 in additional investment \[ **S4a**\]. According to an independent evaluation conducted in 2019, over the previous 5 years the competition generated gross value added \(GVA\) of GBP67,900,000 for the Scottish economy; this represents a return on investment of GBP7.30 to GBP8.50 in net additional GVA for every pound of public money spent on the fund \[ **S4b**\]. 

 As well as influencing government policy, Strathclyde has strengthened Scotland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem by providing research\-based advice to key stakeholders. Responding to the recommendation that impact analyses take account of the different ways in which ‘growth’ is defined by entrepreneurs \( **R3**\- **R5**\), an evaluation undertaken by HCE in 2015 for Archangels Investors Ltd \(an Edinburgh\-based angel syndicate investing in high\-risk, early stage knowledge intensive companies with growth potential\) employed a mixed\-methods approach to capture the economic impact of the syndicate’s activities as well as its commercial performance. As well as informing the company, this detailed evaluation supported the case for additional government funding \[ **S5a**\]. Reflecting on the benefits, the Archangels’ Managing Director observes: 

 *‘Thanks to methodology developed for the evaluation, we have improved the way we measure our impact and thus we are continuously enhancing our processes and activities with significant benefits for the SME ecosystem in Scotland. Secondly, as this research has become embedded in our practices, we have noticed a significant increase in the number of investors participating in the syndicate’s activities and funding, as well as an increase in the number of SMEs being funded by our members’* \[ **S5b**\]. 

 The report was also used by LINC Scotland, the national association for business angels in Scotland, to lobby the Scottish Government. According to LINC Scotland’s Chief Executive: 

 ‘Research undertaken by the HCE, in particular the Archangels Impact Evaluation Report the launch of which the then Deputy First Minister John Swinney attended and spoke at, has helped make the case to the Scottish Government to replace the funding lost for the region since 2019 when the European Regional Development Fund stopped. This research demonstrated the significant return on investment accrued through investing in innovation\-driven enterprises and we welcomed the announcement of the additional GBP100,000,000 to be provided by the Scottish Government through the Scottish Growth Scheme’ \[ **S6**\]. 

###  Supported growth of Scottish Small and Medium Size Enterprises \(SMEs\) 

 Alongside influencing policy and strengthening the ecosystem, Strathclyde’s HCE has supported the growth of Scottish SMEs by shaping the design and delivery of a suite of leadership development programmes for entrepreneurs. Underpinned by HCE research evidencing entrepreneurial practices and competencies that help firms grow \[ **R3**\- **R6**\], these programmes have focused on the sustained growth of established ventures as well as a bespoke accelerator programme for early stage, high potential firms to help scale their propositions. In doing so, HCE has responded to the REAP recommendations \[ **R2**\] that Scotland’s EE should be improved through better networking linkages, improved skills for growth and effective leveraging of university expertise to achieve these and promote innovation\-driven entrepreneurship. 

####  Established firms 

 Through its design and delivery of the Growth Advantage Programme \(GAP\), Strathclyde’s HCE has had a positive impact on the growth outcomes of established firms. Piloted in 2015 with funding from Santander, GAP is now in its fifth cohort and has supported 83 founders in further growing their ventures. Partnerships with Scottish Enterprise \(SE\), Highlands and Islands Enterprise \(HIE\) and Glasgow City Council \(GCC\) have informed recruitment to ensure that participating entrepreneurs are well\-placed to benefit from the programme. This is confirmed by SE’s Head of Scaling Services, who notes, ‘given the impact that GAP has had on the growth of participating ventures, we frequently recommend GAP to clients with ambition and potential to grow and to grow at scale’ \[ **S7**\]. 

 Evidence of impact is provided by an evaluation of GAP undertaken in 2020 using a methodology approved by the ScaleUp Institute \(SUI\) and Arup. As outlined by the Chief Executive of SUI, this established that \(relative to a control group of SMEs which has not participated in a growth programme\) the average turnover and growth in employees of GAP participant firms was statistically significantly higher \[ **S8**\]. Further, the first cohort of participants experienced turnover growth of 17.6% one year after starting GAP with their cumulative turnover growth after 4 years rising to 70.7% \[ **S8**\]. This evaluation ‘established that participants upon completion of the programme had gained: improved management skills; increased confidence in leadership and decision making; motivation to grow the business further; liberation from every day\-to\-day management activities in order to lead the business more effectively \[and\]; a supportive network of peers \[ **S8**\]. Undertaken during the Covid\-19 pandemic, it also ‘observed that the GAP programme had impacted the participants’ response to the pandemic and their ability to recover’, with the key benefits being ‘forward thinking, strategic thinking, capability to use business planning tools \[and\] access to support network’ \[ **S8**\]. As a direct result of this impact evaluation, GAP received the full endorsement of SUI making it one of only two UK entrepreneurial leadership development programmes informed by academic research and designed and delivered by a university. 

 Based on evidence of the benefits of GAP, Be the Business \(an independent charity established in 2017 to boost the productivity of small businesses\) invited Strathclyde’s HCE to help develop and deliver its leadership programme. According to the charity’s Chief Executive, through the work of Professors Lockett, Shaw and Anderson, HCE has ‘been critical to the roll out of our ‘Productivity through People Programme’; a mini\-MBA for leaders of small businesses to develop their leadership and management capabilities’ \[ **S9a**\]. To date, Strathclyde has engaged with 39 participants across two cohorts and recently helped with the rapid creation of our ‘Rebuild Programme’; a resource for small businesses to support their recovery from the economic impact of the Covid\-19 pandemic’ \[ **S9a**\]. Alongside this, HCE research also informed Be the Business’s ‘recommendation to the UK Government, leading to investment in the Small Business Leadership Programme and Peers Network in 2020’ \[ **S9a**\]. As reported by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\), these ‘2 schemes represent a GBP20,000,000 investment by BEIS…to enhance resilience and recovery from the impact of COVID\-19 and enable SME’s to develop their potential for future growth and productivity’ \[ **S9b**\]. 

####  Early\-stage, high potential firms 

 Using evidence showing that entrepreneurs at different stages require different types of leadership development and support \[ **R3**\- **R6**\], HCE worked with Glasgow City Council and Highlands and Islands Enterprise to design leadership development engagements for high potential innovation\-driven entrepreneurs. Outlining the details of the GCC’s programme, the Group Manager for Business Growth notes: ‘Building on the impact of GAP on the growth of more established ventures, DRG have worked with HCE researchers, principally Professor Eleanor Shaw and Dr John Anderson to ask them to draw upon their research to design and deliver a similar programme but targeted at early\-stage innovation driven enterprises. The resulting programme, iGAP@Tontine, was piloted in 2018 and our resulting impact evaluation of the programme evidenced that it was successful in providing participating entrepreneurs with access to a research\-informed, peer to peer learning experience which specifically improved key objectives of the programme’ \[ **S10**\].

growth and development as well as policies aimed at improving productivity and firm growth in various forms. Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted by the University of Central Lancashire’s Healthy & Sustainable Settings Unit has been instrumental to the adoption of the ‘whole system’ settings approach to promoting health and wellbeing within higher education. Internationally, the publication of a Charter for Health Promoting Universities and the establishment of an International Steering Group chaired by Dooris, has seen the adoption of the Healthy Universities model by over 400 universities across more than 35 countries. Nationally, there has also been an adoption and endorsement of the whole system Healthy Universities model by Universities UK, Student Minds and other national bodies. At an institutional level, the adoption and implementation of the Healthy Universities approach has provided a model for promoting student, staff and community wellbeing by 86 UK higher education Institutions \(HEIs\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 1995, the University of Central Lancashire became one of the first HEIs to establish a Healthy University initiative, adopting and applying learning from the healthy settings approach previously developed by the World Health Organization \(WHO\) in multiple contexts such as schools, hospitals and cities. More than two decades on, it is widely acknowledged to be a world leader in research, knowledge exchange and practice pertaining to this field of work. 

 <ins> **Phase I \(2001\-2007\) – Conceptual Development:**</ins> 

 Dooris formulated a conceptual framework for healthy settings with three characteristics: an ecological model of health promotion, systems perspective and whole system organisational change focus. Additionally, he proposed new models to guide healthy settings practice \[1\] and highlighted key challenges in evaluating healthy setting initiatives, work that was further developed in collaboration with colleagues from other countries that drew on complexity theory and critical realism. To test these theoretical developments, Dooris also undertook international empirical research with WHO and other global leaders for healthy settings. 

 <ins> **Phase II \(2008\-2013\) – Regional/National Studies and Further Conceptual Research:**</ins> 

 Dooris conducted a multi\-method study, funded by the Higher Education Academy and the Department of Health, examining Healthy Universities activity in English HEIs and exploring opportunities for national programme development. Findings confirmed and illustrated how HEIs can impact positively on student, staff and community wellbeing and demonstrated how Healthy Universities can contribute not only to health targets but also to business agendas such as recruitment, experience and retention. Dooris and colleagues followed with a high\-profile implementation project, funded by HEFCE. Commissioned under the Labour government but completed under the Coalition government, research funded by the Royal Society for Public Health led to a new conceptual model that has been widely used and further developed. Dooris collaborated with Blake Poland \(University of Toronto\) to develop new theory regarding the integration of health and sustainability within and across settings. 

 <ins> **Phase III \(2014\-\) – National and International Developments:**</ins> 

 Dooris collaborated with London South Bank University to research understandings of Healthy Universities, extending healthy settings theorisation, examining implementation and exploring implications \[2\-3\]. He collaborated with Judy Orme \(UWE\) and Sharon Doherty to develop the concept of salutogenesis in Healthy Universities and undertook consultative research with Canadian colleagues to inform the development of the Okanagan International Charter for Health Promoting Universities and Colleges. Dooris and Farrier collaborated with Manchester Metropolitan University \(MMU\) to undertake four further projects: a\) an international mixed\-method study exploring how the Healthy Universities Self\-Review Tool has supported universities and how its impact could be enhanced \[4\]; b\) a global study using interviews, focus groups and  questionnaires with vice chancellors, network co\-ordinators and network members to critically examine understandings of whole university approaches and leadership for Healthy Universities, funded by the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education \[5\]; c\) a mixed\-method national study evaluating engagement with and perceptions of the UK Healthy Universities Network \[6\]; d\) a national study scoping students’ perceptions of Healthy Universities. This research \[2\-6\] has reached global audiences through outputs providing policy and practice guidance on Healthy Settings and via the web pages of WHO. They identify UCLan as the originator of Healthy Universities along with the International Union for Health Promotion & Education. This is the professional association for global health, equity and wellbeing.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins> **International Level: Global Priorities and Expert Guidance**</ins> 

 **“UCLan’s research has…helped shape the influential Okanagan Charter…\[and\] had significant impact at institutional, national and international levels – with the theoretical and empirical insights having far\-reaching influence on health promotion policy and practice across the globe, benefitting the wellbeing of students, staff and wider campus communities”** \[A\]. 

 Dooris was opening keynote speaker at the influential *2015 International Health Promoting Universities and Colleges Conference*, with 375 participants from 33 countries spanning practice, policy and research. Insights from his research led to requests to distil findings into practitioner resources for use in other countries. For example, ‘The Eight Ps of Health Promoting Universities’ from an early research paper \[1\], for Healthy Minds, Healthy Campuses in Canada. A key conference outcome was the *Okanagan International Charter for Health Promoting Universities and Colleges* \[A\]. Strongly shaped by our research \[1, 2\], this offered a framework to guide and mobilise action and research; and issued calls for universities to embed health in campus culture and provide local and global health promotion leadership. To maximise the Charter’s impact, an International Health Promoting Universities and Colleges Network was set up in 2016 to support global adoption and implementation. This produced a policy\- and practice\-focused website profiling our research \[1,4\]. This has representation from 12 national/cross\-country networks, including, Asia, Canada, Germany, Ibero\-America, New Zealand and the UK \[B\]. Spanning more than 35 countries in five continents, these represent over 400 universities adopting the Healthy Universities approach. This shifted institutions from ad\-hoc interventions to a strategic systemic approach. This means that responses to student\- and staff\-related health challenges, such as mental ill\-health, no longer rely on free\-standing campaigns or projects, but co\-ordinate these with enhanced service provision. This includes curricular reconfiguration and health\-promoting campus design, thus embedding evidence\-informed programmes across the whole institution. Additionally, Dooris has been called on to share practice insights from our research \[1\-6\] with emerging initiatives and networks \(e.g. India, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Turkey\). In terms of significance and reach, the impact of this is evidenced in the USA: **“As Director of Health Promotion Strategy at the University of Southern California…I have been inspired by and drawn on Mark’s research...\[He\] has a global reputation and is seen as an international thought leader in…Healthy Settings and Health Promoting Universities. The conceptual and empirical research conducted by his team leads international thinking in these areas…\[and\] he has played a key role in facilitating theoretical constructs and research findings to be translated into practical actions with real\-world impact…I have been able to share this learning and begin to influence practice across the USA…Since his monumental contribution to the creation and initial adoption of The Okanagan Charter, Dr. Dooris’ work is spoken of in every conversation here in the States as pivotal to the future of Higher Education”** \[C\]. In a recent global study examining leadership for a whole university approach \[5\], Dooris and Farrier \(collaborating with Sue Powell, MMU\) illustrated the impact of their research by generating institutional case studies. Implementation at the University of Sydney \(70,000 students, 7,500 staff\), informed by our research, has used the Self\-Review Tool \[4\] to facilitate identification of priority areas for action. It has also built on work initiated by ‘champions’ to secure senior leaders’ commitment to Healthy Universities and align this with changing cultures and environments to advance student and staff wellbeing and performance. New activity with wide\-ranging buy\-in includes an online course for undergraduate students to learn about nutrition, physical activity, sleep, alcohol and drugs and mental wellbeing. The University of British Colombia \(65,000 students, 16,000 staff\), has pioneered Canadian action for Healthy Universities \[A\], a model informed by our research, demonstrating a whole organisation approach through a distributed leadership model. It has prioritised ‘health in all policies’, embedding the Okanagan Charter in its Frameworks for a Physically Active and Nutritionally Sound Campus, Green Building Plan and Mental Health and Resilience Framework. It is now drawing on the Okanagan Charter and Dooris’s wider research \[1\-6\] to guide evidence\-informed practice for student, staff and community health: **“The…research carried out by Mark and colleagues has pioneered an understanding and proposed early models of what a whole university approach can look like in the context of health promotion, helping to validate and inform approaches taken at…the University of British Columbia and across the Canadian Network”** \[A\]. Dooris’ research has also been implemented in the 2020 *National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework for Ireland* \[D\].  The reach of our research is also evidenced by Dooris delivering numerous invited keynotes at major policy and practice events, attracting thousands of high\-level decision\-makers concerned with real\-life application of learning.  For example: the 2019 IX Ibero\-American Health Promoting Universities Congress \(Mexico\), the 2019 2nd ASEAN Universities Network Health Promotion Conference \(Philippines\) and the 2018 NASPA Well\-Being and Health Promotion Leadership Conference \(Portland, Oregon\), attended by 1,300 people: **“Appreciating his trailblazing research…I proposed Mark as an opening panel member and keynote speaker…This ensured that a broad spectrum of professionals engaged mainly in service delivery and practice within universities and colleges across North America and beyond were able to benefit from the learning and insights that his research has generated”** \[C\]. 

 <ins> **National Level: Strategic Guidance and Expert Advice**</ins> 

 The research \[1\-6\] has made significant contributions to national strategy and guidance. As well as informing the Royal Society for Public Health’s Tackling Health Inequalities report, which highlighted the potential for healthy settings \(including universities\) approaches to improve health outcomes, Dooris’s research has influenced the widespread advocacy for and the adoption of whole university and whole system approaches to mental health. Universities UK’s 2015 *Student Mental Wellbeing in Higher Education*, widely used by HEIs to guide policy and practice, references Dooris \[1\] : **“The last decade has seen increased interest in a holistic ‘healthy settings’ approach… Pioneering work undertaken at the University of Central Lancashire \(Dooris 2001\) has stimulated developments and initiatives in other institutions across the sector”** \[E\]. Health Education England’s 2019 NHS Staff and Learners Mental Health Commission profiles our research \[4, 5\] and the contribution of Healthy Universities, noting: **“it is important that the development and provision of services takes place within a broader commitment to developing as a healthy and health enhancing organisation”** \[F\]. 

 Student Minds’ 2019 University Mental Health Charter references Dooris’s research \[3\] and acknowledges the role of the Healthy Universities model in calling **“for the sector to adopt a whole\-university approach to mental health”** \[G\]. Dooris has also contributed to the British Property Federation’s 2019 Student Wellbeing and Private Sector Student Accommodation guidance, which advocates a systemic approach. Dooris is an invited member of Universities UK’s Mental Health in Higher Education Advisory Group, which oversaw the formulation of the 2017 Stepchange Framework. Subsequently refreshed as Stepchange: Mentally Healthy Universities, this endorsed the approach and framework informed by Dooris and colleagues’ research, noting that: **“The development of a whole university approach to mental health is informed by…the Okanagan Charter for Health Promoting Universities and Colleges and the Healthy Universities framework”** \[H\]. Universities UK note that Dooris’s research has achieved significant impact through providing: **“an important conceptual frame for the StepChange approach’ and informing ‘the establishment and support of a significant community of practice across the UK sector to support implementation”** \[I\]. Supported by ministers and sector bodies, Stepchange was piloted by three HEIs \(UWE, Cardiff, York\) and adopted by many others as the basis for their own strategies \[I\]. It has also had significant international impact generating enquiries from Australia \(where it is informing a strategic framework\), New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, Norway, Ireland and the Netherlands \[I\]. Additionally, Dooris’s research has directly informed the whole\-of\-university Australian Framework for Promoting Student Wellbeing in Universities, which focuses on environments, services, awareness, knowledge and curricula. Most recently, in the context of COVID\-19, Dooris and colleagues’ research \[5\] is explicitly used to frame the wellbeing section of Advance\-HE’s *Capstone Report* for its Creating Socially Distanced Campuses and Education Project \[J\]. Dooris has also drawn on his research to deliver expert guidance across UK administrations. He has, with Sue Powell \(MMU\), organised three high\-level UK Healthy Universities Policy Summits in 2018/19, which profiled the University of Central Lancashire’s research \[1\-6\] with invited representation from Universities UK, NUS, Advance HE, public health agencies for England, Wales, Scotland and N. Ireland, Office for Students and funding councils for Wales and Scotland. These resulted in excellent feedback and commitments to strengthen collaboration within N. Ireland, Wales and Scotland, and initiate work across funding councils \[K\]. Dooris was an expert member of the Welsh Government taskforce developing the *Healthy and Sustainable Higher/Further Education Framework* \[K\]. Drawing extensively on our research \[1\-4\] and specifically the Self\-Review Tool \[4\], this calls on Welsh universities and colleges to develop and implement ‘whole university’ approaches to health, wellbeing and sustainability. This maps priority health issues against key organisational aspects. His research has also strongly informed the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales Well\-being and Health in Higher Education Policy Statement \[K\]. He was invited by the Public Health Agency for N. Ireland to address an inaugural Student Wellbeing Networking Event and meet with Queen’s and Ulster Universities to discuss adoption and practical implementation of the Healthy Universities model. This work focused on connecting student, staff and campus wellbeing agendas through integrated service provision, cultural change and healthy campus design: **“The research carried out by Mark and colleagues has been instrumental in spearheading Healthy Universities activity within Northern Ireland, helping to develop an understanding of and commitment to whole system approaches to health and wellbeing within the higher education sector…\[and\] in informing policy and investment within the public health system in Northern Ireland in the support of the wellbeing of our student population”** \[L\]. 

 <ins> **Institutional and Population Level: Adoption of the Healthy Universities Model**</ins> 

 The research has had far\-reaching influence on institutional practice, impacting on population health and wellbeing through adoption of the Healthy Universities approach set out in the Okanagan Charter by 86 UK HEIs. Case studies from recent research illustrate this \[5\]. At the 

 University of Central Lancashire \(23,000 students, 3,400 staff\) Dooris has championed Healthy Universities for 25 years, its initiative constantly being informed by underpinning research \[1\-6\]. Informed by use of the Self\-Review Tool \[4\], it is widely regarded as a beacon of good practice for its joined\-up whole institution approach. Its action plan spans priority areas such as food, mental health and physical environments and contributes to key corporate commitments, such as: teaching and learning, changing the culture and civic engagement, thereby enhancing student, staff and community health. It has developed a holistic approach to mental health across the university and produced guidance to ensure that capital projects maximise their positive impact on health and sustainability, for example, through natural light and nature\-connectedness. The University of the West of England \(30,000 students, 3,000 staff\) has championed a whole system perspective informed by our research, embedding health in all policies and processes and breaking down siloed working. It has secured executive\-level leadership, aligned its health and sustainability commitments, and engaged stakeholders across faculties, services, the Students’ Union and external bodies to develop whole university approaches to issues such as alcohol, drugs, sexual health and mental health. It has used the Self\-Review Tool to catalyse cross\-silo communication and facilitate reflective self\-assessment to enhance positive health impacts for students, staff and the wider community \[4\]. It has piloted Stepchange through its Mental Wealth initiative. The UK Healthy Universities Network, convened and co\-chaired by Dooris, is continually informed by the above research \[1\-6\] and plays a key role in supporting a growing number of HEIs \(86 UK; 27 non\-UK – up from 47 UK in 2008\) to apply the Healthy Universities approach. As of 30th November, there has been 55,409 unique visitors from 186 countries to the Healthy Universities website.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Collaborative research by the University of Nottingham and City, University of London on the effects of export subsidies on firm\-level and aggregate economic outcomes “ *achieved a direct impact in improving the technical assistance \[the World Bank\] provides \[B\]*” to the Dominican Republic. This research shows that generous fiscal incentives offered in special economic zones \(SEZ\) hinder the dynamism of firms operating outside these zones and have a large fiscal cost. The World Bank attests that this work “ *has made a very substantial contribution to identifying key challenges the Dominican Republic faces to become a high\-income country by 2030 \[B\]*”. The collaborative research has also been used by policymakers in the Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Supplies of Nepal to reform export subsidies with the aim of increasing their effectiveness in reducing the country’s trade deficit and fostering export diversification. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 While export subsidies are ubiquitous across the world, according to the World Trade Organization in the 2006 edition of its flagship publication, the World Trade Report, there are fewer empirical studies investigating them than almost any other instrument of commercial policy. Not only is available data on export subsidies scant and hard to find, but the fact that subsidies are often subject to a range of different eligibility requirements \(e.g. they are only available to firms located in specific geographical areas such as SEZ, exporting most of their output, or producing goods deemed to have potential to be sold in high\-income countries\) makes it extremely challenging to assess their impact on export performance and aggregate outcomes such as competitiveness and overall welfare. 

 The collaborative research led by Drs Riaño and Defever began whilst both were employed at the University of Nottingham, and continued after Dr Defever moved to City, University of London. In \[R1\] and \[R2\] Drs Riaño and Defever developed an analytic and quantitative framework to gauge how the imposition of export requirements on subsidies affects firm\-level export performance \(e.g. sales, number of firms exporting, and entry and exit into and out of foreign markets\), as well as aggregate outcomes such as competitiveness and aggregate welfare. Applying this methodology first to the case of China, their research shows that the use of export requirements provides a significant boost to exports, but at a high cost in terms of aggregate welfare. The rationale for this effect is that consumers in the enacting country face higher prices for the goods that are reoriented to the foreign market and at the same time have to pay for the provision of incentives through taxation; foreign consumers, on the other hand, reap the benefits of cheaper imports. 

 Following the presentation of \[R2\] at the 2014 World Bank’s Annual Conference in Development Economics, Drs Riaño and Defever were invited to participate in a technical assistance project requested by the Ministry of the Economy of the Dominican Republic to the World Bank’s Trade and Competitiveness \(T&C\) practice. The World Bank extended this invitation on the basis that “ *Dr Riaño is a world leader in his field of research and was considered the prime individual to undertake this work. \[B\]*” 

 The project’s objective was to carry out a rigorous evaluation of the impact of reforms undertaken between 2007 and 2011 that eliminated the requirement for firms located in SEZ to export at least 80% of their output. This policy change made Dominican SEZ compliant with WTO rules that prohibit the provision of subsidies—like the various tax concessions offered in SEZ—to be contingent upon export performance. \[R3\] showed that the reform did not have a significant impact on Dominican exports but made SEZ more attractive locations for firms to be based. The reason is that removing the export requirement opened the door for firms in SEZ to sell their output domestically without any restrictions while maintaining the fiscal incentives available to firms based in the zones. Since the subsidies offered in SEZ amount to almost 1% of GDP in terms of foregone tax revenue, the results in \[R3\] show that the reform had a substantial impact in the public finances of the Dominican Republic. As the World Bank’s country representative in the Dominican Republic notes in \[B\], “ *…the work by Dr Riaño and co\-authors shows that the efforts to make SEZ compliant with WTO rules did not go far enough in levelling the playing field between firms in SEZ and in the national customs territory and therefore did not contribute to reduce the extent of duality that had been identified in the Dominican export sector in the 2014 Diagnostic.*” 

 Following up from the work undertaken in the Dominican Republic, the World Bank’s T&C practice commissioned a new project from Drs Riaño and Defever in February 2016 at the behest of the National Planning Commission \(NPC\) of Nepal, the government’s apex policy advisory body, chaired by the Prime Minister. The objective of the project was to evaluate the impact of the Cash Incentive Scheme on Exports \(CISE\)—a cash subsidy granted to firms exporting a select group of 31 products to countries other than India \(which accounts for 70% of Nepal’s exports\). Based on these eligibility requirements, approximately two\-thirds of Nepalese exporters accounting for 40% of the country’s total exports stand to benefit from the subsidy. The objective of CISE is to boost Nepalese exports, curb the country’s chronic trade deficit and foster export diversification. \[R5\] shows that the CISE subsidy had a positive and significant impact on Nepalese exporters who received the subsidy inducing them to export new products and to reach new markets. The subsidy, however, did not produce a significant increase in the overall export sales per market of beneficiaries. The findings further showed that similar export promotion schemes offered by Bangladesh and India were more substantial. Thus, the research in \[R5\] indicates that there is scope for reforming CISE to increase the effectiveness to achieve its stated objectives.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The collaborative research led by Drs Riaño and Defever started at the University of Nottingham and has generated impact in two main ways: 

 **Informing the evidence base used by the World Bank to improve the technical assistance and development financing that contribute to the Dominican Republic’s sustainable development** 

 Between 2015 and 2016, Dr Riaño and co\-authors worked closely with the World Bank to inform them and key stakeholders of the findings in R3, which drew on the analytical and quantitative frameworks developed in R1 and R2. This included extensive discussions and presentations with different government entities such as the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Industry and the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic as well as the executive board of the National Council of Free Trade Zones. The research in \[R3\] and policy debate it produced was first used by the World Bank in its report \[R4\] on the role special economic zones \(SEZ\) should play to support a more inclusive economic growth model in the Dominican Republic. As attested by the World Bank *“The implications of the findings of Dr Riaño’s report \[R3\] are widespread, with significant economic impact. They were incorporated into a World Bank report published in November 2016 about the role SEZ should play to support a more inclusive economy growth model.”* \[B\] 

 World Bank Group staff in close consultation with national authorities and other stakeholders prepare Systematic Country Diagnostic reports, which incorporate a diagnostic exercise to identify key challenges and opportunities for a country to accelerate progress towards development objectives that are consistent with the goals of ending absolute poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. 

 Following the 2016 report, the collaborative research \[R3\] and subsequently \[R4\] directly informed the Systematic Country Diagnostic for the Dominican Republic published in June 2018 \[A\], as corroborated by a World Bank representative. “ *The Systematic Country Diagnostic prepared by the World Bank Group staff in close collaboration with the Dominican Authorities and other stakeholders published in June 2018 also incorporated the main results from the work undertook by Dr Riaño and co\-authors” \[B\]* 

 The Systematic Country Diagnostic \[A\] states \-\- based on the findings in \[R3\] and \[R4\] and forcefully corroborated in supportive statement \[B\] \-\- that the generous tax incentives provided in SEZ have created an uneven playing field which has hampered the competitiveness of local firms, hindered the development of linkages between exporters and domestic firms and put a strain on public finances.  Both a lack of inclusive growth among Dominican firms and the country’s inability to generate enough tax revenues were flagged as key challenges for the Dominican Republic to become a high\-income country by 2030. 

 The fact that the impact of tax incentives provided to SEZ was identified as having a direct effect on the growth and sustainability prospects of the Dominican Republic in the diagnostic will directly shape the World Bank’s provision of technical assistance and lending operations, including Development Policy Financing \(DPF\). DPF is the main financing instrument offered by the World Bank, which accounted for USD7,100,000,000 of worldwide commitments in 2018. Its purpose is to help countries achieve sustainable development through a program of policy and institutional actions by providing non\-earmarked general budget financing that is subject to the borrowing country’s implementation process. In order for the Dominican Republic to gain access to DPF directed towards private sector development initiatives – particularly those oriented to strengthen linkages with global value chains – it needs to provide concrete evidence to the World Bank Group’s board about its efforts to address the challenges raised in the diagnostic about its SEZ programme. Therefore, as \[B\] notes “ *… the work led by Dr Riaño is considered critical in potentially guiding policy reforms*” in the Dominican Republic. This collaborative research \[R1 – R4\] has therefore not only benefited officials at the World Bank in informing their economic policy making with Government officials, but will also have a longer\-term economic impact for businesses, employees and taxpayers in the Dominican Republic. 

 **Reforming export subsidies in Nepal to increase their effectiveness in reducing the country’s trade deficit and fostering export diversification** 

 Since 2012, there has been a spirited debate between the government and business stakeholders about the extent of support needed by Nepalese exporters to successfully compete in world markets and the form that this support should take. In 2016, \[R5\] was commissioned by Nepal’s National Planning Commission \(NPC\) to the Trade and Competitiveness practice at the World Bank as an input to evaluate the effectiveness and prospects of reform of the Cash Incentive Scheme on Exports \(CISE\) subsidy program – a pivotal instrument of export promotion in Nepal. The NPC is the Government’s apex policy advisory body, chaired by the Prime Minister. Members and Vice\-Chairs are ranked on par with Vice Ministers. 

 The government of Nepal concludes that CISE is fulfilling its objectives, based on the research findings that firms that received the subsidy began to export more products and to reach new foreign markets \[R5\]. The research \[R5\] also documents that both Bangladesh and India use export subsidies targeting specific products and destination markets, which are substantially more generous in terms of their subsidy rates than those provided by CISE. \(Bangladesh offers ad\-valorem subsidy rates as high as 30% on products like jute while India offers subsidies ranging from 2 to 5% to exports of more than 100 products.\) 

 The former Vice\-Chair for the National Planning Commission of Nepal, acknowledged the research findings \[R5\] and that the CISE subsidies had not been sufficiently high enough to encourage businesses to increase the scale of their exports. The Vice\-Chair used the research \[R5\] to advocate for reforming the CISE subsidy program to increase its effectiveness as stated below: *“While I was in Government, I advocated sharpening the incentives offered by CISE based on the findings of the evaluation carried out by Dr Riaño and colleagues. The Ministry of Finance has since increased the subsidy rates offered by the CISE program to improve the program’s effectiveness in raising exports and narrowing the trade deficit. \[D\].”* 

 The former Commerce Secretary of Nepal who oversaw the implementation of the CISE scheme, highlighted that the work conducted by Dr Riaño and co\-authors \[R5\] 

 *“has been a crucial point of reference providing inputs to this debate* \(about the effectiveness of the CISE scheme\)” and that *“The recommendations made by Dr. Riano and co\-authors to increase the level of cash incentives to increase their competitiveness by offsetting the higher cost of production and transit transportation was quite notable \[E\] ”.* 

 In addition, the limited impact of the subsidy on export sales identified in \[R5\] has been used by exporters to put pressure on the government to increase the level of cash incentives to make them competitive by offsetting the high costs of production and transportation they face in a landlocked country. The President of the Nepal Pashmina Industries Association, stated *“the incentive was very low compared to what neighbouring countries were giving to their traders.*\[F\]” The former Commerce Secretary noted that the research \[R5\] has *“helped to increase interaction and deliberations between industry and the government in order to boost competitiveness \[E\]”.* 

 In response, the Finance Minister raised the subsidy rate offered by the CISE scheme from 1 and 2% to an increase of 5% in the 2018/19 budget speech of May 2018. Businesses have welcomed the new provision, which has identified 26 exportable items that are eligible to receive the new cash incentives. The government’s spokesperson from the Ministry of Finance said the new provision is expected to check the country’s widening trade deficit. “ *It could also help the country earn more foreign currency at a time when the country is facing increasing pressure on its balance of payment due to excessive rise in import bills,”* adding that the Ministry has selected the goods based on their export statistics in the past few years. \[G\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Newcastle University research into formal modelling and design of asynchronous circuits and concurrent systems has laid the foundation to the development of industrial strength software “Workcraft”. Workcraft has been used by the microchip industry \(e.g., Dialog Semiconductor, Analog Devices\) to develop power\-management integrated circuits that are essential for saving electric energy and prolonging battery life in hundreds of millions of mobile devices around the world. 

 The design automation methodology that underpins Workcraft software improves productivity of electronic engineers from months to hours. Workcraft has also been used in training industry engineers and educating electronic engineering students.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Due to the widespread popularity of portable electronics such as mobile phones, there is an increasing demand for integrated circuits which are smaller, more complex, and yet cost\-effective. This has led to a rise in the use of Analogue and Mixed Signal \(AMS\) systems, in which both analogue and digital circuits co\-exist on a single chip. Increasingly, both analogue and digital parts are designed by the same team of engineers as it allows the overall AMS system to be holistically co\-optimized. AMS systems now play a vital role in monitoring a system's operating conditions, as well as distributing and regulating energy flows. However, AMS electronics is considered extremely hard to master, as the digital components must integrate seamlessly with the analogue parts, which are dynamic and notoriously hard to interface. 

 Newcastle University's longstanding research into the formal modelling of asynchronous and concurrent systems has inspired a new methodology for designing such systems, resulting in reduced inductor size and enhanced power conversion that responds to changes in demand more efficiently \[R1\-R4\].With energy becoming the most valuable resource in modern electronics, the responsiveness and robustness of power converters are crucial. Today’s chips make millions of control decisions every second, and a single mis\-step could cause malfunction or permanent damage. 

 The traditional approach to designing AMS control circuits relies on conventional synchronous components that require a clock frequency to be as high as 1 GHz, in order to meet the requirement of minimum latency of response, e.g. 1 nanosecond, to events generated by analogue components. This results in inefficient use of energy and a risk of failure. In contrast, using asynchronous logic for AMS control allows the system to operate at a pace that is determined by current operating conditions. AMS systems, however, need to keep evolving to track the advances in heterogeneous multi\-core systems architectures and of Internet of Things devices. 

 Newcastle University researchers tackled the issue of how to use asynchronous circuits as a control for analogue parts and as a front\-end for analogue\-to\-digital interfaces \[R1, R2\]. The methodology particularly draws on research into the use of Petri nets and causal representations of concurrent behaviour in electronic circuits \[R5\]. This has resulted in better power conversion efficiency, lower output ripple, faster response to analogue events, and reduced inductor size \[R3, R4\]. 

 Studies into the design of asynchronous VLSI circuits at Newcastle University date back to the 1990s, where Alex Yakovlev \(Lecturer/reader/professor of Computer Systems Design: 1991\- present\) developed the first formal model of the concurrent behaviour of such circuits Signal Transition Graphs \[R6\]. The research has since been carried out jointly with Maciej Koutny \(Lecturer/Reader/Professor\), Victor Khomenko \(Lecturer/EPSRC external research fellow/lecturer/senior lecturer/reader: 2003\-present\), Danil Sokolov \(Senior/Principal research associate\) and Andrey Mokhov \(Lecturer/Senior lecturer\) \[R1\]. 

 The resulting methodology has been implemented in several software tools \(such as Petrify, PUNF, MPSAT and PCOMP\), and in novel electronic components for interfacing analog and asynchronous parts \(WAIT, WAITX, SAMPLE\). It has also been integrated into a visual usable framework called Workcraft \[R1, R4\]. 

 Workcraft provides a flexible common framework for development of Interpreted Graph Models, including visual editing, \(co\-\)simulation, synthesis and formal verification. With Workcraft, the user can design a system using the most appropriate formalism \(or even different formalisms for the subsystems\), while still utilising the power of Petri net analysis techniques. The applications of the Workcraft framework are wide\-ranging: from modelling concurrent algorithms and biological systems to designing asynchronous electronic circuits and investigating crimes \(see workcraft.org\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Researchers from Newcastle University’s School of Engineering and School of Computing have developed new concepts, software and technologies that support the design and delivery of more reliable and efficient asynchronous systems. Their research has been incorporated into a visual toolset known as **Workcraft**. 

 Workcraft has been used by companies including electronic chip manufacturer Dialog Semiconductors, which paid for a bespoke version of the toolset to enhance the power conversion capabilities of its chips. Dialog’s principal client – Apple Corporation – invested US$600million in October 2018 to license some of Dialog’s power management technologies, acquire staff and assets, and support future research and development \[E3\]. 

 The Workcraft toolset is an open\-source project that is available publicly at workcraft.org. Additionally, after the initial stages of the R&D and impact creation in EPSRC project A4A \(2014\- 2017\), the project’s industrial partner Dialog Semiconductor supported R&D with their direct funding. Under this project besides open\-source software some novel bespoke functionality has been developed exclusively for Dialog Semiconductor. As a whole Workcraft was then used by the company to significantly enhance the power conversion capabilities of its chips. Dialog Semiconductor PLC is a multi\-national company which develops highly integrated mixed\-signal products for consumer electronics. It has approximately 1800 employees and offices in Europe, Asia and the USA \[E1\]. Its number one product is Power Management ICs. Its RapidCharge solutions for power adaptors boasted a 60% share of the rapid charge adapter market for smartphones at the end of 2017 \[E4\]. 

 The A4A project developed a novel design flow for the systematic development of asynchronous controllers for analogue\-mixed\-signal \(AMS\) systems, which has since been used in Dialog production chips \[E2\]. Newcastle University and Dialog co\-authored three papers in 2015 \[R2\], 2017 \[R1\] and 2019 \[R4\], demonstrating the advantages of asynchronous design methodology for AMS control. Simulation results indicated improved **reaction time, voltage ripple, peak current, and inductor losses, resulting in a higher efficiency of power conversion. These results meant that the size of coils could be reduced, a sizeable benefit for businesses such as mobile phone manufacturers, who see compact components and increased battery life and** **reliability as huge market drivers.** For example, it was reported at DATE 2017 \[R3, E2\] that for a 6μ load, an asynchronous control mentions peak current below 300mA using 1.8μH inductors. A synchronous control requires 10μH coils at 100MHz, 6.8μH at 333MHz, or 3.1μH at 666MHz \[E2\]. 

 Dialog extended its collaboration with Newcastle University following the end of the A4A project, providing an R&D project of over £500,000 to fund the further extension of Workcraft with new capabilities. Besides that, to date University has provided Workcraft tutorials to approximately 100 Dialog employees a year \(see: https://workcraft.org/training/start\). 

 In October 2018, Dialog announced that it had agreed a US$600million deal with Apple Corporation. The deal was the largest of its kind by Apple. Apple agreed to pay US$300million in cash to license certain power management technologies from Dialog, as well as to receive certain assets and over 300 employees to aid with chip research and development. The company also pre\-paid US$300million for Dialog products that would be delivered over the next three years. Dialog announced that it would continue to sell current and future generations of power management integrated circuits to Apple. Apple accounted for 75% of Dialog's total revenues this year, but the company expects that to drop to 35\-40% by 2022 \[E3\].In third quarter figures announced at the end of October 2018, Dialog announced record quarter revenue of US$384million, including a 3% year\-on\-year revenue rise in its Advanced Mixed Signal business. These results were collated before the Apple deal \[E4\]. In January 2019, it announced that its unaudited preliminary revenue for the full 2018 year was approximately US$1,442million \[E5\]. 

 Since 2017 a series of industrial track papers were produced in collaboration with Dialog Semiconductor for International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems \(ASYNC\). These papers are co\-authored with David Lloyd, who is a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Dialog Semiconductor. Being research papers, they have a strong practical focus on the design aspects that are especially relevant to industry \[E7, E8, E9\]. The latter for example, is aimed to help engineers to perform automatic verification of their asynchronous handshake circuits with a generic usage, going beyond power\-management circuits. 

 Notably, as a further illustration of the impact generated by Newcastle research, in December 2020, Danil Sokolov was hired as a full\-time employee by Dialog to continue integrating Workcraft into the company’s R&D process \(Sokolov is remaining a Visiting Fellow at Newcastle University\). 

 While Dialog is the main beneficiary of paid extensions to Workcraft functionality, a version of the toolset is available for free download. This makes advanced formal design techniques more accessible to industrial developers, rather than restricted to experts in the domain. Since 2014, there were 32 public releases of Workcraft that were downloaded 20K times from 4.7K unique IPs \(data sampled on 23.01.2021\). The availability of Workcraft attracts other companies and is increasingly featuring in the teachings of the future generation of engineers in this field. 

-  Other companies that have evaluated integration of Workcraft in their design flows, invested in training of engineers and, are able to use it in the design of products include: Analog Devices \(evaluated in 2018, last training in 2019\), Nordic Semiconductor \(since 2015, last training in 2019\) \[E10\]. 

-  Universities that use Workcraft toolset in the learning process: Newcastle University \(CSC3324, EEE8043, EEE8087, EEE8124\) \(see https://www.ncl.ac.uk/module\- catalogue\), Technical University of Denmark \(02204: \(http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/courses/02204\), Southampton University \(ELEC6233 \-  [https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/elec6233](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/elec6233)\)

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Lee and her colleagues have changed the lives of Children Born of War \(CBOW\) present and future by highlighting and addressing the significant challenges they face, shaping discourse and policy and mitigating against discrimination and stigmatisation. They have achieved demonstrable impact in three main areas: 

1.  **Initiated policy development and changes in practice** at an international level through sustained engagement with key stakeholders, such as the UN. 

1.  **Changed the self\-perception of CBOW** through participatory approaches and the co\-creation of cultural artefacts, enabling them to take ownership of their life stories. 

1.  **Empowered CBOW to challenge stigmatisation and discrimination** in their societies, including in Norway, Germany, Austria, Vietnam, Haiti, DRC and Uganda. CBOW have found a voice, raised awareness of the health, wellbeing and legal challenges they face and increased empathy, through inclusive processes and cultural artefacts. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Initiated by an AHRC Research Networking grant on Children Born of War \(CHIBOW\) \(2011\), Lee developed a series of international and interdisciplinary research collaborations, which enhanced the research source base and understanding of sexual exploitation and abuse \(SEA\) and gender\-based violence \(GBV\) in conflict and the experiences of CBOW \(conceived in both consensual and exploitative/abuse relationships\) in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Lee’s initial research focus on World War II expanded through the Initial Training Network \(ITN\) project she led \(2015–2019\), which constructed the first comprehensive comparative study of CBOW, covering armed conflicts, occupations and peacekeeping missions in four continents across the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. 

 The project created a new evidence base: culturally appropriate and ethically sensitive research methodologies were developed through interdisciplinary collaborations. Research with CHIBOW ITN partner Bartels led to the most extensive narrative data capture around peacekeeper\-fathered children to date \(including the first qualitative interview material with children aged six upwards\). \[RO1, RO2\] 

 As PI on a number of grants, Lee has worked collaboratively with scholars in Global Public Health \(Bartels\), socio\-legal studies \(Bunting\), anthropology \(Apio\) and psychology \(Glaesmer and Kaiser\) in conducting fieldwork. Utilising participatory research approaches has shaped Lee’s work deeply and has informed the data and analysis. Findings arising from this extensive research include: 

 **RF1\)** Enhanced understanding of the historically contextualised life\-courses of CBOW conceived in conflicts across Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, including specific analyses of childhood adversities, human rights challenges, economic and psychosocial disadvantages, and physical and mental health challenges. \[RO3, RO5, RO6\] 

 **RF2\)** Historically and culturally sensitive comparative analysis of CBOW experiences resulted in a more nuanced understanding of the specificities of CBOW experiences as well as identifying patterns of such experiences independent of geopolitical and historical contexts. 

 **RF3\)** Historical\-anthropological insights into the impact of kinship and patriarchal social structures on the integration of CBOW and their mothers into fragile post\-conflict societies have resulted in better understanding of how specific cultural norms, customary laws around marriage laws, bride wealth and lineage making, as well as implementation of inheritance laws, lead to inequalities of social, educational and economic opportunities. This led to new insights into barriers to integration for enemy\-fathered children and their mothers into fragile post\-conflict societies. \[RO3\] 

 **RF4\)** The first conceptualisation of CBOW rights as part of the human rights and child rights discourse led to a substantially enhanced understanding of the rights\-based approaches on which support and assistance for victims and survivors of SEA and GBV is now based. 

  

 The research has thus improved definitional clarity and contributed to a genuinely comparative analysis of CBOW experiences across time and space.

1.  **Initiated policy development and changes in practice within international organisations and nation states** 

 **Policy development at the United Nations \(UN\)** was affected by raising awareness of the CBOW and the absence of mechanisms to support them emotionally, socially and legally. **Better UN support mechanisms were introduced** as a result of Lee engaging with UN personnel across different offices and departments, highlighting the particular needs of CBOW. This included the inclusion of a rights\-based approach to victim support \(UNSCR2467\) and the appointment of a Victims Rights Advocate in August 2017 as a champion, among others, of the support and assistance of children born of conflict\-related sexual exploitation and abuse. 

 **Multiple policy audiences and the UN were further engaged through a multi\-layered sustainable media strategy**, starting in 2014, in multiple languages and countries, targeting platforms such as BBC, ORF, MDR, GEO, *Times*, *NYT*, *Libération*, CNN and GI \(the biggest online platform in Brazil\). For example, in 2019, the first large\-scale historically contextualised analysis of community perceptions of UN Peacekeeping and CBOW was read over 120,000 times in the first month and was picked up across different international outlets, increasing the visibility of the topic among policy makers. In response, the UN Victims’ Rights Advocate and the Assistant Secretary General for Human Resources contacted Lee and Bartels and asked them to collaborate on improving reporting structures around SEA and GVB by peacekeepers and thus to provide more effective victim support. \[S1\] Similarly, the analysis also directly led to policy development and action in Chile on the issue of CBOW. In January 2020, the Chilean Congress approved the creation of a commission to investigate cases of abuse in Haiti. The CNN Chile news anchor stated that, ‘the research has been very relevant’ to the establishment of the Commission. \[S3\] 

  

 Examples of further impact at the international level are: 

-  **Informed, supported and changed the UN’s data collection process**: CBOW data has been used in the annual report of the UNSRSG for Sexual Violence in Conflict every year since 2015. \[RO2, RO4; S1\] Since 2014, Lee has fed research insights \[RF1, RF2, RF3\] into central and in\-country offices within the UN, including the Office for UNSRSG Sexual Violence in Conflict, who attested that Lee ‘was the person who got us to start focusing on the issue,’ as well as the Victims’ Rights Advocate and the in\-country UN Women Protection Gender Advisor. \[S1\] 

-  **Raised awareness and shifted policy on CBOW issues on the UN Security Council \(UNSC\)**: Evidenced by the inclusion of matters relating to CBOW, as distinctive concerns since 2015, on various UNSCR’s on Women, Peace and Security \(WPS\), most recently in UNSCR2467. Additionally, under the supervision of Lee, Apio’s work was instrumental in CBOW issues being placed on the agenda of the UN Security Council in March 2015. Apio’s invited presentation at the Open Debate of the Security Council raised the profile of the issue and directly informed the SC debates. \[S2\] In response, the UN Security Council President asserted that ‘we must recognise that reintegration is a long\-term effort that requires the collective responsibility of all stakeholders, including the international community’. \[S2\] 

-  **Improved practices and training at the UN** by shaping new training and directly influencing UN practitioners. In response to a parallel study on peacekeeper\-fathered children in the DRC and Haiti \[RO1\], the UN invited Lee to contribute to its ongoing \(2018–present\) critical evaluation of UN peacekeeping training. Their input revealed inadequate coverage of culturally contingent CBOW issues and led to a reconsideration of best practice in training. \[S1\] Lee and Bartels are currently working with UN Women Protection Gender Advisor to update training guidance. The pilot, which was planned to take place summer 2020, has been postponed until summer 2021 due to Covid\-19. 

1.  **Changed self\-perception of CBOW through participatory approaches and the co\-creation of cultural artefacts, enabling them to take ownership of their life stories** 

 The research has **significantly shifted self\-perception within the CBOW community** through active inclusion in the research \(RO2, RO3, RO4\). Participatory approaches directly engaged with target communities in Norway, Germany, Austria, Vietnam, Haiti, DRC and Uganda. CBOW used engagement in research to process psychosocial challenges and create space for new self\-perception. A 2015 GEO article on *Russenkinder* recorded how some CBOW participants in Germany reported a sense of ‘normality \[…\] replacing shame and shyness’ **,** leading some to claim that they now feel ‘proud’ of their biological origin, ‘felt esteem’ and ‘now have a voice.’ \[S4; S5\] Similarly, participants in the Ugandan chapter spoke of how ‘drastically, I feel my life changed’ reported feeling ‘safer’, ‘proud of who I am’ with a ‘reduction in the level of stress and trauma’ and that the project ‘rebuilt my hope for the future and has built a process of healing’, in stark contrast with former feelings of ‘misfortune that I was born,’ of feeling ‘desperate’ ‘miserable’ and ‘fearful’ in a life ‘full of hatred, stigmatization and rejection’. \[S11\] 

 **New cultural artefacts allowed CBOW to reconstruct identities**. Supported by Lee’s historical contextualisation of their life\-courses \(RO3, RO4, RO6\), CBOW have written biographical and autobiographical pieces, which have further changed their self\-perception, resulting in ‘new self\-confidence’ and ‘a voice in society that they hitherto had not had \[…\] we no longer feel marginalised’. \[S7\] The German Foreign Ministry facilitated the translation of a CBOW’s book into Bosnian, which further supported the public discourse on the topic of CBOW in former Yugoslavia. The value of collaboration between academic partners and CBOW support groups was specifically mentioned in awarding the *Bundesverdienstkreuz* \(German order of merit\) to one of the participants in 2017 \[S8\]. 

1.  **Empowered CBOW to challenge stigmatisation and discrimination** **in their societies and beyond, and increased empathy through inclusive processes and cultural artefacts** 

 **New support groups \( **Distelblüten**, the Bosnian ‘Association of Forgotten Children of War’\) were established and new foci for activities were found** as a result of CBOW’s active inclusion in research processes \(RO3, RO4\) and the creation of a significant evidence base. Established in response to a CBOW 2015 symposium, for example, since 2018, the Association of Forgotten Children of War has specifically focused on raising public awareness. \[S6\] In 2019, the President of the Association of Forgotten Children of War gave her own speech in the UN chamber as part of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, only a fortnight after two other representatives of the Forgotten Children of War Association spoke at the United Nations at an event of the UNSRSG on Sexual Violence in Conflict. 

 The research has **further increased the international visibility of CBOW** through the creation of new, participatory cultural artefacts. Lee collaborated with award\-winning artistic director Darrel Toulon in the production of a new cultural artefact, the docu\-dance ‘In the Name of the Father’. The performance was choreographed using the interviews with CBOW, some of whom, together with professional actors and dancers, participated in the performance. The President of the Association of the Forgotten Children of War noted that, ‘I felt a tremendous relief when I told my story in front of a full theatre. This show made us visible.’ \[S9\] In December 2019, the production played to full houses at the National Theatre, Tuzla and the Theatre of War, Sarajevo, and it was scheduled for international showings in 2020. The ‘Bosnian chapter’ of ‘In the Name of the Father’, has been supplemented by a ‘Ugandan chapter’, which premiered a performance at Aboke in January 2020 and was set to complete further regional performances in April/May 2020. The psychologist working with the Ugandan participants stated that before the project began participants had ‘trust issues with each other and the trainers’ but that, by the end of the project, participants ‘were socializing more with each other, creating friendships’ and ‘trusting more, opening their walls which they had guarded because of the stigma.’ Some participants actually found siblings amongst the group. Participants were ‘given a platform’ to ‘express their voices’ and were able to ‘advocate for their rights through the medium of art.’ \[S10\] 

 The research has **promoted higher levels of empathy and understanding for CBOW** through new cultural artefacts: Lee’s collaborative research \[RO5\] on the life\-courses of Lebensborn children directly informed the development and production of a BAFTA\-winning mobile game/app. ‘My Child Lebensborn’ is a virtual story\-driven nurture game, which promotes awareness of and empathy for CBOW amongst younger audiences. It is currently rated 4.8 out of 5 on Apple and GooglePlay respectively, based on more than 2,800 reviews, and rated 9.9 of 10 on tap tap. It has been reviewed widely and positively in the press, with the *Guardian* \(9 June 2018\) review praising it as: ‘uniquely effective’ in bringing ‘to vivid life the emotional texture of history’. It was featured among the ‘Best video games of 2018’ in *The New Yorker* \(Simon Parkin, 29 November 2019\) and won the 2019 BAFTA for best ‘Game Beyond Entertainment’.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Six months of post\-operative chemotherapy with an oxaliplatin\-containing therapy had been the current standard treatment for stage III colorectal cancer \(CRC\). Although effective, this treatment caused considerable and durable side effects, reducing patient quality of life. The SCOT trial, initiated and led by UofG, was the largest contributor to research showing that three months is as effective as six months of treatment, preserving treatment outcomes while significantly reducing side effects. The change in practice saves an estimated GBP42 million in healthcare costs over two years in the UK NHS alone. Since 2018, these findings form the basis of recommendations in leading international clinical guidelines, changing practice among 99% of UK clinicians. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Over 40,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer \(CRC\) in the UK each year, and 1.8 million globally. Since 2004, the standard of care had been surgery, followed by 6 months of chemotherapeutic treatment with an oxaliplatin\-containing regimen for patients with stage III CRC. However, while of proven benefit, these therapies can cause cumulative dose\- and duration\-dependent peripheral nerve damage, which can cause permanent numbness, loss of function and pain. 

 One way to potentially address the toxicity and cost of these therapies is to halve treatment duration to 3 months, but it was unclear whether this might compromise treatment efficacy. In 2007, Prof. Jim Cassidy and Jim Paul conceived and initiated the Short Course Oncology Treatment \(SCOT\) study to address this question, with Prof. Andrew Briggs leading a health\-economic study component to provide robust evidence on the cost\-effectiveness of reducing the duration of adjuvant therapy \(little investigated at the time\) and the impact on toxicity. UofG researchers were ideally placed given the expertise of the UofG’s Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit \(CTU\) and UofG’s pivotal role in establishing a leading oxaliplatin regimen \(CAPOX, also known as XELOX, a doublet therapy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin\) as a first\-line treatment for metastatic CRC, which was the subject of a  [REF2014 case study](https://impact.ref.ac.uk/casestudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=40439). The UofG led and sponsored the international SCOT trial via the CTU, which comprises statisticians, trial managers, medical and IT staff, who contributed to the trial’s design and protocols, co\-ordinated international recruitment, undertook all randomisation processes and data collection for all patients, conducted analyses and pharmacovigilance, and interpreted the clinical outcome data \[3.1\]. 

 **The innovative SCOT study** 

 SCOT was an independent, international, randomised, phase 3 trial, with embedded health economic analysis, to establish whether a three\-month oxaliplatin\-based regimen \(either CAPOX or FOLFOX—5\-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin\) is non\-inferior to a six\-month regimen, with respect to disease\-free survival in patients with CRC. Having secured a GBP2.7 million grant to UofG from the Medical Research Council \(PI: Cassidy, 2007–2010\), the trial recruited 6,088 patients in 244 centres \(UK, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand\) between 2008 and 2013, who had high\-risk stage II or stage III colon or rectal cancer and were followed up for 5\-year disease\-free survival and overall survival. SCOT is the largest randomized study to date investigating short course adjuvant therapy for CRC. Published in April 2018, SCOT showed that 3 months of treatment was non\-inferior to 6 months, with no detrimental impact on patient survival, and with substantially less neuropathy \(both acute and long\-term\) \[3.2\]. The accompanying health economic analysis showed that the 3\-month was less costly than the 6\-month regimen, saving the NHS GBP4,881 per patient per year, with no significant detriment to quality\-of\-life years \(QALY\) \[3.3\], and highlighting that a 3\-month treatment strategy should be considered a new standard of care. 

 **SCOT contributes to international meta\-analysis** 

 In parallel to SCOT, the IDEA collaboration was set up as a prospective, pre\-planned, pooled analysis of six, phase\-3 trials worldwide, to address the short course question. IDEA focussed on stage III colon cancer only, across two adjuvant regimens \(CAPOX and FOLFOX\). While SCOT was designed as a stand\-alone international study, Prof. Cassidy agreed to contribute data from SCOT to the IDEA analysis. Thereafter, Cassidy \(until 2011\) and Paul \(throughout\) were IDEA steering committee members. SCOT contributed 3,893 stage III colon cancer patients to the total 12,834 patients in the main IDEA analysis—the largest contribution from any single trial. Across the entire population of patients, IDEA confirmed the non\-inferiority of a shorter course of CAPOX, but not of FOLFOX. However, an exploratory analysis combining both regimens within newly established risk subgroups, low risk \(patients with T1–3/N1 disease\) and high\-risk \(patients with T4/N2 disease\), confirmed the shorter courses to be non\-inferior in the low\-risk group; whereas for the high\-risk patient sub\-group, 6 months was superior. IDEA thus concluded that 3 months of treatment with CAPOX was as effective as 6 months with regard to 3\-year, disease\-free survival \(particularly in low\-risk patients\) and offered a significant three\-fold reduction in neuropathy \[3.4\]. SCOT was the only trial \(out of six\) which recruited patients with rectal cancer. Rectal cancer patients are often under\-represented in adjuvant trials and their management is more complex because pre\-operative treatment such as radiotherapy/chemotherapy are often given. SCOT suggested that clinical practice for rectal cancer patients who hadn’t received pre\-operative chemotherapy or long\-course chemoradiation need not differ from patients with stage III colon cancer \[3.2\]. 

 In a further prospective, pre\-planned sub\-group analysis, which ran parallel to the IDEA study, the IDEA steering group investigated whether 3 months of CAPOX was non\-inferior to 6 months’ treatment in high\-risk stage II CRC patients. This study pooled data from 3,273 stage II colon cancer patients from SCOT and three other IDEA studies that included stage II patients. In this more heterogenous group, significantly less grade 3–5 toxicity occurred following 3 months of treatment, although with a reduction in 5\-year, disease\-free progression compared to 6 months of treatment \(80.7% v 83.9%, respectively\) \[3.5\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The SCOT and the IDEA trials have been highlighted through international guidelines and within the professional community as a landmark moment for oncologists and their patients. The studies demonstrated the effectiveness of 3 months of adjuvant chemotherapy for some patients with CRC \(with reduced side effects\) and the economic benefits of a shorter regimen. The clinical findings reported by these trials have led to a new global standard for most patients who are suitable to treat with CAPOX, particularly those with low\-risk stage 3 disease; this new standard balances the efficacy of a chemotherapy regimen with toxicity and quality of life, depending on patients’ tolerance and attitude to their disease. 

 **Dissemination and discussion in the clinical community** 

 In 2017, the SCOT and IDEA trial results were presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology \(ASCO\) conference, a leading forum for oncologists worldwide consisting of 35,000 medical professionals, and at the 2017 European Society for Medical Oncology \(ESMO\) congress, which brings together over 15,000 medical professionals. At ESMO, a Special Session debate brought together the SCOT and IDEA trial leads with external experts and a clinical audience to clarify the potential impact of these results on clinical practice and to achieve a more meaningful interpretation of the results. The panel agreed on the value of CAPOX for 3 versus 6 months in low\-risk stage III patients, given the increased quality of life \[5.A\]. Given that 92% of oncologists in a recent survey identified conferences as a key influence in their practice, the presentation of the SCOT and IDEA trial findings at these conferences likely stimulated discussion and considerations of practice within the CRC community \[5.B\]. An important and unanticipated piece of knowledge generated from post\-hoc studies within both SCOT and IDEA is stage III risk stratification \(into ‘low’ and ‘high’\) which didn’t exist before. Many clinicians have adopted this risk stratification into their practice \[5.B\]. 

 **Impact on clinical guidelines now reflect a short\-course treatment option** 

 Updates to the preeminent clinical guidelines used by UK and international clinicians provide new options for treating low\- and high\-risk stage III CRC. We know that from a recent survey of this clinical community that 87% of clinicians treating CRC patients in the adjuvant setting use guidelines to inform treatment decisions, citing ESMO, ASCO, NCCN and NICE as preeminent in this regard \[5.B\]. 

-  In September 2019, **ESMO** issued an eUpdate to their 2013 early colon cancer guidelines, citing IDEA data to recommend that duration of oxaliplatin\-based adjuvant treatment for stage III colon cancer may be tailored to 3 months for CAPOX \(for patients with low risk T1–3 N1 disease\), level II B \[5.C\]. They also recommended, for the first time, that oncologists consider using a 3\-month CAPOX regimen for high\-risk, stage II colon cancer, based on the pre\-planned sub\-group analysis of IDEA data that drew heavily from SCOT trial data \[3.5\]. This is an important consideration given the benefits that oxaliplatin therapy can have for patients with high\-risk stage II CRC, and addresses uncertainty among oncologists—25% of survey respondents were unsure whether 3\-month CAPOX could be considered. 

-  In June 2019, **ASCO** published a clinical practice guideline to specifically address the duration of oxaliplatin\-containing adjuvant therapy \[5.D\]. This guideline offers three recommendations: 1\) that high\-risk \(T4 and/or N2\) stage III CRC patients are offered a 6\-month therapy; 2\) that low\-risk patients \(those with T1\-3 and N1 stage tumours\) are given a choice of 3\-month or 6\-month therapy; and 3\) that a shared decision\-making approach with patients should be used that reflects patient characteristics and preferences, and the risks and benefits of treatment duration. 

-  In 2018, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network \( **NCCN**\) —a consortium of 23 US centres of clinical excellence in cancer care— updated its colon cancer guidelines to recommend that the preferred treatment for low\-risk stage III CRC include CAPOX for 3 months or FOLFOX for 3–6 months; and for high\-risk CRC, CAPOX \(3–6 months\) or FOLFOX \(6 months\) \[5.E\]. 

-  In January 2020, **NICE** published a new guideline \(NG151 Colorectal cancer\) that specifically addressed the optimal duration of adjuvant chemotherapy for CRC \[5.F\]. Drawing on the SCOT and IDEA trials, the committee recommended 3 months of CAPOX chemotherapy for both low\- and high\-risk CRC patients. The review concluded there was strong cost\-effectiveness evidence to support the recommendation, citing the UofG study \[3.3\] as being directly applicable and of high quality. NICE also recommended FOLFOX for 3 to 6 months, with duration determined through individual consultation with those patients not suitable for 3 months of CAPOX, taking into account the benefits and short\- and long\-term harms of each option. On the basis of the SCOT trial, which was the only study to recruit a significant number of patients with rectal cancer, the committee also extended these recommendations to those rectal cancer patients who had not received preoperative, long\-course chemotherapy. 

 **Impact on clinical practice** 

 Around 64% of all stage\-III CRC patients are eligible for chemotherapy. In the UK, this equates to \~6,300 patients, with an equal split between low\-risk \(T1–3/N1\) and high\-risk \(T4/N2\) disease. In April 2019, 95% of international clinicians and 99% of UK clinicians who provide adjuvant doublet chemotherapy to CRC patients reported being aware of clinical trials on optimising chemotherapy duration in this setting, citing either SCOT \(more common in UK\) or IDEA. Around 92% self\-reported changing their practice in line with these studies’ findings, with 98% of these clinicians doing so specifically when treating ‘low risk’ stage III disease \[5.B\]. Of UK clinicians surveyed \(n=141\), 92% treat patients with rectal cancer and 58% use the same treatment strategy as for CRC \[5.B\]. Practice change is also evident within the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Care Centre, which serves 60% of Scotland’s population. The proportion of patients within this region receiving <ins>more than</ins> 3 months of CAPOX treatment decreased substantially since the SCOT trial results were reported \(from 84% pre\-SCOT to 20% post\-SCOT\) with a clear change in trend from June 2017 onwards, reflecting rapid translation of trial evidence into practice \[5.G\]. This change to a 3\-month treatment duration is also apparent in prescribing data from across Scotland \[5.G\]. 

 The National Cancer Research Institute \(NCRI\) Colorectal Cancer Clinical Studies Group \(CRC\-CSG\) comprises senior clinicians and patient representatives with a broad overview of UK practice in CRC. They stated, ‘ *there has been a nationwide shift in prescribing a shorter duration of adjuvant doublet chemotherapy \(CAPOX\) for patients with low\-risk stage III colon cancer. Using a shorter duration of treatment \(3 months versus 6 months\) for these patients has also had an immediate capacity impact at oncology outpatient departments and chemotherapy units across the UK, allowing appointments and chair time to be made available for treatment of other patients. For those patients with colorectal cancer who receive a shorter duration of treatment, a reduction in toxicity, especially peripheral neurotoxicity, has already been seen*’ \[5.H\]. The CRC\-CSG also acknowledged that, ‘ *a shorter duration of doublet treatment \(CAPOX\) will likely be included as a new standard treatment for many patients receiving adjuvant treatment for CRC in future trials*’. A reduction in toxicity also makes it possible to include additional combination therapies \(e.g. immunotherapies\) concurrently, increasing their curative potential \[5.H\]. 

 **Impact on patient quality of life** 

 Neuropathy is the primary, long\-term adverse effect of chemotherapy that has a significant negative impact on patients’ lives. However, peripheral sensory neuropathy is measurably reduced in patients receiving a shorter duration of treatment. In the UK, if \~3,630 patients per year agreed to a 3\-month treatment regimen for stage III disease, 1,198 fewer patients are likely to experience grade 2 \(moderate\) or more severe neuropathy. These levels of neuropathy impede daily life \(preparing meals, shopping, managing money\) and work, and can persist for up to 5 years. A shorter course of chemotherapy also means less diarrhoea \(a 40% reduced incidence has been reported in a 3\-month therapy population \[3.2\]\), as well as a lower incidence of fatigue, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea and hand\-foot syndrome, fewer doctor appointments, blood draws and less time away from work/social interactions. 

 **Impacts on healthcare and societal costs** 

 The treatment costs accrued during the first year of a CRC diagnosis are greater than those accrued for other common cancers, such as breast, lung, and prostate. The total economic burden of CRC in the USA alone is estimated to be around  [USD39 billion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139918/). A shorter treatment duration will, on average, halve drug costs, as well as reducing administrative costs and the costs of treating adverse effects. The estimated costs saved in the UK ultimately depend on treatment choice, but the UofG health economic analysis put NHS cost savings at GBP4,881 per patient per year \(or GBP3,853 for CAPOX and GBP6,481 for FOLFOX, with two\-thirds of patients treated with CAPOX\) \[3.3\]. A budget impact analysis calculated NHS savings over two years at GBP42 million \[5.I\]. This assumes that 64% stage III CRC patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy and 55% practice change across the whole stage III population who get chemotherapy. The budget impact analysis over a 5\-year basis performed for SCOT\-participant countries amounts to savings of around USD151 million: Australia \(USD25 million\), Denmark \(USD7 million\), New Zealand \(USD4 million\), Spain \(USD44 million\), Sweden \(USD10 million\) and UK \(USD61 million\) \[5.I\]. Furthermore, there are substantial potential savings in societal costs—defined as productivity loss from time away from work during chemotherapy treatment in patients of working age, plus the travel costs incurred by patients. During year 1 of treatment, extended over a 5\-year basis, societal savings are nearly equal to the healthcare savings \[5.I\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Global maternal and newborn mortality remains unacceptably high despite substantial efforts, with 50% of maternal deaths and over 60% of neonatal deaths linked to poor quality care. This research showed for the first time that midwifery is an essential intervention that can substantively improve survival, health, and well\-being in low\-, middle\-, and high\-income countries. The innovative methods brought clarity and evidence to the contentious policy debate about the contribution of midwifery to quality care. The findings transformed professional, academic, and public understanding of midwifery, changing global and national policy and standards for service provision, regulation, education, and workforce. The research enabled non\-governmental organisations to advocate for midwifery and resulted in governments mandating implementation of international\-standard midwifery. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The aim of this research programme was to inform global policy by investigating the impact of midwifery. The impetus was concern about high rates of maternal and newborn mortality and stillbirth and concern about the quality of maternal and newborn care globally. Midwifery was often represented as contentious with a weak evidence base, limiting the information available to decision\-makers. 

  

 The first stage of this programme \(2011\-2016\) produced three research papers and a call to action published as The Lancet Series on Midwifery \(2014\), with a fifth paper on global research priorities published in Lancet Global Health \(2016\). Renfrew was Principal Investigator and Steering Group Chair for the programme, McFadden was collaborator. Collaborators included forty\-five interdisciplinary researchers from five continents with backgrounds including midwifery, obstetrics, paediatrics, epidemiology, health economics, social and political science; and organisations including WHO and the International Confederation of Midwives \(ICM\). Ten leading multidisciplinary researchers and professionals acted as critical readers for all outputs. 

 This submission describes impact of the first output **\[R1\]** of this research programme; designed and led by Renfrew, co\-authored by McFadden, with eleven other co\-authors from low\-, middle\- and high\-income countries, **R1** provided the formative evidence base and conceptual foundation for subsequent programme outputs. The methodological challenge addressed was the scarcity of evidence on midwifery, resulting from longstanding under\-investment and its inconsistent implementation. The innovative design was a multi\-stage mixed\-methods critical synthesis of existing and new evidence and expert consensus. It enabled three key questions to be answered for the first time: 

 *What are the components of midwifery that matter to women and babies?* Analyses of 13 meta\-syntheses of 229 studies of the views and experiences of women and midwives, and three national case studies of countries without midwives, were conducted. An iterative process\-built consensus was reached on the analysis and interpretation of this evidence among co\-authors, and the other 32 researchers, global agencies, and ten critical readers involved in the programme. This formed the evidence base for a new definition of midwifery and an innovative framework for quality maternal and newborn care, the Quality Maternal and Newborn Care \(QMNC\) Framework. It resulted in a rigorous, transparent, consistent conceptual basis for further work and enabled the systematic identification of all components within the scope of midwifery. 

 *What is the impact of midwifery on outcomes?* The impact of each individual component in the scope of midwifery was identified by re\-examining 461 systematic reviews incorporating thousands of studies. This process identified 56 outcomes improved by the 72 effective practices identified as within the scope of midwifery, including: reductions in maternal and newborn mortality, stillbirth, pre\-term birth, interventions in childbirth, maternal morbidity, pain, anxiety, depression; increases in breastfeeding, immunisation, contraceptive use; improvements in mother\-baby interaction and women’s experiences; and reduced use of health service resource. 

 *Who should best provide midwifery care?* Analysis of 10 reviews \(reporting 124 studies\), showed that midwives who are educated and trained to ICM international standards and integrated into the health system optimise all 56 of the outcomes identified, evidencing the key contribution of midwives for the first time.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Over 60% of neonatal deaths and 50% of maternal deaths arise from poor quality care **\[E3\]**. This research was the first to evidence midwifery as an essential intervention to improve survival, health and well\-being for women and newborn infants, bringing clarity to the policy debate about the contribution of midwifery to quality care. The conceptual and theoretical developments and evidence have influenced global and national decision\-makers, forming the rationale for transformative structural change to such an extent that the language and concepts have seeped into common use in low\-, middle, and high\-income countries as confirmed by the Technical Advisor, Midwifery in the WHO **\[E1\]**: ‘ *Globally it* \[R1\] *has changed the language that we use in talking about midwifery… it has become embedded into major global structures and right down to country level’*. 

 The reaction was swift across all regions and all fields necessary for large\-scale, sustainable change: policy, guidance, education, regulation, advocacy and funding, with consequent direct impacts on quality of care. 

 Policy and guidance 

 Governments and health services in every continent have acted on the findings to strengthen midwifery, with direct impact on quality of care delivered to women and newborn infants in multiple countries **\[E1, E7\]**. The findings informed WHO and ICM guidance and standards on quality of care and strengthening midwifery **\[E2\]**, becoming *‘embedded into WHO global documents’* **\[E1\]** and providing the core evidence for the transformative global WHO\-UNFPA\-ICM\-UNICEF ‘Framework for Action for strengthening quality midwifery education for Universal Health Coverage’ **\[E3\]**, used by governments and health services to strengthen midwifery education worldwide. 

 Citing **R1** evidence as key, the Indian Government launched a programme of work in 2018 for education and regulation of professional midwives enabling all women in India \(population 1.3 billion\) to access midwives. This marked the first ever national strategy for midwifery and midwives in India, acknowledged by health ministers to be *‘a historic moment for Midwifery in the Country*´ and ‘ *a landmark policy decision’* **\[E4\]**. The WHO Technical Advisor describes the policy shift as a radical change in the model of care and notes similar impacts ‘ *spilling out*’ into multiple African countries, across the 11 WHO South\-East Asia Region \(SEARO\) nations, and beyond **\[E1\]**. 

 Education and regulation 

 The research evidence and QMNC Framework formed the foundation for the UK Nursing and Midwifery Council’s transformative regulatory standards for midwives **\[E5\]**. Mandatory until their revision in 2030, these standards are the basis for the education of all UK midwifery students \(around 10,000 per year\), with ongoing impact on the care they will continue to provide throughout their careers for around 600,000 women, babies and families annually, directly improving the care of millions of women and babies. These standards form the benchmark for the quality of all midwifery care in the UK. 

 Globally, the research is being used by regulators and educators to inform standards, and to improve quality both of care and of midwifery training. The research has influenced the *‘revision of the Required Competences for Registered Midwives in Sweden’* **\[E6\]** and has *‘informed establishment of an Interim Nursing and Midwifery Council to regulate the professions in South Sudan’* **\[E7\]**. In Malawi, education policy for midwifery has changed, leading to direct entry for midwifery at bachelor’s level **\[E12\]**. 

 Across Latin American and Caribbean countries, the QMNC Framework ‘ *has been a fundamental base to… the development of Competency Based Education… through the region’* benefitting 20 instructors, 177 lecturers and 4080 trained in maternal health **\[E8\]**. In Bangladesh, where the midwifery profession is new, targeted initiatives with UNFPA partners are extending the quality and reach of midwifery education for ‘ *38 educational institutions and 150 midwifery faculty and… around 400 students per year’* **\[E6\]**. This impact continues to grow; the new WHO interprofessional Midwifery Education Toolkit for maternal, newborn, sexual, reproductive and mental health integrates **R1** throughout, and will be distributed to all member states in five languages: ‘ *the new WHO Academy has accepted this as one of its first 10 educational courses*… *to be launched… in May 2021’* **\[E1\]**. 

 Global advocacy and funding 

 The research has informed and prompted advocacy and action within and beyond individual countries. According to a senior health adviser at the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, the research ‘ *enabled the UK to support WHO with work on midwifery training and an action plan for countries’* **\[E10\]**. 

 According to one Director of a WHO Collaborating Centre working across Eastern Europe, the research has ‘ *influenced conceptual understanding of midwifery in countries where midwifery has been under\-valued \(or even non\-existent\) and where childbirth has become over\-medicalised to the detriment of maternal and newborn experiences and outcomes’*. They describe how policy makers and professionals across the region frequently reference **R1** ‘ *when formulating arguments to promote the development… of midwifery’*, how nurses and midwives use the evidence to ‘ *enhance their contribution to national maternity care strategies’* and how the thinking of senior policy makers has been *‘profoundly affected’*  in respect of maternal and newborn care **\[E11\]**. 

 The White Ribbon Alliance highlights changes at global and local level by donors as well as by countries, confirming that  ‘ *As a result of advocacy efforts which utilized evidence from the paper, the Government of Malawi increased the midwifery workforce with more than 50% and… established the position of Chief Midwifery Officer in Malawi’s central hospitals*’ **\[E9\]**; and in Bangladesh, the research *‘has been an important tool for advocacy of midwifery care to politicians, health care leaders, managers, nurses, midwives, doctors’* **\[E6\]**. 

  

 The work has directly influenced funding commitments including: USD16,000,000 from the MacArthur Foundation to “ *support a revival of midwifery”* in Mexico **\[E9\]** and CAD6,000,000 from the Canadian Government for Indigenous midwifery plus funding to “ *support midwifery association strengthening and continuing education in Benin, DRC, Ethiopia, Haiti, Mali, South Sudan, and Tanzania*” **\[E7\]**. Additionally, the Canadian and Swedish governments provided CAD50,000,000 to support midwifery in South Sudan, resulting in the *‘graduation of 45 nurses and 174 midwives; provision of antenatal care to 235,500 women and neonatal care to 58,817 babies, attendance of a skilled health professional at 59,444 births’* **\[E7\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In 1996, two years before Google was launched, Richards and his team established the **Archaeology Data Service**, an internationally recognised digital archive which preserves data, and makes it freely available online. Since 2014, our research into digital preservation and access has put the UK at the forefront of archiving developments throughout the world, and our impact now extends across national heritage agencies, local government, commercial contract archaeology, and the general public. We have developed new metadata standards and good practice, transformed access to grey literature, allowed non\-academic users unprecedented access to information, and changed publication models for major government\-funded infrastructure programmes. Our example has led to the establishment of at least six digital archaeological archives overseas since 2014. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 1996 the use of the Internet was in its infancy. The challenge of digital preservation was only just being recognised. The research team at York, led by Julian Richards, pioneered methods of exploiting the new technology to address the problem of preservation and accessibility of archaeological data \( **3.1**\). Their research underpinned the Archaeology Data Service \(ADS\). Since its inception the ADS has secured over GBP10,000,000 of external funding \(GBP3,500,000 received since 1 August 2013\) demonstrating its commitment to an ongoing programme of research into all areas of digital preservation, resource discovery and data sharing. 

 A key research project undertaken by the ADS was the creation of the so\-called ‘Grey Literature Library’. Before 2000 it had been extremely difficult for archaeologists to gain access to these unpublished fieldwork reports. With initial funding from JISC’s Research Support Libraries Programme \(RSLP\) and support from English Heritage, Richards led research into the capture, flow and usability of data from producers, such as contracting units and community groups, to users, such as local and national data managers \( **3.2**\). This led to the development of the OASIS online reporting service by ADS. Indexing reports had also been too costly and time\-consuming but research by ADS, including the use of Natural Language Processing for metadata enhancement, is adding new innovations to OASIS, including automated creation of metadata terms \( **3.3**\). Data loss was a major challenge and, in 2012, our research into the application of how the Open Archival Information System could be applied in Archaeology led to the Digital Preservation Coalition’s Prize for the most outstanding contribution to digital preservation of the previous decade. Since 2013 this recognition enabled an expansion of the ADS’s remit to facilitate preservation of, and access to, the results of commercial and community archaeology and, in April 2020, ADS was awarded the Core Trust Seal. Our work on preserving and publishing grey literature has been further underpinned by research on preservation formats which highlighted the risks of information loss in PDF files \( **3.4**\). 

 As use of the Internet expanded, Richards looked at ways to link data electronically across Europe and the world. In 2001–04 the ARENA project, funded by the EC Culture 2000 programme, allowed the ADS to broaden its horizons to work with European partners in developing technologies that enabled key European archaeological archives to be available online, to create a portal allowing access to sites and monuments data from the partners and to work towards a wider European network for archaeological archives \( **3.5**\). This research into interoperability and archive standards was developed in the ARIADNE \(2012–16\) and in the ARIADNEplus \(2019–23\) projects, for which ADS was the Deputy Coordinator, and which were named in the European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures roadmap \( **3.6**\). This led to our participation in E\-RIHS \(European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science\) where we researched how best to archive heritage science data \(2017–19\). ADS is also the only archaeological archive \(and one of only 3 UK partners\) in SSHOC \(the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud\) a major EU initiative which brings together all the legally recognised research infrastructures across these domains \(2019–23\). Our role is to research data standards and policies to allow archaeology to participate fully within EOSC \(the European Open Science Cloud\), with research into the special issues facing heritage science completed by 2020. Finally, in 2018 Richards was awarded a COST Action, leading 31 countries in *Saving European Archaeology from a Digital Dark Age,* where our research focuses on barriers to data re\-use.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The 2019 UKRI report on *The UK’s Research and Innovation Infrastructure* concludes that “The Archaeology Data Service \(ADS\) is a world\-leading digital heritage data archive that has been leading the development of digital preservation since 1996” \( **5.1**\). From 2014–20 new developments in OASIS have led information access policies in the UK, allowing non\-academic users unprecedented access to information. Our research into preservation and access has transformed how the results of archaeological fieldwork are archived and disseminated, influencing the strategies of major UK transport infrastructure projects from 2016–19, whilst the reach of ADS has inspired the creation of repositories in at least six other countries since 2014 and put us at the heart of European digital infrastructure initiatives. 

####  \(1\) Changing national policy and practice for archaeological reporting 

 Since 1 August 2013 the ADS Library of unpublished fieldwork reports has grown by at least 4,000 reports per year, as shown by our in\-system monitoring \(18,000 reports in 2013 – now over 60,000, being downloaded over 40,000 times a year\), with 565 new archaeological contractors registering to use OASIS, and over 55,000 new OASIS records created. OASIS is used by 137 local authorities \(to sign\-off planning conditions\), 4 national heritage agencies \(to update national lists\), and 8 other agencies \(including the Ministry of Defence, Historic Royal Palaces and the National Trust, for notifications about archaeological work\) \( **5.2a**\). The publication of grey literature by ADS has also led to a verifiable improvement in its quality. The Heritage Information Strategy Adviser for Historic England \(HE\) writes that: “Since the introduction of OASIS the digital publication and archiving of archaeological investigation reports, along with online availability of those reports with DOIs via ADS, has led to a clear and widespread improvement in the quality of commercially funded archaeological reports and the availability for re\-use of the archaeological information contained within those records and associated digital archives”. **  OASIS now sits at the centre of HE’s Heritage Information Access Strategy \(HIAS\) and the Strategy Advisor writes that “HE sees OASIS as having a crucial role in enabling the timely delivery of information gathered through investigations of the historic environment and as such in best increasing and sharing the value that such work has, whether undertaken through the planning system or research funding, for public benefit” \( **5.2b**\). From 2015 to 2020 OASIS has been redeveloped to embrace standing buildings archaeology, museums and community groups, with over GBP350,000 further funding from HE and over GBP130,000 from Historic Environment Scotland \(HES\) \( **5.2c**\).  The HIAS programme is recognised in the Government’s 2016 Culture White Paper and includes the work undertaken by the ADS on upgrading the current OASIS system. Most county councils now mandate OASIS usage and the 2018 Chartered Institute for Archaeologists \(CiFA\) report on *21st century challenges for archaeology* concluded that “The use of OASIS should be compulsory” \( **5.3**, p.40\). OASIS reporting is being used to directly inform archaeological research agendas and the system developed by ADS will be used to update the next generation of national and regional Research Frameworks being developed by HE and HES \( **5.4**\). 

####  \(2\) Transforming professional policy and practice for digital archiving 

 In 2017 the PUBLICAN report \( **5.5**\), a survey of over 75 public and commercial sector archaeologists, found that the ADS is having a positive impact on practice in \(a\) improving the design of development projects; \(b\) saving time when researching using existing resources; \(c\) filling gaps for Historic Environment Records \(HERs\); \(d\) changing policies to digital archiving in local government through providing best practice examples; \(e\) contributing to profile building for freelance specialists and commercial units; \(f\) highlighting gaps in service provision for digital dissemination outside archaeology; \(g\) improving workflows for local government; \(h\) providing continuing professional development \(CPD\) for the profession via the Guides to Good Practice; and \(i\) challenging perceptions about forms of publication. Nonetheless, the 2017 Mendoza review identified a crisis in archaeological archiving. The 2018 CiFA report addressed the challenge by recommending \(p.39\): “support for the nomination of accredited providers such as ADS”. An action plan from HE, endorsed by the then Minister for the Arts, Heritage and Tourism, Michael Ellis, recommended \(p.7\) that: “DCMS should welcome and endorse guidance from key archaeological organisations that, as soon as practicable, relieves museums of the expectation that they should attempt to curate digital archive material from archaeological projects, in favour of their deposition in a Trusted Digital Repository that will guarantee the preservation and accessibility of digital material, such as the Archaeology Data Service” \( **5.3**\). In practice, ADS is the only trusted digital repository for archaeology in the UK. ADS archiving has now been included as mandatory in specifications for archaeological works by over 25 county and city councils, and museums including: Birmingham, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Crawley, Co.Durham, Derbyshire, Devon, East Sussex, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Liverpool, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Salisbury, Staffordshire, Somerset, Suffolk, Tyne & Wear, Wiltshire, Worcestershire and City of York \( **5.6**\). 

 The ADS has also had a transformative impact on the ways in which the results of archaeological fieldwork, undertaken in advance of major government\-funded transport infrastructure projects, are archived and disseminated. The research into detailed metadata and data standards that we undertook in 2004 as part of providing easy navigation to the massive digital archive of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link \(CTRL\) \( [https://doi.org/10.5284/1000230](https://doi.org/10.5284/1000230)\) has underpinned further impact since 2014. In 2017 the success of CTRL archive led the engineering consortium in charge of the GBP18 billion Crossrail project to use ADS to enhance publication of their major excavations \( [https://doi.org/10.5284/1055125](https://doi.org/10.5284/1055125)\). The lead archaeologist for Crossrail noted that the CTRL archive has come to be seen as an exemplar by the field profession, and led them to turn to ADS “as a highly economic vehicle for sharing detailed datasets” \( **5.7**\). A similar approach has been adopted for HighSpeed2 \(HS2\), who note that their ADS digital archive will be “the largest historic environment digital archive ever compiled in the UK” and that ADS will allow them to safeguard their “digital legacy for future generations and deliver HS2 Ltd’s commitment to making data easily available under the Government’s Transparency agenda” \( **5.8**\). We have also been chosen by the Headland Archaeology / MOLA \(Museum of London Archaeology\) consortium, working on the GBP1.5 billion Highways Agency A14 bypass as the optimum means of providing full access to their discoveries, leading to a major financial saving on conventional publication \( **5.7**\). The A14 project director notes: “the ADS has had a major influence on our publication methodology for the A14 project, helping us to move away from a ‘one big book’ approach, to a varied, interesting and far more accessible strategy of dissemination, that is also very cost\-effective.” He adds that: “this will create a far longer\-lasting legacy...than traditional approaches”. Beyond the UK, the Head of Archaeology and Heritage at Transport Infrastructure Ireland says that the example of ADS has had a major impact on their own strategy, leading them to try to make their reports and data available online via the Digital Repository for Ireland \( **5.7**\). 

####  \(3\) Adoption of ADS as a model by overseas state archaeological archives 

 In 2012 ADS had already provided a model for public archives in the US, Sweden and the Netherlands, all now self\-sustaining repositories, and all used widely by non\-academic audiences. Since 2014 that reach has extended to Austria, Germany, France, Turkey, Argentina, and Japan \( **5.9**\), in each case providing repositories with broad public or private sector audiences. The ADS role in ARIADNE, and a workshop we provided in 2014, led to the establishment of an archaeological repository by the Austrian Academy of Sciences \(ÖAW\). Their Director comments that ADS “served as a model for establishing a repository for humanities research data at the ÖAW”. In November 2015 staff from the German Archaeological Institute visited ADS, and wrote: “The staff at the ADS can look back on almost 20 years of archiving digital archaeological data. What better place is there to learn about how it is actually done?” \( **5.9**\). In a 2019 publication \( **5.10**\), the European Projects Manager and colleagues from Inrap, the French state heritage service, wrote that: “It is worth mentioning here the digital repositories \(ADS, DANS, SND\) which directly influenced our institution by being good examples of concrete implementations of data sharing. With their specificities, successes and failures these top\-level organisations have a very strong influence on many institutions and specifically ours.” In 2017 ADS hosted a visit from staff of the British Institute in Ankara \(BIAA\) which led to the Institute establishing their own ADS\-like repository, and to making a follow\-up extended training visit in 2019. After a visit to ADS in 2016 by a representative of CONICET, the Argentinian national research council, Richards was asked to visit Argentina in 2017 and give a presentation to CONICET and Argentinian archaeologists. In 2018 this led to CONICET establishing a federated network of museum\-based repositories, funded by the Fundacion Williams. These aim to provide Open Access to data for archaeologists and the wider public \( **5.9**\). After visiting ADS in 2017 the Japanese Nara Research Institute were “inspired"" to put their grey literature online, leading to a policy change in Japan’s National Heritage Agency, with whom they work. In a paper published in 2019 they wrote that their database was “entirely a domestic project built to satisfy the needs of Japanese researchers and excavators. However, after the authors met with Julian Richards from the ADS in February 2017, and again in February 2018, things have changed drastically.” The reports \(previously never consulted by non\-archaeologists\) have had over 1,400,000 downloads, mainly by members of the public. Now over 1,400 Japanese municipalities require Japanese contractors to put their reports online via Nabunken \( **5.10**\). The ADS connection led to the US, Argentina and Japan joining the European ARIADNE infrastructure in 2019. ADS also leads the development of international standards for digital curation. Nara have translated the ADS Guides to Good Practice \(G2GP\) to provide data standards for contractors, and the Guides have also provided the basis for those published by the Swedish National Data Service \(SND\). The ÖAW report that ADS “policy documents served as best practice examples for our own”. The Director of the BIAA, comments that the G2GP and ADS web pages are “essential utensils to gather the know\-how to create a new digital repository” \( **5.9**\).

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Birmingham City University’s research on complex and multiple birth experiences enhanced clinical care guidance and practice. The first \(2017\) NICE guidance on preterm birth follow\-up care cites BCU research to improve care for the estimated 95,000 babies admitted to a neonatal unit in the UK.  The research led to improved care pathways for multiple birth families at one NHS Trust and to a 10% reduction in post\-caesarean section infection rates at another.  It featured in a BBC video on caesarean sections with over 1.7 million views worldwide and raised public understanding about multiple birth families through the Library of Birmingham’s “Multiple Realities” exhibition seen by an estimated 78,750 visitors. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 More than half of pregnancies that involve multiple foetuses have a preterm birth and a higher percentage of caesarean sections.  Birmingham City University’s \(BCU\) research on these complex and multiple birth experiences has been funded through competitive grants, attracting nearly £2.5 million pounds in external funding from the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) \(see Underpinning External Grants detailed in Section 3\). 

 **Complex Births \(Preterm\)** 

 The information needs of parents of preterm infants in neonatal units was not well understood prior to Harvey et al.’s \(2013\) qualitative study \[R01\] for ePrime: Evaluation of MR Imaging to Predict Neuro Developmental Impairment in Preterm Infants \(NIHR funded: RP\-PG\-0707\-10154\). R01 evidenced parents’ need for information about the routine care and interventions their infants receive on the neonatal unit, as well as about the long\-term prognosis of their babies. The study further evidenced the need for health professionals to provide information in manageable amounts because the emotional impact of having a preterm baby affects parents' ability to retain information.  Blackburn and Harvey’s \(2019\) mixed methods study \[R02\] evidenced the lack of support from health and education professionals for parents following pre\-term birth in the UK. R02 recommended health and education services provide more timely support that accounts for both the emotional and practical needs of parents. Such support needs were found to be especially acute for parents not prepared for the possibility of pre\-term birth. 

 **Complex Births \(Caesarean Sections\)** 

 Findings from the PREPS \(2020\) \[R3\] Trial, Vaginal Preparation at caesarean section to Reduce Endometritis and Prevent Sepsis – a feasibility study of Chlorhexidine Gluconate \(NIHR: Research for Patient Benefit, PB\-PG\-1215\-20013\), evidenced the efficacy and acceptability of vaginal cleansing \(in addition to routine cleansing of the abdomen pre\-CS\) in the prevention of surgical site infections \(SSIs\).  SSIs are common infections following CS that contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality. PREPs included the first qualitative study, conducted by Weckesser et. al. \(2019\) \[R4\], focused on women’s CS recovery in relation to infection and infection prevention.  R04 found women undergoing CSs need more information about what constitutes a ‘normal’ post\-operative recovery as well as infection prevention information provided in a written format \(rather than verbally post\-surgery\). It further evidenced how CS stigma, and women’s feelings of guilt for needing a CS, negatively affected their recovery experiences. 

 **Multiple Births** 

 Harvey’s and Denny’s \(2014\) study \[R05\] examined the health and social care needs of mothers of multiples. R05 evidenced an absence of support from healthcare professionals \(including midwives and health visitors\). The study recommended enhanced healthcare professional knowledge about multiples to improve information and support provision for such families. BCU research \[R06\] \(2018\) was the first to investigate health visitors’ experiences, as well as training and professional development needs, when supporting multiple birth families. R06 recommended the creation of an evidence base to inform and improve health visitor practice when supporting multiple birth families. 

 *Collectively, this research \[R01\-R06\] furthered understandings of, and provided robust evidence on, the information and support needs of families experiencing multiple births and/or complex births \(including preterm and CS births\).*

Extensively citing R01, the NG72 recommends health practitioners support parents by providing information about “the unit and routine neonatal intensive care unit care,” “care of the infant,” and “long\-term prognosis” of babies, as well as by “giving the right amount of information” \(to not ‘overwhelm’ parents\)  \[S01: p. 468\-493\]. The Chief Executive of Bliss, a charity for babies born premature or sick and a named supporting organisation in the NG72 quality standard \(QS169\), states, “Professor Harvey’s ePrime study informs guidance on the information provision to parents and carers… Babies born premature have the best long\-term outcomes when their parents are fully informed about, and involved in, their decision\-making and care, both during their time on the neonatal unit and in the years afterwards. Having access to clear, evidence\-based information is key to parents being able to fulfil this role” \[S02\].  The NG72, the first of guidance of its kind, provides clear and comprehensive evidence to inform quality standards, setting out a framework for consistent high\-quality follow\-up care for the estimated 95,000 babies born preterm every year in the UK. 

 **Preterm Births: Enhancing Professionals’ Understandings and Practice **                Blackburn and Harvey disseminated pre\-published \[R02\] findings at the \(July 2017\) BCU conference, ‘Born Early: Early Care and Education Experience of Children Born Prematurely,’ attended by health and education professionals.  Anonymous survey feedback reflects professionals’ enhanced understandings of the needs of children born preterm and subsequent practice change \[S03\]. A Perinatal Clinical Psychologist reported they would use their enhanced knowledge to “ease transitions between ICU, HDU and Special Care or to Paediatric ICU” \[Survey Response A16 in S03\]. An education practitioner stated, “As a team we will ask all parents about whether their child was premature, and we will work with schools to educate them more fully about the impact of prematurity on their pupils with physical and neurological disorders” \[Survey Response A10 in S03\]. 

 **Caesarean Section Births: Enhancing Clinical Practice and Public Understandings** 

 PREPS findings informed *Reducing Infections in Obstetrics* \(RIO\), Birmingham Women and Children’s Hospital’s \(BWC\) quality improvement initiative \[S04\]. The BWC Specialty Obstetrics and Gynaecology Registrar involved in the initiative, states the “RIO, informed by findings from PREPS \(PI: Prof K Morris, University of Birmingham; Co\-I’s Dr A Weckesser, Birmingham City University and Dr V Hodgetts Morton, BWC\), entailed the implementation of an ‘Infection Prevention Bundle’” \[S05\]. PREPS evidence on the use of chlorhexidine in vaginal cleansing procedures \[R03\] and patients’ need for written information on preventing infection post caesarean section \(CS\) \[R04\] was incorporated into the Infection Prevention Bundle \[S04: p.2\].  BWC implemented the RIO from January 2019 and “by January 2020 the SSI \(surgical site infection\) rate had decreased by 10%” \[ibid.\]. A reduction of significance as the hospital’s SSI rate \(21.08%\) was twice that of the national average \(9.6%\) in 2018 \[S04: p.1\]. BWC delivers an average of 8,200 babies a year; approximately 30% of deliveries are by CS as the hospital attracts high\-risk pregnancies from across the region. SSIs contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality and disrupt postnatal recovery, breastfeeding and infant\-parent attachment. Reduced SSI rates are key to improving maternal health and neonatal wellbeing. 

 Weckesser featured in a BBC educational video \[S06\], ‘C\-Section Guilt: I felt like I’d failed’, sharing PREPS findings \[R04\] on women’s experiences of stigma and guilt following caesarean section.  The BBC’s Senior Broadcast Journalist who produced the video states: “\[The BBC\] measures success with the discussion arising from the content as this means the audience was really engaged with the video. There were thousands of comments from women who said this video changed their perspective and made them feel less alone” \[S07\].  In September 2020, the video broadcasted on the BBC website, News Channel and social media outlets and “received 1,761,400 views across the BBC UK and international facing website, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram” \[ibid.\]. 

 **Multiple Births: Enhancing Training, Practice and Understandings  ** 

 BCU research \[R05\-06 and more\] led to, and forms the curriculum basis for, ‘The Individualised Care of Multiple Birth Families from Conception to 1 Year,’ CPD module for health professionals \(Levels 6 &7\). As a result of the module, an East & North Hertfordshire Trust \(ENHT\) Midwife created a continuous support pathway for women experiencing a multiple pregnancy within her Trust, for which she won the Chief Midwifery Officer Silver Award \(2020\) and was shortlisted for the Royal College of Midwives’ \(2020\) Johnson's Excellence in Maternity Care & Innovation \[S08\]. The ENHT Midwife states that “the research informed module has been significant in the success in improving our understanding of the unique support required by families of multiples, and has helped to shape and inform how we deliver our provision for these families” \[ibid.\]. 

 BCU multiple births research \[R05\-06 and more\] led to the “Multiple Realities” photography exhibition. For the month of September 2019, the Library of Birmingham hosted the exhibition in the main entrance hall, through which approximately 78,750 visitors pass monthly. Anonymous attendee surveys demonstrate the exhibit improved understandings of the challenges faced by multiple birth families by those who do not have multiples in their immediate family \[S09\].  *“\[T\]he exhibition made me think about the difficulties of raising twins and the loss involved with multiple births...*” \[Survey Response P26 in S09\]. 

 BCU research \[R05\-06 and more\] **,** undertaken with the Elizabeth Bryan Multiple Births Centre \(EBMBC\) founded with the Multiple Births Foundation \(an international authority on multiples\) informed the \(March 2020\) *Supporting Multiple Birth Families: Establishing an Evidence\-Base to Inform Health Visitor Practice.* The CEO of Twins Trust, the only UK\-wide charity dedicated to supporting families of multiples, states “research by Professor Harvey and colleagues identified the need for Standards for Healthcare Specialists for Multiple Births to improve the quality of care provided to families. Their work ensures that the views and experiences of families are included within evidence based guidance” \[S10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Cranfield University’s research on liquid\-to\-gas mass transfer has underpinned development and deployment of separation technology in both drinking water treatment and non\-sewered sanitation. The research has demonstrated how controlling the driving force for dissolved gas separation can minimise energy demand, enhance separation efficiency and improve the quality of recovered products, subsequently enabling opportunities for reuse. In addition to economic, regulatory, and environmental benefits, this research informed and influenced the structure and thresholds within the recently published  [ISO 30500](https://www.iso.org/standard/72523.html) standard on non\-sewered sanitation, which has been adopted by 18 countries.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Many industrial processes \(healthcare, food, and beverage\) now preferentially use bubble\-free liquid\-to\-gas mass transfer technologies to improve gas transfer efficiency. Contemporary challenges on compliance and energy recovery have advanced penetration of this technology into the water sector. However, water quality, solute chemistry, and industry’s desire to recover and convert separated gases into products, makes solute transfer \(e.g., Trihalomethanes \(THMs\) and methane\) from liquid to the receiving gas phase \(typically air\) more complex. Energy demand is also emphasised since municipal water flows are significant. 

 Research initiated in 2008 by Prof. McAdam has established novel scientific approaches for dissolved gas separation, ultimately delivering technological solutions for the separation \[R1, R2\], purification \[R3, R4\] and transformation of dissolved gases \[R5, R6\] into the water industry. Dissolved gas removal is achieved by establishing a concentration gradient to encourage migration from the liquid to a sweep gas. Currently industry apply an excess of sweep gas to maximise this concentration difference as this reduces technology capital cost, but as a consequence increases energy demand and prevents product recovery. An enabling contribution of this research for permanent \(carbon dioxide, methane\) and non\-permanent gas \(e.g., THMs\) separations has been to show that: 

1.  Dissolved gas mass transfer can still be effectively controlled at lower concentration gradients \[R2, R3\], 

1.  High interfacial area technologies can offset capital cost versus conventional approaches \[R1\]; and, 

1.  Counter diffusion of ternary gases from the sweep gas can enhance product quality beyond that theoretically predicted based on the concentration gradient established \[R3\]. 

 The collective contribution of this research \(2008\-2020\) is that low energy, compact and inexpensive dissolved gas separation can be achieved, coupled with the co\-creation of gas products that can be applied directly to energy generation \[R3\] or resource recovery \(e.g., water via a phase change\) \[R4, R6\]. 

 This scientific approach on liquid\-to\-gas mass transfer was extended to clean water production from heavily contaminated sources \(e.g., toilet wastewater\), in which sweep gas was used to introduce a vapour pressure difference between gas and liquid phases, subsequently initiating the selective separation of water vapour \(non\-permanent gas\) from wastewater, to produce a high\-quality water product from contaminated water sources \[R2, R4\]. Investigation of this separation revealed that dissolved gas mass transfer is not constant when concentration gradient is purposefully limited, which contradicted long held assumptions \[R2\]. This insight fostered a generic approach to mass transfer characterisation on which new liquid\-to\-gas mass transfer technologies were developed \[R1, R2\], including the ‘nanomembrane toilet’, an integrated household scale system for water recovery from wastewater \[R4\]. A further contribution of this research has been to identify that surface fouling of transfer technologies is controlled by the high molecular weight organic fraction \[e.g., R1\], whereas inorganic adhesion is governed by a kinetically controlled metastable region \[R6\]. The proof of the kinetic trajectories required to avoid surface fouling have been provided through McAdam’s European Research Council fellowship \(2017 to 2022\). 

 Named staff have collectively published over 20 related papers and submitted four patent applications, through research jointly funded by industry \(Anglian, Northumbrian, Scottish, Severn Trent, Yorkshire Water\), NGOs \(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\) and RCUK.

###  Meeting drinking water quality standards \(Scottish Water\) 

 This research enabled the first direct deployment of liquid\-to\-gas mass transfer technology into the UK water industry for the removal of THMs from drinking water. The Water Industry Commission is the Regulator in Scotland and uses an Overall Performance Assessment \(OPA\) to gauge Scottish Water’s performance. A key ‘OPA component’ is on drinking water quality where the level of service provided to customers is determined by the percentage of compliant samples. In 2013, Scottish Water embarked upon the first deployment phase \(Phase 1\) of liquid\-to\-gas mass transfer technology into 17 water treatment works serving rural catchments to reduce THM sample failures, in order to improve their OPA score, and ensure customer safety, as there is a suggested link between chronic exposure to elevated levels and carcinogenic effects. 

 During the design phase, McAdam was instructed to specify mass transfer technology, and operating conditions to achieve set THM treatment targets proposed by Scottish Water. Following commissioning, McAdam advised Scottish Water on technical modifications to newly commissioned liquid\-to\-gas mass transfer technologies, where design measures based on Cranfield University’s low energy mass transfer research were applied to overcome site constraints which limited power and compressor options, in order to improve the targeted removal of THMs. The Capital Liaison Team Manager who oversaw implementation of these investments for Scottish Water noted, 

 ” The advice from Cranfield helped us greatly and contributed to a better WQ \[Water Quality\] OPA position for Scottish Water”. \[S1\] 

 Cranfield’s design measures continue to positively impact on water quality for Scottish Water within the present REF period \(2014\-Present\) through improving compliance to the 17 works which underwent installation of liquid\-to\-gas transfer technology in the first implementation phase \(Phase 1\), as well as informing on the design of new installations \(Phase 2\). Scottish Water described how the, 

 “…information on bubble size, gas transfer and air to water ratio provided by Cranfield has continued to be applied including to two of our most recent systems installed in Ayrshire” \[S1\] \(Capital Liaison Team Manager\). 

 These two systems were installed in 2019, as part of a Phase 2 rollout, bringing the total capital investment in liquid\-to\-gas transfer technology to GBP4,000,000, and increasing the total number of installations to 41 individual drinking water works across Scotland all of which were based on principles founded through Cranfield research. 

###  ISO 30500 on non\-sewered sanitation systems 

 Since 2012, Cranfield University has been developing liquid\-to\-gas mass transfer technology that permits selective separation of water vapour \(non\-permanent gas\) from wastewater, by introducing sweep gas to create the necessary driving force for mass transfer, subsequently producing purified water from contaminated wastewater \(PCT/EP2017/054816\) \[S2a&b\]. This membrane technology has been licensed to a major sanitaryware manufacturer in China \(contract reference, P15931\) \[S3\]. 

  

 This is the core technology within the ‘nanomembrane toilet’, developed by Cranfield through strategic investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \(B&MGF\), within their ‘Reinvent the Toilet Programme’, which aims to provide access to equitable sanitation and hygiene for all to eradicate present practices which kill nearly 500,000 children under 5 each year. This represents an entirely new market, with an estimated value exceeding USD8,400,000,000 \(03,2021\). However, no ISO Technical Committee existed to address sustainable non\-sewered sanitation systems. In 2015, Tüv Süd \(Product Certification Service Provider\) were instructed by B&MGF to develop a globally recognised consensus standard, beginning with a Private Standard, which transformed into an International Workshop Agreement \(ISO IWA 24\). ANSI subsequently adopted ISO IWA 24 for publication as an International Standard. 

 Tüv Süd requested advice from Professor McAdam on materials selection, product specifications, standards, and test protocols during Private Standard development. The Senior Program Officer, who led investments in International Standards for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation described how, 

 “Cranfield’s technical expertise in developing the integrated ‘Nano\-membrane Toilet’ system for non\-sewered sanitation, greatly influenced development of the ISO 30500 standard” \[S4\]. \(Senior Program Officer, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\) 

 McAdam and Kolios were subsequently appointed to the Private Standard technical committee to provide advice to Tüv Süd on the standards specification and thresholds adopted. They continued to serve on the IWA committee up until adoption of the IWA by the ISO \(for confirmation, see p6, ISO PC305, August 2016 \[S6\]\). 

 “Their specific expertise in separation of liquid/solid streams …was instrumental to understanding and assessing the state of the art for different processing technologies which in turn supported the development of a comprehensive yet practical standard. Cranfield made strong technical contributions across different standard development phases from first International Workshop Agreement \(IWA\) through to publication of the full ISO standard. \[S5b\] 

 ISO30500: Non\-sewered sanitation systems *,* was published in October 2018, providing general safety and performance requirements for the product design & performance testing of prefabricated integrated treatment units that are not attached to a network sewer or drainage system. The Standard has since been adopted nationally by over 18 countries: \- North America \(US, Canada\), Europe \(UK, France\), Africa \(e.g., Algeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe\) and Asia \(Bangladesh\) \[S7\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The school component of English In Action \(EIA\) was a large\-scale project designed with the aim of improving English language teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools across Bangladesh. Using: i\) material delivered by mobile technologies; ii\) teacher development activities in the workplace and iii\) peer support opportunities, EIA provided an innovative way of improving English language teaching at scale. The EIA programme achieved large\-scale systemic engagement from teachers, head teachers and education officers across all eight divisions and 64 districts of Bangladesh. This has delivered an impact on: i\) **practitioners** by changing the classroom practice of 53,271 teachers \- away from presenting to students and towards encouraging more student\-talk in English ii\) **learning** by improving the English language competence of 7.4 million students and iii\) **public policy** by influencing two Government bodies to incorporate EIA materials into their curriculum resources and engage EIA expertise in the design of content for new teacher development programmes \- thus embedding the EIA materials and pedagogic approach within the Bangladesh educational system, to secure long\-term, sustainable, systemic change and iv\) public policy by influencing approaches to teacher development outside of Bangladesh.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 For many years, English language was the most failed subject in schools in Bangladesh. Poor quality English language teaching was identified as a root cause, with teachers not knowing how to put ‘Communicative Language Teaching’ into practice. Teachers themselves had limited English skills and students typically had very little opportunity to speak in English during English language lessons. Funded by DFID, over a 10\-year period, the school component of EIA focused on demonstrably improving English language teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools across Bangladesh. Researchers from the OU worked with international partners BMB Mott McDonald and BBC Media Action, as well as local NGOs such as Underprivileged Children’s Educational Programs \(UCEP\) and Friends in the Village Development Bangladesh \(FIVDB\) to develop an iterative EIA programme of research and development. Between 2008 and 2011 OU researchers developed and trialled their working hypothesis which posited that the most effective way of achieving large\-scale teacher development in Communicative English Language Teaching in Bangladesh was to implement a programme that was: 

 **Technology\-enabled**: bespoke audio resources alongside teacher development videos, that demonstrate and explore Communicative Language Teaching approaches in authentic classroom settings, are delivered using devices such as iPods/MP3 players or mobile phones. 

 **School\-based**: teacher development activities are delivered in the workplace \- where teachers enquire into their own classroom practice, explore new teaching\-learning approaches, and develop practical insights into improving student learning. 

 **Networked**: Teachers' development progresses through peer\-learning and shared journeys of discovery, as opposed to cascading 'knowledge' through teacher educators. 

 The initial EIA ‘intervention’ at the heart of the programme was therefore a school\-based professional development model that blended Technology Enhanced Learning \(where Communicative Language Teaching principles and examples were delivered through audio\- visual material on an MP3 player\) with face\-to\-face support, such as orientation workshops, cluster meetings with teachers on the same programme and visits from teacher facilitators. The appropriateness of this model was examined by conducting observations and interviews with 6 schools that were participating in a pre\-pilot intervention in 2009 \(randomly chosen from 15 pre\-pilot schools\). Data from classroom observations, regarding how teachers were using the technology, informed interviews with 12 teachers. Results indicated that the teachers responded well to both the pre\-loaded material on the iPod and the peer support from cluster meetings and facilitator visits. Furthermore, changes in practice were being reported after just four months **\[O1\]**. Further studies enabled a more nuanced understanding of the influence of the intervention. For example, field\-tests were undertaken with 40 teachers between March and April 2011 in order to ascertain whether teachers would prefer to use mobile phones \(with SD cards that contained pre\-loaded EIA material\) rather than iPods. Analysis of data taken from surveys, interviews and focus groups indicated that teachers preferred using mobile phones and found it easy to use the SD cards. These results informed the Upscaling Phase of EIA and enabled the programme to implement a more sustainable way forward **\[O2, O3\]**. Semi\-structured interviews were conducted with 600 primary school children from schools, in different regions in Bangladesh, who were participating in the pilot intervention phase in 2010. These interviews were used to examine the children’s beliefs concerning English language Learning and their perceptions regarding English language Teaching in an EIA pilot intervention school. Results indicated that overall, the children responded well to, and had positive beliefs about, the value of the activities associated with a Communicative Language Teaching approach **\[O4\]**. Finally, an overarching evaluation of the pilot intervention phase, used case study examples to illuminate the conclusion that teacher facilitators needed more support and guidance on how to enact their role in order to improve the effectiveness of the school\-based support model **\[O5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The EIA programme achieved large\-scale systemic engagement from teachers, head Teachers and education officers across all eight divisions and 64 districts of Bangladesh **\[C1\]**. Between 1st August 2013 to March 2018 EIA dramatically increased its reach, through a shift away from direct contact with international and national English Language Teaching \(ELT\) experts, towards a distinctive model where ELT practice expertise was embedded in Mediated Authentic Videos accessed on mobile phones, delivered through partnership with Government Teacher Professional Development systems and staff, and supported primarily by teachers’ peers \(including Teacher Facilitators\). From August 2013 to March 2018, over 53,000 teachers participated in EIA: 10,563 secondary teachers and 42,708 primary teachers **\[C2\]**. Collectively, these teachers taught approximately 7.4M school children \(3.1M primary and 4.3M secondary children\) **\[C2\]**. More specifically, EIA has achieved impacts on **practitioners**, **learning** and **public policy** in Bangladesh by: i\) changing the classroom practice of teachers; ii\) improving the English Language competence of students; iii\) shaping the content of English Language Teaching Curriculum Material and iv\) influencing approaches to teacher development in Bangladesh and v\) influencing approaches to teacher development outside of Bangladesh, demonstrating global impact. 

1.  **Changing the classroom practice of teachers** 

 There is evidence that EIA has contributed to changes in teachers’ confidence to speak English and use English in the classroom. For example, at a divisional workshop in Rajshahi in 2017, teachers underlined that EIA had triggered inner changes in them, which they saw as a pre\-condition for changing students: *“I changed myself, now I am a change maker. Without a change in students, a teacher is 0” \(*Assistant Teacher English/secondary and Teacher Facilitator, Rajshahi division, 23.8.2017\); *“EIA has developed me personally and professionally”* \(participant, Rajshahi Divisional Workshop, 23.8.2017\). The participants also reported that they felt more at ease speaking English among themselves and with their students: *“Now I am able to speak in English in any forum”* \(participant, Rajshahi Divisional Workshop, 23.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. EIA has also brought about changes in the classroom practices of teachers. In 2014\-2015, 1,600 teachers provided self\-report data, analysis of which indicated that over 71% said they used the teacher development videos every week and over 80% said they used EIA activities in the classroom every week. Government Education Officers observed 4,727 classrooms during this time and found that that 61% of students were seen using English in more than 50% of their talk\-time, with 86% of lessons including pair and group work **\[C3\]**. Systematic timed observations of 346 lessons by the 2014\-2015 cohort of teachers, showed similar changes in practice. The results show that both primary and secondary teachers are using a wide range of activities in the classroom and involving students in these activities. In this study, primary teachers were found to be organising 33% of the time, presenting 29% of the time, asking questions 18% of the time, and giving feedback 19% of the time. Secondary teachers were found to be organising 27% of the time, presenting 38% of the time, asking questions 21% of the time, and giving feedback 15% of the time. This is a change from the baseline study where teachers were observed to be primarily reading from the textbook and rarely involving students in activities **\[C4\]**. For 2015\-2016 teachers, a quasi\-experimental study \(including 163 systematic timed lesson observations\) found statistically significant experimental effects after only six months, just half\-way through the treatment. Primary and secondary teachers spent less time ‘presenting’ to students \(effect size r=0.2\); student\-student talk \(pair and group\) increased fourfold in primary lessons, from 4%pts to 16%pts \(effect size r=0.3\); whilst in secondary lessons, teachers and students both used more spoken English \(effect size 0.2\) **\[C5\]**. At a Divisional workshop in Rajshahi in August 2017, participants confirmed sustained use of the EIA interactive teaching activities and learners’ increased participation in the classes: *“Before EIA, I never used body language, acting and dancing in the classroom. I thought this was only for male teachers \[…\] that it was not for me. Now I use songs, rhymes, miming, acting, dancing. I feel very efficient in my work. My student teams are standing out in crowd at education and digital fairs. This is thanks to EIA. I changed myself and my sub\-district”* \(teacher participating in Rajshahi Divisional Workshop, 23.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. 

 **ii\) Improving the English language Competence of students** 

 There is large\-scale evidence for an improvement in learning outcomes for students who are taught by teachers who have engaged with EIA. Over 1,000 students \(579 primary, 480 secondary\) from the 2014 cohort took part in an end\-line study of English Language Competence \(ELC\), carried out by independent assessors. There were statistically significant differences showing substantial improvements over baseline for both primary and secondary students. For primary students, the pass\-rate rose 34.4%pts from 35.2% to 69.6%, whilst for secondary students, the pass\-rate rose 8.3%pts, from 74.5% to 82.8% **\[C6\]**. For 2015\-2016 students, a quasi\-experimental study \(1,802 students in pre\- and post\-test\) was conducted after only six months, just half\-way through the treatment. In treatment schools, the differences between pre\- and post\-test ELC were larger than in control schools \(rising by 0.3 Graded Examination in Spoken English \(GESE\) grades in treatment, compared to 0.2 grades in control\), but at this early stage the differences were not yet statistically significant. However, there were small\-to\-medium sized experimental effects for rural secondary students \(r=0.2\) and urban primary students \(r=0.2\) **\[C5\]**. Discussions with various stakeholders also indicate that teachers acknowledge that being in an EIA school has increased students’ confidence and proficiency in using English, in the classroom and among themselves: *“I visited 2\-3 classes in EIA schools in Manikgonj district. EIA is very fine; secondary students were spontaneously talking to us; students spoke English very fluently. In Bangladesh, children’s attitude towards English has changed. They have a courage for English and think that they can answer all questions. EIA has contributed to this. Students’ English results have also improved in the recent years. EIA has contributed to this”* \(Director \- Secondary at Department of Schools and Higher Education \(DSHE\), 21.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. 

 **iii\) Shaping the content of English language teaching curriculum materials in Bangladesh** 

 The EIA Programme team has influenced both primary and secondary curriculum in Bangladesh through its contributions to the work of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board \(NCTB\) in Bangladesh. BMB Mott MacDonald \(lead partner on EIA\) conducted two studies that produced recommendations, and the textbooks for primary schools were revised to implement these. EIA then helped review the new textbooks for primary teachers, grades one to five with regards to English language teaching. EIA worked with the Centre for British Teachers, who worked with NCTB, on the textbooks. The textbook revisions included the referencing of EIA classroom audios, where relevant to particular lessons. The new textbooks were distributed to teachers in 2013 \(grades one to three\) and 2015 \(grades four to five\). All teachers received EIA classroom audio recordings, as part of the NCTB’s distribution of the revised textbooks. The 2015 Terms of Reference for The NCTB Textbook Revision acknowledge EIA inputs into the English Textbooks for grades four to five **\[C1, C7\]**. ‘Teacher Editions’ are versions of the national textbook series that include instructional guides for teachers, on how to use the textbook content to support Communicative Language Teaching. In 2014, EIA technical experts contributed to writing all five Teacher Editions for English language primary teachers \(grades one to five\) **\[C8\]**. Content from EIA print materials \(i.e. *Activity Guides*\) were integrated into the Teacher Editions, particularly where they gave guidance regarding how to integrate digital audio resources in classroom teaching of specific lesson content. The Teacher Editions were published in August 2016. By 2017 they had been provided in print to every primary school \(two per school\) and had been distributed to all local Education Offices. They were also made available in soft copy on the NCTB website **\[C1\]**. Commissioned by the NCTB, EIA produced 36 audio recordings of ‘English for Today’ listening texts that accompany the NCTB textbooks for all secondary grades. Together with EIA’s own audios, these audios were uploaded on the NCTB website **\[C1\]**. The National Curriculum Coordinator Committee approved the audios and in 2014 the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education \(DSHE\) issued a circular asking all District Education Officers and Upazila Secondary Education Officers to ensure every head teacher/principal of a secondary school downloaded and used EIA audio materials **\[C9\]**. 

 **iv\) Influencing approaches to teacher development programmes in Bangladesh** 

 EIA materials and models have been integrated into in\-service teacher development in Bangladesh through the Subject\-Based Training \(SBT\) in English and the Customised Training Programme\-English \(CTP\-E\). SBT was a six\-day face\-to\-face training for in\-service teachers managed by the Department of Primary Education \(DPE\). The SBT Manual integrated 23 EIA A/V materials, and interactive teaching/learning activities. EIA supported the production of a Guide for trainers \(including a DVD with EIA digital contents\), and the training of 112 ‘Master Trainers’. Between 2014 and 2017, 115,000 Bangladeshi teachers have undergone SBT\-English, giving EIA inputs a wide reach. SBT has since stopped and has been replaced by the CTP\-E. The government has engaged several EIA staff as consultants in the design of the English element of this programme and its supporting materials \(e.g. Training Manual\) and the programme has integrated some of EIAs core components. For example, use of ICT and online/offline A/V materials is a key focus with all the trainers and teachers getting access to EIA digital A/V materials \(17 EIA videos have been integrated with different sessions on different days\) **\[C1\]**. Furthermore, most of the Government’s Master Trainers \(MTs\) for the CTP\-E are people who have been oriented to EIA, including many of EIA’s teacher facilitators/teachers: “ *EIA human resource is our resource*” \(DPE Deputy Director, 24.8.2017\). Among the 31 pilot Master Trainers, 22 have been oriented/exposed to EIA **\[C1\]**. 

 **v\) Influencing teacher development programmes outside of Bangladesh** 

 Key stakeholders have testified that EIA has had an impact beyond Bangladesh: *“EIA added to the global knowledge and debate around teacher professional development, by proposing a specific model based on 5 elements and by putting teachers at the centre of the classroom and evidencing what works in the classroom and to build teachers’ capacities”* \(DFID Education Adviser, 24.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. One example of the global impact of EIA is the Teacher Development Programme \(TDP\) in Nigeria. TDP, funded by DFID \(2013\-2019\), was implemented in partnership with the Nigerian Federal Government and 5 Northern State Governments. It aimed to improve the quality of teaching for 62,000 teachers in primary and junior secondary schools and in Colleges of Education. Several EIA staff members were commissioned to work with TDP on the construction of materials such as a Facilitators Guide and a Head Teachers Guide. In addition, TDP has modelled its approach on EIA, in that both EIA and TDP are school\-based teacher professional development programmes, with a blend of self\-study and face\-to\-face training and support **\[C1\]**. In 2017 the scale and quality of impacts achieved by the EIA project were recognised through two awards: The Times Higher Education Supplement \(THES\) award for International Impact \(November 2017\) and the Pie\-oneer Award for Progressive Education Delivery in H.E \(September 2017\). The THES judges said that EIA was a: *“clear winner for its global impact on English communication abilities in difficult\-to\-access regions”.* They commended staff at the OU *for their: “innovative and pragmatic solution as well as their collaborative approach, working with intergovernmental agencies and in\-country partners” and stated that “The OU’s development of teaching materials specifically designed for use on low\-cost mobile phones has had a transformative impact on the regions in which they have been deployed”.*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Aston University research in thermodynamic modelling and turbulent fluid flow has contributed to establishing a viable design for a greenhouse that uses seawater for cooling and irrigation. This has enabled the development of commercial food production facilities in arid, coastal regions including those in less economically developed locations. The impacts reported in this case study are: 

1.  Commerce and Economy – Seawater Greenhouse Limited has increased its capabilities and capacity to provide design, consultancy and project management services in the development of Seawater Greenhouses 

1.  Impacts on production – demonstration of seawater greenhouse designs to become commercially viable in the production of fresh vegetables in arid, coastal environments.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research at Aston University into seawater greenhouse technology was initiated by Davies who joined Aston in 2005 after completing a Royal Society Industry Fellowship at University of Warwick \(2003\-2005\) with sponsorship by Seawater Greenhouse Ltd \( [https://seawatergreenhouse.com/](https://seawatergreenhouse.com/)\). A programme of applied research was established at Aston, in continued collaboration with the company. Investigating the psychrometric properties of concentrated seawater was the starting point to develop a better understanding of seawater cooling and humidity control for agricultural greenhouses. As part of Davies’ start\-up package, Aston supported a PhD student to work on seawater cooling technology through thermodynamic modelling and experimental work. Facilities were set up for measuring the key properties of seawater and seawater brines, enabling several useful semi\-empirical correlations to be obtained for engineering design work **\[R1\]**. This was strengthened by collaboration with the Sfax solar salt works in Tunisia that supplied samples of seawater brines for analysis and testing **\[R2\]**. The PhD project included the construction of bench models and validation of models for the design of cooling systems **\[R3\]**. 

 In 2007, in parallel to the above PhD project, EPSRC awarded £712k under the programme ‘Energy and International Development’ with Davies as PI **\[G1\]**. The project investigated enhanced biomass production and energy conversion in rural, water\-scarce communities in India. A key outcome was a new highly efficient desalination concept that was well suited to treatment of brackish groundwater where energy is available as heat \(e.g. from solar or waste heat sources\). The concept results in minimal waste product, a concentrated brine, that can be used to cool greenhouses, enabling water efficient crop cultivation, and producing salt as a by\-product. The research developed prototype solar\-driven desalination and fan ventilation systems, that were tested over several months at Aston University **\[R4\]**. A pilot greenhouse later installed at GB Pant University of Agricultural Technology in India demonstrated for the first the use of desalination reject brine to cool a greenhouse **\[R5\]**. 

 An Innovate UK\-DFID project was awarded in 2015 to Davies and Generalis under the Agri\-Tech Catalyst programme **\[G2\]**, in collaboration with Seawater Greenhouse Ltd and Pastoral and Environmental Network in the Horn of Africa \(PENHA\). The aim of this project was to simplify and improve the technology for use in developing countries for which the level of investment required by the earlier systems would not be feasible. The simplified design made use of wind\-driven ventilation and low\-cost net cladding, in place of polythene or glass greenhouse cladding. Due to the bimodal climate in Somaliland, the prevailing winds blow mainly from two opposing dimensions and the design had to accommodate this. The complex wind pattern and permeable cladding gave rise to a challenging modelling and design problem that was a addressed using numerical techniques developed by Generalis and Akinaga, who created bespoke code for fast execution of year\-round modelling using weather data as inputs, making use of expertise from Generalis and Akinaga in solving Navier\-Stokes equations representing turbulent flows **\[R6\].**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Seawater greenhouses are enabling sustainable crop cultivation in arid world regions. They use seawater for both cooling and irrigation making them independent of freshwater resources. They are powered by renewable energy so are not dependant on fossil fuels. Seawater greenhouse technology is helping address food security, climate change resilience, resource scarcity and population expansion. The following impacts arising from Aston research are claimed.

 Seawater Greenhouse Ltd has benefitted from many years of research collaboration **\[S1,S5,R1\-R6\]** with Dr Philip Davies and, in more recent years, Dr Sotos Generalis that have supported the company “to offer consultancy, design, construction and project management services in their construction” **\[S1\]**. During the current REF period, this culminated the development of design tools embedding Aston\-developed modelling algorithms which eliminates the “long process of trial and error *”* from the design of greenhouses **\[S1\]**. This was first deployed in the design options for the seawater greenhouse in Somaliland \(see below\). The tool enables the design of facilities to take account of local conditions by using as modelling inputs location specific data such as wind direction and velocities. The “design of seawater greenhouses for each locale is accelerated from months to minutes *”* and “enabled deployment of Seawater Greenhouse technology in less economically prosperous countries *”* **\[S1\]**. 

####  Impacts on Production \- demonstrating economically viable food production facilities in arid countries \(Sundrop Farms, Pastoral and Environmental Network in the Horn of Africa \(PENHA\), Red Sea Farms\) 

 *Sundrop Farms \(* [https://www.sundropfarms.com/](https://www.sundropfarms.com/)\): The experience gained in the EPSRC project with photovoltaic powered\-fans combined with evaporative cooling was applied to the design of a project for Seawater Greenhouse Ltd, in a joint venture with Seawater Greenhouse Australia, through a consultancy arrangement **\[S1\]**. This project was to construct an initial pilot seawater greenhouse covering 2000m<sup>2</sup> at Port Augusta, Australia \[ **S2**\], which was taken forward by Sundrop Farms which established itself in 2012 as an independent company at which time the joint venture with Seawater Greenhouse Ltd was discontinued **\[S1, S2\].** In 2014, Sundrop Farms scaled up its operations in attracting investment of $US100 million enabling the construction of a 20\-hectare commercial greenhouse that incorporates seawater cooling. In their total $AUS200 million **\[S3\]** facility, Sundrop farms now produce 10\-15% \(350 tonnes/week; 17,000 tonnes/year\) of Australia’s truss tomatoes and employing 150 workers **\[S3, S4, S5\]**. 

 *PENHA \(* [https://www.penhanetwork.org/](https://www.penhanetwork.org/)\): The Horn of Africa is the most food\-insecure region of the world \- some 40% of world food aid goes to the region costing the EU alone more than 1 billion euro p.a. By 2050, the population is predicted to increase by 150%. The Seawater Greenhouse process uses solar energy and seawater to provide a new source of fresh water and a cooler and more humid climate, enabling high crop yield with optimised water use efficiency as evaporative cooling typically reduces crop water demand by 60\-80%, compared to open\-field cultivation. 

 As a result of the findings from the Innovate UK\-sponsored research, construction costs have been lowered from $US100 to $US20 per square metre of cultivated area **\[S1\]**, demonstrated by the seawater greenhouse commissioned in Somaliland in 2017. In 2018 the facility reported its first harvest **\[S6\];** see also  [https://mailchi.mp/d56cf06c0ac8/penha\-newsletter\-june\-2018](https://mailchi.mp/d56cf06c0ac8/penha-newsletter-june-2018). This project also involved the development by Aston of a Decision Support Tool that incorporated turbulent fluid flow modelling and simulation algorithms. Local data on wind speeds and directions are used as an input to the tool with the outputs being data that enables key design parameters for the greenhouse to be identified. The Somaliland system makes use of integrated desalination and salt production as proposed in earlier research at Aston **\[R6\].** 

 *Red Sea Farms \(* [*https://redseafarms.com/*](https://redseafarms.com/) *\)*: Researchers at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology \(KAUST\) spun out a company to develop saltwater greenhouse technologies to encompass new build and retrofit applications as well as provide consultancy services on saltwater and desert agriculture. Davies was invited to KAUST in 2012, and three times subsequently, to advise on desalination strategies for a design study on commercial saltwater greenhouse facilities for food production. In 2018 Red Sea Farms was spun out of KAUST and attracted $US1.9 million funding to build a 2,000m<sup>2</sup> greenhouse to scale up production aiming to produce 50 tonnes/year of tomatoes annually by 2021 **\[S7\]**. Red Sea Farms also operates several production facilities producing fresh tomatoes to seven markets in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia \( [https://redseafarms.com/produce/](https://redseafarms.com/produce/)\). 

 Recognition for this and preceding projects was given by the national Shell Springboard prize for low\-carbon businesses \(£150k\) which was awarded to Seawater Greenhouse Ltd in May 2018 **\[S8\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Centre for Christian Education undertook research with key stakeholders in the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales to evaluate the nature and assess the provision of adult theological literacy through the Catholic Certificate in Religious Studies \(CCRS\). This fed directly into the formation of teachers for Catholic schools and those taking up lay ministries in local contexts. Concrete changes in policy, administration, curriculum and delivery at national, regional and local levels resulted, specifically across Catholic dioceses, schools and universities. Internationally, the research supported a major review of adult religious education in Ireland in addition to wider knowledge exchange. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Catholic Bishops Conference of England & Wales \(2000\), *The Priority of Adult Formation,* called for national and local initiatives for theological formation for catechists, teachers, parish ministers, parents and lay leaders, highlighting a lack of existing research. The need for adult theological literacy has since been emphasised by church leaders and practitioners but received limited research attention. 

 In this context, a project proposal was by drawn up Dr Ros Stuart\-Buttle through the Centre for Christian Education at Liverpool Hope University. The aim was to stimulate national conversation and theological reflection among the Catholic community about the nature, purpose and provision of adult theological literacy in light of changing contemporary religious, socio\-cultural and educational contexts. 

 The project was submitted to the Catholic Board of Religious Studies, and approved by that body in May 2015. The Board subsequently agreed to fund the project at its October 2015 meeting. From the outset, the project was a response to established practical concerns, and it was welcomed and practically supported by Catholic agencies at a national level. This involved significant partnerships with churches and wider communities, resulting in interdisciplinary and impact\-oriented engagement with academic and non\-academic audiences across ecclesial and educational sectors. 

 The research employed stakeholder theory **\(see R1\)** to identify key stakeholders across England and Wales and gain collaboration from the Catholic Bishops Conference of England & Wales Dept of Education and Formation, Catholic Education Service, National Board of Religious Inspectors and Advisers, Diocesan Schools Commissioners, and Catholic dioceses and universities. Briefing papers, international/national conference presentations, and published outputs resulted in knowledge exchange and wide debate about the priority and practice of adult theological literacy for today’s contexts **\(R3, R4\).** 

 The research specifically examined the role and impact of CCRS, a leading national resource for adult theological literacy. In existence from 1991 and since accessed by over 30,000 adults in the UK and overseas, CCRS contributes to the formation of teachers for Catholic schools and lay ministries in local contexts. Phased research undertook systematic analysis with multiple CCRS stakeholders concerning the nature and provision of adult theological learning, the implications for theological literacy, and where future directions might be sought. Between March 2016 and March 2018, quantitative and qualitative data was gathered as first\-hand evidence from 1,474 participants via online survey, alongside 12 structured interviews with Catholic bishops, diocesan leaders, and school primary and secondary head teachers, between March 2016 and March 2018. 

 The publication of the research report *CCRS Twenty Five Years On* in March 2019 **\(R2 and S3\)** strongly affirmed the value of CCRS among stakeholder constituencies and gave clear evidence of the continuing need and priority for supporting adult theological literacy today, especially for teachers in Catholic schools and those involved in local lay ministries. In offering a rigorous critical lens to assess the status and delivery of CCRS, the research enabled Catholic education stakeholders to evaluate their own provision and approaches to adult learning. 

 The research recommendations were taken up by the Catholic Bishops Board of Religious Studies and leading church education agencies. They have led to concrete changes in CCRS policy, administration, curriculum and delivery at national, regional and local levels, specifically across Catholic dioceses and universities. Wider impact through dissemination of the research to academic and researcher\-practitioner audiences has directly stimulated new thinking about adult theological literacy and influenced new research in Ireland on adult religious education through knowledge exchange with international colleagues in Catholic education research networks **\(R3, R5\).**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact can be divided into three areas: firstly, its role in shaping Catholic education policy at a national level; secondly, the application of the research findings by local CCRS providers; and, thirdly, wider impacts established via communication of the research findings to audiences of school heads and to the Irish Catholic church. These aspects of impact show the research was effective, not just in renewed interest and take\-up of the CCRS, but in key aspects of its promotion, pedagogy, student experience and extension to new audiences. 

 *Impact on Catholic education policy* 

 The Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Wales Board of Religious Studies utilised the research on adult theological literacy to inform and implement national policy for CCRS. Specific measures included new publicity \(national rebranding completed March 2020\), curriculum revision \(specialist modules review undertaken during 2019\-20\), recommendations for enhanced standards for assessment and course resources, and improved regional moderation/quality assurance. The Board, in representing Catholic Education Service, Diocesan Religious Directors/Schools Commissioners, National Board of Religious Inspectors and Advisers, and 27 Catholic dioceses, universities, and distance providers of CCRS, holds considerable influence on Catholic education policy. Their engagement with the research was maintained from the outset, alongside a Steering Group drawn from across the sector. Evidence is demonstrated in minutes from ten Board meetings between May 2015 and March 2020, including an Extraordinary Board \(January 2019\) to begin implementation of the research recommendations **\(S1\).** 

 Significant policy influence resulting from the research is evidenced through the commendation of the Bishops Department for Education and Formation **\(S6\),** who stated formal thanks for ‘this valuable survey of the impact that CCRS has had over the last twenty\-five years, and could have in the future’, adding that the Department Chairman ‘welcomed the research recommendations which have been made as a result of this research, fully affirming the Church’s commitment to the role and contribution of CCRS to adult theological formation across England and Wales’. 

 The National Board of Religious Inspectors and Advisers noted the ‘first\-class input and sharing of CCRS Twenty\-Five Years On: One Size Fits All’ received at their 2019 conference. The Board pledged their ‘continued engagement with and support for CCRS’ and their ‘formal endorsement of our support for CCRS and the endorsement of \[the report’s\] research findings’ **\(S7\).** The Catholic Education Service, likewise, endorsed the research findings in their communications to Diocesan Schools Commissioners/ Directors of Religious Education **\(S8\).** They used the research as a catalyst to directly promote CCRS to teachers in Catholic schools across England and Wales **\(S8\),** a policy move made in direct response to the research findings. As Fr Des Seddon, Chairman of the Board of Religious Studies of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales, stated ‘“The recommendations will provide the Board of Studies with a way forward for the next Phase of developments for the CCRS” **\(S9 and R2\).** 

 *Impact on CCRS providers* 

 Extensive, localized application of research findings was adopted by diocesan, university and distance\-learning CCRS providers; a sample is included below. Purposefully\-designed impact collection measures included questionnaires sent to all 27 CCRS centres during 2019 and formalised impact sessions at National CCRS Review Conferences in 2016, 2018 and 2020. Evidence is taken from questionnaire responses and National Review formal transcripts **\(S2 and S4\).** 

-  *Evaluation of current practice, workforce training and future planning.* Hexham and Newcastle Diocese used the research for their 2019 annual moderation to affirm current practice and implement curriculum changes. Shrewsbury Diocese held staff discussions on the research during 2019\-20, prompting an overall review of local curriculum and pedagogy, with encouragement to diversify their teaching methods for fostering greater student participation. Westminster Diocese made changes to their assessment practice, adopting new assessment styles in a move away from the traditional essay. 

-  *Use of the research for enhanced/focused advertising for example in* Brentwood and  Hexham and Newcastle Dioceses; the latter abandoned their traditional course information evening and created a social media clip highlighting the benefits of CCRS from the research, now used successfully for recruitment purposes. 

-  *Changed practices to enhance student experience.* Newman University acted on a specific challenge identified in the research for young teachers \(workload, lack of theological capacity, professional pressures etc.\) and subsequently introduced 2 mentors to support their Initial Teacher Education \(ITE\) students. 

-  *Supporting theological literacy for teachers in Catholic schools.* Liverpool Archdiocese, as a direct consequence of the research, contacted teachers across all Catholic schools in the archdiocese, resulting in 65\+ new teachers starting CCRS in 2019\-20. Other dioceses, such as Clifton, were prompted to develop professional ITE partnerships. 

-  *Supporting theological literacy for lay ministers through enhanced adult formation opportunities*. Wrexham Diocese identified a new target local audience for CCRS to include non\-teachers. Northampton Diocese developed a new module on Catechesis and incorporated this into diocesan\-wide catechist training. Brentwood Diocese prepared a new module on Evangelisation for parish participants. 

-  *New financial and administrative arrangements to support adult learning.* Liverpool Archdiocese created a new paid administrator role and made financial grants available to course participants. Other centres reported new financial arrangements with local schools to support teachers taking CCRS. 

-  *More flexible adult learning provision.* Westminster Diocese introduced twilight and weekend sessions in direct response to research recommendations calling for flexible delivery. Plymouth entered discussion with local headteacher and Diocesan advisers to reintroduce CCRS into the diocese. 

 *Impacts on wider understanding and learning* 

 The research impact on furthering knowledge exchange between academia and the public sphere is confirmed through these examples: 

 Dissemination of the research through published articles for professional \( *Networking: Catholic Education Today* vol 21, issue 1, pp.28\-30\) and pastoral audiences \( *The Pastoral Review* vol 15, issue 5, pp.24\-28\) prompted an upsurge of responses from Catholic schools/headteachers requesting CCRS for their staff as well as personal testimony from individuals affirming the need/importance of adult theological literacy for professional\-vocational contexts \(private documentation\). 

 The Network for Researchers in Catholic Education invitation to Dr Stuart\-Buttle for a keynote presentation at their international conference in October 2019 influenced colleagues from the Irish Episcopal Conference to investigate how their initial teacher education programmes could be made available to adult parishioners seeking to develop their own theological literacy. This had not been the case in Ireland before. This led to a new research project in Ireland on Adult Religious Education and Faith Development at Mater Dei Centre for Catholic Education, Dublin City University. As Dr Gareth Byrne states, ‘All in all the review of the CCRS twenty\-five years on has created a new conversation between providers of CRS in Ireland and those overseeing CCRS in England and Wales.’ **\(S5\).**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Morgan is a creative methodologist and practitioner who employs geopoetics techniques to foster relationships between place and the moving body. The methodology has generated original artworks, innovative artistic practices, and new conceptions of identity, community, health and well\-being among practitioners, participants, and audiences. Work completed in North Staffordshire has produced: 

1.  enhanced understandings of collective identities, social histories and trauma 

1.  reflections on abilities and disabilities, mobilities, everyday routines 

1.  changes to creative practices through collaboration with artists. 

 These impacts have benefited a wide range of audiences through Morgan’s exhibition; a show she co\-created and performed with artist\-writers \(Restoke\) and community participants; Anna Macdonald’s participatory moving\-image work and the co\-created exhibition and online exhibition artefact, 'Circling \(Again\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2015, Morgan has applied her geopoetics methodology in North Staffordshire, leading workshops with a range of groups, including members of a former coal\-mining community, residents of an area affected by failed regeneration, and individuals with persistent pain. The workshops have generated new artworks \(creative writing, photographs and other visual arts, dance, film, music and sound art\) and innovative artistic practices. They have challenged participants’ understandings of ‘walking’ as just a bipedal practice \(R6\), conceptually extending ‘walking’ into a practice for accessing collective memories and traumas, a restorative source of health and well\-being. Morgan’s participatory research has been informed by her criticism and artistic practice on place, mobilities, and embodiment, which includes her monograph on literary geographies in the contemporary Montreal novel \(3.1\), followed by a digital map of fictional Montreal \(3.2\) featuring audio recordings of authors reading extracts of their works set in the city. Both monograph and map invite reflections on affective attachments to place, reading and writing practices; embodied forms of knowledge; and how imaginary and material geographies shape each other \(3.3\). Morgan has developed her creative practice alongside her critical work. Her recent prose\-poems combine elements from travel\-writing and sensory geographies in their exploration of a body moving through various sites \(3.4, 3.5\). The methodology Morgan has devised draws on geopoetics \(defined here as site\-responsive creative practices\) including the approaches of La Traversée, the Montreal geopoetics research group, notably the mobile workshop \( *l’atelier nomade*\). Her geopoetics research is also informed by geocriticism \(notably polysensoriality\), psychogeography, and other mobilities methods from the humanities and social sciences, such as the walking interview \(3.6\).  During 2020\-22 the method will be further developed in national and international contexts, in two AHRC\-funded projects: ‘Planning Creativity’ explores community responses to decommissioning at three English sites; and ‘Heartlands/ *Pays du coeur*: Geohumanities and Quebec's “regional” fiction’ focuses on Québec’s Eastern Townships. 

 **Principal research insights/outcomes:** 

-  Mobile, site\-responsive embodied creative practices can be used to engage a range of publics, from artists to current and former industrial workers to members of the local community, as detailed below \(3.6\) 

-  Practices for creating new artworks by bringing together mobilities, writing, composition, dance, sound art, performance and visual arts \(3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\) 

-  Artefacts which engage with affective attachments to place can generate new understandings of community and belonging \(3.2, 3.3, 3.5\) 

-  The ways in which artefacts which engage with themes of trauma, working and striking practices generate new understandings of social history \(3.5\) 

-  Participation in collective, site\-responsive activities can foster health and well\-being \(3.6\) 

-  Arts\-based methods are able to improve well\-being amongst individuals with persistent pain \(3.6\) 

-  Geopoetics can change relationships to the spatial in individuals’ everyday lives \(3.6\) 

-  Walking is not to be equated only with bipedal forms of mobility \(3.6\) 

-  Material and imaginary geographies inform each other \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\) 

-  The importance of other knowledges besides academic/intellectual knowledge, including embodied knowledge and knowledge based on learned experiences \(3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 3.6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impacts on understanding, learning and participation** 

 Creative artefacts from a workshop entitled ‘Memories of Mining’ \(2016\), held at Silverdale Country Park to mark the 50th anniversary of the Aberfan Disaster, formed the basis of an exhibition at Silverdale Community Library \(2017\), and a show, called *Seams* \(2018\). Created in collaboration with Restoke, a non\-profit arts organisation, *Seams* was performed on 11 June 2018 at Keele Chapel. 16 community volunteers aged 14 to 78 joined 3 professional performers and 4 Keele members \(1 academic, 3 postgraduate students\). The show was attended by 150 people. 

 *Seams* generated increased public understanding of Aberfan and similar catastrophes and their long\-lasting emotional and embodied effects on communities. Audience members’ reflections include: “ *as someone who’s not from the mining community I, rather naively, did not know just how many people/communities are still affected by mining disasters”* \(5.2\); “ *I learnt more about the culture, memories, loss and tragedy of mining in 35 minutes than in any academic paper or book”* \(5.3\). The show fostered shifts in perception of coalmining and its position within communities, as illustrated in comments such as “Seams moved me and caused me to reflect in a way I never have before about mining, work, loss, community and love”, and “ *it helped me to view our mining history more positively”* \(5.2\). The international sharing of memories of mining disasters was highlighted in comments from audience members from Poland and Germany \(5.3\). 

  

 **Impacts on health and well\-being** 

 Morgan’s mobilisation of geopoetics and screendance introduced a new lifestyle intervention aimed at enhancing individual well\-being \(5.4, 5.5\) through engaging under\-represented members of society in creative practices. Morgan's collaboration with dance and moving\-image artist Anna Macdonald resulted in ‘Circling: Interdisciplinary arts\-based research into the pathways of chronic pain’, which recruited 6 participants to a pilot project. Aged 19 to 60, participants had a variety of chronic health conditions, all characterised by persistent pain and reduced mobility. ‘Circling’ fostered changes to perceptions and experiences of persistent pain \(5.6\), changes to everyday negotiations of space \(5.4, 5.5\), and enhancements in quality of life \(5.6\). One participant noted, ‘” *it's been a different experience in translat\[ing\] my pain and it has giv\[en\] me an opportunity to rethink from a new perspective”*.  \(5.5\). A digital event showcasing Circling \(5.6\) elicited the following from audience\-members: “ *having never experienced chronic pain, it gave me an understanding that I would not otherwise have gained”*, and “ *I had not thought of pain as movement and rhythm before this workshop”, “these stories are not usually ones that are heard”* \(5.7\). 

 **Impacts on creativity \- the co\-production of new cultural artefacts** 

 ‘Memories of Mining’ \(2016\) produced poems, short stories, photographs and music, exhibited/performed at Silverdale Community Library \(November\-December 2017\). A Creative Community Walk held in Longport and Middleport \(Potteries, Stoke\-on\-Trent\) in June 2019, was attended by 15 people. Morgan co\-led a workshop with visual artist Nicola Winstanley, which ended with the co\-curation of an exhibition at the Waiting Room Gallery, Longport. This was refined and enlarged throughout its two\-month show \(June\-August 2019\). Visitors added to the exhibition with thoughts and memories of the area via writing in a book artefact \(5.8\). Exhibits comprised creative writing, photography, film poetry, installations, sketching and painting \(5.8\). 

 **Morgan has influenced new forms of creative thinking through her collaborative research with practitioners** 

 Restoke Co\-Creative Director, observed, “ *we liked the idea that we could move between \[…\] the now and the then, and look at the memory and the nostalgia, but the reality and then the re\-landscaping of collieries”* \(5.1\). Anna Macdonald remarks, “ *the openness of the geopoetic scores... offered the participants a really useful processing space …I would really think about the amount of space I offer people in a future work and certainly look to use more outside work as this helps regulate the intensity \[…\] a lot”* \(5.7\). Nicola Winstanley comments, “ *\[I’ve become\] more confident in my writing – it has become a \[…\] bigger feature of my practice now, especially in these times where we can’t collaborate \[…\] in any physical sense”* \(5.9\). Rebecca Goldsmith, film\-poet and participant in the Creative Community Walk, observes, “ *I’ve worked in participation for more than 15 years, and that session has challenged my practice as a participation curator/project\-manager \[…\] because I was so taken by how doing less can result in more, and \[how\] having faith in the process can really unlock a lot more than if you try to be too prescriptive \[…\]. It \[…\] really had a sense of magic”* \(5.9\).

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since 2004, Lancaster University Management School \(LUMS\) researchers have examined the relationship between the economic value added by human resources \(human capital, or HC\) and the propensity of companies to publicly report relevant data. The research has: challenged and redefined the principles and practices of the world’s leading accounting firms; led to the development of a new HC reporting framework positively impacting UK company disclosures; and it has supported HC research for a major global initiative, *Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism* \(EPIC\), which subsequently adopted LUMS techniques of measuring HC. In a culmination of the recognition of LUMS’ work, in August 2020 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \(SEC\) made a significant policy change that requires >7,000 globally significant U.S. companies to disclose the number of people they employ and any HC measures or objectives they focus on in managing the business. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The way we value our relationships with organisations and the products they create is changing, and this has a concomitant effect on the underlying financial value of organisations. People and their management are becoming increasingly material to this revaluation. Over a decade\-and\-a\-half, research carried out into performance\-led HR at LUMS has sought to raise awareness of human capital \(HC\) management, and to enable global corporations and their stakeholders \- investors, employees, suppliers and wider society \- to better understand how they manage, measure and report on the value creation of their people. In their early development of an alternative approach to HC measurement, Hesketh and Fleetwood were able to combine academic research with unusually deep levels of participative collaboration with leading global companies over a long period. These companies had combined strategic responsibility for around 7 million UK employees, approximately one quarter of all UK employees. 

##  An alternative path to understanding human capital: Return on Invested Talent \(ROIT\) 

 In 2004, Hesketh and Fleetwood interviewed 50 corporate executives in FTSE 100 companies \(such as Barclays Bank, Lloyds Bank, Marks & Spencer and Tesco\), revealing the difficulties confronted – patchy and inchoate practices, inaccurate data – when using conventional methods to understand, develop, measure and report the value of HC in organisations \[R1\]. Between 2006 and 2010, the researchers set out an alternative path to understanding the value released by HC, one that took account of its materiality to a firm’s financial performance \[R2\]. Viewed retrospectively, this approach represented a marked, and sometimes unwelcomed, but necessary departure from a long\-standing focus in academic, managerial, consulting and financial circles on property, plant, and equipment, and recognised the role of HC in driving value creation \[R3\]. When these research insights and conceptual framework were unpacked in a subsequent piece of work with Deloitte, the resulting research led to a five\-step process to calculate gross and net returns on HC, conceptualised as *Return On Invested Talent* \(ROIT\) \[R4\]. This gave a firm’s executives, shareholders and other interested parties an objective, analytically informed measure of the financial implications of employee\-related interventions – the opening salvo on the long journey towards a change in U.S. financial reporting regulations that recognised HC factors as ‘material’ to investors’ or wider stakeholders’ concerns. 

##  New standards for human capital disclosures: Valuing Your Talent 

 In 2013, following increased awareness among practitioners of his work, Hesketh obtained funding from the UK Commission for Employment and Skills \(UKCES\) for the Valuing Your Talent \(VyT\) research project. In collaboration with the three professional bodies representing accountancy \(CIMA\), management \(CMI\) and human resources \(CIPD\), Hesketh developed, tested, and published a significant piece of empirical research \[R5\] with participation by 70 major companies \(e.g. Asda, Diageo, Nestle, Oracle\) and the investment and regulation communities \(Financial Reporting Council, International Accounting Standards Board\). Supporting case studies \(Microsoft, Xerox, Unilever, Arcelor Mittal\) illustrated the processes and practices of HC management in leading multinationals. Analysis mapped and established the financial value of HC through a new analytical framework to inform disclosures by companies. This meant narrowing down indicative metrics from an unwieldy 400\-plus to just 4: employee turnover, well\-being, training and cost. 

##  Performance advantage and human capital disclosure: EPIC 

 In November 2016, accounting firm Ernst & Young \(EY\) and the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism in the US, invited LUMS to develop a new human capital disclosure instrument based on \[R5\] for inclusion in the *Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism* \(EPIC\) \[R6\]. EPIC was set up with the intention of making corporate reporting more useful by developing a framework and metrics to better articulate the long\-term value created by businesses. Participants included 31 CEOs from asset owners \(pension managers such as CalPERS\), asset managers \(investment banks such as J.P. Morgan\) and companies \(leading global firms such as Johnson & Johnson\). 

 Building on techniques from ROIT and VyT research, Hesketh examined the HC reporting practices of the globe’s top 700 firms by revenue. Findings demonstrated that: HC disclosers perform better, and are disproportionately represented in the highest performing firms; that financial performance increases in step with HC reporting intensity; and that higher levels of HC disclosure on average secure higher levels of operating margin and retain higher levels of earnings to reinvest in the future returns of their businesses. Hesketh’s financial equation was endorsed by EPIC participants and enabled the initiative to establish the return on invested talent \(or ROIT\) for those firms with deeper and wider levels of HC reporting \(GBP3.17 for every GBP1 invested\) were nearly three times those with the lowest levels of HC disclosure \(GBP1.17\) \[R6\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 LUMS research has had an impact on professional bodies and services in the UK and the US, providing an impetus for debate about the value of HC disclosure, redefining best practice, influencing professional standards and codes of practice, and underpinning authoritative guidance. Hesketh and Fleetwood’s work has had an impact on public policy in the US, as an important lobbying tool to mandate for deeper HC disclosures and influencing policy decisions at the highest level, leading to a draft Bill before U.S. Congress to amend the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act to include all of the indicators represented in LUMS research. 

 In the words of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, LUMS work on VyT, “ *helped create a new human capital management framework to enable organisations to improve how they generate, report and analyse HR data to support strategic investment in people”* \[S1\]. 

 In February 2014, LUMS research was discussed at an All Parliamentary Group Roundtable in the House of Commons contributing to the future of management and leadership in the UK \[S2\]. Additional government\-funded research after the Roundtable \[S3\(a\)\] demonstrated human capital reporting increased by 18% in the UK in the immediate period after the publication of the VyT research report, with a second and more recent report highlighting how 3 of the 4 specific human capital elements prescribed by the original LUMS research –   wellbeing, employee turnover and training – had increased by 113%, 22% and 31% respectively, between 2013 and 2017 \[S3\(b\)\]. 

 Between 2016 to 2018, participation in EPIC accelerated the reach of LUMS research on a global scale. The participants publicly endorsing LUMS research represented the collective power and diversity of 31 firms across the entire investment chain, with USD30 trillion of assets under management and almost 2 million employees around the world. Hesketh’s original ROIT equation and VyT’s human capital disclosure items were incorporated into EPIC’s final recommendations and a Statement of Support was published in the Wall Street Journal and signed by CEOs of all participating firms \[S4\]. The research was formally acknowledged as central by the Chair of the Human Capital Deployment Group of EPIC, who noted that the findings of her group were, *“the most credible and tangible of the nine workstreams and the basis of this success is the work \[Lancaster\] did…* *\[Hesketh\] was central to this work continuing to move forward”* \[S5\]. 

 **Impact on policy and law** 

 The Chair of the EPIC Human Capital Deployment group, also a senior executive at Johnson & Johnson, added that LUMS research, “ *played a central role in shaping the thinking of EPIC and continuing the post\-EPIC impact of the research with the SEC and Congress”*’ \[S5\]. 

 The collective power of the EPIC participants triggered the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \(SEC\) into debating the inclusion, for the first time, of HC disclosures via its Investor Advisory Committee \(IAC\). LUMS research \[R1\], \[R5\], \[R6\] was pivotal to the deliberations \[S6\], and IAC members voted to take HC disclosure through to the SEC’s roundtable stage for consideration for inclusion. 

 Subsequent testimonies before the US House of Representatives made specific mention of Lancaster’s research. These came from a senior executive at AFL\-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the US \[S7\(a\)\]; and the Managing Investment Director, Board Governance & Sustainability, of California Public Employees’ Retirement System \(CalPERS\), who is also a member of the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee, who testified that, *“Our investment beliefs are grounded in an extensive review of evidence during CalPERS’ Sustainable Investment Research Initiative. This evidence has since been strengthened by the work of Dr Anthony Hesketh who presented to the CalPERS board yesterday in order to highlight the growing case for human capital disclosure by firms”* \[S7\(b\)\]. Hesketh’s research was also cited in a May 2020 joint letter from a Senator and a Congresswoman to the chairman of the SEC calling on them to improve their human capital management reporting requirements by updating Regulation S\-K 101\(c\)\(1\)\(xiii\) \[S7\(c\)\]. The SEC’s policy adoption and implementation process is recognised as being extremely rigorous and evidence\-based,  [embedding research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZk82ANEFY) directly into policy development, even more so than the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority \(FCA\). 

 On 26 August 2020, the SEC voted to change Regulation S\-K 101\(c\)\(1\)\(xiii\) which requires firms to disclose, *“a description of the registrant’s human capital resources to the extent such disclosures would be material to an understanding of the registrant’s business”* \[S8\]. 

 In October 2020, the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, observed how human capital management reporting has increased by 188% across the 214 companies in its portfolio \[S9\(a\)\], accompanied by releases by other ‘Big Four’ auditors Deloitte \[S9\(b\)\] and PwC \[S9\(c\)\] bringing the significance of the SEC’s ruling to the attention of their clients. 

##  Impact on professional services 

 Hesketh’s work has changed the attitudes of executives and regulators to enhancing the practices of HC measurement and disclosures. ‘Big Four’ accounting firms, Deloitte, followed by EY, have adopted the *Return On Invested Talent* \(or ROIT\) equation in their advice to their clients in meeting the formal requirements for measuring the value of human capital \[S10\(a\),\(b\)\] with coverage by CFO Magazine *,* with a readership of 44,000 senior financial decision\-makers every month, acknowledging the impact of LUMS research on the SEC’s original recognition of human capital \[S10\(c\)\]. Hesketh’s Valuing your Talent research, as well as the work of EPIC, are cited several times in the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s  [December 2020 revised Preliminary Framework on Human Capital and the SASB Standards **.**](https://www.sasb.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Human-Capital_Preliminary-Framework_2020-December_FINAL.pdf) LUMS research has also played an important role in a new Draft Bill, under consideration by U.S. Congress \[S11\(a\)\]. The wording of the bill, which is supported by the AFL\-CIO and is currently under consideration by the US House of Representatives. Although delayed due to COVID\-19, it includes specific items of human capital disclosure outlined in LUMS original Valuing your Talent and EPIC. In the words of the SEC’s guidance note prepared for the initial Congressional Hearing: *“because …\[human capital\] disclosures are not required and are thus only voluntary in the US, only 15% of S&P 500 firms do so \(Hesketh, 2020\). However, according to research from the Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism \(EPIC\), a project bringing together businesses with more than $1.5 trillion in market capitalization and asset managers managing more than $30 trillion, those U.S. companies that voluntarily disclose this information outperform those that do not and receive better returns on their investment in human capital \(Hesketh, 2020\)*” \[S11\(b\)\].

we find research that supports and informs business, entrepreneurialism, management as well as research informing public and private investments often for regional growth and development as well as policies aimed at improving productivity and firm growth in various forms. Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research. Several projects are also concerned with sustainable practices in business and entrepreneurialism for a greener economy and with enabling more socially responsible corporate practices.",24.71,24.0,45.32,28.1,29.08,24.27,42,17,237,84,111,18,298,95,129,24,0.1268668831168831,0.0756423761423761,0.0920454545454545,0.0926710929519918,0.0182196969696969,0.0764895598228931,1819

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Manchester’s Water Resource Group \(UMWRG\) has developed design approaches, models and open\-source software tools for system\-scale multi\-criteria assessment and optimisation of water resource interventions. 

 Partners including water companies \(Thames Water, Anglian Water\), regulators \(Ofwat, the Environment Agency\), and international funders \(World Bank, World Wildlife Fund\) have used these approaches and tools to improve their decision\-making. 

 UMWRG has influenced specific water infrastructure planning processes, system designs and investment decisions, including how national water transfer investments are selected for design by water companies and assessed by regulators in England and Wales. The work has informed **GBP9,000,000,000** of investment in water supply systems in London and the East of England, and England’s water industry regulators now recommend UMWRG approaches. Outside of the UK, UMWRG work influenced international funder’s assessment of hydropower projects, including contributing to pausing the International Finance Corporation’s participation in the Sounda Gorge Dam in the Republic of Congo.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 Traditionally water resource infrastructure is assessed *via* cost\-benefit analysis, considering each proposed investment individually. In water supply planning, the least\-financially\-costly package of infrastructure options is typically chosen. Since 2015, UMWRG has published a series of papers demonstrating an alternative approach for infrastructure investment assessment under future uncertainty. This approach tackles the infrastructure investment problem from a systems perspective, seeking to assess and optimise complex engineered\-natural\-human systems under uncertainty using multiple economic, engineering, ecological and social criteria. 

 UMWRG were the first to use multi\-criteria search\-based planning methods for UK water planning, and demonstrated that portfolios of water infrastructure options can be optimised for many stakeholder\-selected criteria, such as multi\-sector service levels, environmental performance and cost, greatly expanding the range of options available to investment planners **\[1\]**. Paper **\[1\]**, published in collaboration with Thames Water \(London’s water supply provider\) analysed the city’s infrastructure portfolio and is the first UK example of multi\-criteria optimised co\-design of a river basin and an urban water supply system. 

 Paper **\[2\]** showed for the first time how sophisticated the system\-scale multi\-objective infrastructure investment problem really is \( *i.e.*, each time you suggest an infrastructure investment package you must re\-optimise the management rules of the system for that specific combination of assets\). 

 Paper **\[3\]** considered the case of future uncertainty, *i.e.* how to simultaneously design for multi\-criteria analysis and seek ‘robust’ combinations of assets as well as consider a system’s performance over multiple plausible future scenarios simultaneously, rather than only accounting for historical data or a single future prediction. Paper **\[3\]**’s method also allows trading\-off of attributes relating to climate change resilience \( *e.g.* robustness to uncertainty, duration of failures\) with other conventional benefits \(like cost\). 

 In 2019, the Global Commission on Adaptation to Climate Change defined resilience as a combination of robustness in the face of an unknown future, and adaptability to it. UMWRG had been working for some time to develop a model\-assisted approach to enable resilience defined in this way. An award\-winning paper **\[4\]** achieved the optimisation of cost\-flexibility trade\-offs; this approach is referred to as ‘real options’, and aims to identify the value of seeking flexibility in infrastructure investment strategies.  This recognises the economic and social\-political value of being able to adapt infrastructure systems as new information on supply and demand progressively becomes available in the future. 

 Reference **\[5\]** \(‘Pywr’\) is UMWRG’s open\-source water resource management simulation code, under development since 2015. It has now become the preferred model for UK water companies upgrading their simulation software systems. Traditionally, to simulate many scenarios, each simulation starts at the initial time step and advances until the end of the simulated time\-horizon. This is slow because sometimes millions of scenario simulations are run with only small variations. In Pywr the time\-steps of each scenario are modelled together, such that only the new elements of any scenario are simulated. This results in a four\-fold increase in computational speed when simulating many futures, and has expanded the range of possibilities when analysing water resource systems. Pywr also allows users to develop customised metrics of system performance, so the simulator can be parameterised for any system globally. 

 Hydra Platform **\[6\]** is UMWRG’s open\-source data manager for networked resource models \( *e.g.* energy, transport, water, logistics, *etc.*\). Traditionally when engineers apply a generalised computer model to a specific system they use a model input file. Whilst simple, this can make maintaining large real\-world models unreliable and cumbersome. The Hydra Platform server manages datasets of large models reliably and securely on private servers or online, and can be linked to UMWRG’s ‘Polyvis’ multi\-criteria visualisation suite. UMWRG has used Hydra Platform and Polyvis internally and with partners for projects since 2015.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Impacts arising from the research described above fall into two categories. The first is influencing the water resource planning decisions made by water companies and regulators in England and Wales through new tools and approaches. The second is influencing major hydropower investment decisions by international development organisations. 

###  Water supply planning and regulation in England and Wales 

 Combined water resources and supply infrastructure networks at water company, regional or national scale are complex, often involving multiple stakeholders, region\-specific infrastructure, and competing priorities. Consequently, computer model\-based infrastructure for investment decision\-making has been the industry norm since 2002. Companies traditionally used a statutory least\-cost planning approach called the ‘Economics of Balancing Supply and Demand’ \(EBSD\), which optimises the schedule of cost\-effective supply or demand schemes. 

 In the last decade, UMWRG has worked with various stakeholders in the UK water industry, such as Thames Water, Anglian Water, the Environment Agency \(EA\), Ofwat \(the financial regulator\), regional groups such as Water Resources East \(WRE\) and Water Resources South East \(WRSE\), and industry bodies such as UK Water Industry Research \(UKWIR\). Based on research into resource modelling and decision making in water resources **\[1\-4, A\]**, UMWRG recommended three extensions to least\-cost EBSD modelling: to apply the ‘multi\-criteria paradigm’ \(multi\-criteria visualisation methods to explore how nearly\-least\-cost investment options perform on other non\-financial measures\) **\[A\]**; to use simulation\-based multi\-criteria optimisation **\[1, 3\]**; and to explicitly value flexibility and adaptability in infrastructure option optimisation **\[4, A\]**. 

####  Improving water regulators’ capabilities in scrutinising and directing water investments 

 UMWRG has had strong, ongoing collaborations with the EA to improve their capacity for guiding and scrutinising water resource investments from water companies. The EA’s 2017 and 2020 statutory guidance on water company water resource management plans **\[B\]**, which companies are legally obliged to follow, says that **companies should use the method co\-authored by UMWRG** **\[A, B\]**. For example, the 2017 guidance on technical methods to use states “ *You should identify your solution\(s\) using the most appropriate method for your company. You should refer to UKWIR \(2016\) WRMP 2019 Methods – decision making process guidance”*, which is the UoM\-authored guidance that includes UMWRG methods and tools **\[A\]**.   UMWRG’s emphasis on using adaptive planning methods continues to influence the EA, which has recommended the use of such methods for the first time in their July 2020 water company planning guidance document **\[B\]**. The EA’s regulatory power extends across England, and thus their guidance to water companies impacts upon all residents of England. 

 In 2018, UMWRG was approached by the EA to build a first national water supply\-demand planning model, designed to identify cost savings and resilience benefits achievable *via* an optimised mix of inter\-regional water transfers. This model was built with UMWRG’s Pywr model **\[5\]**, and is hosted online using our Hydra Platform **\[6\]**. The model’s results influenced the content of the 2020 National Framework EA\-led report **\[C, D\]**, leading the EA and Ofwat to increase their scrutiny of proposed water transfer plans by water companies. Using UMWRG models empowers the regulators by giving them the ability to perform their own optimisation of the national mix of water transfers, providing “ *crucial evidence*” **\[D\]** in scrutinising water companies’ proposals using their own preferred criteria. The EA characterises the tools provided by UMWRG thus: *“…a tool that provides regulators with a systematic national\-scale view of how different solutions can meet future water needs, is in the public interest*” **\[D\]**. 

 In March 2020 UMWRG was awarded the tender to build an extension of the National Framework supply\-demand model to allow the three water regulators \(Ofwat, the EA, and the Drinking Water Inspectorate\) to optimise and assess ‘baskets’ of water resource investment planning options **\[E\]**. This project finished in November 2020, and incorporates UMWRG’s multi\-criteria assessment methods into models for assessing water resource investment, built with the Pywr simulation software **\[E\]**. The value of our models was summarised by Ofwat: “ *In the 2020\-2025 period water companies in England and Wales will be investing **over £51 billion**. The tool being built with UMWRG provides regulators with a simple, systematic, country\-scale view, enabling the partnership to simulate and compare different combinations of water supply options. The output supports exploration of which solutions offer the best value in the public interest*” **\[E\]**. 

####  Changing investment planning practice at two major regional water company groups 

 The biggest change in English water planning in the last decade has been the growing influence of regional groupings of water companies \(in lieu of each company only making decisions on assets within its borders\). Two major English groups are WRE \(comprising Anglian Water, Affinity Water, Essex and Suffolk Water, Severn Trent, and Cambridge Water Company\), and WRSE \(comprising Affinity Water, Portsmouth Water, SES Water, South East Water, Southern Water and Thames Water\).  UMWRG began working with WRSE in 2010, and WRE in 2011. 

 WRSE uses an EBSD model built by UMWRG in collaboration with the EA, which WRSE described as “ *...key to our 2018 strategy for the South East*” **\[F\]**. WRSE commissioned a Pywr **\[5\]** model \(built by Atkins\) in 2018, and this was used in a 2019 UMWRG study of WRSE decision\-making robustness – WRSE described UMWRG as having made “ *a significant contribution to the planning of water resources and water supply provision in the populous South\-East of England*” **\[F\]**. The total value of asset investment that was considered in WRSE’s region of responsibility between August 2013 and July 2020 is **GBP7,000,000,000** **\[F\]**. These investment decisions affected some **19 million** **people’s water supply** in this region, as well as supplying industry and commerce which represent some 40% of the UK’s GDP **\[F\]**. WRSE’s Director described UMWRG’s contribution to their planning processes as “ *...instrumental in supporting strategic water infrastructure investment for the benefit of water security and resilience for both people and environment now and for future generations*” **\[F\]**. 

 WRE uses Pywr and, since 2019, uses an EBSD model designed by UMWRG, as well as analytical decision\-making approaches designed by UMWRG **\[1, 3, A, G\]**. These tools have greatly enhanced the ability of WRE to model planned infrastructure investments, accounting for important criteria that were previously absent **\[G\]**. WRE confirms, “ *Without UMWRG assistance* \[…\] *WRE would likely not have been as effective, transformational and influential as it has been in the 2014\-2020 period* \[…\] *we have been able to consider more decision factors than our previous models including environmental sustainability, water availability for the agri\-food sector and supply system performance including vulnerability to drought and climate change, reliability and resilience*” **\[G\]**. These UMWRG tools and methods have been used to inform **GBP1,300,000,000** of investment as part of Anglian Water’s statutory Water Resource Management Plan for 2019 \(WRMP19\), affecting the potable water supply of **6 million people** in England **\[G\]**. UMWRG tools are also being used by WRE to help its member companies plan for WRMP24 **\[G\]**. WRE is planning to develop two new public water supply reservoirs with an associated cost of **GBP1,700,000,000**, and have chosen to develop UMWRG tool applications to optimise multi\-sector value in these projects **\[G\]**. 

####  Increasing the breadth and quality of investment planning by Thames Water 

 Thames Water used UMWRG models and software **\[1, 5, 6\]** in their statutory WRMP19 **\[H\]**. WRMPs are exceptionally important in the water industry, as Thames Water explain: “… *developing an efficient, evidence\-based plan that represents best value\-for\-money investment is crucial to the business and its customers*” **\[H\]**. Thames Water’s plan evaluated and optimised options using eight criteria \(instead of cost only\), including environmental impact, inter\-generational equity, resilience, and carbon emissions **\[H\]**. This approach was introduced through UMWRG’s collaborations with Thames Water since 2012, including two funded PhD studentships, and Harou serving on Thames’ Expert Panel. As a result of their WRMP19 planning, Thames Water have committed to making **GBP750,000,000** of investments in infrastructure over the five\-year period of the plan, all of which has been shaped by UMWRG’s planning tools **\[H\]**. Thames Water supplies water to **15 million people in London and the Thames Valley** in South\-East England. All of these people have been affected by UMWRG’s influence on Thames’ investment planning. 

###  System\-scale design approaches for hydropower systems around the world 

 National ministries of water and/or energy, energy system regulators and river basin agencies influence how countries invest in hydropower projects. Individual hydropower projects are proposed by such organisations, evaluated by international funders with financial, environmental and social metrics, and their implementation is then decided on. Typically there is limited evaluation of how a proposed project will impact other existing or future hydropower dams, or how it will impact other water\-using sectors. Optimising hydropower investments to meet multiple sectoral and regional performance metrics is not common practice. Between 2015 and 2019, UMWRG developed new methods and tools for system\-scale optimisation of hydropower infrastructure investments **\[2\]**, promoted and applied them **\[A\]** to real hydropower systems internationally. 

####  Influencing policies and proposals from international funding agencies and NGOs 

 UMWRG has worked with international organisations that advocate for a more strategic approach to hydropower investment. This resulted in international policy documents **\[A\]** published jointly with organisations like the World Bank, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\), the World Wildlife Fund \(WWF\), The Nature Conservancy \(TNC\), and the Stimson Centre think\-tank. As an example, the WWF has collaborated with UMWRG on several major reports into water\-energy system design **\[I\]**, and has “ *integrated the work of UMWRG into our engagement with governments in Myanmar, Nepal, Zambia, among other countries*” **\[I\]**. 

####  Influencing specific hydropower investments 

 UMWRG has acted as a consultant to organisations such as the International Finance Corporation \(IFC\), producing reports on specific hydropower investment projects **\[J\]**. UMWRG produced a report \(in conjunction with TNC\) for the IFC on the **USD2,000,000,000** Sounda Gorge hydropower project \(Republic of Congo\) **\[A, J\]**. UMWRG recommended other, more strategic investments than those being considered by the IFC at the time, and the report demonstrated that the Sounda Gorge project would be difficult to complete. As the IFC state, “ *The study helped IFC refine its preferred concept for Sounda, whose implementation in compliance with IFC's Performance Standards would be challenging, technically complex, and involving major mitigation costs*” **\[J\]**. Consequently, the project has not gone ahead, and the IFC has paused its participation whilst the Government considers its options. Half of the estimated cost would have been paid for by the people of the Republic of Congo, and so UMWRG involvement has helped to prevent the miss\-spending of their money **\[J\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Centre for History \(CfH\) research has shown that, since the late eighteenth century, land inequality has been one of the leading causes of rural poverty and deprivation in the Scottish Highlands, leading to socially unjust emigration. CfH has built on these findings to inform contemporary public policy debate on land reform and community buyout schemes. This has had an impact on levels of community ownership, on statutory oversight by the Scottish Land Commission \(SLC\) and on extending community ‘right to buy’ to the whole of Scotland. The work has fed directly into the Scottish\-wide sense of land\-access injustices and, as reported by the  [Land Reform Review Group](https://www.gov.scot/publications/land-reform-review-group-final-report-land-scotland-common-good/pages/87/), has helped shape the Scottish Government’s realisation that addressing land inequalities is ‘ *fundamental to the wellbeing, economic success, environmental sustainability and social justice of the country’*. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Historic land issues have been at the heart of CfH research since Professor James Hunter established the Centre at the University of the Highlands & Islands \(UHI\) in 2005. Dr Elizabeth Ritchie’s appointment in 2009 and Dr Iain Robertson’s Readership in 2015 have helped to create new thinking and a centre of excellence on the subject. 

 The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw mass population movements away from the land in the Highlands and the concentration of land ownership into the hands of a few private owners. At one time, large sporting estates encompassed almost 60% of Scotland’s land area, and even today Scotland has the most concentrated pattern of private ownership in the world. According to the Scottish Government in 2014, half of the country’s private land was owned by 432 landowners. CfH research has documented the historic reaction from below to these inequities and the legacy of these protests \[3.1; 3.2\]. 

 In the last two decades of the twentieth century, both political and public opinion moved towards reforming historic land ownership patterns. CfH research has had impact in both arenas: directly in politics, while in the public arena the Centre has had significant impact on those who seek to raise public consciousness of land injustices in Scotland. Our work has shown that this shift in opinion was underpinned by a uniquely important event: the Assynt crofters’ purchase of their estate in north\-west Sutherland \[3.3\]. Land reform was given further impetus by Devolution and the election of the first Scottish National Party government, leading directly to the 2003 Land Reform \(Scotland\) Act. Hunter showed that Assynt was the catalyst for the growth of a mass movement from below – given power and legitimacy by land reform and operationalised by Highlands and Islands Enterprise – which has resulted in an ongoing and accelerating transfer of land ownership into community hands \[3.3\]. 

 These research projects reveal why community ownership has been received with such enthusiasm by ordinary people in the Highlands and Islands, drawing as it does on beliefs in communal rights to land that were formed as clan society emerged and endured, and this despite subsequent profound socio\-cultural change \[3.1; 3.2; 3.3\]. Two broad themes emerge from this land research: 

 Interconnections between land and people: CfH research has demonstrated a symbiotic, complex and contested relationship between land and people. Ritchie’s work on pre\-clearance livestock practices \[3.4\] and the distribution of Gaelic Schools \[3.5\] has raised important questions about popular perceptions of the Highlands as ‘wilderness’, exposing a wilful blindness to long histories of human population and ecological management. Robertson has demonstrated that this management amounts to a land consciousness which endures and connects nature and culture at a deep level and across time \[3.6\]. 

 Popular protest: Hunter’s work on land disturbances has been taken forward by Robertson to embrace cultural theory and an exploration of the clash between vernacular beliefs and the exploitative tenets of ‘improvement’ and political economy. Robertson’s research shows that popular protest was the reassertion, amongst the crofting tenantry, of a belief in community rights to land. He argues that land raids and other disturbances forced the Government to introduce a state\-sponsored land\-settlement scheme, the legacy of which is still apparent socially, culturally, and in the landscape today \[3.1; 3.2\]. Hunter has recently returned to this theme. His latest monograph, the first full\-length study of the 1847 food riots around the Moray and Highland coasts, has significantly deepened understanding of this last British manifestation of a centuries\-long form of local political negotiation \[\(3.7\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In November 2014, the First Minister set out the Scottish Government’s vision for a new round of land reform based on the belief that Scotland's land ‘must be an asset that benefits the many, not the few’. The Scottish Government was acting on the recommendations of the Land Reform Review Group, one of the authors of which was Professor James Hunter. CfH research on the interaction and interconnection between land and people and the enduring power of land consciousness has helped place land reform at the heart of community empowerment policies. This has been achieved through three broad streams of impact: \(1\) through policy; \(2\) on organisations; and \(3\) on influencers. 

 4.1 Informing policy: According to Kate Forbes, Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Member of the Scottish Parliament \(MSP\), Hunter has been widely acknowledged as ‘enormously influential when it comes to land reform policy\-making’ and the CfH has been able to ‘bridge that gap’ between contemporary policy and academic history \[5.1, pp.14 and 9\]. For the current census period these connections began with the 2013\-14 session of the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee which recognised that Scotland’s land reform policies were of relevance to the United Kingdom as a whole. Consequently, the Committee asked Hunter to co\-write a paper ‘to stimulate debate’ and to consider ‘one of the major yet underexplored areas of Scottish life: the ownership and control of the land itself’ \[5.2b, p.3\]. Hunter was chosen as an ‘eminently credible’ land reform advocate of ‘considerable public standing’ \[5.2a, p.1\]. The report boosted the land reform campaign to the extent that the Scottish Government felt ‘obliged’ to develop further policy proposals over which, as revealed in a 2015 SPICe report \(briefing papers for Scottish parliamentary business\) Hunter’s research had a shaping influence \[5.2c, pp.4\-6, 8 and 34\] 

 Almost immediately, Hunter was appointed vice\-chair of the SG’s Land Law Reform Group \(LLRG\) with a brief ‘to identify how land reform might enable more people in rural and urban Scotland to have a stake in the ownership, governance, management and use of land’ \[5.2d, p5\]. Its final report acknowledged the influence of Hunter’s research on its findings, a sentiment strongly echoed in an opinion piece for The Scotsman, written at the time by Lesley Riddoch – the paper’s then Deputy Editor. She saw in the report ‘measures that Jim Hunter was advocating’ \[5.3\]. The report led to many policy initiatives and helped shift the SG’s approach to rural regeneration towards ‘an organic, bottom\-up, people\-centred process’ \[5.4, p8\]. As Forbes asserts, CfH research demonstrated that ‘you can trace back the problems we face today to the decisions that were taken two hundred, three hundred years ago’ \[5.1, p.14\]. 

 The most significant piece of legislation resulting from the LLRG recommendations was the Community Employment \(Scotland\) Act of 2015. As reported in the SPICe briefing paper \[5.2c\], the Act explicitly envisaged land reform as a key element in the SGs drive to further empower local communities through extending the community ‘right to buy’ to all Scotland. Thereby making the direct connection between CfH research \[3.3\] and national changes in Scottish land ownership and community\-led, asset\-based development. 

 In 2015, the 1 Million Acre Short Life Working Group \(SLWG\) \[5.4\] was tasked with developing strategy to achieve the Scottish Government’s new target of one million acres in community ownership by 2020. Some of the key evidence SLWG used to demonstrate the diverse psychological and material benefits that flow from community ownership came directly from Hunter’s research. He showed how community ownership creates diversification of economic activities, leading to increased turnover and staffing levels, thereby changing ‘people’s perceptions … and develop\[ing\] new aspirations’ \[5.4, p9\]. 

 The SLWG’s final report used research evidence presented in Hunter’s paper for the Scottish Affairs Committee and explicitly linked ‘vulnerability, hunger and poverty’ to inadequate and insecure tenure rights \[5.4, p14\], as firmly demonstrated by CfH research. Responding to this, the Land Reform \(Scotland\) Act in 2016 established the Scottish Land Commission on the principle ‘that if Scotland was really to make the most of its land then it would need \[a\] dedicated statutory organisation that works to improve the potential for land, both urban and rural, to contribute to the success and development of Scotland’s people and communities. \[5.5a pp.3\-4\]. Moreover, in acknowledging the ‘highly significant … historical context … in both practical and political terms’ for their work, the Chair of the Commission recognised the ongoing importance of CfH research into the relationship between land and people to realising greater public recognition of such contexts \[5.5b\]. 

 4.2 Inspiring organisations: Since 2016 CfH researchers have moved into a closer working relationship with Community Land Scotland, the umbrella organisation for the community buyout movement. CLS commissioned papers by CfH researchers to stimulate conversation and debate around aspects of land consciousness that had not yet entered public discourse. Built around \[3.3\] and \[3.4\], papers by Ritchie and Hunter informed and shaped CLS policy positions on ‘wild land’ and ‘rewilding’, persuading the organisation that ‘wilderness’ is partly a cultural construct associated with the Romantic view of landscape. This resulted in CLS leading ‘a national conversation’ around the repopulation of the Highlands in contradistinction to ‘rewilding’ \[5.6\]. 

 Further CfH research into historic land reform has persuaded National Records of Scotland \(NRS\) to preserve an archive of 1920s land settlement schemes. The archive came under threat of destruction in 2019, with only the depth of Robertson’s research \[3.1; 3.2; 3.6\] persuading the Corporate Records Manager of the Scottish Government that these records ‘are clearly of enduring value going forward’ and will be ‘marked for preservation and passed to NRS at an appropriate future date’ \[5.7a\]. 

 This relationship CfH between historic and contemporary events is embedded in every aspect of CfH land research with Hunter, for instance, revealing the central role Highlands and Islands Enterprise \(HIE\) played in the embryonic community buyout movement \[3.3\]. From this perspective and position of strength, when the Scottish Government planned to abolish the HIE board, it was Hunter who led the oppositional campaign, drawing on his ‘rare combination of … historical research and being able to speak into the current climate’ \[5.1, p. 14\]. As an MSP, Kate Forbes affirms this combination is ‘very helpful to someone like me’ \[5.1, pp. 9\] with Hunter being quoted and referred to by several MSPs during the Scottish Parliament debate on HIE’s future in January 2017 \[5.8a\]. Later that month, Hunter was invited to meet with Keith Brown, MSP, Economics Minister in the Scottish Government. The Government changed its declared policy and the board of HIE was retained. As Sandra Holmes, HIE’s Head of Community Assets declares: ‘shining a light’ on the key historic contributions of HIE revealed ‘that many of the issues of yesterday are ever present’ \[5.8b\]. 

 4.3 Influencing the influencers: The long history of land consciousness in the Highlands demonstrated in CfH research has been inspirational to those campaigning for further land reform today on a number of levels. Alastair McIntosh, an internationally\-recognised human ecologist, activist and writer, stated in his foreword to the paperback edition of The Other Side of Sorrow \(2014\) that Hunter’s research ‘moved me, moved me on, and helped me better to understand myself. In that I know that I was not alone’’ \[5.9c p.xix\]. McIntosh, one of the catalysts of the community buyout movement believes that ‘James Hunter’s history and historiography was pivotal to those of us who pioneered modern Scottish land reform. It legitimised our endeavours, laying the scholarly foundations for an emergent land consciousness’ in the wider public realm \[5.9b\]. 

 The impact of CfH research has been further acknowledged by another influential land reform activist, Mairi McFadyen. It has been, she asserts, a profound influence upon her activism and advocacy and she draws CfH research into every consciousness\-raising workshop she runs, whether with politicians, activists, or the public. She describes Hunter and Robertson’s land research as a touchstone: ‘I have come back to it again and again, especially since I have been doing more work around climate change … for me, underpinning everything, every social justice issue … is the question of land’ \[5.10a, p.8\]. Qualitative evaluation of her workshops confirms that delegates find them to be ‘inspiring … a great initiation to raise awareness … a great opportunity to enjoy music and learn about political issues at the same time … awareness raising being inspired to look at landscape’ \[5.10b\]. 

 Robertson’s research has helped the West Harris Trust make similar connections around land consciousness. This began with a conference Robertson initiated with community groups on the island of Lewis to celebrate the impact and legacy of the 1919 Land Settlement \(Scotland\) Act. As a direct consequence, Robertson was commissioned by community landowner the West Harris Trust to train its members to research the history of land consciousness on their estate, ‘to raise awareness and understanding’, and to help recognise its legacy by writing the text for a celebratory panel to be displayed at the Trust’s Community Enterprise Centre \[5.7b\]. 

 Legacies of land consciousness extend into the economic realm. On Barra, in the Outer Hebrides, CfH research has directly inspired the development of a profitable walking tour business. Tours seek to ‘tell the story of the crofters and cottars, the toiling class’. The owner says this research was “the first ... I had read ... that did not allow the landlords the economic ‘get out of jail free’ card’ \[5.11\]. 

 Summing up CfH’s contribution to activism, the land campaigner and writer Lesley Riddoch asserts that CfH research has ‘coloured in the Highlands, from what was previously a grudge match, into something much more subtle ... it is not an exaggeration to say that you have re\-created the Highlands” \[5.3b, p.10\]. This is a perception shared by Kate Forbes, MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Finance, who states that the Centre’s research legitimises “what people were already doing informally as an act of rebellion or radicalism” \[5.1, p. 16\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Adrian Heathfield’s curation of *Doing Time*, the Taiwan Pavilion at the 57<sup>th</sup> Venice Biennale, attended by 101,805 international spectators, has had a significant influence on museum\-based global curatorial practice with performance archives. Specifically, Heathfield’s research has informed public understanding of Teching Hsieh’s oeuvre, performance art histories and their personal and cultural resonances. It has enhanced the artist’s standing, interpretation and value within art professional, museum and art market contexts. Heathfield’s research has also extended the global influence of diasporic Taiwanese artistic practices, the advancement of cultural exchange, and the cultural diversification of art world understandings of performance art histories, whilst increasing the Taipei Fine Arts Museum’s \(TFAM\) global renown, curatorial practice and pavilion commissioning.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Heathfield was appointed Professor of Performance and Visual Culture in 2007. At this time, he began research on the under\-discussed Taiwanese\-American artist Tehching Hsieh, resulting in his 2009 monograph \( **R1**\) on and with the artist, expanded in a Chinese translation \(2012\) and reprinted in paperback \(2015\). This volume made a significant contribution to performance art history, recovering and repositioning Hsieh’s work in relation to histories of conceptual and body art, and marking its development of ‘durational aesthetics’, a term coined by Heathfield, and now taken up broadly in art discourse. Heathfield’s widely disseminated scholarship on contemporary and historical live art, exemplified in his 2012 anthology co\-edited with Amelia Jones \( **R2**\), has influentially returned to questions of eventhood and documentation, performativity and archives, performance re\-dos and art historical narration. Consequent insights were essential to the conception and realisation of Heathfield’s curatorial strategies in the exhibition and their impact upon distinct beneficiaries: diverse art professionals, institutions, and broader art publics. 

 Moreover, practices of public engagement and knowledge exchange in the four\-year AHRC funded *Performance Matters* creative research project \( **R3**\) mounted serial examinations of the cultural value of performance, its increasing assimilation within art institutions, and questioned its popular perception and historicisation: discursive terrains in which *Doing Time* then directly and practically intervened. A 2014 European Commission award \( **R4**\) held over three years enabled Heathfield to extend his discursive work into a singular practical study of immaterial art making processes, their presentation and status within museums. Two specific curations – *Afterlives* at Museum of Modern Art, New York, and *Ghost Telephone* at Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney – advanced consideration of the performativity of archival materials, and the handling, protocols, and problematics of durational performance in museums. Preliminary research for *Doing Time* \( **R5**\) was conducted through *Curating the Ephemeral* \( **R4**\). Textual outputs from this project \( **R6**\) examined performance’s resistances to institutional containment and informed Heathfield’s curatorial tactics around the life of archival materials. 

 Conducted over two years in the USA, Italy and Taiwan, exhibition research involved intensive collaboration with the artist, unearthing new facts around early aesthetic experiments in Taipei. The resultant creation and showing of a site\-specific redo for film of a lost performance profoundly altered the history of Hsieh’s oeuvre. By re\-situating the beginnings of Hsieh’s aesthetics in Taiwan, the curation questioned the cultural belonging of the work, impacting the region’s artistic heritage. Heathfield wrote and co\-directed a documentary film on Hsieh’s outdoor work stressing its resonation with issues of migrant life, homelessness, and their policing. The first combined exhibition of two major performance\-installations mounted a highly affective discourse on the nature of bare existence, its relation to systems of power, to time and to nature. Extending public debate, Heathfield convened two livestreamed web\-archived talks: dynamic reflections on the exhibition that engaged leading figures from urban studies, anthropology, philosophy, performance theory and the visual arts.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Heathfield’s singular curatorial practice\-research on a sustained high\-profile exhibition for Taiwan in a world\-leading art biennale has produced tangible impacts of global scope for distinct beneficiaries. Detailed knowledge of Hsieh’s oeuvre \( **R1**\) and of late twentieth\-century art practices \( **R2**\), in combination with Heathfield’s sophisticated understanding of the politics of curatorial practice \( **R3**, **R4**, **R6**\) resulted in his curatorship of *Doing Time* \( **IMP1**\) and dynamically facilitated its impacts. National pavilion curations are prestigious positions, selected in this case by a committee of renowned Taiwanese cultural figures. The exhibition \( **R5**\) was the outcome of intensive collaborations with the artist and 26 TFAM staff on the principles, content and form of the curation. 

 Heathfield’s decisions to re\-stage Hsieh’s previously unseen early works, alongside the unprecedented presentation of two major performance\-installations \( **R5**\) deepened public understanding of the artist’s oeuvre, of performance histories and their cultural resonances. Exceeding all previous attendance for a Taiwan Pavilion, the exhibition reached a global audience of 101,805 visitors from 98 countries across 6 continents. An unusually large visitor survey \( **IMP2**\), securing qualitative responses from 4% of attendees, evidences the transformation of public perceptions of the artist, performance art and its cultural and personal value. Of 4,149 respondents: 91.1% reported enhanced understanding of Hsieh’s works; 84.2% asserted a changed or deepened understanding of performance art; and 89.2% felt the artworks’ importance in their own experience of life and time \( **IMP3**\). Changes to spectators’ cultural perceptions are a frequently repeated content in hundreds of visitor comments: for instance, noting the exhibition ‘Has changed my perspective of time and freedom forever’, or has ‘exposed to me… that art is life and life is art’ \( **IMP4**\). 

 Catalogue distribution to 4,953 attendees \( **IMP2**\), press interviews by Heathfield, alongside engagement events before and after the exhibition in Taipei, Hong Kong, Venice, Nottingham, Bilbao, Copenhagen, Singapore, Porto, and London, extended public, professional and critical reception with over 830 attendees \( **IMP5**\). Subsequent amplifications of public impact continued through widespread distribution of Heathfield’s exhibited film \( **IMP5**\). 

 Broad press coverage included rating in the top ten Biennale exhibitions in *Frieze Critics Guide*, *The New York Times*, Royal Academy of Arts, MutualArt, *Culture Trip* and *Tatler Hong Kong*. Positive reviews were received in 37 art and general press outlets, with *The* *New York Times* noting that, ‘The Biennale’s two\-year cycle takes on new weight in the Taiwanese pavilion… Hsieh’s focus is not the endurance or the deprivation that is so evident in his images but instead the use of time as a medium.’ Leading online culture magazine, *Hyperallergic* designated *Doing Time*, ‘One of the most energizing and provocative contributions to the 2017 Venice Biennale’. *Culture Trip* called the exhibition, ‘impressive… utterly astounding’, whilst *The Guardian* noted this was, ‘\[Hsieh’s\] most extensive retrospective yet… his most fascinating and thought\-provoking works’ \( **IMP6**\). 

 *Doing Time*’s impact upon cultural understandings of Hsieh’s oeuvre, his standing and value within art history and consequently within art professional, museum and art market arenas has transformed his career. Hsieh notes Heathfield’s ‘writing, framing and curating… at Venice has presented my work to a much bigger public’, generating considerable popular discourse. The ‘successful show’, Hsieh states, ‘has made the greatest impact on the reception of my work in the art world’ and has caused ‘the collection of my work by individual collectors and art institutions \[to\] grow’ \( **IMP7**\). 

 As the first non\-Taiwanese pavilion curator \( **IMP1**\), Heathfield’s work with an émigré artist and his curation’s emphasis on grounding, belonging and itinerancy contributed to art world appreciation of Taiwanese diasporic culture and artistic practices \( **IMP1**, **IMP7**\). The assertion of the value of a neglected but key figure in its art history was strategically significant for the Taiwanese government. The presence and speech of the Minister of Culture at the opening ceremony evidence the research’s contributions to the advancement of cultural exchange, to diversity in the art world and popular art historical perception \( **IMP8**\). 

 *Doing Time*’s high\-quality curation enhanced TFAM’s regional and global renown. With regard to pavilion commissions, the Museum’s Director noted how Heathfield, ‘established a successful model through this inaugural international partnership’. By curating ‘a cosmopolitan context’, Heathfield, ‘initiated a mechanism for the Taiwan Pavilion to talk to the international community and promote interaction and involvement between artistic communities in Taiwan’. The exhibition substantially furthered the Museum’s aim of ‘building’ international renown for ‘Taiwanese contemporary art history’ \( **IMP1**\). Asian Contemporary Art recognised Heathfield and the museum’s collaboration with the 2017 award for ‘Best Curatorial Team of the Year’. The jury statement recognised the exhibition’s sophisticated narration of Hsieh’s artistic journey: ‘this… exhibition was not built around the artwork as with conventional exhibitions, but instead used a variety of literature and objects that marked the progress of Hsieh’s forty years of creation’ \( **IMP9**\). 

 Heathfield’s ‘radical and ground breaking’ curation has influenced international exhibition strategies in relation to performance art practices, ‘particularly how he brought Tehching Hsieh’s unrealised work to life and turned an archive into a living body of work’. This research has made a significant contribution to professional discourse on the museum display of performance, whilst enacting ‘a cultural diversification of the global figures in performance history’, as evidenced in the testimony of a leading European museum director \( **IMP10**\).

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research from the University of Manchester \(UoM\)’s Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research \(Tyndall\-Manchester\) identified the failure of greenhouse gas emissions mitigation policies in the shipping and aviation sectors to align with the Paris Agreement climate targets. The research characterised the impact of this failure, and published decarbonisation pathways that have engaged international, national and local policy and industry stakeholders and influenced debate at multiple scales. 

 Global CO<sub>2</sub> targets have now been set by the International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\), through the adoption of resolution MEPC.304\(72\) as a direct result of Tyndall\-Manchester research. In the aviation sector, Tyndall\-Manchester research quantified the extent of technical improvement possible, noting the contradiction between expected aviation emissions growth with the Paris Agreement targets. The Heathrow third runway expansion policy passed by the UK Government was rejected at judicial review because of this inconsistency. The Manchester Climate Change Framework has adopted aviation climate policies because of Tyndall\-Manchester input. This has reduced investment and policy risk for business and local government by recognising this source of emissions in subsequent spatial and economic planning, avoiding the need for late, costly, reactive responses.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 The research on the shipping and aviation sectors generated three key findings that underpin the impact. 

 Paper **\[1\]** identified that omitting international aviation and shipping from the UN’s climate change target framework is a major risk to the 2 °C goal because of the significant climate impact of these emissions. Paper **\[2\]** provided specific insights into the structure and capabilities of the shipping sector, and showed that there are many technical options for decarbonising shipping. For instance, hull and propeller redesign, in combination with speed changes, fuel switching to bioenergy or hydrogen, and wind assistance. It also showed that setting an ambitious target for the shipping industry is not as high risk as it is for aviation. Paper **\[3\]** then quantified the implications of the Paris Agreement mitigation targets for international shipping by relating the IPCC AR5 Synthesis report cumulative emissions budget findings with fleet efficiency trajectories from the reference scenarios of the Third IMO GHG \[Greenhouse Gas\] Study \(2014\), demonstrating the necessity of urgent CO<sub>2</sub> targets. 

 **Finding 1:** **The shipping sector has a similar greenhouse gas emissions reduction challenge as aviation, but with greater potential for technical solutions. It is feasible and necessary to set ambitious CO<sub>2</sub> targets as a matter of urgency.** 

 A sequence of EPSRC funded interdisciplinary projects, conducted by the Tyndall\-Manchester team, explored the challenge of decarbonising international transport. They calculated the expected future emission from the aviation sector following workshops and interviews with industry to assess technical mitigation potential **\[4\]**. The finding of expected rates of emissions increase indicated that demand management and emissions trading deserved greater research and policy attention. The research considered voluntary carbon trading and concluded that this was unlikely to address the matter either. The “tonnes of carbon” included in these trading systems were found not to be physical tonnes of material, and so carbon trading for emissions growth would likely increase the extent of climate change. The research quantified the risk to UK climate change targets if airport expansion continues and demonstrated that as for shipping, leaving aviation outside of the UN’s climate change target framework is a major risk to the 2 °C goal **\[1, 4\]**. 

 **Finding 2: **The aviation sector currently produces 10% of UK CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and this is likely to increase to levels incompatible with UK and global CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation targets. Technical mitigation potential to cut CO<sub>2</sub> is less than the necessary rate of reduction.** 

 Research funded by the North West Regional Development Agency explored the UK regional distribution of aviation emissions, developing the first methodology for sub\-national apportionment for international aviation emissions **\[5\]**. Further funded work identified the implications of current UK government aviation emissions projections for national carbon budgets and the constraints they place on other sectors **\[6\]**. Unachievable emission reduction rates, greater than 20% *per annum*, were found to be required from the rest of the economy if aviation grows at the rate forecast by the UK’s Department for Transport \(DfT\) and if national climate policy is aligned with the UN Paris Agreement. 

 **Finding 3: **If the aviation sector takes a disproportionate share of future emissions, then the pressure on other sectors may inhibit regional development or jeopardise the overall climate objective.**

##  4. Details of the impact 

###  Context 

 Greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation and shipping are largely unregulated. Tyndall\-Manchester research in the period 2003–2007 overturned the prevailing orthodoxy in national climate change mitigation policy that regarded international shipping and aviation as unproblematic, minor sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policy developments followed. The global nature of climate change necessitates a comprehensive emission mitigation framework, since partial coverage will be both physically ineffective and economically inefficient increasing the cost to society. If shipping and aviation are excluded from mitigation efforts then other emitting sectors will be required to go further by, for instance, reducing their economic activity or investing in more costly abatement technology, or suffer damages due to greater climate change impacts. 

###  Pathways to Impact – Shipping 

 In 2009, the need for significant and meaningful CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation targets in the shipping sector was raised with the UK’s Environmental Audit Committee through oral evidence given by Larkin \(then Bows\). Published research papers **\[1, 2, 3\]** and stakeholder engagement at industry and policy events further highlighted the scale of the challenge. This culminated in a submission and oral presentation on carbon budgets made by Larkin and Smith \(UCL\) to the International Maritime Organisation at their Marine Environmental Protection Committee meeting MEPC68 in summer 2015. Smith spoke predominantly about techno\-economic potential in the sector, Larkin focussing on emissions consequences. 

 Tyndall\-Manchester’s research has led the debates that informed European policy decisions and contributed to global scale impact. The European Commission Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety \(ENVI\) in 2016 proposed a new chapter to Directive 2003/87/EC that would include shipping within its Emissions Trading Scheme if not otherwise regulated. This put pressure on the IMO **\[A\]**. This decision was informed by European Commission Policy Department A for the ENVI Committee report **\[A\]** citing paper **\[1\]** for evidence around targets for aviation and shipping. The international NGO  [Global Commission on the Economy and Climate](http://newclimateeconomy.net/about/members-global-commission/), led by the former President of Mexico Felipe Calderon, produced a report **\[B\]** which cites Tyndall\-Manchester’s paper’s ‘50% cut in CO<sub>2</sub> by 2050’, and their *Nature Climate Change* commentary **\[2\]**, with a recommendation that “ *the IMO adopts a global emission reduction target for international shipping…in keeping with 2 °C”*. 

 Larkin spoke prominently on shipping at both the 2015 and 2017 UN international climate negotiations \(COP21 and COP23\), including at an official EU side event alongside Tony De Brum from the Marshall Islands – the leader of the High Ambition Coalition **\[C\]**. At COP21, sector\-specific NGOs cited Tyndall\-Manchester’s research in applying pressure to civil servants and political representatives **\[D\]** and by 2017, there was pressure also from *within* the industry fearing that if IMO did not set a target, the EU would do so instead. The link between UoM’s research and these ongoing policy changes is evidenced by citations of research finding 2 \(above\) in EU **\[A\]**, Pacific Nations’ policy development background documents **\[E\]**, and IMO internal newsletters **\[F\]** at relevant points in time. 

###  Impact – Shipping 

 The UN body responsible for regulating shipping, the International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\), adopted ambitious climate change targets at the MEPC72 meeting in April 2018 with preceding discourse influenced directly by Tyndall\-Manchester research **\[D, G\]**. The IMO estimate the resulting emissions reduction to be between 800 and 2,400 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2050, which is greater than preventing all emissions from fossil fuels currently burnt in Germany. The international NGO Transport & Environment’s Campaign Director summarises UoM’s research and evidence contributions, saying, “ *…this work was instrumental in the IMO adopting global emissions reduction targets for international shipping*” **\[D\]**. 

 Action to reduce emissions from shipping is necessary for comprehensive climate change mitigation. If this sector is excluded from obligations applicable to other sectors, then it is much less likely that global warming will be limited to 1.5 °C;  the IPCC identify that up to several hundred million people would be exposed to additional climate related risks and poverty by 2050 compared to 2 °C \(IPCC 2018 SPM B5.1\). The UK Chamber of Shipping’s Director of Policy emphasised the importance of the IMO’s adoption of these targets, saying, “ *This is not only vital work for our industry but also critical in helping to ensure shipping meets its climate change obligations which will be key to the wider global strategy*” **\[G\]**. The reach of Tyndall\-Manchester’s impact on the shipping sector is global due to the adoption of an international 2050 emissions reduction target by the IMO **\[G\]**. 

###  Pathways to Impact – Aviation 

 Based on research findings 2 and 3 \(above\), Broderick and Larkin submitted evidence to the DfT development of the 2019 Aviation White Paper and an expert statement to the judicial review of the approval for the development of plans for a new runway at Heathrow Airport \(Airports National Policy Statement \(ANPS\) 2018\) **\[H\]**. 

 Broderick and colleagues also held a series of workshops \(November 2017 to March 2018\) with the Assistant Director \(Environment\) of Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\), representatives of Manchester Airport Group and other stakeholders. The conclusions from these workshops were widely circulated in a report advising GMCA to account for the impact of international transport within their own climate change mitigation framework. Prior to this work, aviation had been considered outside of the city scale, however Tyndall\-Manchester’s research showed that DfT national aviation forecasts resulted in too high a mitigation burden for the GM city\-region. The researchers proposed a new emissions pathway for aviation that was presented to the GMCA Low Carbon Hub board, and as a keynote presentation at Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham’s Green Summit in March 2018. This was followed up with further research and workshops in late 2019 and early 2020 culminating in a report and presentations to Manchester Climate Change Partnership. 

###  Impact – Aviation 

 The reach of the impact on UK aviation policy is at two levels. The first level is the acknowledgement of the comparative scale of DfT forecasts in relation to Paris Agreement carbon budgets. This was particularly highlighted in relation to Heathrow expansion. Following Larkin’s statement **\[H\]**, during the Judicial Review of the ANPS \(2018\), the Court of Appeal in February 2020 ruled that the Government’s ANPS was unlawful because it failed to take into account the UK’s commitment to the Paris Agreement. As of February 2021, Heathrow Airport acknowledge they have to prove expansion is compatible with the Paris Agreement before construction could being. 

 The second impact is at the city\-regional level where the research has helped the City of Manchester to understand the implications of unfettered aviation expansion for their own emissions reductions plans. Manchester City Council, which owns a controlling stake \(35%\) of Manchester Airport, formally endorsed the draft Manchester Zero Carbon Framework \(2020\-38\) in March 2019, which contains analysis that is dependent upon Tyndall\-Manchester’s aviation research **\[I\]**. Subsequently \(Nov 2019\) Manchester Climate Change Agency \(MCCA\) commissioned the Tyndall\-Manchester research team to report on policy options for monitoring and managing emissions from Manchester Airport. Without this research MCCA would not have communicated the importance of aviation emissions at city scale to senior policy makers and stakeholders and achieved the formal adoption of targets and actions for aviation within the city’s Climate Change Framework **\[J\]**. The latest Manchester Climate Change Framework 2020\-25 therefore includes new aviation emissions objectives and was subsequently endorsed by Manchester City Council in March 2020, formally establishing it as the city’s climate change strategy.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research by the University of Exeter \(UoE\) has established at the molecular level why managed bee pollinators, worth more than £650 million to the UK economy each year, are very sensitive to certain pesticides, such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, but highly tolerant to others. This knowledge has been **translated into tools** \(the BeeSafe toolkit\) which have been used by Bayer, a world\-leading agrochemical company, to: \(1\) **rapidly screen for and accelerate the development of new insecticides that have low toxicity to bees**; \(2\) **predict and avoid harmful pesticide\-pesticide interactions**; and \(3\) **support registration of specific pesticide combinations** that are safe for bees. The BeeSafe toolkit was integral to Bayer receiving **regulatory approval for a new insecticide** in Germany **with benefits to pollinators and oilseed rape production**. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Pesticides play a key role in agriculture by controlling plant pests and diseases and securing quality and yield in plant production. However, there are growing concerns over the effects of plant protection products on the environment and non\-target organisms such as bee pollinators. There is thus an urgent need to devise strategies to minimise harm from existing pesticides and develop new compounds that show high efficacy against crop pests but low toxicity to non\-target beneficial insects such as bees. Research by the UoE has met this challenge by fundamentally advancing our understanding of the molecular determinants of bee sensitivity to insecticides and, in partnership with industry, leveraging this knowledge to develop bee\-safe compounds. 

 Previous work has shown that bees can exhibit profound differences in their sensitivity to different members of <ins>the same</ins> insecticide class. For example, honey bees \( *Apis mellifera*\) are >1000\-fold less sensitive to the neonicotinoid thiacloprid than the neonicotinoid imidacloprid in acute insecticide contact bioassays, with the former classified as ‘highly toxic’ but the latter categorised as ‘practically non\-toxic’ according to the official categories of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Understanding the molecular basis of this differential sensitivity is key to designing insecticides that have low toxicity to bees but retain efficacy against pest insects. 

 From 2016 to the present Chris Bass, Professor of Applied Entomology at Exeter, secured £1.5M funding from industry \(Bayer AG\) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council \(BBSRC\) to address this knowledge gap \(see section 3\). The research initially focussed on neonicotinoid insecticides and demonstrated that differential sensitivity to different neonicotinoids within the same class are also observed in other social bees such as bumblebees \( *Bombus terrestris*\) and solitary bees such as the red mason bee \( *Osmia bicornis*\). We hypothesised that the metabolic systems used by bees to detoxify the natural toxins encountered in their environment may be recruited to protect honey bees and bumblebees against certain synthetic insecticides. To investigate this we performed the most comprehensive functional characterisation of the primary bee phase I detoxification enzymes \(P450s\) ever conducted. The results revealed that in both honey bees and bumblebees, as well as in red mason bees, just one specific subfamily of P450s determine their sensitivity to neonicotionoids **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**. These enzymes metabolise *N*\-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids with very high efficiency but show very limited activity against *N*\-nitroguanidine neonicotinoids, explaining the differences in bee sensitivity to these compounds. Thus, as in humans where just a handful of the 57 functional P450s metabolise xenobiotics, important managed bee species possess key enzymes responsible for the biotransformation of toxins that are critically important in defining their sensitivity to pesticides. This is important as it means that simply by examining the capacity of this small number of P450 enzymes to metabolise \(or be inhibited by\) pesticides we can predict the pharmacological and toxicological outcomes of pesticide use on bee pollinators. Furthermore, it has provided underpinning data and tools to facilitate the development of new bee\-safe compounds. Specifically, a key outcome of the research was the creation of a ‘BeeSafe’ toolkit. 

 This toolkit comprises two components. Firstly, a panel of purified bee P450 enzymes that we obtained from expressing bee P450 genes in an insect cell line in the laboratory. For each P450 enzyme we have identified a fluorescent model substrate that can be used to measure P450 activity in simple fluorescent assays **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. Together the enzymes and model substrates can be used in high\-throughput screens of pesticides to examine if the P450 can metabolise the test compound \(providing an early indication of its potential toxicity to bees and a predictor of a compound's likely development success\). Secondly, we have created a series of transgenic fruit fly \(Drosophila\) lines each expressing a different bee P450 **\[3.4\]**. These genetically modified Drosophila lines are now resistant to the same pesticides as the native bee species, and their sensitivity to novel pesticides or pesticide combinations can be examined using simple pesticide bioassays. These lines have been made publicly available to facilitate research by scientists in both industry and academia \(see section 4\). Together, this toolkit can be used as a valuable screening tool to fast\-track the development of new bee\-safe insecticides \(see section 4\). They can also be used to identify negative pesticide\-pesticide interactions. For example, to identify if a compound acts as an inhibitor of these key bee P450s, thus sensitising bees to other pesticides that are usually non\-toxic **\[3.1,3.2\]**. This is useful as different pesticides are often co\-applied to crops by growers \(see section 4\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Research by the UoE has led to a step change in how insecticides are being developed and deployed by industry partners, such as Bayer \(and more recently Syngenta\), to: \(1\) rapidly screen for and develop new insecticides that have low toxicity to bees; \(2\) predict and avoid harmful pesticide\-pesticide interactions; and \(3\) support the registration of specific pesticide combinations that are safe for bees. 

 Our BeeSafe toolkit **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.4\]** has met the urgent need for tools that can aid in the development process, and identify candidate insecticides with improved environmental and toxicological profiles \(and those that do not have these attributes\) at an early stage, by\-passing the need to screen upward of 140,000 compounds per product. Before the availability of these tools, the safety of candidate insecticides was exclusively assessed by tests using live *A. mellifera*, *B. terrestris* and solitary bees such as *O. bicornis*. However, live bioassays on bees are expensive and time\-consuming to perform, costing $10\-$30K per test compound, dependent on bee species **\[5.1\]**. Furthermore, it is only possible to screen honey bees and solitary species for a few months of the year. In contrast, the BeeSafe toolkit is inexpensive and rapid to use, and can be employed year\-round. 

 **Rapid development of novel bee\-safe insecticides** 

 Pesticides remain an important component of modern agriculture with the global pesticide market worth $75 billion in 2017. Bayer AG's market cap as of October 26, 2018, was $70.34 billion, while its CropScience division produces pesticides for commercial and consumer uses, with pesticide sales of €9.57 billion in 2017, making them the largest Agrochemical company in the world \(Statista, 2019\). However, increased costs associated with a sharp escalation in the number of compounds that need to be screened/tested has led to a significant decline in the number of research\-based companies in the US and Europe involved in the discovery of new insecticides. Indeed the current cost of developing a new insecticide now averages $250 million per active ingredient<sup>1</sup>. 

 The BeeSafe toolkit has been used by Bayer \(since 2016\) to screen potential new insecticides; lead compounds that are metabolised by P450 enzymes are prioritised for development. The purified bee enzymes and associated model fluorescent substrates are being used by Bayer in *in vitro* high\-throughput simple inhibitor assays to assess the metabolic liability of novel compounds. The transgenic fly lines are a useful complement to these assays and are being used to examine the ability of bee P450s to tolerate lead compounds *in vivo*. In contrast to assays on bees, tests using Drosophila are simple, inexpensive \(costing <$0.5K per compound versus $30K per compound for *O. bicornis* **\[5.1\]**\) and rapid \(Drosophila has a two week life cycle, compared to 1 year for *O. bicornis*\) **\[3.4\]**. Ralf Nauen \(chief scientist at Bayer AG\) noted that the new tools developed in the Bee Toxicogenomics project ‘ *are now a vital part of Bayer’s development pipeline, providing a filtering tool to screen new lead insecticides at an early stage, and are allowing us to more rapidly identify and develop new bee\-safe compounds*’ **\[5.2\]**. To allow these tools to be used more widely the transgenic Drosophila lines have been deposited with an open repository \(Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center\) **\[5.3, 3.4\]** to make the panel available to other companies. These tools and the underpinning knowledge were also advertised to scientists in other companies by holding a workshop in 2017 entitled ‘Protecting Bee Pollinators with Comparative Toxicology and Functional Genomics’ attended by representatives from the majority of the five companies that dominate global pesticide sales **\[5.1\]**. Following this Syngenta, one of the ‘big five’ agrochemical companies, have also been supplied with the Drosophila BeeSafe Toolkit and are planning to use this as an integral component of their pesticide research and development pipeline, testifying that this work has ‘ *fundamentally advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that determine the sensitivity of bee pollinators to insecticides*’ **\[5.1\]**. 

 **Predicting and avoiding harmful pesticide\-pesticide interactions** 

 Previous research has shown that when certain pesticides are used in combination, they can be much more harmful to bees than when used individually. Our research has been used to predict and avoid these negative pesticide\-pesticide interactions. For example, azole fungicides can profoundly alter the sensitivity of honey bees to insecticides, including those that are normally considered safe to bees<sup>2</sup>. Our research demonstrated that these azoles inhibit significantly the specific P450 enzymes that confer tolerance to certain insecticides, and thus provided a mechanistic understanding of why these compounds enhance the toxicity of insecticides to bees. Following this discovery, the BeeSafe toolkit has been used by Bayer to test the effects of non\-insecticidal products used in crop protection \(including fungicides\) on bee P450 enzymes, in order to identify which products may be combined safely and which combinations should be avoided **\[5.2, 5.4\]**. This information has underpinned guidelines for growers and agronomists on safe use and has been used to support the registration of specific pesticide combinations that are safe \(see below\). 

 **Supporting insecticide registration** 

 The registration of insecticides is costly and time consuming, currently taking an average of 10 years before a product can reach market. The tools developed in our research have been used to facilitate and accelerate the registration of insecticides by providing evidence of their safety to bees. 

 In order to minimize the risk of negative environmental impacts of a new insecticide, any new product must pass a stringent registration process that includes assessing the product’s safety to bee pollinators. Bayer went through this registration process in 2017/2018 with a product that combined an azole fungicide \(prothioconazole\) with the bee\-safe neonicotinoid thiacloprid for application in oilseed rape crops. However, regulatory bodies in Germany initially rejected the submission due to concerns over possible effects of the azole fungicide sensitising bee pollinators to the insecticide component of the combination. By using the BeeSafe toolkit Bayer were able to demonstrate that, unlike other azole fungicides, prothioconazole does not inhibit the P450 enzymes that are key determinants of sensitivity to thiacloprid in bees. On receipt of this information the regulatory body accepted the registration dossier and allowed the product to come to market for use in Germany for the production of oilseed rape **\[5.2\]**. 

 In summary the knowledge generated by the UoE has had a significant impact on both insecticide production and on safeguarding bee health. It has facilitating the development and registration of bee\-safe crop protection products and predicting negative pesticide\-pesticide interactions. An article from The Scientist **\[5.5\]** quoting Professor May Berenbaum, editor\-in\-chief of the  [Proceedings of the National Academy of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_United_States_of_America) and National Medal of Science laureate, highlighted the following: *‘They’ve provided an incredibly useful service in illuminating how honey bees process toxins.’* Given bees’ routine exposures to pesticides as they forage for food and pollinate crops, *‘it’s incredibly important to know this.’*

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Kariya’s sociological research has had an impact in three distinct ways, which have collectively shifted the Japanese discourse surrounding education policy, in particular in terms of how Japan positions itself on the global university stage. These are: 1\) changes to policy and political debate; 2\) shifting the understanding of policies amongst leaders within the higher education sector; 3\) raising awareness of the issues affecting education policy amongst media consumers and improving journalistic reporting on the issues. All of these contributions centre on research that advocates the importance of evidence\-based policy\-making in education. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Kariya’s research provides alternative views on Japanese education policies. As a sociologist of education, he has covered the full breadth of the educational system in Japan. In recent years, his research has focused on how Japanese higher education institutions view internationalization measures differently to other HEIs in the developed world.  More specifically, he has critically assessed efforts by the Japanese government to globalise their educational institutions along Western lines. This analysis asserts that policymakers misunderstand key elements that are necessary to achieve their aims. This body of work uses sociological methods to explore tensions between state and \(broadly defined\) education policy, and emphasises the importance of evidence\-based policy\-making \( **R1**\). 

 Since 2008, Kariya has conducted discourse analysis of policy documents concerning the globalisation of university education in Japan. In particular, he has focused on the Japanese government’s ‘super\-global university’ scheme: a government\-funded initiative designed to raise the ranking positions of Japanese universities in global league tables by improving their ‘international outlook’ scores. In addition to examining policy documents, Kariya has analysed the grant proposal documents of universities that have applied for this super\-global university scheme. Finally, to contextualise why raising the global ranking positions of Japanese universities was so central to the ‘super\-global university’ policy, this research also delved into the history of successful internationalisation of universities in the UK and examined what impact the global league tables of universities created in the UK \(e.g., THE\) have had on Japanese policy makers. **\(R2, R3\)** 

 Kariya argues that analysing policies from an historical and comparative perspective is essential in understanding how to integrate Japanese university education effectively in a global context. Earlier policies had seen Japanese universities rapidly localise western knowledge into vernacular languages, which reduced the need to use English as a medium of instruction. This created a trade\-off between encouraging the use of Japanese language in teaching \(which enables more people to attend universities without strong western language skills\) and reducing strong oral communication skills in western languages. The resultant weakness of English language skills in Japanese universities has had an adverse effect on their ‘international outlook’ ranking criteria. Without this historical understanding, Kariya argues, Japanese universities will fail in setting realistic and feasible goals. \( **R2, R3, R4**\) 

 One example of the difficulties faced by universities is evident in Japanese government policy towards the employment of ‘foreign/foreign\-related faculty staff’. Kariya reveals that an insufficient supply of government funding to Japanese HEIs has made universities disinclined to hire foreign staff on tenure\-track appointments. Kariya finds that this policy has *increased* the proportion of native Japanese faculty members that are appointed: those who stayed abroad from one to three years on sabbatical leave, without obtaining overseas higher degrees, were included in the reporting, making up on average 40% of the ‘foreign/ foreign\-related staff’ across the universities taking part in this ‘super\-global’ scheme. This research demonstrates empirically that as with earlier initiatives, policy\-sceptical universities have found ways to meet the super\-global targets without increasing their financial risk. \( **R2, R5\)** 

 Kariya’s research reveals that Japanese policymakers have insufficient understanding of the reasons for the success of developed countries such as the USA, UK, and other English\-speaking countries in producing a global brand in higher education. **R2** and **R3** demonstrate that government policies have failed to fill the gap between over\-ambitious and idealistic goals and have not provided sufficient resources to meet them. It also uncovers an implicit ideology of economic nationalism behind the policies, which aims to recover the Japanese economy from long\-lasting economic stagnation by reforming university education with Western\-influenced policies that are inappropriate for Japanese conditions. 

 The analysis of Japanese education policy from an evidence\-based perspective was also evident in research published during the Covid pandemic. In 2020, the spread of Covid\-19 in Japan led policymakers to consider delaying the start of the school year from April to September. Policy\-makers argued that this would bring the Japanese school year into line with Western countries. Along with other sociologists in Japan, Kariya objectively measured the possible side effects caused by this policy change. Based on concrete evidence calculated from publicly available statistics in 47 Japanese prefectures, the research \( **R6**\) predicted the possibility of huge shortages of schoolteachers and day care services.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Shaping Japanese higher education policy** 

  

 Kariya’s research featured in discussions that took place on 14 November 2018 in the Central Council of Education of MEXT, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. This Council is the main policy\-making committee for education policy in Japan. Discussing how Japan should create its own model of higher education, one Council member stated that according to Prof. Kariya of Oxford University, the relative strengths of Japanese university education should be more critically pursued rather than just being based on models outside of Japan: 

 ‘Mr. Kariya in Oxford also said… Japan can, in a sense, be a model for most countries outside Europe, and in that sense, the United States and Europe can have a special perspective. …internationalization only at such a level as English publications, impact factor, etc. is not  harmful, but that is not the only problem I thought.’ \( **S1**\) \(translated from Japanese, citing ideas from **R2**\) 

 The citation by name of an academic, especially one based overseas, is highly unusual in Japanese policymaking circles. 

 The impact of Kariya’s research on the thinking of ministers in MEXT is also acknowledged by the former vice minister of MEXT \(Vice\-Minister from 2013\-2015\). He reflected that: 

 ‘\[Kariya’s\] work, supported by robust empirical evidence, had some impact on our policy when the MEXT’s Central Council summarised a policy report titled “Grand Design for Higher Education in 2040” \(2019\) in acknowledging the importance of pursuing our own model rather than by simply adopting western models. Specifically, his empirical research impacted on our discussions about how to reconstruct overall HEIs curricula and reorganise students learning activities’ \( **S2,** translated\). 

 **Shifting understanding in the higher education sector on globalisation issues** 

 Kariya’s research has played a significant role in how leaders in the higher education sector are approaching issues of globalization. On 27 August 2018, he was invited by the President of Tsudajuku University to deliver a keynote speech at a symposium convened by the Association of Private Universities of Japan. This is one of the largest associations of Japanese private universities with 125 members consisting of high\-ranking administrators \(predominantly presidents or vice\-presidents\).  Kariya’s speech focusing on the globalization issues at the heart of his research, enlightened discussions about the possibility of more feasible university reforms. The President of Tsudajuku University stated in the post\-conference publication that Kariya’s research \(in particular **R2**\) had changed thinking within the Association and across the sector, as she confirms in her e\-mail from September 2019: 

 ‘Top executives in private universities referred to his works on globalisation policies to understand the meaning of the \[government’s\] policies. His research, based on cogent evidence in comparisons with UK HEIS, impacted on our report on ‘How private universities can show their presence globally?’ His delivered speech made us realise defects in government higher education policies, which are made with very limited evidence for policy making.’ \( **S3**, translated\) 

 In the same email, she testifies to how the ideas set out in his book, *The warning bells from Oxford* \[ **R2**\], have been disseminated within the community of university leaders: 

 ‘Kariya provided an insightful perspective that relativizes the perception of educational power inherent in the problems of accreditation and internal quality assurance that are being promoted in Japanese universities under the guise of ‘reform’. The conference was attended by members of the above\-mentioned projects, as well as a number of senior university administrators, including presidents and vice\-chancellors, who had read the book \[ **R2**\]. The influence of the book was clearly evident here as well’ \( **S3**, translated\). 

 Universities are now taking steps to put these recommendations into practice. For example, Kariya was invited to give a keynote speech at a symposium convened by the Kyoto University Research Administrations Office, where the \(then\) President of the University attended. The symposium held on 16 March 2018 was entitled the ‘Future of Humanities and Social Sciences: How research assessment schemes can contribute to further development of research’. A total of 141 researchers and staff from inside and outside the university, as well as members of the media participated. Of these attendees, 55 were from beyond Kyoto, including from Hokkaido and Okinawa \( **S4**\) provinces. The keynote speech was based on Kariya’s research \[ **R2, R3**\], and in a discussion session after the presentation, participants, including the President, discussed the points made in the lecture. Testimony provided by the President indicates a number of subsequent reforms in his university that were influenced by Kariya’s work, especially acknowledging the importance of using academic works in Japanese for globalising their teaching: 

 ‘Inspired by Prof Kariya’s work, we designed our plan to establish ‘Kyoto International Undergraduate Program \(Kyoto IUP\)’ where we invite high school students from ASEAN \[Association of Southeast Asian Nations\] countries. In that newly established programme, launched two years ago, according to Prof. Kariya’s suggestion, we teach them Japanese language for the first half year, followed by classes taught in Japanese with Japanese students.  His ideas also inspired us to build research collaborations with Japanese companies to create innovations by taking advantage of as well as making full use of the strengths of our Japanese language and culture’. \( **S5**, translated\) 

 **Changing national reporting of education and globalization issues in the media** 

 The monograph *The warning bells from Oxford* **\[R2\]** has sold c.23,500 copies nationally in Japan, and book reviews have been published not only in academic journals but also in major newspapers and popular magazines with a significant national circulation. These publications include the Asahi Shinbun Newspaper, the second largest newspaper company in Japan with approximately 5,600,000 daily readers. Asahi Shinbun have a monthly review section of the most influential articles and books, and they refer to Kariya’s work on university education reforms on two occasions: once on 31 August 2017 and once on 15 December 2015 \( **S6a** and **S6b\).** In an e\-mail statement, an Asahi editor confirms how Kariya’s research has influenced their content production: ‘Prof Kariya’s work has provided influential views on higher education policies in Japan by relativizing our interpretations of the policies and has clarified the importance of discovering the strengths of Japanese universities in the global context’ \( **S7**, translated\).  Kariya also contributes a regular column for *Tokyo Keizai*, an equivalent of *The* *Economist* in the UK, where he often presents his research concerning issues of Japanese higher education. This popular weekly journal attracts approximately 90,000 subscribers from business, including executives in major Japanese companies. 

 The prominence of Kariya’s research in the media has directly led to changes in how the Japanese government have designed their evidence base in support of education policies. In late April 2020, the Japanese government suddenly proposed to shift the academic year to start in September \(rather than the traditional April start\) in an attempt to mitigate the impact of Covid\-19 on schoolchildren’s learning, due to the nationwide school closures in the spring of 2020. One of the cited advantages of this move was that it would bring Japan into line with Western nations’ schooling timetables. This announcement led to Kariya organising a team to explore the possible consequences of this policy \[ **R6\]**. The government had not publicly outlined any potentially adverse effects of this change, so as a counterpoint, Kariya’s research was widely reported in major national newspapers. One article in Asahi reported on its front page: ‘If Japan shifted to an academic year starting in September next year, it would face a shortage of 28,000 elementary school teachers and cost local governments close to an additional JPY300,000,000,000 \(USD2,800,000,000\) in the first year, according to a study conducted by a group of seven experts led by Takehiko Kariya, professor in the Sociology of Japanese Society at Oxford University’ \( **S8**, translated\). These newspaper articles became a ‘ *game\-changer*’ in the policy debates \(according to an Asahi article from 4 June 2020\) by providing cogent empirical results to predict the side effects that this hasty policy change might cause \( **S9,** translated\). 

 In early June 2020, the government decided to postpone the policy without clarifying when this would be readdressed, suggesting, in the Japanese political context, that they are no longer planning to implement the proposed policy in the near future. Having seen some of his earlier media work in *Tokyo Keizai*, the Japanese Cabinet Office \(and the Minister responsible for the Covid\-19 response\) invited Kariya to present his research. Presenting his analysis of a Cabinet Office survey undertaken in June 2020, Kariya argued that in order to have a full picture of the potential effect of a September start date on schools, different layers of data \(from individual schools and municipality levels\) needed to be collected in order to create a panel data set. In response, the Cabinet Office ordered a second survey, which was conducted and published in December 2020. Kariya’s influence on the government’s decision was confirmed by a Cabinet Office official whilst the survey was being prepared for publication: 

 ‘According to \[Kariya’s\] suggestion, the Cabinet office has recently conducted the second Survey on the same issue in December 2020, in which the second survey data will be connected to the previous one as much as possible to achieve a panel data design’ \( **S10**, translated\). 

 Kariya’s media work has therefore directly led to an improvement in the government’s ability to make future policy decisions based on the strongest possible evidence base.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Heuser and Meyrick facilitate an appreciation for, and understanding of, once prominent but now side\-lined creative practices and the changing values they reflect. Retrieving, documenting and re\-presenting a wide range of early to mid\-20th\-century cultural products, they generate public interest and engagement, demonstrably impacting on creativity, culture and society. While their catalogues raisonné serve as standard reference texts for collectors, dealers, auctioneers and museum curators worldwide, their exhibitions enable key cultural institutions such as the Royal Academy of Arts, as well as regional venues, to extend their reach for the benefit of a broader, more inclusive audience. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Discrete yet interrelated and largely interdisciplinary, Heuser and Meyrick’s investigative research challenges the ways in which cultural products are classified and historical relevance is determined. Through original archival research, analysis and contextual interpretation, they offer insights into early methods employed in the attribution of Old Master paintings \[3.1, 3.2\], as well as neglected media and revived practices such as 1930s tempera paintings made with recipes dating from the Renaissance, and line engraving methods modelled on Quattrocento techniques \[3.3, 3.4\]. Underlying these diverse projects is the central question why some works, especially products existing as multiples or disseminated via mass media, are canonised while others fall into oblivion or face critical neglect. 

 Examining the historic circumstances and institutional forces that shape the production and reception of works of art and audio\-visual culture, Heuser and Meyrick assess largely untapped primary sources and archival materials to demonstrate how legacies are constructed, practices abandoned and traditions rejected, how spheres of influence widen and reputations fade. 

 Heuser and Meyrick’s ongoing research for catalogues raisonné on British printmakers, which since 2012 have been undertaken in partnership with the Royal Academy of Arts, London, entails tracking down and closely examining thousands of works in public collections, private archives and commercial galleries \[3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]. When no extant prints can be traced but plates and blocks can be located, they draw on their practical knowledge to take impressions for reproduction in their publications. To document states and proofs and establish chronologies, they consult auction records, dealer catalogues and museum databases along with published writings and personal diaries, sales ledgers and correspondences. 

 Responding to the absence of reliable data and consistent information, Heuser and Meyrick extract detail from, and corroborate evidence with, the records of museums and exhibiting societies. Other sources include the archives of print publishers, artists’ wills and valuations for probate, as well as photographs and personal effects, to identify subjects and uncover their cultural and autobiographical references. 

 Heuser and Meyrick have used comparable methodologies in piecing together the biographies of collectors such as queer Welsh dilettante George Powell \(1842–1882\) and artist\-dealer Hugh Blaker \(1873–1934\) \[3.1, 3.2\] through their dispersed collections, in order to uncover the rationales and passions that underlie collecting practices. Open to the multiple and complex narratives this yields, their research has led to unexpected and wide\-ranging discoveries, outputs and impacts. 

 In their re\-presentations of the unseen and unheard, Heuser and Meyrick jointly and individually apply their historic knowledge, curatorial experience, and interdisciplinary methodologies.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Heuser and Meyrick’s projects for the Royal Academy of Arts \(RA\) have assisted a major institution in fulfilling its mission to *‘introduce new audiences to \[its\] art and artists’*. In turn, the RA and regional tour venues have invested significant resources to stage Heuser and Meyrick’s outputs. Their RA exhibitions have attracted nearly GBP100,000 corporate sponsorship. 

 ‘Through a combination of meticulous original research and imaginative public outreach they succeeded once again in stimulating new interest in the life and work of two lesser\-known members of the Royal Academy … publishing the first definitive catalogues of Anderson and Tunnicliffe’s complete output as printmakers alongside detailed accounts of their professional lives’ \[5.1\]. 

 Attendance figures for the exhibitions rank among the highest recorded for the RA’s Tennant Room displays \[5.2\]. Visitor books attest to their appeal and resonance \[5.3\]. Anderson was considered ‘frighteningly topical’, an ‘excellent exposé’ of an ‘unknown’ printmaker and a ‘marvellous discovery’ of an artist whose ‘world view is still pertinent’. Audiences appreciated the ‘great insight to a vanished London’ and ‘tremendously engaging’ narrative. The Tunnicliffe show was welcomed as ‘an eye opener’ that offered ‘much to learn as well as view’. Heuser and Meyrick were praised for ‘bringing Tunnicliffe’s work to the RA’ by viewers wanting ‘more exhibitions like this’. The effective use of the *Smartify* app and the integration of a family\-orientated activity area in the gallery was commended for ‘keeping \[Tunnicliffe’s\] name alive for younger generations’. 

 Heuser and Meyrick’s accompanying curator talks and lunchtime lectures proved increasingly popular: Anderson \(104 tickets\) and Tunnicliffe \(154 tickets, fully booked\) \[5.4\]. Their video introductions on the RA’s website and Vimeo as well as Twitter broadened public reach and increased engagement. 

 The exhibitions were recommended as among the top three ‘must see’ shows in the UK \( *The Telegraph*\), ‘the best things to see, do and book this weekend’ \( *Country Life*\), and ‘Art Picks of the Week’ \( *London Evening Standard*\). They attracted audiences interested in British wildlife \(Tunnicliffe\), architectural history and social history \(Anderson\) as well as farming methods and traditional crafts, with reviews appearing in diverse periodicals such as *The* *Mayfair Times* and the *Regional Furniture Society* \[5.5\]. Heuser re\-curated the RA exhibitions to tour regional venues, further extending their reach. Accessible narratives led to invitations to deliver talks to numerous local art groups and national arts societies. 

 Heuser and Meyrick’s catalogues raisonné are now a principal source of reference for curators and private collectors, dealers and auctioneers, educators, and the general public. They are held by the British Museum, Christchurch Art Gallery, New York Public Library, Chicago Public Library, Princeton, Rijksmuseum, Smithsonian and the Yale Centre for British Art. Curators, salesrooms and dealers now routinely reference ‘Heuser\-Meyrick’ catalogue numbers \[5.6\]. Reviews of Heuser and Meyrick’s books have appeared in *The Burlington Magazine* and *County Life* \[5.7\]. The Tunnicliffe volume was chosen for *Apollo*’s September Book Competition prize, was Hatchard’s July *Book of the Month* and featured in their 2017 *Christmas Catalogue*. Heuser and Meyrick were also among Hatchard’s 2017 *Authors of the Year* \[5.8\]. 

 Evidence suggests that Heuser and Meyrick’s outputs have influenced the art market. Beetles Gallery priced Anderson engravings such as *Beer and Skittles* at £1,450, typically £550–750 a few years previously, citing Heuser\-Meyrick numbers. In June 2019, Abbott and Holder listed Tunnicliffe’s *Goshawk* at £2,250, a 300% price increase compared to previous years \[5.9\]. 

 For dealer John Robertson, the Anderson catalogue became a ‘constant companion for weeks’. Consulting Actuary Stuart Southall acknowledges that one reason he become a collector was ‘having the good fortune to meet’ Meyrick whose ‘encyclopaedic knowledge’ has ‘helped shape \[his\] collection’, which now exceeds 4,000 prints \[5.10\]. 

 Enquiries from collectors, national and international dealers, auctioneers, the media and the public demonstrate trust in Heuser and Meyrick’s connoisseurship. Heuser’s research on Powell led to regional participation in ArtUK’s *Sculpture Near You* project \(2019–2020\), talks to community groups, and an invited LGBTQ\+ performance. Meyrick’s research on Blaker: 

-  furnished Louvre curators with provenance documentation for a canvas now identified as by Georges de la Tour \(2014\); 

-  resulted in video interviews with Meyrick for the *Earlier Mona Lisa* exhibition in Singapore \(2014–15\), Shanghai \(2016\) and Florence \(2019\); 

-  informed TernTV on a Botticelli painting featured in BBC4’s *Britain’s Lost Masterpieces* \(2019\) \[5.11\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Keele University research on the discovery of transiting exoplanets has been developed into a successful and sustained programme of outreach for schools delivered through the “Stardome” – a mobile “exoplanetarium” that takes Keele’s research directly into schools and colleges. This innovative science\-communication programme has engaged more than 30,000 learners in the current REF period, many from disadvantaged communities. By raising awareness of exoplanetary science, it has enhanced science engagement and Science Capital, enthused children and teachers and has underpinned the teaching of Key Stage topics in the school curriculum relating to the Solar System. The impact of the Stardome has been recognised through the award of the 2015 Times Higher Education Award for the “Widening Participation or Outreach Initiative of the Year”, while it now plays an important role in the externally funded, regional Higher Horizons\+ widening\-participation initiative.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Following the discovery of the first known transiting exoplanet \(Charbonneau et al. 2000\), Keele University was one of the first UK groups to develop wide\-area searches for transiting exoplanets.  The WASP consortium \(Wide\-Area Search for Planets\) got the Northern facility “SuperWASP” on\-sky from 2004, followed by its Southern counterpart, the Keele\-led WASP\-South, from 2006. With the publication of the first Keele\-led exoplanet discoveries \(WASP\-4b, Wilson et al. 2008; WASP\-5b, Anderson et al. 2008; WASP\-7b, Hellier et al. 2009\) we quickly realised that here was science that appealed directly and readily to the interests of schoolchildren. Not only do they have an immediate fascination with space and planets \(since, after all, they live on one\), and are naturally curious about big questions such as life elsewhere in the galaxy, but basic questions such as “How big is it?”, “What is the orbital period?”, “How hot is it?”, “Does it have an atmosphere?”, “Could life exist there?”, are questions that children can readily relate to.  Thus, the WASP exoplanet discoveries provide a rare example of a topic that is both cutting\-edge science but can also be assimilated by school children. For example, when WASP\-18b was discovered, as the first\-known planet with an orbital period of less than one day, and so producing the strongest star/planet tidal interaction of any known system, this was both of sufficient scientific interest to make the front cover of Nature \(Hellier et al. 2009; \[ **3.1**\]\) but could also be described to schoolchildren as a planet so close to its star that its orbital period, its “year”, is less than the time it takes Earth to spin once. Such exoplanet discoveries could then be tied readily to Key Stage topics in the school curriculum about how our Solar System works \(e.g., KS2 – year 5: Earth and Space\), including the motions of the Moon and planets.  Hence the Keele astrophysics group started its “Stardome” – a mobile planetarium that could take Keele’s exoplanet science, *directly into* local schools and colleges.  Activities related to Keele’s exoplanet discoveries, and planet formation, could then be combined with a wider understanding of stars and their life cycles, tying in to Keele’s research on star formation \(e.g., Jeffries et al. 2001; \[ **3.5**\]\), and on the origin of the chemical elements and the death of massive stars \(e.g., Pignatari et al. 2011; \[ **3.6**\]\). 

 The Keele\-led WASP\-South has gone on to be the most successful of the ground\-based transit surveys. Together with our collaborators and our Northern\-counterpart survey \(principally, the Universities of St. Andrews, Warwick, Leicester and Queen’s University Belfast; with follow\-up collaborations with the Geneva Observatory, Observatory de Haute Provence, and the University of Liege group who operate the TRAPPIST photometer\), we have now discovered nearly 200 gas\-giant exoplanets \(with the announcement of WASP\-192b in 2020\). Since 2000 there have been over 100 Keele\-led, refereed\-journal papers about exoplanets, principally announcements of the WASP exoplanet discoveries, and another 100 Keele\-led, refereed papers about the formation and life cycles of stars. Notable exoplanet discoveries from the Keele\-led WASP\-South survey, that can translate directly into Stardome presentations, include: WASP\-8b \(Queloz et al. 2010; \[ **3.2**\]\), the first hot\-Jupiter found in a highly eccentric orbit; WASP\-17b \(Anderson et al. 2010; \[ **3.3**\]\), the first hot\-Jupiter found in a retrograde orbit; WASP\-18b \(Hellier et al. 2009; \[ **3.1**\]\), with the strongest star\-planet tidal interaction; WASP\-19b \(Hebb et al. 2010\), the hot\-Jupiter with the shortest\-known orbital period; WASP\-30b \(Anderson et al. 2010\), the first known transiting brown dwarf; WASP\-43b \(Hellier et al. 2011; \[ **3.4**\]\), the closest\-orbiting hot\-Jupiter; WASP\-47b \(Hellier et al. 2012\), the first hot Jupiter found with small, rocky companion planets; WASP\-76b \(West et al. 2013\), a planet that has rain of droplets of iron; WASP\-80b \(Triaud et al. 2013\), the first hot\-Jupiter found transiting a red\-dwarf star; WASP\-96b \(Hellier et al. 2013\), the first planet shown to have clear skies; WASP\-121b \(Delrez et al. 2015\), distorted by its star’s gravity into an egg shape; WASP\-166b \(Hellier et al. 2018\), the lowest\-mass of the WASP planets, and WASP\-189 \(Anderson et al. 2018\), the brightest star known to be transited by a hot\-Jupiter planet.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Keele’s “Stardome” is a mobile planetarium specifically designed to take cutting\-edge research directly into local schools and colleges \( **5.8**\). Presentations pitched at school children are custom created by Keele academics. The presentations tie Keele’s exoplanet discoveries to Key Stage topics in the school curriculum about how our Solar System works, including discussion of the motions of the Moon and planets, and ideas about heat, light, and atmospheres, and also aspects of life sciences and evolutionary biology. The Stardome is a 360\-degree fully immersive, multi\-sensory, inflatable planetarium that can be taken into schools and other venues, and which seats a class of children in one go. A typical 45\-minute Stardome session \(of which there are usually 5\-8 in a school day\) begins with blasting off into space, followed by a tour of the objects within the Solar System, before exploring a selection of WASP extra\-solar planets \(examples listed in Sections 2 and 3 above\), discussing how they were discovered, their orbits, size, masses and compositions, and their potential to support life. 

 Stardome visits are focused on areas of high socio\-economic deprivation, with academic staff, assisted by Keele undergraduate students, delivering a multimedia experience to inspire and enthuse children, teachers and future outreach practitioners alike.  During the REF period \(August 2013 to December 2020\) more than 30,000 school children and 500 teachers from over 140 schools have benefited from sessions in the Stardome \( **5.1**\). 

 The Stardome originated from a 2011 “Science in Society” grant from the STFC \(“An Exoplanetarium for Schools"", PI Prof Rob Jeffries, £6850\), combined with funding from the Keele alumni fund. From there the programme expanded to involve the National Network for Collaborative Outreach \(NNCO\), Harper Adams University, the University of Wolverhampton and Staffordshire University. In 2016, the Ogden Trust funded an Outreach Officer, Scott Walker, who expanded the delivery of Stardome sessions, while the  [Higher Horizons\+](https://higherhorizons.co.uk/) collaboration \(part of the government\-funded  [Uni Connect Programme](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/promoting-equal-opportunities/uni-connect/)\), further invested in and extended the Stardome’s outreach activities from 2017. In recent years the reach of the Stardome has expanded to areas including Lancashire, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. The development and delivery of Stardome sessions has benefited from the continued close involvement of astrophysics academic staff and PhD students \(e.g., Prof Jeffries has delivered more than 50 Stardome days in schools during this REF period\). More than 30 Keele students, including those from other disciplines, have been trained in Stardome delivery and as student ambassadors, with a number of them deciding to embark on a career in teaching as a result. 

 **Reaching New Audiences** 

 From the outset, a key aim of the Stardome programme was to address the limited engagement of local young people with STEM subjects and Higher Education \(HE\). The Stardome, as part of Higher Horizons\+ Uni Connect programme, focuses upon areas with an unexplained gap in Higher Education participation. This supports the people component of the Industrial Strategy white paper \(p. 97,  [Industrial Strategy: Building a Britain fit for the future](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664563/industrial-strategy-white-paper-web-ready-version.pdf), BEIS, 2017\). Communities in Keele’s local environment of Stoke\-on\-Trent are under\-represented within higher education, with only 15.5% of Stoke’s population having a HE qualification compared to the national average of 27.4% \( [UK census, 2011](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census)\), while 60% of adults have a reading age of  under 11 \( [Stoke.gov, 2016](http://webapps.stoke.gov.uk/uploadedfiles/Health-literacy-event-June-2016-reduced-file.pdf)\).  Across Stoke\-on\-Trent and the North West of England, 43 schools in the most socio\-economically disadvantaged areas, according to  [Indices of Deprivation](http://dclgapps.communities.gov.uk/imd/iod_index.html) data, have engaged with the Stardome \( **5.1**\). In total, over the REF period, the Stardome programme has interacted with 144 schools, over 500 teachers, over 30,000 children, and numerous other community groups and events.  Dozens of schools have arranged repeat visits, for example Burnwood Community Primary School \(Stoke\-on\-Trent, 59.6% free school meals\) and Grace Academy Darlaston \(Walsall, 58.0% free school meals\) \( **5.1**\). 

 Importantly, the Stardome also reaches audiences with learning difficulties who would often struggle to access space and exoplanet research. Sessions were delivered at all the local SEN \(special education needs\) schools. A manager at Caudwell Children relayed the following comment from a parent of a child attending a Stardome session “We had a fabulous time thank you so much. \[….\] has come home super inspired. He loved the whole experience, I think because it was so immersive in the dome and to have the guided talk from someone who had so much knowledge and enthusiasm really added to it.” \( **5.2**\) It is also clear that the fully immersive environment plays a key role in supporting the young people’s engagement with the material “My class were so engaged and inspired by this session \[…..\] It has genuinely improved their engagement” \( **5.3**\). 

  

 The impact of the Stardome has been acknowledged at a national level through it being awarded the 2015 Times Higher Education Award for 'Widening Participation or Outreach Initiative of the Year' \( **5.4**\). The judges reported the project made excellent use of “astronomy as a gateway into physics” and show\-cased “the work of a university to a wider group of people” \( **5.4**\). 

 **Widening access to Higher Education** 

 The Stardome has made an important contribution in increasing the most socio\-economically disadvantaged learners enrolling at Keele with the university performing 7.2% above its benchmark in 2018/19 \( **5.6**\). Evaluations, completed by 4316 children immediately after participating in a Stardome session, show that 70% had learned what an exoplanet is, 79% were, as a result, more interested in science. The evaluation also found that 50% of young people aged 14 and over were then considering studying a science subject at University \( **5.7**\). Higher Horizons\+ believe that the Stardome programme, particularly with its extension in Birmingham, has widened participation not just at Keele University, but across the Higher Education \(HE\) sector \( **5.5**\). 

 **Enhancing Science Capital** 

 The science capital teaching approach \[see Godec, S, King, H, Archer, L, \(2017\)  [The Science Capital Teaching Approach: engaging students with science, promoting social justice](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10080166/). London: University College London\] has been adopted by the Stardome programme and is designed to enable audiences to find more meaning and relevance in science and, as a result, engage more with the subject. As described by a teacher, the Stardome brings “the stars into the classroom ... \[and\] is what really fires their imagination and gives them that enthusiasm to go on to become future scientists” \( **5.8**\). 

 The impact on teachers has been confirmed by post\-event surveys carried out in 2016\-2019 \( **5.3**\). Of 81 respondents, 75 said they were “very satisfied” with the Stardome experience. The reactions of teachers included “Absolutely amazing experience for the children and adults. We were blown away”; “The children, and staff, thoroughly enjoyed the space dome and were completely in awe of the whole experience""; “The amount of enthusiasm generated from the Stardome across the school was phenomenal...”; “It was BRILLIANT\! I was in awe and so were the children\! Scott \[former PhD student from the school of Chemical and Physical Sciences and now Ogden Trust Outreach Officer who delivered more than 100 Stardome days\] was so knowledgeable and engaging”, and many more. Success can also be judged by repeat requests for Stardome visits to schools. 79/81 said they would book the Stardome again \( **5.3**\) and many did. A teacher from Blythe Bridge High school commented, “We have used the Stardome for the last 6 years as part of the Year 5 Physics Festival. The knowledge & understanding the students get from this opportunity are first class"". 

 100% of the teachers surveyed said they thought that children had benefited from the Stardome sessions \( **5.3**\) with comments such as “Fantastic resource and children learnt a lot.”. 65% of them identified specific topics that the children learnt something new about. These include exoplanets \(and the search for them\), Goldilocks Zone \(life needing water\), evolution of life, alien life, life forms, stars, planets and their moons. Several teachers said they learnt something new too, which gives them more in\-depth knowledge and confidence about teaching this topic to children. In another post\-event survey asking 24 teachers in 2019\-2020 whether the pupils were more interested in STEM subjects since taking part in the Stardome session, 83% of the teachers answered yes \( **5.9**\). Comments from teachers include: “Greater enthusiasm for science”, “Children including planets names in their work and conversations” and “Children went home to research questions generated from the Stardome.” 

 The Stardome’s long\-term impact upon learning is clear from longitudinal teacher surveys, which are undertaken a minimum of 12 months post event, reporting an enhanced student self\-efficacy, confidence, and willingness to engage in their learning \( **5.5**\). In addition, the  Stardome programme provides the gateway for teachers, particularly those in primary schools who are typically non\-science specialists, to develop a professional physics network. 

 Overall, the Stardome provided the children and staff with a memorable and exciting experience. More importantly, the Stardome successfully consolidated and extended children’s knowledge of space, inspiring them to find out more about the topic and STEM subjects in general.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The global challenge of population ageing combined with increasing urbanisation demands innovative approaches to planning our cities in order to support people across the life\-course. This research has developed community\-engaged programmes across the scales of home, neighbourhood and city. It has established the *age\-friendly neighbourhood approach* to engaged design\-research with older people, improved quality of life for 19,854 older people across six communities in Manchester and shaped relevant policy and practice through KE partnerships with local government, including the Greater Manchester \(GM\) ‘Ageing in Place’ programme \(over 12 districts and 151,000 older residents\). It has also influenced global policy and practitioner discourse on developing age\-friendly cities through our integral contribution to Manchester’s status as the first UK World Health Organisation \(WHO\) Age Friendly City, GM as the first WHO Age\-friendly City\-region in Europe, and recognition of Manchester as a 4\* Pilot site by the European Innovation Partnership for Active and Healthy Ageing. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The Place Health: Architecture Space Environment \(PHASE\) research group, led by Professor Stefan <ins>White</ins> and based at Manchester School of Architecture, argues that the global challenge of urban ageing requires two simultaneous responses: a holistic, multi\-determinate planning approach to well\-being and full, active participation of citizens throughout their life course. The research investigates and acts on these principles through a series of engaged design\-research projects developed in close co\-creative collaboration with older people and public institutions. 

 Through engaged design and research programmes, PHASE has developed the theoretical, practical and methodological conceptualisation of an ‘Age\-Friendly Neighbourhood’ \(AFN\). Through a series of exploratory collaborations with local government, housing providers and international academics, the group developed the pioneering ‘Age\-Friendly Old Moat’ \(AFOM\) project, which is now an internationally recognised best\-practice case study **\[1\]**. It was the first project to demonstrate how the World Health Organisation’s ‘Age\-Friendly Cities’ policy and planning goals could be achieved through highly community\-engaged research in specific neighbourhoods. <ins>White</ins> and <ins>Hammond</ins> defined the key principles of the ‘Age\-Friendly Neighbourhoods’ model in a chapter included in a book edited by the ESRC International Network on Population Ageing and Urbanisation \(INPAU\), of which they were co\-investigators **\[2\]**. Their contribution connects social science techniques to place\-based design\-research and direct community engagement methodologies. 

 ‘Age\-Friendly Old Moat’ continues to have significant influence on policy and practice, notably as the template for the GBP10,200,000 Big Lottery\-funded Ambition for Ageing \(AfA\) programme, which resulted in the development of 24 age\-friendly neighbourhoods across Greater Manchester, led by voluntary sector groups including Age UK. Old Moat is also cited internationally as a best\-practice example of an age\-friendly neighbourhood project, and is the basis of the current Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\) Ageing in Place strategy. PHASE undertook additional design\-research as local delivery leads for the Manchester Age\-Friendly Neighbourhoods \(MAFN\) segment of the AfA programme, including a series of co\-produced local planning and research projects in 5 electoral wards, investigating the potential of engaged research and creative methodologies to address issues of social isolation in excluded communities. <ins>Hammond</ins> is lead author of a chapter documenting this design research, written with <ins>White</ins> and Professor Christopher Phillipson of University of Manchester **\[3\].** In theoretical terms, this work on age\-friendly neighbourhoods has been consolidated by <ins>White</ins> in chapters related to disability scholarship **\[4\]** and touching on the broader ethical and architectural implications of a Deleuzian post\-structuralist framing of difference **\[5\]**. 

 Other components of the research have included: the development of a multi\-award\-winning community technology partnership – PlaceCal – to tackle poor access to local information amongst older people; refinement of our data analysis methodologies through collaborations with Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council and Southway Housing Trust, with both projects exploring how data synthesis can be a conduit for more creative and collaborative design processes; and, in collaboration with the Centre for Ageing Better, the development of place\-based age\-friendly housing strategies across three neighbourhoods in Greater Manchester **\[6\]**. Related design\-research exploring the role of collective housing options for older people continues to support the construction of new models of older people’s co\-housing across multiple sites in south Manchester.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Establishment of the ‘neighbourhood approach’** 

 Using innovative participative design\-research, PHASE has introduced and defined the concept of an ‘Age\-Friendly Neighbourhood’ \(AFN\), which translates the WHO Age\-Friendly City principles into a place\-based, research\-led model for local change. This conceptual definition has been produced through creation of methodologies for, and delivery of, a series of age\-friendly programmes at a neighbourhood level, notably in the Age\-Friendly Old Moat \(AFOM\) and Manchester Age\-Friendly Neighbourhood \(MAFN\) projects. The ‘age\-friendly neighbourhood’ approach has been a key factor in Greater Manchester being awarded Age\-Friendly status in 2017, with ‘age\-friendly neighbourhoods’ a central pillar of their delivery plan **\[A\]**, as further demonstrated through the use of the AFOM pilot as the template for a five\-year GBP10,200,000 programme \(Ambition for Ageing \- AfA\) across 24 neighbourhoods in the city\-region. Manchester School or Architecture led five of these areas directly and provided training on participatory action planning methodologies for the seven other local delivery partners. Over 20,000 older people have contributed to the AfA programme since 2016, which has led to over 1,413 local projects \(total value GBP2,100,000\) being funded **\[B\]**. 

 **Improved quality of life** **for older residents** 

 The AFN projects have demonstrated improvements in older residents’ well\-being and increased levels of social and civic participation. Since completion of the AFOM research, project partner Southway Housing Trust invested GBP730,000 on delivering the age\-friendly action plan co\-created with local residents alongside related responses such as 277 property refurbishments and 54 new build age\-friendly houses. The number of residents who consider their neighbourhood to be age\-friendly has increased from 55% to 80% while the number of older people who report feeling lonely or socially isolated has decreased from 21% to 10% as a result of AFOM **\[C\]**. MAFN expanded the co\-production methodologies pioneered by PHASE across five wards in Manchester. Between 2016\-2019, PHASE led over 200 design\-research activities with 1,200 individuals and over 6,000 instances of resident participation. MAFN supported each neighbourhood to develop a self\-sustaining, independent resident\-led multi\-stakeholder partnership involving community groups, councillors, council, health and social care services, statutory authorities and the voluntary sector **\[C\]**. Each of these co\-produced a local neighbourhood action plan and altogether the neighbourhoods co\-designed over 150 small projects that address social isolation amongst older people, distributing over GBP356,000 of funding to local initiatives led by older residents. 

 **Local, regional and national policy and practice** 

 Age\-Friendly Old Moat is an inspirational case study for the Mayoral Challenge on Age\-Friendly Neighbourhoods, launched in 2019 by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham ‘to identify best practice work on ageing within the city\-region'. The 2017 GMCA report ‘The Future of Ageing in Greater Manchester’ sets out the city\-region’s ambitions for anchoring age\-friendliness as a core principle in the region’s policies, citing the AFOM project as a model that should be replicated. This policy position was subsequently integrated into the Greater Manchester Strategy **\[D\],** adopted by the ten local authorities of Greater Manchester. The policy’s delivery mechanism, the ‘Ageing in Place Programme’, which was launched in 2019, looks to establish age\-friendly neighbourhoods across 12 districts within the city\-region, with a total older population of 151,000 residents. <ins>White</ins> and <ins>Hammond</ins> sit on the academic advisory group for the ‘Ageing in Place Programme’. The collaboration with Age\-Friendly Manchester \(Manchester City Council\) and the GM Ageing Hub \(Greater Manchester Combined Authority\) has significantly shaped strategy, policy and public services within Greater Manchester. This has included two secondments to the GM Ageing Hub at GMCA to develop research\-led policy documents, notably supplementary guidance on ageing as part of the forthcoming GM Spatial Framework, which is the 20\-year development plan for the city region **.** These secondments were enabled by <ins>White</ins> being awarded the Manchester Met ‘Metropolis’ Chancellor’s fellowship. There are 907,000 people aged over 50 in Greater Manchester directly affected by the GM Ageing Hub, regarded by WHO as a best\-practice example for ageing policy and practice. 

 The GM Ageing Hub’s 2018 strategy acknowledges Manchester Met as a key partner, and Paul McGarry, Assistant Director at GMCA, explains how working with PHASE ‘... led us to adopt a focus on creating ‘age\-friendly neighbourhoods’... \[as\] a core feature of the Greater Manchester Ageing Strategy, and has been pivotal in a series of delivery programme such as Ambition for Ageing, the GM Mayoral Challenge on Age\-Friendly Neighbourhoods and the Ageing in Place Programme’. He adds that ‘Working with PHASE has allowed us to rethink our approach to ageing and the built environment, and the role GMCA has in shaping it... showing how local government, commercial and academic collaboration can take a lead in shaping the market around issues of ageing and inclusion.’ **\[E\].**  The Rightsizing and Rightplace projects developed to address specific knowledge gaps related to planning for older people around place as identified by the ageing, housing and research teams at GMCA. Both were funded by The Centre for Ageing Better, which has a memorandum of understanding with GMCA to support policy\-engaged research. In the foreword to the Rightsizing report, GM Mayor Andy Burnham explicitly recognises that the GMCA’s partnership with PHASE ‘has helped position Greater Manchester as world\-leaders when it comes to research on ageing \[urging\] policymakers across the UK to capitalise on this expertise we have available’. Findings of this research have subsequently been integrated into GM Housing Strategy and GM Spatial Framework **\[F\]** and nationally promoted by the Centre for Ageing Better. <ins>Hammond</ins> and <ins>White</ins>’s age\-friendly housing research has been cited by the International Longevity Centre as a key strength of GM’s ageing approach, highlighting the economic opportunities for GM from better responding to the housing needs of older people **\[G\]**. Their age\-friendly neighbourhood projects are also cited in a report from the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology \(POSTNote\) about ‘Creating Age\-Friendly Cities’ **.** The All\-Party Parliamentary Group in Social Inclusion report ‘Healing the Generational Divide’ highlighted the integration of research and teaching within Manchester School of Architecture as best practice for exploring issues of ageing and inclusion. The report recommends: “All schools of architecture and architectural practices throughout the UK should be encouraged and supported to explore how living spaces can be designed to promote intergenerational connection.” **\[H\].** More recently PHASE is working alongside Design Council, Microsoft, Cisco, Pozzoni Architects, Health Innovation Manchester and GMCA to create a commercial age\-friendly design agency, funded by the UKRI Healthy Ageing Trailblazer programme. The aim of this programme is to scale up innovation enabled by PHASE’s age\-friendly research and apply it to a range of live development projects in 2021\-2025. 

 **Global policy and practitioner influence** 

 The strength of Greater Manchester’s academic\-policy integration on ageing, housing and neighbourhoods is internationally recognised. It contributed to Greater Manchester’s age\-friendly programme being awarded the maximum 4\* status from the EU\-led European Innovation Partnership on Active and Health Ageing and was cited as best practice by the Finnish government who recommended adopting the same approach in its national policy **\[I\]**. In their 10\-year review the World Health Organisation notes in relation to Manchester’s ageing programme that ‘through partnerships with a local university older people in Manchester have also played an active role as co\-researchers investigating and improving the “age\- friendliness” of their communities’. The Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development \(OECD\) includes Age Friendly Old Moat as part of an international review of ageing and urbanism **\[J\]**. <ins>W</ins><ins>hite</ins> and <ins>Hammond</ins> have shared their approach with international delegations from USA, Japan, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. <ins>White</ins> provided the keynote address at the launch of Age\-Friendly Gothenburg in 2017. <ins>White</ins> and <ins>Hammond</ins> have joined Foreign Office policy and research delegations to Wuhan, China, and Montpellier, France. PHASE research is included as a case study in the internationally recognised industry\-focused reports series ‘Cities Alive’ by Arup and in various RIBA publications, including ‘The Alternative Age\-Friendly Handbook’, ‘Age\-Friendly Housing: Future design for older people’ and ‘A Home for the Ages’ **\[K\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Older people living with frailty account for around £6 billion of annual NHS expenditure. We led development and national implementation of an electronic frailty index \(eFI\) that uses routine GP data to identify frailty. The national implementation of the eFI led to major NHS policy impact as it enabled a standardised approach to identifying frailty nationally, providing the platform for the 2017/18 NHS England GP contract and inclusion in the 2019 NHS Long Term Plan. Impact on health and care services is supported through inclusion in NICE guidelines and the development of new models of frailty care, cited in national frailty guidelines. Recognition of impact is through selection as an example of world\-class National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) research making a difference to patient care, and the prestigious 2017 Royal College of Physicians’ \(RCP\) Excellence in Patient Care Award. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Frailty is a condition that is common in old age. It develops because as we get older our bodies change, and can lose their inbuilt reserves. These changes mean that older people with frailty can experience sudden dramatic changes in their health when they have an illness. International guidelines recommend frailty should be identified routinely so a more holistic approach to care can be taken, and effective treatments provided. However, the main historical difficulty with identifying frailty routinely is that available clinical tools, such as measuring walking speed or frailty questionnaires, require additional resource, and might be inaccurate. 

 Professor Clegg and Dr Teale led the underpinning research to develop and validate the eFI in a landmark study funded by the NIHR \( **1**\). The study used the cumulative deficit model, which identifies frailty on the basis of a range of variables including symptoms, signs, diseases, disabilities and abnormal laboratory values, collectively referred to as deficits. Primary care electronic health record \(EHR\) systems in the UK use Read Codes to categorise and log multiple patient characteristics including symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, diseases, disabilities and information about social circumstances. Primary care EHR systems therefore provide a potentially simple yet powerful mechanism for identifying cumulative deficits to identify frailty routinely. 

 Between 2014 and 2016, we followed published guidelines to develop, internally validate and externally validate the eFI in a retrospective cohort study using anonymised primary care EHR data in the ResearchOne and The Health Improvement Network \(THIN\) databases. The work was led by Clegg and Teale in a collaboration including researchers from the University of Birmingham and the University of Bradford. Following initial development, we constructed eFI categories \(fit, mild frailty, moderate frailty, severe frailty\). We validated by investigating predictive validity for outcomes of all\-cause mortality, unplanned hospitalisation and nursing home admission, using adjusted hazard ratios \(HR\) at 1, 3 and 5 years, and assessed discrimination and calibration. 

 We used data from a total of 931,541 patients. The eFI incorporates 36 deficits constructed using 2,171 primary care Read Codes. The eFI calculates a frailty score as a simple proportion of the deficits present in an individual divided by the total possible \(e.g. if 9/36 deficits are present, the eFI score = 0.25\). One year adjusted HR for mortality was 1.92 \(95% confidence interval, CI, 1.81\-2.04\) for mild frailty, 3.10 \(95% CI 2.91\-3.31\) for moderate frailty and 4.52 \(95% CI 4.16\-4.91\) for severe frailty. Corresponding estimates for hospitalisation were 1.93 \(95% CI 1.86\-2.01\), 3.04 \(95% CI 2.90\-3.19\) and 4.73 \(95% CI 4.43\-5.06\), and for nursing home admission were 1.89 \(95% CI 1.63\-2.15\), 3.19 \(95% CI 2.73\-3.73\) and 4.76 \(95% CI 2.73\-3.73\), with good to moderate discrimination. 

 These key research insights were globally leading as this work was the first international study to use routinely available, nationally representative data to develop and validate a measure of frailty. Following validation, Professor Clegg and Dr Teale led the national implementation of the eFI into the SystmOne, EMISWeb, Vision and Microtest primary care EHR systems, making it freely available to 100% of general practices in England and 95% of all UK practices. The national implementation work was also globally leading, enabling the UK to become the first country to have a nationally available tool for identifying frailty as part of routine care. 

 This underpinning research work provided the foundation for the impact described in this case study, and has also become a key reference point for future research, including beyond the original institution and research team. This has included internationally\-leading work identifying that: 

-  Home modifications reduce care home admissions for older people with moderate and severe frailty, in collaboration with researchers at the Universities of Swansea and Liverpool \( **2**\). 

-  People with frailty account for an additional £6 billion of NHS expenditure, in collaboration with researchers at the University of York \( **3**\). 

-  Frailty is a key predictor of hospitalisation after a diagnosis of heart failure, in collaboration with researchers at Imperial College London \( **4**\). 

-  Frailty is an indicator of older people nearing end of life, who may be suitable for advance care planning, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Newcastle \( **5**\), and 

-  Hypertension risk is modified in the presence of frailty, indicating need for tailored blood pressure care in frailty, in work led by researchers at King’s College London \( **6**\). 

 The underpinning eFI work has led directly to considerable competitive grant capture, including:

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Our eFI project has had direct impact on national health policy, and provision of evidence\-based health and care services for older people, alongside wider societal and economic impact, through implementation of new models of evidence\-based care to improve outcomes for older people living with frailty. Selection of our eFI project as an example of world class NIHR research making a difference to patient care provides further evidence of impact \( **A**\). 

 **Impact on national health policy** 

 Our eFI national implementation project enabled major impact on NHS policy change by providing the infrastructure for the 2017/18 GP contract, which includes identification and management of people living with moderate and severe frailty as a key requirement for every general practice in England \( **B**\). The 2017/18 GP contract supports population\-level frailty stratification using the eFI \( **C**\). To maximise impact and spread, we worked in partnership with NHS England and NHS RightCare to develop supporting resources necessary for GP contract implementation and subsequent development of the NHS RightCare Frailty Toolkit to help optimise a national frailty system using the eFI \( **D**\). 

 The success of the eFI national implementation and GP contract changes has had further impact on national policy by directly influencing the 2019 NHS Long Term Plan \( **E**\). The Plan specifies supporting people to age well as a key objective, with a greater focus on proactive care based on population health management, including use of the eFI. 

 Following national implementation of the eFI, NHS England data indicate over 2.5 million older people have been assessed for frailty and around 1 million have been identified as living with moderate or severe frailty \( **F**\). 25,570 people with frailty have been identified as at risk of falling and referred to a falls service, with an estimated prevention of around 2,300 future falls, and 210,687 have received a medication review to optimise medications, reduce tablet burden, and reduce potential side\-effects. 

 **Impact on provision of evidence\-based health and care services** 

 Use of the eFI is recommended in the 2016 NICE multimorbidity guideline \( **G**\). Additional examples of work using the eFI have been cited in Royal College of General Practitioners and British Geriatrics Society guidance on integrated care for older people \( **H**\). 

 We established a national Healthy Ageing Collaborative \(HAC\) as part of the Yorkshire & Humber Academic Health Science Network Improvement Academy to maximise impact on provision of evidence\-based frailty services. The HAC has engaged with 75 of the 209 CCGs in England to support the use of the eFI to develop new models of care at a practice and population level. Work has extended into Scotland, where the eFI has been implemented in a new model of care to improve quality of life for older people living with frailty across nine general practices spanning three health and social care partnerships, including 75,311 older people aged <ins>></ins>65 \( **I**\). As part of our national implementation project, the eFI has also been implemented into bespoke national healthcare intelligence systems \(eMBED/Dr Foster; ACG Johns Hopkins; RAIDR\) to enable population modelling and improve commissioning decisions. 

 Examples of the interventions deployed in primary care after identifying people with frailty using the eFI include: 

-  Targeted medication reviews to reduce problematic prescribing \(NHS Vale of York CCG\) 

-  Proactive falls prevention \(NHS Leeds South & East CCG\) 

-  Advance care planning and palliative care \(NHS Airedale, Wharfdale & Craven CCG\) 

-  Comprehensive geriatric assessment as an evidence\-based frailty intervention \(NHS South Devon & Torbay CCG\) 

-  Supported self\-management for people with mild frailty \(NHS Bradford Districts CCG\). 

 In recognition of this major and innovative impact on health and care services, our eFI team were awarded the prestigious 2017 RCP Excellence in Patient Care Award and 2016 E\-Health Insider \(EHI\) Award for Healthcare Innovation Product of the Year. These prestigious awards have generated considerable national and international interest in the eFI, facilitating spread, uptake and impact. 

 **Wider societal and economic impact** 

 The implementation of evidence\-based interventions to improve outcomes using the eFI for proactive case\-finding supports sustainability of health and care systems, including reducing demand for services. The eFI is included in a Health Foundation report as an exemplar of how investing in health and care data analytics can support the allocation of finite resources and delivery of high quality care to maximise system sustainability and economic benefit \( **J**\). Parallel work with NHS England to model health and social care costs associated with frailty, and impact of implementing interventions on projected cost savings, has informed ongoing health policy plans \( **K**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Using techniques from astronomy, we have developed drones with thermal cameras and an automated fire\-detection system to tackle peat\-fires. Working with Indonesian collaborators we have used the system over 2 Indonesian peat\-fire seasons. Fire\-fighters report the system is over 10x quicker finding fires, 50% quicker extinguishing fires and over 10x quicker confirming fires are extinguished. We estimate this has \(i\) saved 78 tons \(156 trans\-Atlantic flights\) of CO<sub>2</sub> from entering the atmosphere per drone system per month; \(ii\) saved firefighters 200 days of hazardous smoke inhalation; \(iii\) reduced the toxic haze faced by the 15 million residents surrounding the fires. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Our research aims to adapt the expertise that astronomers have in building and operating thermal infrared cameras to significantly reduce the extent and duration of peat fires. These fires comprise a significant fraction of annual anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions – a main driver of climate change – and create a toxic haze which, in severe years, seriously affects the health of millions and has caused >100,000 premature deaths in Indonesia alone. Through a series of published research papers, we have demonstrated that techniques astrophysicists use to build, operate, and extract the maximum science from thermal infrared cameras on telescopes, are ideally suited to optimising the data collection and interpreting the data taken with thermal cameras on drones to detect peat fires. The project is effectively doing astrophysics, but rather than pointing into space, we are turning our ""telescopes"" back towards Earth to help tackle climate change. Since 2015 we have been using astrophysics expertise to build drones equipped with commercial off\-the\-shelf \(COTS\) thermal cameras to help ecologists detect animals and humans using on drones. In 2017 we published our first paper demonstrating that astronomical source detection software is well suited to detecting warm objects \(animals and humans in this case\) in thermal drone images \[UR1\]. 

 Building on this success, in 2017 we were awarded £50k from the UK Government’s Science and Technology Facilities Council \(STFC\) \[grant ST/P003273/1\] to hire a postdoc to begin systematically adapting astrophysics techniques to work in real, field\-site conditions. We subsequently published two papers at the start of 2018 describing how to adapt thermal\-infrared technology and astronomical techniques to overcome environmental and atmospheric challenges to capture high precision thermal data for use in ecological studies \[UR2,3\]. 

 Having successfully demonstrated the adaption of astrophysics techniques to work in real field conditions, later in 2018 we were awarded £412k of STFC funding \(grant ST/R002673/1\) to \(i\) begin using our thermal drone system to help conservation agencies around the globe and \(ii\) build a website with integrated machine learning analysis tools that can automatically find objects of interest in conservation images and videos. We have subsequently published multiple papers as a result of this work, demonstrating that thermal imaging from drones offers a major advance for ecological surveys \[e.g. UR4,5\]. 

 When it became clear that the use of the system in the field was having an immediate and very positive impact on ecological surveys \(see our other Impact Case Study\), we began looking for other ways to capitalise on our research. In 2018 we began testing whether the system could be adapted to detect, identify, and help prevent the spread of peat fires, which are a major contributor to climate change. We conducted a very successful proof\-of\-concept experiment flying our system over controlled peat fires in Indonesia. In early 2019 we published a paper summarising the results of this research, showing that thermal drones are a safe and reliable method for detecting subterranean peat fires \[UR6\]. Building on the success of this research, we were subsequently awarded a £422k STFC GCRF grant \(ST/S00288X/1\) to train local stakeholders in the usage and maintenance of the system. This research and grant funding has led to the impact described below.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Climate change presents the single biggest threat to sustainable development across the world<sup>1</sup>. Its widespread, unprecedented impacts – driven by increasing amounts of carbon\-bearing greenhouse gases like CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere – disproportionately burden the poorest and most vulnerable. The high carbon content of peat makes it one of Nature’s most efficient carbon stores. The annually re\-occurring peat forest fires in Indonesia represent a substantial fraction \(up to 15 – 20%\) of the global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions<sup>2</sup>. In severe years they release more CO<sub>2</sub> than the entire global transport sector<sup>3</sup>, thus greatly impacting climate change. The fires have additional devastating consequences. They lead to enormous economic losses<sup>4</sup> for tens of millions of Indonesian people, and the World Bank estimates that tens of millions of people suffer health problems from these annual fires<sup>5</sup>. 

 Efforts are underway to find and contain the fires, but the challenges faced are considerable. For example, to completely extinguish a peat fire with an area of only 1m<sup>2</sup> requires 200 – 400 litres of water\(\!\). Identifying the precise location of fires when they are small and more easily contained and extinguished is therefore vital. However, finding and then fighting fires on peatlands is difficult and dangerous work, owing to limited accessibility, water availability and visibility, particularly in remote and forested areas, plus the fact that peat fires can burn beneath the surface and re\-emerge.

 <sup>4</sup> The World Bank estimates Indonesia lost USD 16.1 billion in 2015 alone \( [http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/643781465442350600/Indonesia\-forest\-fire\-notes.pdf](http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/643781465442350600/Indonesia-forest-fire-notes.pdf)\) 

 <sup>5</sup> For example, Crippa et al. \(2016, Scientific Reports, 37074\) estimate 69 million people were exposed to smoke for 3 months and 100,300 deaths arose from the 2015 fires alone. 

 Fire detection is traditionally carried out on foot, which is inherently very slow and person\-intensive. Having reached the fire\-zone, it can take large, experienced fire crews many hours of walking in near\-zero visibility to pinpoint the fire location, especially when burning underground. This leads to prolonged exposure to extremely dense and harmful smoke inhalation, and horrific injuries by inadvertently standing and falling into fires burning underground. Drones have been tried as a potential solution to overcome these problems, but visible wavelength cameras cannot detect fires through smoke and vegetation, particularly for fires that burn underground. 

 Our research showed that our drone plus thermal infrared camera system can easily identify peat fires burning both underground and through the smoke – current fundamental bottlenecks in stopping the fires – from large distances. In September 2019 we delivered a thermal drone system to our Indonesian collaborators, and it has subsequently been used by fire\-fighting teams in the Central Kalimantan province \(the region often containing the most numerous, widespread and severe fires\). For each fire, the fire\-fighters recorded the GPS location, how long it took to extinguish, the number of person working days needed to tackle it, and the total area burnt. We asked our collaborators \[the Borneo Nature Foundation \(BNF\), government agencies, universities and fire\-fighting teams\] for a joint letter quantifying the impact our system has had on finding and extinguishing fires. 

 In this letter, Bernat Capilla, Director of Programs at BNF, states, “… the overwhelmingly positive feedback from fire\-fighting teams and their desire for thermal drones to attend all possible fire events, attests to this positive impact. This derives from an increased ability and speed of  detecting fires \(compared to checking on foot, which is dangerous and may take many hours for a large fire, we estimate that use of a thermal drone allows fire hotspot location mapping to be completed around at least 10x quicker and with almost no safety risk\), which in turn improves the ability of teams to monitor the current fire situation and deploy team members as necessary to prevent fire spread and extinguish hotspots. … The technology is also particularly useful in surveying fire sites post\-initial fire\-fighting, to confirm that all hotspots are extinguished and it is safe to leave the site, again increasing the speed of this by at least 10x. This is vitally important, as peat fires can smoulder beneath the surface, where they are difficult to detect without the aid of thermal imaging technology, and then re\-emerge after fire\-fighters have gone home, causing more damage.” Further quantitative impacts are summarised below. 

 Impact 1 – **Increased efficiency in finding/extinguishing fires**: The fire\-fighters estimate that compared to traditional methods, our drone system accurately identifies the location of the fires over 10x quicker, helps extinguish them 50% quicker and makes it over 10x quicker to confirm fires are extinguished. 

 Impact 2 – **Substantial reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> released into the atmosphere**: Using the known amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that peat fires in the Kalimantan region emit per unit area \(Setyawati & Suwarsono, 2018, IOPConf.Ser.: Earth.Environ.Sci. 166012041\) and the spread rate of smouldering peat fires \(Prat\-Guitart et al., International Journal of Wildland Fire 2016, 25, 456–465\), on average, the fires that were tackled released 1 ton of CO<sub>2</sub> \(equivalent to 2 trans\-Atlantic flights\) per hour. Given the increased efficiencies described above, our drone system conservatively saves 3 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> from being emitted per fire. In October 2019, the fire\-teams extinguished 26 fires using the drone. We are therefore saving roughly 78 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> \(156 trans\-Atlantic flights worth\) from entering the atmosphere per drone system per month. 

 Impact 3 – **Improved health of firefighters and surrounding population**: the increased efficiency in finding/extinguishing the fires led to \(i\) virtually zero exposure to the previous safety risks finding fires; \(ii\) 200 days less smoke inhalation for the fire fighters, the effects of which are known to be extremely harmful; \(iii\) a corresponding drop in the concentration of toxic haze which had to be endured by the \~15 million Kalimantan province residents. 

 Impact of COVID\-19: In 2020 we intended to bring additional drone systems with new automated fire\-detection capability to additional fire teams in Indonesia. We believe this would have significantly increased the above impacts. However, COVID\-19 travel restrictions meant it was not possible to deliver the systems.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by the University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) in collaboration with Intel and Fujitsu has produced a ground\-breaking novel architecture for high\-performance computing \(HPC\) used, for example, in meteorological forecasting. UoE researchers worked with an existing Intel product \(non\-volatile RAM technology Optane DCPMM\) to create a system of hardware and software named NEXTGenIO, that can be used for intensive memory storage. Fujitsu commercialised the resulting prototype into their new HPC server lines which have sold to multiple organisations, including Japan’s Meteorological Research Institute. German system integration company SVA also used the research to attract approximately \[text removed for publication\] worth of new contracts. In further impact, the research led to software strategy changes for the European Centre for Medium\-Range Weather Forecasts, permanently altering the way the centre’s weather forecasts are created.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Reading and writing data, in short referred to as I/O, can present a key performance bottleneck when scaling memory\- and data\-intensive applications on supercomputers. University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) researchers Adrian Jackson, Michèle Weiland, and Mark Parsons \(Personal Chair in High Performance Computing\) managed the development of the NEXTGenIO computing platform that accelerates I/O for high\-performance computing \(HPC\) scientific and data applications. The NEXTGenIO platform was the key output of the UoE\-led H2020 project Next Generation I/O for the Exascale \(01/10/2015 – 30/09/2019\). It exploits a new generation of byte\-addressable non\-volatile random\-access memory \(NVRAM\). Jointly developed by Intel and Micron, the new NVRAM technology is known as Optane Data Center Persistent Memory \(DCPMM\). 

 The raw I/O performance of this NVRAM technology is extremely high – orders of magnitude better than even the fastest solid state disk – and although slower than conventional RAM, it has much greater capacity \(on the order of TBs\), and can maintain data without power being supplied to it. The UoE researchers developed methods to make DCPMM usable in HPC applications. The research was centered around the design and development of a platform architecture that exploits the new hardware, as well as the system software architectures to support that hardware, based on the requirements of scientific and data\-intensive computing applications \[3.1\]. 

 DCPMM can be used in both memory and storage modes depending on how it is addressed. To enable users to make use of this functionality without being forced to make fundamental changes to the implementation of their HPC applications, the platform architecture must support secure application\- and user\-level access to both modes without requiring elevated system privileges. Additionally, the storage is local to individual compute notes, raising the challenge of access in a distributed HPC system. 

 The architecture developed by the UoE researchers includes software for data movement and management that enables node\-local storage to be used by applications across compute nodes, and the development of new scheduling technologies that reduce the need to reconfigure the storage modes on individual nodes – an operation that takes 30 minutes. The research also developed methods to improve the efficiencies of end\-to\-end user workflows in the presence of NVRAM, through intelligently scheduling jobs to minimize the data movement between nodes, in accordance with workflow dependencies. Taken as a whole, these innovations enable applications to exploit performance benefits of NVRAM without significant changes or in\-depth knowledge of the hardware \[3.2\]. 

 Evaluations of the platform showed that there are significant performance and energy efficiency benefits for memory and I/O intensive applications, demonstrated across workloads including weather forecasting, computational fluid dynamics, and material modelling \[3.3, 3.4\]. 

 For example, using DCPMM with the NEXTGenIO system software, weather forecasting applications, such as the European Centre for Medium\-Range Weather Forecasts’ IFS forecasting model, no longer experience any performance slowdown due to I/O operations, as data movement requirements of the forecasting software can be fully absorbed by the hardware – in contrast to using a network attached parallel file system. The demonstrated I/O bandwidth \(i.e. the amount of data that can be transferred per second\) enabled by the NEXTGenIO system architecture already supports the requirements of future generations of the IFS forecasting application that are only projected to be used in production within the 2025 timescale. Therefore, when utilizing this hardware, I/O is no longer a bottleneck for weather forecasting applications – not only in the current setting but for many years into the future. These features, unique to the NEXTGenIO architecture, have paved the way for the development of ground\-breaking new products, which are now altering the possibilities for supercomputing in a range of fields, including weather forecasting and drug development. 

 The NEXTGenIO platform has now been commercialised by Fujitsu in their latest range of HPC servers.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Through the NEXTGenIO platform, the University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) team’s development of system architectures to support NVRAM enabled innovative products to be created for the supercomputing market, and led to commercial success for a number of companies, including Fujitsu, Intel, and SVA. 

 Fujitsu credits this work with enabling it to launch two server lines with capabilities unique to its business, ahead of the competition, and to subsequently reap commercial gain. Fujitsu states: 

 *\[text removed for publication\]* \[5.1\] 

 In 2019, Fujitsu launched the following server lines, incorporating the NEXTGenIO technology \[5.1\]: 

-  PRIMERGY server models: TX2550 M5, RX2530 M5, RX2540 M5, RX4770 M5, CX2560 M5, CX2550 M5 and CX2570 M5 

-  PRIMEQUEST server models: PQ3800E2 and PQ3800B2 

 Fujitsu described the servers as “breakthrough”, emphasizing their ability to speed up research discoveries and to model complex systems more accurately \[5.2\]. In their press material, Fujitsu explained that the UoE research enabled the company to build “an entirely new generation of computing platforms with the speed and performance required to power tomorrow’s data\-intensive and real\-time applications” \[5.2, penultimate para.\]. In particular, the company cites the high performance of the NEXTGenIO platform, alongside its low power consumption, as a significant feature \[5.3, para. 7\]. The uniqueness of the product has given Fujitsu a significant market edge, enabling the company to bring new HPC server models to the market ahead of their competitors \[5.1\]. 

 To date, multiple large\-scale PRIMERGY and PRIMEQUEST servers have been sold to specialist institutes in Japan and Australia, where they form the basis of supercomputers used in modelling and simulation \[5.4, 5.5\]. Their end purpose applications are varied and include medical diagnoses, autonomous driving technology \[5.4, para. 4\] and vaccine development in relation to the COVID\-19 pandemic. \[5.5, para. 6\] In Australia, Gadi – a Fujitsu\-server powered HPC utilising the NEXTGenIO technology – has achieved the country’s highest ranking in the Global supercomputer index \(25\), and is reported to be eight times more powerful than its predecessor \[5.5, paras. 1, 9\]. 

 In March 2020 Fujitsu announced the sale of their PRIMERGY CX2550 M5 server \(which utilises the NEXTGenIO technology\) to Japan's Meteorological Research Institute \(JMRI\), as part of a custom\-built HPC architecture the company was commissioned to construct \[5.3\]. The institute uses supercomputing technology in the prediction of global warming, earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes. JMRI’s Senior Director stated that the new architecture meets the institute’s needs “to accurately predict storm and heavy rain associated with typhoons as well as local downpours including linear precipitation zones that cause major disasters.” \[5.3, final para.\] 

 Positive commercial impact has also cascaded down to Fujitsu client SVA, a German system integration company. SVA states \[text removed for publication\] \[5.6, para. 3\]. The company reports attracting approximately \[text removed for publication\] of contracts, by using the DCPMM architecture infrastructure and the NEXTGenIO platform long before their competitors were able to harness such niche knowledge in the HPC field. \[text removed for publication\] \[5.6, paras. 4\-5\]. 

 Intel reaped similar commercial gains, benefitting from the opportunity to refine an existing product – their DCPMM technology, originally designed for business computing – for an entirely new market in HPC. Significantly, the research project enabled Intel to experiment with the technology before its release, leading \(as with Fujitsu\) to a notable market advantage. The company states that: 

 *\[text removed for publication\]* \[5.7, para. 4\] 

 In addition to its positive commercial impacts, the NEXTGenIO research has benefitted public services and accelerated strategy changes in professional practice. 

 The European Centre for Medium\-Range Weather Forecasts \(ECMWF\) changed the strategy of its processes to monitor and predict weather, as a result of the enhanced capabilities offered by the NEXTGenIO architecture. ECMWF is the world leader in medium\-range weather prediction, and states that NEXTGenIO has had “significant impact” on its software strategy and will “clearly affect its next supercomputer procurement” \[5.8, para. 11\]. 

 Following the research, “ECMWF has been able to prove that such a platform can deliver staggering performance improvements…in particular for complex workflows…” \[5.8, para. 8\]. ECMWF calculates that the research project has generated cost savings in infrastructure investment and maintenance, and has enabled it to tighten its operational schedules, targets which “did not seem achievable” before NEXTGenIO \[5.8, paras. 9\-10\]. Software developments achieved during the project have already changed the running of weather forecasts at ECMWF, and the technology is now being used to facilitate a rolling archive of real\-time climate monitoring data \[5.8, para 11\]. 

 NEXTGenIO has created a chain of impact that starts with its economic benefits to multinational technological companies, and through those companies’ clients, demonstrates HPC performances formerly not thought possible.

-  A ten\-fold reduction in the use of hip resurfacing in men 

-  A 50% increase in use of unicompartmental knee replacements 

-  Increased utilisation of spinal anaesthetic and posterior surgical approach to the hip in order to decrease post\-operative mortality 

-  Change in patient care pathways to reduce pain, improve function and adopt cost\-effective treatments 

 These changes have led to a substantial reduction in revision rates \(by approximately half\) for hip and knee replacements in England and Wales, as captured by the National Joint Registry, decreased risk of mortality for patients undergoing joint replacement and improved patient outcomes.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Research at the University of Bristol \(UoB\) has changed the practice of joint replacement worldwide through a comprehensive programme of research using a combination of research methods centred on the National Joint registry \(NJR\) for England and Wales. In addition, the research team have developed and implemented methods for monitoring surgeon, unit and implant performance, thereby ensuring iterative and ongoing improvement in the delivery of care. 

1.  *Identification of failing implants* 

 UoB research published in 2012 \(1\), revealed catastrophically high failure rates in stemmed metal\-on\-metal hip replacements, as well as in hip resurfacing in women. This led to the worldwide abandoning of these procedures. Further research conducted by the research team in 2018 found that this type of hip replacement was responsible for over 8,000 excess revision procedures at a cost of over GBP100 million in England and Wales alone. 

1.  *Identifying the most clinically and cost\-effective implants* 

 There is large variation in performance between different implants that are commonly used for joint replacement. The research team utilised network meta\-analysis and health economic modelling \(2\) to determine that the most clinically and cost\-effective implants for hip replacement are implants fixed with cement and use small diameter heads. Using these implants for all patients would save between GBP252 million to GBP281 million in England and Wales in the next decade. The NJR annual reports show an ongoing decline in usage of less effective and cost\-effective uncemented hip replacement stems. 

1.  *Reducing perioperative mortality for patients undergoing hip and knee replacement* 

 The research team demonstrated that partial knee replacements were associated with a lower risk of mortality than total knee replacement \(3\) and that they lasted on average over 25 years \(4\). This led to the increased utilisation of partial knee replacements. The research team’s publications in The Lancet \(3, 5\) showed that chemical and mechanical thromboprophylaxis, spinal anaesthetic and the posterior surgical approach for the hip, all reduce the risk of mortality for patients undergoing joint replacement. NJR data show a continuous increase in use of these three co\-interventions. 

1.  *Reducing pain after joint replacement* 

 Approximately 20% of patients experience long\-term pain after hip and knee replacement. The UoB research has demonstrated that the injection of local anaesthetic around the surgical site during joint replacement leads to decreased long\-term pain after hip, but not knee, replacement and has also established the cost\-effectiveness of this intervention for hip replacement \(6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 According to the World Health Organisation, musculoskeletal conditions are the leading contributor to global disability. In the UK, treatment consumes 30% of NHS primary care consultations and 25% of surgical interventions. Two of the most common interventions are hip and knee replacement, with over 100,000 each performed in England and Wales annually. Hip and knee replacement rates range between 150 and 300 each per 100,000 in developed countries. Annual NHS expenditure on hip and knee replacements is over GBP1 billion and over GBP3 billion in the United States. 

 Around 10% of joint replacements fail, requiring complex revision surgery, and 20% of patients experience long\-term pain. NICE provide recommendations on implants used in joint replacement, surgical approaches and the use of injections around the surgical site on the basis of the UoB research in order to reduce revision rates, improve outcomes and decrease pain. The UoB research showing that metal\-on\-metal hip replacements should not be used, and will avoid 8,000 excess revisions, led to the virtual cessation of the use of these implants in the UK, Australia and Canada by 2018. 

#  1. Identifying failing implants and changing practice 

 NICE identifies acceptable revision rates as 5% at 10 years; the research team found rates far in excess of this when metal\-on\-metal stemmed hip replacements \(1\) and hip resurfacings were used. This led to the MHRA issuing a Medical Device Alert \[Ai\], reinforced by the British Orthopaedic Association and British Hip Society \[Aii\], recommending against their use in all but exceptional circumstances and that targeted surveillance should occur for any such recipients. The NICE Technology appraisal guidance \[Ci\] cites UoB’s work \(1\) and evidence from the NJR annual reports \[B\], in its recommendations on revision rates and implants for hip replacement. 

 The US Food and Drugs Administration has cited UoB’s research \(1\) and further work on the risk of cancer following implantation of metal\-on\-metal hip implants in its recommendations on market approval for hip replacements \(FDA 2013\) and Biological Response to Metal Implants \[D\]. The FDA now approves no stemmed metal\-on\-metal hip replacement systems and only two resurfacing systems for marketing in the US. Of those approved, one has strictly limited indications in the manufacturer Field Safety Notice informed by UoB’s recommendations and findings. The New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority \(2013\) and the European Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks \(2014\) \[E\], have issued guidance citing UoB’s research on the outcomes of metal\-on\-metal hip replacements, including research on the risk of developing cancer, in their recommendations. 

 Prior to publication of UoB’s research \(1\), over 1 million metal\-on\-metal total hip and resurfacing implants were implanted worldwide. The research team identified that the use of approximately 70,000 of these implants in the NJR were responsible for 8,000 excess revisions, at a cost of over GBP100 million. This equates to over 110,000 avoidable revisions worldwide. UoB’s recommendations have led to the virtual cessation of the use of these implants \(UK: 466 in 2018 vs 13,630 in 2008 \[B\]; Australia: 1% \(2013\-2018\) vs 9.8% \(2006\-2012\) \(peak 17% 2007\) \[F\]\). Citing UoB’s work, the FDA recommends the use of Unique Device Identifiers \[G\] to allow monitoring and prevent recurrence of the devastating impact of these implants. The NJR, for which the research team have been responsible for statistical analysis and specialist research for over a decade, was cited as a “global exemplar” of medical device registries by the Under Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Jo Churchill MP, in her report to Parliament \(2020\). 

#  2. Identifying the most clinically and cost\-effective implants 

 The research on the cost\-effectiveness of hip implants \(2\) has informed recommendations of the Analysis and Policy Observations \(APO\) of Australia and New Zealand 2019 \[Hi\], and the research on how long hip replacements last has been cited by the Dutch Institute of Health \[Hii\]. In the UK, the Getting it Right First Time \(GIRFT\) initiative is a leading NHS Improvement programme. Data utilised by GIRFT are provided by the UoB team’s analysis of NJR data \[I\]. The programme has adopted UoB’s recommendations in terms of implant selection \(2, 5\) \[I\], and change in clinical practice is demonstrated by data from the NJR which demonstrate increased use of cemented stems and abandonment of larger heads \[B\]. If all hip replacements performed were conducted as cemented hip replacements, this would save between GBP252 million and GBP281 million in England and Wales alone over the next decade. The success of the GIRFT programme, underpinned by UoB data, has seen it rolled out across all surgical specialties in the UK. 

#  3. Improved patient care and reduced perioperative mortality 

 The UoB research has explored treatment factors that are associated with peri\-operative mortality for patients undergoing hip and knee replacement. The research \(1\) was cited by NICE Technology Appraisal guidance \[TA304\] \(2014\) providing evidence\-based recommendations on artificial hips and hip resurfacing for treating end‑stage arthritis of the hip in adults \[Ci\], specifically in making recommendations aimed at decreasing peri\-operative mortality. The latest NICE guidance on hip and knee replacement \[Cii\] cites the UoB research on surgical approaches and anaesthesia to improve outcomes for patients undergoing joint replacement. These recommendations have been widely adopted as demonstrated by NJR data, showing an increase in the use of mechanical and chemical thromboprophylaxis and the use of spinal anaesthetic for total hip replacement \[B\]. In 2011, prior to the UoB team’s published research, the percentage of patients not receiving chemical prophylaxis for hip replacement was 13% \(\~ 13,000 patients\); this fell to 2% in 2019. For knee replacement, the proportion not receiving chemical prophylaxis fell from 15% \(\~ 15,000 patients\) in 2011 to 1% in 2019. The proportion of patients undergoing hip replacement who received a spinal anaesthetic in the period 2008\-2012 was 42%, increasing to 59% in the period 2013\-2017 \(\~17,000 more cases per annum\); the corresponding proportions for knee replacement were 43% and 57% respectively \(\~ 15,000 cases per annum\) \[B\]. Also, 90\-day mortality rates have decreased by 7% in hip replacement and 10% for knee replacement in the period 2014 to 2019 \[B\]. 

#  4. Reducing pain after joint replacement 

 The UoB publications showing the efficacy of peri\-operative wound infiltration in reducing post\-operative pain \(6\) have contributed to widespread adoption of these techniques, particularly in rapid recovery pathways. The research team’s work was cited in guidance from the Canadian Agency for Drugs Technology and Health \[J\] and NICE guideline NG157 \[Cii\] in the UK, with NICE now recommending peri\-operative wound infiltration in all patients.

#  Summary of the impact 

 Post\-weaning disorders, diarrhoea, dehydration and nutrient malabsorption in early weaned piglets results in approximately 30,000,000 deaths annually worldwide. Our research has addressed this problem through scientifically validated formulation of innovative plant\-based sweeteners \(e.g. TakTik®\). We have shown that sweeteners are detected by an intestinal glucose \(sweet\) receptor activating a pathway leading to increased glucose, electrolyte, and water absorption \(oral rehydration\). University of Liverpool research findings attracted the feed additive company Pancosma/ADM who approached Shirazi\-Beechey in 2008 and funded the subsequent research. This development has i\) led to 22% of all piglets worldwide currently consuming a TakTik® product, ii\) improved health and survival rate by increasing weight, immunity and optimisation of feed utilisation, and iii\) created significant economic benefits for Pancosma/ADM with sweetener sales increasing from \[text removed for publication\] in 2014 to \[text removed for publication\] in 2018. 
","
#  Underpinning research 

 In intensive pig production, piglets are weaned at 3 to 4 weeks of age when gut structure and function are not fully developed. This practice allows more piglets to be born, but leads to disorders including nutrient malabsorption, diarrhoea and consequent malnutrition and dehydration, accounting for approximately 3% mortality \(equivalent to 30,000,000 piglets annually\). Feed additives that improve animal health and performance are significant to animal welfare and economics. 

 Fundamental underpinning research led by Professor Shirazi\-Beechey, funded by the Wellcome Trust at the University of Liverpool, for the first time identified an intestinal glucose \(sweet\) receptor \[ **3.1**\] that influences glucose absorptive capacity \[ **3.2**\]. Activation of the receptor by sugars and non\-nutritive \(artificial\) sweeteners results in i\) enhancement in activity/expression of the intestinal glucose transporter \(Na<sup>\+</sup>/glucose cotransporter 1, SGLT1\) increasing gut capacity to absorb glucose, electrolytes and water \[ **3.2**\] and ii\) secretion of the gut hormone, glucagon\-like peptide 2, enhancing gut structural maturity \[ **3.3**\]. Our subsequent research demonstrated that pig intestine expresses the glucose \(sweet\) receptor, and that Sucram 150 \(a Pancosma brand sweetener containing saccharin and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone \[NHDC\]\) enhances activity/expression of SGLT1 when included in feed or drinking water. Gut tissue growth is also improved, as well as its capacity to absorb glucose \[ **3.4**\] thereby maximising feed utilisation and promoting weight gain. Moreover, NHDC induces propagation of gut probiotic *Lactobacillus*, enhancing immunity and gut health \[ **3.5**\]. 

 **Development of Sucram\-based product range, TakTik® \(1<sup>st</sup> August 2013 \- present\)** 

 Restrictions imposed by the EU on the use of saccharin in animal feed has stimulated interest in developing new plant derived sweeteners for inclusion in animal feed. Our research has enabled the development of next generation Sucram sweetener and the TakTik® range incorporating stevia\-based sweeteners. The novelty in the research relied on assessing the specificity of sweetener compounds in activating the intestinal glucose \(sweet\) receptor through species\-specific amino acid sequence modifications in receptor binding sites for various artificial/natural sweeteners. These findings allowed us to develop novel plant\-based sweeteners to be commercialised using similar research strategies for application to the rearing of other species including ruminants, rabbits, and fish \[ **3.6**\].

#  Details of the impact 

##  Impact on practice and knowledge 

 Our research since 2013 has changed the practice of the animal feed additive industry. By applying our scientific knowledge, we have shown that there are species\-specific modifications in receptor binding sites for sweeteners, allowing for the development of novel, effective and targeted products. This is a major advance from previous empirical\-based approaches that were used routinely by the industry, often leading to ineffective products \[ **5.1**\]. Our research has also substantially changed the fundamental understanding of the mode of action of sweeteners used in animal nutrition. Rather than being non\-specific ‘palatants’, at low concentrations \(0.01%\), stevia\-based sweeteners used in TakTik® products are potent activators of the intestinal glucose \(sweet\) receptor, approximately 1,000 fold more active than glucose. 

##  Impact on animal health and welfare 

 Shirazi\-Beechey’s research in developing science\-based and Regulatory approved sweetener products has had major impacts on increasing food intake, weight, and optimisation of food conversion ratio \(i.e. quantity of feed consumed divided by weight gained\), in early weaned piglets, impacting health and well\-being of the animals concerned.

 Figure 1: is an example of an independent field trial demonstrating that inclusion of the new sweetener in the feed increased feed intake and body weight gain by approximately 6% and 5% respectively, and improved feed utilisation as demonstrated by the substantial reduction in feed conversion ratio compared to controls \[ **5.2**\]. 


 In support of such impacts, the Technical Sales Manager of Pancosma, China states “ *many Chinese animal feed customers use TakTik® as an alternative to routine antibiotics for piglets, and based on the feedback from the Chinese market, this results in significant reduction in post\-weaning diarrhoea, and improvements in health. Our customers have carried out large feeding trials of TakTik®, but they consider the data confidential and not available to the public. But the fact that we have doubled the sales figure for TakTik® in China and our Chinese customers continue purchasing TakTik® are good indications of the effectiveness of our products*” \[ **5.3**\]. 

 The Director of Swine Research at the animal feed company Purina, USA, comments that “ *the fundamental knowledge gained through research carried out by Shirazi\-Beechey, that such additives improve health and well\-being of early weaned piglets, has stimulated the inclusion of sweeteners in piglet’s feed worldwide*” \[ **5.4**\]. A University of Illinois Professor of Applied Swine Nutrition and an authority on swine nutrient requirements states that Shirazi\-Beechey’s research “ *has made substantive contribution to efficient production of animal source foods, and the research findings leading to rapid increase in global use of sweetener products indicate that advantages extend beyond Pancosma to pig and pig producers. Pig producers do not buy, or continue to buy, products unless they are convinced those products benefits their business*” \[ **5.5**\]. 

 The importance of the role of TakTik® product on pig gut development has received wide industry recognition including high profile articles in pig industry journals \[ **5.2**, **5.6**\]. 

##  Economic impact and impact on commercial uptake 

 Research carried out by Shirazi\-Beechey has had significant economic impacts on the pig production industry and the feed additive company Pancosma/ADM, with whom Shirazi\-Beechey has collaborated. Shirazi\-Beechey’s research has enhanced customers’ understanding of the underlying mechanisms and benefits of new sweetener products in piglet feed, thereby increasing the sale of TakTik® product. This has had major economic benefits for Pancosma. 

 Pancosma has recognised the importance of the work carried out by Liverpool in promoting their products \[ **5.2**, **5.6**\]. Since 2014, annual income due to sales of the sweetener has more than doubled from \[text removed for publication\] in 2014 to \[text removed for publication\] in 2018. In 2014 sweetener sales amounted to 80t per annum with an increase to 160t in 2018 \[ **5.7**\]. 

 Considering that each piglet consumes approximately 8kg of feed, containing 0.8g of sweetener, during the weaning period \(from 21 to 42 days of age\), the increase in annual sales of 80t of the sweetener amounts to an additional 100,000,000 piglets consuming TakTik® product per year. 

 Regarding percentage of piglets in the world consuming the sweetener in 2018; 160t of sweetener equate to a total of 200,000,000 pigs consuming TakTik® product. It is reported that in 2018, there were approximately 900,000,000 piglets born, meaning approximately 22% of all piglets worldwide currently consume TakTik® product. 

##  Additional economic benefits 

 Shirazi\-Beechey’s fundamental research into the underlying molecular mechanisms of intestinal sweet perception has changed Pancosma’s approach to delivering science\-led innovations globally \(Pancosma is represented in 75 countries\) with a corporate focus on gut health. Pancosma CEO \(until 2016\) has commented on this science\-led approach “ *which has contributed to development of new concepts and products resulting in commercial success*” \[ **5.8**\]. Whilst the more recent Pancosma CEO, states \[ **5.8**\] that “ *Shirazi\-Beechey’s research has had a tangible impact on multi\-million Euro business of Pancosma products and that industry needs such scientific challenges in order to better design and develop the solution of tomorrow’s challenges*”. The present Pancosma Research Director for Feed Additives has commented “ *the scientific support provided by Shirazi\-Beechey has been a major cornerstone of palatants’ range development and has promoted for the first time the gut effect of sweetener products*”. She has also acknowledged Shirazi\-Beechey’s research contribution to the development of new Pancosma range TakTik®, as well as next generation Sucram products \[ **5.7**\]. 

 These effects are being felt more widely in the industry. Several global animal feed companies, for example CP Group \(Thailand\) and Grupo\-Nutec \(Mexico\), have incorporated TakTik® into their products. The global animal feed company, Cargill, states that “ *this is an excellent example of how relatively ‘deep’ science can have a very close connection with, and impact on, practical animal agriculture. The knowledge that sweeteners trigger molecular pathways is leading to industrial realisation that the research outputs are relevant to other major aspects of agriculture, including the dairy industry*” \[ **5.9**\]. 

 In recognition of her exceptional contributions, the American Society of Animal Science awarded Prof. Shirazi\-Beechey the ASAS President’s Award for International Achievement in Animal Science \(2018\) \[ **5.10**\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Bowel cancer has become the third most prevalent cancer in China, with >375,000 new cancers/year and \~190,000 deaths/year. Barriers to early detection include the lack of accurate and sensitive screening tests. To overcome this, UofG research developed the first, digital home\-based bowel screening test, produced by UofG spin\-out company, ModeDx. Oxford MEStar acquired ModeDx \(2016\) and developed the test for Chinese markets, led by UofG’s Prof Cooper, as Advisory Board Chair. Having passed clinical trials, gained CE marking and Chinese National Medical Products Administration approval, the device is being mass\-produced as a digital health screening product to address the rising challenge of recent growth in bowel cancer prevalence, attributed to China’s aging population and a more westernised lifestyle with increased dietary fat, obesity and physical inactivity.

1.  **Underpinning research** 

 The Advanced Medical Diagnostics Group in the School of Engineering has developed new biosensors technologies, based upon electrochemical systems. Led by Prof. Jon Cooper, this research started in 1999, supported by a GBP3.2 million DTI\-EPSRC Foresight LINK ""Lab on a Chip"" programme. The project was coordinated by Dr Derek Craston \(now The UK’s Government Chemist\) and was carried out in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline \(GSK\), Unilever and Kodak together with a group of small and medium\-sized enterprises, including Epigem. 

 During this period, Cooper's research enabled the development of new, advanced microfabrication techniques for microfluidic on\-chip sensing and interconnect technologies for microfludics. Subsequently working with Prof Cumming’s research group, Cooper integrated the biosensing technologies into analytical microfluidic devices, with low\-power complementary metal\-oxide\-semiconductor \(CMOS\) application\-specific integrated circuits \(ASICs\) for both veterinary and medical diagnostic as well as cell\-based assays \[3.1\]. 

 Following this research, Profs Cooper and Cumming investigated the use of sensors and optimised packaging in a fully functional, ingestible prototype pill\-like diagnostic device. This work and the earlier DTI\-EPSRC research, was instrumental in producing a pill\-based sensor device \[3.2\-3.4\], composed of two sensors that measured pH and temperature, reflecting the physiological environment in the gastrointestinal tract \(as indicators for disease\) \[3.2\]. Each sensor was controlled by an ASIC, that incorporated a power saving serial bitstream data compression algorithm that was found to extend the lifetime of the pill by 70%. An integrated radio transmitter was used to send the signal to a local receiver, prior to acquisition on a computer. A permanent magnet was also incorporated in the device to enable non\-visual tracking of the system within the gastrointestinal tract. 

 The pill\-based sensor presented challenges when ingested, but the underpinning circuit research \[3.1\-3.4\] and radiotelemetry sensor design \[3.2, 3.3\] were applicable to the development of sensors that could be incorporated into devices to detect blood in stool \(an indicator of bowel cancer\). Adaptation of the existing pill\-based sensor for use in a bowel cancer screening device was inspired by a GBP1,390,000 ‘Integrated Diagnostics for Environmental and Analytical Systems’ grant awarded by the Scottish Funding Council \(2000\). 

 This led Prof Cooper to develop intellectual property and design and develop the first digital home\-based bowel screening test, using the blood’s peroxidase activity. In short, haemoglobin, present in blood catalysed redox electrochemical reactions that could be detected at the biosensor using the miniaturised ASIC previously developed. As a result, UofG spin\-out company, ModeDx, was launched in 2008 to commercialise the diagnostic product **me**asure® BOWEL HEALTH which became available for sale across the UK \(with the devices eventually being marketed and sold on the high street through Boots, and on\-line through Amazon\).

1.  **Details of the impact** 

 
UofG spin\-out company, ModeDx, was launched in 2008 to commercialise **me**asure® BOWEL HEALTH. Despite the product showing potential and achieving sales online and in the high street, investors recommended adapting it for use in the rapidly emerging healthcare market in China. In 2016, ModeDx and the IP/technology underpinning the **me**asure® BOWEL HEALTH device were acquired by Oxford MEStar \(a company that enables the translation of products and services from the UK to China\). Acknowledging Cooper’s expertise and the technology he developed at UofG, Oxford MEStar invited Cooper to take the role of Chair of the Advisory Board, where he plays a key leadership role in the continuing development of **me**asure® \[5.1 page 3\]. The impact arising from Cooper’s research at UofG is primarily commercial – a successful spin\-out company was created, which following its acquisition, has contributed to innovation in China through the design of new products to address barriers to bowel cancer screening. 

 The commercial value of the technology underpinning the UofG device was highlighted by a successful funding round in 2014 \[5.2\], which followed GBP600,000 of funding in 2010 \[5.3\] and GBP1,100,000 in 2012 \[5.4\]. In February 2014, ModeDx announced that it had received a European CE mark for the **me**asure® BOWEL HEALTH product, and that it had successfully completed a significant funding round led by new investor, Longwall Venture Partners. Following securing the funding to develop the company, the Head of the Scottish Investment Bank \(SIB\), commented, “ *SIB, through its Scottish Venture Fund, is delighted to further support this ambitious Scottish life sciences company. MODE has shown a commitment to innovation and the development of new products that enhance healthcare provision, and we are pleased to be able to build on previous Scottish Enterprise support from SMART:SCOTLAND to help them accelerate their growth plans*” \(2014\) \[5.2\]. The CE Certification was received following review by an external notified body and enabled MODE to *“sell **me**asure® into the ‘over the counter’ home healthscreening market”*. The approval followed MODE’s earlier achievement of ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 quality management systems \[5.2\]. 

 At the time of acquisition, Oxford MEStar was quoted in a press release: *“We are excited about the long\-term commercial potential of using this technology. We believe the IP developed by Mode, a proprietary electrochemical detection technology, is an important component that we can use to develop handheld test devices manufactured at low cost and in high volumes… We will continue to work in partnership with the University of Glasgow and maintain a corporate presence in Scotland”* \[5.5\]. 

 A key commercial goal of Oxford MEStar is to bridge the gap between UK biotech companies and Chinese markets. Oxford MEStar reported: *“We believe there is enormous potential in this market for China; the current technology in China is not restrained by a lack of funding, but its lack of advanced technology and resources, which are readily available to Oxford MEStar. We are equipped with the right resources, and an abundance of knowledge and expertise to bring British bio\-businesses and technology to the Chinese healthcare market”  \[5.6\]. By acquiring the technology developed by Cooper and working with the UofG, Oxford MEStar has been able to meet its commercial goal of taking UK biotechnology advances to China \[5.6\]. Building on this goal, Oxford MEStar have further developed the device, with guidance from Cooper, to make it more suited to Chinese markets \[5.1\]. 

 
In China, the incidence of bowel cancer has risen in recent years \[5.1\], and while some countries have strong participation in bowel screening programmes, in Asia there is low public awareness and little support by health authorities for bowel screening. Following the acquisition of ModeDx, Oxford MEStar are now mass\-producing **me**asure® in China via Scottech Medical Co. Ltd \(Oxford MEStar’s sister company\), in Tianjin \[5.1 page 1\]. Building upon the original UofG research, an improved version of the product was developed for launch in China. In order to secure this place in the Chinese medical diagnostics market, Oxford MEStar carried out clinical trials in two hospitals in China \[5.1 page 2\]. These trials showed that **me**asure® can detect faecal occult blood, using the existing hospital\-based diagnostics as the gold standard/reference \[5.1 page 2\]. In December 2019, Cooper evaluated the results from these hospital trials, which represented a critical step in the device gaining Chinese Food and Drug Administration/NMPA approval \[5.1 page 2\]. The success of the **me**asure® product has directly led to Scottech Medical increasing its staff from 5 to 18 between 2016 and 2020 \[5.1 page 1\]. 

 Following **me**asure® being approved in China, Oxford MEStar are further developing the original UofG\-based technology to function with Bluetooth, creating new products that are compatible with smartphone and tablet apps \[5.1 page 3\]. This is an important adaptation made by Scottech Medical, enabling the device to fit with society’s changing needs around digital health and to make the device particularly useful in low\-resource areas and community health centres \[5.1 page 3\]. The versatility of the device is enabling adaptations to be made so that products remain at the forefront of technological advances, with Cooper’s leadership being crucial to the continued commercial viability of Scottech Medical \[5.1 page 3\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Brexit has more profound implications for children than virtually any other group. They will lose many of the special protections and support put in place by the EU. This has left EU migrant children in a particularly vulnerable position unless they regularise their immigration status under the EU Settlement Scheme \(EUSS\). 

 As the leading authority on EU children’s rights, Stalford’s research has directly responded to these concerns in four ways. First, in 2017 she **established a UK\-wide Brexit and Children Coalition** involving prominent civil society organisations, practitioners and academics to bring children’s rights issues to bear on the Brexit debates. Second, applying her unique methods to developing legal information for children, in 2019 Stalford was **appointed by the Home Office** **to** **design a communications strategy** to facilitate children’s awareness of and access to the EUSS. This work drew attention to particular groups of EU migrant children who are vulnerable to being left without legal status post\-Brexit. Third, these efforts **prompted the introduction of governmental EUSS guidance for looked after children** in 2019 and, fourth, **informed successful strategic litigation** and **calls for legislative amendment** to support EU children’s access to British citizenship. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Stalford’s research is distinguished by its socio\-legal analysis of EU law through the lens of children’s rights theory, law and methods. Her published work spanning over two decades, including her monograph \( **3.1**\), remain seminal reference points, offering a comprehensive, empirically\-grounded examination of the nature, scope and impact of EU law on children across a range of contexts. This research shows that: 

-  children benefit from specific, enhanced constitutional, legal and policy protection at EU level across a diverse range of areas, including cross\-border movement, online and offline exploitation and abuse, parental child abduction, and poverty and social exclusion. This is directly informed by international children’s rights law and principles, offering a crucial, additional layer of provision that is not otherwise available at UK domestic level \( **3.1 \- 3.3**\) 

-  The UK Government has failed to put resources in place – legally, politically, financially and procedurally – to guard against the potential repeal or dilution of existing EU provision available to children across these areas. This poses an immediate and potentially serious risk to children’s welfare and entitlement in the aftermath of Brexit \( **3.5 \- 3.6**\) 

 Stalford’s efforts to demonstrate the unique potential of European measures to advance children’s rights at the domestic level were supported by an ESRC grant to run a workshop series, ‘ *European Responses to Global Children’s Rights Issues: Building Capacity and Exchanging Knowledge’* \(GBP30,000, 2013\-2015\) *.* This was a two\-year interdisciplinary series which engaged practitioners, children’s rights organisations, Parliamentarians and fellow academics in exposing both the benefits and limitations of EU intervention in different areas. In doing so, **this work nurtured the necessary practitioner and civil society networks to support the establishment of the Brexit and Children Coalition and to maximize input into the Brexit debates** \( **3.3**\). 

 An important context for Stalford’s research has been the scope and application of children’s rights under EU free movement, immigration and asylum law. This work has charted how EU migrant children’s rights has evolved from being largely ‘parasitic’, dependent on and conflated with the rights of their parents, towards independent recognition and entitlement as citizens in their own right \( **3.1**\). This has enabled children to access a range of social, economic and cultural benefits across the EU, regardless of their parents’ migration status. A more recent development of this work has explored children’s access to the EU Settlement Scheme \(EUSS\), the new mandatory immigration status for EU migrants wishing to remain in the UK. **This research has revealed particular gaps for children \(in terms of awareness of and support with registration\), particularly those in care, children with criminal convictions** and **Roma children** \( **3.6**\). Drawing on Stalford’s earlier empirical work on EU family migration, childbearing, and residence, the research has pointed to the likely eligibility of a high proportion of EU migrant children for British citizenship \( **3.6\).** A more recent development of this work revealed that many families and children who are otherwise obliged to apply for EU settlement have no awareness of their eligibility for British citizenship and those that are aware have no recourse to the high fees \(in excess of GBP1,000\) required to fund such an application. This is particularly so for those on the economic and social margins, such as the EU Roma Community, leaving many with a less secure immigration status than that to which they are legally entitled \( **3.6**\). 

 Stalford’s wider children’s rights research has highlighted how **access to comprehensible information is an essential starting point for securing children’s enforcement of their rights in any legal context.** This hypothesis was initially tested out in a project funded by the Council of Europe to develop a child friendly version of its European Child Friendly Justice Guidelines \(2015\-16\). Through this work, **Stalford developed a new methodological approach to creating child friendly legal resources** which moved beyond simply re\-branding existing information in a ‘child friendly’ format towards gathering deeper insights directly from children and young people as to how they understand, articulate and experience the law \( **3.4**\).

#  **4. Details of the impact** 

 Stalford’s work has clarified and helped secure the legal status of children in a post Brexit UK in three respects: \(A\) by orienting Parliamentary debates and civil society campaigns about Brexit towards children; \(B\) by enhancing children’s awareness of and independent access to the EU Settlement Scheme; and \(C\) by providing evidence in support of litigation and legislative reform aimed at removing obstacles to British citizenship for children. 

 Impact on Parliamentary Debates and on Children’s Rights Organisations’ Brexit Campaign 

 Stalford’s detailed legal analysis of the nature and scope of children’s rights under EU law was instrumental in raising awareness of the potential implications of Brexit among Parliamentarians and others working in the field of children’s rights across the UK. 

 In the months leading up to the Brexit referendum, in January 2016 Stalford was appointed Special Adviser to the House of Lords \(HL\) Home Affairs EU sub\-committee in relation to their inquiry in the UK and EU’s response to unaccompanied asylum\-seeking children. She was working in Parliament when the referendum results were announced which enabled her to harness the links developed with Peers to draw attention to the specific implications of Brexit for children. She provided all of the materials and identified the priorities that shaped the first HL speeches drawing attention to the impact of Brexit on children \[ **5.1i & ii**\]. Baroness Massey who made these speeches refers to Stalford as *“a key player…who prepared documentation for Parliamentarians and other key decision makers at the beginning of the Brexit process”* and in making Ministers “ *aware of issues they knew very little about’.* The briefings prepared by Stalford were *“used in the House of Commons and the House of Lords to inform debates at second readings, committee stages and report stages of Bills”* \[ **5.2**\]. 

 Following these debates, mindful of the need for those working in the children’s rights sector to transmit clear, informed and consistent messages on the specific implications of Brexit for children, Stalford approached the Children’s Society, the Children’s Rights Alliance for England and Coram Children’s Legal Centre to establish a UK\-wide **Brexit and Children Coalition** in September 2017. The Coalition, which comprises over 30 organisations, practitioners and academics, was officially launched at a **cross\-party symposium in the House of Lords**, chaired by Helen Goodman MP \(13th Sept 2017\), attended by 60 representatives from all of the main political parties, as well as civil society organisations from across the UK, and the Children’s Commissioners of NI and Scotland. The symposium was followed by publication of the Coalition's first joint report, *Making Brexit Work for Children,* which set the scene for numerous subsequent Parliamentary debates and proposed amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill. In particular, Stalford’s ‘ *in\-depth understanding of the domestic and international legal framework’* \[policy director, Coram – **5.3**\] and *‘incisive analyses’* \[Baroness Massey, **5.1i\]** of the status of children’s rights at EU level informed recommendations for an explicit reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and retention of the EU Charter within the EU Withdrawal Bill \[ **5.1iii**\]. 

 Whilst the proposed amendments on children’s rights were not adopted as part of the EU Withdrawal Agreement, Ministers agreed to set out in more detailed terms their plans to protect children’s rights following Brexit \[ **5.1iv**\]. This resulted in a statement on 20th November 2018 by then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Children and Families. That statement reaffirmed the UK Government’s commitment to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and announced the launch of a new children’s rights training package and impact assessment template in collaboration with the Children’s Rights Alliance For England to support the development of law and policy across the different ministries **\[5.4\].** 

 Impact on children’s access to the EU Settlement Scheme \(EUSS\) 

 A particular priority for EU nationals currently residing in the UK is to retain residence rights by securing EU settled status under the EUSS.  Representing the Brexit and Children Coalition, Stalford attended two closed meetings/conference calls with the Department for Exiting the EU, the Department for Education and Home Office officials in September 2018 and November 2018 to raise concerns around gaps in protection for the estimated 900,000 children required to register under the EUSS. Stalford presented three specific recommendations to those departments: 

-  The EUSS is designed with adults rather than children in mind and needs to include adequate provision to ensure that vulnerable groups, including children in care and children with criminal convictions, can access the scheme; 

-  Additional training and resourcing should be available to advice providers, social workers, criminal justice professionals and Home Office decision\-makers to ensure that the EUSS is applied appropriately to children in light of their best interests; 

-  The Home Office should develop child targeted information to support children’s direct access to and understanding of the EUSS, particularly for those children whose parents are unable \(e.g. due to language or literacy issues such as the Roma\) to apply for EU settlement on their behalf. 

 These discussions led to the development of concrete guidance for Local Authorities on how to support looked after children in applying for the EUSS **\[5.5\].** 

 Building on this advice, and directly informed by her innovative methods of developing child focused legal information, the Home Office appointed Stalford to lead a UK\-wide consultation with children to develop an **EUSS Communications Strategy for Children** \(June 2019 \- December 2020\) **\[5.6\]**.This focused on facilitating EUSS registration for children vulnerable to falling through the gaps, such as those in care, those outside of mainstream education, those with special educational needs and Roma children. The project resulted in the production of a suite of hard copy and online child friendly information resources. The materials are the only child focused communications that have been approved by the Home Office and are designed for use by advice workers, parents, schools and children across the UK. They will be instrumental in enabling some of the most vulnerable EU migrant children \(over 400,000 eligible EU children have yet to apply for the EUSS as of December 2020\) to regularise their immigration status by the deadline of 30 June 2021. For instance, the Director of the Roma Support Group \(the main NGO supporting the Roma community across the UK\), attributes a rise in EU Roma awareness of and applications to the EUSS largely to Stalford’s targeted communications and awareness raising strategy among the Roma community **\[5.7\].** 

 Impact on EU Children’s Access to British Citizenship 

 Stalford drew on her research expertise, including the findings of her consultation with children in the course of the Home Office EUSS project, to evidence the high proportion of EU migrant children likely to qualify for British citizenship. Stalford was invited to present this evidence in the form of a **witness statement to support** **High Court strategic litigation** led by Amnesty International and the Project for the Registration of Children as British Nationals \( *R \(oao \(1\) The Project For The Registration Of Children As British Citizens, \(2\) O, a child, by her litigation friend, AO, and \(3\) A, a child, by her litigation friend, NJM\) Claimants v. Secretary Of State For The Home Department* \[2019\] EWHC 3536 \(Admin\) \[ **5.8**\]. This litigation led to the Court making a declaration that the Secretary of State had breached its duty to act in children’s best interests when setting such high fees. The research has also **informed** **Parliamentary lobbying** **in relation to the new Immigration and Social Security Co\-ordination \(EU Withdrawal\) Bill 2019\-2021**: ECRU issued a joint letter with the Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens \(PRCBC\), Amnesty International and others to the Home Office Minister urging him to facilitate EU children’s access to their British citizenship entitlement not least by removing prohibitive registration fees and obviating their requirement to register under the EUSS **\[5.9\-5.10\]**. ECRU’s research pointing to the distinct interests of EU Roma children in relation to British citizenship and EUSS registration were also **highlighted by Baroness Lister** in the House of Lords on 16 September 2020 to support the proposed amendments to the Immigration and Social Security Co\-ordination \(EU Withdrawal\) Bill \[ **5.1vi**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The University of Bristol developed world\-first radar\-based cancer detection system has been commercialised by spin\-out Micrima and is now being sold and being used in hospitals. Current screening technology for breast cancer involves exposure to ionising X\-ray radiation \(itself a potential cause of cancer\) and uncomfortable compression of the breast \- many women choose not to attend their 3 yearly screenings and this very treatable disease tragically remains one of the most common causes of death in women. The University of Bristol approach avoids both ionising radiation and discomfort. 

 Since 2014, Micrima Ltd has received over GBP14 million of investment to commercialise the technology and now employs 25 staff. Having received CE product approval and signed a distribution agreement with multinational Hologic Ltd, its first commercial imaging systems were ordered and shipped to hospitals in mainland Europe in the summer of 2020, where they are now in routine use with patients. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Breast cancer is the most common cause of death in women between the ages of 35 and 49 in the UK**Footnote:**

 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health\-profile\-for\-england/chapter\-2\-major\-causes\-of\-death\-and\-how\-they\-have\-changed 
. National breast screening programmes, using X\-ray mammography, are the front\-line weapon in the fight to improve breast cancer survival statistics. 

 X\-ray equipment is bulky, expensive, and involves potentially harmful ionising X\-ray exposure as well as discomfort for the patient due to the need for compression of the breast. Discomfort is the main reason that only around 70% of women attend their screening appointments. Furthermore, X\-ray also performs poorly in the denser breasts of women under age 40 and hence women under age 50 are not offered routine screening in most countries, including the UK. However, women under 50 accounted for 18% of breast cancer incidences in the UK from 2015 \- 2017 \(the average number of new cases per year was just under 10,000 for this age range\). 

 Bristol’s work on landmine detection, led by Craddock and funded by the Ministry of Defence prompted the team to propose a novel radar\-based breast cancer imaging system as an alternative to X\-ray imaging. With funding from charitable sources and from EPSRC \[i, ii\] the Bristol team, led by Craddock as PI and including Preece, Leendertz, Klemm, Gibbins and Sarafianou, took the technology from theoretical simulation, through lab studies \(Figure 1\) and on to the implementation of a clinical system \(Figure 2\) at the University over the period 2001 to 2010. The team’s expertise in radar signal processing, electromagnetic modelling of complex structures and wideband antenna design led to key breakthroughs included the design of suitable antenna and array structures \[1, 2\] along with focussing algorithms \[3\]. 

 Such radar systems are clutter\-limited rather than signal to noise \(SNR\) limited.  The research challenges included obtaining sufficient bandwidth from an antenna small enough \[1\] to form into an array around the human body, reducing the large skin reflection and other clutter signals through multistatic signal processing \[3\] and being able to perform the necessary signal acquisition within the time period that a patient can lie still for.

 Figure 2: The University’s original clinical prototype under construction in its laboratories 

 The prototype system was comprised of the University’s antenna array and custom\-built switching matrix to connect the antenna elements to a multi\-port vector network analyser \(VNA\) and the baseband signal was processed using the University’s multistatic focussing algorithms \[3\]. 

 The resulting experimental system \(Figure 2\) was initially evaluated using human body “phantoms” \[4\] in which it proved capable of imaging phantom tumours down to 4 mm diameter \(which would be classed as “early stage” cancer\). It then progressed to world\-first clinical trials of such an imaging system \[5\]. 

 In recognition of these achievements, Craddock was awarded the 2005 IEE J. A. Lodge prize for outstanding work in Medical Electronics. The team was subsequently awarded the 1<sup>st</sup> prize and Gold Medal in the ""SET for Britain"" Competition at the House of Commons in 2006 and the Royal Colleges Medal in 2012. 

 In 2005, the University set up spin\-out company, Micrima Ltd, to bring a workable device to market. In addition, subsequent inventive features based on the University’s research have strongly influenced the signal processing algorithms employed in the company’s prototypes \[3\]. In the period 2005 \- 2015 further enhancements in signal processing techniques were pioneered by the University \[6, F, G\] and licensed to Micrima \[A\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Following the success of early research, the University of Bristol set up a spin\-out company, Micrima Ltd in 2005, which licensed the relevant University IP \[F, G\] and took ownership of the experimental hardware and associated software. Within the current REF period the company has brought the concept to market both in the UK and overseas, with the aim of reducing nearly one million deaths each year. 



 Figure 3: Micrima’s MARIA system in use \(with photographic model\) 

 Micrima initially focussed on continuing the existing clinical trials process in order to evidence system performance in a spectrum of patients, to develop its IP portfolio, recruit an engineering team and understand, in collaboration with its suppliers Keysight, how to reduce the production costs of the University’s original experimental system. 

#  Commercialisation of novel technology 

 Regulatory compliance for medical devices is always a major hurdle en route to market and after refinement of the system hardware and software, Micrima commenced the regulatory approval process for its first commercial system MARIA<sup>TM</sup> in 2014 \(shown in Figure 3\), leading to the milestone of European regulatory approval in 2015 \[B\]. As described in \[B\] the system was the first to market worldwide. 

#  Improved cancer detection 

 In 2016, the company published its first trial data \[5\] to evidence system performance in a patient population. 86 imaged breasts yielded a detection rate of 74% which compares well to the 78% score reported in the digital mammographic imaging screening trial \(DMIST\) study \[5\]. In the dense breasts of younger women, MARIA detected 86% of the cancers \- a notable improvement on the DMIST dense breast group performance of 78%. While the sample size is as yet insufficient to draw definitive conclusions, the MARIA results in dense breasts are especially important since women with dense breast tissue have a significantly higher risk of breast cancer. 

 Professor Iain Lyburn, consultant radiologist at Cheltenham General Hospital, stated: *“In the younger patients, who’ve got dense breasts \[…\] the dense breast isn’t a problem, as it were, for the MARIA scan; it treats the breast the same as if it’s a very fatty breast, so potentially we’ll be able to use this in the younger patient for whom we can’t see things with mammograms at all. So in terms of diagnosis, and screening, and family risk patients \[…\] this is one of the areas that’s very exciting.”* \[C\]. The approved MARIA device went into full commercial trials at the Royal Marsden in London, which are ongoing at the time of writing \(the trials were suspended due to Covid\-19\), with 400 women screened to date. 

#  Improved patient wellbeing 

 All feedback from the trials indicate that the scan is much more comfortable for women. In addition, Prof. Lyburn stated that *“Also, as I understand it, people find it quite comfortable. One of the problems with mammography is up to 20% of ladies find it quite uncomfortable. The patients that we’ve had through so far expressed how surprised they are about how comfortable it is, so of course that would increase compliance and tolerance and make it much easier for ladies to have the scan done. …having the patients on board is really helpful.”* \[C\]. One trials patient, who had previously refused X\-ray screening and was interviewed on BBC Breakfast, commented: “Brilliant, painless, safe. It’s like a good meal in a restaurant. I’d go back.” \[A\]. 

 The MARIA device uses low power radio waves at a similar frequency to those commonly used by millions of mobile phones – it is harmless and non\-ionising. Unlike X\-ray therefore, there is no limit to how many times a woman can be imaged. Professor Lyburn emphasizes this *“The thing that’s excellent about it is that potentially it could be used several times on people without any radiation burden.”* \[C\]. 

#  Current status of company 

 Micrima is now an established company with 25 staff in its offices and laboratories in central Bristol, as well as supporting employment within its supply chain \(for example, Keysight \[C\]\). Since 2014, the company has raised GBP10.4 million in equity funding, GBP2 million from a corporate partner and GBP2.6 million in competitively awarded R&D grants. \[A\]. 

 The company has received several awards, including the Frost and Sullivan New Product Innovation award \(December 2018\), Made in the South\-West award \(November 2018\), the Disrupt SW Index award \(September 2018\) and the Medilink SW innovation award \(February 2017\). It was chosen as one of the Top Ten Best Healthcare Start\-ups to watch in 2019 \(July 2019\) \[D\]. 

 
Following a marketing and distribution deal with Hologic Ltd, the first orders were received, and imaging systems shipped to hospitals in the summer of 2020 \[A\].  Following staff training with the team of Professor Uwe Fischer at the Diagnostic Breast Centre in Göttingen \(Figure 4\), the first system is being used with patients there. Delayed slightly by the pandemic, a second system is now in use at the University Medical Center Mainz, with Professor Andrea Teifke \[E\].

 1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) research on Carbon Capture and Storage \(CCS\) and negative emissions \(CO<sub>2</sub> removal from the atmosphere\) underpinned the development of crucial technologies needed to deliver economy\-wide decarbonisation for UK and global industry and established the feasibility of a Net Zero target for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The research, led by Haszeldine, underpinned continued UK engagement in CCS and ultimately the Chancellor’s commitment in the March 2020 UK budget of GPB800,000,000 \(increased in November 2020 to GBP1,000,000,000\), to establish four CCS industry clusters to develop and apply the technology as part of the UK Government’s decarbonisation agenda. Work with the Acorn project, the UK's leading CCS cluster, and their CO2SAPLING Transport Infrastructure Project, led to three cycles of sustained investment \(total to end\-2020 of GBP15,000,000\) by Governments in the UK, Scotland, EU and commercial partners. The group’s expertise in negative emissions, via staff secondment \(Scott\) to the UK Committee on Climate Change, made key inputs to the advice resulting in UK’s world\-leading Net Zero by 2050 climate change legislation, enacted in 2019. 
","
 2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The University of Edinburgh hosts an internationally renowned group on Carbon Capture and Storage \(CCS\), geological storage of CO<sub>2</sub> and Hydrogen, and Negative Emissions, led by Haszeldine.  This group works in the UK and across the world \(Europe, Canada, USA, Australia, South Africa and China\) in support of the development of these crucial technologies to deliver emissions reductions from industry and fuels and enable delivery of Net Zero emissions targets. 

  

 Research by the UoE CCS group has established the huge and strategic capacity of the North Sea subsurface to store CO<sub>2</sub> securely. This enables North Sea oil and gas expertise and engineered infrastructures to transfer into a major global CCS industry. Research assessing Europe\-wide CO<sub>2</sub> storage planning and supporting infrastructures has proven the importance of the UK North Sea for effective Europe\-wide deployment of CCS **\[3.1\]** leading to EU support and investment in project development in the UK and other North Sea countries. Analysis of the potential for a Scottish CCS cluster identifies St Fergus \(Aberdeenshire\) as a key national and European CCS infrastructure hub making advantageous use of existing oil and gas infrastructures to accelerate delivery and reduce costs \(including avoiding substantial decommissioning costs\) **\[3.2\] \[3.3\]** leading to UK and Scotland investment in project design and development. 

 The group has expanded its research into the field of negative emissions, also known as greenhouse gas removals, the direct removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere to enable reaching Net Zero emissions as required to stabilise climate change. In **\[3.4\]** they undertook an important early assessment of the global capability to store CO<sub>2</sub> from negative emissions and developed the distinction between temporary and permanent CO<sub>2</sub> stores. **\[3.5\]** assessed the progress on negative emissions development and its deficit in the context of realising the goals of the United Nations 2015 Paris Agreement treaty on climate change. **\[3.6\]** undertook an early peer\-reviewed analysis of the potential for UK based CO<sub>2</sub> removal by negative emissions technologies and identified feasible approaches to achieving UK Net Zero emissions.

##  Route to Impact 

 *Impact on Policy*. Haszeldine played a pivotal role in advising UK, Scottish and EU governments on CCS and energy and climate policy. He is one of two academics invited onto the Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage \(CCUS\) council, advising the UK Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) Energy Minister \(2016\-present\) **\[5.1\]**. He was the sole academic member of the UK Parliamentary Advisory Group on CCS and co\-author of its report to the Secretary of State for BEIS \(2016\) **\[5.2a\]**. Scott and Haszeldine both worked extensively with policymakers in the EU Commission and the intergovernmental North Sea Basin Task Force, and Scott was seconded in 2018/19 to the UK Committee on Climate Change to provide expert advice on Net Zero to the UK and devolved Governments. Scott also acted as an expert reviewer to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report on 1.5 **°**C \(2018\). 

 *Technical solutions*. The UoE CCS group has provided research support to the St Fergus Acorn project \(https://theacornproject.uk\), the UK's leading CCS cluster, including via their CO2 SAPLING Transport Infrastructure Project described below. Acorn’s aim is to repurpose oil and gas industry expertise and infrastructure in the North\-east of Scotland to the decarbonisation agenda. Haszeldine helped create NECCUS Ltd \- uniquely combining industry actors in collaboration for CCS in Scotland to achieve practical construction and operation by 2024. 

##  Impact on practitioners 

 UK Government industrial strategy **.** The 2016 report to BEIS drew on learning from **\[3.1\]** and **\[3.2\]** to inform key recommendations on strategic investment by UK Government into CCS infrastructure. Specifically, this involves separating investment in CO<sub>2</sub> capture and CO<sub>2</sub> transportation and storage, and setting up clusters of actors sharing infrastructure with the common goal of decarbonising industry, producing low\-carbon hydrogen and enabling negative emissions as a key part of the lowest cost route to achieving the UK’s decarbonisation targets. “ *These features are the basis of all current UK CCS developments \-multiple £Bn, and many others worldwide*” **\[5.2b\]**. 

 The recommendations of the 2016 report to BEIS were “ *adopted in practise by successive civil servants and UK Energy Ministers*” **\[5.2b\]**, culminating in the major commitment to invest in a “ *new CCS Infrastructure Fund of at least £800 million*” to develop CCS clusters and to support the construction of a CCS gas power plant in the March 2020 UK budget **\[5.3a\]**. Announcing this investment, the Chancellor Rishi Sunak said *“Carbon capture and storage is precisely the kind of exciting technology where Britain can lead the world over the next decade. I can announce today that we will invest at least £800 million to establish two or more new carbon capture and storage clusters by 2030…The new clusters will create up to 6,000 high\-skill, high\-wage, low\-carbon jobs in areas like Teesside, Humberside, Merseyside or St Fergus in Scotland*.” **\[5.3b\]**. In November 2020 UK CCS funding was increased to GBP 1,000,000,000 in the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution **\[5.3c\]**. 

 European Union CCS policy and investment *.* Scott and Haszeldine made “ *crucial and valuable contributions in shaping EU CCS policy and securing EU funding for CCS planning and development around the North Sea region*” **\[5.4a\]** by applying their research on North Sea CO<sub>2</sub> storage and CCS projects and infrastructure development **\[3.1\]**.  This resulted in projects in the UK \(see <ins> *UK Industry*</ins> below\), Netherlands, Belgium and Norway being selected as EU Projects of Common Interest eligible for EU Connecting Europe Facilty infrastructure funding \(2017\-2019\). This has resulted in funds awarded in 2020 of EUR102,000,000 towards CO<sub>2</sub> infrastructure construction \(PORTHOS project, Netherlands\), plus EUR5,785,000; EUR 3,187,500 and EUR15,371,781 for engineering design of CO<sub>2</sub> infrastructures and shipping facilities linking Belgium, Netherlands, UK and Norway **\[5.4b\]** and **\[5.4c\]**. 

 Scottish Government CCS policy<ins>.</ins> The Chief Executive of UK Committee on Climate Change and former Director of Energy and Climate for the Scottish Government writes “ *Haszeldine and his team of researchers at Edinburgh University have played a major role in supporting the strategic case for CCS development and deployment in Scotland. Their work on establishing the huge potential of the North Sea’s CO<sub>2</sub> storage resource and the opportunities for the repurposing of oil and gas pipeline infrastructures \(and industry skills\) to enable lower cost deployment* \[of which references **\[3.1\]**\- **\[3.3\]** are examples\] *has informed Scottish policymakers in embracing CCS as a crucial component of Scotland’s climate and energy strategy*.” **\[5.5\]**. 

 UK Industry<ins> *.*</ins> The underpinning research and engagement by Haszeldine and the UoE team supported the development of the St Fergus Acorn CCS project, in particular its CO2Sapling Transport Infrastructure Project \( [https://pale\-blu.com/co2\-sapling](https://pale-blu.com/co2-sapling)\). Acorn CCS is the UK’s most advanced CCS technology cluster, underpinning delivery of UK and European industry decarbonisation and low carbon hydrogen fuel **\[5.6a\]**. Acorn CCS is led by Pale Blue Dot Energy, with funding and support from industry partners Chrysaor, Shell and Total, the UK and Scottish Governments, and the European Union. It is strategically located in the North East of Scotland to repurpose legacy oil and gas pipeline and wells to CO<sub>2</sub> storage, rather than undertake costly decommissioning, as recommended by **\[3.3\]**. This ‘upcycling’ or infrastructure reuse enables rapid and cost\-effective project delivery saving up to GBP750,000,000 compared with commissioning new pipelines and boreholes. In 2018, Acorn’s CO2Sapling project was awarded funding by the EU as a Project of Common Interest \(EUR374,000\) **\[5.6b\]** with co\-funding from the UK \(GBP175,000\) and Scotland \(GBP175,000\) **\[5.6c\]**. In 2019 Acorn was awarded a further EUR 2,800,000 from the EU **\[5.6b\]**, GBP4,8000,000 from UK BEIS CCUS Innovation Programme **\[5.6d\]**, and in 2020 GBP2,700,000 from UK BEIS Hydrogen supply competition **\[5.6e\]**. Together these initiatives represent a sustained investment of GBP15,000,000 by Governments in the UK, Scotland, and EU alongside commercial partners. 

 Integrated action by Government, Industry, and Research practitioners. In November 2019, building out from the Acorn project, Haszeldine and SCCS helped establish the North East Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage \( [www.neccus.co.uk](http://www.neccus.co.uk/)\) alliance of 33 industries \(including Shell, Total, Ineos, SSE, Doosan Babcock\), government agencies and research institutions as the delivery vehicle for CCS on UK industry, funded by GBP300,000 from the Scottish Government **\[5.6a\].** In April 2019 NECCUS was awarded GBP100,000 to prepare bids to the UK Government’s Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund **\[5.6f\]**. 

 UK Central and Devolved Government climate change legislation.  Scott led the assessment of negative emissions potential for the UK Committee on Climate Change \(CCC\) 2019 which provided formal advice on Net Zero emissions to the UK, Scotland and Wales Governments **\[5.7a\]**. Informed by UoE work on negative emissions \(including **\[3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]\)** Scott’s “ *work made a key contribution to the CCC’s Net Zero advice*” **\[5.5\]** which was subsequently adopted by UK and Scottish governments passing legislation in 2019 updating their Climate Change Act targets to Net Zero by 2050 **\[5.7b\]** and Net Zero by 2045 respectively **\[5.7c\]**. The UK Budget 2020 states “ *the transition to a net\-zero economy by 2050 will require radical changes in every sector”* and presents a range of measures to advance Net Zero action including to “ *at least double the size of the energy innovation programme*” and “ *an additional £10 million in 2020\-21 to support the design and delivery of net zero policies and programmes*” **\[5.3a\]**. Furthermore, “ *Vivian* \[Scott’s\] *work helped identify the importance of Direct Air Capture \(DAC\) technologies \- machines that scrub CO<sub>2</sub> from the air \- as a permanent and potentially rapidly scalable GGR* \[Greenhouse Gas Removal – alternative term for negative emissions\] *approach. This led to the inclusion of a strategic cost discovery scale of DAC deployment in our* \[CCC\] *UK Net Zero emissions pathway*.” **\[5.5\]**. This has been taken up by UK government with the announcement in June 2020 of “ *up to £100 million*” of funding for Direct Air Capture R&D **\[5.7d\]**, and in Dec 2020 by a further GBP180,000,000 of funding for Hydrogen, CCS and Negative Emissions Technologies announced by Scottish Government **\[5.7e\]**. 

 UN and international climate action<ins>.</ins>  The group’s research outputs, including **\[3.5\]** were cited in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report \(IPCC\) on 1.5 **°**C \(2018\) **\[5.8a\]**. The findings of the 2018 IPCC 1.5 **°**C Report which provide scientific assessment of the actions required to achieve the UN Paris Agreement, underpins the subsequent strengthening of climate change targets worldwide with many major economies \(together around 70% of the world’s economy\) following the UK in setting Net Zero emissions targets in 2019 **\[5.8b\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Southampton’s Environmental Healthcare Unit, within the School of Biological Sciences, has proved the antimicrobial properties of copper alloys by demonstrating their ability to kill a range of harmful pathogens including MRSA and SARS\-CoV2. These findings have led to major clinical trials and influence in public health bodies, leading to the installation of antimicrobial copper touch surfaces globally in hospitals, in supermarkets, on public transport and in the world’s busiest airport. This research has informed retail strategy, shaped government infection control policy and influenced new international standards that have enabled the commercialisation of products with an antimicrobial claim, resulting in the certification of more than 450 copper\-containing antimicrobial products on the market. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Recognised for its antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties, copper has a rich history of being exploited for health purposes. Its first recorded medical use can be found in Egyptian books written between 2600 and 2200 BC, which describe the use of copper in sterilising chest wounds and drinking water. It was used to treat skin infections in ancient Greece, cure ailments in ancient China and India, and remains an important component of traditional medicine today. 

 Research led by Professor Bill Keevil has described the processes through which copper, and its alloys, exhibit their anti\-microbial properties, and has demonstrated the metal’s efficacy in killing superbugs, viruses and fungal pathogens, especially within clinical environments. Studies began in 2002 through a collaboration with the New York\-based Copper Development Association \(CDA\) \[ **G1**\], looking, for the first time, at whether common copper alloys could kill foodborne pathogens. The research showed that copper alloys killed *Escherichia coli O157* \( *E. coli*\) \[ **3.1**\] and *Listeria monocytogenes*, thus highlighting the potential of copper surfaces, as an alternative to stainless steel, when addressing risks of cross\-contamination during food preparation. 

 In 2006, the CDA switched the focus of its funding to researching the efficacy of copper surfaces in reducing rates of healthcare\-associated infections \(HAIs\) amid growing awareness of the scale of the threat posed by HAIs to patient safety. Around that time, HAIs were responsible for infections in 1.7 million people, 98,987 deaths and USD35.7bn\-45bn in treatment costs each year in the US alone, according to government figures. Studies supervised by Keevil at Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham demonstrated that copper alloys kill antibiotic\-resistant ‘superbugs’ methicillin\-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* \(MRSA\), vancomycin\-resistant enterococci \(VRE\) and *Clostridium difficile*. For example, studies showed that two strains of VRE were killed in less than 1 hour on alloys containing 90 per cent copper and *C. difficile* spores died in 24\-48 hours when exposed to copper alloys \[ **3.2**\]. 

 In parallel, the CDA started working with the International Copper Association \(ICA\) in 2005, to obtain official registration of copper alloys as an antimicrobial material with the US Environmental Protection Agency \(EPA\). Keevil’s findings paved the way for the successful development of an EPA\-approved antimicrobial surface test assay, for which Keevil provided guidance based on University of Southampton laboratory methods. In 2008 the EPA certified the Cu\+ trademark underpinned by these methods. This was a first for a solid material. Since then the trademark has been awarded to 450\-plus copper alloys with an antimicrobial touch surface efficacy claim \[ **5.6**\]. 

 During 2012, Keevil and colleagues demonstrated the mechanisms that occur when pathogens land on copper surfaces due to touch, coughs or sneezes. To do this, they developed a ‘wet’ inoculum challenge assay to simulate cough and sneeze droplets falling onto surfaces, and a ‘dry’ challenge assay to facilitate rapid drying of a pathogen inoculum onto a surface to simulate hand contact \[ **3.3**\]. These studies showed that copper ions, released from copper surfaces, rapidly inhibit cell respiration, attack the bacterial cell membrane or disrupt the viral coat, and destroy the DNA and RNA inside. This means that no mutation can occur, preventing the microbe from developing resistance to copper \[ **3.4**\]. This disproved research by other groups, who claimed copper does not affect DNA and RNA integrity. Keevil’s group showed that transfer of antibiotic resistance genes from resistant bacteria to other bacteria is stopped because the nucleic acids encoding these genes are destroyed \[ **3.5**\]. These destructive properties are enhanced by bacterial metabolism, which generates small amounts of hydrogen peroxide. This reacts with the copper ions to form reactive oxygen, which damages the microbes in multiple areas \[ **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Background: Translation of research findings into clinical trials** 

 Keevil’s early research showing the effectiveness of copper in killing *E. coli*, *Listeria* and superbugs formed the basis of two influential clinical trials led by the Copper Development Association \(CDA\) in the UK and US: 

 The UK trial \(2010\) \[ **5.1**\] was funded by the CDA and based in Selly Oak Hospital – the site of Keevil’s studies into superbugs. Keevil was an advisor to the trial and four of his studies were cited as key evidence. The trial reported a 90% reduction in bacterial loading on copper\-plated surfaces. 

 For the US trial \(2013\) \[ **5.2**\] the CDA obtained funding from the Department of Defense, crediting Keevil’s studies in giving them the confidence to undertake a major trial involving three hospitals \[ **5.3**\]. The trial demonstrated a reduction in infection rates of 58% in intensive care units which incorporated copper plating onto the surfaces of six frequently\-touched near\-patient objects. 

 Harold Michels, the Vice President of the CDA, stated: “ *Professor Keevil’s research has not only stimulated others to conduct laboratory research on the antimicrobial properties of copper, but also served as a foundation to those conducting clinical trials. The net result is that he has proven that copper alloys kill numerous microorganisms that cause hospital\-acquired infections… Professor Keevil has persistently and enthusiastically advocated for reducing and preventing hospital acquired infections and thus saving lives by the use of copper.”* \[ **5.3**\] 

 **Installation of antimicrobial copper surfaces in hospitals and other healthcare settings** 

 The list below is a snapshot of the nature and extent of global clinical impact of antimicrobial copper surfaces since 2014, as reported by the CDA, following Keevil’s studies and the subsequent trials \[ **5.4**\]: 

-  Kitasato University Hospital, a newly remodelled, 1,000\-bed hospital in Japan, installed antimicrobial copper door furniture throughout its internal medicine, dermatology, pharmaceutical, haematology and outpatient facilities, while Hitachi Medical Center in Tokyo installed antimicrobial copper beds and overbed tables in its convalescent wards. These were two of nine Japanese hospitals to incorporate antimicrobial copper into their wards in 2014, according to Australian news source ‘Hospital and Healthcare’. 

-  The Sir Robert Ogden Macmillan Centre, a cancer support and information centre that was opened in 2015, and based at Harrogate, installed antimicrobial copper touch surfaces throughout their facility to maximise patient safety. 

-  The 774\-bed Hamburg Asklepios Clinic, a large hospital in Germany that treats 76,000 residents per year, installed antimicrobial copper as part of a refurbishment in 2015. 

-  Santiago Public Emergency Hospital, a leading Chilean hospital, in 2015 installed antimicrobial copper bed rails and handles, and replaced door handles, sinks and taps and overbed tables with antimicrobial copper equivalents. This followed a clinical trial in nearby Valparaíso, which cited Keevil’s studies. 

-  South Africa’s ‘Miracle Trains’ – Transnet’s Phelophepa I and II – provide mobile healthcare to more than 300,000 people in remote rural communities annually. In 2015 the 18\-coach trains were equipped with antimicrobial copper door handles and cupboard doors. 

-  Grinnell Regional Medical Center, the largest hospital in Iowa serving 40,000 residents, took the decision in 2016 to install antimicrobial copper hardware and components throughout its facility. 

 Overall, in the two years after the 2013 trial, the CDA recorded 60 hospitals in 20 countries in Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia that had installed antimicrobial copper surfaces and furniture. Installations had predominantly taken place in clinical settings where patients are at high risk for infections, such as ICU rooms, paediatric and neonatal units, and cancer centres. \[ **5.5**\]. 

 In terms of the economic significance, drawing upon the 2013 trial, a health economics assessment by the University of York \[ **5.6**\] found that the cost of replacing the six near\-patient objects in a 20\-bed intensive care unit can be recouped in less than two months. This translates to a 5\-year saving of almost GBP2,000,000 if antimicrobial copper surfaces are fitted during a planned build or refurbishment. 

 **Installation of antimicrobial copper surfaces in public venues, transport infrastructure and commercial settings** 

 Keevil’s demonstration of the benefits of antimicrobial copper has led to its use in public settings and transportation. The CDA reported the installation in 2014 of antimicrobial copper drinking fountains in the world’s busiest airport, Atlanta \(107m passengers in 2018\) and antimicrobial copper handrails on Poland’s *Solis Urbino* bus \(European Bus of the Year, 2017\). \[ **5.7**\] 

 Keevil has a longstanding association with electroplating firm Necon Technologies Ltd, who learned of his research while investigating legionella control through copper silver ionisation. Necon’s copper touch surface business, *Copper Cover*, has relied on Bill’s validation of their products to bring them to market, including a 2020 test for SARS\-CoV2. The pandemic has seen the company coat more than 10,000 commonly touched surfaces in locations such as care homes, hospitals and schools. \[ **5.8**\] 

 Later in 2020, the UK Department for International Trade \(DIT\) introduced Keevil to the UK supermarket chain Morrisons, who resultantly commissioned Copper Cover to trial the installation of copper touch surfaces in its staff rooms. Currently 1 in 5 infections are transmitted in supermarkets, and Morrisons serve 12 million customers each week across 494 stores throughout the UK \[ **5.9**\]. The trial has led Morrisons to consider the permanent installation of antimicrobial copper surfaces on common touch points such as door push plates and trolley handles: 



 **Informing government infection control policies in Europe and shaping new international regulatory standards for commercial products with antimicrobial claims** 

 Following the approval of copper as an antimicrobial material by the US Environmental Protection Agency \(EPA\), which was based on Keevil’s research, Poland’s National Centre for Quality Assessment in Healthcare \(NCQA\) revised its accreditation standards for healthcare facilities. This included in 2017, Europe’s first official recommendation to incorporate antimicrobial copper touch surfaces as an infection prevention and control measure \[ **5.10**\]. The new accreditation standards provide guidelines concerning the prevention of pathogen transmission by touch. Chapter IX ‘Infection Control’ states: “ *Reduction of microbial transmission should be achieved, inter alia, using frequently\-touched surfaces made from metals with antimicrobial properties, such as copper, brass and bronze, as per the US Environmental Protection Agency’s registration*.” 

 Lubin Hospital, in South West Poland, subsequently installed copper alloy surfaces in its new operating theatres. In recognition of his contribution, Keevil was invited as the Special Guest at the ‘Safe Hospital for the Future’ Gala awards event in Warsaw, where he gave the keynote lecture on ‘Breaking the Chain of Infection’. The event was attended by senior members of the Polish medical community, including the Polish Deputy Minister of Health and the Director of the World Health Organization \(WHO\) Office in Poland \[ **5.7**\]. 

 In 2014, Keevil was an invited speaker at a meeting in the French National Assembly in Paris attended by French MPs, WHO officials and the French Patients Association \(Le Ligne\). At this meeting the introduction of antimicrobial copper alloy surfaces to reduce HAIs in French hospitals was discussed. This led to further successful trials of copper alloy fittings in long\-term care facilities in 2018, supported by regional French government and the European Commission, and the decision to draw up a French standard, equivalent to the EPA standard in the US. France’s equivalent AFNOR \(Standards Commission S95S, N36\) adopted the dry method testing method developed at Southampton \[ **3.1**\] to evaluate copper alloy and non\-copper products with an antimicrobial surface claim for commercialisation. Keevil attended several AFNOR meetings, following on from the original French National Assembly event, and contributed expert advice based on his research. The new AFNOR standard \(NF S90\-700\) was published in April 2019 and since led to the successful establishment of a new technical committee on *Surfaces with biocidal and antimicrobial Properties* at the International Organization of Standardization \(ISO\) in June 2020 \[ **5.11**\]. The wet and dry testing methods developed at Southampton \[ **3.1**\] have been translated into standard CEN/ISO test methods by the British Standards Institute \[ **5.12**\]. 

 **Commercial impact arising from the government\-approved certification of the Cu\+ trademark for antimicrobial copper products** 

 Keevil’s work has influenced the development of test standards, which the CDA states are *“essential  for  international  competitiveness  of  companies  selling antimicrobial  materials  such as  copper  alloys’’* \[ **5.7**\]. The new international standards, which regulate the commercialisation of products with an antimicrobial touch surface claim, have resulted in the certification of more than 450 copper\-containing antimicrobial products on the market \[ **5.7**\]. This includes a specific product line “KME Plus®” from KME, one of the world’s largest manufacturer of copper and copper alloy products. The company increased their revenue from USD1,440,000 in 2014 to USD1,980,000 in 2019, and directly refer to Keevil’s work in their official KME Plus® information brochure \[ **5.13**\]. 

 **Health and commercial impact through copper\-infused clothing** 

 *Copper Clothing* *Ltd* was set up in December 2012 after the founder saw a demonstration by Keevil online showing the speed at which MRSA dies on copper compared to stainless steel. Keevil was commissioned by the company in 2014 to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of copper\-impregnated fabrics, in products including bed sheets, pyjamas and socks. This paved the way for further R&D activities in the NHS and direct employment of a doctor at the company. Additionally, research led by Keevil has underpinned developments of their copper\-impregnated facemask, with over 250,000 units now sold \[ **5.14**\]. 

 **Increasing public awareness of the benefits of antimicrobial copper** 

 Keevil’s advocacy of the benefits of antimicrobial copper have gone far beyond his numerous peer\-reviewed papers and presentations at high\-profile conferences. His proactive engagement with the international media has resulted in widespread coverage. In the UK this includes BBC News channels, the BBC’s One Show and Dara Ó Briain’s Science Club \(19,732 views\) while coverage abroad includes Le Figaro and Times of India. It was featured in 35 news stories from 34 outlets and reached an upper bound of two million followers on Twitter. A 2017 article by Keevil in The Conversation, which brought together all Southampton research in this area, reached an audience of 234,210 and was tweeted 487 times and shared on Facebook 14,700 times. Keevil’s 2020 Smithsonian Magazine article on ‘coppers virus killing powers’ was shared over 6,000 times on social media. Over the impact period, coverage of Keevil’s combined research reached an estimated hundreds of millions of people, measured by examples of media coverage provided by the CDA \[ **5.7**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The automated image analysis techniques developed at Imperial College are now widely used for the quantitative interpretation of brain Magnetic Resonance \(MR\) images as part of clinical trials advancing the development of new drugs and in improving healthcare diagnostics for neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Huntingdon’s and Parkinson’s. This case study describes the resulting key impacts including: 

1.  the further development of a spin\-off company, IXICO, co\-founded by researchers from Imperial College, including its admission on AIM and its growth from 36 to 78 employees; 

1.  the use of automated image analysis techniques and imaging biomarkers in more than 2,000 imaging centres \(increased from 400\) in 50\+ countries; 

1.  the increase in analysis from 10,000 to over 100,000 brain MR images in clinical trials using the developed image analysis techniques.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research has been carried out in the Biomedical Image Analysis \(BioMedIA\) Group at Imperial College between 2000 and 2012. 

 Much of the early work of the group has addressed one of the fundamental problems in computer vision and medical image computing, namely the problem of image registration. The goal of image registration is to find an automatic transformation between points in two or more images. For the transformation to be meaningful, it must map corresponding points across coordinate systems. If the transformation sought is rigid, the problem is relatively straightforward to solve, as the number of unknowns is small \(typically 3 in 2D and 6 in 3D\). In contrast, if the required transformation is non\-rigid, the problem becomes substantially more challenging because the degree of freedom is much higher \(typically in the order of hundreds of thousands, or even millions\). In practical medical and clinical applications, non\-rigid registration, however, is crucial to compensate for intra\-subject variation \(e.g., tissue deformation, respiratory or cardiac motion\) as well as for inter\-subject variation. 

 In 2001, Rueckert and his colleagues developed a solution to this problem that is based on a flexible and versatile deformation model using B\-spline free\-form deformations \[R1\]. This approach is capable of registering mono\-modal and multi\-modal images, and it was the first to adopt the use of adaptive, hierarchical B\-spline free\-form deformations that offer the ability to deal with complex deformations. This developed solution has been widely adopted: in a recent comparison study, it has been shown to be amongst the most accurate solutions for this problem \[R2\]. In 2006, Rueckert’s group proposed an improved solution to the registration problem that uses a diffeomorphic deformation to allow the modelling of very large deformations, which occur when registering the images of different subjects \[R3\]. 

 The ability of these image registration techniques to handle very large deformations has also led Rueckert’s group to develop novel solutions to the classical problem of image segmentation, which is based on image registration. As part of the EPSRC\-funded IXI \[i\] and IBIM \[ii\] projects, they have pioneered the use of non\-rigid registration of multiple atlases followed by vote or label fusion for the automatic segmentation of images \[R4\]. Standard atlas\-based segmentation uses image registration to transfer anatomical information from an atlas to new, unseen images. In contrast to this, multi\-atlas segmentation \[R4\] uses multiple atlases and registrations followed by machine learning approaches, such as decision fusion, to provide a consensus estimate of the segmentation. This approach provides a much more robust and accurate segmentation of medical images. It has become the de\-facto standard solution for medical image segmentation in many applications \(as shown by the large number of citations\), in particular for neurological, abdominal, and cardiac images. The name of the research project in \[i\] \(“IXI”\) has inspired the name of the resulting spin\-off company \(“IXICO” – see Section 4 for details\). 

 In the EU FP7 PredictAD project \[iii\], the team further developed the methodology described above to enable the robust and accurate extraction of imaging biomarkers, in particular in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia. For example, this methodology allows the accurate measurement of hippocampal volume \[R5\] and volume loss \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The underpinning research has led to the development of novel imaging biomarkers that are now routinely used in clinical trials to assess the efficacy of new drugs and treatments. The biomarkers are also used in healthcare diagnostics, e.g., for dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease \(AD\). 

 **Economic impact** 

 To maximise the economic impact of the research, a team of Imperial researchers \(Rueckert, Hajnal\) started IXICO with colleagues from UCL \(Hawkes, Hill\) in late 2004. In the assessment period for the 2014 REF, IXICO had been established and grown organically. In the current REF assessment period, several new key impacts occurred: in particular, in  [October 2013, it became IXICO plc ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IXICO)and is now listed on the  [Alternative Investment Market \(AIM\) of the London Stock Exchange ](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/stock/IXI/ixico-plc/company-page?lang=en)\(date: 15th October 2013\). Other impact measures are listed in the table below and compared to the status at the beginning of the assessment period: 

| **Key impact metrics** | **2012/13** | **2020** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Turnover | GBP2,500,000 | GBP9,500,000 |
| Employees | 36 | 78 |
| Imaging centres | 400 | 2,000\+ |
| Images analysed | 10,000 | 100,000\+ |
| Safety and eligibility reports | n/a | 20,000\+ |

 Since the start of the assessment period, IXICO has grown from 36 to 78 employees. IXICO’s revenues have increased from GBP2,500,000 to more than GBP9,500,000. IXICO has become a profitable business and, since 2014, has won more than GBP36,200,000 in business from the global pharmaceutical industry \(GSK, Pfizer, Bristol\-Myers Squibb, Novartis, Eli Lily\). Its orderbook for 2020 is GBP21,700,000 alone. IXICO’s image analysis technology is based on the underpinning research described in Section 2 and has been transferred from Imperial during IXICO’s formation and later as part of an IP pipeline agreement with Imperial. It has been, and/or is currently being used to analyse tens of thousands of medical images collected from a total of more than 2,000 imaging centres across North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Australasia \(in over 50 countries\) \[I1, I2, I3\]. Since 2013, IXICO has been involved in over 50 clinical trials and analysed brain images from more than 100,000 subject visits using its image analysis technology \[I2\]. 

 Originally, IXICO had focused on applying its image analysis technology to supporting clinical trials of novel therapies to treat Alzheimer’s disease. Since the beginning of the REF assessment period, IXICO has successfully translated the technology to other neurological diseases, including Huntington’s disease, Parkinsonian diseases \(such as PD, PSP and MSA\), Multiple Sclerosis and rare neurological diseases. In particular, IXICO has had much success in the Huntington’s disease \(HD\) clinical trials market, having built the requisite therapeutic expertise and validated the technology specifically for measuring imaging biomarkers that are correlated with disease pathology and progression in HD. Since 2014, IXICO has been selected for 10 clinical trials in HD, 7 of which were started over the past 4 years since 2016 and includes the world’s first phase III trial in Huntington’s disease for a gene therapy approach that targets the mutant Huntington gene \[I1\]. 

 The developed image analysis techniques also provide an important tool in clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs as well as for enrichment of clinical trials, i.e., as inclusion/exclusion criteria. This enrichment of trials enables the reduction of heterogeneity of the population providing additional power for clinical trials, therefore increasing the sensitivity of trials to detect disease\-modifying effects of drugs. Since 2013, IXICO has used the automated image analysis techniques for safety and eligibility reports in over 20,000 cases \[I2\]. 

 **Impact on public policy and services** 

 The techniques for automatically computing imaging biomarkers such as low hippocampal volume have had a significant impact on informing the development of new guidelines in regulatory clinical trials. This has been recognised, e.g., by the Coalition Against Major Diseases \(CAMD\) consortium by submitting to regulators an application to qualify low hippocampal volume as a biomarker \[I4, I5\]. This submission – supported by the US Federal Drug Administration – incorporates key data obtained using the underpinning research described here: the availability of this technology, with the regulatory qualification, is having a global impact on the design of future trials of AD medicines in the pre\-dementia population. Furthermore, IXICO is also part of key public/private partnerships that are advancing the scientific and regulatory agenda for clinical trials in neurological diseases. These include: 

-  EPAD \(the European Prevention of Alzheimer’s Dementia;  [http://ep\-ad.org](http://ep-ad.org/)\) – which has built an adaptive clinical trials platform with a readiness cohort of people at risk of Alzheimer’s disease and which will enable pharma companies to evaluate efficiently the safety and effectiveness of their medicines in patients prior to onset of symptoms by utilising adaptive clinical trial approaches. IXICO received over EUR600,000 in grant funding to provide the technology to collect, manage and analyse MRI scans. 

-  AMYPAD \(Amyloid Imaging for Prevention of Alzheimer’s Dementia,  [https://amypad.eu](https://amypad.eu/)\) – which is evaluating the diagnostic value of amyloid imaging in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. IXICO received over EUR1,000,000 in grant funding to provide the technology to collect, manage and analyse MRI and PET scans. 

-  HD\-RSC \(Huntington’s Disease Regulatory Science Consortium,  [https://c\-path.org/programs/hdrsc/](https://c-path.org/programs/hdrsc/)\) – which is developing regulatory\-endorsed drug development tools to support the development and approval of new medicines to treat HD and involves representatives from the FDA. IXICO is contributing to the regulatory clearance of imaging biomarkers. 

-  CPP \(Critical Path for Parkinson’s,  [https://c\-path.org/programs/cpp/](https://c-path.org/programs/cpp/)\) – which is developing regulatory\-endorsed drug development tools to support the development and approval of new medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease and involves representatives from the FDA. IXICO is contributing to the development of a regulatory\-endorsed digital outcome measure for Parkinson’s disease. 

 **Beneficiaries of the impact** 

 The beneficiaries are pharmaceutical companies developing new drugs and therapies for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Huntington’s disease through improved efficacy and safety of clinical trials. Furthermore, patients are benefitting from improved imaging\-based diagnostics and therapeutics. 

 **Nature of the impact** 

 IXICO’s image analysis techniques provide an important tool in clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs as well as for enrichment of trials, enabling the reduction of heterogeneity of the population. The image analysis techniques provide increased sensitivity to detect disease\-modifying effects of drugs and trials. This means that fewer patients need to be recruited into trials, leading to significant cost savings for pharma companies. IXICO has also supported clinical trials of novel therapies relating to neurological diseases and contributed to new guidelines for biomarkers in regulated clinical trials.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Gambian Human African trypanosomiasis \(g\-HAT\), commonly called sleeping sickness, is a fatal disease caused by trypanosomes transmitted by tsetse flies. 

 World Health Organization \(WHO\) leads a global programme to eliminate g\-HAT as a public health problem by 2020. International research led by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine \(LSTM\) produced ‘Tiny Targets’, a simple method of tsetse control. By 2020, Tiny Targets protected approximately 1,800,000 people in the 5 countries where most \(90%\) cases of g\-HAT occur. Vector control has contributed to WHO achieving its goal of reducing the number of cases of gHAT reported globally to less than 2,000 cases/year by 2020; between 2017 and 2019, the number of new cases reported annually ranged between 1,409 and 864 compared to 10,466 and 2,110 for the previous decade \(between 2007 and 2016\).

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Most \(more than 95%\) cases of Human African Trypanosomiasis \(HAT\) occur in Central and West Africa and are caused by *Trypanosoma* *brucei gambiense* \(Gambian HAT, g\-HAT\) transmitted by riverine species of tsetse. There are no vaccines or prophylactic drugs effective against g\-HAT and disease management has relied almost exclusively on case detection and treatment. Achieving high coverage \(more than 70% cases detected\) of the population is difficult in the remote settings where g\-HAT occurs. Between 30% and 90% of cases are never detected, and without treatment, patients inevitably die. In addition, the standard treatment for advanced \(second\-stage\) disease, nifurtimox\-eflornithine combination therapy \(NECT\), is complex to administer \(e.g. 14 intravenous infusions over a fortnight\) in the remote settings where g\-HAT commonly occurs. Vector control offers the only means of protecting people from infection, but the standard methods of control were not cost\-effective for the vectors of *T. b. gambiense*. Accordingly, Lehane initiated an international programme to develop new, low\-cost methods of tsetse control, as part of a global effort, led by WHO, to eliminate g\-HAT as a public health problem by 2020 and achieve complete interruption of transmission by 2030. 

 Six academic staff from LSTM led a multinational team of vector biologists \(LSTM, University of Greenwich, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement \(IRD\), France\) and chemical ecologists \(Rothamsted Research\). The team worked in partnership with scientists from some of the most affected countries \(Burkina Faso \(Centre international de recherche\-développement sur l'elevage en zone subhumide \(CIRDES\)\), Cote d’Ivoire \(Institut Pierre Richer\(IPR\)\), Kenya \(International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology \(ICIPE\)\) and Democratic Republic of Congo \(Labovet\)\), to develop cost\-effective methods of controlling tsetse vectors of pathogenic trypanosomes in sub\-Saharan Africa. We first carried out field\-based analyses of the behavioural responses of riverine tsetse to the visual and olfactory cues produced by hosts \(between 2007 and 2011\). LSTM led the research programme \(PI= Lehane\) and LSTM vector biologists worked in Africa with national researchers from each country. 

 Our work led to the discovery that riverine tsetse are highly responsive to small \(25cm<sup>2</sup>\) blue\-coloured targets. These initial findings applied to all the most important vectors of *T. b. gambiense* \[1\], suggesting that deploying small insecticide\-treated targets in the riverine habitats where tsetse concentrate could provide a cost\-effective means of vector control. Working with an industrial partner \(Vestergaard\), we developed ‘Tiny Targets’, small \(25cm x 25cm\) panels of blue polyester flanked by a panel of insecticide\-impregnated netting. Results from field trials of Tiny Targets conducted in Kenya, Uganda and Guinea between 2012 and 2015 showed that the targets dramatically reduced densities of tsetse by 70% to more than 90% \[2,3,4\], and the incidence of g\-HAT by more than 90% \[3, 4\]  For example, in the Mandoul focus of Chad, Tiny Targets were estimated to have contributed 70.4% \(95% CI: 51–95%\) of the reduction in reported cases between 2014 \(90 cases\) and 2015 \(47 cases\) \[4\]. Economic analyses of the trials conducted in Uganda \[5\] and Chad \[6\] showed that the cost of tsetse control was reduced to less than USD100/km<sup>2</sup>, representing a more than 80% reduction in costs compared to standard methods of tsetse control. More than 80% of g\-HAT cases occur in Democratic Republic of Congo \(DRC\), and epidemiological models of g\-HAT in high\-endemicity foci suggested that the existing strategy of detecting and treating cases only would delay achieving the 2030 goal by 91\- 206 years \(2121 and 2236\) compared to the year 2024 if Tiny Targets were also used \[7\]. The development of a cost\-effective and logistically simple method of tsetse control led to a shift in the strategies of national programmes and the WHO for eliminating g\-HAT, with vector control becoming a named tool that should be combined with case detection and treatment.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Tiny Targets protected approximately 1,800,000 people in the 5 countries where 89.6% \(34653 of the total 38668 cases\) of all g\-HAT cases were reported in the last decade \(between 2010 and 2019\) \[1\]. Evidence of the impact of Tiny Targets on g\-HAT across a range of epidemiological settings led to tsetse control being included in national and global strategies to eliminate g\-HAT as a public health problem. 

 **Impact on populations at risk of g\-HAT** 

 Following successful trials conducted between 2011 and 2013 \(reference 3 & 4 in Section 3\), use of Tiny Targets was scaled up in in Uganda and Guinea to cover all g\-HAT foci by 2020. Tiny Targets were also adopted by national HAT control programmes in Chad \(2014\), DRC \(2015\) and Côte d’Ivoire \(2016\). The largest deployment was in DRC where the Tryp\-Elim programme, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \(BMGF\) supported the annual deployment of 43,000 Tiny Targets and by 2019 approximately 300,000 people across 5,300km<sup>2</sup> were protected from g\-HAT. A second BMGF\-funded programme \(“Trypa\-NO\!”\) has supported the scale\-up of Tiny Targets in additional countries and, since 2017, a total of approximately 1,500,000 people have been protected in Guinea \(1,900km<sup>2</sup>, 200,000 people protected\), Chad \(960km<sup>2</sup>, 80,000 people\), Uganda \(3,900km<sup>2</sup>, 1,139,000 people\) and Ivory Coast \(250km<sup>2</sup>, 170,000 people\) \[2\]. 

 The scale\-up of Tiny Targets has had a dramatic impact on disease incidence. In addition to our own data from Chad \(reference 4 in Section 2\), others have shown that targets reduced the annual incidence of g\-HAT in the Boffa focus in Guinea by over 90% \(14/1279=1.09% without vector control *vs* 2/2777=0.07% with vector control\) \[3\]. Continued deployment of Tiny Targets in the Mandoul and Maro foci of Chad has contributed to a decrease from 95 \(2014\) to 16 \(2019\) in the total number of cases reported nationally. The development of a tsetse control method that is affordable and practicable for local communities \(Tiny Targets can be distributed using bikes and dugout canoes rather than lorries\) has strengthened the resilience of control programmes. In Guinea, the Ebola crisis interrupted programmes to screen\-and\-treat populations for g\-HAT and in the Boffa focus, prevalence of g\-HAT increased in areas where Tiny Targets were absent but remained low in areas where the local community deployed Tiny Targets \[3\]. Similarly, deployment of Tiny Targets continued in all countries during the Covid\-19 pandemic. 

 **Impact on national g\-HAT strategies** 

 Economic \[4\] and epidemiological models \[5\] indicated that the addition of tsetse control using Tiny Targets to the standard screen\-and\-treat strategies accelerates progress towards the WHO elimination goals. For instance, analyses of progress towards elimination goals in DRC suggested that 37 of 43 Health Zones in DRC health zones will require vector control to meet the 2030 elimination goal \[5\]. Since starting with a pilot project in 2015, deploying Tiny Targets in Yasa Bonga Health Zone, which demonstrated >85% reduction in tsetse numbers \[6\], activities have now expanded to six further Health Zones \(Masi Manimba, Kikongo, Bandundu, Kwamouth, Bulungu and Bolobo\) as part of the national strategy to meet the 2030 elimination goal. Theoretical and empirical evidence of the impact of Tiny Targets led the national programmes of Chad \(PNLTHA\), Cote d’Ivoire \(IPR\), DRC \(PNLTHA\), Guinea \(PNLTHA\) and Uganda \(COCTU\) to adopt Tiny Targets as part of their national strategies to control g\-HAT. Consequently, use of Tiny Targets has increased from 10,000 deployed in 2013 to 100,000 deployed annually in 2020. Over the same period, the aggregate area over which Tiny Targets were deployed increased from approximately 750km<sup>2</sup> to 13,000km<sup>2</sup> to protect approximately 1,800,000 people. Recognising its philanthropic and ethical responsibilities, Vestergaard, the manufacturer of Tiny Targets, announced that they will donate all Tiny Targets free from 2020 onwards \[7\]. 

 **Global policy** 

 Our empirical and theoretical evidence combined with outreach and engagement activities with normative bodies led to a 2014 WHO recommendation that tsetse control should be an integral part of the global programme to eliminate g\-HAT \[8\]. Policy makers were engaged through regular visits by LSTM researchers to the headquarters of WHO \(Geneva\), African Union \(Addis Ababa\) and national ministries of health, as well as presentations at international meetings organised by WHO \[7\], the AU’s Pan\-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign \(PATTEC\) and International Scientific Council for Trypanosomiasis Research and Control \(ISCTRC\), meetings with the leaders of national programmes \[9\] and engagement with print and broadcast media \[10\]. 

 the inclusion of vector control tools has ensured that the WHO’s program to eliminate g\-HAT as a public health problem by 2020 is on track with, for example, the specific goal of less than 2,000 new cases reported annually being achieved from 2017 \(1,409 cases\) onwards \(2018, 953 cases; 2019, 864 cases\). These low numbers contrast with the decade between 2005 and 2014, prior to the inclusion of vector control, when the number of new cases reported globally ranged between 3,679 \(2014\) and 15,624 \(2005\) annually \[1\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research into pandemic preparedness at the University of Nottingham was adapted into the dexamethasone arm of the RECOVERY trial, from which dexamethasone was the first drug shown to improve survival of patients with severe respiratory complications from COVID\-19. In 2015, researchers at the University of Nottingham developed the multi\-centre Adjuvant Steroids in Adults with Pandemic Influenza \(ASAP\) trial, a clinical trial ‘in hibernation’ that was ready to be activated in a pandemic, as part of national preparedness planning for public health emergencies. Professor Wei Shen Lim is a core member of the RECOVERY trial team, and influenced the adaption of the ASAP trial in March 2020 to form the **dexamethasone arm** of the RECOVERY trial. This study arm demonstrated that dexamethasone could reduce death rates by **one\-third** in ventilated COVID\-19 patients. The World Health Organisation, the European Medicines Agency and the National Institutes of Health now recommend dexamethasone and it is now used worldwide for the treatment of ventilated COVID\-19 patients.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 **The problem** 

 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \(SARS\-CoV\-2\), the cause of coronavirus disease \(COVID\-19\), emerged in China in late 2019 from a zoonotic source. As of the 15<sup>th</sup> December 2020, the World Health Organization \(WHO\) reported over 70,000,000 COVID\-19 cases and 1,600,000 deaths globally since the start of the pandemic. A resurgence in the number of new cases in late 2020 and continued growth in some countries threatened high resource and low resource countries alike. 

 The majority of COVID\-19 cases present as asymptomatic or result in only mild disease. However, in a substantial percentage of patients, a respiratory illness requiring hospital care develops, and such infections can progress to critical illness with respiratory failure requiring prolonged ventilation support. Among patients with COVID\-19 who were admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom \(UK\) during the 2020 pandemic, the case fatality rate was approximately 26%, a percentage that increased to more than 37% among patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation. 

 At the outset of the pandemic, no therapeutic agents were known to reduce mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID\-19. Patients with severe COVID\-19 can develop a systemic inflammatory response that can lead to lung injury and multisystem organ dysfunction. It had been proposed that the potent anti\-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids, a class of corticosteroids, might prevent or mitigate these deleterious effects, but the value of these therapeutic interventions had been widely debated. The absence of reliable evidence from large\-scale randomised clinical trials meant there was uncertainty about the effectiveness of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID\-19. 

 **The research** 

 *ASAP trial* 

 In response to delays in research for 2009 influenza A/H1N1, in **2012** the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) funded a portfolio of projects, which were put on standby in a ‘hibernating’ state awaiting activation in the event of an influenza pandemic. In response to the COVID\-19 pandemic, these NIHR projects were repurposed and activated. 

 In **2012** Professor Wei Shen Lim led on the development of the multi\-centre Adjuvant Steroids in Adults with Pandemic Influenza \(ASAP\) trial, working with Dr Clare Brittain and Professor Lelia Duley at the University of Nottingham **\[1\]**. This trial was developed as a ‘hiberating’ clinical trial that was ready to be activated in a future pandemic, as part of national preparedness planning for public health emergencies. The trial was designed to evaluate whether or not low\-dose corticosteroids given as an adjunct to standard treatment is beneficial in patients hospitalised with severe pandemic influenza. 

 Hurdles to setting up a pandemic trial include planning for pandemic\-level pressures on UK NHS resources and co\-enrolment of patients to multiple pandemic studies, ensuring adequate geographical distribution of participating sites, maintaining long\-term low\-level engagement with site investigators, addressing future trial\-specific training needs of local investigators and resilience planning in trial management. The ASAP trial was set up with full ethics and regulatory approvals in place, ready for rapid activation at the onset of a pandemic. 

 *RECOVERY trial* 

 Professor Lim is a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Viruses Threats Advisory Group \(NERVTAG\) which advises the Department of Health and Social care on emerging viral respiratory threats. NERVTAG recommended the evaluation of low dose steroids in patients hospitalised with COVID\-19. In **March 2020**, the RECOVERY \(Randomised Evaluation of COVid\-19 thERapY\) trial was established as a randomised clinical trial to test a range of potential treatments for COVID\-19, including a study arm investigating the efficacy of low\-dose dexamethasone \(a steroid treatment\). The **dexamethasone arm** of the RECOVERY trial was adapted from the ASAP trial **\[2\]**. 

 In this controlled, open\-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with COVID\-19, a total of 2104 patients were randomly assigned to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone \(at a dose of 6 mg once daily\) for up to 10 days and 4321 patients to receive usual care **\[3\]**. The primary outcome measure was 28\-day mortality. In patients hospitalised with COVID\-19, the use of dexamethasone reduced deaths by one\-third in ventilated patients and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only. There was no benefit among those patients who did not require oxygen or respiratory support. Based on these results, **1 death would be prevented by treatment of around 8 ventilated patients or around 25 patients requiring oxygen alone.** 

 Professor Lim was actively involved in the **dexamethasone arm** of the RECOVERY trial as the co\-investigator on RECOVERY, is a member of the RECOVERY Trial Steering Committee and the Writing Committee and was **joint first author** on the peer\-reviewed publication of results **\[3\] \[A\]**.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Adapted from the ASAP trial, the **dexamethasone arm** of the RECOVERY trial provides evidence that treatment with dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg once daily for up to 10 days reduces 28\-day mortality in patients with COVID\-19 who are receiving respiratory support **\[2\]**. These findings indicate dexamethasone could reduce death rates by one\-third in ventilated COVID\-19 patients. 

 Dexamethasone was the first drug tested in the RECOVERY trial and is the first treatment to be shown to improve survival in patients with severe respiratory complications from COVID\-19. Dexamethasone is inexpensive, readily available and can be used immediately to save lives worldwide. Given the public health importance of these results, the World Health Organisation \(WHO\), the European medicines Agency \(EMA\), and countries such as the United Kingdom \(UK\) and the United States of America \(USA\) provided rapid response recommendations of the clinical use of dexamethasone, in order to reduce death rates. In July 2020, it was predicted that approximately 650,000 lives could be saved globally by January 2021 by using dexamethasone to treat COVID\-19 patients receiving respiratory support, assuming similar effect sizes in low and middle\-income countries **\[B\]**. 

 **WHO recommends dexamethasone treatment** 

 WHO provides clinical guidance on infectious disease treatment for all countries and health care systems. On **2<sup>nd</sup> September 2020**, WHO published guidance for clinicians and health care decision\-makers on the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID\-19, including the use of dexamethasone following the results from the RECOVERY trial **\[C\]**. The WHO Rapid Evidence Appraisal for COVID\-19 Therapies \(REACT\) Working Group used the preliminary published report **\[3\]** of the dexamethasone arm of the RECOVERY trial on **22<sup>nd</sup> June 2020** in their appraisal of the value of corticosteroids. WHO partnered with investigators of seven trials on corticosteroids to conduct a meta\-analysis of these trials, in order to rapidly provide additional evidence building on data from the RECOVERY trial and to inform guidance development **\[D\]**. 

 WHO partnered with the non\-profit Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation \(MAGIC\) for methodologic support, to develop and disseminate living guidance for COVID\-19 drug treatments **\[E\]**. WHO recommended systemic corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID\-19 **\[E\]**. Corticosteroids are listed in the WHO model list of essential medicines, and are readily available globally at a low cost, making it an effective medicine to recommend across both high\-income countries \(HICs\) and low and middle\-income countries \(LMICs\). In a press release to announce these corticosteroid guidelines for COVID\-19 use, the WHO encouraged countries ‘ *to maintain sufficient stocks of corticosteroids to treat COVID\-19 and the other disease for which they are effective, while not maintaining excessive stocks which could deny other countries access*’ **\[C\]**. 

 The WHO recommendation for treating patients with COVID\-19 is as follows: ‘ *The panel made two recommendations: a strong recommendation for systemic \(i.e. intravenous or oral\) corticosteroid therapy \(e.g. 6 mg of **dexamethasone** orally or intravenously daily or 50 mg of hydrocortisone intravenously every 8 hours\) for 7 to 10 days in patients with severe and critical COVID\-19, and a conditional recommendation not to use corticosteroid therapy in patients with non\-severe COVID\-19’* **\[E, pg.7\]**. 

 **United Kingdom recommends dexamethasone treatment** 

 Following the demonstrated clinical benefit in COVID\-19 patients in the dexamethasone RECOVERY trial study arm, on the **24<sup>th</sup> June 2020** the UK Government recommended dexamethasone for the management of hospitalised patients with COVID\-19 who require oxygen or ventilation **\[F\]**. Out of hospital treatment was recommended as not appropriate. 

 The UK Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said: ‘ *This is tremendous news today from the RECOVERY trial showing that dexamethasone is the first drug to reduce mortality from COVID\-19. It is particularly exciting as this is an inexpensive widely available medicine.* 

 *This is a ground\-breaking development in our fight against the disease, and the speed at which researchers have progressed finding an effective treatment is truly remarkable. It shows the importance of doing high quality clinical trials and basing decisions on the results of those trials*’ **\[G\]**. 

 For the UK, in July 2020 it was estimated that using dexamethasone to treat COVID\-19 patients receiving respiratory support may prevent **approximately 12,000 deaths** by January 2021 **\[B\]**. 

 **European Medicines Agency recommends dexamethasone treatment** 

 **In September 2020**, the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) reviewed evidence resulting from the dexamethasone RECOVERY trial study arm and concluded that dexamethasone can be considered a treatment option for patients with COVID\-19 who require oxygen therapy **\[H\]**. The recommended dose in adults and adolescents is 6mg once a day for up to 10 days, the same treatment used in the RECOVERY trial study arm. 

 **National Institutes of Health recommends dexamethasone treatment** 

 The National Institutes of Health \(NIH\), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is one of the world’s foremost medical research centres. On the basis of the preliminary report from the dexamethasone arm of the RECOVERY trial, the NIH now recommends using dexamethasone for the treatment of COVID\-19 in hospitalised patients who are mechanically ventilated and in hospitalised patients who require supplemental oxygen but who are not mechanically ventilated **\[I pg.1\]**. The Panel recommends against using dexamethasone for the treatment of COVID\-19 in patients who do not require supplemental oxygen. 

 **Recommendation of dexamethasone in individual countries** 

 Canada, Ireland, South Africa, and Belgium are among the various countries that recommend using dexamethasone to treat hospitalised cases of COVID\-19 who require oxygen or ventilation, all of which reference the RECOVERY trial as supporting evidence in this recommendation **\[J\]**. It was predicted that approximately 650,000 lives could be saved globally by January 2021 by using dexamethasone to treat COVID\-19 patients receiving respiratory support, assuming similar effect sizes in low and middle\-income countries **\[B\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 A key challenge for manufacturers has been to reduce the requirements for rare earth metals such as neodymium, dysprosium and terbium in the magnets used in electric vehicles as they are expensive and difficult to obtain. Working collaboratively with Toyota and a range of other partners in the EU and Japan, Professor Hrkac’s group at the University of Exeter has played a crucial role in the development of magnetic materials which require significantly lower levels of rare earth metals. These materials have been employed in an estimated 6.5 million hybrid vehicles produced by Toyota since 2016, **reducing consumption of rare earth elements by 450 tonnes**, with associated reductions in environmental damage. In addition, the use of the new magnetic materials has contributed to efficiency gains compared to standard hybrid vehicles which have **reduced carbon dioxide emissions from Toyota hybrid vehicles by 11 million tonnes** worldwide since 2016.  Professor Hrkac’s work also contributed to **cost savings of $108M in production and maintenance costs for hybrid cars** which enhanced job stability at Toyota and generated savings for consumers. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Prof. Hrkac’s research group focuses on computational and theoretical magnetism; specifically, the development of models to investigate the complex interface effects on an atomistic scale in nano\- and micro\-scale materials. Magnetic materials are formed from grains with a distinct magnetic structure. For most applications it is the overall magnetic material properties which are important; these are determined by the interaction between grains, so interfaces and grain boundaries ultimately determine the useful magnetic properties such as the external magnetic field, magnetic flux and magnetic energy density. 

 Supported by a Royal Society University Research Fellowship \(2009\-2014\), Prof. Hrkac developed *ab initio* simulations of atomic structures and solid\-state molecular dynamics to model the behaviour of amorphous and crystalline grain boundaries in neodymium \(NdFeB\) magnets. In this early work it was shown that for Nd<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>14</sub>B magnets, containing neodymium \(Nd\) but without rare earth element dysprosium \(Dy\), the coercivity was highly dependent upon local anisotropy profiles at grain boundaries **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. The significance of grain boundaries, highlighted by Prof Hrkac's work, was central to future magnet development. Further research highlighted the importance of Nd\-oxides **\[3.3\-3.5\]** and the potential for using structured magnetic materials **\[3.6\]**. 

 One of the key challenges in designing high efficiency magnets for use in hybrid and electric vehicles is that they must be able to operate at high temperature, whilst maintaining or improving the efficiency of the electric motors they are used to drive. When neodymium magnets are used at high temperatures, such as in automotive applications, other rare earth elements such as dysprosium or terbium \(Tb\) are generally added to increase high\-temperature coercivity. However, these are rare and expensive metals found in locations with high geopolitical risks. Because of this, considerable efforts have been made to develop magnets that do not use these metals. Although production volumes of neodymium are relatively high amongst rare earth metals, there are concerns that shortages will develop as electric vehicles become increasingly popular in the future. To overcome the issues regarding cost and availability of rare earth metals, Toyota established its Magnetic Materials for High\-Efficiency Motors \(MagHEM\) project in 2012, with the aim of developing technologies that would initially eliminate the use of terbium and dysprosium, and in the longer\-term reduce the amount of neodymium used, whilst maintaining the high levels of heat resistance and minimizing loss of coercivity. 

 As a result of his expertise, Prof. Hrkac played a leading role in the MagHEM project **\[5.1\]**, providing all the interface materials modelling, with colleagues in Europe and Japan responsible for other elements such as fabrication and testing. The first phase of the research led to the development of magnets requiring very low levels of dysprosium/terbium, which were used by Toyota in its 4th generation Prius, released in December 2015 \(Figure 1\) **\[5.2\]**. 


 Figure 1: Reduction of Tb/Dy from 3<sup>rd</sup> generation to 4<sup>th</sup> generation Prius. Figure adapted from **\[5.2\].** 


 The next phase of the work focused on reducing the neodymium content required, through the combination of three new technologies, all of which were dependent on Prof Hrkac’s modelling: 

 **I. Magnetic grain refinement** – high coercivity can be retained at high temperatures through the reduction of the size of the magnet grains to one\-tenth or less of those found in conventional neodymium magnets and the enlargement of the grain boundary area. This is shown in Figure 2 **\[5.2\]**, where the performance of the neodymium\-reduced magnet \(solid red line\) is seen to out\-perform the conventional neodymium magnet \(black line, squares\) at higher temperatures. Moreover, simply reducing the amount of neodymium, without changing the grain size significantly, reduces the magnet performance \(black line, diamonds\); 

 **II. Two\-layered high performance grain surface** – neodymium can be used more efficiently by increasing its concentration on the surface of the magnet grains and decreasing the concentration in the grain core, which results in a reduction in the overall amount of neodymium required whilst maintaining high levels of coercivity; 

 
 **\(⁰C\)**

These are: conventional Nd magnetic material \(black line, squares\); 20% reduced Nd using magnetic grain refinement \(red solid line, squares\); 50% reduced Nd using magnetic grain refinement \(red dashed line\); Nd\-reduced magnet without magnetic grain refinement \(black line, diamonds\). Adapted from **\[5.2\].** 

 * **III. A specific alloying ratio of lanthanum and cerium** –** normally, alloying neodymium with lanthanum and cerium results in a significant decline in its key properties of heat resistance and coercivity. However, by evaluating a range of alloy ratios, Toyota identified a specific ratio at which the deterioration of properties was minimised. 

 This programme of research and development led to the production by Toyota in 2018 of the world’s first neodymium\-reduced, heat resistant magnet, which uses no terbium or dysprosium \(Figure 2\). This new magnet has a wide range of potential applications in motors that require relatively high output; Toyota indicated that the magnets would be used in electric power steering motors for cars in the early 2020s, with plans for further development to enable their application in high performance electrified vehicle drive motors within the next 10 years \(i.e. by 2028\). **\[5.2\]**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Electric vehicles are an important element in meeting global goals on climate change, with hybrid vehicles fulfilling a key role in the transition period whilst charging infrastructures are put in place. This was re\-emphasised in February 2020 when the UK government announced a ban on petrol and diesel cars by 2030.  In 2019, just over 5.4 million hybrid and electric cars were sold worldwide, with a total market value of \~$160Bn. The market value is forecast to increase to almost $540Bn by 2024 **\[5.3\]**. Toyota Motor Corporation is a leading manufacturer of hybrid electric cars. In 2019 over 99.9% of Toyota’s electric vehicle sales were hybrids **\[5.2\]**. In the same year, Toyota sold 1.9 million hybrid vehicles worldwide \(35% of the total market\) **\[5.2\]**. 

 A key challenge for manufacturers has been to reduce the requirements for rare earth metals such as neodymium, dysprosium and terbium in the magnets used in electric vehicles, as they are expensive and difficult to obtain. As a key member of the MagHEM project, Prof Hrkac’s group at the University of Exeter has played a crucial role in the development of magnets which require significantly lower levels of rare earth metals, resulting in the major environmental and economic benefits detailed below and summarised in Figure 3. 

 **Decreased environmental damage through reduced use of rare earth metals – reduction of 450 tonnes dysprosium since 2016:** The mining of rare earth metals used in conventional hybrid motors negatively impacts the environment and surrounding communities, creating toxic waste and damaging the surrounding environment **\[5.9\]**. Furthermore, global supplies are limited, and demand is exceeding supply, with reserves expected to run out in the next five years. By using the newly developed low\-dysprosium magnet in its 4<sup>th</sup> generation Prius and other hybrid electric vehicles since 2016, Toyota has reduced consumption of dysprosium by an estimated 450 tonnes\*, reducing the carbon footprint and the environmental damage associated with production of these vehicles. In the short term, this work has freed up the limited dysprosium supplies for use in other vital applications such as wind turbines. In the longer term, it has made a lasting difference by demonstrating that it is possible to use alternatives to the rare earth metals traditionally used in electric vehicles. 

 In addition, by bringing magnet production in\-house during the joint development project, Toyota has been able to instigate a recall programme aimed at recycling electromotors and recovering rare earth materials to further limit environmental impact in the future **\[5.10\]**. 

 *\* The estimated 450 tonnes saving is calculated from an 84% reduction \(Figure 1\) in dysprosium, i.e. from 83g per car \[see Hoenderdaal, et al. \(2013\), Energy Vol. 49, Pages 344\-355\] to 13g per car. Scaling the saving by 6.5 million cars produced since 2016 gives the estimated figure.* 


 *Figure 3: Summary of impacts from new magnetic materials in hybrid cars.* 


 **Decreased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to increased fuel efficiency – 11 million tonnes less CO<sub>2</sub> since 2016:** The use of newly developed magnetic materials contributed to reductions in the size of the motor \(35%\) leading to improvements in motor efficiency of 20% **\[5.4\]**. Together with other design refinements, this enabled Toyota to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in its 4<sup>th</sup> generation Prius by 21% **\[5.2\].** Assuming similar levels of efficiency savings on their other hybrid vehicles, this has led to estimated savings in carbon dioxide emissions of 11 million tonnes since 2016. This saving in CO<sub>2</sub> is equivalent to the average yearly emission associated with more than 1.8 million homes **\[5.5\].** Efficiency savings from these new magnetic materials are also projected to be more significant in the future in applications such as robotics and fully electric cars **\[5.1\]**. 

 **Decreased production costs leading to increased confidence in the market, greater job stability at Toyota and savings for consumers**:* The reduced use of rare earth metals results in significant reductions in production costs: for example, the decreased levels of dysprosium used since 2016 has resulted in estimated cost savings of $108M \(estimated from the 450 tonnes saving, see above, and the $240/kg market value of dysprosium **\[5.6\]\).** This will translate into cheaper access to electric vehicles for consumers as well as increased confidence for automotive manufacturers that they can acquire the resources needed for future production of electric vehicles. Furthermore, the newly developed magnets have improved durability, leading to reduced maintenance costs over the lifetime of the vehicle, another positive benefit for consumers. Toyota has benefitted in other ways as well: by moving the development and production of magnets in\-house \(Prof Hrkac has also worked closely with Toyota on this project and has trained Toyota engineers in simulation techniques\); it has acquired intellectual property rights in this area **\[5.7\];** and has security over future production. This has contributed to job stability and sustainability at the company. 

 **Wider implications for neodymium reduced magnets:** This case study has focused on the impacts that have been delivered to date by Toyota through the use of improved, low\-dysprosium magnets in its hybrid and electric vehicles \(Figure 2\). However, in 2018 and as noted above, further development based on Prof Hrkac’s research has also led to the production by Toyota of the world’s first neodymium\-reduced, heat resistant magnet, which uses no terbium or dysprosium \(Figure 1\). Toyota indicated that the magnets would be used in electric power steering for cars in the early 2020s, with plans for further development to enable their application in high performance electrified vehicle drive motors within the next 10 years \(i.e. by 2028\) **\[5.2\]**. In addition to applications in hybrid and electric vehicles, the magnets will have wider potential use in robots and other household appliances, a huge and growing market: the household robots market is expected to grow from $3.3Bn in 2019 to $9.1Bn by 2024 **\[5.8\].** 

 **Summary statement:** Working collaboratively with Toyota and a range of other partners in the EU and Japan, Prof Hrkac has played a crucial role in modelling and development of new magnetic materials which require significantly lower levels of rare earth metals. These novel materials have been employed in an estimated 6.5 million hybrid vehicles produced by Toyota since 2016. This has reduced the consumption of rare earth elements by 450 tonnes, with associated reductions in environmental damage, reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from Toyota hybrid vehicles by 11 million tonnes and contributed to efficiency gains which have led to cost savings of $108M

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The EU has acknowledged that sport has a “specific nature” \(Article 165 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU\). However, it is not always clear how far EU law affords sports bodies autonomy to devise sporting rules designed to protect this specificity. Professor Parrish’s highly distinctive body of work has provided an evidence base informing the approaches of national and international sports bodies and EU institutions to this question. Specifically, his work on the regulation of football agents significantly contributed to the adoption of new global football agent regulations and informed the EU’s perspective on the scrutiny of the sector. Likewise, his work on nationality discrimination in sport has helped alter the EU’s approach to this issue whilst setting the boundaries for sports bodies on questions of nationality\-based eligibility rules. In these areas, the European Commission considers that Parrish’s work has left a “long\-lasting impact” \(Source 1\). Impacts claimed are: \(1\) Providing expertise informing the adoption of FIFA’s global football agent regulations and informing the European Commission’s approach to the scrutiny of football agent regulations applicable in Europe \(impacts 1\-3 below\) & \(2\) Informing the approach of the Court of Justice of the EU and the European Commission to their assessment of nationality\-based rules in sport, thus significantly impacting on sporting practices across Europe \(impacts 4\-5 below\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 *Research on EU sports law:* Parrish has built an influential body of literature exploring the boundaries of the ‘autonomy’ and ‘specificity’ of sport in EU law. His “truly ground\-breaking” \( *Journal of European Affairs*, 2004 2\(2\)\) monograph *Sports Law and Policy in the European Union* \(reference 3.1\) was the first book to capture this debate within a theoretical framework and his later monograph *The Sporting Exception in European Union Law* \(reference 3.2\) examined how certain sporting practices that give rise to restrictive effects could be accommodated within EU law. His work resulted in him being asked to provide high\-level advice to the EU institutions on their approach to the sports sector \(Source 1, para.1\) and his contribution to the discipline was acknowledged with his 2016 award of Jean Monnet Chair of EU Sports Law and Policy. 

 *Research on sports agents:* Parrish’s 872\-page *Players’ Agents Worldwide: Legal Aspects* \(reference 3.3\) was the first book to provide a comprehensive comparative perspective on the legal and regulatory position facing football agents across 40 countries. The book highlighted varying regulatory practice across the countries examined, with an attendant lack of uniformity. In 2015, FIFA replaced its Player Agent Regulations \(PAR\), the system on which the 2007 book was based, with the Regulations on the Working with Intermediaries \(RWWI\). Within this entirely new regulatory system, Parrish observed some regulatory flaws in the approach and sought to provide an evidence\-base to inform new thinking on the issue. After being asked by the European Commission to chair a meeting of sports stakeholders to discuss agent regulation \(in Malta in March 2017\), Parrish secured EU funding to provide further evidence on the efficacy of the RWWI and options for reform. Between 2018 and 2019, he led the EUR211,000 study, *Promoting and Supporting Good Governance in the European Football Agents Industry* \(reference 3.4\). The study was the product of extensive research including a mapping exercise covering the regulations and legal context of 31 countries, consultation with an extensive network of national experts and wide stakeholder consultation via a questionnaire and the staging of six regional stakeholder seminars. The outputs from this study, details of which are provided below \(Interim Report 2018 and Final Report 2019\) build substantially on Parrish’s earlier underpinning research and made influential and evidenced recommendations on regulatory reform, many of which were incorporated into the proposals agreed by FIFA’s Football Stakeholders Committee and the FIFA Council in 2019. The study also informed European Commission strategy on potential regulatory interventions in the sector. 

 *Research on nationality discrimination:* In 2010, Parrish co\-authored a study for the European Commission entitled, *Study on the Equal Treatment of Non\-nationals in Individual Sports Competitions* \(reference 3.5\). The study, awarded by competitive tender, was funded by the EU following a commitment made by the European Commission in its 2007 White Paper on Sport to examine the pattern of nationality discrimination in individual sports across the EU. Parrish acted as ‘High\-Level EU Sports Law Expert’. Following extensive research including widescale stakeholder consultation, the study advanced new arguments that deviated from an orthodox understanding of the application of EU law \(discussed below\), yet which nine years later were endorsed by the Court of Justice of the European Union \(CJEU\) in case C\-22/18. In 2013, Parrish, acting in the capacity as ‘High\-Level Legal Expert’, also co\-authored the European Commission’s second major study into discriminatory practices in European Sport \- *Study on the Assessment of UEFA’s Home\-Grown Player Rule*, \(reference 3.6\). This legal study, evidenced with econometric analysis and stakeholder consultation, highlighted how UEFA’s flagship rule gave rise to indirect nationality discrimination, which was capable of being justified under EU law, subject to proportionality control. The study was described as “a thoroughly impressive piece of work” \(Stephen Weatherill \(2017\), *Principles and Practice in EU Sports Law*, Oxford, p.197\). The European Commission stated, “\[t\]he political and policy debates were significantly informed by findings and recommendations of these studies” \(Source 1\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Parrish’s underpinning research \(references 3.1, 3.2 & 3.3\) were significant factors in his appointment to a senior advisory role in the EU and through this he was central in establishing both agent regulation and nationality discrimination in European sport as priority themes for the EU \(Source 1, para.1\). Following the adoption of the EU’s first competence for sport in 2009 \(Articles 6 and 165 TFEU\), in 2010 European Commissioner Vassiliou appointed Parrish to a Group of \(ten\) Independent European Sports Experts to advise the Commission on priorities in the field of sport prior to the adoption of the EU’s Communication on Sport in 2011 \(Com \(2011\) 12 final, 18/01/2011\). In its final report for the Commissioner, published in 2010, the group highlighted the “general lack of transparency regarding financial flows, especially in connection with transfers” and it stated that “the EU should promote self\-regulation by both sport organisations and associations of agents”. In relation to discriminatory practices in European sport, the group highlighted “the principle of equality in sporting competitions” and that “more stringent measures should be adopted to fight racism and discrimination in sport”. Parrish’s role in the group was fundamental to these issues bring prioritised, as evidenced by his underpinning research that advocated greater EU action in the areas of agent regulation and nationality discrimination in sport. The 2011 Communication on Sport acknowledged the contribution of the group \(at p.4\), endorsed its findings and prioritised, inter alia, “transfer rules and the activities of agents” and “free movement and nationality of sportspeople” \(Source 2\). 

 **The Regulation of Football Agents** 

 In November 2017, FIFA committed to conduct a review of the transfer system and the regulation of agents operating within it. This resulted in FIFA, throughout 2018/19, working with the football stakeholders to set the principles underpinning new transfer and agent regulations. Initially, this work was carried out by FIFA’s Task Force Transfer System with the principles of the new regulations being approved by FIFA’s Football Stakeholder Committee \(Sept 2018\) and ultimately endorsed by the FIFA Council \(Oct 2019\). Three impacts are claimed in relation to this process. 

 *Impact 1: Informing FIFA’s global reforms:* In order to provide evidence\-based decision\-making, FIFA distributed reference 3.4 to members of its Task Force. Parrish and Cattaneo \(project RA and submitted to this UoA\) also held discussions with FIFA in Zurich on the substance of the Report \(09/18\). Reference 3.4 highlighted a number of flaws in the RWWI including a lack of regulatory consistency, questionable standards of professionalism and a general absence of effective dispute resolution and stakeholder consultation. It then made recommendations on agent reform including: a return to a licensing system including examination and education requirements for agents; better regulation of agent payments, including a possible fee cap, a ‘player pays’ model and the introduction of a ‘clearing\-house’ for the payment of agent fees; greater stakeholder involvement in the reform process; and stronger dispute resolution and sanction procedures. Following the conclusion of the Task Force process, these recommendations were accepted by FIFA’s Football Stakeholder Committee and the FIFA Council \(Source 4\). According to the European Football Agents Association \(EFAA\), the body representing agents in the discussions, the study “resulted in a change of approach” and “\[w\]ithout your evidence EFAA would have struggled to persuade FIFA to change its mind and reform the system”. EFAA stated that “FIFA acted on a large number of the recommendations made in your report” and that the changes “will improve professional standards in the industry” \(Source 5\). FIFA stated that the study “greatly assisted” it by “providing ideas and evidence on what the existing problems were, what could be achieved and how” with FIFA noting that “\[w\]e agree with the vast majority of the recommendations made in your study and this provided FIFA and the stakeholders with much needed evidence for us to proceed with many far\-reaching changes to our regulations”. The research “helped us address two of the most challenging aspects of agent regulation, namely remuneration and representation restrictions”. Based on the research, the changes to the regulations “will greatly enhance standards of professionalism, ethics and compliance” \(Source 3\). In its final evaluation of the project, the European Commission noted that the study had a “big impact at European level since the research presented several recommendations which have been agreed in principle by the FIFA”. 

 *Impact 2: Supporting football stakeholders:* In line with his previous research findings \(references 3.1, 3.2 & 3.3\), reference 3.4 argued for stakeholder participation as a means of promoting good governance, a feature absent in previous iterations of the agent regulations. Parrish put in place a strategy facilitating this. He staged six EU funded stakeholder events across Europe throughout 2018 and 2019 at which the key stakeholders, including FIFA, met. The 2018 Interim Report acted as the basis for discussion. Members of the Task Force routinely attended the events, thus informing their Task Force discussions. These events contributed to better mutual understanding between FIFA and EFAA, resulting in agreement on some key principles between the parties \(such as a return to a licensing system and better dispute resolution\) and much more formal dialogue between FIFA and EFAA during the reform process. FIFA “welcomed \[the\] recommendations on inclusive stakeholder involvement in the preparation of the new regulations and particularly the importance of discussions with agents themselves” and it observed that the stakeholder seminars organised by Parrish throughout the reform process “brought together the main stakeholders from football and this encouraged dialogue, understanding of the issues and ultimately this will improve compliance with the new regulations” and this “has made for better decision making in this area” \(Source 3\). The European Commission commented that the six regional seminars “helped bring stakeholders together and fostered better mutual understanding” \(Source 1\). EFAA stated, “…as a result of your report, FIFA has taken its first ever steps at entering genuine discussion with agents… the focus in your report on good governance requirements in EU law changed FIFA’s approach” \(Source 5\). It continued, “\[t\]oday both the European Commission and FIFA recognise EFAA as a critical body within professional football, and your work \[references 3.1 and 3.2\] has been fundamental to this. This is why between 2018 and 2020 we invited you to participate in our events in Paris, London and Zurich. At those events your explanation of the political and legal context within the EU has helped determine our strategy” \(Source 5\). Consequently, it is claimed that the underpinning research that focussed on the importance of inclusive stakeholder participation as an essential feature of good governance contributed to better regulation of the agents industry. This benefitted key stakeholders, notably football clubs and players \(who tend to be young and vulnerable to exploitation\) as they are better protected from poor industry practice, particularly arising from conflicts of interest and excessive fee demands by agents. Professional agents and agencies benefit from the protection qualitative entry requirements \(licensing\) imposed on those wanting to enter the profession and ethical standards are enhanced through the ongoing education requirement. Our strategy helped build trust between stakeholders and the underpinning research enhanced the quality of debate amongst them, resulting in changes in attitude and informed decision making at FIFA level. 

 *Impact 3: Informing the EU’s approach to agent regulation:* Initially in its 2007 White Paper on Sport, the Commission highlighted that it faced “repeated calls” for it to adopt legislation to regulate the activities of agents \(at s.4.4\). Parrish’s research and expert advice resulted in the Commission favouring enhanced self\-regulation. In 2017, Parrish chaired a meeting of sports stakeholders at the European Sport Forum in Malta to discuss the regulation of sports agents. He then spoke at Commission events in Brussels \(09/18 & 12/19\), Bucharest \(04/19\) and at a meeting of EU Sports Directors at the Austrian Presidency meeting \(12/18\). These appointments were made as a result of “\[t\]he quality of Professor Parrish \(sic\) work and the level of his expertise on EU sports law and policy” \(Source 1\). Regarding his work on agents, “the quality of his research was a valuable contribution that allowed the Commission to build a better understanding of professional football ecosystem and advancing discussions with football stakeholders on a bilateral basis or through Social Dialogue committee setup at EU level on professional football” \(Source 1\). The research on agents “informed Commission’s views and helped it in dealing with the global governing body \(FIFA\) that later decided to take a more proactive approach on regulating football agent activities,” \(Source 1\). The study also informed debates in national contexts as witnessed by the reference to it in chapter 5 of the German Bundestag report, Möglichkeit von Gehaltsobergrenzen im Fußball für Spieler und Berater sowie der Deckelung von Ablösesummen \(Possibility of Salary Caps in Football for Players and Consultants as Well as the Capping of Transfer Fees\), 21/07/20. 

 **Nationality Discrimination in European Sport** 

 *Impact 4: Nationality discrimination in individual sports:* Reference 3.5 was important and ground\-breaking research in that, for the first time, the nationality\-based eligibility regulations of 26 Olympic sports across all 27 Member States of the EU were systematically examined, legally assessed and recommendations made. The study identified widespread sporting practice that was potentially in conflict with EU law. In particular, many sportsmen and women were being denied access to sporting competitions on account of their nationality, a characteristic protected under EU law. The orthodox interpretation of EU law asserted that individuals are able to rely on EU non\-discrimination laws when carrying out economic activity. The research argued that due to EU citizenship rights and the adoption of Article 165 TFEU \(the sports competence\), economic activity does not necessarily need to be present for EU citizens to be entitled to equal treatment with nationals. Therefore, it was argued, national sporting competitions and championships should, in principle, be ‘open\-access’ unless the specific nature of sport could be invoked to justify the proportionate exclusion of non\-nationals. This claim also ran counter to EU law orthodoxy which stated that directly discriminatory measures, such as nationality restrictions, cannot be justified under EU law beyond the expressly stated Treaty derogations. The recommendations were, therefore, ground\-breaking. Eventually, in Case C\-22/18 *TopFit e.V Daniele Biffi v Deutscher Leichtathletikverband e.V.* \( *TopFit*\), the approach was tested by the Court of Justice of the European Union. In the case, an Italian national living in Germany was prevented from competing in the German amateur athletics championships on the same basis as Germans. The Advocate General \(AG\) recommended an orthodox approach by requiring economic activity to be present before individuals could avail themselves of Treaty protections but reference 3.5 was cited at paragraphs 32, 44 and 77 of the AG Opinion as the study’s arguments were reviewed. However, the CJEU departed from this reasoning and followed the argument expressed in reference 3.5 that the athlete in question is protected from discriminatory nationality measures adopted by both states and private bodies, such as sporting entities, under EU citizenship rights regardless of the level of economic activity being carried out \(the athlete in question was an amateur\). The Court then agreed with the reasoning that the specific nature of sport could be invoked to grant limited exceptions to this principle, thus endorsing the argument expressed in reference 3.5 that measures that directly discriminate on the grounds of nationality should, in principle, be capable of justification under EU law. In doing so, the Court of Justice “outlined similar arguments as in the non\-nationals study” \(Source 1\). The significance of this impact lies both in the doctrinal developments stemming from this approach and also the impact the judgment has had on sporting practices across Europe. 

 *Impact 5: Nationality discrimination in team sport:* A second major enquiry into nationality discrimination in European sport, this time team sport, was launched by the European Commission in 2012 and published in 2013 \(reference 3.6\). The study assessed the legality, under EU law, of UEFA’s home\-grown player rule, first introduced into European football in the 2006/07 season. The study argued that the rule gave rise to the prospect of indirect discrimination on the grounds of nationality, but that the rule pursued legitimate sporting objectives. The study claimed that the proportionality of the rule was questionable, even though the rule did not give rise to manifestly restrictive effects, but that the Commission should not adopt a negative decision on the compatibility of the rule with EU law. The study contributed to the Commission’s assessment not to adopt infringement actions against UEFA and it has informed the approach of the Commission to disputes arising out of the use of home\-grown player rules in European sport. In 2014, in a ‘reasoned opinion’ under its infringement procedures, the Commission requested that Spain alter the rules on the composition of basketball teams as the quotas resulted in indirect indiscrimination towards players from other Member States. In line with the finding from the 2013 study, the Commission accepted as legitimate the objectives put forward by Spain to justify these rules, but it considered that Spain failed to demonstrate the appropriateness and proportionality of the quotas for each competition. In arriving at that position, the Commission used UEFA’s quota as a reference point. It noted that whereas 32% of squad places in football are reserved for home\-grown players, in Spanish Basketball the quota ranged between 40% and 88% \(Source 6\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Building on a rich local heritage of mathematics, University of Lincoln researchers have informed and shaped public attitudes to research in pure mathematics, through a series of lectures and school outreach events. This has fostered interest and enhanced engagement in mathematics research among school children \(via Headstart Programme\) and in rural communities who have limited opportunities to engage with research of this kind. These activities challenged the pervasive idea that all mathematics is known by highlighting the contribution of recent research in algebra conducted at the University of Lincoln, and featured in events for STEM at the Houses of Parliament, and talks to support strategies to encourage girls to study mathematics at university. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Algebra is one of the foundations of mathematics and provides a language for applications of mathematics in physics, chemistry and other sciences. Research undertaken within the Charlotte Scott Research Centre for Algebra at the University of Lincoln is focused on group theory, which is the study of symmetries in abstract structures. Specifically, the research conducted includes the study of permutation groups, pro\-p groups, number\-theoretic aspects in groups and commutativity properties in groups; areas that have potential applications in cryptography and computer science. 

 The commutativity property in group theory is a wonderful topic for outreach, since it is so simple for school children to grasp: multiplication of numbers is commutative, but multiplication of matrices is not. Commutativity is one of the important properties a group can possess, and the research on this topic aims to achieve greater commutativity of important classes of groups and develop novel Lie rings methods for the study of groups. Among recent new results obtained by Khukhro are theorems on commutativity properties of groups and Lie rings admitting almost fixed\-point\-free automorphisms **\[3.3\].** This is a classical area of group theory and the theory of Lie rings, which still contains important open problems about automorphisms of composite order. Another set of results is about finite and profinite groups satisfying generalised Engel conditions, and novel applications of the famous Zelmanov theorem reductions **\[3.1\]**. A third result involves studying an important class of infinite groups in which restrictions have been placed on certain subgroups that control aspects of commutativity **\[3.2\]**. 

 Permutation group theory can be illustrated to non\-specialists using diagrams of group actions. There is a natural way of decomposing permutation groups into smaller groups. Groups that are indecomposable in this way are called primitive and play a fundamental role in group theory. When taking a “product” of two groups, it seems intuitively that one should not end up with a primitive group. For approximately 100 years the only product known to preserve primitivity was the wreath product, but in **\[3.5\]** Smith discovered a new product, called the box product, that also preserves primitivity. The beauty of the box product, from the perspective of outreach, is that it can easily be described using attractive fractal\-like diagrams. 

 Thillaisundaram’s research concerns pro\-p groups, and investigates their Hausdorff dimension, which is a generalisation of our usual concept of integer dimension to non\-integer dimension. Hausdorff dimension was first applied in the 1930s to fractals and shapes in nature, and is a frequently used topic for outreach. For a given pro\-p group, the Hausdorff dimension of a subgroup tells us how dense the subgroup is in the whole group. The collection of the Hausdorff dimensions of all subgroups in a given group is called a Hausdorff spectrum. The research **\[3.6\]** involves constructing pro\-p groups with extremely infinite Hausdorff spectra, which has answered several open questions in the field, and motivated the development of further research areas. 

 Other research in the Charlotte Scott Research Centre for Algebra is of a number\-theoretic nature, and studies power series whose coefficients are an integer sequence of some combinatorial relevance: this is often called the “generating function” of the sequence. Power series are an accessible topic for A\-Level students. The particular research on which some outreach was based concerns generating functions that admit a closed form C\(x\) \(which is, roughly, a “simple expression” for the sum of the series\). Instances are known, or being discovered, where the finite sum obtained by discarding all terms of degree q or higher, with q a power of a prime p, also admits a closed form representation when viewed modulo p. Such a representation for the truncated sum modulo p frequently bears some resemblance with the shape of C\(x\), which however is only partial and often far from obvious. In **\[3.4\]** Mattarei and Tauraso have developed a method to directly infer the closed form representation of the truncated sum from the closed form of the series, for a class of series with coefficients of combinatorial significance.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The School of Mathematics and Physics engages in a range of outreach activities to communicate the school’s research and promote public interest in maths. Researchers in the Charlotte Scott Research Centre for Algebra have delivered a range of talks, activities and posters, aimed at members of the public, university students, school children and politicians. These have presented recent research breakthroughs from the centre in a way that was easily accessible to non\-specialists. The overarching aim of these was to: \(a\) dispel the pervasive idea that all mathematics is known, \(b\) show that original research in pure mathematics remains important, and \(c\) show that important research in pure mathematics is taking place in Lincolnshire. The events below transformed the views of local, national and international audiences. 

 **Engaging students and dispelling myths in the Headstart Programme.** Headstart **\[5.1\]** is a programme run by the Engineering Development Trust \(EDT\), and is part of EDT's national strategy to encourage school pupils to have an interest and involvement in science and engineering. Headstart is for students aged 16\-17.  The School of Mathematics and Physics has sustained an ongoing relationship with the Headstart programme, and has hosted 30 Headstart students per year since 2017. Hosting it in Lincoln makes Headstart accessible for students coming from rural communities in the East Midlands. As part of this programme, Khukhro, Mattarei and Smith deliver lectures that cover their research breakthroughs in pure mathematics, using audience\-appropriate methods to engage students. As noted in **\[5.1\]**: 

 i. Examples were used to explain Khukhro’s commutativity\-type conditions, to dispel   the misconception that everything in pure mathematics is known and demonstrate to   the audience the essence of a cutting\-edge result in pure mathematics **\[3.3\]**. 

 ii. Smith’s discovery of a new product for permutation groups \(‘box product’\) **\[3.5\]** was   described in pictorial form to help students understand this complex phenomenon.    The lecture focused on how dramatic research breakthroughs can happen simply by   shifting one’s perspective. 

 iii. The recursive structure of Pascal's triangle when viewed modulo a prime number    was presented. Progressing from this, simple polynomial tools were developed in the   lecture, which then allowed the audience to appreciate one key idea behind recent   research by Mattarei and Tauraso **\[3.4\]**, relating certain types of power series with   their truncated versions modulo a prime. 

 After attending the lectures, students' perception of mathematical research had changed **\[5.1\].** In particular, 61% of students became more interested in pure mathematics as a subject, 46% of students felt that being able one day to prove their own new theorem seemed more achievable, 79% of students felt that becoming a professional mathematician would be more achievable, and 93% of students felt that they had achieved a better understanding of what pure mathematics is. 

 **Public Lectures.** 

 The School of Mathematics and Physics organises several annual public lectures, named after notable figures in the history of mathematics and physics associated with Lincolnshire, including George Boole, who was born in Lincoln and was one of the most influential mathematical minds of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and Charlotte Scott, a 19th century algebraist who was influential in the development of American mathematics, including the mathematical education of women. These talks allow rural communities in Lincolnshire to engage with points \(a\)\-\(c\) above. Khukhro has given two of these public lectures; audiences were members of the public and included many school children from Lincolnshire, with feedback **\[5.2\]** for events demonstrating clear evidence of public engagement with points \(a\)\-\(c\). 

-  <ins>2015, ""George Boole: legacy of a mathematics revolutionary</ins>”, \(107 attendees\). The  lecture covered logic from its origins to modernity, and its applications to group  theory. Central to this talk was Khukhro’s **\[3.2\]** research that resulted from applying  logic to group theory. An attendee wrote, “ *The lecture showed the power of the*  *mathematical advances that are made by researchers such as those at the Lincoln*  *School. Pure mathematics can seem very esoteric to the layman, but the lecture*  *showed…how it lays the foundation for all of our modern world.”* **\[5.2\].** 

-  <ins>2018, “</ins><ins>Is algebra a spoilsport in mathematics?”</ins><ins>,</ins> \(119 attendees\). Central to this talk  was Khukhro’s research **\[3.1\]** on commutativity\-type conditions. Attendees wrote,  “ *opening up such a crucial subject to a broad audience in such a wonderful way is*  *massively important for Lincoln*” **\[5.2\],** and “ *I left with the knowledge that highly*  *important algebraic innovations are in progress, at the University of Lincoln. I also*  *understood, for the first time, that research in mathematics is still taking place, and*  *that it is important*” **\[5.2\].** 

 Khukhro repeated the 2015 lecture in Brazil and Russia, bringing points \(a\)\-\(c\) to an international audience. 

-  2016, University Public Lecture, University of Brasilia, Brazil \(40 attendees\). 

-  2017, University Public Lecture, University of Novosibirsk, Russia \(40 attendees\). 

 **Houses of Parliament STEM for Britain Event.** 

 In March 2019, Thillaisundaram presented her research **\[3.6\]** on Hausdorff dimensions of pro\-p groups at the event STEM for Britain, organised by the Houses of Parliament Parliamentary and Scientific Committee, held in Westminster. Her poster included the origins of Hausdorff dimensions in the study of fractals and the leap made to applying Hausdorff dimensions to pro\-p groups, highlighting points \(a\)\-\(c\) above to the audience. The audience was mostly Parliamentarians \( **\[5.3\]** and  [<ins>http://www.stemforbritain.org.uk/</ins>](http://www.stemforbritain.org.uk/)\). 

 **Women in Mathematics.** 

 Many activities promoting women in mathematics have been organised by the Charlotte Scott Research Centre for Algebra. At these events, current research from the centre is used to highlight points \(a\)\-\(c\) above. For example, in March 2017, Thillaisundaram organised a Newton Academy mathematics event for schoolgirls, held at the University of Lincoln. The event included talks on Thillaisundaram’s research, with a problem\-solving opportunity for the participants. In March 2019, Thillaisundaram spoke on her research on Hausdorff dimensions of pro\-p groups \( **\[3.6\]**\) at the Bishop Grosseteste University Girls in Mathematics Day, which was sponsored by the London Mathematical Society. Thillaisundaram introduced fractals and the current open problems in the study of Hausdorff dimensions of pro\-p groups. Several attendees of this event listed Thillaisundaram’s session as their favourite \( **\[5.4\]**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by the University of Stirling showed that a high proportion \(>50%\) of discarded prawns that were required to be landed under the 2014 reformed EU Common Fisheries Policy \(CFP\) can survive if returned at sea. This research led to the following impacts: 

 **Impact 1**: Our research provided key evidence that led the European Commission to grant a ‘high survivability exemption’ within the EU CFP implementing regulations. 

 **Impact 2**: The exemption has benefited the viability and avoided additional costs for fishers, estimated at around GBP3,200,000 over the claimed period \(Jan 2019\-Dec 2020\). 

 **Impact 3**: The exemption also avoided law enforcement and security practices that would have been needed if landing discarded prawns was implemented. 

 **Impact 4**: The environmental and future sustainability of the prawn fishing industry has benefited from the more than 105,000,000 prawns per annum that are now returned to Northern European fishing grounds, reducing increased overall mortality in a key commercially exploited stock. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2014, the EU Common Fisheries Policy \(CFP\) introduced a discard ban, which enforces the landing of all caught, commercially regulated species. Landed ‘discards’, which previously were disposed of at sea, are mainly composed of small and unmarketable animals. Under this latest CFP, undersized landed discards cannot be sold directly for human consumption but nevertheless need to be landed by law. While such a policy encourages selectivity, the landing of discards with high survivability is contra\-productive from a conservation perspective, and would be an economic and practical burden to the fishery that would have to deal with the storage and disposal of these animals and for regulators as new law enforcement mechanisms would be required. 

 Within this context, research led by the University of Stirling investigated the survival of discarded prawns \( *Nephrops norvegicus*\) from commercial trawling vessels operating in the North Sea \(ICES Area 4\) and the West of Scotland \(ICES Sub\-area 6a\), key grounds where most of the UK quota is allocated \(note that the UK prawn fishery accounts for more than 50% of total EU landings\). In 2015, a number of trials led by Stirling in collaboration with Scottish Association for Marine Science \(SAMS\) were conducted in the West of Scotland using a commercial trawl\-vessel that was supplying to the live market \( *Research funded project ‘Post\-catch survivability of discarded under\-sized Norway lobsters \(Nephrops norvegicus\): Towards a regional and ecosystems\-based approach*’\). The physiological condition and initial behavioural responses of discarded prawns from this vessel were used to estimate survival after 48 hours. Results from this study showed that although short\-term survival was high \(around 90%\), survival was negatively affected by a number of factors such as the level of physical damage and the animal’s post\-catch physiological condition which was more compromised in the summer season \( **R1\-R2**\). If such factors were taken into consideration a conservative estimate for discard survival was around 63\-88%. This Stirling research demonstrated that the initial survival estimates for trawl\-caught *Nephrops* used by the CFP \(25%\) were too low and highlighted the need for more accurate estimates of survival. Furthermore, the Working Group *on Methods for Estimating* Discard Survival \(WGMEDS\) from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas \(ICES\), which provides impartial advice to governments, recommended that discarded animals should be monitored for a longer time period and that trials should take place using vessels that are representative of the wider fleet, which targets high\-volume catches. 

 **\(C\)** 

Further research at Stirling estimated survival of discarded prawns in the wider fleet in West coast and North Sea grounds \( *Research funded project* *‘Post\-catch survivability of discarded Norway lobsters \(Nephrops norvegicus\): Further investigations within the large\-scale fleet operation’*\). Survival estimates of over 3,000 discarded *Nephrops* were obtained using the captive observation method with monitoring periods of up to 13 days. Data from the wider fleet was obtained in collaboration with the Scottish Fisheries Federation observer’s programme. The research established that survival of discarded prawns was consistently above 50% \( **R3\-R4**\). Furthermore, observations using a remotely operated underwater vehicle \(ROV\) indicated that discarded undamaged prawns were capable of exploring their immediate surroundings within 10\-15 min of being discarded and would be able to find shelter if released in suitable grounds \( **R3**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Impact 1: Informing EU Policy makers on implementation of fisheries legislation** 

 The reformed CFP allows Member States to elaborate joint recommendations for regional management measures that are specific to their fisheries \(Article 18\). Joint recommendations can be submitted to the European Commission for policy adoption via delegated acts. Marine Scotland used our report \( **R3**\) as the evidence base to demonstrate to the European Commission that the current discard ban negatively affected the *Nephrops* fishery. The report contains all the survival trials performed in both West Scotland and North Sea and showed that more than 50% of the discarded animals survive according to current practices in these fleets. As quoted by Paul McCarthy, Policy officer, Discard Team at Marine Scotland: 

 ‘*we are going to use your report as \[the\] evidence base to argue for a high survival exemption for Nephrops caught in trawls in both the North Sea and North Western waters.*’ \( **S1**\) 

 Therefore, data presented in **R3** was directly used by the North Sea \( **S2**\) and North Western Waters \( **S3**\) Regional Groups, from which the UK take most of the quota, to argue for an exemption in their Joint Recommendations that were sent to the EU Commission. 

 Before Joint Recommendations from all regional groups are assessed by the EU Commission, reports and associated evidence, including **R3**, were evaluated by the Scientific and Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries \(STECF\) \( **S4**\), which highlighted: 

 ‘*the supporting scientific information* \[ **R3**\] *is of good scientific quality and is based on state of the art methods \(as recommended by ICES WKMEDS\). Furthermore, the approach chosen to try to validate how representative the captive survival estimates were of the wider fleets is commendable.*’ \( **S4**\) 

 Following the independent assessment by STECF, the European Commission approved and published in October 2018 delegated regulations specifying details of the implementation of the landing obligation in the North Sea \( **S5**\) and in North\-Western waters \( **S6**\) for the period 2019\-2020, which included **a discards exemption based on high\-survival for **Nephrops** underpinned by **R3**. The link to our research \( **R3**\) informing the European Commission decision is here acknowledged by Marine Scotland: 

 ‘*without this data Marine Scotland would have been unable to demonstrate to the Regional Groups, EU Commission and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries \(STECF\) that returning the smaller Nephrops as per the derogation did not affect the mortality and the ‘de minimis’ exemptions that were in place at the time were no longer needed to enable fishers to continue activity and remain viable.*’ Policy officer, Marine Scotland \( **S7**\) 

 The impacts of research projects **R1** and **R3** were independently evaluated by researchers from Anderson Solutions Consulting and O’Herlihy & Co, who were commissioned by the projects’ funding body Fisheries Innovation Scotland \(FIS\). Results from this evaluation \( **S8**\) concluded that: 

 ‘*this research had moved out of the research phase and had been followed by action by government.’* \(FIS07, **R1** and FIS015, **R3**\) \( **S8**\) 

 Marine Scotland provided feedback to FIS regarding the impact that the FIS\-commissioned research had: 

 ‘*The research from FIS was a key component of the case that Marine Scotland put forward to argue for a High Survival exemption for Nephrops caught in trawls with a mesh size greater than 80mm in both the North Sea and North Western Waters. The FIS research formed the evidence base on which we were able to show than more that 50% of discarded Nephrops did survive and were capable of contributing to the overall biomass. The complete report from FIS was sent to STECF where it was reviewed. STECF assessed it as methodologically sound and its conclusions were considered convincing. Without the FIS research we would not have been able to secure the Nephrops high survival exemptions*.’ \( **S9**. Quote given in writing by Paul McCarthy, Policy officer, Marine Scotland to the Executive Director of Fisheries Innovation Scotland, Feb\-19\) 

 **Impact 2: Ensuring prawn fishing viability and reduction of costs** 

 As acknowledged by Marine Scotland in **S7**, the change in policy ‘ *enable fishers to continue activity and remain viable*’. The landing of small unmarketable animals had been identified by the industry as an economic burden. According to a study by the Centre of Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science \(Cefas\) from the UK government it was estimated that the average costs across the industry for disposing discards would be GBP9,900 per fishing vessel per year \(Mangi and Catchpole, 2014: doi.org/10.1017/S0376892913000532\). Costs could be higher for geographically remote landing ports such as the ones in the west of Scotland. Given that there are 164 *Nephrops* trawlers in the waters where this exemption applies, an estimated saving of GBP1,600,000 across the fleet was achieved in 2019. While it is impossible to accurately estimate savings made in 2020 because of disruption to the activities of the *Nephrops* fleet due to Covid\-19, this may have amounted to a further GBP1,600,000. This cost was highlighted as a key concern to the economic viability of the sector. For this reason, initially as the reformed CFP was being implemented, Marine Scotland applied for a ‘ *de minimis*’ exemption to the landing of discarded *Nephrops*. That allowed fishers to discard up to a maximum of 6% in 2018. This ‘ *de minimis*’ exemption was approved by the European Commission who agreed that increases in catch selectivity were very difficult to achieve in a short\-time frame and that there was supporting information on the disproportionate costs of handing the discarded catch \(Commission delegated regulation EU 2015/2438\). 

 **Impact 3: Law enforcement and security practices do not need to be changed** 

 Prior to the *Nephrops* discard exemption that relied on our evidence, the enforcement of the discard ban would have represented a challenge to both governments and industry. If discarded *Nephrops* were to be landed new enforcement strategies would have had to have been implemented. Evidence of this research leading to **avoidance of negative outcomes** is here acknowledged by a fisherman: 

 ‘*The derogation has been a keystone in maintaining our ability to continue fishing unhindered. \(…\)* 

 *The project has stopped the realistic possibility of a large financial burden for cameras and disposal of any catch. The mental burden of having to comply with unworkable burdens should not be underestimated*.’ \( **S10**. Quote from Mr Ian Wightman, Fisherman from the Clyde Fishermen’s Association\) 

 And, also by Marine Scotland: 

 ‘*The granting of this derogation was particularly useful for all those involved. By combining the derogations into one it made things simpler for stakeholders to follow and comply with, reducing the possibility of enforcement action and any confusion as to which derogation was being utilised at the time of inspection. The simplification also benefitted policy colleagues as it made negotiations simpler by referring to one exemption*.’ \( **S7**. Policy officer, Marine Scotland\) 

 **Impact 4: Natural resource\-use efficiency** 

 Although the main objective of the 2014 reformed EU CFP is the exploitation of living marine biological resources at levels that contribute to long\-term sustainable environmental conditions, landing organisms that show high survivability makes no conservation sense because landing those individuals would increase overall mortality rates. The approved discard ban exemption based on high survival means that >50% of *Nephrops* now being returned at sea are contributing to current stocks **improving their sustainability**. According to our research \( **R3**\), on average around 800 *Nephrops* are discarded per trawl. On average, each vessel conducts 4 trawls per day and given the fact that there are around 164 *Nephrops* vessels in the area this exemption applies operating 200 days/year, this translates into around 105,000,000 *Nephrops* being returned at sea every year due to this change in policy. Animals that otherwise would have been landed and killed due the landing obligation policy.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Operas *The Devil Inside* \(2016\) and *Anthropocene* \(2019\) – Louise Welsh \(librettist\) collaborating with Stuart MacRae \(composer\) – together mark a significant contribution to the artform, characterised by increasing complexity of voices, narrative and themes. These works attracted substantial investment from Scottish Opera, whose productions have demonstrated, through their scope and scale, the importance of Welsh’s contribution in modernising the genre. The significance of this is shown by a film of *Anthropocene* being streamed in 2019 and 2020 via  [OperaVision](https://operavision.eu/en/library/performances/flashback/anthropocene-scottish-opera) and attracting 8,000\+ views and a re\-staging of *Anthropocene* – *Anthropozän* – at the Salzburg Landestheater in May 2021 \(delayed from 2020 due to Covid\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Since Louise Welsh’s award\-winning debut novel, *The Cutting Room* \(2002\), her work has engaged with complex issues, focusing on the ways in which social structures can underpin or undermine the human experience. This creative practice research investigates how narratives can be employed to reflect and impact on civil society in various genres, including novels, public art, creative non\-fiction, radio features and opera. Welsh’s critically acclaimed *Plague Times* trilogy \[3.3, 3.4\], located during a contemporary pandemic, explores a variety of human responses to the removal of established social norms and structures. Like her most recent opera *Anthropocene*, the trilogy explores fundamental moral questions such as the importance of individual survival set against the survival of the wider population. 

 The opera *Anthropocene* was developed and written between 2015−2018, during which time the concept of the ‘Anthropocene’ has evolved from obscure scientific term to a recognised part of popular discourse. *The Devil Inside* and *Anthropocene* draw on gothic tropes and literature. In addition to science and modern themes such as climate change, *Anthropocene* draws on Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s images of Frankenstein’s creature abandoned on the ice, whilst *The Devil Inside* is inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson’s South Seas tale, *The Bottle Imp*. For *Anthropocene*, Welsh engaged with scientific literature and discourse on climate change, to better incorporate resonant contemporary themes into the genre. 

 Welsh and MacRae have developed the artform of opera through breaking with some of its traditional conventions. Their singers often converse, rather than declaim. Female characters have agency within their operas – still a revolutionary act in a genre whose best\-loved classics such as *Tosca*, *Rigoletto*, *La Traviata*, *Carmen*, and *La Bohème* culminate in the death of the heroine. In *Anthropocene* there is gender parity amongst the cast, and there are women as well as men in formal leadership roles \(e.g. Professor Prentice, the expedition leader, is female\), which means that female singers are asked to use their voices in ways that are non\-traditional to the form. The powerful female duets and arias, and Welsh and MacRae’s choice of contemporary themes and subject matter <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02D;</span>a couple of elderly serial killers, PTSD, addiction, Anthropocene <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02D;</span>present a challenge to critics and audiences that is refreshing to the form. 

 Opera has a reputation in the UK for being ‘high\-brow’ and inaccessible to new audiences, especially younger people. Expanding the canon and responding to contemporary global concerns that appeal to younger audiences are essential for opera to have relevancy, and to continue to develop and thrive as an artform. Welsh and MacRae’s ten\-year practice and collaborative creative output, with its focus on contemporary themes and commitment to pushing form and content, has made a significant and distinctive contribution to contemporary opera.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The ground\-breaking opera *The Devil Inside,* co\-produced by Scottish Opera and Music Theatre Wales, toured widely in 2016, reaching a range of audiences in the UK \[5.1\]. *The Devil Inside* attracted audiences of 1,194 at Glasgow’s Theatre Royal, 963 at Edinburgh’s King’s Theatre and 262 at London’s Hackney Empire, totalling 2,419. Its tour also attracted audiences of 1,088 across an additional eight Welsh and English venues, with the strongest sales being in Scotland partly attributed by the Director of Scottish Opera to the ‘ *prominence of the two Scottish creatives*’, i.e. the growing reputation of Welsh and MacRae in Scotland at the time \[5.2\].

 Unusually for a contemporary opera, *The Devil Inside* was universally well\-received \(4 or 5 stars\) by critics. For example, the  [Glasgow Herald](https://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/14226669.Opera_review__The_Devil_Inside_at_Theatre_Royal__Glasgow/) noted that ‘ *Welsh's bold stroke is to update the tale to the present with all the obsessions and vices of contemporary society’*.  [The Observer](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/31/the-devil-inside-stuart-macrae-review-louise-welsh-lost-and-found-emily-hall) described it as ‘ *intimate, intense and unsettling’*.  [The Herald](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14242601.souls-in-peril-opera-review-of-the-devil-inside/) commented that ‘ *this operatic translation of Stevenson's Faustian tale feels like a work that was waiting to be written’*.  [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opera/what-to-see/the-devil-inside-music-theatre-walesscottish-opera-peacock-theat/) found it ‘ *refreshing to find a new opera that trusts in traditional story\-telling and doesn’t attempt to sell itself by spurious gimmickry*.’ The opera was performed in Canada with performances with Tapestry Opera, Toronto at Harbourfront Theatre, and was broadcast on BBC radio 3 which attracts a weekly  [audience of \~2m](https://media.info/radio/stations/bbc-radio-3/listening-figures). It was shortlisted for several awards \[5.3\]: 

-  Sunday Herald Culture Awards \(musical artist category, 2016\) 

-  Scottish New Music Award Finalist \(Large Scale Work, 2017\) 

-  UK Theatre Award in Achievement \(opera category, 2016\) 

-  Scottish Cultural Award \(2016\) 

 Scottish Opera is Scotland’s national opera company, one of only five in the UK, and enjoys international renown. Scottish Opera’s director explained that ‘ *the success of \[The Devil Inside\] led us to finally commission* Anthropocene *with full orchestra and 8 principal singers’.* \[5.4\] 

 *Anthropocene* was in fact the first new full\-length opera to be commissioned by Scottish Opera in 17 years \[5.4\]. The Director noted that this subsequent collaboration brought ‘ *a more substantial timeframe, larger creative ambitions \(e.g. scale, more characters, larger orchestra\) and more complex interactions at a musical and a narrative level’*. The budget of an opera company to commission new work is limited, so Scottish Opera’s investment in Welsh and MacRae for increasingly larger\-scale operas shows their confidence in the duo’s success in pushing the boundaries of the artform, as well as their critical and popular reception. The Scottish Opera Director \[5.4\] commented: ‘ *our significant investment in the Welsh/MacRae creative partnership … illustrates our commitment to creating and presenting new work in order to keep our artform vibrant, healthy and relevant’,* adding that each new opera *‘strengthens the sector by building an appetite for new work amongst audiences and developing opera as a contemporary artform.’*

 *Anthropocene* premiered in January 2019, and because of its larger scale, its potential for touring was more limited than *The Devil Inside*. However, it attracted even higher numbers than *The Devil Inside*: 1,851 at Glasgow’s Theatre Royal; 1,646 at Edinburgh’s King’s Theatre; and 1,329 at London’s Hackney Empire, totalling 4,826 \[5.2\]. Theatre Royal performances sold out, audiences in Edinburgh and Hackney came close to selling out, and the Kings Theatre opened the gods to accommodate overspill. The Director of Scottish Opera also remarked \[5.4\] that *‘under 26s made up 13% of our audience – higher than the 8.1% average for that season’*. The strong numbers attending the Hackney Empire, which does not normally host contemporary opera, also suggest diversity of audiences. 

 *Anthropocene* was also critically well\-received; for example,  [Opera Now](https://www.rhinegold.co.uk/opera_now/scottish-opera-anthropocene/) described it as ‘ *tense and riveting … embodies the spirit of good 21st\-century opera'*,  [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/review-anthropocene-at-theatre-royal-glasgow-6v8s08fvd) as *'gripping music theatre'*, and  [Sunday Herald](https://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/17405403.opera-theatre-by-mark-brown/) as ‘ *worthy of Euripides or Aeschylus’*.  [TLS](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/when-the-ice-breaks/) \(The Times Literary Supplement\) also noted that: ‘ *Welsh’s thriller\-writing experience is evident in the way fault lines in each character … are carefully delineated and employed in driving the drama*…’ \[5.5\]. Audiences also  [responded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=2hijkLiueCM) extremely positively, for example describing it as intriguing, gripping, shocking and enjoyable. 

 *Anthropocene’s* influence has far outlasted its run. Between March−November 2019, the OperaVision website platformed films of four selected European contemporary operas. *Anthropocene* attracted over 44,000 views before it ended on 5<sup>th</sup> Jan 2020, the second highest viewing figures after *Frankenstein*, an adaptation from a well\-known work, as well as over 88 likes and 292 shares \[5.6\]. At the end of its run, OperaVision asked to extend *Anthropocene*’s showing into 2020 due to popular demand \[5.7\]. In May 2020,  [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/16/classical-music-opera-livestream-at-home-coronavirus) included *Anthropocene* in its lockdown cultural highlights and in July, BBC Radio 3’s  [Sarah Walker](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hvn6) featured the opera in her arts round\-up as one of five spotlighted cultural events. 

 Restagings and new productions of contemporary operas are extremely unusual, but relatively traditional Salzburg State Opera commissioned a  [new production of *Anthropocene*](https://www.salzburger-landestheater.at/en/produktionen/anthropozaen.html?m=261) originally scheduled for 2020. Rescheduled due to Covid\-19, it will now premiere in May 2021, a major step towards the opera’s integration within an emerging international canon of contemporary opera. It is now available on  [Amazon Prime USA](https://www.amazon.com/Anthropocene-Opera-Harrison-Hutchinson/dp/B07VV6W4KV). *Anthropocene* has also been shortlisted by the  [International Opera Awards](http://www.operaawards.org/archive/2020/) in the World Premiere Category, alongside Deutsche Opera Berlin, Opera Australia, National Theatre Tokyo and others, and it won Large Scale New Work at the 2020  [Scottish Awards for New Music](https://newmusicscotland.co.uk/awards2020/). Finally, further underlining the impact of these operas, from September 2020 Creative Scotland funded MacRae and Welsh to work towards developing a new opera \[5.10\], a mark of confidence in a sector profoundly affected by the pandemic.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Questions about the nature of morality, truth, and science are of huge importance to audiences across the world, but differences in educational opportunity mean that not everyone can engage with these questions in a critical manner. Research spanning the Philosophy department led to the creation of 2 Massive Open Online Courses \(MOOCs\): *Introduction to Philosophy* and *Philosophy and the Sciences*. 

 These MOOCs **improved access to current philosophical ideas** for diverse learners \(568,392 enrolments from 184 sovereign states\); **changed learners’ perspectives and goals**; **increased learners’ understanding** of philosophical research at Edinburgh; changed **teaching resources** in a range of international settings \(50,108 non\-HEI teachers used, or planned to use, the MOOCs for education purposes\); and **informed other online learning initiatives** globally, e.g. the University of North Carolina \(USA\) and KU Leuven \(Netherlands\) were inspired to launch their own Philosophy MOOCs. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Research from across Edinburgh Philosophy formed the basis of the MOOCs. 11 academic staff members were filmed, and MOOC content drew on research of at least 12 further staff members. Underpinning research for the MOOCs was consequently extremely broad, including at least 67 journal articles, 40 book chapters, and 18 monographs. 

 The following 6 MOOC topics \(out of 17\) provide a sample of how individual MOOC topics were underpinned by research outputs \(associated research funding for these outputs was GBP1.9 million\). A full picture of the underlying research base for the MOOCs was outlined for learners on the “@Edinburgh” webpages of the MOOCs. 

  

1.  “Morality: Objective, Relative or Emotive?” \( *Introduction*, topic 2\): **Matthew Chrisman** argues that the three main approaches to morality – objectivism, relativism, and emotivism – are not rivals and can be synthesised in a unified treatment, a view he explores in his monograph, *The Meaning of ‘Ought’* \[3.1\]. 

1.  “What is Knowledge? And Do We Have Any?” \( *Introduction*, topic 3\): **Duncan Pritchard** argues for an approach to knowledge he calls “anti\-luck epistemology” – knowledge must involve both an “anti\-luck” and an “ability” condition, a position he defends in his article, “Anti\-luck virtue epistemology” \[3.2\]. 

1.  “Should You Believe What You Hear?” \( *Introduction*, topic 5\): **Allan Hazlett** argues in the context of the debate between Hume and Reid on testimony that intellectual autonomy is valuable, not only for individualistic reasons, but also because it would bring broader socio\-political benefits, a view he defends in his article, “The social value of non\-deferential belief” \[3.3\]. 

1.  “Time Travel and Philosophy” \( *Introduction*, topic 9\): **Alistair Richmond** argues that special and general relativity are consistent with a sentient agent having a finitely long personal life that extends infinitely far into the past and future, a view he defends in his article, “On behalf of spore gods” \[3.4\]. 

1.  “Dark Matter and Dark Energy” \( *Sciences*, topic 3\): **Michela Massimi** argues that discrepancies in current models of galaxy formation can be remedied either by adding new entities \(dark matter/energy\), or by modifying the underlying theory \(Newtonian gravity\). She explains how this is an example of underdetermination of theory by evidence in her article, “Three problems about multi\-scale modelling in cosmology” \[3.5\]. 

1.  “Embodied Cognition” \( *Sciences*, topic 4\): **Andy Clark** argues that cognition is not always a brain\-based process. Our cognitive processes sometimes recruit mechanisms in our body and external environment, a position he defends in his monograph, *Supersizing the Mind* \[3.6\]. 

 No prior knowledge of philosophy among learners was assumed. The aim was to introduce underpinning research in a way that would be accessible, engaging, and clear to new audiences. Links between specific journal articles/monographs and MOOC content were forged for learners in three ways: 

  

1.  Key findings from research outputs were discussed directly by authors in their MOOC videos, after introducing them via motivating questions and the surrounding context. 

1.  “@Edinburgh” webpages for each MOOC topic provided a lay description of the Edinburgh research underpinning the topic and a summary of the key research findings, relevant publications, and hyperlinks to open\-access research \(approximately 1,000 words per MOOC topic; 17,000 words in total\). 

1.  A textbook accompanied each MOOC. Each chapter was written by the staff member who taught the MOOC topic and aimed to help bridge gaps in understanding between their research and expected learner’s knowledge \(approximately 6,000 word chapters for each MOOC topic\).

##  4. Details of the impact 

 *Introduction to Philosophy* was launched in spring 2013 as one of the first UK MOOCs. *Philosophy and the Sciences* launched in October 2014. In 2016, *Sciences* was split into two “mini” MOOCs focussed on the *Physical* and *Cognitive* sciences respectively. All of the MOOCs were free for learners to take. 

###  Engaging new audiences with philosophy 

 The MOOCs **enabled** **learners from diverse backgrounds to access philosophy**, many for the first time. Between August 2013 and August 2019, there were 326,598 enrolments for *Introduction*, and 128,938 enrolments for the *Sciences* courses \[5.1, pp. 11, 12\], with the learners being drawn from 184 out of 195 sovereign states as recognised by the UN \[5.1, p. 33\]. 

 25% of *Introduction* learners, and 21% of *Sciences* learners, did not have a university degree \(142,099 people\) \[5.1, p. 16\]. In a survey of course alumni \(629 respondents\), 54% of *Introduction* learners, and 25% *Sciences* learners, said the course was their first encounter with academic philosophy \[5.1, p. 3\]. 

 37% of learners came from outside Europe and North America, and 52% of learners did not have English as their first language \[5.1\]. Learners voluntarily posted transcripts of course videos and translated them into 16 languages. In 2016, a full Chinese\-language version of *Introduction* was created by the hosting platform \(Coursera\) in response to demand from China, generating 13,015 enrolments between 2016 and 2018 \[5.2\]. 

 The reach of these courses is unusual in the humanities. In 2017, *Introduction* was ranked the 17th all\-time most popular MOOC across all subject areas and all providers. Only 9 humanities MOOCs made this global top\-50 list, including only 1 other philosophy MOOC \( *Introduction* was the higher ranked of the two\) \[5.3\]. Alongside the British Council, Edinburgh \(with *Introduction*\) was the only non\-US MOOC provider listed inside the top 50. Within the UK, *Introduction* was ranked 7th and *Sciences* ranked 20th most popular MOOC by enrolment in 2016; they were also the only philosophy courses that made this list \[5.4\]. 

 Compared to more formal educational approaches, completion rates tend to be lower in the MOOCs sector. According to FutureLearn \(the UK’s largest MOOC provider\), 7% of learners who begin one of their courses complete it. Completion figures are comparable for *Introduction* \(6% completion rate\), and markedly higher for *Sciences* \(17% average completion rate\) \[5.1, p. 14\]. 

 The MOOCs **increased understanding of the underpinning Edinburgh research**. 88% of learners testified that it was “valuable” to hear about contemporary Edinburgh research \[5.1, p. 21\]. Learner Stories \(free\-text feedback collected by Coursera\) include references to how the courses “changed my perspective on algorithms, computers, and human mind” \( *Cognitive Sciences*\) *,* and being “totally absorbed by debates on the very nature of scientific knowledge” \( *Physical Sciences*\). From the overall positive reception of the MOOCs, it was evident that the focus on contemporary research, rather than a simple historical overview, was appreciated by learners, for example: 

 “What I particularly liked about the course \[…\] was the fact that the material was very up\-to\-date.” \[5.1, p. 23\] 

 Learners reported that the courses “improved their understanding” of specific Edinburgh research outputs. For example, with respect to the research outputs \[3.1\]–\[3.6\], 74%, 79%, 65%, 49%, 72%, 65% of learners agreed with that statement respectively \[5.1, p. 21\]. 

 The MOOCs **inspired learners to engage further with philosophy**. 87% of learners said they had undertaken further reading or study of philosophy because of the MOOCs \[5.1, p. 19\]. The optional accompanying textbooks sold 6,100 copies \(December 2017\) \[5.5\]. Feedback from Learner Stories describes learners advancing to read source texts, such as this *Introduction* student, reading Pritchard’s monograph on epistemology: 

 “I am just reading *What is \[this\] Thing Called Knowledge* \- not easy but interesting.” \[5.1, p. 18\] 

 Others cited the MOOCs in their decision to study philosophy: 

 “I have been out of education for over 15 years and this has encouraged me to enrol in further philosophy courses.” \[5.1, p. 19\] 

 The MOOCs also **changed learners’ wider perspectives**. 77% of learners said the courses changed the way they think about the world \[5.1, p. 3\]. The courses acted “like a door to open a new world of perspectives”, or enabled participants to “learn the necessary skills \[…\] to become a better thinker in this digital age” \[5.1, p. 24\]: 

 “I learnt that it is in fact okay to question EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING. I am now able to approach and appreciate all subject matter in a way that I would have never been able to before.” \[5.1, p. 24\] 

###  Impact on educational practice 

 The MOOCs **changed teaching resources and delivery**. 10% of learners \(50,108 people\) were education practitioners. In a survey, 21% confirmed that they had or planned to use the MOOCs for education purposes \[5.1, p. 28\]: 

 “I took the course because I am a Philosophy teacher in High school and I wanted to improve as an individual. Everything about the course was just perfect.” \[5.1, p. 27\] 

 Teachers reported using MOOCs for lesson planning, materials, and leadership teaching. One learner notes that the section on embodied cognition will help “in my job in the education sector, particularly in our current thinking about meta\-cognition and self\-talk” \[5.1, p. 27\]. MOOCs were used to bolster teaching provision in existing philosophy courses: exploring points further, supporting reading groups, or as pre\-course watching for A\-Level Philosophy \[5.1, p. 28\]. 

 The MOOCs influenced teaching internationally: *Introduction* is a pre\-requisite for the Bachelor of Elementary Education in Mindano State University, Philippines; *Cognitive Sciences* is recommended for students at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics; and *Physical Sciences* has helped teachers deliver science material on the IB diploma \[5.1, pp. 26–27\]. A high\-school teacher in Mexico reported that *Introduction* allowed him to offer his pupils “better content” and showcase new areas of philosophy to which they did not previously have access \[5.1, p. 27\]. In 2014, the MOOC videos were released on the University of Edinburgh’s Open Education YouTube channel \(4,430 channel subscribers; more than 120,000 views for *Introduction* and *Sciences* MOOC videos as of December 2020\). The videos were released under a Creative Commons license, which allows teachers and pupils around the world to freely view, use, and adapt the course videos without permission or enrolment on the MOOCs \[5.6\]. 

###  Impact on online learning initiatives 

 The MOOCs **informed other online learning initiatives** by showing that online learning in the humanities could reach a large, diverse, and global audience \[5.7\]. According to Coursera, the platform that hosted the MOOCs, the success of *Introduction* “opened and pioneered the way for other humanities MOOCs to even be written” \[5.8\]. As of February 2020, the Coursera platform hosts nearly 750 courses relating to philosophy. 

 In Edinburgh, the MOOCs **directly led to the creation of two new online Masters degrees** in philosophy \(MSc Epistemology, Ethics and Mind; and MSc Philosophy, Science and Religion, which from 2014–15 to 2019–20 \(inclusive\) attracted 413 students, and generated GBP1,954,000 in income\), as well as three further MOOCs which drew on content from researchers at other HEIs \( *Philosophy, Science and Religion*; *Intellectual Humility*; *Know Thyself –* total 30,555 learners\) \[5.7, 5.9\]. 

 The MOOCs also helped **convince other HEIs of the benefits and feasibility of online learning in Philosophy** at both MOOC and degree level. For example, the University of North Carolina \(USA\) and KU Leuven \(Netherlands\), were both inspired by Edinburgh’s example to launch their own Philosophy MOOCs, while Birkbeck, University of London, notes that “Edinburgh’s Coursera course *Introduction to Philosophy* helped convince us of the effectiveness of well\-produced video lectures” \[5.10\].

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Queen Mary’s follow up results of the IBIS\-I trial, published in 2007 and 2015, demonstrated that for women at increased breast cancer risk, taking tamoxifen for five years has a 20\-year preventive effect. Thus, since August 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force, the American Cancer Society, and the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network have recommended prophylactic tamoxifen for women at increased breast cancer risk, numbering over 7,000,000. In Australia, tamoxifen was licenced for breast cancer prevention in 2016, and was added to the Australian Government’s pharmaceutical benefits scheme, as a result of which an estimated 250,000 women will directly benefit. In April 2018, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency approved the use of tamoxifen in the primary prevention of breast cancer in women at moderate or high risk. In England and Wales this amounts to approximately 500,000 women. A five\-year preventive treatment course of tamoxifen costs approximately GBP130. By contrast, the treatment for breast cancer per patient can cost GBP12,000 per year.

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As the incidence of breast cancer continues to rise \(an estimated 1,600,000 cases now occur worldwide each year\), research is focussing on prevention for women at increased risk. Prior to 2002, several studies of the prophylactic utility of the selective oestrogen receptor modulator \(SERM\) drug, tamoxifen, had produced mixed results, and opinion was divided on the risk to benefit ratio. In the two follow up studies to the Queen Mary led the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study \(IBIS\-I\) trial, published in 2007 and 2015, Prof. Cuzick, as lead investigator in the IBIS\-I, demonstrated that for women at increased risk, tamoxifen taken for five years has a continuing preventive effect for 20 years. 

 In the original IBIS\-I double\-blind randomised placebo controlled trial of tamoxifen, 7,154 women considered to be at increased risk of breast cancer were allocated to five years of either tamoxifen, or placebo. The first published results in 2002 showed that after a median follow\-up of 50 months, there was an observed 32% risk reduction, but the overall risk to benefit ratio remained unclear. At median eight years of follow\-up, the long term results reported in 2007 \[3.1\] showed that the risk reducing effects of tamoxifen appeared to persist for at least ten years. This study also presented the first randomised evidence that while the benefits of tamoxifen extend beyond the treatment period, the side effects largely did not. 

 A 2013 meta\-analysis of all SERM prevention trials \[3.2\] confirmed the preventive efficacy of these drugs. In the extended long term IBIS\-I follow up \(median 16 years\) published in 2015 \[3.3\], it was found that the preventive effect of five years of tamoxifen treatment remained similar, and persisted, throughout the 20\-year period. Reductions were recorded for invasive oestrogen receptor positive cancers and ductal carcinoma in situ, but not for invasive oestrogen receptor negative cases. Tamoxifen was shown to offer a very long period of protection after treatment cessation, and therefore the benefit to harm ratio of tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention was substantially improved. 

 Cuzick and his team have subsequently published additional research on tamoxifen in breast cancer prevention, including: 

-  An assessment of uptake \[3.4\] 

-  A comparison of results with a second trial to help identify more women who would benefit from the treatment and to investigate the effect of  adding a polygenic risk score to refine the risk models \[3.5\] 

-  And a study of attitudes among general practitioners to prescribing tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention and the potential benefit of initiating prescriptions for preventive therapy in secondary rather than primary care \[3.6\]. 

 Thus, Queen Mary’s research has demonstrated that for women at increased breast cancer risk, taking tamoxifen for five years has a 20\-year preventive effect and that tamoxifen should, therefore, be considered for long\-term preventive treatment.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Queen Mary’s research has enabled access to tamoxifen as a long\-term preventive treatment for breast cancer for women at increased risk. This has been achieved through influencing international clinical guidelines and providing evidence that has facilitated approval for this new use of tamoxifen. 

  

#  Informing clinical guidelines in the US 

 Over 7,000,000 women in the US \(approximately 10% of the female population aged 35 or older\) fall into the ‘high risk’ category for breast cancer. Using tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer among women aged 55 and younger with a 5\-year risk of ≥1.66% will prevent 29 cases and 9 breast cancer deaths, and save USD47,580 per 1,000 women treated \[5.1\]. 

 Recommendations regarding tamoxifen for preventive use changed after publication of the IBIS\-I long term follow up results \[3.1, 3.2\]. The US Preventive Services Task Force, in September 2013, reviewed IBIS\-I \[3.1\] as part of the evidence for offering risk reducing SERMs such as tamoxifen and recommended offering them to asymptomatic women aged 35 or older without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or lobular carcinoma in situ, but who are at increased risk of breast cancer \[5.2\]. The American Cancer Society also altered its guidelines, referencing \[3.2\] to note that tamoxifen has been shown to lower breast cancer risk \[5.3\]. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network \(NCCN\) guidelines of 2017 referenced Prof. Cuzick’s work on chemoprevention \[3.2\] and recommend that women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be evaluated for preventive treatment \[5.4\]. The NCCN used Cuzick’s work \[3.1, 3.3\] as part of the evidence base for their recommendation that tamoxifen is used as an option for pre\- and post\-menopausal women aged 35 or older with a life expectancy of 10 years or more, who are at increased risk for breast cancer \(generally those with ≥1.7% 5\-year risk for breast cancer using the Gail model\) \[5.5\]. 

#  Informing clinical guidelines in Australia 

 Based on the IBIS\-I and other clinical trials, in April 2016, Nolvadex \[5.6\] \(tamoxifen\) was approved with an “extension of indication” by the Australian Government’s Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration. It announced that Nolvadex was now indicated for the primary reduction of breast cancer risk in women either at moderately increased risk \(lifetime breast cancer risk 1.5 to 3 times the population average\) or high risk \(lifetime breast cancer risk greater than 3 times the population average\) \[5.7\]. Tamoxifen for women at increased risk of breast cancer was then added to the Australian Government’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme \(PBS\) \[5.8\]. The National Breast Cancer Foundation’s press coverage of this development noted that this change in policy was a result of the IBIS\-I trial evidence, which it was “proud” to have funded \[5.9\]. 

 With the approval of tamoxifen as a preventive measure on PBS, an estimated 250,000 women with a family history or a genetic predisposition to breast cancer will benefit. Australian women deemed at moderate\-to\-high high risk of developing breast cancer have access to subsidised tamoxifen \(AUD36 per script\) to reduce their lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, which will, in turn, reduce costs to the health system \[5.9\]. 

#  Facilitating approval for preventive use of tamoxifen in the UK 

 In April 2018, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency approved the use of tamoxifen in the primary prevention of breast cancer in women at moderate or high risk in the UK and the Cuzick team’s meta\-analysis and IBIS\-I papers \[3.1\-3.3\] were the “pivotal” publications for the clinical efficacy conclusions made \[5.10\]. 

 In the UK, around 3.7% of the female population aged 35\-74 have a moderate or high risk \[5.11\]. In England and Wales this is around 500,000 women. A five\-year preventive treatment course of tamoxifen costs about GBP130. By contrast, the treatment of breast cancer per patient can cost GBP12,000 per year \[5.12\]. 

 The NHS Accelerated Access Collaborative has named tamoxifen, as a provision to women at risk of developing breast cancer, as one of four new innovations to be addressed in its 2020\-21 Rapid Uptake Product Programme. The programme supports stronger adoption and spread of proven innovations for products that support the key clinical priorities of the NHS Long Term Plan, and will work to improve patient care and outcomes by more effectively providing tamoxifen to women who are at risk \[5.13\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor David Wilkinson’s research into the human vestibular system has underpinned the development and clinical approval of the *ThermoNeuro Modulation Device,* a new non\-invasive treatment for neurological disease based on vestibular stimulation. In 2018, this device received both *de novo* regulatory approval for episodic migraine prevention from the Food and Drugs Administration \(FDA\) in the US and a CE mark as a medical device from the British Standards Institution \(BSl\) in the UK. The former enables the device to enter routine clinical use in the US, while the latter is an important milestone towards clinical approval in the UK. Later that year, the same device gained *Breakthrough Device* designation by the FDA for the clinical management of Parkinson’s disease.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This case study is based on a long\-standing programme of research by Professor David Wilkinson on the therapeutic value of non\-invasive vestibular stimulation, which provides a simple and effective means of altering the signals sent from the balance organs of the inner ear to the brain. This alteration can be achieved by applying low\-amplitude electric current to the part of the scalp behind the ears \(galvanic vestibular stimulation\) or by applying warm/cool thermal current to the external ear canal \(caloric vestibular stimulation\), which likewise changes the firing rates of the nearby vestibular nerve. These changes modulate metabolic activity and vascular flow in many cortical and subcortical areas of brain. 

 The programme evolved from initial single\-case and small group studies conducted with stroke participants presenting with acquired face blindness, constructional apraxia, aphasia, or hemi\-spatial neglect \(see 2014 case study\). Wilkinson’s research then progressed to larger clinical studies funded by the Medical Research Council **\[G1\]** with further studies supported by the British Academy, Harvard Catalyst, and the East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust. 

 In **2012**, Wilkinson began a collaboration with Scion Neurostim LLC **\[G2\]**, a US\-based medical device company that led to the development of the *ThermoNeuro Modulation Device*. This involved studies on the therapeutic potential of vestibular stimulation in migraine headache and Parkinson’s disease, both of which impose considerable unmet clinical needs. According to the American Headache Society, migraine is the third most common disease and the sixth most disabling health condition, affecting around 12% of the worldwide population. Patients often resist prophylactic therapy owing to unpleasant side effects, cost, and perceived low efficacy of the currently available medication. Meanwhile, one in 37 people will be diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease at some point in their life. The available medication typically declines in efficacy as the disease progresses and often leads to complications. Non\-motor symptoms often become the major determinant of quality of life and care\-giver burden. Each patient typically presents with multiple non\-motor symptoms, resulting in multiple prescriptions that can interact unexpectedly and are confusing to manage. 

 The research funded by Scion enabled Wilkinson et al. to show clinically relevant reductions in the number of migraine headache days, migraine pain, and use of over\-the\-counter migraine abortive medications in 81 volunteers suffering from 4\-14 migraines per month and recruited from headache centres across the UK and US **\[R2\]**. In Parkinson’s disease, following a successful single\-case study that established proof of concept, Wilkinson designed and led the definitive clinical trial designed to meet regulatory approval. The results showed compelling reductions in motor \(including reduced rigidity, freezing, and tremor\) and non\-motor \(including better memory, sleep, and less depression and anxiety\) features **\[R1\]**. These exceeded the minimal clinically important difference in 87% \(14 of the 16\) individuals who received active, as opposed to placebo, stimulation and completed the full treatment. Effects were present at one\-month follow\-up and still partially visible at six months, indicative of long\-term plastic change, which is unusual for a neurological treatment **\[R2, R4\]**. 

 Publications arising from these studies provide the direct clinical evidence base required for the regulatory approvals described in Section 4 **\[b, c\]**. Many of the publications are co\-authored with collaborators from Scion Neurostim LLC and UK clinicians.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This case study details how the *ThermoNeuro Modulation Device*, a novel non\-invasive device for treating migraine and Parkinson’s disease, gained regulatory approval for clinical use in the US \( **26/3/2018**\) and a CE mark in the UK \( **7/8/2018**\), as well as how the underpinning research also helped develop new generations of the device itself. All the activity detailed below results from a partnership between Wilkinson and the US medical device company, Scion Neurostim LLC, and continues a 2014 case study with activity from **1/8/2013** onwards. 

 The outstanding impact to date from this collaboration is regulatory approval for the device in the US for the treatment of episodic migraine. In **2018**, the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) issued a *de novo* classification of the *ThermoNeuro Modulation Device* developed by Scion Neurostim LLC as a ‘prophylactic treatment of episodic migraine in adolescent and adult patients 12 years or older’ **\[a\]**. The award of *de novo* status allows for clinical use and reimbursement codes to be generated by healthcare providers. The application for this approval **\[b\]** names Wilkinson as an investigator and cites five of his studies between 2005 and 2016 \(including **\[R3\]**\). 

 Also in **2018**, the FDA subsequently awarded the same device *Breakthrough* status for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease **\[c\]**. The application **\[d\]** draws exclusively on the safety and efficacy data generated by Wilkinson’s group **\[ R1, R2, R3, R4\]**. The *Breakthrough* designation is assigned by the FDA to devices that are deemed to address serious diseases with unmet needs. This ensures easier access to FDA staff and a reduced timeline for final device clearance for in\-clinic use. 

 As a result of these approvals, the following stages are now underway at Scion, as confirmed by Dr Robert Black, Chief Operating Officer of Scion Neurostim LLC **\[e\]**: 

-  Discussions have taken place with CMS \(Medicare & Medicaid\) and the FDA about the further Parkinson’s disease studies required for full FDA approval, to make sure that expectations for eventual product reimbursement by CMS are met. 

-  Preparations for commercialisation in the durable medical equipment \(DME\) category and ongoing discussions with medical device and pharmaceutical companies on marketing the device. 

-  Raising external capital \(for the first time in Scion’s history\) with commitment now in place from a lead investor that manages a multibillion\-dollar endowment and has now completed due diligence. Further early follow\-on investors have taken the project 50% to the investment target for full rollout of the device. 

 Scion Neurostim also received a CE mark for its devices in **2018** from the British Standards Institution \(BSI\), in respect to ‘the design and manufacture of a caloric vestibular system stimulator device for the prevention of episodic migraine in adults’ **\[f\]**. A submission for this device is now in preparation for the UK Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. 

 As with all CE submissions, one of the key elements in preparing the portfolio was the conduct of Usability studies. As the original application shows, Wilkinson’s lab made a major contribution to this aspect of the submission **\[g\]**. This is based on practical\-use scenario protocols aimed at the target patient populations, in particular the design of the earpiece and the simplification of the control panel implemented in the Gen 4.0 version. Wilkinson is named as an investigator in the application, which includes one of his published studies **\[R2\]** in the Final Clinical Report. 

 Scion Neurostim LLC’s Chief Operating Officer confirms: 

 ‘Our new neuromodulation device has been completely redesigned to improve reliability and robustness and to simplify operation. Based largely on the feedback from PD subjects in Dr. Wilkinson’s pilot study, the control interfaces were reworked to make it easier for PD patients to operate the device’ **\[e\]**. 

 The latest technical development of the *ThermoNeuro Modulation Device* also benefits from Wilkinson’s input, based on his long history of galvanic vestibular stimulation research \(see section 2\). This played a significant role in Scion’s decision to add an electrical \(galvanic\) stimulator to the existing thermal device, which delivers the modulation signal without the need for skin electrodes, preparation, and gels. The Chief Operating Officer adds: 

 ‘Our plan is to work with Dr. Wilkinson on the development and testing of a GVS device that works through the same headset\-based Gen 4 platform. This new GVS device is designed with home\-use in mind, which enables an expanded approach to clinical applications of GVS, beyond the laboratory’ **\[e\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 An innovative collaboration with theatre\-makers drawing on research on theatre censorship in Spain, with a specific focus on the most frequently staged and studied modern Spanish play, Lorca’s *La casa de Bernarda Alba* \( *The House of Bernarda Alba*, a set text for Spanish A\-level\). The focus on censorship influenced the way in which the Spanish Theatre Company’s London production of the play was conceived and marketed, and expanded its impact on audiences by informing the educational materials made available to approximately 180 schools and shaping the post\-show discussions for school groups. Lorca’s masterpiece was also the subject of workshops involving 81 A\-level Spanish students, created in collaboration with Théâtre Sans Frontières. Research findings were turned into drama\-based activities integrating language learning, textual interpretation and contextual knowledge, transforming students’ and teachers’ approaches to the work. The project has changed partner organisations’ working methods and modified the way teachers work on *The House of Bernarda Alba* with A\-level students, helping them to develop a wider range of interpretations of the text and understand its relevance to the historical topics on the syllabus. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 This case study grew out of a collaborative research project funded by the AHRC between 2008 and 2011: Theatre Censorship in Spain, 1931\-1985 \(TCS\). Thompson was Principal Investigator, working with Catherine O’Leary of NUI Maynooth as Project Partner and Diego Santos Sánchez as Research Associate. Project website: <ins>www.dur.ac.uk/mlac/tcs</ins>. 

 The team’s outputs are making a significant and original contribution to understanding theatre censorship in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, reframing the field by comparing the Franco period to the Republic and civil war periods, by covering an unusually wide range of theatrical genres, and by paying close attention to Catalan theatre \(especially in output R1\). Since 2008, Thompson has given seven public lectures at schools, universities and theatres focusing on the censorship of Lorca and *La casa de Bernarda Alba*. Written in 1936 shortly before the start of the Spanish civil war and the murder of its author, the play was banned in Spain until 1963, because of the Franco regime’s hostility to the author and because of the intensity of the passions evoked in the work. 

 The *Hispanic Research Journal* article \(R4 below\) offers a survey of the field covered by the project, sets out the research questions, and anticipates some preliminary findings. Two of the key points it makes refer to Federico García Lorca, showing that he was an exception in being completely blacklisted by the Franco dictatorship, and that the case of *The House of Bernarda Alba* exemplifies a significant shift of power within the regime in the early 1960s. The story of the play’s prohibition from 1939 to 1963, including new evidence of the regime’s enduring unease about Lorca’s influence and censors’ arguments over the threat posed by the play, yields illuminating insights into the cultural history of the period, as well as opening up new ways of reading the text and understanding the political and cultural significance of Lorca’s work as a whole. 

 The project’s largest output to date is the edited volume *Global Insights on Theatre Censorship* \(R2\) based on contributions to the conference TCS ran as part of the Dublin Theatre Festival in 2010. The conference and the book expanded the scope and academic impact of TCS’s investigations, creating an opportunity to compare Spanish censorship with systems of cultural control in other countries. The keynote contributors were prominent theatre practitioners, whose accounts of combatting censorship in various forms were complemented by academic papers on historical and current examples from various countries. Output R3 broadens the scope of the research in a different way, using examples of censorship to reframe semiotic concepts of dramatic character. 

 The culminating output of the project will be a co\-authored monograph to be published in 2021, the first on this topic in English. The book will provide a comprehensive account of how the censorship apparatus functioned and how it changed in response to social, political and cultural change between the Republic in the 1930s and the transition to democracy in the late 1970s. It will gauge the effects of censorship on authors, groups and genres, comparing different responses to the constraints, and offer an overall assessment of the wider effects on theatrical activity. The book will make an important contribution not only to understanding of Spanish culture and politics in the 20th century but also to theorisation of the nature of censorship and the politics of aesthetics \(building on ideas from Foucault, Bourdieu, Rancière and Butler\). *La casa de Bernarda Alba* is one of the primary case studies in the monograph.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 There were two strands of activity, both focusing on Federico García Lorca’s *La casa de Bernarda Alba* \( *The House of Bernarda Alba*\), a set text in all English exam boards’ syllabuses for A\-level Spanish, and the Spanish play most frequently performed in the UK. The first strand comprised collaboration with the Spanish Theatre Company \(STC\) in London around their successful production of the play, while the second involved development of workshops for A\-level students with the Hexham\-based multilingual theatre company Théâtre Sans Frontières \(TSF\). Encouraging theatre\-makers, audiences, schoolteachers and their students to look at the play through the lens of censors’ reports between the 1940s and the 1960s has expanded their understanding of this iconic tragedy in relation to multiple contexts, and has influenced perceptions of how it can be performed in a way that brings out its social significance. In addition to the educational benefits for A\-level students and teachers, both strands have provided benefits to the partner organisations \(STC and TSF\) by changing the ways they target audiences and integrate their performance work with educational activities. 

####  \(a\) Support for performances \(November 2017 to March 2018, February 2019 and February 2020\) 

 STC’s production at the Cervantes Theatre in London was developed in consultation with Thompson and financially supported by a grant he obtained from the Spanish Ministry of Culture \(GBP12,790\). Performances were complemented by workshops developed with input from Thompson and post\-show Q & A sessions involving Thompson and members of the company. Schools bringing groups of students to the play were sent in advance an education pack produced by the company’s education officer in consultation with Thompson, informed by his research on censorship, for work in class before seeing the performance. The play was performed in both Spanish \(Monday\-Wednesday\) and English \(Thursday\-Saturday\), attracting general audiences in large numbers as well as school groups, and the link with censorship was highlighted in the promotional material for the production. An additional week of 9 performances in Spanish for schools, including a post\-show discussion led by Thompson, was run in February 2019 at Channing School in London. In February 2020, there were 31 performances in Spanish at the Cervantes Theatre, the Crescent Theatre in Birmingham and the Phoenix Theatre in Castleford \(bringing the total number of performances between 2017 and 2020 to 112\). The material in the education packs has been expanded and made available on the Cervantes Theatre website: <ins>schools.cervantestheatre.com/la\-casa\-de\-bernarda\-alba</ins> \[E4\]. In addition to enriching the experience of those who attended performances, the collaboration benefited the company by providing a distinctive focus for its first full season in its new venue and helping it to develop its educational role, making a significant and timely contribution to its mission of establishing itself as ‘a reference point in London for Spanish\-speaking culture’. 

 Thompson’s research on censorship influenced the way in which the production was conceived and marketed, emphasising the play’s political significance and its reception in Spain \[E1 and E2\]. The total number of spectators who saw the English or Spanish version of the production between November 2017 and February 2019 was 5,823, of whom 2,642 were secondary school students or teachers; approximately 70 of them attended the Q&A sessions led by Thompson, and education packs were sent out to 182 schools \[E2\]. Questionnaires completed by those who attended Q&A sessions showed that 92% of respondents found the information about censorship ‘very useful’ or ‘fairly useful’ for ‘understanding the importance of the play and/or Lorca’s work in general’ \[E3\]. One student confirmed that it ‘improves my understanding of the play, provides more depth’, while a teacher commented: ‘Excellent way to further understanding of the play. Makes the experience more valuable for A\-level students.’ The Spanish Theatre Company’s production reached a significant proportion \(approximately 16%\) of the cohorts of students taking A\-level Spanish in the school years between 2017 and 2018 \(7,591 entries in total\) and between 2018 and 2019 \(7,932 entries\), resulting in widespread influence on those students’ understanding of the play and on teachers’ approaches to teaching it. A further 168 school groups saw the production in early 2020. The company confirms that the collaboration with Thompson made a valuable contribution to the company’s progress towards fulfilling its unique mission of promoting Spanish\-language theatre in the UK: ‘Thompson’s initiative furthered the educational aspect of our mission \[…\], adding immense value to our artistic programme’ \[E2\]. 

####  \(b\) Workshops for A\-level students \(January 2018\) 

 Drama\-based workshops for schools developed in collaboration with Théâtre Sans Frontières \(TSF\) brought together Thompson’s archival research on censorship with TSF’s extensive experience of using drama for language learning. Four workshops were held \(one in Hexham, one in Durham and two in London\), involving a total of 81 students of A\-level Spanish and 12 teachers from 10 schools \[E6\]. The 3.5 hours of activities in each workshop allowed participants to benefit from Thompson’s research through role\-play facilitated by actors from TSF \[E5\]. 

 The workshops addressed the risk of over\-simplification in students’ understanding of the political impact of *La casa de Bernarda Alba*, offering them a more nuanced approach taking account of historical change and staging conditions. Evaluations from teachers and students were enthusiastic, confirming the originality of the approach and the value of integrating textual analysis, contextual knowledge, a focus on performance, and role\-play in Spanish. Of the 78 student respondents, 77 \(98.7%\) found the workshop interesting; 66 \(84.6%\) found it enjoyable; 59 \(75.6%\) found it useful; 54 \(69.2%\) agreed that ‘looking at *La casa de Bernarda Alba* in relation to censorship has changed the way I think about the play’; and 73 \(93.6%\) agreed that ‘the focus on performing *La casa de Bernarda Alba* was a good way of learning about censorship and Francoism’. One student commented that ‘I liked how engaging the learning was’, and another appreciated ‘the way you were always involved – not just telling you the context but making you part of it so you could understand/enjoy it better’ \[E6\]. 

 As well as contributing to the learning of the student participants, the workshops prompted productive reflection by the teachers on creative ways of combining cultural study and language learning \[E6\]. One teacher stated that ‘when I teach the play next year, I will definitely spend more time teaching the historical context’, while another commented: ‘Coupled with the performance at the Cervantes Theatre, your workshop has really made the study of Lorca's play very exciting for \[my students\] and they are very privileged to have had such a rich introduction to the text.’ Another confirmed that ‘the workshop was very rewarding for students and teachers alike, and I went away inspired, planning to bring more drama into the classroom and to use role\-play involving myself as well as the students. I have taught the play for a number of years \[...\] and will definitely stand back more and consider new ways into this important play’. One of the participating teachers disseminated a positive report on the experience to the 120 members of the Independent Schools Modern Languages Association \(ISMLA\) \[E7\]. TSF benefited by being enabled to adapt methods created for younger learners to 6th\-form\-level work with a richer, research\-informed content base. The Artistic Director confirms that the collaboration ‘deepened our knowledge and understanding of how to marry together fact and fiction to develop something that could go beyond the everyday and become a memorable and valuable learning experience for all involved’ and that ‘TSF now has a broader offer for future audiences’ \[E8\]. Materials from the workshops are archived on TSF’s website and can be downloaded, offering the possibility of further workshops in the future and encouraging re\-use of the materials by teachers \[E9 and E10\]. Detailed plans for a second series of four workshops in April 2020 had to be abandoned as a result of the Covid\-19 pandemic. 

 In order to further the continuing impact on teachers’ practice, Thompson and the Artistic Director of TSF spoke about the project at the UK\-Lingua conference on language learning in April 2019, which provided an opportunity to spread awareness amongst teachers of this new research\-led approach blending drama and learning about language and culture. There were 93 delegates \(66 from HE, 10 secondary and 1 primary teachers, 16 others\). Further dissemination of information about both parts of the Impact Case Study will come from an interview given by Thompson in October 2020 for an article on Spanish theatre in the UK to be published in the Spanish journal *Artescénicas* \(aimed at theatre professionals as well as an academic readership\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our research \(2001\-2020\) identified poor treatment outcomes for cancer in Teenagers and Young Adults \(TYA\), aged 13\-24, because of the non\-specialised NHS system for treating patients in this group. Our research substantiated new NHS policy in 2005 that introduced specialised TYA cancer services. From 2016 onwards, our work led to gradual improvement in the health outcomes for TYA. 

 Specialised treatment, designed for TYA as an age group, has significantly increased survival rates for TYA cancer patients, improved their quality of life and satisfaction with care received. Independent epidemiological data, citing our research, and national prospective cohort studies, designed using our research methodology, have demonstrated this impact. NHS specialised services now reach 1,400 TYA in the UK annually. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 TYA develop a specific spectrum of rare cancers. Before 2001, treatment outcomes for TYA were static or deteriorating, while contemporaneous children’s and older adults’ outcomes were rapidly improving. Cancer services and clinicians typically focused upon cancer by type, and TYA were expected to fit into services created for pre\-pubertal children or much older adults. Therefore, in the UK, TYA patients were allocated in haphazard locations, separately from other TYA, contributing to poor outcomes. For example, if two 17\-year olds presented with the same cancer while living on the same street, one could be cared for alongside 5\-year olds and the other alongside 75\-year olds. 

 In 2001, our group undertook original research to identify and characterise the causes of poor cancer treatment outcomes for TYA. We uncovered what should be in place to improve outcomes, and how outcomes should be evaluated. For the first time, our epidemiological research showed that high death rates were not entirely explained by traditional predictors; such as size and type of cancer \[ **1**\]. The causes of poor treatment outcomes were non\-specialist clinical skills, unsuitable treatment environments for TYA, and geographical dispersal of diagnostic and treatment processes. Patients treated in facilities with specialised services had 11% better cancer survival and greater receipt of standard treatments. The needs of TYA are specific to them, different to those of other age\-groups in terms of drug prescription, psychological response, and the built environment for care. Therefore, the type of cancer service seemed to be an important determinant of the outcome. 

 We established the first dedicated population\-based register for TYA to record cancer outcomes, the Yorkshire Specialist Register of Cancer in Children and Young People. Our unique Register covers all cancer diagnoses between age 0\-29 years in Yorkshire, enabling in\-depth assessment of trends in treatment and outcome for 10,700 children and TYA. The Register provides a platform to develop research methods, provide accurate timely data and define cancer outcomes \(Principal Investigator: Dr Feltbower, Medical Director: Professor Glaser\). Drs Feltbower and Stark conducted extended national cancer epidemiology studies in TYA, to map the evolving patterns of care and outcomes based on the hypothesis that change in NHS services would improve outcomes for TYA \[ **2, 3**\]. Some TYA had patterns of lower survival, which originated from poorer quality of care; particularly for certain cancer types which were mainly managed in local non\-specialised hospitals. 

 In 2005, NICE published guidance for improving patient outcomes, citing our research, with national reach \[ **1**\]. The guidance defined both the requirement and nature of new specialist cancer services for TYA. Original epidemiology led in Leeds, quantified the gradual evolution in specialised care across England \[ **4**\]. The odds of receiving care within a specialist service were identified at 35% for all geographical areas; varying from 22% to 72% \[ **4**\]. Early trends towards increased specialisation in some cancer types were observed. Specialisation in treatment was associated with improved survival. Patients who were treated in specialised TYA centres were less likely to die than those treated in other centres \[ **5**\]. From 1998\-2009, care for TYA with leukaemia outside of specialised care was associated with a 1.73\-fold increase in risk of death. Smaller effects were observed in patients with lymphoma and central nervous system tumours \[ **4, 5**\]. The advantage gained by receiving TYA specialised care was not due to differences in the clinical measures of the severity of the leukaemia. 

 We developed an original method to quantify the amount of specialised cancer care received by an individual TYA patient, using NHS data \[ **4**\]. We then studied the impact of this, using the methods developed in the Register, by examining relations between causes and effects. This was conducted under the BRIGHTLIGHT prospective national cohort study, during the period 2011\-2019, for which Feltbower and Stark were Co\-Investigators. BRIGHTLIGHT shows how NHS results changed after the application of the NICE guidance. The first results paper shows the impact of this research \[ **6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Improvements in cancer death rates and quality of life for TYA** 

 In 2005, research from Leeds was influential in the development of NICE guidance for improving cancer outcomes \[ **A**\]. There are 1,400 TYA diagnosed annually across various types of cancer in England. In 2019, NHS England published data comparing death rates for TYA between 2001 and 2013. Reductions in mortality have been revealed despite an increase in cancer incidence from 240 to 300 per million population \(pmp\). In 2001, the mortality for TYA was 44 pmp. In 2007, only 2 years after NICE guidance implementation, mortality was reduced to 42. Finally, in 2013, it was reduced to 32, resulting to a total of 27% reduction. 

 The BRIGHTLIGHT cohort study, to which the Leeds research team contributed key underpinning methods, reached over 1,200 TYA with cancer in over 100 NHS trusts in England between 2013 and 2017. Analyses indicate a significant positive impact from receiving specialised TYA cancer care \[ **B**\]. We observed improved metrics of care quality: 

-  78% had multi\-disciplinary team involvement in specialised care compared to 50% in non\-specialised care; 

-  44% of the TYA in specialised care who could benefit had their cancer precisely defined by contemporary molecular techniques compared to 22% in non\-specialised care; 

-  60% were assessed by rehabilitation services compared to 38%; 

-  73% of females received future fertility care compared to 43%. 

-  On a 0\-100 score, where 0 is poorest quality of life, patients receiving specialist cancer care improved by 15 points over 3 years, whereas those with no specialised care improved by 10 points. The patients treated in specialised care were also more severely unwell at the outset. A similar pattern of improved psychological morbidity was observed. 

 Internationally, cancer survival analyses have started to indicate the impact of our work. In the Nordic countries, Rostgaard *et al* have widely cited the application of our work, and analysed Nordic cancer registers to examine cancer survival for TYA. In 1999, cancer survival was 58%. In 2013, this increased to 77% survival \[ **C**\]. 

  

 **Impact upon clinical services and corresponding patient confidence** 

 *United Kingdom* 

 The impacts since 2013 upon outcomes are mediated by changes within the 2005 NHS policy. Wilkinson *et al* \[ **1**\] was cited within the NICE policy document \(2005\), mandating the creation of specialist cancer services for TYA within the NHS, and specifying the features of this specialised care \[ **D**\]. These services were gradually embedded within the NHS after 2005. 

 In 2001, there were 5 TYA cancer services in the world; one of which was in Leeds. By 2018, these increased to 26 in the UK due to our collaborative efforts. An independent patient experience analysis of surveys by Furness *et al*, using data from all TYA with cancer in England, demonstrated that TYA have more confidence in their care in specialised units \[ **E**\]. Moreover, improvement in satisfaction with care was revealed. 

 *International Reach* 

 There are indications that the process of specialisation in the UK is also improving cancer services internationally. Lewis was Co\-Chair of Clinical Care Models within the US National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute and US Department of Health for Adolescent and Young Adult \(AYA\). This formed a Progress Review Group in 2006 which discussed the need for treating AYAs as a distinct group with special needs for clinical care and psychosocial support services. An infographic from Lewis’ research entitled ‘Key Elements of Patient\-Centred Pathway’ was used to drive the panel’s discussion on the definition of a new model of care. The outcomes were published in the Report “Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology Progress Review Group”, whereby three main priorities were identified to promote a consistent standard for delivery of care to the AYA population \[ **F**\]. This report led to the creation of a workshop, sponsored by the American National Cancer Institute, entitled “Next Steps in Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology” which determined key decisions around AYA specialist care \[ **G**\]. These resulted in creating more AYA specialist clinical teams within US hospitals. By 2020, AYA specialist clinical teams were established within 42 US hospitals \[ **H**\], compared to 2 hospitals up to 2012. 

 Stark and Lewis led the TYA cancer research within the EU\-FP7 European Network for Cancer in Children and Adolescents, for the period 2011\-2016 \[ **I**\]. The network began with only 10 people working just in the UK, France and Germany, and received funds from the European Union to bring specialists together to achieve a shared understanding in treating TYA. By the end of 2016, the network consisted of approximately 350 people and had members from all but two EU nations. Since 2013, clinical networks of specialist TYA cancer wards were founded in 5 further regions of France, and entirely new networks and services were dedicated to TYA within the national Cancer Plans of Netherlands, Denmark and Eire. 

 Stark and Lewis were the invited international keynote speakers for the inauguration policy forum between the German adult and paediatric cancer societies in 2013. Their involvement resulted in the establishment of a new professional transition group; the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Adoleszenten junge Erwachsene. Stark was also an invited expert by the Indian Cancer Services in 2017, and his role was key for their launch of specialist TYA services \[ **J**\]. 

 **Impact on international professional education 

 Stark is an inaugural member of the Adolescent and Young Adult education committee, jointly run by the European Society of Medical Oncology \(ESMO\) and Societe Internationale Oncologie Pediatrique European \(SIOPE\). He was a keynote speaker at the first ESMO medical training course on TYA oncology in 2018. His lectures addressed 39 oncology specialists from 18 nations for a Europe\-wide professional certification and received excellent feedback. Delegates responded that following this course, they would change the selection of treatment for TYA, include multidisciplinary team advice, provide TYA specific psychological support and introduce improved patient assessments \[ **K**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Enrico Biffis and Erik Chavez, both at the Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis at Imperial College Business School, conducted the research. The research outputs led to the design and deployment of an innovative parametric agricultural insurance product backed by a global reinsurer, which allowed banks to extend credit to smallholder farmers previously excluded from the financial system. Two large pilots were run in Tanzania involving 50,000 farmers and benefiting a total of close to 400,000 individuals, including household members and field workers. The pilots resulted in a total of $13m being lent by banks as input loans and $5m of insurance coverage being extended by a leading local insurer.  The research made parametric insurance become part of the underwriting criteria used by the most important Tanzanian banks operating in the agricultural space. The research generated sizeable additional funding \($5m\) targeting the upscaling of the de\-risking solution within Tanzania and the expansion to three new countries \(Ghana, Uganda, Zimbabwe\), thus aiming to benefit over 1.6m individuals.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research originates from two strands of work carried out by the two main researchers involved in the project. 

1.  The first strand of research relates to machine learning techniques used to determine optimal weather variables and synthetic crop yields \( **ref. 2**\). By capturing farm level characteristics \(soil, inputs, agricultural practice\), the modelling tools provide a powerful machinery to not only de\-risk agricultural production, but also promote technology adoption \( **refs. 1 and 2**\).  The latter objective is achieved by monetizing the risk profile induced by production technology via insurance premia and borrowing costs, as obtained in the second, parallel strand of work. 

1.  The second strand of research relates to the optimal design of risk transfer arrangements in non\-standard settings, such as those featuring default risk and the availability of different forms of collateralization to shape the credit risk of a transaction and hence its price \( **refs. 3 and 6**\). Both the optimal design of parametric insurance and inclusion of the latter in the collateral mix deliver credit enhancement to smallholder farmers, making them less capital intensive for banks \( **ref. 3 and 5**\) and reducing credit rationing for poorer households \( **ref. 1**\). 

 Details of the main research activities carried out and relevant collaborators are as follows. 

 **Sourcing of data** on weather patterns, soil characteristics, input packages and farmers' characteristics. The data sourcing effort was crucial to inform machine learning tools and produce risk profiles of agricultural risk exposures at particular locations. Although subsets of data are available from public satellite and crop modelling data repositories, new granular datasets were created by relying on the work of Imperial researchers regularly visiting farmer organizations and financial institutions on the ground. In particular, the researchers had regular meetings with three local banks \(CRDB Bank, NMB Bank, TADB\) and a Finance PhD student \(Davide Benedetti\) supervised by Enrico Biffis spent one month assisting local banks in collecting data to analyse the impact of weather events on agribusiness loan performance \( **source 9**\). Both local banks and the Private Agricultural Sector Support Trust of Tanzania were instrumental in hosting Enrico Biffis and Erik Chavez to carry out work on exposure data collection \( **sources 2 and 3**\). Understanding of the target farmers was informed by running surveys in partnership with the World Bank as part of a larger randomized control trial project \( **source 7**\). 

 The **optimal design of parametric insurance** relied on the optimization tools discussed above \(research strands 1 and 2\). The main challenge was to tailor insurance pay\-outs not only to the risk profile associated with the use of a given production technology, but also, to the default risk profile of farmers ultimately benefiting from the bundled finance solution \( **ref 1, 6**\). Use of granular data on risk exposures allowed the Imperial team to mitigate farmers' exposure to climate variability and hence reduce their propensity to default on input loans during the crop growing cycle \( **refs 2, 3, and 5**\). Assistance from a global reinsurer, Munich Re, was instrumental in receiving commercial grade validation of the algorithms developed and demonstrating the value of parametric insurance to the loan underwriting officers of the main banks involved \( **source 4**\). 

 Enrico Biffis obtained support from the Tanzanian Insurance Regulatory Authority \(TIRA\) to grant the relevant licence for Munich Re, thus allowing the innovative de\-risking solution to be adopted by a leading local insurer, Jubilee, as well as Tanzania Re, the governmental reinsurance vehicle \( **sources 1, 2, and 4**\). **Institutional support** was instrumental in allowing all stakeholders involved, including smallholder farmers, to benefit from a cost\-effective de\-risking solution being deployed across the value chain \( **source 2**\). 

 The Imperial team collaborated with The World Bank to document the benefits generated by the project for smallholder farmers. The **monitoring and evaluation** exercise entailed limiting the availability of the bundled finance solution to a subset of farmers, so as to have treatment and control groups. The surveys were jointly designed by the Imperial team and a World Bank team led by Luc Christiaensen \( **source 7**\). The results allowed us to compute several measures of impact further discussed in section 4 and covered in reference 3.1 \( **ref 1**\) below.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research impact can be understood by looking at three categories of stakeholders: 

 **Smallholder farmers**. It is well documented \( **ref. 1**\) that standalone insurance is poorly understood by smallholder farmers and that take\-up is usually low due to a number of factors ranging from liquidity constraints to poor performance of insurance contracts \(basis risk\). By bundling a loan with an insurance mechanism tailored to farm level production characteristics, the value of insurance could be recognized at a bank's portfolio level and hence result in lower collateral requirements, thus allowing the credit worthiness of smallholder farmers to increase dramatically \( **ref. 1, sources 2, 3, and 4**\). In the words of Nicomed Bohay \(MD at Private Agricultural Sector Support Trust of Tanzania\), ""the presence of both insurance and a credit guarantee delivered sizeable credit enhancement to smallholder farmers usually excluded from the financial system due to lack of credit history and collateral to be offered as security"" \( **source 2**\). The monitoring and evaluation exercises carried out in collaboration with the World Bank allowed us to quantify the impact of two pilots carried out during the growing seasons of 2015\-16 and 2016\-17. A total of 50,000 households benefited from the insurance programme across Tanzania. By analysing the household members involved in agricultural production, as well as external labour hired to work on the fields, a total of nearly 400,000 individuals benefited from the project over two years \( **sources 2, 5**\). As documented by the World Bank, on average 30% of field labour was contributed by individuals outside of the households involved, and 88% of such households gained access to finance for the very first time \( **source 7**\). By accessing funding predicated on the purchase of better input packages \(and associated access to extension services\), smallholder farmers were able to double their average production yield. As the smallholder farmers targeted had an average farm size of only 2.1 hectares, the ability to boost production was truly transformational, pushing production levels considerably above the survival \(and hence default\) line, and allowing part of the crop proceeds to be saved and re\-invested \( **sources 2, 7**\). 

 **Banks**. Smallholder farmers are traditionally shunned by commercial banks due to lack of credit history, output volatility, and the fact that for subsistence farmers defaulting on a loan is often a matter of survival. This is why smallholder farmers have low credit standing and limited resources to post as collateral. They are therefore stuck in a vicious circle preventing them from accessing the financial system \( **ref 1, source 3**\). Banks understood that the parametric insurance solution developed by the Imperial team could de\-risk their aggregate portfolio if bundled with individual input loans. In this way credit rationing was circumvented and loan underwriting officers could unlock access to finance. As documented by Xavery Makwi \(Director of Credit at CRDB Bank of Tanzania\), ""the novel insurance framework introduced by Prof. Enrico Biffis and Dr. Erik Chavez allowed us to assess the credit standing of smallholder farmers in a different way, by taking into account the purchase of parametric weather insurance as part of our underwriting criteria"" \( **source 3**\). The Imperial team carried out repeated missions to Dar es Salaam and was successful in embedding the insurance mechanism in the loan portfolios of two leading Tanzanian banks, CRDB Bank and NMB Bank. Akiba Bank and Tanzanian Agricultural Development Bank \(TADB\) can also be numbered as initial and prospective participants in the programme, respectively. The missions entailed meetings with loan underwriting officers, local insurers, regulators, and farmer organizations, as well as having researchers \(Davide Benedetti, Enrico Biffis, Erik Chavez\) being hosted at CRDB Bank and PASS for data collection \( **sources 2, 3, and 9**\). With an average loan disbursement of $255 per farmer, a total of close to $13m in aggregate loans was underwritten across CRDB Bank and NMB Bank \( **sources 2 and 3\)**. To give an idea of the relevance of this figure, we can consider the case of CRDB Bank, which has close to 50% of the agricultural credit market share in Tanzania, with a $130m agricultural loan portfolio as of April 2019 \( **source 8**\). Despite its leadership position, less than 1% of CRDB Bank's borrowers were smallholder farmers in 2015.  In the words of Xavery Makwi, CRDB's Director of Credit, the project ""allowed us to extent input loans to this customer group, generating a fivefold increase in smallholder farmer accounts during pilots covering around 50,000 farmers over two growing seasons"" \( **source 3**\). 

 **Insurers**. Indemnity based insurance contracts are difficult to deploy and manage in emerging countries due to poor data quality, limited claims experience, significant moral hazard, and high monitoring costs. Parametric insurance products offer a valuable alternative, but their take up is hindered by exacting upfront premiums and imperfect pay\-outs \( **ref 1**\). As indicated by Judith Rugaiganisa \(Head of Reinsurance at Jubilee Insurance Tanzania\), ""our success in penetrating the agricultural insurance market for smallholder farmers had been limited to date. Across the industry, no robust market instrument was available to allow us to introduce crop loss insurance in a cost\-effective manner in Tanzania and upscale it across the country"". The project brought to market a cost\-effective solution \(35% cheaper than the closest alternative\) by exploiting the scaling opportunities offered by a data driven technology aimed at reaping country\-wide diversification benefits while simultaneously tailoring coverage to the needs of particular borrowers, thus linking insurance to creditworthiness \( **ref 2, sources 1, 2 and 3**\). The project allowed a leading local insurer, Jubilee, to extend a total of $5m of coverage over two years, the residual portion of loans at risk being covered by a credit guarantee offered by the Private Agricultural Services Support Trust of Tanzania \( **source 1**\). This provided the insurer with the opportunity to enter the smallholder farmer market for the first time during the first season. Insurance coverage represented a 70% yearly increase in agricultural business for Jubilee by the end of the second season \( **source 1**\). In the words of Judith Rugaiganisa, ""the parametric crop loss insurance product was deployed for two crop seasons in Tanzania covering over 50,000 farmers, thus making it the largest crop loss insurance programme available in the country at that time"". Coordination with underwriters and the Tanzanian Insurance Regulatory Authority allowed part of the risk to be retained in country instead of being transferred to international risk carriers only. Munich Re, the global reinsurer which acted as lead risk carrier, ""provided a domestic insurance company, Jubilee, and the local government backed reinsurer, Tanzania Re, with the confidence to underwrite weather risk insurance for a total of $13m input loans extended by leading Tanzanian banks"", as documented by Alexa Meyer\-Bosse \(Global Agricultural Risks and Climate Change Lead at Munich Re\) \( **source 4**\). 

 Although the project only focused on the maize value chain, its success attracted further funding for upscaling within and beyond Tanzania. As explained by Tanaka Tabassum \(Climate\-KIC\), the scalability of the de\-risking solution by use of satellite data and machine learning ""is an appealing feature for a number of stakeholders. Climate\-KIC leveraged on that to work on two sizeable follow\-up projects. The first one, funded by the New Venture Fund, aims at deploying the de\-risking solutions developed by the Imperial team to assist women farmers in accessing finance and promoting gender inclusion among smallholder farmers and cooperatives. The second project, funded by the African Development Bank, aims at upscaling the de\-risking solution to include a larger pool of banks in Tanzania and promote its extension to three other countries \(Ghana, Uganda, Zimbabwe\). The target of the project is to facilitate the financial inclusion and climate de\-risking of up to 1.6 million farmers across the four countries."" \( **source 5\)**. In the words of Oryem Henry Okello \(Uganda's Minister of State for International Affairs\), "" The tools developed \[by the Imperial team\] represent a valuable contribution to our Green Growth Development Strategy "". The Imperial team continues to provide technical assistance on i\) the upscaling of the project within Tanzania across both the maize and sunflower value chains \( **source 2**\), ii\) the extension of the de\-risking solution to three new countries \(Ghana, Uganda, Zimbabwe\) \( **sources 2, 5, and 6**\), and iii\) the introduction of a gender inclusion dimension in access to credit \( **source 5**\).  In 2019, Climate KIC/EIT awarded a further EUR 3.2m funding stream \(ARISE project\) to a consortium led by the Imperial team to embed incentives to adopt climate smart agricultural practices within the de\-risking framework deployed across the four sub\-Saharan African countries mentioned above \( **sources 2, 5**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Dr Ruth Hemus’ research into women exponents of Dada, an early twentieth century avant\-garde arts movement, broke new ground by transforming understanding of women’s innovative participation in and artistic contributions to it. Her book *Dada’s Women* \(2009\) directly informed the curation of exhibitions in Switzerland, Italy, the U.K. and Norway over a six\-year period \(2014\-2020\), reaching 88,694 visitors. Hemus’ research inspired contemporary women artists to create collaborative mixed\-media outputs and musical compositions in dialogue with work by Dada women, that were exhibited in museums and community contexts. Her research informed public\-facing events that engage diverse audiences in forms of creative practice that had been underrepresented in histories of the Dada movement, and is used to promote the work of innovative women in the arts more broadly. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The European Dada movement of the early twentieth century was long regarded as a male preserve, one in which women were relegated to footnotes or mentioned only as the wives, girlfriends, or sisters of Dada men. Hemus’ research into Dada’s women challenged that assumption. Her publications, dating back to her appointment to Royal Holloway as a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow in 2007, have centred on Emmy Hennings and Sophie Taeuber in Zurich, Hannah Höch in Berlin, and Suzanne Duchamp and Céline Arnauld in Paris. Hemus has shown how these five individuals, too often overlooked, made important interventions across fine art, literature, and performance in three key geographical hubs. Through intense archival work Hemus created an extensive bibliography of Arnauld’s books and magazine contributions, uncovered her Jewish\-Romanian roots, and has published several essays and a monograph on this neglected poet. In sum Hemus demonstrates not only how some of the techniques employed by Dada’s women chimed with the movement’s rebellion against aesthetic and cultural conventions, but also highlights ways in which they were innovators, not imitators. As well as changing minds about these individuals, her research has confronted accepted understandings of Dada more broadly, proposing that it is no longer sufficient to see it as a men’s club. This prescient work came into its own in 2016, the centenary year of Dada’s beginning in Zurich, when the movement came under renewed scholarly scrutiny and garnered popular attention. Her research into Arnauld has drawn particular attention from both academic reviewers and curators. 

 In her prize\-nominated monograph *Dada’s Women* \(2009, 1800 copies sold\) Hemus presented for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the contributions to the movement made by women artists and writers. Dada, born during the First World War, was characterized by a spirit of rebellion against prevailing norms, and by a high degree of experimentation with media, representation and performance. As such it proved to be both provocative and influential, paving the way for later movements and radical styles including Surrealism, Conceptual Art and Pop Art. Hemus’ research documents how women artists shaped the movement by championing a particular hybridity of form and genre, and rejecting traditional notions of ‘authorship’ and figurative representation. She argues that an approach to art in which the corporeal and performance played an important role, as well as intermedial practices such as photomontage and collage, and more traditional crafts including tapestry and puppetry, can fruitfully be understood in relation to women’s practice. Far from only inserting their work into a fixed canon with historical limits, Hemus’ enquiries point to its relevance for twenty\-first century practitioners and audiences alike. In that vein she has extended her activities to research by practice. Partnerships with artists for the digital age combine text, sound and image and blend genres, media and forms. Dissemination via large\-scale exhibitions, original artworks and interactive workshops broadcast Hemus’ research. The international reach, regularity and longevity of her associations with a wide range of beneficiaries bear witness to the primacy of her published work as the touchstone for women in Dada. One hundred years after the movement’s inception the impetus to recognise women in the arts proves to be no less timely.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Hemus’ research has reframed the role of women in Dada, revitalising interest in their work to inform creativity, culture and cultural learning. Firstly, it has directly inspired the curation of 4 exhibitions that have foregrounded avant\-garde women, in Switzerland, Italy, the UK and Norway. Secondly, it has influenced contemporary visual artists and musicians through the commissioning of, and collaborations on new works of art. Thirdly, it has formed the basis of active learning workshops with school groups and members of the public to deepen understanding of avant\-garde women’s innovative creative practice. In sum, it has helped to change perceptions of a major artistic movement, both among arts professionals and the general public. 

1.  <ins> **Inspiring exhibitions and influencing curation**</ins> 

 *Die Dada La Dada She Dada* \(2014\-2016\) was the first ever exhibition devoted to women Dadaists. Staged in Switzerland in advance of the Dada centenary, it toured 3 venues, Forumschlossplatz Aarau, 25 October 2014 – 18 January 2015, Kunstmuseum Appenzell, 22 March 2015 – 28 June 2015 and Le Manoir de la Ville de Martigny, 3 October – 10 January 2016, reaching 4,438 visitors in both German\- and French\-speaking regions. Curator Ina Boesch calls Hemus ‘a vital presence in the process of curation.’ She reports that Hemus’ research ‘stood out particularly for its pioneering analysis of the body of work by Céline Arnauld, a poet that nobody was talking or writing about. Thanks to Dr Hemus’s book we decided to include Arnauld \(…\) in the exhibition’ \(S1\). Hemus further shaped the visitor’s experience in these specific ways: she provided a recorded interview and first\-edition books as items in the exhibition; she co\-led with Boesch the opening public tour; she contributed essays both to the catalogue and related volume of essays \(R3\). 

 The exhibition *La Grande Madre / The Great Mother* was held at the Trussardi Foundation, Milan \(26 August – 15 November 2015\). Hemus’ book \(R1\) directly informed the curation of the show and led to a commissioned essay for the catalogue \(English and Italian, print run 8,000, R5\). The curator, Massimilano Gioni, points to both influence and reach, ‘not only had I much to learn from Hemus’s research, even in the choices of which artworks and artists to include in the exhibition, but I also felt it was important to share her perspective with \(…\) a public that was larger than the professional art world and the world of art historians’ \(S3\). The exhibition attracted 48,000 visitors. 

 *Exploding Collage*, Hatton Gallery, Newcastle \(24 October 2018 – 16 February 2019\), 8,784 visitors. This show brought together practitioners of collage from the past and present. \[text removed for publication\] whose emphasis was on artists who have been less recognised in canonical histories, cites Hemus’ book *Dada's Women* \(R1\) as a driving force in her research and approach, noting that she \[text removed for publication\] \(S4\). 

 *The Great Monster Dada Show*, Henie Onstad, Norway \(25 October 2019 – 26 January 2020\). The curator, Ana María Bresciani, acknowledged that Hemus’ book \(R1\) was instrumental in a decision to foreground women in the exhibition \(S5\). Visitor numbers of 27,473 were unusually high and included multiple middle and high school groups \(S5\). One press reviewer noted that women artists were ‘well represented in the exhibition and through an essay by Dr Ruth Hemus in the catalogue’ \(sales 403\) \(S5\). Henie Onstad, KHIO \(Oslo National Academy of the Arts\) and the Goethe\-Institut \(Oslo\) together funded a visiting residency for Hemus where she spoke at a cabaret event that attracted 315 visitors \(November 2019\). Bresciani writes, ‘Hemus’s language is very accessible and her oral skills are reachable to both a general and a specialized audience’. She praises Hemus’ quest to ‘revisit history and open up other spaces of thought and discourse in younger generations to come’ \(S5\). 

1.  <ins> **Shaping contemporary artistic practice**</ins> 

 Hemus’ rediscovery of Dada women has inspired new work by women artists. Her recovery of Arnauld informed the commission of original artworks for the Dada centenary. One example was *Projecteur* \(2016\), a video work by the Swiss artist Anne\-Julie Raccoursier produced in dialogue with Arnauld’s poetry for the 2014\-16 exhibition *Die Dada La Dada She Dada*. Curator Boesch notes, ‘for Raccoursier Arnauld’s work was a revelation, as much it was for me and other readers of Ruth’s book, and for the visitors to the exhibition. As a result of the exhibition, our visitors gained an understanding that Dada is also female’ \(S1\). A second instance was *Vergessenes Gelächter* \(Forgotten Laughter\), a theatrical performance of Arnauld’s poetry by the Swiss National Theatre actor Isabelle Menke and musician Bo Wiget. First performed at the Theater Tuchlaube Aarau \(November 2015\) it was selected by the Schauspielhaus Zürich \(National Theatre\) for its centennial Festspiele festival \(June 2016\). Boesch clarifies that discussions with Hemus ‘played a crucial role in the selection of works’ \(S1\). 

 In addition, Hemus’ work has been the inspiration for the foundation of an arts collective \(2014\-\). Partners are Dr Sonia Allori, a Scottish\-based composer, musician and music therapist, and Vaia Paziana, a visual artist who works with Certitude, a London\-based charity supporting individuals with learning disabilities, autism or mental health challenges. Together they draw on techniques employed by Dada women, including chance, collage and collaboration, to produce multimedia work. Allori writes, ‘The influence of Ruth’s research on my work was direct and immediate. I have always found it difficult to describe my work which involves the abstract, the absurd and the serious and in Dada it found a home’ \(S8\). Paziana points to a renewed employment in her work of fabric, lace and weaving, prompted by *Dada’s Women*. She writes, ‘I can say that there is a constant presence of the ‘Dada women’s voices’ in the back of my mind, may it be at the planning start of devising workshops or the early stages of a new project –  they are not going anywhere’ \(S8\). 

1.  <ins> **R</ins><ins>aising</ins> <ins>awareness of avant\-garde women via</ins> <ins>creative participation**</ins> 

 Allori, Hemus and Paziana’s collaborative activities prioritise work that is accessible to audiences with different abilities. Events are characterized by their combination of new outputs with interactive public learning, details of which are shared more widely on the project web\-page \(S8\). Three examples of events include: 

 \(i\) For *Gatherings*, a season of invited interventions connected to the exhibition *Exploding Collage*, Allori, Hemus and Paziana were invited to occupy an architectural pod. Together they produced and installed an immersive multimedia collage of digital visuals and soundscape. Visitors were invited to make changes to the grotto using craft materials over the course of the exhibition. On the day of installation the team hosted a group of 13 young people \(age 16–21\) from Hatton Gallery’s learning project. One wrote, ‘It’s a real inspiration to be able to meet actual artists who are part of the programme. They were so interesting and so kind to us – and they were interested in what we are doing too’ \(S4\). \[text removed for publication\] reports that as a direct result of this dialogue the group produced their own intervention on the life and work of a woman Dadaist. The outreach team also developed a Dada poetry workshop and digital resource for the gallery \(S4\). 

 \(ii\) A performance of music and words was commissioned by artist \[text removed for publication\] for a public event *Spring Soup Dada* at Wasps Studio, Glasgow \(29 March 2018\). Allori composed and performed an original score with words scripted by Hemus. Audience members took part in a lottery to dictate sequences of sound. In an opening \[text removed for publication\] \(S7\). Hemus’ research has shaped \[text removed for publication\] ongoing project to introduce Dada’s women to educational and community groups. 

 \(iii\) *Performing Dada’s Women,* *Tate Exchange*, London \(March 2017\). An original musical composition incorporating found sounds by Allori and digital animation by Paziana offered a launchpad for school pupils, university students, community groups and the general public to produce their own chance poetry and visual collages. This embodied creative production offered a novel way of learning about avant\-garde women. 100% of participants who responded to a questionnaire thought their knowledge had increased as a result of the workshop \(S9\). One wrote, ‘The event \(…\) inspired a less rigid, systematic attitude towards study/creative practice’ \(S9\). Another reported ‘The sessions showed me how taking research out into the public sphere and adapting it for a wider audience of all ages, can be fun, engaging, and inspiring’ \(S9\). The feedback cards themselves were designed for creative verbal and visual responses. For example, ‘What is Dada / Who is Dada / How Dada are you?’ produced answers such as ‘Fun / We all are / I am\! \(S9\). Subsequent events have focused on Dada’s women and war \(2018\) and feminist activism \(2019\), each attended by around 50 participants. A school student from 2018 wrote ‘I feel a lot more informed about the movement and inspired by the work’ \(S9\). An example remark from 2019 was, ‘I never really thought that art could give such a powerful activist message until doing it today’ \(S9\). 

 Both Allori and Paziana continue to draw on initial collaborative work with Hemus in further independent projects. Of a 2020 series of music sessions for people with learning disabilities Allori writes, ‘these workshops introduced \(…\) Dada to young people who might not otherwise have experienced this’ \(S8\). Paziana reports, ‘members of the communities I’ve worked with, who don’t have access to arts education \(…\) have responded with curiosity, with gratitude, with creativity and continued interest’ \(S8\). 

 <ins> **Reach and longevity: transforming and sustaining the legacies of Dada’s women**</ins> 

 Hemus’ research into the women of Dada has had multiple direct impacts on curators, creative practitioners and their publics. Curator Nadine Schneider writes, ‘Ruth Hemus challenges with her work the conventions of \(art\) historiography. Both through her writing and her lectures, she manages to reach very wider non\-academic audiences without losing any of the academic “sense and sensitivity”’ \(S1\). Massimiliano Gioni, too, points to its transformative effect, ‘I think it is rare than one can find within the field of art history an inspiration to rethink one’s own place in the world’ \(S3\). Hemus’ work is part of an important rethinking of the role of women artists in the European avant\-garde. As Gioni states, ‘Hemus has won a crucial place among these great pioneers of a new history of modern art’ \(S3\). Through exhibitions, commissions and learning programmes – held in 10 locations, in 5 countries, over a 5\-year period – Hemus’ work has been vital both in changing perceptions of Dada’s women and in establishing the power of their legacies one hundred years after the movement’s inception.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In the UK there are 300,000 legally blind individuals and over 40,000,000 worldwide, yet 90% of these have some remaining residual sight. As a result of 3 years of research at the University of Oxford, Prof. Philip Torr \(Department of Engineering Science\) and Dr. Steve Hicks \(Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences\) collaborated to create smart glasses, non\-invasive wearable devices that use intelligent image interpretation technology to allow those who are legally blind to use their remaining residual vision to see again. OxSight Ltd was spun out to commercialise the smart glasses. OxSight’s current valuation is GBP40,000,000 and it employs 43 members of staff. In 2018, the CE\-certified PRISM and CRYSTAL models entered the UK, EU, Chinese, and South American markets aimed at the visually impaired suffering from tunnel vision. To date, **\[text removed for publication\]** units have been sold totalling **\[text removed for publication\]**. Testimonials from users have demonstrated how these have positively impacted their lives, giving them back confidence, freedom, and improving their quality of life. A third product, ONYX, is currently being trialled for central vision loss, and, like the existing commercial products, is receiving positive feedback from those involved in the trial: 100% of users reported improved facial detection and 75% could read better with the product. 

 Computer vision software developed in the UoA that underpins these glasses is also present in a number of Huawei’s flagship products, such as the Huawei Mate10 and the Huawei Honor V10, to enhance photo capabilities. In 2018, Huawei was the 5<sup>th</sup> most used smartphone brand, and there were over 17,000,000 Huawei Mate 10 series phones \(5.9% of all Huawei products\) active in the world.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prof. Torr’s research focuses on the mathematical theory of computer vision and artificial intelligence, and the development of algorithms and software for intelligent image interpretation. A particular emphasis at the University of Oxford has been on computer tools which allow for real\-time, interactive understanding of the visual world, especially three\-dimensional reconstruction and learning of scenes, segmentation of images, and object motion tracking, all of which can be implemented in mobile cameras such as those on phones, drones, intelligent glasses for the visually impaired or other robot devices. 

 The tools developed by Prof. Torr and his group address key problems in computer vision. Most computer vision algorithms learn from image sets that have been labelled and segmented by human observers, but human labelling is time\-consuming and costly. ‘Weakly supervised learning’ removes this dependence; computer vision and graphics applications are enhanced by software which can automatically estimate the salient regions in images \(the most useful and informative areas for a human viewer\) without any prior assumption or knowledge of the contents of those images. The research at \[ **R1**\] \(conducted in collaboration with researchers at other universities in China, the UK and the USA\) implemented a regional contrast\-based salient object detection algorithm capable of producing full\-resolution, high\-quality saliency maps which represent the image in a way that is easier for the computer to analyse. The algorithm consistently outperformed 15 other methods, even when analysing ‘noisy’ internet images where the saliency regions are not clear. This work has been used extensively by many other researchers and companies as the basis for learning weakly supervised object recognition. 

 The group has also worked extensively on pixel\-level labelling tasks, such as semantic segmentation, where each pixel of an image is labelled with a corresponding class of what is being represented \(person, table, background etc\). Deep learning techniques are limited in their ability to delineate visual objects in this way, but Prof. Torr’s insight was to introduce a system which combined the strengths of two separate computer vision tools, Convolutional Neural Networks and Conditional Random Fields \[ **R2**\]. This was the first work to combine deep models with Markov random fields. When applied to the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark \(a standard image dataset for building and evaluating this type of algorithm\), the new model outperformed competition from tech giants such as Google and Microsoft. 

 In \[ **R3**\], Prof. Torr and colleagues approached the problem of object tracking in video footage by equipping a basic tracking algorithm with a deep learning tool: a novel Siamese \(twin\) neural network that had been trained for object detection in video. Despite its simplicity, the tracker was capable of operating at frame\-rates beyond real\-time. This work represented a paradigm shift away from the previous traditional tracking methods to those based on deep learning and is much cited by subsequent work on tracking. 

 Prof. Torr’s expertise in the field of computer vision led in 2015 to a research collaboration with Dr. Hicks, a neuroscientist at Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences. Dr. Hicks had built a prototype visor to investigate visual perception and depth processing in low vision, which established a proof of principle design for smart glasses for visually impaired people. The collaboration drew on Prof. Torr’s extensive research into deep learning, semantic segmentation and visual object tracking, which enabled him to envisage what was possible \(and what was not\), and then develop specific relevant computer vision tools. These reduce a complex visual scene to its task\-relevant elements, allowing the glasses to extract meaning from the environment and enhancing the spatial awareness of their users. \[ **R4**, **R5** and **R6**\] were the product of this joint research. 

 \[ **R4**\] set a new benchmark in the real\-time tracking of visual objects in video by framing it as a machine learning problem and examining how visual adaptation could be performed continually. It has also influenced a large body of subsequent work. \[ **R5**\] introduces SemanticPaint, a real\-time, interactive system for the geometric reconstruction, object\-class segmentation and learning of 3D scenes. The user interacts physically with the real\-world scene, touching objects and using voice commands to assign them appropriate labels. These labels feed into an online machine learning algorithm, which then predicts labels for previously unseen parts of the scene. \[ **R6**\] describes an augmented reality system for large\-scale 3D reconstruction and recognition in outdoor scenes. As well as producing a map of the 3D environment in real\-time, the system allows the user to draw with a laser pointer directly onto the reconstruction to segment the model into objects. The system then learns to segment other parts of the 3D map. This novel object labelling system can be implemented in smart glasses to help visually impaired users to navigate safely through spaces by identifying semantic classes of objects, such as the difference between the footpath and the road.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Prof. Torr’s expertise in the field of computer vision and AI, described in section 2, led to his collaboration with Dr Hicks, a neuroscientist at Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences. Their joint work \[ **R4**, **R5** and **R6**\] led to the creation of non\-invasive wearable glasses with algorithms that allow the glasses to make sense of their environment and exploit the remaining residual vision of the user to allow them to see again. These devices are granting users independence and freedoms previously unavailable to them. To further increase impact OxSight Ltd. was spun out to commercialise their products PRISM, CRYSTAL \(for users with tunnel vision\), and forthcoming ONYX \(for users with central vision loss\) and now has offices around the globe to reach more people with sight loss. 

###  *Health Impact – improving quality of life and granting more freedom to those suffering sight loss* 

 The glasses, in their various iterations from smart glasses to the commercial products PRISM and CRYSTAL, have had a dramatic effect on improving the quality of life of the partially sighted. The earliest versions of “Smart Glasses” in the 200\-person Royal National Institute of Blind People \(RNIB\) trial from 2015\-2016 demonstrated the positive impact on quality of life in a controlled environment and take\-home tests. The “Smart Glasses” were the result of research into low\-cost and non\-invasive wearable technologies using an augmented reality display system based on depth cameras and see\-through displays to enhance sight for obstacle avoidance, face recognition and object recognition. 66% of the 2015 RNIB trial cohort found the Smart Glasses were beneficial in a range of environments. The study found that up to 50% of legally blind people with conditions such as glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa could get a direct and immediate benefit from vision enhancement. \[ **S1**\] Those involved the trial gave positive testimonials: 

 *“When having a one\-to\-one conversation with my partner across the dining room, I was able to see facial features, glasses and earrings for the first time in years. ... It provided vision I have not seen in years, actually recognizing facial features*”. 

 *“\[the Smart Glasses\] give me a lot of confidence. I can recognise faces which I couldn't before. I am able to recognise numbers, so this helps me with getting on the correct bus. Pedestrian crossings \- I can see the lights change brilliant.”* 

 *“The last few weeks have changed my social life completely. I have been out more than I have in the last few years. I can actually see people’s faces, in this way it is easier to talk to them and is definitely a rewarding experience.”* \[ **S1**\] 

 With the success of the RNIB trial, in 2016 OxSight was spun out from the University of Oxford to research and produce more advanced commercial products. The OxSight PRISM and CRYSTAL glasses are a result of this further development and offer improved image enhancement features over the earlier models; see images below: 









 These glasses continue to allow users who are registered as blind the ability to see again and gain more freedom in everyday life by increasing users’ field of vision from 5\-10 degrees to 68 degrees. \[ **S2**\] Testimonials from users demonstrate these freedoms: 

 *“Beyond my schoolwork, I use the glasses in my free time, say if I was watching TV or playing a console. I find using them watching TV 10 times more easier than using them without watching TV because it makes me able to see the whole screen…I’m not sure how I would live without the OXSIGHT CRYSTAL in my life…it’s just freedom to be able to see properly and how wonderful it is to have my vision back”* 

 *“When I go cycling I take the glasses with me, so that if we stop to see a particular view, I can put them on…and see what my husband is seeing…a building in the distance or flowers…without CRYSTAL glasses I would have fewer opportunities in my life.”* 

 *“It’s got enormous potential because already a lot of people are finding – and people with much worse vision \[than me\] – that they are going from being able to see almost nothing to see really quite a lot. It’s quite life\-changing in that respect.”* \[ **S2**\] 

 In 2019 OxSight products PRISM and CRYSTAL were awarded the “Tried and Tested” certification by the RNIB – the first wearable technology to be awarded this accolade. The presence of the RNIB “Tried and Tested” logo on OxSight’s products and websites indicates to blind and partially sighted people that OxSight’s products are accessible and usable; it demonstrates OxSight’s commitment to inclusivity and enables customers to make an informed choice. The certification also validates that the glasses have been rigorously tested against RNIB guidelines. \[ **S3**\] 

 A third product, ONYX, is being trialled specifically targeting central vision loss, commonly attributed to macular conditions. However, sales of the new products have been disrupted by COVID\-19. Despite the disruption, the CEO of OxSight stated: “The feedback we’ve received is that ONYX is life\-changing and gives people back their independence. To people with degenerative eye disease, that is invaluable.” Further to this, CEO of the Macular Society noted: “Recently, our members have been trialling OxSight’s new smart glasses – ONYX – and we have had positive feedback about their potential to make a difference to the everyday lives of those living with sight loss.” In these macular trials, 100% of users reported that facial detection was improved, and 75% said they could read better whilst wearing them. \[ **S4**\] 

###  *Economic Impact – the creation of OxSight and product sales* 

 The spin\-out company OxSight Ltd. was created in 2016 to further research into using wearable technologies to improve people’s lives as a result of the success of the \(RNIB\) “Smart Glasses” clinical trial. The company is currently valued at GBP40,000,000 and has raised GBP7,200,000 in investment, with 43 staff \(headcount: 43\) in offices in Oxford, London, Hangzhou, and now India. By 31 July 2020 **\[text removed for publication\]** units had been sold: **\[text removed for publication\]**. Revenue from the sales of the glasses constitute **\[text removed for publication\]**. \[ **S5**\] The first two CE certified commercial products PRISM and CRYSTAL were released in 2018 into EU, Asian, and South American markets aimed at those with tunnel vision. \[ **S6**\] 

###  *Impact on product design \- algorithms in Huawei flagship smartphones commercially available* 

 Beyond OxSight, Prof. Torr’s open source algorithms in computer vision and AI \[ **R1**\] have been implemented in Huawei’s Mate 10 flagship phone and the Honor V10 to demonstrate “AI Selfie: Brilliant Bokeh, perfect portraits” which enhances the photos taken by the cameras in these phones. The research website set up to distribute the open source code and report findings has been visited 17,923 times. \[ **S7**\] As of 2018, Prof. Torr’s algorithms have featured in more than 17,000,000 active phones from across the Huawei Mate 10 series \(Lite, Mate, and Pro models, accounting for 5.9% of all Huawei smartphones sold in 2018\). In 2018 Huawei was the fifth most used smartphone brand in the world, with a market share of 8.5%, totalling 288,200,000 active devices in the world and 43.6% of the Chinese smartphone market. \[ **S8**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Misdiagnosis and undertreatment of chronic diseases places huge burdens on developing countries. Five African and Brazilian randomised trials by UEA researchers demonstrated that clinical decision tools and health care worker training significantly improved patients’ care and health, and established pioneering nurse\-led antiretroviral treatment \(ART\) for HIV in South Africa. The Practical Approach to Care Kit \(PACK\), incorporating these interventions, was delivered to all 3500 government clinics in South Africa \(population 59 million\), throughout Ethiopia \(population 112 million\), and in three regions of Nigeria. Since 2014 >12,000 health workers received PACK training and >1.9 million South Africans started nurse\-led ART, improving the health and saving the lives of millions. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Chronic diseases like tuberculosis, HIV, asthma, diabetes and hypertension are common, but often undetected, misdiagnosed and undertreated, in low and middle income countries, largely because frontline health workers lack the requisite clinical skills. In most of those countries, policies, guidelines and training typically focus on single diseases, undermining comprehensive primary care. These defects in the quality of primary health care harm the health of hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and overload already struggling health systems with severe illness and costs. 

 **2.1 Practical Approach to Lung Health in South Africa \(PALSA\)** 

 Since 2000, UEA researchers \(Bachmann, Barton and Murdoch\) have collaborated with the University of Cape Town’s Knowledge Translation Unit \(KTU\) to show that educational interventions, developed incrementally by KTU, continued to improve primary health care in low and middle income countries. This started with development of the **PALSA \(Practical Approach to Lung Health in South Africa\)** clinical guidelines and training on integrated care of tuberculosis and lung diseases, working with the World Health Organisation. PALSA guidelines used algorithmic flow charts guiding health workers to make accurate diagnoses and prescribe effective treatments, building on national policies and evidence of effectiveness. Training to use the guideline was delivered iteratively to health workers at their workplaces by KTU\-trained health ministry trainers, enabling delivery at scale. Our randomised trial showed in 2005 that PALSA increased diagnosis of tuberculosis \(by 72%\), asthma treatment \(by 90%\) and emergency referrals \(by 159%\) \[3.1\], and was cost effective. 

 **2.2. PALSA PLUS** 

 **PALSA PLUS** expanded PALSA to cover HIV, AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. Our randomised trial of PALSA PLUS showed in 2011 that it increased the diagnosis of tuberculosis by South African primary care nurses by 28%, and appropriate treatment of HIV by 17% \[3.2\]. 

 **2.3 Primary Care 101** **and** **Practical Approach to Care Kit \(PACK\)** 

 PALSA PLUS guidelines and training were expanded to cover diabetes, hypertension and depression. This intervention \- **Primary Care 101** \- was evaluated with a randomised trial which in 2016 demonstrated that it intensified treatments of diabetes by 68% in obese participants, hypertension by 44%, and cardiovascular disease by 176% \[3.3\]. 

 **PACK** **Global** was the international version of Primary Care 101, delivered at scale in Brazil, Nigeria and Ethiopia. Our randomised trial of **PACK Adult Brazil** showed in 2019 that PACK improved testing and treatment for respiratory disease \[3.4, PI Bachmann\].  The PC101 and PACK Brazil trials thus supported large scale delivery of PACK in low and middle income countries beyond South Africa. 

 **2.4 Nurse\-led initiation and monitoring of antiretroviral treatment \(ART\)** 

 **STRETCH \(Streamlining Tasks and Roles to Expand Treatment and Care for HIV\)**, was a package of guidelines, training and primary care reorganisation, enabling nurses to take over ART prescribing from doctors in South Africa. Our randomised trial of 15,500 patients with HIV showed in 2012 that nurse\-led ART, supported by STRETCH, improved patients’ health and was safe \[3.5, co\-PI Bachmann\].  Our parallel economic evaluation showed that STRETCH was cost\-effective, and affordable by other middle income countries. Our cohort study of ART rollout in South Africa showed in 2015 that ART halved tuberculosis incidence \[3.6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our REF2014 impact case study described how, in South Africa until 2013, our research led to delivery of PALSA, PALSA PLUS and Primary Care 101 \[2.1\-2.3\], and enabled nationwide expansion of antiretroviral treatment for HIV based on STRETCH \[2.4\]. Since 2014, impact has evolved and expanded. The previous four interventions were incorporated into PACK, which was further developed and delivered throughout South Africa and internationally \[5.1\-5.7\], while ART expansion continued in South Africa \[5.8\]. 

 **4.1 From Primary Care 101 to PACK in South Africa** 

 Building on our evidence that Primary Care 101 guidelines and training, and their predecessors, led to improved management of TB, HIV, respiratory disease, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, KTU developed Primary Care 101 into a comprehensive clinical decision support tool called PACK Adult \(also called Adult Primary Care \(APC\)\) \[5.1,5.2\]. PACK Adult and APC now cover the commonest and most important adult conditions, including 40 symptoms, and 20 communicable and non\-communicable diseases. In 2015 the South African National Department of Health launched its Ideal Clinic programme, based on PACK and APC, aiming to integrate and strengthen chronic disease management in all 3500 primary care clinics in the country. These clinics are the main source of health care for 50 million South Africans without health insurance. Evidence that a clinic uses PACK or APC is an Ideal Clinic audit standard \[5.2\]. Four South African nursing schools and three medical schools added PACK to their undergraduate curricula since 2014 \[5.1\]. 

 **4.2 PACK extended to Brazil, Nigeria and Ethiopia** 

 KTU adapted PACK for international dissemination. PACK Global Adult is the prototype, which is then adapted for each country. KTU updates the guides annually, using the latest evidence about accurate diagnosis and effective treatment \(supported by the BMJ Evidence Centre\). By 2020, over 185,000 guides had been distributed and 30,000 health workers trained in 6 countries, \(including >12,000 trained and 3 new countries involved since 2014\) \[5.1\]. 

 Since 2015, PACK Global Adult has been marketed internationally to government and private providers, in partnership with BMJ Publishing Group. PACK Global Adult is delivered to each country through a comprehensive localisation package which includes: i\) PACK Adult Guide \(mentoring local partners to adapt content to match local policies and priorities, with annual updating\), ii\) training \(mentoring to adapt training methods\), iii\) health system strengthening, and iv\) monitoring and evaluation \[5.4\-5.6\]. PACK Adult was implemented, through training and dissemination of materials, in 52 clinics in 3 Nigerian states from 2016 to 2018, with World Bank funding \[5.4\].  In 2018 PACK Adult was adapted for Ethiopia, and 100 master trainers from the Ethiopian Ministry of Health were trained; they are currently training frontline primary care workers in every primary care facility in all 9 regions of the country \[5.5\]. PACK Adult was first rolled out as a randomised controlled trial in the Brazilian city of Florianopolis in 2016, and in 2018 was extended to cover the whole city of 480,000 residents \[5.6, 5.7\]. Expansion of PACK Adult Brazil to all of Brazil is currently being negotiated, although disrupted by COVID\-19. 

 Using PACK Adult principles, PACK Child guidelines and materials were written, training was piloted and optimised in South Africa from 2017\-2019, and planning for province\- and nationwide implementation are under way. PACK Adolescent guidelines have been written, and piloting of training begins in 2021. Using this experience, Bachmann is also working with UK and East African researchers, and health ministries, on a randomised trial and upscaling of integrated primary care for HIV, diabetes and hypertension in Uganda and Tanzania, which began in 2020. Impact from this research is expected after 2020. 

 **4.3 Further expansion of antiretroviral treatment in South Africa** 

 Continuing the impact of the 2010 STRETCH trial of nurse initiation and monitoring of antiretroviral treatment \(ART\) \[2.3\], ART continues to expand in South African, reaching 5.2 million people by 2019, with over 1.9 million having started ART since 2014 \[5.8\]. 

 **4.4 Health impact** 

 The health impact of these programmes on African and Brazilian populations is likely to be huge. Independent research has shown that implementation of Primary Care 101 guidelines in South Africa would reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease and diabetes by 7.5 disability adjusted life years \(DALYs\) per 1000 population per year and would save USD24,902 per DALY gained \[5.3\]. 

 Almost everyone currently receiving ART in South Africa would eventually die of AIDS without it. Our cohort study \(Fairall LR, Bachmann MO, Louwagie G, et al, 2007\), completed before and justifying the STRETCH trial, used data from a province\-wide government HIV programme and rigorous causal modelling, to estimate that ART reduced the risk of death by 86%. This means that >4.4 million lives would be saved \(85% of 5.2 million\), including >1.6 million who started ART since 2014 \(85% of 1.9 million\). Tuberculosis incidence in South Africa decreased by about 177,000 cases per year from 2014 to 2019 \[5.9\], primarily due to ART expansion.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Loman’s \(UoB\) development of rapid whole genomic sequencing methods, including portable sequencing tools, laboratory methods and open\-source bioinformatic software, have transformed the management of **infectious** **disease in both developed and developing countries**, improving identification of transmission pathways, evolution of pathogens and sites of persistence. Used in the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, genome sequencing **shortened the length of the epidemic reducing mortality, morbidity, and economic loss**. The approach was then applied to other diseases and notably the SARS\-CoV\-2 pandemic. The benefits led to **changes in policy and practice within the World Health Organization** to **improve rapid sharing** of sequence data which has proved critical in the identification of SARS\-CoV\-2 variants and **influenced containment policies** in the UK.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Whole</ins> <ins>g</ins><ins>enome</ins> <ins>s</ins><ins>equence data for epidemiological investigations</ins> 

 From 2008 to 2014, UoB researchers were the first to recognise and describe the potential for **using whole\-genome sequence \(WGS\) data during outbreak investigations**. In 2008, the group investigated a hospital outbreak of a severe multiple\-drug resistant strain \(Acinetobacter\) and determined that cases were imported by military personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and transmitted to NHS patients in intensive care units \[R1\]. That was followed by the first large\-scale demonstration of whole\-genome sequencing to investigate a large outbreak of *Escherichia coli* in Europe which led to an intensive crowd\-sourced effort to analyse the genomic sequence to determine its source: the group’s investigations determined that the *E. coli* was most likely a human\-circulating strain rather than the more usual zoonotic source \[R2\]. In both cases, control of the outbreaks was improved by knowing the transmission pathways. 

 <ins>Technological development in support of real</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>time outbreak detection</ins> 

 Due to equipment limitations, early investigations using WGS were done mainly in well\-equipped labs in a handful of genome centres worldwide. However, by 2014, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequence platform had become available which enabled rapid analysis of sequence data in the field. The ‘pocket sequencer’ weighs <100 grams, costs $1000 and can be powered through the USB port of a standard laptop. UoB researchers became the first to generate and publish data of any type from this technology \(June 2014\) and collaboratively worked with Oxford Nanopore Technologies \(a private UK company\) to develop laboratory methods and software for the platform as well as testing and providing feedback on products. 

 The group tested the device on a large hospital outbreak of *Salmonella* in Birmingham as an early example of **real\-time genomic epidemiology** \[R3\] and developed prototype bioinformatics and laboratory methods to demonstrate how the MinION and software might be used in outbreaks of infectious disease. The study highlighted the need to develop bespoke bioinformatics to analyse the long, error\-prone sequences generated by the MinION platform. To address this need, Loman developed an open\-source software tool, Poretools, to process raw nanopore data \[R4\]. Loman then worked with Jared Simpson \(Ontario Institute of Cancer Research\) to develop the nanopolish approach to assemble a genome from nanopore MinION data, providing the **first demonstration of a complete **de novo** assembly of a microbial genome** \( *Escherichia coli* K\-12 MG1655\) \[R5\]. 

 <ins>R</ins><ins>eal\-time outbreak detection and analysis</ins> <ins>in the field</ins> 

 Loman rapidly recognised that portable nanopore sequencing could have profound benefits for management of infectious diseases globally, resulting in a ‘lab\-in\-a\-suitcase’ suitable for ‘pop\-up’ WGS at the site of disease outbreaks, especially in countries where storing and shipping samples for analysis was not possible. To meet this aim, the group developed the first complete protocol for sequencing RNA viruses \(Ebola and Zika\) directly from clinical samples using nanopore technology \[R6, R7\]. This work included bioinformatics analysis tools which **enabled very accurate sequences to be obtained from this previously noisy technology for the first time**. Deployment of ‘pop\-up’ sequencing laboratories \(Figure 1\) was first used in the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, delivering genome sequencing data in as little as 18 hours to enable field epidemiologists to identify and break transmission chains. 





 **Figure 1.** ‘Lab\-in\-a\-suitcase’ deployed to Conakry, Guinea in 2015 by Dr Joshua Quick \(left\). Portable genome sequencing facility in Nongo, Guinea in 2016 \(right\). 

 <ins>Broader applications of the real\-time WGS approach</ins> 

 Following work on Ebola and Zika, Loman and team have continued to develop technologies, models and processes for epidemiological investigation of outbreaks through the realisation of **real\-time, pathogen genome sequencing and rapid open data sharing**. The sequencing approach they invented, Primal Scheme and PrimalSeq \[R7\], has been used to analyse many other infectious diseases \(including Yellow Fever, dengue, rabies, polio, influenza, West Nile Virus and chikungunya\). Crucially, the underpinning approaches have been used by Loman and others to provide cost\-effective means for tracking the evolution of SARS\-CoV\-2 \[R8\]. 

 **Key Findings:** 

 **KF1:** Whole genome sequencing can provide a powerful tool to investigate outbreaks of disease \(R1, R2, R5, R8\). 

 **KF2:** The use of real\-time nanopore sequencing is transformative in providing timely data for decision making to control infectious disease transmission but requires bespoke bioinformatics software to improve the accuracy of real\-time nanopore sequencing \(R3, R4, R7\). 

 **KF3:** The combination of portable hardware plus open\-source software for real\-time analysis of viruses in patient samples in disease outbreaks can inform disease control decisions \(R6, R7\). 

 **KF4:** Real\-time genome sequencing accompanied with rapid data sharing has become a standard approach for monitoring the transmission of infectious disease across both the developed and developing world \(R6, R7, R8\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Impact on professional practice via the management of outbreaks</ins> 

 The use of real\-time genomic epidemiology, based on KF1–KF4, has transformed the way that outbreaks of **infectious** **disease are controlled in developed and developing countries**. The approach enables epidemiologists to accurately track transmission routes in real\-time and then intercept the chain to prevent further transmission of the virus. As such, **professional practice has been influenced by the research** with genome sequencing being used routinely during large outbreaks of national or international concern that constitute public health emergencies. This case study provides an example from both developing and developed countries. 

 *1. Example from developing countries: Ebola and West Africa* 

 The **control of the 2014–2016 West African Ebola epidemic was transformed** by the use of real\-time whole genome sequencing \[KF2, KF3\], which was well suited to the epidemic of Ebola which demanded rapid case detection followed by contact tracing. The approach facilitated “rapid containment of the flare\-up\[s\]” ultimately shortening the epidemic therefore bringing both **public health and economic benefits** to the region \[EV1\]. 

 By sharing the genome sequence data produced directly with outbreak responders \(KF4\), the **policy and practice of the World Health Organization \(WHO\) was changed** \[EV2\]. The data informed epidemiological studies which were used to infer the source of new chains of transmission of Ebola in newly affected or previously ‘cured’ regions \[EV3\]. Fundamentally, the data helped to target outbreak response resource, for example surveillance and emergency response measures \[EV1\]. As testified by a technical officer of the WHO: 

 The team were able to rapidly establish in\-country sequencing capacity \[…\] genomic data generated within 72hrs was used to rapidly identify survivor associated flare\-up, expand the understanding of transmission chains and used to exclude new introductions of the virus during the outbreak. \[EV2\] 

 There were particular challenges in West Africa due to the geographical spread of the disease which had led to uncertainty on the origin of new cases. However, genome sequencing was able to distinguish between sporadic cases and established chains of transmission \[EV3\]. Examples are provided in the WHO weekly situation reports: 

 The case from Conakry \[…\] is not a known contact of a previous case, and genomic analyses suggest he was not infected with the strain of Ebola virus responsible for the most recent cases in Conakry and Forecariah. \[EV3\] 

 The first case identified from Forecariah, \[…\] genomic analyses suggest she is part of the same chain of transmission — the Ratoma chain — as the 4 cases that were reported from the same subprefecture in Forecariah during the week. \[EV3\] 

 Sequencing also contributed to detection of novel routes of transmission and viral persistence \(e.g. the potential for breastmilk to transmit Ebola from mother to child\). However, this is best evidenced by the detection of active virus in a survivor’s seminal fluid \(over 500 days after the initial infection\) which caused a new cluster of cases in Guinea, more than a year after the previous last case \[EV4\]. Such findings focused the epidemiological response and are **now included in WHO guidance** for clinical care for survivors of Ebola virus disease: 

 Recent data suggest that Ebola virus can persist in the semen of males for a year or more after acute infection \[…\] Consequently, all EVD survivors and their sexual partners should receive counselling to ensure safe sex practices until their semen has been determined to be free of Ebola virus. \[EV4\] 

 The WHO now recognise that “Pathogen genetic sequencing data is an increasingly valuable source of information to understand and control outbreaks of infectious disease” \[EV5\] and has used the approach \[KF2, KF3\] to tackle other serious outbreaks of priority diseases across the world, including the Zika public health emergency in South America during 2016, a severe Yellow Fever outbreak in Brazil in 2017–2018 and to determine the origin of Lassa fever cases in Nigeria in 2017 \[EV5\]. Furthermore, the methods and protocols developed have been begun to be used more widely for diverse infectious diseases including rabies, polio, African Swine Fever, TB, malaria, responsible for >2m deaths/year globally \[e.g., EV6\]. 

 *2. Example from a developed country: SARS\-CoV2 and the UK: Identification of variants* 

 KF4 has been utilised to analyse the evolution of strains of SARS\-CoV2 from its first detection in late 2019 \[R8\]. Whilst early evolution of the virus prompted little alarm, in **December 2020 a new strain of SARS\-CoV2 was identified which was of concern to parliamentarians and influenced policy** to contain the new threat. 

 The novel SARS\-CoV2 ‘Kent’ variant was identified in Dec 2020, using the approaches in KF3 and KF4, and was presented in a series of technical briefing documents \[EV7\]. These reports led to Parliament being briefed by the Health Secretary on the 14 December 2020 \[EV8i\] with the subsequent press conference led by the Prime Minister to outline a **reversal in planned policy** to relax restrictions on travel and group meetings planned for the 5 days around Christmas 2020 \[EV8ii\]. The data then underpinned planning conducted in December 2020 for the 3<sup>rd</sup> national lockdown in the UK in 2021: 

 Over the past few days, thanks to our world\-class genomic capability in the UK, we have identified a new variant of coronavirus, which may be associated with the faster spread in the south\-east of England. Initial analysis suggests that this variant is growing faster than the existing variants. \[…\] We have notified the World Health Organisation about this new variant \[…\]. \[EV8i\] 

 The UK has by far the best genomic sequencing ability in the world, which means we’re better able to identify new strains like this than any other country \[…\]. Given the early evidence we have on this new variant of the virus, the potential risk it poses, it is with a very heavy heart, I must tell you, we cannot continue with Christmas as planned. \[EV8ii\] 

 The contribution of Loman in helping to contain the spread of the virus was praised by the executive director of COG\-UK \(COVID\-19 Genomics UK\) in a letter addressed to the Vice Chancellor of the University of Birmingham: 

 I am writing to acknowledge and extend my heartfelt gratitude for the support that the University of Birmingham has provided to the \[…\] COG\-UK consortium since its inception, a year ago this week. The work undertaken by your colleagues, including Professor Nick Loman and his team, has been vital to the success of the consortium and our contributions to the pandemic response in the UK and beyond.  \[…\] The recent emergence of SARS\-CoV\-2 variants has brought the work of all individuals and organisations involved in COG\-UK to wider attention. This work will likely remain vital for some time to come as we continue to monitor for variants as the vaccination campaign proceeds \[EV9\] 

 <ins>Real\-time</ins> <ins>WGS</ins> <ins>has changed</ins> <ins>p</ins><ins>olicy and practice of the World Health Organi</ins><ins>z</ins><ins>ation</ins><ins>:</ins> 

 Following the proven use of genome sequencing in West Africa, the **practices of the World Health Organization were changed** by the adoption of an open\-data policy. From 2016, the WHO has recommended that data should be shared within 21 days of sequence generation. This underlined the importance and relevance of genomic datasets to outbreak response. The WHO code of conduct now states: 

 In each new outbreak or new transmission season genetic sequence data \[…\] should be made publicly available. In particular the first set of sequences providing crucial information on the pathogen, genotype, lineage, and strain\(s\) causing the outbreak which may inform on the origin \[…\] as well as the choice of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, should be generated and shared as rapidly as possible. \[EV5\] 

 The revised code of conduct has made the sharing of data a crucial tool in responding to new variants of SARS\-CoV2 with over 500,000 genomes shared by 31 December 2020: 

 Sharing of full genome sequences is facilitating detailed analyses by partners \[…\]. Genomic data of the SARS\-CoV\-2 VOC 202012/01 and 501Y.V2 variants has been shared by the national authorities and uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data \[…\] and genomic surveillance of the virus continues, globally. \[EV10\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at DMU into the design of clinically meaningful and technically robust quality measures for NHS maternity and perinatal services in Britain has led to: \(1\) better care outcomes for women and babies, including reductions in maternal haemorrhage and 3rd/4th degree tear rates, \(2\) improved maternity data capture and quality for comparative purposes nationally and internationally, \(3\) increased awareness of unexplained geographical variation in maternity care outcomes, which has driven quality improvement strategies, \(4\) integration of research\-based clinical measures into data strategies of the NHS and changes to regulatory and policy processes for maternity care.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Most women giving birth in the UK receive a safe, effective service. However, the stillbirth rate is higher in the UK than in many European countries. There is evidence of significant variation in maternity care outcomes between NHS Trusts in different regions, which has led to concerns over a postcode care lottery for women and babies. 

 Research led by Harris at DMU has used novel methods to identify geographical variations in maternal and perinatal care so that unwarranted variation can be investigated and reduced. This work involved designing clinically relevant measures and being at the forefront of linking established datasets to report maternal and neonatal outcomes. Her studies were carried out as part of the GBP4,000,000 National Maternity and Perinatal Audit \(NMPA\), funded by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership and the first comparative analysis of maternity care across England, Scotland and Wales, for which Harris is Senior Clinical Lead. Novel clinical measures were derived from the use of explicit criteria \(validity, fairness, sufficient statistical power, adequate technical specification\) and balanced to cover various dimensions of care. These methodological approaches were peer reviewed through consultation with clinical researchers and the Royal Colleges; they underpinned the publication of peer\-reviewed clinical evaluations and technical studies, and a cohort study of 276,766 women across 87 NHS Trusts to determine the risk of complicated birth, published in *The BMJ* \[R1\]. 

 In August 2017 the first evaluation of how the NHS delivers maternity care was published \[R2\]. New measures were designed to evaluate variations in the availability, configuration and staffing of services; Harris led on identifying and defining the measures. Significant variation was found in the types of maternity units available to women, with only a fifth of Trusts/​Boards offering the full range of birth settings and there was a wide variation in numbers of beds per midwife. The results provided a baseline for the reconfiguration of services in the wake of government maternity care reviews in England, Scotland and Wales. A second organisational evaluation \[R3\], in 2019, revealed that data from the first study had been used to improve clinical practice and the organisation of care. 

 The first evaluation of clinical outcomes was published in November 2017, based on 696,738 births between April 2015 and March 2016 \[R4\]. Representing the largest ever study of the state of maternity care in Britain, it presented 16 clinical measures of maternity and perinatal care, with each evaluated for feasibility, quality and statistical power. Rates of measures were adjusted for risk factors, such as age and ethnicity. For the first time the study, led by Harris, identified outliers, i.e. units with clinical outcomes outside of the expected range. Key findings, which led to improvements in data collection, quality assurance processes and improvements in care, included: 

-  Significant unexplained variation in rates for maternity process and outcome measures. 

-  Women were twice as likely to suffer postpartum haemorrhage \(PPH\) and severe tears during childbirth in some hospitals. 

-  Wide variation in proportion of babies receiving skin\-to\-skin contact within their first hour. 

-  Significant issues in measuring outcomes due to poor quality data and data missingness. 

 A number of peer\-reviewed research reports were published in 2019/2020 \(and are available at www.nmpa.org.uk\). One of these publications established the feasibility of linking maternity data with intensive care data for the first time, finding that women with a higher BMI, an older age at birth or of black ethnic origin are more likely to require admission to intensive care \[R5\]. Harris led on identifying and defining the clinically relevant measures, which linkage of the datasets made possible. These findings were used to influence the development of new definitions to improve data gathering. The second clinical report, based on 728,620 births from April 2016 to March 2017, was published in September 2019 and included three new neonatal clinical measures and one composite measure: Birth Without Intervention \[R6\]. Harris led on defining clinical measures and identifying the clinical implications of the findings. Media coverage raised awareness of the impact of obesity on maternal outcomes. 

 Further research led by Harris involved the analysis of specific elements of maternity care to further inform care improvements and health policy changes. Harris sought to improve the classification of risk of complicated birth. This study, published in *The BMJ* and shared widely on social media \(reaching an upper bound of 821,000 people on Twitter according to Altmetric\), found that parity and obstetric history are the key determinants of the risk of a complicated birth at term. It demonstrated a need for services to give greater weight to parity in determining risk \[R1\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The collection and analysis of high\-quality linked data, led by Harris at DMU \[C1\], made it possible, for the first time, to compare the care that maternity units provide to women in Britain. The evaluation, the largest of its kind, identified priorities for improvement in care, where unexplained variation in outcomes for women and babies exist, identified areas of good practice and detected gaps in policy and guidelines. Harris led on a strategy to engage the midwifery community in the findings and drive quality improvement with published articles in *Midwives*, the RCM’s magazine \(48,000 members\), and *Midwifery Matters*, and presenting at conferences. Evaluation findings are freely accessible to healthcare professionals, policymakers and members of the public via the NMPA website \(www.nmpa.org.uk\). For the first time, units in England, Scotland and Wales are comparing their risk\-adjusted findings with those of others and against the national mean to take action accordingly. 

 **\(1\) BETTER CARE OUTCOMES FOR WOMEN AND BABIES** 

 The research identified a significant percentage of NHS Trusts/​Boards as potential outliers for one of three measures \(>3 SD above the mean\): PPH \(18%\), Apgar score \(13%\), third\- or fourth\-degree perineal tear \(14%\) \[R4\]. A quarter of all Trusts/​Boards \(38 out of 155\) said they had reviewed their local data following the 2017 clinical evaluation \[R4\] and conducted case note reviews and internal audits \[C2\]. Fourteen services carried out staff training and 21 undertook formal investigations into cases or systems, demonstrating the powerful impact that the research has had on quality assurance processes to drive improvements in care \[C2\]. 

 Fifty\-one services volunteered as case studies to present the work they had done in response to the findings in R4 and the effect this has had on clinical measures. There is clear evidence from testimonials that changes in practice as a result of the research have improved care for women and babies. Northampton General Hospital reports that, following implementation of an action plan, the percentage of women experiencing a PPH of 1500ml or more was reduced by more than one\-sixth, or 0.7 percentage points, from 4.1% to 3.4% by September 2018 \[C3\]. Stockport NHS Foundation Trust implemented the Stockport Perineal Care bundle and reported a reduction in the incidence of severe perineal tears \[C4\]. Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust reported a significant improvement in PPH rates following their response to the clinical evaluation findings, which included improvements in calculating blood loss accurately, documentation and multidisciplinary training \[C4\]. 

 Data collected as part of the second organisational survey \[R3, C5\] found that NMPA data had been used to make improvements in the organisation of care within Trusts/​Boards \(59% of respondents\) in collaboration with Local Maternity Systems/​networks \(32%\). Services also used the data to inform women about their services \(15% of respondents\), to guide local audit \(50%\) and to make improvements to data \(44%\) \[C5\]. 

 **\(2\) IMPROVED MATERNITY DATA CAPTURE AND QUALITY** 

 Many services contacted Harris and other members of the research team to request additional support on how to improve the quality of their data, as a direct response to concerns around missing data that were identified through the research \[R4\]. This led to alterations in data fields in local Maternity Information Systems as well as the flow of data through the local system before reaching national initiatives like the NMPA. Data capture improved from 92% in the 2017 clinical report to 97% for the 2019 Clinical Report with a similar improvement in data capture of individual items \[R4: 11, R6: xi\]. 

 **\(3\) INCREASING AWARENESS OF UNEXPLAINED GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION IN MATERNITY CARE OUTCOMES AND EMPOWERING INTEREST GROUPS TO PUSH FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS** 

 NMPA advisory groups include third\-sector groups and members of the public; advice and support are provided by the Women and Families Involvement Group. The NMPA findings have been published in user\-friendly reports on its website, which are designed to inform women’s choices over where and how to have their baby. The website has seen 10,100 new users and more than 99,000 unique page views\[C6\]. The average time spent on the site is five minutes, with an average of six pages viewed, indicating high levels of engagement with the data. Users are predominantly based in Great Britain \(78%\) but there is significant interest from the USA \(6%\), China \(5%\) and other countries \(11%\), illustrating the data is relevant to the international maternity community. This is supported by the research literature; for example, Souter et al \(2020,  [https://doi.org/10.1097/01.AOG.0000663696.09421.af](https://doi.org/10.1097/01.AOG.0000663696.09421.af)\) have benchmarked outcome measures in a US birth cohort against those published by the NMPA. The website has seen significant spikes in visitors coinciding with the publication of key reports \(and accompanying media coverage \[C5\]\), with 200% increases in weekly traffic \[C6\]. 

 Both the 2017 and 2019 clinical reports received significant media coverage in the UK \[C5\]. Upon publication of the 2017 findings, the BBC reported on calls from the RCOG to investigate unexplained variation, quoting its president as saying: ‘We urge all maternity units to examine their own results and those of their neighbours both to identify role models and to drive quality improvement locally’ \[C5,p4\]. A *Guardian* article \[C5,p2\] highlighted a finding that fewer than one in six women who give birth every year sees the same person throughout her pregnancy and aftercare, despite promises that this should happen. It quoted a senior policy adviser at parenting charity NCT as saying that the research ‘reveals a number of problems including staffing shortages that puts safe care at risk, and postnatal care that often leaves mothers struggling alone’. 

 The clinical findings published in 2019 \[R6\] reported that the proportion of pregnant women overweight or obese had risen to more than half for the first time \(50.4%\), and increasing risk of miscarriage and stillbirths, was covered widely \[C5\]. *The* *Daily Telegraph* quoted the director of the National Obesity Forum as saying the figures were ‘hugely depressing’ and calling on the UK Government to do more to ensure the risks of a high BMI were taught to girls in schools \[C5,p5\]. The 2019 Clinical Report was widely reported across local news media to highlight regions in which there were concerns around care outcomes. For example, *Wigan Today* reported that women who give birth in Wigan were more likely than average to suffer serious blood loss; it also gave the Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust the opportunity to clarify that the Trust had bettered the national average for 10 of the 13 NMPA clinical outcome measures \[C5,p5\]. 

 **\(4\) INTEGRATION OF CLINICAL MEASURES INTO DATA STRATEGIES AND CHANGES TO MATERNITY REGULATORY AND POLICY PROCESSES** 

 Harris and the project team have worked closely with national dataset teams, regulators, clinicians and service providers to share learning related to data collection and quality. NHS England has acknowledged that the study programme acts as ‘an important benchmark for local areas, helping identify where improvements can be made, including ensuring the right staffing levels for the women and babies they care for’ \[C5\]. Crucially, three of the 16 clinical measures in R4 \(PPH of 1500ml or more, low Apgar score and third/fourth\-degree perineal tear rates\) were adopted as quality improvement metrics by NHS Digital’s Maternity Dashboard, a dataset that helps maternity teams improve their clinical outcomes, and which was set up in 2016 in response to NHS England’s ‘Better Births’ five\-year vision \[C7\]. Study findings have also influenced the development of new metrics for Version 2 of NHS Digital’s Maternity Services Dataset \(MSDS\), a patient\-level dataset that captures information about activity carried out by maternity services in England \[C8\]. Another HQIP\-funded programme is the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the UK. A November 2019 report from this enquiry endorsed the following NMPA recommendation, which was published in \[R5\]: ‘data gathering on maternal critical illness should be re\-examined and strengthened by new definitions in order to capture lessons about good care and near miss events’ \[C9\]. The research team shared its ‘outlier’ findings with the Care Quality Commission \(CQC\). As a result, CQC uses NMPA metrics in its regulatory process \[C10\]. This ensures maternity services are held accountable for their findings and called to respond as appropriate, with action or justification for results that are unexpected.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Fear of the dentist is common, affecting 30% of children in the UK and worldwide. Traditional approaches such as admission to hospital for general anaesthesia \(GA\) or sedation do not reduce child dental anxiety and are costly to the NHS. In response to this challenge, our research has transformed dental services provided for children with dental anxiety by developing a new low\-intensity psychological intervention. This intervention has been adopted widely throughout the UK with benefits for dental services \(improved attendance, reduced use of GA/sedation\) plus improved outcomes for children and parents of reduced dental anxiety and better communication.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Fear of the dentist is common, affecting 30% of children in the UK and worldwide. Children with dental anxiety experience unpleasant thoughts, feelings and symptoms and have more decayed and extracted teeth with worse quality of life than children without dental anxiety. The impacts of child dental anxiety are far reaching, causing upset for families, stress to dental professionals, and NHS costs. NHS costs include the cost of traditional approaches to managing child dental anxiety such as admission to hospital for general anaesthetics \(GA\) or sedation \(approximately £700 per patient\) plus the cost of missed appointments \(approximately £157 per lost appointment\) due to avoidance. In addition, these traditional approaches do nothing to reduce child dental anxiety in the short\- or long\-term resulting in dental anxiety being maintained into adulthood. 

 In 2012 Marshman and Baker from the University of Sheffield found a lack of psychological support available for dentally anxious patients and revealed that dental professionals struggle to manage them with limited resources and training available \[R1\]. Rodd and Marshman established that psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy \(CBT\) should be used to reduce dental anxiety in children \[R2\]. The review identified barriers to psychological interventions including the lack of psychologist\-led services for children with dental anxiety and dental professionals reluctance to undergo lengthy training to deliver psychological interventions \[R2\]. CBT is a talking therapy which requires patients and professionals to work together to tackle the patient's problems. Differing intensities of CBT have been developed from low\-intensity ‘self\-help’ approaches to higher intensity psychologist\-led therapies. 

 The research team in Sheffield developed the first ever low\-intensity CBT intervention for dental professionals to use with children and their parents \[R3\]. In 2014, the initial stage involved child patients and their parents to explore their experiences of dental anxiety \[R4\] and provided unique insights not previously described. From these insights the intervention ‘Your teeth you are in control’ was developed in 2015 using a ‘person\-based’ approach \(involving children, parents, professionals, and Patient/Public Involvement \(PPI\) representatives\) based on the Five Areas model of CBT. The intervention involved children and dental professionals working through a series of CBT\-based activities together to change children's unhelpful thoughts \(e.g. 'something will go wrong'\), behaviours \(e.g. cancelling appointments\), physical symptoms \(e.g. sweating\), feelings \(e.g. embarrassment, anger\) and situational factors \(e.g. poor patient\-dentist communication\) that maintain dental anxiety. One activity children suggested which was incorporated into the intervention was a ‘message to dentist’ children write to communicate with the dental professional. 

 In 2016 we evaluated the use of the intervention with 48 patients from two dental settings \(one dental hospital and one community dental clinic\) and found 86% engaged with the intervention which reduced child dental anxiety in 95% of patients, with a significant, large reduction in dental anxiety and improvement in quality of life. The intervention was acceptable to children, parents, and dental professionals \(n=25\) \[R4\]. Based on the findings, resources were developed by the research team for parents and dental professionals including an online training package. 

 The research was principally funded by the National Institute for Health Research.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Sheffield research has resulted in changes to the way **dental services across the UK** treat child patients with dental anxiety. This research led to the creation of a low intensity CBT intervention, ‘Your teeth you are in control’, resulting in improvements in children’s health and wellbeing including reduced dental anxiety in the short\- and long\-term following use of the intervention. These impacts have been realised through the adoption of this intervention by community dental services, dental hospitals and dental practices and has transformed the way they provide dental care for children with dental anxiety. 

 Benefits for dental services and dental professionals 

 The benefits to dental services are patient\-related and financial, including improved attendance rates, reduced demand for GA and sedation services, reduced need for referrals to secondary care and improved patient experiences and outcomes \[S1\]. A service evaluation found improved attendance when the full intervention was delivered. There was a reduction in the number of children not being taken to their follow\-up appointments \(the ‘was not brought’ \(WNB\) rate\) of 10% with the intervention compared to 26% without the intervention. When a brief version of the intervention was delivered to all new patients the WNB rate for new patient appointments fell by 4% \[S2\]. Each patient assessment appointment missed costs the NHS £157. There was also a reduction in GA uptake \(80% of the patients were referred for a GA, but only 15% required it\). This is important as a GA brings with it risks of morbidity, mortality, distress for the child and their family plus they do not reduce dental anxiety long\-term and are costly to the NHS \[S2\]. 

 Benefits of the intervention for dental professionals include improved communication with patients, understanding of children’s dental anxiety and job satisfaction \[S1\] as illustrated by this quote, *“much better communication with the anxious child. It develops a better sense of trust between patients and the dental team which is rewarding.”* 

 Feedback from dental students using the intervention found it improved their patient management skills and reduced their anticipatory anxiety at treating children \[S2\]. 

 Service delivery and intervention implementation 

 Since 2016, the team from the University of Sheffield have delivered 28 training events in the use of the intervention, mainly in the UK \(by community dental services, branches of the British Society of Paediatric Dentistry \(BSPD\) and British Dental Association \(BDA\)\) reaching over 1,000 dental professionals \[S3\]. Feedback found 90% of dental professionals who attended the training felt they would alter their clinical practice. 

 The contribution of this intervention to transforming the dental care for children with dental anxiety has been recognised by two endorsements. The BSPD endorsed and approved the intervention, the past President said *“To have the tool available for use in clinical dental practice is empowering \- for our patients and their families, and the clinical team…The name says it all – they ‘are in control”* \[S4\] *.* The charity Anxiety UK has also recommended the intervention \[S5\]. 

 Internationally, the team have responded to requests from paediatric dentists to collaborate to translate the intervention into nine languages \[S1\] for use in ten countries. 

 The intervention has been incorporated into the Dental Anxiety Management Pathway of NHS England Central Midlands and the number of services using it is increasing rapidly. It is being used in 18 of the 70 community dental services and 9 of the 19 dental hospitals across the UK so far. The intervention is also being incorporated into the national guidelines for health services for children and young people in Norway \[S1, S6\]. 

 In addition, eight dental schools have revised their curricula to include teaching of the intervention to undergraduate and postgraduate dental students \[S7\]. Feedback from students using this intervention: improves their confidence in talking to children; improves their ability to assess their patient’s level of dental anxiety; provides practical tips for ways to support children and helps them anticipate problems that may occur during treatment \[S7\]. 

 The intervention includes resources for children, parents, and dental professionals. These resources are available in two formats: paper\-based and online. The paper\-based resources are available to purchase at cost from the School of Clinical Dentistry online shop. There is no charge for online access. 

 Dental professionals, practices and services have purchased \[S8\]: 

-  2,465 guides for children 

-  5,140 message to dentist proformas 

-  1,835 resources for parents 

-  444 resources for dental professionals 

 The resources can be accessed via two websites. The first website is the dental section of the  [<ins>Living Life</ins> <ins>To</ins> <ins>The Full</ins>](https://dental.llttf.com/) website hosted by our collaborators \[S8\] who are internationally recognized for their work publishing low\-intensity CBT interventions. Between January 2017 and October 2020 there have been 373 registrations to this website. Subsequently,  [<ins>a second website</ins>](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dentalschool/research/person-centred-population/child-dental-anxiety), hosted by the University of Sheffield, was published providing information on research, links to the online training and direct access to the resources. 

 The intervention has been recognised by the following awards: 

-  BDA Community Dental Service group \- 1st prize for service improvement 2016. 

-  British Medical Association Patient Information Award – highly commended and shortlisted for children award 2017. 

-  Yorkshire & Humber Academic Health Science Network – Best Patient Driven Innovation Award 2018 \[S9\] 

 In October 2020, Professor Helen Rodd was awarded Member of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen’s belated birthday honours in recognition of her work to help children with dental anxiety in dental services throughout the UK. 

 Benefit to patients, parents, and the public 

 The main benefits for children include decreased levels of dental anxiety which were sustained following the use of the intervention. In 2017 a subsequent follow\-up of 22 children after 12\-18 months found 91% felt better about visiting the dentist showing the longer\-term benefits \[S10\]. 

 Service evaluations have been conducted in one general dental practice, two dental hospitals and three community dental services to date involving 240 child patients. The general dental practice, which is in a very deprived area of London, used the intervention with 84 children and found a statistically significant reduction in child dental anxiety \[S10\]. 

 Feedback from parents as part of the service evaluations \[S2\] was positive with 58% reporting the brief intervention had a positive effect on their child prior to their appointment. One parent said *“from start to finish the whole process of coming to* the *dental hospital and using the Your Teeth You Are In Control approach with my daughter has been amazing and has changed our lives”.*

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Obesity is major global health concern and food product reformulation is a core mitigation strategy. Novel methodology, developed at the University of Bristol, has been important in supporting product reformulation across the multi\-billion\-pound food manufacturer sector, by quantifying the extent to which foods are expected to stave off hunger \(expected satiety\) and deliver fullness \(expected satiation\). The ‘Bristol Satiety Toolkit’ has been used in product reformulation initiatives to reduce calorie intake by nine food manufacturers, including global leaders Nestlé, Mars Wrigley and Unilever. The toolkit was successfully used by Nestlé to reformulate ready meals commercialized under the global Lean Cuisine brand which is worth 30% of Nestlé’s USD 2.6 billion prepared food sales in the USA. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Since 1975, obesity has nearly tripled globally, leading to increases in a range of noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, and some cancers. Living in an ‘obesogenic environment’, one that promotes overeating, is often proposed as a driver of the global obesity crisis. In the UK and elsewhere, a core mitigation strategy has been voluntary or mandated commercial food ‘reformulation’ – the redesign of products in ways that reduce calorie intake. Research carried out by the University of Bristol \(UoB\) Nutrition and Behaviour Unit has been key in supporting product reformulation. Work by Prof Brunstrom and Dr Ferriday seeks to understand our interaction with our food environment, how certain foods and meals promote overeating and why certain individuals are more likely to eat in excess. 

 Prior experience with a food influences the extent to which it promotes fullness \(satiation\) after it has been consumed. Prof Jeff Brunstrom was interested in these learned controls of food intake and reasoned that evidence for learning might be exposed in beliefs about appropriate portion size before a meal begins. To explore this idea, his research group developed psychophysical methods that quantify the **expected satiation** \(anticipated fullness\) and **expected satiety** \(anticipated relief from hunger\) of commonly consumed foods. Using bespoke software, consumers were able to morph the size of a food on a screen. In so doing, it was possible to obtain precise estimates of expected satiety and satiation and, in turn, identify specific product reformulations \(e.g., reductions in portion size, calories or fat\) that ensure consumer acceptance is preserved. This work, funded by food manufacturer Kraft Foods \[i\], represented the first of its kind and it demonstrated that: a\) humans form and can express these expectations; b\) they can be precisely quantified and importantly, c\) that product reformulation is acceptable to consumers \[1\]. 

 BBSRC funding \[ii\] to further progress these methods enabled Brunstrom, working with Ferriday, to develop a portion\-selection tool that can be used to animate the presentation of different food portions on a computer screen. This work also showed that expected satiety and satiation influence meal size \[2,3\] and that they are learned and can be manipulated over time \[1 and ii\]. In 2012, Brunstrom and Ferriday applied these methods in two BBSRC projects, 50% funded by Nestlé \[iii and iv\], demonstrating that these expectations can be affected by modern food processing methods and eating rate \[4\]. 

 Extending this research, Brunstrom and Ferriday showed that tools for assessing expected satiety and expected satiation can also be used to explore the effects of repeated exposure to ‘processed’ foods \[5\]. A key finding was that these expectations play a major role in food choice \[2\]. This discovery formed the basis of involvement in an EU\-FP7 project \(Nudge\-it\) \[v\] and led to publications demonstrating the relative importance of satiety expectations alongside other predictors of food choice. This was achieved by developing a ‘consumer expectations toolbox’ that incorporates other measures \(e.g., healthiness and palatability\) alongside assessments of expected satiety and expected satiation \[6\]. 

 Together, this research and the novel methodologies comprise the ‘Bristol Satiety Toolkit’. A further application of the toolkit has been to understand individual differences in dietary behaviour. For example, and in combination with neuroimaging, these methods have shown differences in underlying drivers of portion selection in people with obesity and in patients with anorexia nervosa.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Food product reformulation is often complex, because lower\-calorie ingredients affect shelf life and impact consumer acceptability. One option is to simply reduce portion size. However, this approach is only suited to pre\-portioned foods and portion reduction has the potential to undermine brand reputation due to low consumer acceptability. 

 Research and methodology developed by Brunstrom and Ferriday, the ‘Bristol Satiety Toolkit’ \[including 1\-6\], has enabled international food industry leaders to estimate and compare the likely impact of reformulations on consumer expected satiation, satiety and product acceptability. The toolkit has been applied to a broad range of savoury, sweet, main meal and snack foods, including sugary products which are a key target for public health mitigation, as well as retailer own brand products. Industry investment and collaboration over 13 years, has enabled food manufacturers to address public health concerns while maintaining product integrity. UoB research has changed practice in this multi\-billion\-pound industry. 

#  Informing food industry strategy, operations and practices 

#  i\) Nestlé 

 Nestlé is the world’s leading nutrition, health and wellness company. A longstanding collaboration \(2007 onwards\) between the Nestlé Research Centre \(NRC\) and Prof Brunstrom, has supported the development of the Bristol Satiety Toolkit. 

 The Head of Behaviour & Perception Group and Head of Consumer Science at the NRC acknowledges that one of their key challenges has been to; *‘understand consumer beliefs about food, and in particular, the satiety and satiation that consumers expect their products to confer’* \[A\]. Methods developed by UoB, have allowed Nestlé’s researchers to meet this challenge and explore ways to reduce portion size without impacting consumer satisfaction \[Bi, ii\], as well as assess changes in the physical dimensions of a food offering \[C\]. These industry studies \[Bi, ii, C\], particularly have drawn on the UoB approach \[2\], citing this in their own methodology as well as drawing on the wider Bristol Satiety Toolkit \(including \[1,3\]\). 

 Importantly, the NRC have confirmed the role of UoB methods in changing their Research and Development operations for well\-known products and brands: ‘ *As a direct consequence \[of UoB methods\], we have assessed the expected satiation of several of our product lines, including ready meals commercialized under the Lean Cuisine brand. With these tools we have been able to explore ways to enhance expected satiation and to propose guidelines for the reformulation of our products for enhancing satiation \(fullness\)’* \[A\]. The Lean Cuisine brand constitutes 30% of Nestlé’s USD2.6 billion USA prepared food sales \(data from 2017\) \[Aii\]. 

 The NRC have also expanded this area of product development to understand brain responses \(using EEG\) to portion sizes \[D\], in doing so, citing methods developed in collaboration with UoB \[2\]. In total, seven industry studies from the NRC, examining up to 19 commercially available meals, as well as gummy candy and ice cream products, cite the Bristol Satiety Toolkit \[G\]. 

#  ii\) Mars Wrigley 

 Leading manufacturer of confectionary treats and snacks, Mars Wrigley, has also *‘followed the work of Professor Brunstrom’* \[E\] and in 2019, a new project leveraged UoB expertise to understand the impact of product reformulation \[E\]. A Mars Wrigley senior research scientist highlights how this has been incorporated into their product development processes; ‘ *With this partnership we have developed ways to model and predict the potential effects of portion reduction on expected satiety and consumer choice.’* 

 They also highlight the benefit for their company; *‘This work is very important to us because it can help guide us to the most effective solutions in reducing calorie density while maintaining consumer satisfaction and enjoyment’* \[E\]. 

#  iii\) Wider commercial adoption application 

 A scoping review of published literature \(detailed methodology and complete output list provided in \[G\]\), revealed that since 1<sup>st</sup> August 2013, 33 publications directly or indirectly supported by the food industry, have drawn on the UoB methodology and 19 of these outputs directly cited the Bristol Satiety Toolkit \[including 1\-6\] \[G\]. Three studies were undertaken by multinational consumer goods company Unilever and include an independent validation and application of aspects of the UoB framework \[F\]. The 19 studies identified, applied the Bristol Satiety Toolkit to a wide range of both savoury and sweet, main meal and snack foods, including fruit juice, yoghurt and confectionary products \[G\], which are a key target of public health sugar reduction strategies. The breadth of products shows the relevance of the UoB methodology across the food industry. 



 **Figure 1:** Summary of scoping review data \[G\]. Text size indicates relative frequency \(actual frequency in brackets\) of food industry manufacturers \(=9\) and commercial innovation \(=1\), which draw on \(=33\) and directly cite \(=19\) the Bristol Satiety Toolkit \(some studies funded by more than one food manufacturer\).* 

#  Industry collaboration and investment 

 Studies identified by the scoping review \[G\] made use of funding from BBSRC DRINC \(Diet and Health Research Industry Club\), a collaboration between industry \(14 company members\) and academic research to deliver enhanced health benefits for consumers. This collaboration included major food manufacturers \(e.g., Coca Cola, Nestlé\) and retailers \(e.g. Sainsburys, Marks and Spencer\) along with a GBP22 million budget, highlighting the importance of this area to the food industry. Brunstrom and Ferriday collaborated on four of these studies \[G\] which cited the Bristol Satiety Toolkit and included investigation of portion size in own brand meals from Sainsburys and Asda. 

 Two new multidisciplinary collaborative projects \[Hii\-iii\], part of the ‘Priming Food Partnerships’ between academic and industry partners, centre around the Bristol Satiety Toolkit \[1\-3\]. Using UoB methods, one of these projects is generating multidisciplinary approaches to developing high\-protein foods for healthy ageing, and the other is investigating the effects of reduced\-fat reformulations on feelings of ‘fullness’. Together, these projects are financed by 13 different food manufacturers including Pladis, Nestlé, Unilever, Pepsico, and Premier Foods \[Hi \- iii\]. This continued investment and collaboration further demonstrates the value of the Bristol Satiety Toolkit for industry.

 **The Significance of the Large Hadron Collider** 

 The Large Hadron Collider LHC\) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research \(CERN\) is the world's most powerful particle collider, designed to investigate the structure of matter and the laws of nature. The four LHC experiments – ATLAS, ALICE, CMS and LHCb – record high\-energy proton collisions and use them to test the predictions of the Standard Model \(SM\) of particle physics, our current best theory of fundamental particles and their interactions. Experiments at the LHC search for signs of physics beyond the SM, which is required to address some of the most important questions in science: the nature of dark matter, the origin of matter, and the relative weakness of gravity compared to other fundamental forces. 

 **Cambridge Research and the LHC** 

 The aim of the Collider exhibition was to engage the public with the science and engineering of the LHC. The content was based directly on the research of the Department’s High Energy Physics \(HEP\) group, in particular the development of detector technologies for ATLAS \(Professor Andy Parker\) and LHCb \(Professor Valerie Gibson and Dr Harry Cliff\), and the search for new physics, including discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 . 

 **Key research carried out by the HEP group and featured in the exhibition**: 

-  The Cambridge group has played a leading role in the ATLAS experiment \[R1\] since 1986. Prof. Andy Parker was a founder of ATLAS and project leader for the ATLAS Inner Detector for six years. The Cambridge group developed, produced and quality controlled the silicon microstrip sensors, modules and readout electronics of the ATLAS semiconductor tracker \(SCT\), essential for tracking particles as they emerge from the collision region. It also played a leading role in the development of data acquisition and monitoring for the online commissioning, calibration, readout and offline software of the SCT. This was essential for the discovery of the Higgs boson \[R2\], verifying the SM of particle physics and the mechanism by which fundamental particles acquire mass. The discovery of the Higgs boson led to the 2013 Nobel Prize for Physics. 

-  The Cambridge group led the search for supersymmetry \[R3\], an extension of the SM that resolves many major unanswered questions in fundamental physics, including the nature of dark matter, the origin of matter, and the mass of the Higgs boson. It was instrumental in developing new techniques to search for supersymmetric particles. These measurements ruled out many of the most popular versions of supersymmetry, forcing theoretical physicists to rethink many of their ideas and profoundly affecting our understanding of fundamental physics. The group also made major contributions to the search for microscopic black holes, predicted by several theories featuring extra dimensions of space which attempt to reconcile the weakness of gravity with the strengths of other fundamental forces. These measurements disproved many versions of these theories, providing essential information for theorists. 

-  The Cambridge\-LHCb group under Prof. Val Gibson makes a leading contribution to the LHCb experiment, developing read\-out electronics and control systems for RICH \(ring\-imaging Cherenkov\) detectors essential for identifying different types of particles \[R4\], which are key to almost all measurements at LHCb. Prof. Val Gibson and Dr. Harry Cliff have led studies of charge\-parity symmetry violation in the decay of beauty quarks \[R5, R6\], attempting to understand why matter and not antimatter dominates the universe, and to search for deviations from the predictions of the SM that could indicate the existence of new particles. These measurements demonstrated that the SM has insufficient charge\-parity symmetry violation to account for the preponderance of matter, profoundly impacting our understanding of high energy physics and cosmology. Prof. Gibson is a leading member of LHCb, having acted as UK Spokesperson and Chair of the Collaboration Board, representing 78 institutes worldwide. 

 Drawing on this body of research, and other work carried out at the LHC, University of Cambridge LHCb researcher Dr Harry Cliff – acting as Lead Curator and Head of Content for Collider \- developed the content of the exhibition in collaboration with the University’s Department of Physics, the Science Museum and CERN.

 **Introduction** 

 University of Cambridge LHCb researcher Dr Harry Cliff led the Collider exhibition team as Lead Curator and Head of Content. The exhibition, co\-sponsored by STFC \(Science and Technology Facilities Council\) and Winton Capital Management, had a budget of GBP2 million and filled 800m<sup>2</sup>. It ran for six months at the Science Museum, London from November 2013, before touring Manchester, Paris, Singapore, Sydney and Brisbane between May 2014 and May 2017, attracting over 650,000 people \[E1\]. The sustained impacts of the exhibition include \( *i*\) enhancing the public’s understanding of particle physics, \( *ii*\) pioneering new approaches to communicating science in museums and *\(iii\)* promoting the role of blue skies research amongst decision makers. Harry Cliff was awarded the Institute of Physics HEPP Science in Society Prize \(2015\) ‘for his work as Curator and Head of Content for the successful Collider exhibition and other outreach work with the Science Museum, CERN and the Cavendish Laboratory’ \[E2A\]. 

 **Enhancing the Public’s Understanding of Particle Physics** 

 The Collider exhibition promoted public understanding of the LHC and LHC research. National and international press reviews emphasised the exhibition’s ability to communicate the complexity of particle physics. David Blackburn from The Spectator \[E3A\] wrote: ‘ *I have a new party piece. I can explain, with a degree of clarity and precision, how the Hadron Collider at CERN works and what it is looking for. I can’t claim credit for this feat of exposition … I owe everything to Collider… This is the best show in town for world weary parents to share in their children’s awe*’. Steve Connor from the Independent described Collider as *‘a pocket version of the real thing, something that you can absorb and digest without getting a headache at the end of it all. It is a superb introduction to the esoteric world of experimental particle physics’* \[E3B\]. The Economist praised it as: *‘A smashing show…admirably the curators do not shy away from the notoriously complicated science the LHC was designed to shed light on’* \[E3C\]. 92% of visitors reported being either satisfied or very satisfied with the exhibition, and 93% agreed that the ‘ *LHC is the largest, most sophisticated and most powerful scientific device ever made*’ \[E4\]. 

 The Collider exhibition succeeded in attracting near\-equal proportions of male \(56%\) and female \(44%\) visitors \[E4\]. Given the gender imbalance in physics \(roughly 3:1 male to female at A\-level in the UK \[E5\]\) this was a substantial achievement and helped engage a previously under\-served female audience. Increased visibility of women in science and engineering improves female recruitment and retention in STEM \[E6\]. The presence of senior female scientists and engineers in the exhibition showcased the leading positions taken by women, providing role\-models for female enrolment. 

 The exhibition was able to influence a wide audience beyond those who visited through a package of online resources accessible via links on the Collider website, including Dr Harry Cliff’s Royal Institution \(RI\) lecture on his research at LHCb in October 2017, which has been viewed 2.3 million times, the fourth most viewed RI lecture of all time. As with the exhibition, viewers commented on how particle physics was made accessible: *‘Harry Cliff does such an amazing job of explaining incredibly difficult* physics’…‘ *Totally clear and engaging throughout*’ *…*‘ *This was a spectacular presentation – the best I’ve seen about particle physics*’ *…*‘ *superbly well explained \(for a layman like me\)*’ \[E7\]. 

 **Transforming the way museums communicate science** 

 The Collider exhibition broke new ground in science communication. The exhibition team led by Harry Cliff included an Olivier Award\-winning playwright, an Olivier Award\-winning video artist, theatre set designers, graphic designers and sound artists who created an immersive exhibition that recreated the environment at CERN and allowed visitors to ‘meet’ scientists and engineers through the use of video projection and sound \[E8\]. Genuine scientific apparatus, including components of the accelerator and detectors were set in the context in which they are used, aiding understanding and engagement. Phillip Ball from Prospect Magazine described it as \[E3D\] ‘ *a cultural shift...the transformation of an important scientific result \(Higgs discovery\) into an extraordinary cultural event isn’t a triumph of style over substance. It marks a shift in science communication’*. 

 For its ground\-breaking design, Collider won the The Dibner Award for Excellence in Museum Exhibits, with the citation praising it as a *‘fine example of collaboration between scientists, historians and museum professionals’* \[E2B\]. A day after the exhibition opened, The Independent ran a front page news story ‘Intelligent Design’ describing the exhibition as ‘one of *the most ambitious shows in the Science Museum’s 150 year history*… *art and science collide with spectacular results*’ \[E3E;E3F\]. Testimonials from visitors also support the success of the approach: ‘ *exceptional in its conceptual design and portrayal. Pictures/videos of how the God particle was detected are superb…It is a must see’* \[E9\]. As well as being extremely engaging, the use of visual models helped visitor understanding of complex scientific concepts: ‘ *It was one of my highlights…the 3D model, how it works, being in the beam. I understood after this the way the beams collide’* \[E4\]. 

 **Promoting the role of blue skies research amongst decision makers** 

 Leading figures in government, science and the cultural sector attended the Collider launch event, including the then Chancellor of the Exchequer \(George Osborne\), the Minister of State for Universities and Science \(David Willetts\), the Chief Executive of STFC, the Director General of CERN, the Head of the Cavendish Laboratory, Professor Peter Higgs, Professor Stephen Hawking, novelist Ian McEwan and numerous members of the international particle physics community \[E10\]. 

 Professor John Womersley, CEO of STFC at the time, noted the positive impact of Collider on government ministers: 

 ‘*an important bonus was the ability to use the launch event to target both David Willetts and George Osborne...it definitely helped form a positive impression of basic research...  We can’t make a causal connection, but a number of positive spending decisions followed. New money was made available for the Square Kilometre Array* \[a multibillion\-pound radio telescope\] *and later for DUNE* \[a major international neutrino experiment which subsequently attracted GBP119 million in UK government investment\]’ \[E11A;E11B\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 This case study describes the re\-discovery of lost films by Robert Paul, Britain’s most important early film pioneer and thus an important part of the country’s national heritage. Three exhibitions are also described which served to educate and inform the public about the importance of Paul, at the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford \(the country’s most important media museum\), in Tottenham \(near where Paul lived and worked\) and in the London Metropolitan Archive \(which has a previously under\-used silent film collection in its media holding\). A widely disseminated graphic novel was produced in partnership with the Nerve Centre, a small company who have identified new business opportunities to pursue as a consequence of this work, and the noted graphic artist ILYA \(who has also changed his approach as a consequence of this project\). Christie’s research also facilitated Lipton Plant Architects design of a new building, ‘The Light House’, as a permanent tribute to Paul in Muswell Hill, close to the location of Paul’s original studio.

 Over the past twenty years Ian Christie has uncovered the definitive story of the unique individual Robert Paul and his role in British and world history, the films he produced, and the technical innovations he made as a celebrated engineer in his own right. This research culminated in the 2019 monograph *Robert Paul and the Origins of British Cinema* which won the prestigious US Theatre Library Association’s Richard Wall Memorial Award for 2019. 

 Paul’s career started through replicating Edison’s Kinetoscope in London in 1894. In 1896, his ‘Animatograph’ projector was launched and ran nightly for a further two years at Leicester Square, London. His innovations included the first film made in Britain \(1895\), printed titling on\-screen, the illustrated film catalogue, many special effects and techniques such as the first two\-shot film in *Come Along, Do\!* \(1898\) and the first edited narratives in film, including one, *Scrooge* \(1901\), which was the earliest surviving screen adaptation of Dickens, and *Derby* in 1896, which showed the Prince of Wales’ horse Persimmon winning the famous race. At the time, the public had never been able to witness real\-life animated events without being there themselves; this was truly ground\-breaking. 

 Paul established one of the world’s first film studios in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1898 which produced 800 films. Most of these have been lost. Those that remain were largely forgotten about. The research was more difficult because Paul did not leave an archive of personal or business papers. The British Film Institute holds only a partial collection of his sales catalogues, and the German Bundesarchiv has a small collection of correspondence from the 1930s. All other material was gathered by Prof Christie from public records, newspapers and periodicals in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Extensive contextual research was undertaken on the early electrical industry, on moving\-picture development in the 1890s, on the growth of cinema between 1896\-1910, on Paul’s contribution to defence during the First World War, and to medical research. 

 Christie compiled the first modern collection of Paul’s 70 extant films in a DVD produced by the British Film Institute \(BFI\) in 2006 and has continued to identify further films since this date.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 In a *Guardian* piece lamenting Britain’s lack of concern with its film history, Peter Domankiewicz highlights the efforts of Christie to uncover and remember Robert Paul’s role in this, on the 150th anniversary of his birth. \[1a\]\] 

 Early silent film \(typically classified as being from \~1895\-1929\) is rare. Of the >10,000 films that were released by major studios in this period, the US Library of Congress estimates only 14% survive. These films offer historians a unique opportunity to see real\-life, real\-time historical figures, settings and details as well as providing insights into attitudes about \(at the time\) current events and at times can provide crucial evidence to correct the historical record. \[1c\] 

 <ins> **\(Re\)</ins><ins>Discovery of Robert Paul films</ins><ins>:**</ins> Paul created hundreds of films but most have been lost. In the census period for impact, by piecing together clues from Paul’s remaining source material and early film catalogues Christie has successfully located and identified two full films by Paul, *The Pocket Boxers* \(1903\) in the British Pathé collection, and *Bloodhounds Tracking a Convict* \(1903\) in the Norwegian National Film Archive. He has also identified a fragment of Paul’s *The Burning House* \(1909\) in the Huntley Archive. 

 He also directly supported the positive identification of Paul films located by others. Christie’s help was ‘vital’ for the identification of Paul films at the Swedish Film Institute, *The Fatal Hand* \(1907\), *A Collier’s Life* \(1904\) *Short\-Sighted Sammy or the Stolen Spectacles* \(1905\). \[2a\] *A Collier’s Life* is particularly significant and has been heralded as ‘the birth of British documentary film’. \[2b\] 

 Christie’s research on Paul has also added greatly to the BFI’s data and knowledge on this important figure in our film history. Films have been identified, correctly catalogued and restored. The BFI has benefitted from Christie’s research in collections in Italy, Norway, Australia and the USA, where Christie has identified many new titles. Thanks to Christie, the BFI are gradually adding to the national collection by acquiring copies of these films through the inter\-archival exchange process. As well as the films outlined above, these include *The Soldier’s Courtship*, *Fun on the Clothesline*, and *The Dreamer’s Dance*. All of these are being made available for all through a recent project to digitise the whole of the BFI’s collection of Victorian film on  [BFI Player](https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/collection/victorian-film). These films are a vital part of British, and world, cultural history, and this work includes a rich section dedicated to Paul, enabled by Christie’s research. The legacy of Ian’s work in the context of the newly accessible films, and particularly his book, will be profound both for film history and for the BFI’s remit to preserve, make accessible and understandable the film heritage of this nation. This work will return Robert Paul to the pantheon of pioneer filmmakers and turn of the century London to the history books as a crucible of film invention. \[1b\] 

 At the National Science and Media Museum, Christie also identified 18 Paul titles which had been thought lost. \[3\] 

 <ins> **Popularising Robert Paul</ins><ins>:**</ins> Christie’s work has had an enormous impact popularising the memory of Paul to audiences in Britain and abroad, with considerable knock\-on effects on artists, museums, community organisations and business. 

 Christie designed *Animatograph\!* an exhibition about the life of Paul, featuring many of his original instruments. This was displayed at Bruce Castle, Tottenham, near Paul’s film studio in Muswell Hill, between 04/19 and 07/19, and subsequently at the London Metropolitan Archives between 10/19 and 11/19. A major redesigned and expanded version called *Forgotten Showman* was held at the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford between 12/19 and 03/20 \(viewed by over 30,000 people\) and again between 08/20 and 11/20 and between 12/20 and 02/21 \(the extensions being due to Covid as well as popularity\). \[3\] *Forgotten Showman* was described by the reviewer in the *Museums Journal* as ‘one of the best exhibitions I’ve seen in a while, being both daring in its execution and true to its subject matter’. \[4\] 

 Visitor comments across all 3 exhibitions express the common sentiment that Paul, despite being such an important figure, was unknown to them prior to the exhibition: 

 The exhibition had significant impacts on all three venues. For the London Metropolitan Archives it attracted increased attention’ to its archival collections related to Paul and silent film generally, and also expanded its audience for the films available to watch on site in the LMA Mediatheque. \[6a\] Bruce Castle also gained new audiences as a result, and the exhibition raised their profile significantly. Visitor feedback was overwhelmingly positive and visitors actively participated in associated events to learn more. Its success was such that as a result the museum are currently planning new, more permanent displays to better mark the significance of the local area to British and world cinema history, including the acquisition of new items for our collections. \[6b\] 

 The exhibition at the National Science and Media Museum enabled staff to make innovative and better use of the range of their collections and develop new skills and techniques for showing film, including original, combustible, film fragments. The exhibition enabled them to showcase items donated by Paul himself which had not been on general display for some time. Paul’s eclectic career not just as a filmmaker but as an inventor meant it was one of the few exhibitions where they had been able to draw directly from multiple Science Museum Group collections to support the narrative including their ‘Electricity and Magnetism’, ‘Mathematics’, and ‘Therapeutics’ Collections. The popularity of the social history aspects was also important for a science museum keen to attract new audiences. \[3\] 

 A central innovation for the exhibitions and supporting activities was the creation of 12,000 copies of a comic, *Time Traveller:* *Robert Paul and the invention of cinema* \(2019\). Christie wrote the story in collaboration with renowned artist ILYA, who developed the panels. Expanded versions of the panels formed a major feature in all three exhibitions. \[7\] At Bruce Castle, the interactive design and content of the graphic panels alongside original films and equipment had great community impact and the layering of different learning styles encouraged engagement in the exhibition. The comic was especially important in this regard, proving ‘n invaluable and accessible heritage resource which was relevant and appealing, especially to the 12\-16 years’ age group, a particularly hard\-to\-reach audience in the heritage sector’ \[6b\] 

 ILYA’s artworks formed the entire basis of the design of Bradford’s show, which also involved a further commission of bespoke artworks, a Top Trumps style game, wall displays and more. \[7\] These were not simply replicated from the comic but featured new graphics with new text to work with the new objects and interactive elements of the exhibition. The National Science and Media Museum had not previously worked with a graphic artist for an exhibition so this was an entirely original experience, but hugely beneficial. Using a visual method to present a story of the development of a visual medium was a perfect marriage and was more visually engaging, with the transfer of the tone and style of the comic providing a very different feel to the usual exhibition text. The audience evaluation told us that our target audiences wanted the combination of both illustration and text and of our general visitors, at least three quarters referred to the illustrations, compared to less than half who read the text next to it. \[3\] 

 For the Museum, Mirroring the more playful text, we also displayed objects in ways we have not tried before, for example to demonstrate the rivalry between Robert Paul and the Lumiere Brothers and their respective projection equipment, we staged the two in a fake boxing ring ‘facing off’ against each other with illustrations provided by the artist ILYA. This enabled visitors to become more engaged with the drama and competitiveness of the time and challenge the traditional view of objects in glass cases to be found in Museums. \[3\] For ILYA, despite having worked with major companies such as DC Comics, this process had a significant impact and he has since developed similar work on the poet Chatterton for the Bristol Cultural Development Partnership. Having *Time Traveller* as a successful publication helps him make such things happen. \[7\] 

 The comic was widely distributed, including 2,000 copies sent to subscribers of the November 2019 issue of *Sight & Sound*, who described the comic as an example of inventive, lively thinking on how to present study of early cinema. Their reader feedback demonstrated that their coverage of early cinema is a key appeal for many readers, and material on relatively underexplored areas within early cinema is of crucial importance. Christie’s comic, along with an article by him in the magazine itself, offered that sense of new discovery in an authoritative and clear way. Their readers look to us for coverage of cinema they don’t get elsewhere, and here was a key example of a crucial figure in the development of cinema – and British cinema in particular – being presented in an engaging way. \[8a\] Another key audience for the comic were attendees at the Giornate del Cinema Muto \(Pordenone Silent Film Festival, the world’s oldest and largest archival silent film festival, now entering its 39<sup>th</sup> edition\), with 250 copies presented to donors at the 2019 festival. Each year, over 1,000 people attend the festival, including archivists from the world’s major archives, film conservators and restorers, academics and the public. 

 The comic was produced by the Nerve Centre, a small company employing 54 staff across Derry and Belfast, with three people working directly on the comic itself. It has published ten educational graphic novels since 2012, all related to twentieth\-century Ireland. *Time Traveller* was a new direction for the company. The comic presented them with a new source of funding for their graphic novels, with a grant of £7,500 \(or GBP7500\) from Northern Ireland Screen. 

 A key attraction for the Nerve Centre was the opportunity to work closely with ILYA, an internationally celebrated artist, and to publish his work. The project has opened up new distribution outlets, especially the subscribers of Sight and Sight Magazine. \[9\] 

 <ins> **North London</ins><ins>:**</ins> Christie’s series of talks on Paul in North London significantly benefitted a range of local community and civic organisations, attracting new audiences, boosting their revenue, and enhancing a sense of local pride. \[10a\] Christie was further influential in the creation of what will be a permanent marker to Paul in Muswell Hill. Lipton Plant Architects were granted planning approval in 2019 for a new mixed\-use building near Paul’s former film studio which they called ‘The Light House’. They wanted a specific creative brief that would be a bespoke, site\-specific result that is recognisably original, intelligently resolved, aesthetic, enduring and valuable. The final design emulates a film projector, and takes inspiration from Paul’s studio, which they learned about during their background research on the area. \[10b\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Insights from mathematical models developed at Sussex have been implemented in Ukraine \(the world’s largest producer of sunflower seeds and in the top six producers of potatoes, wheat, barley and corn globally\) with the following impact: 

-  Improvement of farming practices in the Prydniprovsky region of Ukraine, resulting in increased crop viability by 7\-12% and reduction in pest control costs by 15\-20%. The region contains almost 20% of the total Ukrainian sown area of agricultural crops and occupies a third of the country’s steppe. 

-  Development by Ukrainian biotech companies of natural biostimulants which have been used throughout Ukraine, increasing yields of wheat \(by 11\-21%\), barley \(9\-18%\) and sunflowers \(19\-63%\), tomatoes \(20\-66%\), potatoes \(10\-12%\) and cucumbers \(23\-26%\). These biostimulants reduce the need for environmentally harmful pesticides, and are proving to be a successful alternative for use in organic farming. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 With the rapidly growing world population and major changes in the global climate, an important factor in sustaining food productivity and security is the ability to effectively and environmentally\-safely protect agricultural crops. Their performance can be hindered by many factors, including significant risk from pathogens and parasites that annually cause losses estimated to be in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars. For many years, this problem was addressed using chemical pesticides, but the emergence of pathogen resistance and the potential harm to humans have necessitated the development of alternative approaches. 

 Having previously published several highly\-cited papers on mathematical modelling of the effects of awareness on control of directly transmitted infections, in 2017, Blyuss collaborated with colleagues from Visva\-Bharati University in India on modelling vector\-borne infections of crop plants and their control \[R1\]. Their paper proposed a mathematical model for control of mosaic disease through application of nutrients \(fertilisers\) and insecticides. Analysis of the conditions for disease persistence produced quantitative results for the amounts of nutrients and insecticides that need to be used in order to achieve disease eradication, depending on various factors, such as the rate of disease transmission from vectors to plants, vector mortality, as well as the carrying capacity of crop plantations, and farmer awareness based on observing the proportion of infected plants. 

 Subsequently, in collaboration with colleagues from India and Ukraine, Blyuss conducted another study that mathematically modelled the effects of applying microbial biostimulants for the purpose of improving crop performance and protecting crops against parasites \[R2\]. That work identified quantitative relations between the amount of biostimulants required for disease eradication and various features of disease transmission, as well as parameters characterising the performance of these biostimulants, such as their effect on inducing reduction in disease transmission from vectors to plants, and the increase in vector mortality. Although these models used an example of plant mosaic disease, the modelling framework and results are applicable to other plant pests and parasites. 

 One very promising approach for safe and effective control of crop parasites currently pursued by some of the world's largest agrochemical companies is that of RNA interference \(RNAi\), also known as “gene silencing”. RNAi is a fundamental biological process \(discovery of this was recognized with a Nobel Prize in 2006\), by which eukaryotic cells can control expression of specific genes after they are already transcribed. In the specific context of protecting plants from infection, RNAi is used in two different ways. Providing plants, by means of spraying or root soaking, with appropriate double\-stranded RNA \(dsRNA\) can help them stop expressing genes that are necessary for a successful infection. On the other hand, RNAi can also be used to target parasites, where parasites feed on plants and ingest dsRNA that then triggers the process of RNAi against parasites’ own genes, thus reducing their fecundity and causing mortality. 

 The progress in developing RNAi\-based tools for pest control, particularly microbial bioregulators, has been hampered by the lack of detailed quantitative description of the dynamics of RNAi in plants and parasites. To address this problem, Blyuss, Kyrychko and Neofytou at Sussex developed the first ever mathematical models of RNAi in plants \[R3\-R5\] that provided quantitative insights into the mechanisms of how plants respond to infections by means of RNAi. These models showed how the optimal rate at which plant cells are able to express necessary dsRNA constructs, protecting them from infection and/or parasitism, depends on other fundamental parameters, such as plant cell maturation rate, the rate of spread of infection within the plant, as well as how RNAi in the cells of parasites can be amplified by using other types of small interfering RNAs \(siRNAs\). These results have provided quantitative predictions of the influence of different parameters on the effectiveness of RNAi in silencing plant genes involved in infestation, as well as the essential nematode genes. 

 Subsequently, Blyuss established contacts with colleagues at three research institutes of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and together they have used theoretical findings from these models to develop natural microbial biostimulants produced from soil bacteria that are capable of protecting crops against parasitic nematodes using the mechanism of RNAi. The results of this research have been published in Frontiers in Plant Science \[R6\], the world’s most cited peer\-reviewed journal in the field of plant science, where it was experimentally shown how natural microbial biostimulants are able to reduce the levels of nematode infestation in wheat, while targeting essential nematode genes. By January 2021, this paper was viewed over 8100 times by readers from 38 countries and all continents. It has also attracted significant attention on Twitter and in the press.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 This Impact Case Study focuses on Ukraine, which, according to the latest data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation \(Statistics Division\), is the world’s largest producer of sunflower seeds, and in the top six producers of potatoes, wheat, barley and corn globally. In spring 2019, Ukraine overtook China to become the third largest exporter of agricultural products to the EU after Brazil and the USA. Translation of research results \[R1\-6\] has resulted in a better\-informed practices around using fertilisers and pesticides to protect crops against pests, and in the development of natural, environmentally\-safe crop biostimulants. This has led to the increase in crop yields by 7\-12% with an associated reduction in expenses for crop protection of 15\-20% in the Prydniprovsky region of Ukraine, which contains 20% of the total Ukrainian sown area and produces 8% of the world’s sunflower. Natural microbial biostimulants developed through translation of theoretical results have already proved effective in increasing crop yields in major cereals, such as wheat, barley and sunflowers by 11\-21%, 9\-18% and 19\-63%, respectively, while for vegetables, the yields for tomatoes, potatoes and cucumbers have increased across the country by 20\-66%, 10\-12%, and 23\-26%. 

 **Changing farming practices to improve crop viability and reduce pest control costs** 

 In 2017, Blyuss visited Ukraine and signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the University of Sussex and the Prydniprovsky Scientific Centre of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine \(PSC\). In collaboration with colleagues from the Dnipro State Agrarian and Economic University and the PSC, during 2017\-2018 Blyuss translated theoretical results from R1\-3 into practical recommendations for farmers on optimal strategies of using nutrients, pesticides and microbial biostimulants for protecting crops against pests, based on monitoring the levels of infection at crop plantations. These practical recommendations, focused on crop pests native to the steppe region, were subsequently distributed to farming companies and agribusinesses in the Prydniprovsky region of Ukraine, with 40% of farmers in the region adopting these recommendations into their farming practices. In terms of reach, the Prydniprovsky region contains almost 20% of the total Ukrainian sown area of agricultural crops and occupies a third of the country’s steppe. It has an abundance of fertile chernozem soil, and, according to latest data from the Ukrainian National Statistics Service, produces 20.2% of the total Ukrainian harvest of wheat, 21.8% of barley, 13.3% of vegetables, and 26.3% of sunflower \[S1, link 3\]. In fact, in 2019 that region alone produced 8% of the total amount of sunflower produced worldwide. 

 Professor Anatolii Bulat, President of the Prydniprovsky Scientific Centre, has noted: 

 “Currently, monitoring and control of the processes of growth and development of agricultural crops on farming lands of various agribusinesses in the Prydniprovsky region are performed in accordance with the results of scientific research and technical recommendations developed by Dr K.B. Blyuss…. Through close collaboration with farmers and agribusinesses, … currently around 40% of farmers in Prydniprovsky region are already using above\-mentioned technical recommendations. This has allowed farmers and agribusinesses to increase the survivability of crops by 7\-12%, to improve quality and yields of cereal crops, and to reduce expenses associated with control of crop pests by 15\-20%, compared to 2015\-2017 when these techniques were not used. Reductions in expenses were associated with reduced fuel and personnel costs, as well as a substantial reduction in the amount of nutrients, fertiliser and pesticides being used. The latter factor is a particularly important achievement of the newly developed technical recommendations from the perspective of reduction and minimisation of the negative impact of pesticides on environment and biodiversity.” \[S1\]. 

 With 18% of the working population of Ukraine being involved in agriculture, new technical recommendations on monitoring of crop infestation and the use of pesticides have had a direct impact on performance of local agribusiness in the Prydniprovsky region. 

 Mr N. Nodzrin, Chief Agronomist of the company “Pisarevsky Oleksandr Stepanovych” based in Vodyane, has said: “As a result of applying practical recommendations regarding monitoring the levels of crop infestation with pests, as well as optimal use of fertilizers and biostimulants, that have been developed by Dr K.B. Blyuss together with colleagues, our expenses associated with control of crop pests have reduced by 12.5\-18.0%, while the viability of wheat and barley plants has increased by 7.5\-10%.” \[S2\]. 

 Similarly, Mr Viktor Lisnyi, the Director of “Lisnyi Viktor Mykolayovych” company, specializing in producing cereal grains, sunflower and corn on its 11ha farm in Promin’, has noted: 

 “This year we have used a new approach to monitoring of plant growth and protection against pests using pesticides and fertilizers, developed by Dr K.B. Blyuss together with colleagues ... This has allowed us to not only increase the viability of wheat, barley, oat and rapeseed plants by 8\-10% on average, but it has also reduced our costs for control of pests of these plants by 15\-18%.” \[S3\]. 

 **Enabling the development of successful organic biostimulant products for improved crop protection and yields** 

 In R3\-5, Blyuss and Kyrychko proposed and analysed mathematical models of RNA interference, explaining quantitatively how this process develops in plants, and how it can be used to target plant parasites. Results of these models helped their colleagues in the Institute of Microbiology and Virology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine select metabolites of soil bacteria that result in the highest levels of within\-plant production of siRNAs protecting plants against parasites, and it was these metabolites that formed the basis of natural microbial biostimulants. After testing in laboratory, greenhouse and field conditions, in 2018 Ukrainian agro\-investment and agrochemical companies “Bioinvest\-agro” \( [http://www.bioinvest.com.ua](http://www.bioinvest.com.ua/)\) and “Imptorgservice” \( [imptorgservis.uaprom.net](http://www.imptorgservis.uaprom.net/)\) produced these biostimulants and sold them to farmers and over 100 major agribusinesses around Ukraine and in Kazakhstan. The latter of these companies has annual sales of $500,000 \- $1million. Besides direct economic impact in terms of profits to these agrochemical companies, the biostimulants have also resulted in a substantial improvement of crop performance for individual farmers and agribusinesses using them. More specifically, across different regions of Ukraine, these biostimulants have increased yields of winter wheat, barley and sunflowers by 11\-21%, 9\-18% and 19\-63%, respectively, while for vegetables, the yields for tomatoes, potatoes and cucumbers have increased across the country by 20\-66%, 10\-12%, and 23\-26% due to using natural biostimulants \[S4, S5\]. 

 By virtue of being produced from natural products of soil bacteria, natural microbial biostimulants can be used for organic farming. This is extremely important, since organic farmers suffer substantial losses due to inability to protect their crops against pests using conventional pesticides. In this respect, these natural microbial biostimulants are providing a viable alternative, which allows to protect crops against parasites, while minimizing negative effects on the environment, and maintaining standards of organic farming. One of these biostimulants – “Phytovit”, produced by “Bioinvest\-agro” \[see R6\] – has been approved for organic farming and even received international “Organic standard” certification recognized by the EU and Switzerland \[S4\] and is currently used by some of the largest organic farming companies in Ukraine. 

 Results of theoretical and experimental work on natural biostimulants have been published in a joint research publication \[R6\] in Frontiers in Plant Science, the world’s most cited journal in the field of plant science. Due to major significance of this work in terms of providing effective, and at the same time, environmentally safe, tools of pest control, this work has been covered by a large number of global media specializing in farming and agriculture. This includes articles in English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and Turkish \[S6\]. 

 The significance of this work has been recognised by an award to Blyuss and Kyrychko of Letters of Gratitude from the PSC, which is the highest honour that can be awarded \(only once\) to any scientist for their major scientific contribution to solving problems of significant practical importance. These awards were given to Blyuss and Kyrychko on the 17 May 2019 at the annual Day of Science ceremony, organised by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine \[S7\]. 

 Natural microbial biostimulants are already widely used in Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The next phase of impact will concentrate on certification of other natural microbial biostimulants for the purpose of their use in organic farming. The largest Ukrainian producer of organic commodities, which is also the second largest organic grower in Europe and the biggest exporter of organic soybean and corn from Ukraine to the EU, is currently testing these biostimulants for the purpose of adopting them as main tools of pest control in its agricultural lands.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by McGeown at the University of Edinburgh on early reading instruction, reading motivation and sex differences has had a positive impact in the Scottish education sector in three critical ways. It has: 

1.  **Changed literacy practice** by directly engaging teachers, head teachers, local authorities and national organisations in her research on early reading instruction and motivating children and adolescents to read. 

1.  **Influenced national programmes** by shaping their strategic work, programmes and resources to: enhance reading motivation and engagement and address gender imbalance. 

1.  **Contributed to parliamentary debate** to raise literacy attainment through research\-informed reading instruction. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Raising literacy attainment and closing the poverty\-related attainment gap are key priorities of the Scottish Government, as seen in its 2019 National Improvement Framework and Improvement Plan. Good literacy skills support language development and academic achievement, and are associated with positive post\-school economic, health and psychological outcomes. Furthermore, motivation to read and engagement in book reading activities are essential for children and adolescents to develop their literacy skills. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure children and adolescents experience optimal reading instruction and teaching practices to enhance their reading motivation and engagement. 

 McGeown’s research takes a psychological approach to reading development in childhood and adolescence, exploring multiple factors that influence motivation, engagement and attainment across primary and secondary school contexts. McGeown led this programme of research, collaborating with Medford and Johnston \(University of Hull\), Duncan \(University of Dundee\) and Warhurst \(University of Winchester\). 

  

 McGeown’s work on raising literacy attainment demonstrates that systematic synthetic phonics \(an approach which teaches children to blend letter\-sounds to read unfamiliar words\) can specifically help to close the poverty\-related attainment gap as it optimally supports the early reading skills of children with weak vocabularies \(3.1\). Furthermore, her research has demonstrated how hyperactive and inattentive behaviours hinder children’s early literacy learning \(3.2\), and was the first to demonstrate the importance of children’s enjoyment of their initial reading instruction, as this is associated with positive reading attitudes, confidence and attainment \(3.3\). 

 McGeown’s research also examines the relationship between primary \(3.4\) and secondary \(3.5\) school students’ reading motivation, reading choices and reading skills. It was the first to show that children’s reading motivation drives their reading choices \(3.4\) and also demonstrated other important predictors of reading choices, including reading skill and child characteristics \(age, sex, socioeconomic status\) \(3.4\). Furthermore, her work contributed to the limited evidence on adolescents’ reading motivation, engagement and attainment, demonstrating that both motivation and ﬁction book reading \(but not other text types\) significantly predicted adolescents’ reading comprehension skills, after taking into account word reading and fluency skills \(3.5\). 

 Finally, McGeown’s innovative approach to study sex differences in education stresses that students’ gender identity \(i.e., their identification with traditional masculine and feminine traits\) is a more useful construct than sex to understand individual differences in reading and in other academic subjects \(3.6\). Her research also emphasises the need to provide more support for boys in literacy\-related education, as the motivation gap between boys and girls in literacy is much wider than in mathematics and science \(3.6\). 

 Research by McGeown has been shortlisted for the prestigious United Kingdom Literacy Association \(UKLA\) Wiley\-Blackwell Research in Literacy Education Award \(3.4\). Her research has also featured in leading education magazines, including *Tes* \(Jan, 2019\), *Teaching Scotland* \(Nov, 2018\) and *Times Education Supplement Scotland* \(Jan, 2015\).

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Research led by McGeown has had a positive impact on primary and secondary school students’ reading motivation, engagement and attainment, and it has supported work to redress gender imbalances in Scottish education. 

###  Changed literacy practice 

 Between 2016 and 2019, McGeown changed literacy teaching and raised students’ literacy attainment by sharing her research with more than 250 teachers, head teachers and local authority literacy leads at professional learning sessions throughout Scotland \[5.1\]. An ESRC Impact Acceleration Account funded an evaluation of the impact of these sessions \(survey with 75 teachers participating immediately after the sessions\) and found statistically significant increases in teachers’ knowledge and understanding of McGeown’s research \[5.2\], which recommended: systematic synthetic phonics instruction for beginning readers, and promotion of positive reading attitudes and motivation throughout school. A 15\-month follow up questionnaire demonstrated the long\-term impact of these sessions. Teachers reported that they had changed their literacy practice, for example: one teacher *“adjusted my reading teaching in line with the research recommendations”* and another enacted changes which resulted in improvements in pupils’ reading abilities: *“students have seen an increase in attainment data through a number of changes made”* \[5.2\]. 

 The practice of school leaders and teachers across Scotland has benefitted from McGeown’s research \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5\), via two invited webinars hosted by the General Teaching Council Scotland \(124 teachers attended\) \[5.3A\] and Education Scotland \(86 Head Teachers/Local Authority Literacy Leads attended\) \[5.3B\]. During the GTCS webinar, McGeown shared her research, which focused on the importance of systematic synthetic phonics instruction for beginning readers, to redress early educational inequalities. A post\-webinar survey with over 80 teachers found that 85% reported that the research shared would impact their practice \[5.3A\]. During the Education Scotland webinar, McGeown shared her research, which focused on understanding and promoting children’s and adolescents’ motivation to read, to encourage greater independent reading. Attendees subsequently shared the YouTube recording from this webinar, resulting in approximately 450 views in the first eight weeks. A Senior Education Officer \(Literacy\) at Education Scotland stated: *“Dr McGeown’s research on children’s and adolescents’ motivation to read is directly relevant to our national priorities in Scotland, more specifically, improving the literacy skills of children and young people”* \[5.4\]. She added: “ *my own understanding of research in this area has developed considerably as a result of my collaboration with Dr McGeown, and this research knowledge will continue to underpin the work we do in Scottish schools to promote reading for pleasure”*. 

 McGeown’s Scottish Universities Insight Institute funded knowledge exchange workshop series in 2017/18 also brought together policy makers, literacy leads, head teachers and teachers to draw on research to optimally tackle language and literacy issues in Scotland. During this series, McGeown shared her research on initial reading instruction \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3\) which supported Dundee City Council’s approach to literacy teaching: *“\[McGeown’s research\] added weight to… the decision Dundee’s Children and Families Service made to adopt a city\-wide approach to teaching reading using systematic synthetic phonics”* \[5.5\]. The Dundee City Council Education Support Officer further stated: *“connections with Dr McGeown and her research are invaluable in helping us improve literacy for children in Dundee.”* According to Pupil Census data from 2019, over 10,600 primary school pupils are enrolled in Dundee City Council schools annually. 

###  Influenced national programmes 

 Collaboration with the Scottish Book Trust \(SBT\) since 2017 has resulted in McGeown’s reading motivation and engagement research \(3.3, 3.4, 3.5\) informing the design of programmes which promote reading motivation and engagement among primary and secondary school pupils. For instance, “ *insights from her work on the importance of intrinsic reading motivation and the relationship between reading motivation, reading choices and reading attainment have been instrumental in one of our leading programmes, the First Minister’s Reading Challenge \(FMRC\)”* \[5.6\]. The FMRC is delivered in approximately 75% of primary and 60% of secondary schools across Scotland, reaching approximately 250,000 pupils each year. SBT’s evaluation of the FMRC highlighted that approximately 82% of participating primary schools and 66% of participating secondary schools report that their pupils are reading more as a result of the programme. Furthermore, the Head of Research and Evaluation at SBT added:  McGeown’s research “ *has increased the validity and weight of our advocacy communications”* and concluded that *“our partnership with Dr McGeown has been instrumental in us having a greater impact on local authorities, learning professionals and, crucially, children and young people”* \[5.6\] *.* 

 McGeown’s research on children’s gender identity and boys’ poor literacy engagement has also *“considerably shaped”* the work and focus of Education Scotland’s Improving Gender Balance & Equalities \(IGBE\) scheme \[5.7\], which works across all of Scotland’s 2,500 primary and secondary schools, reaching approximately 692,000 pupils each year. IGBE previously focused predominantly on girls. McGeown’s research on sex differences in education, particularly exploring gender identity and boys’ poor literacy engagement \(3.6\) shifted its focus to also *“understand how gender stereotypes can have a negative impact on boys”*. IGBE have *“worked closely with Dr McGeown and embedded her research into our resources for teachers*”. The IGBE Education Officer reported that: *“\[McGeown’s\] research highlighting the importance of understanding students’ gender identity, rather than their sex, is particularly helpful to challenge conventional thinking about distinct differences between boys and girls”.* Furthermore, *“her research highlighting the issue of boys’ lack of engagement in literacy considerably shaped our work across Scottish schools, which now also focuses on understanding how gender stereotypes can have a negative impact on boys”* \[5.7\]. IGBE’s evaluation of their programme and resources suggests this work is having a positive impact on raising teachers’ awareness, understanding and practice around gender imbalance. For example, 84% of teachers reported that IGBE had influenced how they work with young people around gender stereotypes. Furthermore, 95% felt they would share their IGBE learning with colleagues. 

###  Contributed to parliamentary debate 

 McGeown’s research \(3.1\) has underpinned parliamentary debate on approaches to raise literacy attainment across Scotland. Petitioner Anne Glennie drew extensively on McGeown’s research in her petition to the Scottish Parliament to improve literacy standards in schools. The petitioner writes: *“\[McGeown has\]* *been instrumental in providing evidence and scientific support… with ministers finding her research particularly compelling which demonstrated the short and long term benefits of synthetic phonics as opposed to the more eclectic approaches that are currently being used in Scotland”* \[5.8\]. 

 McGeown debated the petition in Parliament in November 2017 \[5.9A\]. When sharing her research on how current approaches to reading instruction in Scotland can disproportionately benefit children from more advantaged backgrounds, Convener MSP Johann Lamont, stated: *“I’m very struck by the evidence that we now have a strategy for teaching children to learn reading which enhances the opportunities for those who are already advantaged… I just find that very compelling.*” McGeown has also been involved in ongoing written discussions and debate with the Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills; McGeown contributed 5 of the 15 written submissions \[5.9B\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Peter Richardson’s research into the development and deployment of new, more economical and accessible methodologies for the production of complex cinematic visual effects has led to impact across three substantive areas: 

1.  **New Cinematic Methods**. The creation of new and innovative methods for creating complex visual effects at lower price points has increased opportunities for emergent filmmakers to create high quality cinematic films. Richardson’s programmes have supported young people aged 16\-24 to make films, and provided training, development and production support for over 70 innovative short film projects, with worldwide audiences. 

1.  **Policy and critical public debate.** The film *Slaughterbots* has raised awareness of the danger of lethal autonomous \(AI\) weapons. It was screened at the November 2017 meeting of the Geneva Convention on Conventional Weapons, has generated online reach of over 4 million YouTube views and continues to contribute to public debate on the issue. 

1.  **Capacity and Audience Building**. Research into the size and scale of creative industries in the North Sea Region \(NSR\) and the potential impact of virtual reality \(VR\) technologies \(particularly in non\-entertainment contexts\) has led to the development of new audiences and markets. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Richardson’s research into innovative visual effects techniques has been funded by a series of substantial grants from the European Union commencing with the €5.2 million North Sea Screen Partnership project \(2009\-2012 at Dundee, then 2012\-2014 at the University of Hertfordshire; all underpinning research described herein was undertaken at Hertfordshire\) and latterly a €1.5 million *Create Converge* grant \(2016\-2020\). The research falls into three main themes: 

 **1.New Cinematic Methods** 

 The Games and Visual Effects Lab \(G\+VERL\) at the University of Hertfordshire, led by Richardson \(Principal Investigator\) with David Tree \(Research Fellow\), researches methods and workflows for attaining high\-quality cinematic visual effects \(VFX\) and immersive experiences. VFX is now ubiquitous in cinema, however, the price point for cinematic\-quality VFX is prohibitively high with the market dominated by large multinational companies such as Framestore and ILM. The research asked: can high\-quality cinematic VFX sequences be achieved in the short to medium format? What new methodologies and processes can deliver these sequences in a time and cost\-effective manner? Richardson developed a novel combination of existing technologies, specifically the application of a new on\-set algorithm to stich High dynamic range imaging \(HDRI\) images together quickly to create a photo\-realistic environment into which CGI assets can be placed. The ease of use and cost\-effectiveness of this novel combination opens the door to the use of high\-quality VFX by users who would not previously have had access. 

 These new processes were developed iteratively through a series of Richardson’s films, disseminated via film festivals, screenings, conferences and academic papers worldwide: ‘ **Miss Donnithorne’s Maggott’** \(2012\) \[ **3.1**\], ‘ **Molly Makes A Dress’** \(2015\) \[ **3.2**\], ‘ **Caravan at The Edge Of The World’** \(2017\), ‘ **The Slotin Paradox**’ \(2019\), ‘ **Singularity**’ \(2020\) \[ **3.2**\]. 

 **2. Policy and critical public debate** 

 Richardson co\-produced the film **‘Slaughterbots’** \(2017\), commissioned by the Future of Life Institute \(funded by Elon Musk and Professor Stephen Hawking, c.£250,000\) to increase public understanding of the threat posed by the weaponisation of artificial intelligence \(AI\) technology. Filmed at the University of Hertfordshire, *Slaughterbots* portrays a near\-future scenario where swarms of autonomous drones use AI and facial recognition to assassinate political opponents, and utilises cinematic tropes closely associated with Hollywood disaster films. The research explored whether cinematic drama can be used to increase public awareness of the dangers posed by the un\-fettered development of lethal autonomous weapons \[ **3.4**\]. 

 **3. Capacity and Audience Building** 

 **‘Create Converge’** is an EU Interreg\-funded project which brings visualisation and games tech together across various sectors, aiming to boost digital industries in the North Sea region which includes Scotland, England, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden. Richardson’s work on capacity building for the NSR has produced many significant outputs showcasing the scope of VR technologies within and beyond entertainment: 

 **Zero Point VR** \(2017\) was an immersive VR installation at the Barbican, London – a collaboration between choreographer Darren Johnston \(ArrayUK\), Richardson and Tree \(G\+VERL\) and physicist Merritt Moore \(Oxford University\). The research investigated novel methods to visualise, in the form of a virtual reality installation, the concept of zero point energy \(the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical system may have\) in a form understandable by the general public. The experience was presented via the HTC Vive VR system with room scale tracking; to reduce distraction, motion controllers were not used. Instead the participant interacts by focussing their gaze on ‘totems’: when maintaining the gaze for more than 10 seconds the totem transports the participant to the next level \[ **3.5**\]. 

 ‘**Aarhus Walks On Water’** \(2017\) Research into emergent forms of immersive technology led to an invitation from the European Union 2017 City of Culture board for Richardson to participate and shape, as co\-creative director, the flagship event Aarhus Walks On Water \(AWOW\). Richardson contributed the overarching immersive concept and the opening film: ‘Stereo\-Lith\-Hydro\-D.98.’ The film tells the story of a group of women who take a journey through a dystopian modernist city; as the women each arrive at a high tower, they signal to a lone high board diver. The diver performs the perfect dive; as she hits the water she enters a surreal underwater landscape. As she emerges from the water a live immersive fashion/tech show begins, where models walk on a specially engineered catwalk, giving the effect of literally walking on water \[ **3.6**\]. 

 Richardson \(with the G\+VERL\) produced the data visualisation project **‘Visualising Creative Work’** \(2019\), which investigated novel methods for visualising the scale, economic benefit and impact on society of creative industries in the Danish North Sea regions. The team developed  algorithmic interrogation software, which gathered a dataset of businesses in Denmark who are involved in the creative industries. A virtual reality map viewable using a VR headset was then produced using a bespoke algorithm developed at G\+VERL. The tool allows such datasets to be viewed in many novel ways – for instance, as a cityscape where the heights of buildings represent the capacity and net worth of each company, and their outputs.

 **4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)** 

 Richardson’s research is designed purposefully to help industry adapt to and work with emergent technologies and workflows. It has led to streamlined VFX methods with significant cost savings, opportunities for emergent filmmakers, new understandings and opportunities for the creative industries, and has contributed to critical public and policy debate. 

 **1. New cinematic methods – impacts on filmmakers and the industry** 

 Young and emergent filmmakers are often excluded from utilising VFX within their films, due to such technology’s prohibitively high price point. New workflows and methodologies for high quality cinematic but cost\-effective VFX developed by Richardson have delivered significant cost savings, and driven schemes that have facilitated emergent filmmakers aged 16\-24, contributed to innovation and enabled access to careers in the creative industries: 

 The **‘Innovation Shorts’** programme \(2014, £121,000 EU grant\) in collaboration with Screen South \(UK\) and FilmFyn \(Denmark\), co\-produced four visual effects driven short films. Richardson acted as Executive Producer and Visual Effects Supervisor for the films, which were premiered at the 2014 Berlin Film Festival. 

-  Noted as “a great success for Screen South”, the programme “served as proof of concept to the European film industry that cost effective VFX could be achieved” using these methods, with **“a cost saving for VFX of approximately one third the market price** \(as of 2016\)” \- Jo Nolan, Managing Director, Screen South \[ **5.1**\]. 

-  It further “ **launched and enhanced the careers of the four filmmakers and teams involved**”, including: the Director who went on to form Fire Panda LTD, an award\-winning VR \+ AR development studio creating innovative interactive content and experiences which has a staff of four and employs many freelancers; the Writer / Director who has since written and directed film and TV series and won an International Emmy Award for ‘USS Callister’, his episode of Black Mirror 3 \[ **5.1**\]. 

 ‘Innovation Shorts’ served as the blueprint for the **Random Acts Ignition Network** \(2015\-2017\), set up by Richardson and Screen South, funded by the Arts Council and Channel 4 \(£400,000\). Over 100 young filmmakers in the south of England received funding, training and mentorship from industry professionals. Richardson worked as executive producer alongside Screen South and Fly Film, and the scheme produced 72 innovative short films which were either broadcast or shown online as part of Channel 4’s Random Acts series \[ **5.1**\]. The scheme kick\-started many careers in the UK film industry. A qualitative impact analysis commissioned by Screen South found that 100% of the lead creatives \(111\) and crew \(302\) believe it assisted with their next job, career or studying steps. Participants in the scheme have gone on to have their films screened at festivals worldwide, and win awards and grants including from the BFI and London Independent Film Festival \[ **5.2**\]. 

 Richardson’s innovative, research driven approach to film was “pivotal in developing new workflows and paradigms for storytelling in the rapidly emerging field of virtual reality. His research showed that high quality short form VR can be achieved at a lower price point \(under £20,000\)” \[ **5.1**\]. **New Creatives** \(2019\-2021\) is part of a Screen South / BBC Arts / Arts Council England programme \(£600,000\): a talent development scheme offering artists aged 16\-30 the chance to develop their creative and technical skills, developing fresh and innovative short films, audio and interactive works. Richardson’s research was “a major contributor to Screen South working with BBC Arts and BBC R&D to agree the inclusion of the interactive / VR strand” of the scheme \[ **5.1**\]. As Executive Producer and Production Partner \(interactive gaming / VR\), Richardson oversaw the development and production of 3 new Interactive VR experiences: ‘Singularity’ \(2020\), ‘Soil will Save Us’ \(2020\) and ‘Dichotomy’ \(2021\) and Phillip 21 \(2021\). 

 Screen South’s Managing Director concludes that without Richardson’s “long term commitment to innovative and novel technologies in film and now VR it is hard to imagine that Screen South would have been able to deliver the quality of projects expected of our funders” \[ **5.1**\]. Further, Matthew Nelson, Managing Director for Space Digital states that since the release of *Slaughterbots* \(below\), their “worldwide reputation for making highly impactful campaigning films has grown, leading to an increase in production and postproduction work for our company.” \[ **5.3**\] 

 **2. Policy and critical public debate** 

 Co\-produced by Richardson in collaboration with Space Digital \(Producer Mathew Nelson\), *Slaughterbots* \(2017\) used Richardson’s novel methodology for the production of low cost, high quality cinematic visual effects. The film, which depicts lethal attacks by AI\-controlled drone weapons, was launched anonymously to go viral – gaining 200,000 views in its first day alone. The work has generated vast media attention and public debate: by the end of 2020 it had over 4 million views on YouTube \[ **5.4**\] and has been featured on BBC, CNN, South China Morning Post, Fox News and The Economist to name a small selection. Science Alert \(November 2017\) called it “the best warning against autonomous weapons” \[ **5.5**\]. 

 The film has also contributed to global policy debate on fully autonomous weapons. It was presented by world\-renowned AI researcher Professor Stuart Russell \(UC Berkeley\) to a meeting of over 70 countries at the Fifth Review Conference of the Geneva Convention on Conventional Weapons \(CCW, 13\-17 Nov 2017 \[ **5.6**\]\). The film concludes with a statement from Russell that the technology depicted in the film already exists and could be deployed in the way imagined. The meeting marked an initial step towards agreeing a new CCW protocol on lethal autonomous weapons systems \(LAWS\), with meetings ongoing. According to the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, the film was “central in generating a slew of media coverage throughout the two weeks of CCW meetings” \[ **5.7**\]. A study by the US Air Force, published in *Future Warfare Series No. 60*, May 2020, cites the film in arguing that LAWS are weapons of mass destruction. In January 2020, US Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang shared a link to *Slaughterbots* when he called for a global ban on the use of autonomous weaponry \[ **5.8**\]. The film was “instrumental in securing an additional 20,000 signatures to the Future of Life Institute’s petition to ban autonomous weapons” \[ **5.3**\]. 

 *Slaughterbots* continues to contribute to critical public debate, being frequently featured in mainstream media worldwide in discussions on autonomous weaponry. A *Guardian* ‘long read’ in October 2020, ‘ *Machines set loose to slaughter’: the dangerous rise of military AI*’ states: “The lesson that the film, *Slaughterbots*, is trying to impart is clear: tiny killer robots are either here or a small technological advance away…when it comes to the future of war, the line between science fiction and industrial fact is often blurry.” Scenes from *Slaughterbots* also appeared in a New York Times video, *AI is Making it easier to kill \(you\): Here’s how* \(December 2019; over 900,000 YouTube views\). In it, Professor Russell discusses the danger of LAWS and the slow process of achieving international consensus on them \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **3. Capacity and Audience Building** 

 As part of the Create Converge project \(2016\-2020\), VFX techniques have been showcased to businesses and the public in the EU North Sea Region, raising the profile of these emergent technologies, facilitating collaboration and encouraging growth in non\-entertainment contexts. 

 Two 2017 events described in Section 2, **Zero Point VR** \(a VR installation held at the Barbican\) and **Aarhus Walks on Water** \(a live immersive technology event\), attracted over 600 and over 3,000 visitors respectively. The Aarhus event received an additional 400 viewings through a 360° VR live feed; an impact survey conducted by Aarhus University revealed the audience thought the event to be “particularly inspiring \(49%\), sensuous \(45%\) and funny \(35%\)”, and 72% considered it a “rethinking event” – demonstrating viewers’ reactions to this new technology. \[ **5.9; 5.10**\] 

 The **‘Visualising Creative Work \(VCW\)’** \(2017\-2019\) data visualisation project is a virtual reality map which allows the viewer to explore data on local creative industries in novel ways. It was disseminated at events across Denmark as a prototype. These events, particularly the workshop ‘ **VR Ready \- AR You?**’ led by Richardson \(250 attendees\), helped businesses identify opportunities for the use of VR in regional government, human resources, procurement, the Danish national health sector, design, TV and cinema. Businesses were asked if they would consider VR as a way of expanding their businesses and if key business issues could be solved via VR solutions. The responses were overwhelmingly positive with many businesses planning on incorporating VR into their existing business model, e.g.: “As a company we are now investigating VR as a way to allow juries to better understand complex circumstances of marine accidents in courtroom situations” – Managing Partner Solis Marine UK. Solis Marine have as of July 2020 commissioned six VR simulations which have been used in Marine Accident investigations in Malta, Gibraltar, UK and the Pacific. The VCW tool has since been expanded and developed further, with Dundee City Council/TayScreen reporting that: “The industrial communities of Create Converge partners Filmby Aarhus and Media Evolution each manage physical and virtual hubs for around 80 and over 400 companies respectively. The VCW provides invaluable visual data on companies and business relationships to inform potential business and collaboration opportunities. Examples include Mannd, Ate VR and Digital Devotion Games in Denmark; IKEA of Sweden AB, Beyond Innovation and W Communications Agency in Sweden” \[ **5.11**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Shahed Saleem’s research into the unique, and understudied, architectural type of the British mosque has resulted in several impacts: 

-  Enhanced Historic England’s preservation practice by enabling them to identify mosques for heritage listings, resulting in three new listings and the upgrading of two others, affording these buildings with protection for future generations. 

-  Integrated the contribution of British Muslims within the narrative of British culture and heritage, leading to greater appreciation of both the buildings and the community. 

-  Motivated the Muslim Council of Britain to engage with cultural preservation. 

-  Facilitated a major change in the V&A’s approach to its Islamic collection. 

-  Provided an exemplary model of direct educational engagement with the V&A collections. 

-  Enabled the V&A to meet its strategic aim of diversifying its audience base. 

-  Created a demonstrable sense of belonging and legitimacy for British Muslims. 

-  Broadening the field of architecture within academic study such that it is more inclusive.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Historic England commissioned Saleem in 2010 to undertake his project on the British mosque, which took 8 years to complete. As a practising architect, the first five years of research consisted of initial exploratory work and devising his research method. Upon joining University of Westminster in 2015, Saleem began focusing on specific mosques, honing his innovative research method into a template that allowed him to piece together a cohesive overall narrative of each building from a range of sources. The outcome of this work is Saleem’s 2018 monograph *The British Mosque: An architectural and social history*, which articulates the history, aesthetics, and urban development of Islamic architecture in Britain and is the first study of its kind \[1\]. 

 Despite its 120\-year presence in the country, there had been no previous study of the mosque as an architectural type in Britain. This is because architectural history has traditionally relied upon the existence of documentary evidence and accounts which chart the historical course of a particular building and from which a historical narrative can be constructed. Consequently, architectural history is largely constituted by buildings of social significance, as these are the ones for which such evidence exists. Further, these are, generally, exceptional examples of architectural fabric. The mosque in Britain is, for the most part, a wholly different type of building. Built by migrant communities whose settlement in Britain is relatively recent, there is little documentary evidence regarding both their lives and the buildings they have built. Mosques are largely community built and grassroots endeavors. They are largely self\-designed and built incrementally over a long period of time. In order to write an architectural history of such a dynamic building type, a new methodology of architectural history research and writing was required. 

 Saleem’s research method began with the use of digital media technologies. Saleem used Google Earth to identify the UK’s 1500 mosques and, from such aerial and “street view” images, categorised these buildings into three sub\-types: converted houses, adapted buildings, and purpose built. Given the lack of relevant documentation, for instance early photographs and drawings, in order to track the history of these buildings Saleem consulted both local council archives and online websites either managed by the mosque organisers or by persons independently documenting relevant materials for community purposes. Further, Saleem liaised with the mosques to search their own, usually uncatalogued, archives for planning materials. Through his background as an architect, Saleem was able to analyse such documents in a way as to reconstruct the process that underpinned the designing of the mosque and the manner in which the planning authorities were engaged. By undertaking building visits, and assessing alterations and extensions, he was also able to gauge how different the mosques now were from these initial plans. 

 In light of the minimal documentation, Saleem developed his method in two further ways, both innovative within the field of architecture. First, he consulted academic sources from the fields of history and sociology that address the situation of Muslims in Britain in a broader sense, allowing him to contextualise the architectural history of these buildings in accordance with information on regional migration and settlement patterns. Secondly, Saleem undertook and recorded interviews with various persons related to the mosques under examination, creating an oral history concerning the buildings. Any anachronisms, conflicts of remembrance, and new information arising from the recording of multiple voices and perspectives were followed up by Saleem in order to produce as rounded, and credible, an account as possible. Saleem’s methodology has thus provided a successful model for an emergent trend in architecture by which social and oral histories are drawn upon in order to provide architectural histories for buildings that are relatively new and used by migrants. 

 In short, the methodology deployed is novel in architectural history terms, and involves a combination of oral histories, planning records, local archive searches and mosque files. This innovation has been recognised in the field with his monograph being awarded a commendation in the RIBA \(Royal Institute of British Architects\)  [<ins>President’s Award</ins>](https://www.architecture.com/awards-and-competitions-landing-page/awards/riba-presidents-awards-for-research/2018/an-architectural-and-social-history-of-the-mosque-in-britain) for Research in 2018 in the category of History & Theory, being shortlisted in the Historic England Angel Award for Excellence in Architectural Research in 2018, and its shortlisting for the Society of Architectural Historians GB, Alice Davis Hitchcock Award 2019. 

 Extending out from his work in this celebrated monograph, Saleem drew upon his research base in order to further explore the manner in which the communal building of the mosque functions as a mediator for the identity of British Muslims \[2\]. Saleem narrativises the history of the mosque across twentieth\-century Britain and situates it as an intrinsic part of the exploration and articulation of post\-war Muslim diasporic identities, through which Muslims in Britain have negotiated both their global and local positionings. In this way, the mosque in Britain is characterised by Saleem as part of a complex entanglement between architecture, nationhood, and belonging. 

 Elsewhere, Saleem has examined, under a range of interpretive frameworks, the visual strategies employed by Muslim diasporas in Britain and Europe in the making of their mosques and explored the prospective role their diasporic relationship to Muslim history plays in the formulation of a Muslim visual culture \[3\]. Reflecting on his own practice as an architect, and drawing on his research into Muslim architectural history in Britain, Saleem presents the Shahporan mosque in East London, which he designed, as an example of how an alternative relationship to Muslim history and the manifestation of identity might emerge.

#  Cultural Impact through the Enhancement of Historic England’s Heritage Listings 

 <ins>According to Historic England’s Head of Communities Research: “The mainstream narratives of architecture and architectural history haven’t taken into account the contribution of mosques largely because nobody knows what’s there and where it is, so it’s kind of been invisible” \[a\-</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\].</ins> <ins>As</ins> <ins>the Head of Places of Worship Strategy at Historic England \(“Strategy Head” herein\) states,</ins> <ins>in</ins> <ins>order to</ins> <ins>correct this omission Saleem was “commissioned to improve understanding, recording and protection of places of worship. Historic England sought an overview and explanation of Islamic architecture in Britain, recording the buildings adapted and used by Muslim communities that have become part of England’s urban fabric” \[a\-ii\].</ins> 

 <ins>Highlighting Saleem’s research project as “</ins><ins> **a good example of external expertise bringing additional knowledge to Historic England” in a way that has enabled them to enhance their preservation practice**</ins><ins>, the Strategy Head states that Saleem’s creation of a geographical index of mosque buildings was especially useful: “From the gazetteer, Historic England was able to identify a number of the earliest or otherwise most interesting examples. In our capacity as adviser to the Secretary of State for DCMS \[Digital, Culture, Media & Sport\] we assessed these buildings and recommended them for Listing. \[…\] As a</ins> <ins>result</ins> <ins>in 2018 the Secretary of State agreed to list” and upgrade the listings of the mosques in the table below \[a\-ii\].</ins> 

| Mosque | Original Heritage Status | Change due to research |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shah Jahan Mosque in Woking \(1888\-89\) | Grade II\* | Grade I; identified as Britain’s first purpose\-built mosque |
| Salar Jung Memorial Hall, Woking | Not listed | Grade II |
| 8 Brougham Terrace, Liverpool | Grade II | Grade II\* |
| The London Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre in Regent’s Park \(1970\-77\) | Not listed | Grade II\* |
| The Fazl Mosque, Southfields \(1925\-26\) | Not listed | Grade II |
| 28\-32 Howard Street, Bradford | Grade II | List description amended to include the history of the building’s use as a mosque |

 <ins>As the Strategy Head points out: “Listing marks and celebrates a building's special architectural and historic interest, and also</ins> <ins> **brings it under the consideration of the planning system, so that it can be protected for future generations**</ins><ins>”; this is to say that Listing status confers the buildings</ins>  [<ins>official protection</ins>](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/listed-buildings/listing-and-the-erra/)<ins>, determining conservation requirements and controlling urban development interventions that could have negative impacts \[a\-ii\]. Listing status can also be crucial for</ins> <ins>attracting conservation and preservation funding.</ins> 

 <ins>The Listings of these mosques also has the broader cultural impact of</ins> <ins> **integrating the contribution of British Muslims within the narrative of British culture and heritage**</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>As Heritage Minister \(2018\-19\) Michael Ellis MP</ins> <ins>states: “Our historic buildings tell the story of Britain’s past and the people, places and events that shaped them. By listing these beautiful mosques, we are not only preserving important places of worship, but also celebrating the rich heritage of Muslim communities in England” \[a\-iii\]. This view is shared by the Historic England Strategy Head, who adds:</ins> <ins>“The project served to \[…\]</ins> <ins>recognise</ins> <ins>buildings of the Islamic faith for their national special interest and contribution to our built</ins> <ins>heritage, and</ins> <ins>promote wider public understanding of the buildings of Islamic faith in England. \[…\] As a result of the research we have</ins> <ins> **a far greater appreciation and insight of these buildings, their communities and role within British culture**</ins><ins>” \[a\-ii\].</ins> 

 <ins>This recognition of British Muslims’ cultural contribution has had both national and international reach</ins><ins>, with</ins> <ins>the announcement of these status upgrades resulting in over 30 press articles in across the globe \(from the</ins>  [<ins>BBC</ins>](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-43385587) <ins>and the</ins>  [<ins>Guardian</ins>](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/13/london-central-mosque-given-grade-ii-listed-status-historic-england) <ins>to the</ins>  [<ins>Hindustan Times</ins>](https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/two-mosques-in-london-awarded-heritage-status-in-a-bid-to-celebrate-the-rich-culture/story-01iTqNyrvXrGcUhESUovmK.html)<ins>, the</ins>  [<ins>Malay Mail</ins>](https://www.malaymail.com/news/life/2018/03/13/london-mosques-get-listed-status-celebrating-muslim-heritage/1597397)<ins>, and</ins>  [Al Arabiya](https://english.alarabiya.net/perspective/features/2018/03/25/More-mosques-being-given-heritage-status-in-UK-to-celebrate-history-of-Muslim-communities)<ins>\) \[a\-iv\]. The listings have also been reported on by numerous British Muslim community groups such as the</ins> Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Group <ins>and the London Central Mosque Trust \[a\-iv\]. In this connection, the Muslim Council of Britain \(MCB\) also</ins> <ins>emphasises</ins> <ins>that Saleem’s “research into the history of the mosque in Britain and the granting of heritage status to the selected mosques is of huge significance to the Muslim community as it is</ins> <ins> **the first time that the contribution of Muslims to the culture and architectural history of this country is formally and officially</ins> <ins>recognised**</ins><ins>” \[</ins><ins>a\-v</ins><ins>\].</ins> 

 <ins>Further, the above research and impacts it has achieved have</ins> <ins> **motivated the Muslim Council of Britain to engage with the cultural preservation of this community’s heritage**</ins><ins>: “Since the</ins> <ins>publication of the British Mosque, and the attention that it has brought to the built fabric of British Islam, the MCB has become a permanent member of the Historic England Places of Worship Forum. Through this position the MCB can advocate for mosques that are of historic significance and of heritage value” \[a\-iv\]. This change in the practice of its Research & Documentation Committee is such that: “This has led to the MCB developing a proposal for a comprehensive survey of the built fabric of mosques in Britain, which will be used to enhance Historic England’s records of heritage assets. Furthermore, the list descriptions of mosques that are in already listed buildings will be amended to include their history as mosques” \[</ins><ins>a\-v</ins><ins>\].</ins> 

#  <ins>Impact on Creativity via Collaboration with the V&A</ins> 

 <ins>The curators at the V&A \(Victoria and Albert Museum\) approached Saleem following the publication of output \[1\], because the “book highlighted a largely unknown part of the architectural history of Britain, and one that we felt needed to be platformed” \[b\-</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\]. Their collaboration has resulted in an installation at the museum, planned for 2021, which draws on “Saleem’s unparalleled expertise in this area, developed through his research for the book but also his work as architect for several mosques”, which “has been invaluable to both the intellectual framework of the pavilion, and to its design” \[b\-</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\]. The Assistant Curator in Designs at V&A add</ins><ins>s</ins><ins>: “Without his knowledge and network, an installation of this kind would not have been possible” \[b\-</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\].</ins> 

 <ins>The Ramadan Pavilion Saleem has “</ins><ins>conceptualised</ins> <ins>and designed” is considered “the V&A’s headline installation” for the London Festival of Architecture 2021 \[b\-</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\]. The Assistant Curator points out that it will have extensive reach to the public given that “\[a\]s part of the one\-way system installed to ensure the V&A is COVID secure, all visitors to the Museum will enter via this route, passing the pavilion as they enter” \[b\-</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\]. Saleem’s engagement with the V&A on the creation of this installation has had a significant impact in</ins> <ins>a number of</ins> <ins>ways.</ins> 

 <ins>It has impacted their creative practice,</ins> <ins> **marking a major change in the V&A’s approach to its Islamic collection**</ins><ins>: “Prior to Saleem’s collaboration with the V&A, the history of the mosque in Britain was not represented in the V&A’s collections or programming. Despite having one of the largest Islamic collections in the world, the culture of British Islam, has fallen between collections. Saleem’s book and his collaboration with the V&A have drawn attention to this hugely important part of the architectural and social history of Britain” \[b\-</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\].</ins> 

 <ins>It has also impacted on the V&A’s approach to its educational remit. Noting that the “V&A was established as an educational institution”, the Assistant Curator in Designs at the V&A states that: “</ins>The project that Saleem has facilitated with his students at the University of Westminster is **an exemplary model of direct engagement with the V&A’s collections for the purpose of contemporary design**” \[b\-i\]. The project involves Architecture students from Westminster collaborating in the design development of the installation as part of their coursework by engaging with the V&A collections, the curators, and with the architecture of the museum’s own building \[b\-ii\]. While the students have benefitted through this engagement and learning experience, so too have the V&A team: “With a subject as complex as Islamic architecture, it has been an enormous benefit to engage with the views of Saleem’s students. **The ideas of the students, and their diverse perspectives, has both challenged and strengthened the design of the pavilion, to the V&A’s benefit**” \[b\-i\]. 

 <ins>Further, the installation helps the museum to meet</ins> <ins>the V&A’s strategic aims “to diversify our audience base to reflect the wider local and international community” \[b\-</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\]. As per Saleem’s proposal, “the Ramadan Pavilion will serve as a hub for</ins> <ins>RTP’s</ins> <ins>events,</ins> <ins> **enabling the V&A to directly engage with the wider Muslim community**</ins><ins>. The pavilion will support and anchor an educational programme and a number of talks on the subject of contemporary Islamic architecture” and has given the curators “the opportunity to strengthen an existing relationship with the Muslim charity, Ramadan Tent Project \(RTP\), who as well as sponsoring the pavilion will be holding a series of events in the pavilion throughout Ramadan” \[b\-</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\].</ins> 

#  <ins>Social Impact via Broader Recognition of Muslim Contributions to British Culture</ins> 

 <ins>Saleem’s research and its related impacts have brought a minority, and often</ins> <ins>marginalised</ins><ins>, culture to the attention of broader audiences. The social impact of this is</ins> <ins>emphasised</ins> <ins>by the Muslim Council of Britain: “</ins><ins> **This recognition offers British Muslims a place in the history of the nation, and a provides them with a sense of belonging and legitimacy that is otherwise sorely lacking in public discourse**</ins><ins>. There are not many other spaces of public life where the</ins> <ins>contribution of Muslims to Britain’s life and culture is articulated in such an overwhelmingly positive way” \[</ins><ins>a\-v</ins><ins>\].</ins> 

 <ins>That Saleem’s research has created a sense of inclusion is evident from the following, unsolicited, testimonies from British Muslim architecture students who have written to Saleem from other institutions. For instance, one student wrote: “I was incredibly pleased to come across your book, thoroughly covering the history of Mosques in Britain, as this isn’t something that has been properly researched before. \[…\]</ins> <ins> **it is very refreshing and hopeful to see a successful modern academic bringing \[I\]slam in this field**</ins><ins>” \[c\-</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\]. Another student stated that: “Identity is an issue that British Muslim millennials, like</ins> <ins>myself</ins><ins>, continually struggle with, given the tug of war between religion, culture and nativity.</ins> <ins>However</ins> <ins>after reading this book I</ins> <ins>realised</ins> <ins>that parts of my identity were</ins> <ins>concretised</ins> <ins>in the walls, minarets and plaster of Mosques all over Britain. From seeing historical photographs of those that first stepped into a whole new culture, to reading about the developments of vernacular architectural style,</ins> <ins> **I became aware of my place in a timeline of an evolving subculture of British identity**</ins><ins>. This book instilled within me a</ins> <ins>new found</ins> <ins>respect for the 'traditional' yet helped me to understand what the future could look like. For the first time in my life, I felt proud of being the same, but also proud of being different” \[c\-</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\].</ins> 

 <ins>A graduate</ins> <ins>of</ins> <ins>another institution writes that: “Your research allowed me to feel liberated and empowered, amidst a time of great political friction between Islam and the West,</ins> <ins>\[it\]</ins> <ins>provided a positively refreshing moment to step back and appreciate the beautiful distribution of what the physical forms of a democracy, a free and fair Britain look like \- a young, but thorough history of Britain's Mosques. This collation of research allows for further discussion and recognition from a wider community, to see Islam under a different light which biased media propaganda has relentlessly prevented. This also</ins> <ins> **allows the BAME \[Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic\] architectural community to feel more inclusive and relevant in Architectural research and discussion**</ins><ins>, which is \[more\] crucial now than ever” \[c\-ii\].</ins> 

 <ins>As indicated, such social impact is also enabled through the broadening of the field of architecture within academic study such that it is more inclusive. This is communicated by a non\-Muslim student who writes: “In my research through New York University London, Saleem’s work was fundamental in understanding the broader context of British religious architecture beyond the Christian context and enabled me to create a more evenhanded discussion of religious identity and its manifestations in the built environment. Furthermore, his identification of absences within mainstream heritage recognition</ins> <ins> **paves the way for further exploration of how heritage representation could become more diverse and inclusive**</ins> <ins>by reexamining historic narratives and conceptions of fabric\-based heritage listing” \[c\-ii\].</ins>

##  1. Summary of the impact 

##  Financial institutions and government bodies have used the macroeconometric methods created by Strathclyde researchers to enhance regional and national policymaking in the UK, Europe and the USA. The new methods produced more accurate and timelier estimates of macroeconomic variables, including regional economic activity and inflation. Applications of the methods have strengthened the economic analysis undertaken by the UK Office for National Statistics, Scottish Fiscal Commission, Bank of England, European Central Bank, European Commission and US Federal Reserve Banks. Decision\-making within and beyond these bodies has been informed. Aspects of the research also augmented economic analysis and commentary disseminated to stakeholders and the public by global businesses \(e.g. PricewaterhouseCoopers\) and media outlets \(e.g. Financial Times\). 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 In the last twenty years, Macroeconometrics has been revolutionised to address two main challenges: the need to model changing relationships in the economy in unstable times; and the requirement to incorporate Big Data, the large and diverse data sources which are increasingly available in a digitised world. Responding to this, Strathclyde Business School has undertaken research to develop methods to forecast, to estimate the impact of policy interventions and, given the delays involved in collecting official data, to nowcast key indicators such as economic output and inflation. 

 This body of research uses the statistical modelling method called Vector Autoregression \(VAR\) which captures the relationship between different macroeconomic variables as they change over time. As VAR models impose few *a priori* restrictions on the interactions between macroeconomic variables, they are very flexible and typically exhibit good forecast performance. These models are therefore very popular with economists in government and central banks. However, new challenges have arisen in recent years as the size of VAR models has increased to capture dozens or even hundreds of variables. Given the large number of model parameters to be estimated, this leads to over\-parameterisation problems which diminishes the accuracy of forecasts produced and can make the model challenging to estimate. 

 In collaboration with co\-researchers, Professor Gary Koop created new Bayesian estimation methods based on shrinkage priors to overcome over\-parameterisation problems. This approach was found to perform well in a substantive empirical evaluation of its forecast accuracy \[ **R1**\]. Alongside this, Koop established alternative approaches to address the over\-parameterisation problem using data compression. A notable example of this was the creation \(working with Professor Korobilis, University of Glasgow\) of a new financial conditions index \(FCI\) to accurately track expectations about growth in key US macroeconomic variables. This was achieved using factor augmented VAR models with time\-varying coefficients and stochastic volatility which allowed information in a large number of financial variables to be compressed into a smaller number of variables \[ **R2**\]. A subsequent empirical comparison study involving data sets with up to 129 macroeconomic variables, demonstrated that compressed VAR methods had computational advantages and forecast at least as well as either factor methods or large VAR methods involving prior shrinkage \[ **R3**\]. 

 Responding to the particular challenges of non\-traditional Big Data sources, such as internet search data, Koop collaborated with the European Central Bank to develop a novel dynamic model selection \(DMS\) methodology. This allows for model switching \(when a set of models exist and one is selected real\-time from the set to make forecasts\) to be controlled by variables constructed using Google data \(termed ‘Google probabilities’ to indicate their active role\). Tested through an empirical exercise involving nine major monthly US macroeconomic variables, the results showed that, in general, DMS methods provide large improvements in nowcasting and the use of Google probabilities often further increases performance \[ **R4**\]. Within the context of unstable economic conditions, further research with Korobilis demonstrated that building parameter and volatility change into a large VAR model can result in well\-calibrated predictive densities providing important information about forecast uncertainty. 

 Motivated by a need for timelier and more frequent estimates of regional economic growth for policymakers, Strathclyde led an Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence \(ESCoE\) project to develop VAR modelling methods which enabled the ONS to produce faster estimates of regional GDP in response to fiscal devolution and the ‘levelling\-up’ agenda. In undertaking VAR modelling at regional, rather than national, level two key challenges arise. First regional GDP data is released at a lower frequency \(e.g. quarterly or annually\), with a release delay of around 6\-12 months. Second, there is a relatively short time\-series of regional data available. To address these challenges, Koop and McIntyre developed VAR models capable of handling data of different frequencies. These mixed\-frequency VAR models embodied new features unique to this situation and provide a means of producing faster indicators of regional economic activity at a higher frequency \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. Further, through application of the new methods to historical data, this research also produced estimates of quarterly regional growth dating back to 1970 and commented on the evolution of this growth across the UK regions.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 By advancing macroeconometric methods to provide more accurate and timely information, Strathclyde has enhanced regional and national policymaking in the UK, Europe and USA. Specifically, the research led by Professor Koop and Dr McIntyre has: 

-  Supported analysis and decision\-making to address regional imbalances in the UK economy by creating improved estimates of regional economic activity; 

-  Enhanced national and regional economic policy\-making by strengthening macroeconometric analysis within UK, European and US financial institutions and government bodies. 

###  Improved estimates of regional economic activity in the UK 

 As reflected in recent parliamentary inquiries, regional inequality is a pressing concern in the UK. With the Covid\-19 pandemic exacerbating existing imbalances, the levelling up agenda has become firmly established and the demand for timely regional statistics to inform decision\-making has increased. Seeking to support policymakers to drive and direct economic development at regional and devolved levels, over the last five years the **Office for National Statistics** has expanded its data sources and outputs. This includes producing regional GDP figures to provide a more granular breakdown of the UK economy. Initially released annually with a lag of almost a year, the ONS drew on VAT administrative data and other sources to produce quarterly regional estimates from 2019, reducing the lag in data acquisition to six months. It then drew on Strathclyde’s established research expertise through an ESCoE project to improve the timeliness and frequency of regional growth estimates further \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. Confirming this, the ONS notes: ‘to demonstrate that ONS can adapt to the needs of the modern user and help policymaking…we made the decision to adopt the approach developed by the Strathclyde team, to help produce faster estimates of regional growth using their econometric model, and all of the regional growth data that we produce \(both annual and quarterly\). What this has meant in practice is that we have worked with the Strathclyde team to embed their research and model within our methods. Specifically, and as part of the Levelling up strategy, the ONS has replicated the Strathclyde approach within the ONS production environment, with detailed plans to bring the nowcasting work of Strathclyde University into regular production’ \[ **S1**\]. As well as meeting with the ONS monthly ‘to discuss feasibility aspects and clarify any points around the method and outputs’, Strathclyde has ‘delivered comprehensive tailored training to explain the approach in detail to the ONS staff’ \[ **S1**\]. 

 The importance of this new approach to estimating regional growth is apparent in the written submissions made by ONS to the **Treasury** Committee’s inquiry on regional imbalances in the UK economy \(2019\) and the **Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy** Committee’s inquiry on post\-pandemic economic growth: levelling up local and regional structures and the delivery of economic growth \(2020\). Setting out the range of regional economic data that are currently available as an evidence base for regional policymaking, both sets of evidence refer to the Strathclyde\-led ESCoE project \(the outputs from which underpin **R5** and **R6**\), explaining that it ‘has developed a model\-based approach to provide early views of regional economic activity, known as “nowcasts”’ which will enable the ONS to ‘provide a “flash” estimate similar to the UK’s early estimate of GDP”’ in support of the levelling up agenda \[ **S2a**, **S3**\]. The value of this work is further emphasised by the Director General of the **Office of Statistics Regulation** who wrote to the Chair of the Treasury Committee following his inquiry appearance to outline ‘the pathways towards providing enhanced regional economic statistics and their inclusion in official publication’. Listing nowcasts of regional GDP as one of four ‘building blocks for improved regional economic statistics’, he highlighted the fact that ‘HM Treasury does not currently include much by way of regional economic breakdowns in their budget report’ and suggested that ‘there might be considerable public good served by publishing some regional economic forecasts’ \[ **S2b**\]. 

 This research also benefitted the devolved nations directly. For instance, Strathclyde’s nowcasting model \[ **R5**, **R6**\] has been used by the **Scottish Fiscal Commission** since 2017 to produce regular economic forecasts for Scotland. According to the Commission’s Chief Executive, ‘“now casting” the Scottish economy has helped us bridge the ragged edge between outturn data and the forecasts produced by our structural economic model. Since we started producing economic forecasts in 2017 we have made use of now casts produced by a model based on the Strathclyde approach’ \[ **S4**\]. Stressing that ‘it has been reassuring to know that the work is based on rigorous econometric foundations developed at Strathclyde’, he notes how much the Commission ‘appreciated the initial conversations with the Strathclyde team when we were building the now casting model’ \[ **S4**\]. 

 In addition, the ESCoE research \[ **R5**, **R6**\] was used by businesses, broadcasters and the press to produce economic analysis and commentary to increase public and stakeholder understanding of regional economic growth. For instance, the macroeconomics team at **PricewaterhouseCoopers \(PwC\)**, utilised the ‘new set of estimates of quarterly and annual regional growth dating back as far as 1972 that has been published by ESCoE’ alongside ONS data on real output growth by region to explain the ‘increasing economic growth divide between London and other regions’ \[ **S5a**\]. This was published in PwC’s UK Economic Outlook report which is circulated to the company’s global network of firms as part of its Connected Intelligence programme. The **Financial Times** also drew on the estimates, emphasising ‘the importance of the ESCoE exercise’ in addressing the limitations of existing regional economic data which is no longer relevant by the time it is published \[ **S5b**\]. Referring to the regional recession which hit the north east of England in 2016, commentary produced in November 2018 observed that ‘policymakers did not learn about this contraction until December last year and, even then, only a growth figure for the year as a whole was published’. Outlining how ‘ESCoE have tried to solve this problem by using econometric techniques to develop a “nowcast’, the article draws attention to the fact that ‘just two weeks after official data suggested the UK was growing at an annual rate of 1.6 per cent, the ESCoE nowcast indicates the north east is growing at roughly half that rate, or 0.8 per cent’ \[ **S5b**\]. The value of these nowcasts to policymakers, if they choose to act, was stressed. 

 **Strengthened econometric analysis within financial institutions and government bodies** 

 As illustrated by the following examples, application of Strathclyde’s modelling methods by financial institutions and government bodies in the UK, Europe and the USA has enhanced national and regional economic policy\-making. Strengthening inflation trend analysis and forecasting has been particularly beneficial, enabling timely interventions to be made. 

####  Bank of England 

 To support ongoing analysis of global economic trends, the Bank of England drew directly on Koop’s index of financial conditions research \[ **R2**\] to calculate its own Financial Conditions Indices \(FCIs\) ‘to summarise information from the following financial series: term spreads, Interbank spreads, corporate spreads, sovereign spreads, long\-term interest rates, policy rates, equity price returns, equity volatility, house price returns and credit growth’ \[ **S6a,b**\]. This has enabled it to conduct analyses to monitor global economic and financial market developments. For example, in 2018 the FCIs based on Koop’s index were used to analyse global financial conditions \(showing they had tightened but remained accommodative overall\) \[ **S6a**, pp.3,7\] and to calculate financial conditions in non\-China emerging market economies \(evidencing a tightening\) \[ **S6a** pp.6\-8\]. These findings were set out in the Bank’s inflation reports for August and November which informed the interest rate decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee. 

####  European Central Bank and European Commission 

 Building on earlier ESRC\-funded collaborative research \[ **S7a**\], in 2019 Professor Koop worked with the European Central Bank \(ECB\) Business Cycle Analysis Division to evaluate the importance of the Phillips curve, the standard theoretical and empirical benchmark showing the relationship between real activity and inflation, following the financial crisis. Published in a ECB working paper to support policy deliberations and decision\-making within European institutions, this research confirmed the existence of a Phillips curve in the euro area and provided reassurance that it ‘is still a valid policy instrument once it is robustly estimated’ \[ **S7b**\]. Reflecting on the importance of this work, the ECB Senior Economist who was involved \(now a project leader at the European Commission\) notes that ‘Prof. Koop has contributed to a major breakthrough in forecasting and modelling’ \[ **S5**\]. As well as being used ‘routinely to handle large quantities of data’, his techniques have and continue to be ‘directly applied to the analysis of the Phillips curve and price dynamics, and provide an important and increasing contribution to the forecasting framework of the ECB, more and more relying on Big Data frameworks’. Significantly, ‘the ECB’s forecasting framework is the main process that informs policy reports and Central Bank communication, and provides advice to the Executive Board’ \[ **S8**\]. The recognised value of Koop’s research \[ **R3**, **R4**\] to European policy\-making is also apparent from his inclusion in a ‘specially constituted Nowcasting group currently monitoring economic developments in real time during the COVID\-19 crisis’ \[ **S8**\]. The Project Lead at the European Commission \(formerly the ECB Senior Economist\) confirms that Koop’s ‘Model Averaging techniques are at the moment the backbone of our Nowcasting framework, and they allow to combine the information stemming from different models and from the use of traditional and large quantities of Big Data to produce a weekly update of the nowcast to be sent to DG\-ECFIN and to the Cabinets’ \[ **S8**\]. The Directorate‑General for Economic and Financial Affairs \(DG\-ECFIN\) is the Commission department responsible for EU policies promoting economic growth and recovery, higher employment, stable public finances and financial stability. Attesting to its broader relevance and application, aspects of this work have recently been published in a European Central Bank working paper to inform analysis and policy\-making \[ **S7c**\]. 

####  Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and New York 

 Koop’s research \[ **R1**, **R2**\] has also supported econometric analysis and policy\-making within two of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks in the USA. These form part of the Federal Reserve System which serves as a central bank for the USA with the aim of providing stable monetary policy and a safe and flexible financial system. According to the former Director of Economic Research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \(1998\-2019\) who ‘was responsible for briefing the Bank President for the Federal Open Market Committee meetings, the policy meeting of the Federal Reserve’, inflation research conducted with Koop ‘allowed me to provide timely and insightful analysis of a number of critical issues’ \[ **S9**\]. The Head of the Macroeconomics Group within the Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, also acknowledges the ‘tremendous value and influence’ of Koop’s research, specifically the development of a new model ‘for assessing trends in inflation and forecasting future inflation’ \[ **S10**\]. Stretching its influence nationally, he notes that, ‘our model has also been used in a number of other central bank studies of inflation trends and forecasts’ to inform economic policy\-making \[ **S10**\].

1.  **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 **Storey** is the first person to be appointed United Nations High Commission for Refugees \(UNHCR\) Artist in Residence, based at Za’atari refugee camp in Jordan \(2019\). Her extensive body of evidence\-based practice research has had global impact at political and individual levels, in particular, on the understanding of the relationship between climate breakdown and the global migration of people. **Storey**’s established practice of using fashion to engage people in complex global challenges continues to bring together artists and scientists with a view to sharing with public, education and professional audiences contemporary issues in science in ways that create new types of engagement. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 UAL’s relationship with the University of Sheffield, through **Storey** and Professor Tony Ryan OBE, Professor of Physical Chemistry, was cemented through a collaborative project that explored how clothing and textiles can be used as a catalytic surface to purify air \(Catalytic Clothing, 2011–2016\). This ongoing partnership brings together art and design with science, and has produced a sustained programme of research work; most pertinent to this case study being the work at Za’atari \(the largest refugee camp in the Middle East, home to 78,000 refugees\). 

 For **Storey**, whose research is located within socially situated practice, fashion is employed not as a commodity but as a vehicle to change the way that we think—as individuals, and as organisations and institutions. Supported by UAL, **Storey**’s engagement with connecting fashion and science has continued since 2014, through *Dress for Our Time* \( *D4OT*\), and projects resulting from her Artist in Residence role at Za’atari. 

 In 2012, UAL was approached by the UK MET Office to participate in a programme exploring the impact of climate change in different industries, with specific reference to the future of the fashion industry. This work sharpened **Storey**’s focus on exploring how, in conjunction with science, fashion, art and design might lead to a wider understanding of the climate crisis, and open up to audiences including artists, scientists and the public, ways to consider the relationship between this and global migration. 

 *Dress For Our Time* \(‘the dress’\) came out of this work. \[3.1.\] A focus for an approach and a set of methods to illustrate complex concerns, to provoke responses and to change behaviour, the dress was conceived as a way to humanise refugee data. A symbolic garment made from a gifted, decommissioned UNHCR tent, the concept was initiated, developed and led by **Storey**. The collaborative project involved more than 100 people and 15 partners, including pattern\-maker Mark Tarbard and UAL technicians. Researching the type of garment that would be suitable for the project, the solution—using a refugee tent as its foundation—resulted from a recognition that, rather than creating a new piece of clothing onto which information might be projected digitally, what was required was a textile that had humanity and history already embedded in its fibres. UNHCR Jordan supplied the tent—once home to a family of six who had fled Syria for Jordan in 2012, and who were living in Za’atari. Data extracted from a MET Office global study of the risks arising from future shifts in ecosystems were visualised digitally on the dress, depicting our planet in 2015 and as it will be if insufficient action is taken to combat climate breakdown. 

 *D4OT* has taken multiple platforms and forms, being an interactive, performative and activist work that speaks to the contemporary social milieu, supporting other related research projects in the various situations in which it was installed, or performed as a work that bears witness ‘to our times’. The *D4OT* project led to an extensive programme of research and collaborative work at Za’atari, outlined below.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 The impact of **Storey**’s work is both at a personal level, reaching individuals and small groups, and at scale, with audiences \(physical and digital\) for individual projects regularly in the tens of thousands. Since 2014, **Storey** has been awarded Honorary Professor at University of Bournemouth, appointed an RDI \(Royal Designer for Industry, 2014\), appointed the first Designer in Residence at the College of Human Ecology, Cornell University \(2016\), followed by the appointment as UNHCR Artist in Residence at Za’atari \(2019\). 

 The *D4OT* project has had a number of iterations, displayed in public places at times of social significance. The first installation of the dress was at St Pancras International, London \(26–29 November 2015\), at the entrance to Eurostar. The location was key to the project as the staging was timed to coincide with the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP21, in Paris. Through the world’s first digital couture dress, delegates passing through the station were confronted with a digital depiction of climate breakdown and its human impact. 

 The dress was positioned to capture the attention of the maximum number of people passing through St Pancras international—politicians and decision\-makers travelling to COP21, as well as the general public. Audience numbers: 1,204 visitors \(actual\); 136,600 \(Twitter and Facebook combined\); social media reach to over 289,000 \(1,600 Instagram ‘likes’\); online media coverage: 180 million unique page views. There was extensive media coverage in newspapers, magazines and online totalling over 207 million unique visitors per month. To date, *D4OT* has over 2,000 followers on Instagram and 4,500 on Twitter. Network Rail commented “It was great having the Dress For Our Time at the station and I feel that the event brought a very important message about the future environmental concerns to the forefront, and need for action towards sustainability.” \[5.1.\] 

 At the Science Museum, London \(August–September 2016\), the second major installation, the dress was shown as part of the museum’s *Our Lives in Data* exhibition. UNHCR data was used to visualise global migration, with each pixel of light representing 100 migrating people. Head of Exhibitions and Programmes at the Science Museum: “The beauty of the display and the use of visually appealing moving representation of large\-scale data drew visitors to it. Once engaged with *Dress For Our Time*, the installation evoked an immediate and personal response in our visitors…”. For this iteration, visitors were interviewed by invigilators in the gallery: “… so different to when we watch the news on TV, although the information itself might be the same.” “A work of art that beautifully, heartbreakingly and unflinchingly expresses the reality of the refugee crisis.” “…this was a great way to address an issue like this… it was human and beautiful.” \[5.2.\]. 

 Further appearances of *D4OT* followed. By invitation of UNHCR, it was shown, with the *D4OT* film as the backdrop, to the UN Geneva TEDX conference ‘Transforming Lives’ \(The Grand Palais, Geneva, 11 February 2016\), trailed on Twitter as “A refugee tent from Za’atari given a second life to send a powerful message at TEDxNations”. Live audience: 1,000; 21 live viewing parties worldwide: 3,000\+ viewers. *D4OT* project ambassador Louise Owen explained some of the reactions to the dress: “Everyone responded really positively to it. Its presence created a lot of intrigue about the whole project.” \[5.3.\] 

 Rokia Traoré, Malian singer\-songwriter and UNHCR Regional Goodwill Ambassador for West and Central Africa, wore the dress when performing on The Pyramid Stage to open Glastonbury Festival \(24 June 2016\). “There’s no better place than Glastonbury to wear the incredible *Dress For Our Time*. We’re in the middle of a huge pop\-up tented city and I’m wearing a dress made from a UNHCR tent, which sheltered a Syrian refugee family for months. I’ve seen myself the work of UNHCR supporting refugees from Mali and the difference that shelter can make to people who have lost their homes… I stand with refugees; will you stand with me?” *D4OT* appeared at No. 10 Downing Street \(27 September 2019\) as part of the London Climate strike, at the first ever London Peace Talks \(3 November 2016\) and at the Venice Biennale 2019. 

 Media coverage of the dress has been extensive, consistently reaffirming its message. Lucy Siegle, *The Guardian \(*daily average unique browsers: 7 million\) commented: “It’s rare that there’s a piece of fashion which is designed not to influence what you buy but to shift the way you think. It’s even rarer to find a piece created to promote the discussion of climate science. But that’s Helen Storey for you.” \[5.4.\] Working with fashion celebrity Lou Teasdale, who has 4.2 million Instagram followers, and using the hash tag ‘Look Mum No Future’, a social media campaign for the dress was launched to engage the public. More recently, an interview with *Times Higher Education* \[5.5.\] gave **Storey** a platform to describe her work—including the dress—and the most recent UKRI\-funded project designing and distributing PPE across Za’atari. 

 During *D4OT* at St Pancras International, many children and young people asked incisive questions about the dress, often about the family that used to live in the tent. Feeling that the answers to these questions were important to public understanding of the issues communicated through the dress and, in order to answer them, **Storey** visited Za’atari refugee camp \(March 2016\). Her work there ran for nearly three years, when the relationship was formalised, with **Storey**’s appointment as UNHCR’s first Artist in Residence, at Za’atari. The invitation came on the basis of the work that she had carried out at the camp, which UNHCR Jordan said has, “…promoted refugee women’s emerging role by delivering new opportunities, driving innovation and contributing to improving life in the camp for the communities we engage with.” \[5.6.\]. 

 The reach and significance of **Storey**’s work is demonstrated by her academic and professional reputation. She is invited regularly to collaborate with partners and maintains long\-term relationships across extensive, complex projects. **Storey**’s ability to bring relevant partners together with UAL is evidenced in the following examples. For *D4OT,* she gathered a group of 15 collaborators, including UNHCR \(UK and Jordan\), Unilever, MET Office, Science Museum and St Pancras International; **Storey**’s 15\-year\-old ongoing collaboration with Sheffield University on a range of projects, including the current UKRI\-funded \(through the UK Government’s Global Challenges Research Fund and the Newton Fund\), 18\-month project \(£800,000, from August 2020\), ‘People’s PPE: Dealing with a Crisis by Building Livelihoods in Za’atari Refugee Camp’, also known as ‘PPE4Refugees’ *.* By the end of 2020, this project, which involved a number of NGOs and two Jordanian Universities had designed and distributed 60,000 face masks. To reflect the potential and achievements of the collaboration, hand in hand with the refugee population, a five\-year Memorandum of Understanding \(MOU\) between UNHCR, University of Sheffield and UAL was signed in 2017. 

 **Storey**’s methodology at Za’atari has been to co\-define and co\-create works, using ‘deep listening’ and problem\-solving to improve the lives of the refugees in situ and in real time, rather than bringing pre\-held approaches, or design methodologies, or pre\-conceived ideas as to how the relationship would work. The projects across the camp have a clear focus on women and young girls. The examples of the projects at Za’atari chosen for this case study are the ‘Soap and Perfume Making Lab’ \(in partnership with Swiss multi\-national company, Givaudan\) and ‘The Tiger Girls’ \(These Inspiring Girls Enjoy Reading\). 

 Part of a larger Za’atari initiative, Made in Za’atari—a lab space co designed for training and the production of products, crafts, a Hydroponics Garden \(with Sheffield University\), a beauty salon, a crèche, a café and a retail/gallery space, to sell produce to the camp and to camp visitors—the soap and perfume making project brought a group of Givaudan employees from France, Dubai and Egypt to provide training for groups of women to make and sell fragranced soap \(100 women over the period\). A member of the Givaudan team commented: “Working with the women in Za’atari has been an inspiration to all the Givaudan team. Their enthusiasm and resilience in the face of extreme hardship, their desire to learn and determination to build a better future for their families is incredible. They have a lot to teach us.” \[5.7.\] 

 **Storey**’s ability to create productive relationships is evident in the soap\-making initiative, where she has made links with local industry to upscale production. In a related initiative, the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is working on an experimental project looking at the impact on hand hygiene for children if a toy is buried in soap; a local industrial partner in Jordan has been found to manufacture the soaps, involving the trained Za’atari women in the production. 

 At least 10,000 of the 80,000 refugees at Za’atari are adolescent girls. The Tiger Girls are a group of young women \(aged nine–17\) who engage in a programme of high\-quality learning in order to provide an alternative to early marriage. The greatest long\-term impact is on the girls—and now boys—engaged in the programme. LOVECOATS is a collaborative project through which the girls designed and made coats for themselves around their specific needs and wishes \(to be warm in winter, to learn new making skills, to enjoy their love of fashion, to have something to gift\). The co\-design workshop format brought together other makers, NGOs and camp teachers and, in July 2016, they worked with 29 girls, teaching new making skills to create coats which reflected their own identities and sense of self. “Now I know I am important because I got to make my own coat and I walked on the catwalk. I feel confident.” \[5.8.\] 

 Film has played a key part in the recording and dissemination of **Storey**’s work, including *Dress For Our Time: The Next Chapter* by David Betteridge. The films also form a crucial part of the development of the projects, central to **Storey**’s work at Za’atari, showing the complex and detailed work taking place there in compelling and illuminating ways. In 2020, the cameras were given over to the refugees to record their own lives. The films are used by the UNHCR to communicate the work, with the film made around the soap\-making project reported as the most watched UNHCR film for years, while the camp manager has had the most requests for how that project was set up than any other initiative. Za’atari is one of the most visited UNHCR camps, with visits from the Jordanian Royal Family and members of government, and international dignitaries. UNHCR officers visit from around the world, to see how Za’atari is managed and to understand how it has become so innovative. 

 The work at Za’atari continues, developing and expanding established projects and creating new initiatives, with ongoing impact on the lives of the individuals who live there.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Public sector bodies need effective methods to evaluate long\-term returns on spending in areas such as environmental protection. National and international bodies have used Professor Mark Freeman’s research on intergenerational social discount rates \(SDRs\) to underpin their valuation of long\-term assets. The methods and recommendations arising from this work have been adopted by HM Treasury in its *Green Book* instructions to all UK government departments; by the Dutch government’s *Green Book* equivalent; by the UK’s Office for National Statistics for valuation of long\-term assets in the national accounts; and by the New York State Government’s Department of Environmental Conservation for estimating the value of reducing carbon and other greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions. Freeman’s work has also been widely cited in policy documents of governments and national and international agencies. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 HM Treasury’s *Green Book* notes that “society as a whole... prefers to receive goods and services sooner rather than later”. This is why a government will place a lower value on a future benefit for each year that it expects to wait to receive it. 

 Social discount rates \(SDRs\) quantify the magnitude of this effect. Because of the compounding effects of interest, the economic values that governments place today on long\-term projects are extremely sensitive to the precise choice of SDR. For example, if the SDR is 1% then a government will place a value of GBP60.80 today on a project that will deliver GBP100 of benefits in 50 years’ time \(calculated as 100/1.01<sup>50</sup>\); yet if the SDR increases only slightly, to 3%, the value placed today on the same project is much lower, at GBP22.81 \(calculated as 100/1.03<sup>50</sup>\). 

 This sensitivity of valuation to the choice of SDR is of significant concern to governmental bodies, because many of the pressing problems facing society today – including climate\-change mitigation – have very long\-term consequences. For these reasons, determining the intergenerational SDR has been described as “one of the most critical problems in all of economics” \(Weitzman, 2001\). 

 One of the two broad approaches to determining the SDR, the ‘positivist’ method, states that it should reflect rates of return offered by other investments, particularly government bonds. This approach requires an understanding of asset pricing theory, and it is primarily from this financial angle that Freeman has contributed to the literature in his research conducted at Loughborough. Freeman works with co\-authors – most notably Groom \(LSE/Exeter\) – who mainly specialise in the alternative ‘normative’ approach, which states that the SDR should be determined by considering more philosophically the ethics of intergenerational equity. 

 The ‘term structure’ of SDRs plots the relationship between the SDR and the maturity of the project being appraised. The Freeman/Groom team has contributed extensively to the ‘declining discount rates’ \(DDRs\) literature, which argues that this term structure should be downward\-sloping, with lower discount rates applied to longer\-lived assets. 

 The team’s econometric estimation of the real interest rate process, with particular emphasis on the inflation component, constructed a new positivist declining term structure of SDRs. Previous research had mixed real \(inflation\-adjusted\) and nominal data, and this work was the first to resolve this inconsistency **\[R1\]**. 

 Further research across a number of different theoretical frameworks proved that in practice it is essentially impossible to empirically estimate with precision the rate at which the term structure of SDRs should decline. This work established the hypersensitivity of intergenerational SDRs to small changes in econometric assumptions **\[R2\]**. Freeman also applied DDRs for the first time in a full\-cost accounting framework to the valuation of environmental assets **\[R3\]**. 

 In addition, Freeman co\-authored what is primarily a review paper on DDRs, with a clear focus on potential policy applications **\[R4\]**. The paper formed part of one of the very few 2014 American Economic Association conference sessions to be webcast and then placed on the AEA website; the session was chaired by Lord Stern and discussed by Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow. 

 Freeman’s research at Loughborough also resulted in a 2018 *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy* article that is extensively used as the go\-to survey of expert opinion on intergenerational SDRs **\[R5\]**. As well as describing the range of views held by experts, the article provides a conceptual understanding of why there is such strong disagreement on this issue. Reconciling differences in expert opinions into ‘consensus’ SDRs, Freeman’s work has also shown that the speed with which the term structure declines depends crucially on whether experts are taking a positive or normative position on social discounting **\[R6\]** – providing a key critique of one of the main papers in this field.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Freeman’s research on long\-term discount rates applicable to environmental and other policies has been cited in documents produced by governmental and other agencies around the world between 2014 and 2020. This is due partly to his participation in conferences with policymakers and to reports based on research that he has authored or co\-authored for national and international organisations **\[S1\]**. 

 In the US Freeman’s work has contributed to a report by the prestigious National Academies of Science, Engineering & Medicine, a Council of Economic Advisers briefing to the Obama Administration and an Institute of Policy Integrity report on emissions standards. His research has also been cited in economic and environmental policy documents of the German, Irish, New Zealand and Rwandan governments, by the European Commission and by the OECD. Freeman presented twice in 2016 to the Home Office Contest counter\-terrorism team on the cost\-benefit case for long\-term de\-radicalisation programmes. The Home Office Head of Counter\-Terrorism Strategy and Performance later stated: “The points you made about different approaches to cost\-benefit analysis and counter\-terrorism helped us with our own thinking on the matter.” **\[S1\]** 

 As well as this reach, full details of which can be accessed via the links listed in **S1**, the significance of the impact of Freeman’s work is demonstrated by the examples below. 

  

 *• **Setting of the discount rates used in cost\-benefit analysis methods prescribed by the UK Treasury’s Green Book in 2018 and 2020** 

 In 2018 HM Treasury reissued its *Green Book*, the guidance that covers a huge range and volume of public sector investment decisions and prioritisation. The guidance “applies to all proposals that concern public spending, taxation, changes to regulations and changes to the use of existing public assets and resources... \[and\] all government departments, arm’s\-length public bodies with responsibility derived from central government for public funds and regulatory authorities” \(2018 *Green Book* foreword\). As part of the update, HM Treasury undertook a detailed review of whether the discount rates used in the previous edition remained appropriate, including its use of DDRs. 

 Following two workshops with HM Treasury, Freeman, with Groom and Spackman, authored a detailed report on this topic **\[S2\]**. This was the only academic supplementary guidance to the *Green Book* published online by HM Treasury. It cited and used all the underpinning research except R3, and provided the academic support to the discounting recommendations given in the *Green Book*. In 2020 the lead author of the *Green Book* at HM Treasury stated: “Mark Freeman’s contribution has been central to this important area of public concern, and his advice, backed up by his research, has been important in informing how we set and apply public sector discounting in the challenging times from the 2008 financial crisis right up until the present.” **\[S3\]** 

 The Chancellor announced in his 2020 Budget statement a further review of the *Green Book*, on which Freeman was consulted. The lead author of the *Green Book* at HM Treasury stated: “Current considerations concerning uneven development within the UK make research in the area of social discounting doubly important, and we expect to be consulting Mark Freeman again this year” **\[S3\]**. In the 2020 edition of the *Green Book*, Freeman’s work was again prominent, and the 2018 report with Groom and Spackman formed a key part of the justification for the discount rate \( **S4,** see especially Section 14\). 

 *• **Setting of the discount rates used in cost\-benefit analysis methods prescribed by the Netherlands government in 2015 and 2020** 

 In 2015 Freeman gave expert advice on long\-term social discounting to a working group of the Ministry of Finance, Netherlands. The government subsequently stated \(translated\): “The Cabinet accepts all the recommendations of the working group... \[and\] has as its starting point that this advice is followed in all policy areas where discounting is involved.” 

 The Ministry’s response was further updated in 2020 and it again extensively used Freeman’s research, including reproducing some of **R5**’s Figures **\[S5\],** as well as the detailed report used by HM Treasury **\[S2\]**, in justification of the long\-term discount rate now widely and compulsorily used across the Netherlands government. In December 2020 the Programme Leader stated: “The Dutch government has accepted all recommendations of the advice on the discount rate. As a result, the advised discount rate is now mandatory in all government cost\-benefit analyses and other policy assessment where discounting plays a role. Cost\-benefit analysis is widely used to inform policy decisions in the Netherlands.” **\[S6\]** 

 *• **Setting of the discount rate applied by the UK Office for National Statistics in the valuation of long\-lived assets in the UK national accounts** 

 In 2016 the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) began a review of the values used for different types of long\-term liabilities and assets in the UK national accounts. The aim was to ensure that appropriate discount rates were set within a common framework and that they could be easily explained and justified. To this end, the ONS commissioned two reports from Freeman and colleagues. 

 With Groom, Freeman authored a 2016 report on the valuation of environmental assets. This was cited in the *UK natural capital accounts methodology guide: October 2019* \(page 5\): “Based on an extensive review by external consultants, the ONS and Defra use the social discount rate set out in the HM Treasury *Green Book*.” In 2017 Freeman and colleagues conducted an external review of the discount rates that the ONS should use in the production of its outputs, resulting in a report that covered a wide range of long\-lived assets. The Deputy Director and Deputy Chief Economist at the ONS commented in 2019: “By providing transparency on the options available and how historic decisions have been taken, this work has helped validate the discount rates used in the national accounts in 2019, delivering a key support to maintaining and implementing the current methodologies.” **\[S7\]** 

 *• **Informing the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation’s guidance on estimating the value of reducing carbon and other GHG emissions** 

 New York State has a population of more than 19 million. In 2020 its Department of Environmental Conservation issued a guidance document to all New York government agencies about calculating the social cost of carbon and other GHG emissions **\[S8\]**. 

 Endorsed by Governor Cuomo, the guidance argued that the discount rates used by the Federal Inter\-agency Working Group underestimated the value of avoided damages from GHG emissions. A new monetary value was therefore established for avoided emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Freeman’s work \(especially **R5**\) was cited as the primary justification for its policy that the social cost of carbon should be calculated at a discount rate of 1\-3% instead of the Federal range of 2.5\-5% **\[S8\]**. In 2020 the Economics Director at the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University noted that Freeman’s work would “directly lead to New York taking more aggressive climate action.” **\[S9\]** 

 *• **Other engagement with decision\-making bodies** 

 In 2020, with Freeman, with Groom and Turk, delivered a report commissioned by the International Seabed Authority \(ISA\) on appropriate social discount rates. This was to inform decisions on a financial model for the system of payments of deep seabed mining contracts to the ISA. **R4**, **R5** and **S2** contributed heavily to the analysis. ISA, an autonomous organisation established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, views the report as a key input to its policy decision\-making **\[S10\]**. 

 Freeman continues to be consulted by national and international government bodies on the basis of his Loughborough research. Instances during 2020 include an invitation to participate in a review of environmental discounting by HM Treasury; a commissioned think piece \(with Groom\) for the UK Department for Transport; and a request from the US Environmental Protection Agency for advice on estimating the social cost of carbon.

Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The rural economy in Scotland contributes 27% of Scotland’s overall economy and is dependent on its unique ecosystem. University of Stirling research has resulted in changes to Scottish Government policy, business practices, and land\-owner behaviour that all drive environmental and economic sustainability in Scotland. Specifically: 

 **Impact 1**. Hare management practices have changed on grouse moors due to the Scottish Government providing more protection for Mountain Hares. 

 **Impact 2.** Changes to a business model have allowed increased sustainability and economic success of a seafood delivery SME. 

 **Impact 3.** Scottish Government policy on the prevention of commercial trapping of the invasive Signal Crayfish has been influenced, preventing the uncontrollable spread of this species and consequent environmental damage. 

 These three impacts all promote environmental sustainability, with direct and indirect economic benefits in Scotland. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 This case study utilises our body of research applying data science and mathematical modelling to a range of practical applications, which all have the underlying purpose of driving rural economic and environmental sustainability. For Impacts 1 and 3 the underpinning computational model was a compartmental model \(where, for example grouse are classified as either susceptible or infected\) consisting of coupled non\-linear differential equations that describe the change in the population density in each compartment over time. These models were analysed using a combination of algebraic analysis and numerical simulations. In Impacts 1 and 3, where data is limited, parameter space was explored to determine the optimal values to solve the problem being addressed. Impact 2 was more data driven and involved the development of a bespoke algorithm which, given several different inputs, determined a solution that satisfied a range of complex criteria. 

 Impact 1 is dependent on our research \( **P1** & **P2**\) on Louping Ill virus, which manifests as a disease that primarily affects sheep and grouse in Scotland. Both of these species are economically important. The ticks which transmit the pathogen feed on a wide range of hosts and their population is maintained by deer, mountain hares and sheep. However, they will also feed on grouse. We formulated a contextually unique series of models which determined the relative importance of the roles that these different hosts play in disease transmission. This theoretical work was then verified using data from a large\-scale experiment \( **P1**\). This showed that on some sites, if you remove Mountain Hares, the pathogen is reduced in ticks, and the grouse population recovers. However, in \( **P2\)** we demonstrated that this only applies to sites without the presence of deer. When deer are present, hare culling is no longer effective as a control method. 

 Impact 2 involved our development of a bespoke algorithm that used similar parameter search techniques to the work in impacts 1 and 3.  This work enabled a subscription\-based seafood home delivery company to meet the orders of its expanding customer base while minimising food waste, and ensuring the contents are responsibly and sustainably sourced. Effectively a ‘bin packing’ and parameter search problem \( **P3**\), the company relied on human decisions to fill the boxes of its customers with over 80 different products, with the added difficulty of 3 levels of preference, 3 sizes of box, varied number and portion sizes, and a highly variable supply based on the freshly landed catch at port. We developed a multi criteria, stochastically seeded, algorithm that created an automated shopping list, which satisfied customer preferences with the available produce and enabled orders to be filled more quickly. This was work delivered through funding from Interface. 

 Using the same modelling, analysis and simulation techniques as were used in Impact 1 \( **P2**\), our research that underpinned Impact 3 used a different and novel model to describe the population dynamics of a non\-native invasive species, the Signal Crayfish. The Signal Crayfish was introduced to England for commercial purposes in the 1970s and has since decimated native crayfish species, causing considerable damage to sites of natural heritage and in excess of GBP2,600,000 per annum in damage to local economies. The model was used to determine the impact of different control strategies in a report for DEFRA \( **P4**\), highlighting the potential risks of allowing commercial trapping.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impacts in this case study exemplify our commitment to research that promotes rural sustainability, both economic and environmental. 

 **Impact 1. Protecting the Mountain Hare and Improving Grouse Moor Management** 

 Mountain Hares are native to, and found widely across, upland Scotland, particularly on grouse moors, and are listed on the Scottish Biodiversity List. In 2019 the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee found UK Mountain Hares to be of “unfavourable\-inadequate” conservation status \( **S1**, p.7\). 

 Figure 1. Mountain Hare protection process 

Our models have **impacted the joint official positions** of The Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust \(GWCT\), Scottish National Heritage \(SNH\), and Scottish Land and Estates \(SLE\), representing both sides of the highly charged grouse moor management debate, in 2014. All these organisations now recommend **against** **hare culling** for disease control \( **S2**\), in accordance with our research. 





 A petition was put to the Scottish Government in June 2017 by Onekind for greater protection of mountain hares \( **S3**\). This resulted in the creation of the Grouse Moor Review Group who produced the ‘Werritty report’. The findings of our research **underpinned key points on Mountain Hare management made in this official Scottish Government report** by Professor Werritty \( **S1**, published Dec 2019\) \(see Figure 1 for process\). In his letter of support Professor Werritty says our research “ *was a key contribution underpinning the Group’s recommendation that “the shooting of Mountain Hares should be subject to increased legal regulation”*” \( **S4**\). 

 On 17th June 2020, in the debate on the Animals & Wildlife Bill, the Scottish Parliament cited the Werritty report as part of the evidence and voted to **move Mountain Hares onto the protected species list**, which represents an official commitment to the licensing of all Mountain Hare killing \(link to legislation:  [stir.ac.uk/47r](http://stir.ac.uk/47r)\). As Prof. Werritty confirms, Stirling research “ *played a significant part in the recommendations made by the Scottish Government’s Grouse Moor Management Group and subsequent new legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament*” \( **S4**\). 

 Our impact on Mountain Hare protection is **supporting the development of a healthy Mountain Hare population**. This directly contributes to **environmental protection and sustainability in Scotland** as the Mountain Hare is an indigenous Highland species and is a key prey species for foxes, stoats, the endangered Scottish Wildcat, buzzards, and eagles. 

 The conservation of Scotland’s mountain hare is widely recognised as a priority \( **S3**\). They are: 

1.  Listed on Annex V of the EU Habitats Directive \(1992\) requiring EU member states to maintain them in favourable conservation status. 

1.  A priority species for conservation action under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. 

1.  On the Scottish Biodiversity List, which means that they are considered by Scottish Ministers to be of principal importance for biodiversity conservation. 

1.  Protected by a closed season under the Wildlife and Natural Environment \(Scotland\) Act 2011, which makes it an offence to kill a Mountain Hare in the closed season \(1 March to 31 July\). 

 **Impact 2. Benefitting the environmental and economic sustainability of a Scottish SME** 

 The Stirling\-developed algorithm was intended to reduce waste and improve sustainability through the optimal use of landed catch, and to allow the company to scale up its operations to accommodate its expanding customer base. Our modelling convinced the company that “ *our current model was too complex to scale up according to our ambitions and, as a consequence, prompted us to design and implement a different business model for Fishbox*”. This resulted in a **streamlining of the business processes in order to achieve greater efficiency whilst  continuing to uphold their commitment to**  [**responsible sourcing**](https://www.fishbox.co.uk/blog/our-commitment-to-responsible-sourcing/). The company state that “ *the work that we did with the University of Stirling helped us gain recognition as a nationally renowned and award\-winning company, dedicated to high quality, zero\-waste, sustainable food production*” \( **S5**\). 

 **Measure of impact:** Customer numbers grew from 500 prior in the beginning of the project in 2014, to 1800 in 2018, which could not have occurred without significant change to the business model based on our research \( **S5**\). The impact of Stirling work with Fishbox was also recognised as part of the  [Queen’s Anniversary prize awarded to the University of Stirling in 2020](https://www.stir.ac.uk/news/2020/february/royal-honour-for-the-university-of-stirling/) \( **S6c**\). 

 **Pathway to impact:** The algorithm was based on a body of work from the department \(e.g. **P3**\) but was commercially sensitive and written specifically for this project and hence the link from the research to the impact is direct. An added value of this project is the consequent increased profile of the company. **Fishbox has used the algorithm to generate significant publicity “** *While we were collaborating on the project we won a number of awards and received considerable media coverage; some of which was because of the novelty of the algorithm”*. This occurred through social media and through a workshop held by Scottish Funding Council\-backed Interface in 2016. Following this, in 2016 they entered and won both the Guardian’s “Start Up of the Year” and “Digital Innovation Challenge” \(S6\) referencing our algorithm in their applications. They have also featured in a blog from Interface, along with articles in the Business Quarter magazine and the Guardian. All of these articles explicitly discuss the collaboration with Stirling \( **S6a** & **S6b**\). 

 **Impact 3. Protecting Scottish rivers from non\-native Crayfish** 

 Figure 2. The Signal Crayfish 



Native to North America, the invasive Signal Crayfish \( *Pacifastacus leniusculus*\) \(Figure 2\) was brought to the UK in the 1970s for farming; its spread to rivers \(in England and Wales, and after 1995 in Scotland\) has caused the widespread elimination of whole populations of the native White\-clawed Crayfish \( *Austropotamobius pallipes*\) \(which is listed on Annex II of the Habitats Directive\) through predation, competition and transmission of crayfish plague. In running water, extensive burrowing by Signal Crayfish destabilises banks, causing erosion, and bank collapse. Signal Crayfish further predate juvenile fish, reducing native salmon and trout populations. In 2015 Signal Crayfish occupied approximately 87 km<sup>2</sup> of freshwater in Scotland, with an annual cost to the Scottish angling industry of GBP325,000 \( **S7**\). 

 In 2016 the Scottish Government responded to a petition \( **S8**\) calling on parliament to amend the existing licensing regime to allow for the commercial trapping of American Signal Crayfish in Scotland \(it is commercially trapped in England\). The Government used our modelling \( **P4**\) to underpin its conclusion “that allowing the commercial trapping of these American signal crayfish, even as a control measure, would lead to expansion of its range”. Therefore, the petition was rejected and commercial trapping of Signal Crayfish remains banned in Scotland.

 **Measure of impact:** Our work has led to the prevention of further spread of the invasive crayfish, preserved native species, and prevented environmental damage. It has thus played a role in protecting the GBP126,000,000 angling industry in Scotland. The estimated cost of the invasive crayfish to the British economy is approximately GBP2,700,000 million per year \(source:  [http://stir.ac.uk/4s0](http://stir.ac.uk/4s0)\), thus indicating the likely savings that have been made in Scotland. 

 **Pathway to impact:** DEFRA commissioned a report on Invasive Crayfish in Great Britain \( **P4**\) which was published in 2012, it contained our mathematical model which explored a range of different control methods including trapping. In February 2015, the petition described above \(PE1558 I\) was lodged \( **S8**\). The Public Petitions Committee called for a briefing from SNH and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency \(SEPA\), as well as an evidence review by SPICe \(Scottish Parliament Information Centre\) to inform its decision. The SNH/SEPA statement does not directly cite its evidence, however it makes clear reference to our DEFRA report \(P4\) by saying: “A recent review of signal crayfish invasions in the UK concluded that although trapping can reduce the abundance of trappable animals, it does not necessarily reduce their total number or the biomass” \( **S7**, p.2, para.10\); **P4** was the only recent UK review, meaning this can only refer to our research. The SPICe review \( **S9**\) identifies only seven pieces of research of relevance \(none of which supported the petition\), of which our DEFRA report \( **P4**\) is one. The Public Petitions Committee particularly cited the SPICe review as influential in swaying its opinion to reject the petition \( **S10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Resulting mainly from transport accidents, falls, assaults and sports\-related injuries, traumatic brain injury \(TBI\) comprises a complex range of brain damage. Outcomes differ greatly between patients, and with the full heterogenous range of head injuries, it has been extremely difficult to improve outcomes by linking particular characteristics to optimum treatments. Multidisciplinary Cambridge University research has developed new therapies and combined novel monitoring and advanced imaging tools to guide patient care. The discoveries have also resulted in changes to clinical guidelines, routine practice, clinical training and public understanding of TBI. Ultimately, they have improved the management and health outcomes of patients with TBI, worldwide. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As the most common cause of death under the age of 40 in high\-income countries, TBI causes a million deaths each year globally \[1\]. The outcome from TBI is highly variable, but approximately 50% of patients who are admitted to an Intensive Care Unit \(ICU\) with TBI do not survive or are left severely disabled \[1\]. 

 TBI combines the primary injury of the initial impact with secondary injuries including hypoxia \(tissue oxygen deprivation\) and hypotension \(low blood pressure\). The brain swells within the tight confines of the skull leading to a hitherto poorly\-understood vicious cycle of raised intracranial pressure, reduced cerebral blood flow, compromised cerebral oxygenation, energy failure, cell death and further swelling. The interventions used to manage these physiological insults include hazardous medical therapies \(induced coma\) and operative interventions.  The complexity of TBI has meant that it is difficult to determine the benefits of these treatments in populations of patients, or balance their risk and benefits in individual patients. 

  

 University of Cambridge researchers have led international, multidisciplinary efforts to characterise these problems and identify global strategies to address them. Under the leadership of Hutchinson and Menon, the researchers have developed innovative therapies \[2\-4\] and identified novel monitoring tools \[5\-6\]; all of which target the management of intracranial pressure, thus breaking the vicious cycle of brain swelling. Significantly, in 2017 Hutchinson and Menon established the NIHR Global Health Research Group on Neurotrauma which brings together researchers from 11 low and middle income countries \(LMICs\) and three high\-income countries to improve the management and outcome of TBI in resource\-limited settings \[2, 4\], in addition to a large study of outcome in over 50 countries. 

 **New therapies: decompressive craniectomy** 

 Cambridge University researchers have led international studies to assess novel treatments for TBI, and specifically, decompressive craniectomy \(removal of a section of the skull to reduce intracranial pressure\) \[2\]. Between 2004 and 2014 they led the **RESCUEicp** trial, involving 408 patients from 50 countries, to establish a robust evidence base on which to evaluate patient outcomes \[3\]. The trial determined the success of decompressive craniectomy when medical management measures had failed to control intracranial pressure. Decompressive craniectomy was shown to reduce mortality when compared against standard medical treatment, with a spectrum of outcome in the survivors and an improvement in outcome between six months and 12 months. 

 **New therapies: development of 3D titanium plates for skull reconstruction** 

 Decompressive craniectomy requires subsequent repair with either the patient’s bone or a synthetic plate. As hosts of the NIHR Medtech Brain Injury Co\-operative, Hutchinson and the Cambridge team have continued to develop new technologies via collaboration with other academic institutions, industry, patients and the public. Through these collaborations, the team pioneered the development of individually\-tailored 3D\-printed titanium plates for skull reconstruction, and designed special software that uses CT data of the patient’s skull to ensure a precise fit. The plates are made from 3D virtual models using an additive manufacturing \(3D printing\) process called laser sintering, then finished to a smooth texture. The team has obtained preliminary data showing that skull reconstruction can be performed safely within three months of the initial decompressive craniectomy surgery \[4\]. The technology offers the benefit of being lower cost, reduced operating time, a good aesthetic result, and good biocompatibility, especially for complex craniofacial reconstruction. 

 **Novel monitoring tools: biochemical monitoring and advanced imaging** 

 In parallel with the development of innovative therapies, the researchers have established protocols which integrate and display advanced monitoring technologies to predict outcomes and deliver individualised treatments. In 2004, the team launched intensive care monitoring software, ICM\+. Since its launch, the researchers have continued to develop new applications for more precise monitoring of intracranial pressure and cerebrovascular reactivity \(the change in cerebral blood flow in response to therapeutics designed to increase or decrease blood pressure and heart rate\) \[5\]. In a study of 601 adult TBI patients, the combination of these dynamic monitoring variables and their time profile improved prediction of outcome \[5\]. These studies have been underpinned by data from high\-field magnetic resonance imaging \(MRI\) and positron emission tomography \(PET\), \[6\] which have informed clinical protocol development. 

 The team has also pioneered cerebral microdialysis \(continuous sampling of the brain’s extracellular fluid for analysis of brain tissue biochemistry\) to monitor cerebral metabolism and inflammation in real\-time \[7\]. In a study of 223 adult TBI patients, the researchers demonstrated that extracellular metabolic biomarkers are independently associated with outcome following traumatic brain injury \[7\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact on management and outcomes of patients with TBI worldwide** 

 Hutchinson and Menon have led and participated in a number of collaborations, which have contributed to reducing the likelihood of dying from brain injury in the UK \[A\]. Specifically, decompressive craniectomy\[3\]  is now used routinely in the UK and has saved 22 additional lives out of 100, with 60% of survivors independent at home \[A\].  The President of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies explained that “ *decompressive craniectomy \[which\] is routinely performed and listed as a treatment in the guidelines \[…\] leads to a marked reduction in mortality \(from 52\-30% at 12 months\) and categorised the outcome in survivors \(43% upper severe disability or better, 30% lower severe disability or worse\)”* \[B\]. 

 Through collaboration with colleagues and partners in LMICs, Cambridge University research has also improved TBI management in resource\-limited settings. Professor of Neurosurgery at the University of Cape Town and past\-President of the International Neurotrauma Society, stated that the NIHR Global Research Group “ *has stood out as the one \[neuro\-trauma initiative\] with the greatest impact across the widest economic and geographic range.”* Furthermore, he noted that Cambridge research is “ *helping us raise the profile of traumatic brain injury in Africa and implement policy change”* through collaborations on a number of research studies related to improving TBI management and outcome and through establishing global registries \[C\]. 

 **Impact on clinical guidelines** 

 Cambridge research findings have contributed to new protocols for the management of patients in neuro\-intensive care, especially the management of raised intracranial pressure. These have included multinational consensus statements and international guidelines as follows: 

-  Facilitated by the NIHR Global Health Research Group, Hutchinson led the 2019 ‘ *Consensus statement from the International Consensus Meeting on the Role of Decompressive Craniectomy in the Management of Traumatic Brain Injury’* \[D\]. The Consensus Statement settled debate among the clinical and research communities through providing general guidance on decompressive craniectomy. 

-  Hutchinson led the 2015 ‘ *Consensus statement from the 2014 International Microdialysis Forum’* \[D\], which paved the way for improved neurocritical care protocols for patients with raised intracranial pressure and for further individualised patient therapies \[6\]. 

-  Menon co\-chaired and Hutchinson contributed to the 2017 *Lancet Neurology Commission on Traumatic Brain Injury* \[D\] which has informed EU policy and research funding decisions on the basis of Cambridge\-led research. 

-  Menon co\-chaired and Hutchinson contributed to the 2014 US Neurocritical Care Society and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine ‘ *Consensus summary statement of the International Multidisciplinary Consensus Conference on Multimodality Monitoring in Neurocritical Care’* \[D\]. This Consensus Statement provides healthcare professionals with best practice for monitoring patients with TBI. 

-  In 2020, following the publication of RESCUEicp, the US Brain Trauma Foundation amended its guideline, *Decompressive craniectomy is suggested to treat neurologic deterioration, herniation, or intracranial hypertension refractory to medical management’* \[D\] which included changes to its recommendations on intracranial pressure thresholds based on Cambridge University research. 

 Given their significant expertise and scientific leadership, the Cambridge University team has also contributed to key national and international guideline developments: 

-  Hutchinson and Menon were members of the 2014 NICE Guideline Development Group for Head Injury, with the respective specialities as neurosurgeon and neurointensivist \[E\]. 

-  The Cambridge research team produced the 2019 *Intensive Care in Myanmar* report \[E\] which provides a series of recommendations and helps design and deliver courses training physicians and nurses to improve trauma patient care in the country. 

 **Impact on clinical practice** 

 Decompressive craniectomy is now a routine clinical procedure, improving outcomes for patients worldwide \[B\]. Additionally, Cambridge University’s pioneering research into the development of 3D\-printed titanium cranioplasty plates \[4\] emphasised the need for the routine collection of high\-quality data about cranioplasties undertaken across the UK to improve outcomes for patients. Consequently in 2014 the researchers launched the UK Cranial Reconstruction Registry \(UKCRR\) \[F\]. Partly inspired by the UKCRR, the German Cranial Reconstruction Registry \(GCRR\) was established in 2015, providing further data to improve patient outcomes \[F\]. 

 The UKCRR is hosted on the Outcome Registry Intervention and Operation Network \(ORION\) platform to document referral processes. The ORION web application, developed and hosted by the research team at Cambridge since 2012, enables secure submission, retrieval and sharing of healthcare information across multiple sites. It has been adopted by other neuroscience units in the UK and by 2015 over 30,000 patients had been captured by ORION \[F\]. 

 ICM\+ software provides clinicians with real\-time multimodality monitoring, analysis and data storage. A neurointensivist at Maastricht University and Editor of Neurocritical Care has described the clinical utility of ICM\+ as follows: *“the ICM\+ platform, perhaps uniquely, provides metrics that better enable us to match treatments to patients, allowing us to use precision medicine approaches in clinical ICU care following traumatic brain injury”* \[G\].  Since 2014, 129 ICM\+ licences have been issued to centres across Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Australia and New Zealand, facilitating improved management and treatment of TBI around the globe \[G\].  User group interviews have provided insight on how ICM\+ can support clinical decision\-making: *“ICM\+ helps me to understand what has happened to patients over a long period of time. For example, if intracranial pressure has increased, clinicians can use ICM\+ to understand how cerebral autoregulation has changed.”* \[G\]. 

 **Impact on improvement training for healthcare professionals** 

 Cambridge\-led innovations have had a significant impact on training speciality clinicians. In addition to its clinical utility, the ICM\+ software is a useful teaching tool. From the user group: *“ICM\+ can help me to articulate and show my students how the patients’ physiological conditions have changed over a long period of time using the visualisation function.”* \[G\]. 

 The Cambridge University research team is also dedicated to training healthcare professionals across the globe to ensure that there is sufficient clinical capacity and expertise in TBI. The NIHR Global Health Research Group on Neurotrauma has facilitated improvements in TBI care across a number of LMICs. For example, the Group established the University of Cambridge – Lusaka, Zambia Twinning Programme in 2017 as part of a teaching, capacity building and research endeavour.  Since its establishment, the initiative has improved local ICU care through a programme of training courses for physicians and nurses \[H\]. In Myanmar, the Group has facilitated the development of a Yangon city\-wide trauma network and accompanying training programme \[E\]. 

 **Impact on public policy, awareness and understanding** 

 Through engaging with policy\-makers and the public, the research team has contributed to public understanding of TBI and its prevention. Menon was Executive Editor of and Hutchinson was a contributor to the *Time for Change* report produced by the UK All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Acquired Brain Injury \(ABI; brain injury from any cause after birth\) to which TBI is a major contributor \[I\]. 

 As an expert in head injury, Hutchinson collaborated with the Sport and Recreation Alliance to develop and endorse its 2015 *Concussion Guidelines for the Education Sector*, which set out how to recognise concussion, how to respond to it and how to ensure the individual returns safely to their education and sport. \[J\]; these Guidelines have been adopted by the English Rugby Football Union \(Hutchinson is also a member of its Concussion Panel\) for all those taking part in the sport in schools and colleges \[J\]. The President of the Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine states: *“We are now delighted to see the launch of concussion guidelines to help teachers, school staff, coaches, parents and carers to be aware of the danger signs and how a suspected concussion should be managed in the absence of a trained medical professional”* \[J\]. 

 **Impact on commerce and the economy** 

 ICM\+ software was commercialised by Cambridge Enterprise in 2011 and since 2014, 129 licenses have been sold \[text removed for publication\] \[G\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Aston research has led to five key impacts: 

-  Development of a new business model to enable communities to shift from straw burning to straw pellet production. 

-  Formation of a new business in India – award\-winning A2P\- that has a commercial demonstrator, contracts to process rice straw, and partnerships with Larsen and Toubro \(L&T\), IKEA, Pepsi, Jawandsons and WWF. 

-  Reduction of carbon footprint and associated pollution.  Since 2017, 700\-2000 tons/year of rice straw, across 300\-1000 acres and 40\-100 farms, were turned into rice pellets not burned. 

-  Demonstrated crop yields increase of 7\-15% through bio\-char application, leading to growing interest from farming communities and reducing commercial fertiliser reliance. 

-  Raised awareness and engagement in government, business and communities.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 This impact built on the following research: 

####  Identification of pyrolysis as key approach to gain value from waste agricultural material 

 Bridgwater pioneered bioenergy at Aston, researching thermochemical conversion of biomass and developing chemical engineering processes for generating chemicals, fuels and energy \[ **R1**\]. Pyrolysis reactors were designed and built for different biomass feedstocks. 

####  Development of enhanced technology for high value extraction 

 Specific crops were assessed for the quality of bio\-oil produced, including commercially important stability and yield \[e.g. **R2**\]. Using agricultural land for food and energy crop production can cause conflict, so various high\-volume agricultural wastes and residues were evaluated including from paper mills, breweries and sewage works gaining substantial experience in processing a wide range of waste. 

####  Application of Pyroformer™ 

 Aston patented \[ **R3**\] an intermediate pyrolysis reactor where condensed vapours produce pyrolysis oil that, when blended with biodiesel, drives liquid\-fuelled combined heat and power engines. Pyroformer™ won Best Technological Breakthrough at the 2013 National Climate Week Awards. 

 India was a potential volume user for this technology. It produces large amounts of waste rice straw, traditionally burnt to create a significant carbon footprint and associated pollution \[ **S6**\]. Joint research projects with IIT ROPAR \(IITR\), Punjab Agricultural University \(PAU\), and the Institute of Petroleum \(IIP\) made a solution viable. \[ **G1**\]. 

 With IITR, a Pyroformer™ was installed in a community to understand the economic and environmental drivers that would enable adoption. Paddy straw was pelletised and processed to produce biochar and vapour. Condensable vapour was blended with diesel; non\-condensable vapour fed a dual fuel engine and powered a school \[ **S1**\]. 

 Project workstream \(1\) focused on pellet production as a viable business model \[ **R4**\]; workstream \(2\) established a pyrolysis system at PAU for studies of bio\-char \[ **R5**\]; workstream \(3\) moved to IIP to explore improved liquid products \(or applications of existing products\), this ongoing work is now replicating PAU’s installation in Orissa state, with government support. 

####  In\-country supply chain analysis 

 A financially sustainable supply chain was required that removed straw and delivered value to farmers. Techno\-economic evaluations demonstrated the locations and scale where bioenergy generation has greatest potential by minimising costs and maximising performance. Initial studies \[ **R2**\] have been followed by detailed analyses \[e.g. R4&R6, Science Bridge project\] providing information that is vital to stakeholders. 

 Challenges include: timing \(21 days from rice harvest to wheat sowing\); the availability of equipment \(straw harvesting requires special equipment and know\-how\); proximity \(raw materials shouldn’t be transported far\); and storage \(straw is collected in a 6\-8 week period, and must then be processed\). Pellets are a natural intermediate product: dense, low water content, transportable and feed the downstream pyrolysis processes \[ **S1**\]. 

 For pyrolysis, the techno\-economic research shows that vapours produced alongside the biochar are better burnt immediately on\-site rather than condensing into oil. The plant at PAU utilised this result \[ **S1**\]. 

 It was also recognised that producing pellets from rice straw and using them directly as fuel is beneficial, with local pellet production addressing a number of the key challenges above. Identifying a number of local boiler operators, most consuming biomass shipped from hundreds of kilometres away, also highlighted an opportunity \[ **S1**\]. 

####  Demonstration of increased crop yields 

 Joint research with PAU, funded by Coromandel \(fertiliser division of India’s multinational Murugappa Group\), showed an increase in potato, onion and maize crop yield treated with biochar. A new reactor version was also developed that produces biochar but also directly burns resulting vapour to produce hot water. This is fed into a Vapour Absorption Machine \(VAM\) to produce cold air, which the demonstrator uses to chill a food storage unit.  \[ **S5,R5**\]

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Each village in the Punjab produces \~1\-2,000 tonnes of waste rice straw which must be cleared from fields within 21 days of harvest to plant wheat crops. It is often burnt while damp in open fields, using kerosene, creating a large carbon footprint and significant pollution. 20 million tonnes of rice straw is burnt annually in the Punjab alone. 

 In 2016, Aston and the Oglesby Charitable Trust created an Indian charitable trust, Energy Harvest Trust \(EHT\) to address this issue leading to five key impacts. 

####  1. Development of a new business model in India to prevent open field burning \(reducing pollution and carbon emissions\), create viable supply chains and benefit communities 

 This required establishing infrastructure for engaging with farmers: harvesting and collecting straw; manufacturing, handling, and storing pellets; and identifying customers for using the pellets as fuel. This supply chain did not exist in the Punjab prior to establishing A2P Energy Solution \(A2P\) in 2018 \(Impact 2\) \[ **S1**\]. A key challenge was understanding how it would be used within communities \- it needed to be local, reliable, energy efficient and economically viable \[ **R2**\]. 

 In 2017, EHT worked with Nabha Power Ltd \(NPL\) \(a division of L&T\) to engage with villagers. A local entrepreneur hosted the plant, and other entrepreneurs began collecting paddy straw. Pellets were manufactured and sold to a local Pepsi plant, fuelling the boiler employed in crisp manufacture. \[ **S1,S2**\] 

 In 2018, the plant was expanded by A2P, and a new partnership established with Jawandsons, a major textile contributor to IKEA’s supply chain, now using paddy straw pellets as boiler fuel for steam production. The WWF is monitoring this project, working with IKEA to move it towards a more sustainable energy supply chain, and to replicate the model elsewhere. \[ **S1,S3,S4**\] 

####  2. Formation of a new business in India 

 A2P was formed by Berry and Singh in Chandigarh, India. Building on \[ **R2,R4,R6**\], A2P has: a pyrolysis product made by local manufacturers \(cost £20,000\), a working business model, and several customers. 

 The first system was installed in partnership with NPL which had a power plant in the area and was working with 49 villages to provide infrastructure \[ **S2**\]. A2P has focussed on improving efficiencies of this pellet plant at Nabha which can now process 10\-12 tons/day and mixes 70% rice straw and 30% sawdust to increase calorific value which can then be burnt in a controlled way to produce power. In 2020 business growth allowed A2P to employ 12 people directly in pellet manufacture, and 34 people seasonally \(for collection/baling\). \[ **S1**\] 

####  3. Reduced carbon footprint and pollution 

 A2P has issued contracts for the collection of 600\-2,000 tons/year of rice straw to be turned into rice pellets by their first commercial demonstrator. The facility is with local manufacturers and is currently producing 5\-10 tons pellets/day. Pellets reduce straw to 40% of the original volume, making it easier to store and transport, and are used for fuel and potentially animal food. 

 Burnt in the open field, 1 ton of paddy straw releases 3kg particulate matter, 60kg CO, 1,460kg CO2, 199kg ash, and 2kg SO2. In pellet form, straw has a lower moisture content, <5% versus 30% lying in the field. So, burning pellets substantially reduces CO/CO2 emissions, and since commercial boilers in India are mandated to regulate emissions, the 3kg/ton particulate matter is also eliminated directly. The locally produced pellets reduce reliance on transported fuel \- Jawandsons now uses \~3 tons/day of pellets instead of groundnut shells transported hundreds of kilometres. \[ **S1,S4**\] 

####  4. Increased crop yields 

 A second pellet and pyrolysis demonstrate was installed at PAU. This creates biochar, which can be used as a soil additive, and the resulting pyrolysis vapours are burnt directly at source and used to heat water which in turn can be used for refrigeration. 

 Joint field trials with PAU and Coromandel \(2016\-2019\) showed a 7\-15% increase in potato and onion crop yields when biochar is applied. Coromandel has now funded more work \(2019\-2021\) to enable farmer\-field trials and test paddy\-straw biochar as a commercial product. They are also funding A2P for the development of a commercial grade biochar reactor. \[ **S1,S5**\] 

####  5. Raising government and community awareness 

 There had been government resistance to ex\-situ solutions, but state and national government agencies now seek advice from A2P on new projects, and the government has initiated a number of its own that build on A2P’s supply chain establishment and technical approach. \[ **S1**\] 

 Working with the IKEA supplier has also impacted IKEA’s sustainability strategy. Initially focused solely on the use of local and renewable materials in manufacturing, A2P’s work with paddy straw has influenced IKEA’s direction to include the energy used in production. 

 WWF also has an initiative to address the paddy straw burning problem, and A2P is assisting with this work to expand their suite of best\-practices, and to influence the wider community of textile manufacturers.  A new CSR initiative has been established to fund straw collection equipment for farmer entrepreneurs.  With a single upfront donation of about £70k the equipment can be purchased to enable 1200 acres/season of straw to be collected.  This straw produces a sustainable income of £35k/year for 5\-6 years, and results in large reductions in annual emissions \(\~3.5 Mtons/yr CO2, 7.2 tons/yr particulates\). Additionally, >50% of operating costs is invested directly back into the community via employment and services \(straw collection\).  WWF has committed to co\-brand this initiative in India, as well as support it through donation. \[ **S4,S1**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Durham University’s research in marketing and management has enhanced supply chain management \(SCM\) by several UK firms. The impact on these particular firms is important as they comprise a variety of actors including larger firms and SMEs in the manufacturing sector; and thus the benefits they accrue will have further impact on suppliers and customers in their respective supply chains. The impact involves facilitating significant changes in practice to: \(i\) radically improve processes of analysing the marketplace and customer relationships; \(ii\) develop new work practices for managing these relationships, reflecting an improved marketing orientation; \(iii\) improve manufacturing firms’ effectiveness in providing customer value; and \(iv\) develop and implement more responsive operational processes. As a result of the research, organisations have been able to more systematically engage with their supply chain partners and hence improve their performance. The impact has spread from original studies of manufacturing excellence across several organisations to funded projects including a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) and an ESRC impact acceleration award, thereby combining what was initially a broad level of engagement with more highly focused outcomes. Specific improvements include: better generation of ideas for new product development \(NPD\); greater effectiveness of shared processes across the supply chain; identifying and mobilising partners to contribute value to customer solutions; and the development of a data classification policy which facilitates different supply chain configurations. The impact resulted in significant performance improvements, e.g. for one company, PSP Architectural, turnover increased by approximately 28% and staff headcount by 50% over 2 years.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research that underpins this case study falls into the closely linked areas of supply chain integration and business\-to\-business \(B2B\) marketing. The former refers to the degree to which a manufacturer strategically collaborates with its supply chain partners and jointly manages intra\- and inter\-organization processes; the latter refers to the management of market\-based relationships between organizations, including buying and selling. The research explores how integrating such processes for developing new offerings and planning production can improve organisational performance. 

 During the current REF period, Ellis and Tsinopoulos led a programme of engagement activities which generated impact, through improved business performance, and new research, through the generation of data and business driven research questions. Both the impact and the research focus on the customer and supplier sides of integration, and on the balancing of a strong internal focus \(e.g. on manufacturing processes – R1, R2\) with external awareness \(e.g. the wider industrial network in which inter\-firm relations are embedded \- R4\). The research which underpins the impact falls under three streams. 

 In the **first stream**, the research has compared the integration practices of lead users \(customers with specific needs and innovative skills\) with those of suppliers. Findings indicate that integration with the former is superior to the latter \(e.g. R1 & R3\) and has therefore guided choices on the direction of integration. The **second stream** has examined the underlying dimensions of supply chain integration. It has argued that different combinations of product newness and process structure will determine how a manufacturing organisation will benefit from integrating with customers and suppliers \(R2 & R6\). These two streams are novel due to their combination of the study of supply chain integration practices with those internal to the firm. This has facilitated the explanation of influences on, and barriers to, integration in greater depth than hitherto, including the significance of product newness. Finally, the **third stream** has explored how marketing and purchasing managers in different B2B contexts socially construct boundaries as well as notions of value; and the implications of these constructions for the management of inter\-firm relations \(R4 & R5\). This stream is novel as such relationships have largely been studied from a quantitative perspective rather than this more nuanced interpretive approach. 

 The specific research findings that have led to impact are as follows: 

-  Integration of NPD and production processes between suppliers and customers is multidimensional \(R3, R6\). 

-  The integration of procedures and decision making for NPD and processes that can add value will depend on \(i\) the newness and familiarity of the products and processes \(R6\); and \(ii\) the type of process structure used by the focal organisation \(R1, R2 & R6\). 

-  Managers’ inter\-personal behaviours can help the development of inter\-organizational relationships \(R4\). 

-  The efforts of more peripheral actors beyond the core buyer\-supplier relationship can result in network value creation \(R5\). 

-  Firms should seek to balance external and internal perspectives when developing supply chain strategy \(R4 & R5\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Overall, the impact consists of improvements in the performance of several UK manufacturers through more effective management of supply chain relationships for understanding customer needs, developing new products and improving decision making. Reach and significance of the impact was achieved by engaging with two groups of companies. The first \(project 1\), includes a high number of manufacturers that received detailed research\-led guidance on improving their supply chain integration practices. It includes the manufacturers that participated in the Institute of Mechanical Engineers’ \(IMechE\) Manufacturing Excellence \(‘MX’\) awards \(project 1\). The second \(projects 2 and 3\) includes two organisations with whom the research team engaged closely to significantly improve the processes used to manage their supply chain relationships \(PWS Distributors \(2018 GBP63million turnover\) – see E3 & E9; and PSP Architectural \(2018 GBP9million turnover & 100 staff\)\) \(E8\). 

####  **Project 1 \- Reach: MX Benchmarking project** 

 The ‘MX’ award scheme has served as the basis for increasing the reach of the impact by guiding the change of processes and thus improving the business performance of about twenty UK manufacturers per year \(E1\). MX’s aims have been to: i\) recognise the best manufacturing practices in the UK; and, ii\) improve participants’ business performance by providing detailed world leading and research\-led recommendations for process improvement. Prof. Tsinopoulos has been a key member of the award design team \(2000\-11\) and then member of the executive committee \(2011\-16\) of the awards. He was in charge for the provision of feedback \(benchmarking\) to the participating organisations up to 2016. 

 This has been an iterative engagement during which: i\) Tsinopoulos has used the data submitted by organisations to generate research \(R6\); and ii\) the participating organisations used the feedback to improve how they manage their processes. It is here that we have seen ‘ *the positive impact which this programme has had on the UK manufacturing companies who have participated’* \(E1\). 

 The feedback \(benchmarking\) reports, that all manufacturers received, built on the Durham team’s research and explained what they each needed to do to improve their supply chain relationships so as to enhance their business performance \(i.e. R3 & R6\). For instance, when a manufacturer reported weak integration practices, the report would provide detailed guidance on how to improve them, e.g. by classifying suppliers so as to streamline information sharing and improve decision making \(R6\). Such guidance was based on the second stream of work. Similarly, when a manufacturer reported weaknesses in the generation of ideas, for NPD, the report would provide detailed guidance on how to engage with suppliers and/or lead users to develop product solutions which are technically feasible and marketable. Such guidance was based on the first stream of work. 

 Manufacturers have used this research\-led guidance to improve the integration with their suppliers on the most appropriate dimensions \(E1\). For example, <ins>ZF Lemforder Ltd</ins> \(2018 turnover: USD296million \(12\-2018, E2\)\), who improved their competitiveness by achieving *‘standardisation between our assembly lines, departments and processes’,* both internally and externally \(E4\). These improved practices *have had ‘a direct influence on our quality, cost and delivery’* \(E4\). Since 2017, ZF have worked with a key customer organisation to *‘design the assembly for ease of manufacturer and reduce the risk of mis\-builds*’ \(E4\). Similarly, <ins>AGFA Graphics</ins>, who participated multiple times, \(2018 turnover: USD89million \(12\-2018, E2\)\) have provided clear indications of where the feedback has been used to reduce ‘ *cost and quality risks*’ from holding ‘ *excess material*’ between sites \(E5\). This includes the development of process improvements across the supply chain which led to the survival of a plant: ‘ *without MX participation, the Leeds factory would probably have been closed down’* \(E5\). 

####  **Project 2 \- Significance: KTP with PSP Architectural on the development of closer integration with customers and suppliers** 

 During this Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\), PSP, a Shildon\-based manufacturer of rain\-screen systems and metal fabrications, was provided with ‘ *the knowledge and expertise that PSP lacks*’ \(E6\) to integrate its marketing and supply chain and improve how managers make decisions. 

 The company worked with Profs Ellis and Tsinopoulos to significantly change its processes to better configure its supply chain partnerships \(R4\). This entailed better appreciating where and how value is created across the supply chain \(E6 & E7\). This understanding was based on findings reported in R2, R4, R5 & R6. As a result, the company has been able to identify better product opportunities in its trading relationships and added\-value services \(R5\). This has promoted a more partnership\-based approach to the management of its supply chain, thereby managing its integration efforts more effectively. Resulting strategies acknowledged the significance of customers, competitors and other stakeholders. Indeed, PSP states that ‘ *the biggest impact was on the structure within the company and how we communicate internally and externally’* \(E8\). 

 Prof Ellis and the KTP Associate conducted extensive qualitative research \(underpinned by the methods in R4 & 5\) into managerial perceptions within the construction industry network \(E7\). Based on these studies, PSP set up and implemented processes and systems for customer acquisition and the subsequent management of relationships with the key network actors that contribute to value creation within the sector. This enhanced approach to managing its B2B relationship portfolio included the appointment of new senior personnel with *‘significant experience with project work and a greater understanding of site construction’.* The company states that this has *‘improved both the communication and project control within the business resulting in orders being received regularly from much larger clients’* \(E8\). PSP has also set up a design operation to add value to customers, thus ensuring that the external identity of ‘solutions’ supplier that it was projecting to the marketplace was mirrored by internal practices. By thereby offering a service that many competitors do not, ‘ *this assists significantly in securing projects’* \(E8\). 

 As a result of using improved knowledge of changing customer needs, the transformation in the company’s network positioning, marketing orientation and supporting operations has manifested itself in an increased level of enquiries from potential clients. This has enabled PSP to select higher margin opportunities from a more comprehensive relationship portfolio; opportunities it was better able to serve thanks to closer relations with suppliers. The impact on the company was extensive: sales have increased such that turnover in the year 2017\-18 was GBP9million, from GBP7million in 2014\-15, and staff headcount increased from 66 to over 100 \(E7 & E8\). 

####  **Project 3 \- Significance: PWS Distributors and ESRC Impact Acceleration Account** 

 PWS in Newton Aycliffe is a supplier of kitchen components and work surfaces. Contrary to PSP above, PWS’s products are relatively high volume and standardised, a configuration which dictates a different way of integrating with customers and suppliers. Facilitated by matched funding from the ESRC’s IAA, Prof Tsinopoulos was able to guide the firm in significantly changing its integration practices and in developing and implementing a strategy for business growth. The project applied the findings of his research on supply chain configurations and customer identification \(R1 & R6\) to develop and implement a methodology of proactive information provision and data analysis for the firm. It encouraged the development of a culture of data\-driven decision making which considered modes of supply chain integration on one hand and the way marketing decisions were made on the other, thereby maximising customer value. As the firm puts it, ‘ *This was achieved by implementing product and customer segmentation within a business intelligence \(BI\) system, as identified by a program of engagement with stakeholders*’ \(E9\). 

 They add, ‘ *The project achieved success in allowing individuals to validate their intuitions as a data\-driven assessment via the BI system’* \(E9\), for example in comparing the cost/benefit of a new carrier’s better delivery rate in relation to warehouse work rate and different packing methods. Service improvements were also noted, for instance *‘by adopting a rigorous customer segmentation approach within the warehousing section, customers can receive a service offering which is appropriate for their customer type and position within the supply chain’* \(E9\). This included alternative delivery methods and the need for goods to be labelled and consigned individually, ‘ *including their end consumers’ preferences*’ \(E9\). Moreover, the effects of service changes are more apparent with the improved processes and systems, so that ‘ *when moving a customer onto a premium service method, the effects upon credits can be seen sharply from that point onwards’* \(E9\). PWS believe that the impacts of implementing research findings were seen amongst stakeholders throughout the supply chain \(as suggested by R2, R4 & R5\), for instance in: *‘helping suppliers to optimise their production’; ‘helping increase customer value by enabling carriers to achieve a reduced damages rate’; ‘helping warehousing to function more efficiently’* by examining failure data; and *‘helping customers to increase the value of their business by reducing their failure rates*’ \(E9\).

A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

#  **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Researchers at Queen Mary produced breakthrough algorithms for detecting computational memory violations. Using these algorithms, they developed the program analysis tool Infer, initially commercialised by the Queen Mary spin\-off Monoidics, and since 2013, when Monoidics was acquired, by Facebook. Infer enables highly\-scalable automatic verification of memory violations, which are a major cause of security breaches and operational flaws in software systems. Infer is open source and used by companies \(including Amazon, Spotify, Uber, Mozilla\) and developers around the world. 

 At Facebook, Infer analyses every change of infrastructure and mobile code. Every month, thousands of bugs are fixed before Facebook’s apps \(ie Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus\) are shipped to its 1,600,000,000 users. In the second half of 2017 alone, more than 25,000 bugs reported by Infer were fixed by Facebook developers saving tens of thousands of hours.

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Verifying that computer programs correctly and safely manipulate computer memory is imperative, as memory errors can cause operational flaws and have fatal consequences for the missions of systems \(eg safety of a plane in flight\). However, previous program verifiers had only been tested in toy programs of tens or hundreds of lines of code. Large systems need a reliable verifier for hundreds of thousands or even millions of lines of code. The program verifier, Infer, enables this level of verification. 

 Infer is based on research on logics for reasoning about memory use and a type of algorithm that gives partial decision procedures. Two areas of research were brought together to develop ‘separation logic,’ the first effective theory for reasoning about computer memory. Pym and O'Hearn at Queen Mary \(both now at UCL\) brought their research on substructural logic together with joint work \(between researchers at Queen Mary and Carnegie Mellon\) on a type of data and data structure – primitives to describe heap structure – to develop the theory of separation logic. Based on these theories, Distefano, at Queen Mary, produced the Space Invader tool \[3.1\], the first program analyser based on separation logic. Space Invader opened up, for the first time, the possibility of automating the theoretical ideas of separation logic. 

 To move on from the Space Invader tool to automatic proofs that can be used in real\-world industrial code, several steps were necessary. The first milestone was reached when Distefano, in collaboration with Calcagno at Imperial College and other researchers at Microsoft, developed a technique where an analyser can tune the precision of its analysis on\-the\-fly to different data structures of the analysed program \[3.2\]. 

 The second milestone was the development of automatic proofs concerning the use of pointers. Pointers are variables whose value is a location in the computer’s memory. They are one of the major sources of error in memory manipulation in entire industrial programs \(Linux and Microsoft device drivers of up to 10,000 lines of code\) \[3.3\]. After this development, Distefano and researchers at Microsoft introduced a fully automated verification approach for object\-oriented languages using separation logic \[3.4\]. 

 Finally, Distefano proposed the notion of bi\-abductive inference \(a form of logical inference that automates the key ideas about local reasoning\), a breakthrough that allowed partial properties of entire open\-source projects in the hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of code to be shown \[3.5\]. To put these results in context, just a few years before, proofs of memory safety had been done only for toy programs in the tens or sometimes hundreds of lines of code. 

 Infer is based on these foundations and was initially commercialised by the Queen Mary spin\-off, Monoidics Ltd, from 2009. Monoidics’ Infer product attracted customers from across the world including government agencies and industrial clients such as Airbus, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and ARM Holdings.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Infer detects memory violations in computer programs with hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of code. Before its development, proofs of memory safety had been done only for programs in the tens or sometimes hundreds of lines of code. 

#  Facebook acquisition of Monoidics 

 Monoidics is a Queen Mary spin out company co\-founded, in 2009, by Distefano, which grew to include offices in the UK, USA and Japan. Monoidics marketed Infer, an automatic program verification tool built on Distefano’s proofs \[3.1\-3.4\]. In July 2013, Monoidics was acquired by Facebook to improve the quality and the security of their code base. 

 Since the acquisition, the development of Infer has been carried out at Facebook, where Infer is now an established technology for software quality. The Facebook code is an evolving system, updated frequently and concurrently by many developers. It is not unusual for more than a thousand modifications to the mobile code to be submitted for review in a given day. Infer reports quickly on these code modifications, in the region of 10 minutes, to fit in with developers’ workflow. Coping with this scale and velocity required the advanced mathematical techniques of separation logic and bi\-abduction provided by Distefano’s research. Bryan O’Sullivan, director of Developer Efficiency at Facebook, said \[5.1\]: “Today within Facebook, the verification technology originally designed by Prof. Dino Distefano and colleagues contributes to the quality of the products we serve to over 2,000,000,000 people every day. Currently Infer analyses every applicable code change within Facebook and its family of apps \(Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus\). Every month, thousands of issues are fixed before these apps are shipped to users. Thus, Infer has saved Facebook engineers innumerable hours that they would have had to spend debugging the problems it detected, had those problems reached production *.*” In the second half of 2017 alone, more than 25,000 bugs reported by Infer were fixed by Facebook developers. 

#  Use of Infer as an Open Source tool 



#  Figure 1: Screen grab from fbinfer.com, showing some infer users. Copyright \[2020\] by fbinfer.com. 

 Infer was open sourced in 2015 \[5.2\].  Since then, it has been used by many companies and developers around the world \(including Amazon Web Services \[5.3\], Uber, Spotify, Mozilla, Sky, Mark & Spencer\) \[5.4\]. Infer is used in diverse ways by these companies: 

 *Facebook and Spotify* use it for user generated content apps, and thus the development of their software as it is continuously released to users. Deniz Türkoglu, Software Engineer at Spotify in 2016 said \[5.5\], “At Spotify we are continuously working on making our codebase better, and in the Android infrastructure team we use a lot of tools: static analyzers, linters, thread/address sanitizers, etc. In our quest to make our code even better, we started using Infer. Infer found several legitimate issues that other tools had missed. Infer is a great add\-on to a company’s toolbox. It’s not intrusive — you can simply add it to your flow and it will tell you where you forgot to close that cursor or leaked that context.” 

 *Amazon and Uber* use Infer for their online marketplaces. Manu Sridharan, software engineer at Uber in 2016 said \[5.6\], ""In 2016, Uber deployed the Facebook Infer tool for static detection of potential NullPointerExceptions \(NPEs\). Alongside our Runtime Annotation Validation Engine \(RAVE\) validation, the tool reduced the number of NPEs observed in our apps in production by an order of magnitude.""

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Research from Sheffield Hallam University has influenced policy making, professional practice, and public and professional understanding of gambling\-related harm. Beneficiaries of this research include regulatory agencies in the UK, Asia, Australia and Europe. Banks and colleagues’ research informed the UK Gambling Commission's national strategy to reduce gambling harms and their threat assessment of crime problems pertaining to gambling. It has also motivated the Australian government to block access to illegal gambling websites. By giving voice to family members of individuals with gambling problems, Sheffield Hallam’s research has benefitted those experiencing gambling\-related harm, by evidencing the need for increased treatment and support. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Banks and colleagues have undertaken some of the first research to respond to the global expansion of gambling and the harm it has caused. The liberalisation, economic deregulation and normalisation of gambling that has occurred in many states and jurisdictions across the world has heightened both the range and the potency of gambling products and services available to citizens. Over the last decade, online gambling has been a key propellant of citizens’ gambling expenditure, industry profits and state taxation revenues, with UK citizens losing £5.3 billion gambling remotely in 2019 alone. In addition, the most recent figures released by the Gambling Commission suggest that there are in the region of 395,000 individuals with gambling problems in Britain and a further 1.8 million gamblers ‘at risk’ of developing a problem. Gambling\-related harm not only impacts individual gamblers, but extends to family members, friends and others in the community, with the typical problem gambler affecting, on average, six other people. This research has uncovered, examined and furthered understanding of the multitude of serious harms associated with the proliferation of opportunities to gamble, and informed policy, practice and criminal justice responses. Sheffield Hallam’s research can be divided into two distinct but interconnected areas of research. 

####  1. Gambling\-related crime 

 Research examining gambling\-related crime involved: a systematic review of international literature; an environmental scan of news media, textual and visual analyses of e\-gambling advertising; analysis of the records of player\-protection and standards organisations; an innovative 18\-month virtual ethnography of online gamblers; and interviews with gambling regulators. The research detailed the manifold actual, possible and probable interconnections between gambling and crime in the context of the increased availability of wagering activities across many regions of the world \[ **R1**\]. It demonstrated the ways in which gambling and crime are approached in practice by gamblers, regulatory agencies and gambling operators. Collectively, this work offered the first empirically driven assessment of the extent and nature of criminogenic harms that result from the proliferation of opportunities to gamble \[ **R1**\- **R5**\]. 

 The research demonstrated the challenges of regulating mixed modes of gambling in a digital era and how player protection processes can be advanced through technological, legal and social responses \[ **R2**, **R3**\]. It also highlighted how criminal justice policy makers and practitioners have been slow to respond to the crime and criminal justice implications of gambling, and how a public health response to gambling\-related harm necessitates the institution of awareness raising, screening and treatment within criminal justice settings \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. In addition, the research led to the development of a taxonomy of gambling\-related crime that enables regulators to identify and explore the extent, nature and organisational dynamics of sub\-types of gambling\-related offending, whilst identifying the actors and legislation that can be exercised in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of such crimes \[ **R4**\]. Sheffield Hallam’s research into betting shop robberies highlighted how they often take place at night when lone working is more likely to occur and typically involve violence or the threat of violence, and the use of a weapon \[ **R5**\]. It demonstrated that greater guardianship of betting shop premises, through an increase in the number of 'frontline' personnel, particularly at night, could help to reduce the risk to retail staff. 

####  2. Gambling\-related harm 

 Research on gambling\-related harm incorporated: the first UK survey of family members and friends affected by problem gambling, the first UK survey exploring gambling\-related family violence, and semi\-structured interviews with gamblers and family members. This work was funded by the Responsible Gambling Trust \(£28,883\), GambleAware \(£44,407\) and the British Academy \(£9,742\) and supported by a range of treatment and support providers including National Problem Gambling Clinic, Gamcare, Gordon Moody Association, Adfam, BetKnowmore, Citizens Advice and branches of Gamblers Anonymous/GamAnon. The principal purpose of this research \[R6\] was to be the first UK study to give voice to family members, friends and other loved ones of individuals with gambling problems \- in order to document their lived experience, with a view to shaping policy and best practice relating to the education, prevention and treatment of gambling\-related harm. Collectively, the research demonstrated the impact that problem gambling can have on families and friends, the strategies they employ to try to cope with a loved one's gambling problem, their help\-seeking behaviour, and the barriers to help\-seeking. The research identified two broad interconnected considerations for policy makers and practitioners. First, there is a need to raise societal and professional awareness and understanding of gambling and its impact on families. Second, family members identified a need for improved access to and availability of support for affected others.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research conducted across the assessment period had several key impacts, deepening public and professional understandings of, and responses to, gambling\-related harm, both nationally and internationally. This included contributing to policy and regulatory change, and increased help and support for individuals and families experiencing gambling\-related harm. 

####  1. Policy and Regulatory Responses to Gambling\-Related Harm Across International Jurisdictions 

 Sheffield Hallam’s research demonstrating the multitude harms experienced by families of individuals with gambling problems \[ **R6**\] has contributed, through Best's involvement, to the development of a framework for measuring gambling\-related harms in 2018, which is utilised in **the <ins>United Kingdom's</ins> first National Strategy to Reduce Gambling\-Related Harms** \[ **E1**\]. Banks was also invited in August 2019 by Great Britain's sole gambling regulator and gaming law supervisor, the Gambling Commission, to join a multi\-disciplinary expert academic panel to provide research evidence to support the delivery of the three\-year strategy \[ **E2**\]. As the Gambling Commission Chair William Moyes recognised in his keynote address at the launch of the strategy on 25 April 2019, the experiences of those affected by gambling *""have played a significant part in shaping this strategy""*, which outlines a partnership approach to delivering two strategic priority areas: prevention and education, and treatment and support. 

 The research \[ **R3**\] contributed to the development of a taxonomy for considering gambling\-related crime, through consultation with advisory agency Regulus Partners, working on behalf of the Gambling Commission. As well as helping the Gambling Commission to chart the area for the purpose of risk assessment, the taxonomy was used as a framework through which the Gambling Commission was able to compile an overview of gambling\-related crime in Great Britain \[ **E6**\]. The taxonomy was developed further by Banks, in partnership with Waugh \(Regulus Partners\), in order to enable jurisdictional comparability and information sharing between regulators in different locations across the world, with a view to addressing locally based offending and enhancing collaborative responses to international crime problems, such as money laundering, fraud, theft, extortion and match fixing. 

 In **Australia**, two Sheffield Hallam studies \[ **R1**, **R4**\] into online gambling were cited as part of the Australian government’s response to Recommendation 15 from the 2015 O’Farrell Review into Illegal Offshore Wagering, which proposed that state and territory governments, in conjunction with industry, should take steps to increase consumer awareness about the risks relating to personal finances and information that result from using prohibited online gambling services \[ **E3**\]. Our research was used in a 2017 research report commissioned by the **Australian government to illustrate how interactive gambling is not immune to criminal exploitation.** In response to the review, in 2019 the Morrison Government instituted several measures to protect Australian citizens, who spend $400 million annually at illegal offshore gambling websites, which are prohibited services under the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. By recognising the risks posed by illegal offshore gambling operators, for the first time, the Australian Communications and Media Authority was empowered to work in cooperation with Australian Internet Service Providers to block their websites. 

 **Malta** is second only to the UK in terms of the size of its online gambling market and Sheffield Hallam research has informed the regulation of 294 gaming companies who have been issued with 625 remote gaming licenses. The research has **informed criminal probity checks in the Malta Gaming Authority** \(MGA\) \[ **E4**\] through our ongoing work with the former Senior Executive Officer in the Criminal Probity Screening Department, who is now Head of the Sports Integrity Unit at the MGA. Sheffield Hallam studies \[ **R1**, **R2**, **R4**\] highlighted avenues for fraud and money laundering in online gambling, and limitations in regulatory measures. The MGA report that Banks’ monographs \[ **R1**, **R2**\] detail *“responses to illegal gambling, money laundering and fraud and theft at online gaming sites that are of practical use to researchers, industry and regulators.”* \[ **E4**\]. 

 Sheffield Hallam research was drawn upon by the **Asian Racing Federation’s \(ARA\) Anti\-Illegal Betting \(AIB\) Taskforce's examination of illegal betting in <ins>Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea**</ins>, to illustrate the direct and indirect costs illegal betting brings to societies. ARA's Due Diligence and Research Manager has outlined how this research has been employed to educate the AIB Taskforce \- as well as a host of stakeholders, including media, politicians and sporting governing bodies \- about threats to the integrity of sports betting and to inform their enforcement efforts. He highlighted how: *“We found… Gambling, Crime and Society* \[ **R1**\] *very useful in several instances to illustrate the direct and indirect costs illegal betting brings to societies.”* \[ **E5**\]. 

####  2. Increasing Support for Families and Friends Affected by Gambling\-Related Harm 

 The research into gambling\-related harm **gave voice to family members and other loved ones of individuals with gambling problems, whose views, opinions and experiences were absent from social policy debate.** This rare opportunity was highlighted by one research participant who noted that: *“I think, for me, this is the first time that I'm really talking about my personal experiences, so it's been useful for me… I want to contribute towards the change…towards what it is that you're doing that could hopefully create hope for other people, including myself.”* \[ **R6**\]. Preliminary findings from the study were presented at a Gambling and Families roundtable event \[ **E7**\], hosted by Adfam in November 2017, with a view to identifying the need for support for families experiencing gambling\-related harm. The research team provided empirical evidence to demonstrate that families experienced significant and sustained harm across multiple domains, as a consequence of gambling, and that current support \- whilst highly valued by service users \- was insufficient to meet demand and further funding was necessary. In 2018, Adfam, who supported the Families Living with Problem Gambling project, were awarded £180,000 grant for a three\-year period by GambleAware to extend their alcohol and drugs services to gambling, where previously none existed \- to support, educate and empower families and frontline workers. 

####  3. Influencing Public Understanding and Professional Discourse on Gambling\-Related Harm 

 Sheffield Hallam research \[ **R1**\- **R4**\] has contributed to the **recognition that UK gambling laws are not fit for a digital age, leading to a government review of the Gambling Act 2005**, launched on 8 December 2020 \[ **E8**\]. Evidence was submitted to the House of Lords Select Committee on the Social and Economic Impact of the Gambling Industry \(2019\) and Banks is quoted extensively in the report Gambling Harm \- Time for Action \(2020\), particularly around the risks of lone working in betting shops \[ **R5**\]. Banks is part of a group of UK academics who published an open letter in the British Medical Journal in July 2020 to the Secretaries of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and for Health and Social Care, urging them to introduce a statutory levy on gambling companies, to deliver reductions in gambling harms. Research findings \[ **R1**\- **R5**\] have also been submitted to the Howard League's Commission on Crime and Problem Gambling's call for evidence \(2019\) into the links between crime and problem gambling, and published in the report *Crime and Problem Gambling: A Research Landscape \- The Report of the Commission on Crime and Problem Gambling* \(2020\). 

 In addition, Banks was invited to join the International Gambling Think Tank, presenting at the 2017 meeting in Banff, Canada, on responsible online gambling \[ **E9**\]. Organised and coordinated by the Gambling and Addictions Research Centre at Auckland University of Technology, the Think Tank is an international network of researchers, policy makers, service providers and interested others, collaborating to advance understanding of gambling and to reduce gambling\-related harm. Sheffield Hallam research has also been translated into plain language summaries or 'rapid communications' by the Gambling Commission's partner, the Gambling Research Exchange Ontario, in order to communicate this work to policy makers, practitioners and other non\-academic audiences across the world \[ **E10**\].

 Evidence suggests that 850,000 children and young people have a diagnosable mental health problem and that mental ill health is increasing for staff who work within all sectors of education. The Centre of Excellence for Mental Health’s research was used to create a framework for schools and colleges that enables them to implement institution wide approaches to support mental wellbeing. The framework, which leads to a mental health award for schools and colleges once evidenced, has been adopted nationally and overseas by nearly 1000 settings across primary, secondary, independent and international schools as well as Further Education Colleges. Our evaluation of the framework demonstrates that the framework improved wellbeing in pupils in 84% of schools and wellbeing of staff in 87% of schools and has led to improvements in pupils’ attitudes towards mental health. Our data also suggest that the framework helped to reduce stigma in relation to mental health, created a more positive culture in schools for pupils and improved the mental health curriculum in schools. Additionally, this initiative supported the development and enhancement of the reputation of a social enterprise.

 **2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\)** 

 Evidence suggests that one in ten young people has some form of diagnosable mental health condition and there is evidence that schools and colleges play a vital role in identifying needs and referring children onto specialist services where this is required \(DfE, DoH, 2017\). The Centre was established in 2017 to support schools and colleges to develop evidence\-based institutional\-wide approaches to support the mental health of children and young people. The Centre is a partnership between the Carnegie School of Education and the social enterprise Minds Ahead. The Centre has developed programmes of professional development for school and pastoral leaders and teachers delivered nationally and internationally. Additionally, the Centre has developed a research informed framework to support schools and colleges in developing high quality mental health provision. 

 Our research in the Centre demonstrates the significance of promoting staff wellbeing as part of a whole institutional approach to mental health. Previous research \(e.g., Public Health England, 2015\) did not identify the crucial role of staff wellbeing within its whole school approach to mental health. Through a systematic review of existing research \(R.1\), we were able to identify the critical elements of the whole school approach to mental health. In 2018 the Centre was commissioned by Education Support, a national charity which supports the wellbeing of education staff across all sectors of education, to conduct research into teacher wellbeing. The research explored the factors which impacted on teacher wellbeing and the impact of poor teacher wellbeing on pupils, addressing a significant research gap in the field.  Through our research with teachers and school leaders we highlighted ways in which the wellbeing of staff can affect the wellbeing and progress of children and young people \(R.2\). We interviewed 64 children to explore their perceptions of the impact of poor teacher mental ill health. We also piloted and evaluated educational interventions to improve young people’s mental health \(R.3; R.4\). We used the findings of the research to develop a framework to support schools and colleges to develop whole institutional approaches to mental health. Based on the findings of our research, one strand of the framework was developed to support schools with addressing the wellbeing of staff. In conjunction with Minds Ahead we subsequently developed a programme of professional development which focused on all aspects of the whole institutional approach to mental health. This programme was rolled out across the UK and the UAE to teachers, pastoral leaders, and school leaders. We also developed a programme of online professional development for governing bodies.

 **4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)** 

 The School Mental Health Award and programmes of professional development provided by the Centre have reached schools in all regions and local authorities in the UK and internationally, including schools in Dubai and Abu Dhabi: 993 schools have begun or completed the Mental Health Award and we have delivered 96 CPD sessions to colleagues from more than 1850 schools and colleges and three Mental Health in Schools Knowledge Exchange conferences with 350 attendees. The framework which underpins the School Mental Health award and CPD has transformed school cultures through reducing the stigma associated with mental ill health and through creating positive environments for children and staff which promote a positive sense of wellbeing. 

 **Improving wellbeing and attitudes towards mental health in children and young people** 

 Quantitative evaluation data indicate that the work of the Centre led to improvements in young people’s wellbeing in 84% of schools. This is supported by the findings in the Impact Report \(S8\) which demonstrate how the framework has supported school leaders to more systematically measure and monitor pupils’ wellbeing. The framework has enabled leaders to monitor trends in pupils’ wellbeing over time and provide rapid interventions to support wellbeing and mental health literacy such as creating a designated wellbeing senior lead, pupil wellbeing surveys, including mental health in school improvement plans and creating pupil wellbeing champions. Our work in schools across a single local authority, Derby, for example demonstrated significant improvements in pupils’ mental health literacy from 66.7% \(N = 557\) to 72.4% \(N = 507\) \(R4\). One respondent in our evaluation \(S4\) stated that “Well\-Being is at the forefront of everything we do. We continue to learn, support and build on mental health and the needs of every child. Knowing we have achieved this Award gives us even more confidence to continue our mission\!” 

 Quantitative evaluation data also indicate that the work of the Centre supported the development of more positive school cultures in 91% of participating schools and that pupils’ attitudes in relation to mental health improved in 81% of participating schools. Examples of positive changes include reduction in stigma, increased willingness to reach out and ask for help and an increased willingness to turn to peers for support \(R.3\). The British School in the United Arab Emirates \(S1\), for example, introduced a three week focus on mental health in the curriculum, created a senior group of Prefects to focus on student wellbeing and ensure that mental health became a regular conversation within the school. In the UK, Wath Victoria Primary \(S6\) found that having a senior teacher responsible for mental health changed the culture and ethos of the school, with new policies and operations taking account of the impact on staff and pupil wellbeing. Further examples of impact are included in the evaluation report \(S8\) including the introduction of universal approaches to identifying mental ill health in schools and the introduction of systematic approaches for measuring the impact of mental health interventions in schools. This is supported by quantitative evaluation data indicating that stigma in relation to mental health was reduced in 94% of participating schools. 

 The impact of the award was also highlighted during school inspections. For example, the Ofsted report for Burton Leonard Church of England Primary made note of the fact that the school was working towards the School Mental Health Award and that it had contributed to a ‘much more settled start to each morning for identified pupils’ and that ‘academic outcomes are also improving for these pupils as a result’. 

 **Improving staff wellbeing** 

 Quantitative evaluation data indicate that staff wellbeing was enhanced in 87% of participating schools. The Head of a school in the North of England said “The 15 members of staff that completed the professional development programme have shown greater resilience and are better able to deal with situations that may have overwhelmed them. And they have taken these skills into other aspects of their lives.” Data from the Impact Report \(S8\) documents the range of initiatives that schools have adopted to increase staff wellbeing: staff wellbeing mentors were introduced; confidential access to school counsellors was provided; wellbeing was embedded within the existing coaching system; professional development became more sophisticated and expanded to include managing specific mental health conditions such as stress and anxiety. Strategies also included reducing unnecessary workload for staff and making staff wellbeing a strategic priority, all of which resulted in a reduction in staff absence and improved staff retention and wellbeing. A school Principal in Dubai commented that “The framework has enabled us to focus on reducing staff workload. Staff now feel more valued, trusted and have increased agency and autonomy”. 

 **Enhancing the development and reputation of a social enterprise** 

 The Centre is a formal partnership with a social enterprise company, Minds Ahead. Minds Ahead and Leeds Beckett University have used the research \(R1\) to develop a suite of professional development programmes for teachers, school leaders and governors. In 2017 the research led to the introduction of a master’s degree programme in the Leadership of School Mental Health and Wellbeing which is jointly delivered by the university and Minds Ahead. To date 65 school leaders have participated in this programme across the UK and the UAE. Between 2017\-20 Minds Ahead has recruited additional staff to support the delivery of its research\-informed professional development programmes. School leaders across the UK and overseas have participated in these programmes and the impact of this on children and young people has been far reaching. The CEO for Minds Ahead stated that the partnership with Leeds Beckett university has provided “ongoing income for Minds Ahead, which has grown over time as activities expanded. This has also allowed Minds Ahead to bid for government contracts, which would have otherwise been impossible for a new start\-up”. 

 **Improving the mental health curriculum in schools** 

 The Centre was commissioned by Cambridge United Community Trust in 2017\-18 to support the development and evaluation of a school mental health curriculum intervention led by coaches from Cambridge United football club \(R4\).  The Trust was commissioned the Centre to undertake this work due to the reputation that the Centre had established as a result of its research and enterprise. The evaluation led to the further subsequent roll out of the intervention across all secondary schools in Cambridgeshire and the intervention has been refined as a result of the evaluation and sustained. The intervention led to improved mental health literacy and improved wellbeing for 550 children and young people in all participating schools \(see R.4\). One teacher commented that “students now have a bank of strategies to help them to manage stress and anxiety and I have seen them using them at school.  They have also told me that they use them at home”. 

 **Bupa Foundation Collaboration** 

 In 2020, the Centre partnered with the Bupa Foundation to produce a series of podcasts to support schools in preparing to meet the mental health and wellbeing needs of staff and children when they returned after lockdown \( [https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/research/carnegie\-centre\-of\-excellence\-for\-mental\-health\-in\-schools/carnegie\-bupa\-seminars](https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/research/carnegie-centre-of-excellence-for-mental-health-in-schools/carnegie-bupa-seminars)\).  The series focused on the four key areas that arose from the underpinning research: embedding mental health in the curriculum; school staff wellbeing; promoting positive mental health in school; developing a mental health policy. 689 participants accessed the content and the evaluation revealed the effectiveness of the series: using a scale from 1 \(poor\) to 5 \(excellent\), the series scored 4.48 for the effect of raising confidence in supporting staff mental health on their return to school and 4.68 in confidence in supporting children’s mental health. All respondents said they would recommend the series and added qualitative comments including the following examples: ‘They were informative and easy to follow. Some great advice’; ‘This was fantastic CPD for me and I found the wealth of knowledge and resources really useful’.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This project on the hidden and neglected story of Cheltenham’s Lower High Street has had a beneficial impact in two main areas. First, by fostering a more sensitive appreciation of the area’s neglected role in Cheltenham’s social and economic development, it increased ‘Understanding and Awareness’. Second, it has altered ‘attitudes’ by using community oral history to challenge the negative stigmatization that has resulted from the neglect of the Lower High Street, something which has been a source of spatial as well as social division in Cheltenham. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Traditionally home to the town’s poorer, working\-class communities, Cheltenham’s Lower High Street has been marked by a visible physical deterioration and institutional neglect over many years, meaning it represents a marginalized community that suffers from ‘symbolic annihilation’ \(Caswell, 2014\). With the University acting as an ‘anchor institution’ \(Alix Green *et al*, 2013\) and collaborating with community organizations such as the Cheltenham West End Partnership \(CWEP\) and the Cheltenham Civic Society  \(CCS\), the research team developed a community\-based project which aimed to integrate this neglected area into Cheltenham’s uneven heritage landscape, and address some of the issues of social and class division that have characterized Cheltenham‘s history. 

 The project had two main elements. First, it was based on oral history research with former and existing residents. Testimonies gave voice to unacknowledged experiences of social marginalization and economic hardship, but also foregrounded positive recollections of a resilient and tight\-knit community. The memories helped to establish the area’s distinctive ‘sense of place,’ which is rooted in a working\-class experience. By volunteering to take part in the project, and in their collective nostalgic responses, the interviewees revealed a significant grassroots willingness to challenge the exclusionary practices of Cheltenham’s Regency narrative, and reclaim the Lower High Street as a significant site of memory \(O’Connell, 2020\). 

 The second element of the project was focused on creating spaces to bring participants and various members of the community together to engage with the oral histories. The testimonies were the basis of two interactive public exhibitions which included the screening of a short documentary film with interviewees, a one\-day symposium, and a permanent virtual exhibition via the project  [website](https://cc4hh.co.uk/other-projects/). These events provided spaces for participants and visitors to share experiences, provide additional information, and take ownership of the discussion on the history as well as the future of the area. The exhibitions were designed around a poem about the Lower High Street that was anonymously sent to researchers, demonstrating how the focus of the research was framed around the ideas and sentiments of participants. The team invited interviewees to contribute to a short documentary film that brought the testimonies to life. The exhibitions were held at Chapel Arts gallery in June and December of 2017, whereas the film was screened on Civic Day in June 2017 and then made publicly available online. Importantly, new participants continue to make contributions to the project via the website as well the project’s social media platforms, so the project acts as growing and evolving archive for the community. Researchers also organised a one\-day symposium in June 2017 which brought together historians, local government, community\-based organisations and residents. The symposium formed the basis for what Andrew Hurley \(2010\) calls the necessary ‘collective stewardship’ required to challenge the exclusionary forces of local heritage practices. In this sense, the project provides a model for Universities to act as ‘anchor institutions’ and working with local organisations to address social and economic issues in their unique geographical and cultural contexts.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The project team adopted three main evaluation methods: 

1.  **Exhibition Feedback, June 2017:** 

 General feedback was gathered from both participants and visitors to the exhibitions on a voluntary basis, through contact details left at the exhibitions, and on the project website. We gathered dozens of comments in a booklet which indicate the way the project connected with the experiences of visitors, and also revealed the areas hidden story to Cheltonians from other areas: 

 ‘Fantastic and thought\-provoking’. 

 ‘As a Cheltonian, I had to think hard about how this part of the town has changed since the 50s, and to consider people’s comments.’ 

 These comments demonstrate the way in which the exhibition was challenging assumptions, especially for those less familiar with the area. 

1.  **Online Impact Survey, 2019\-20:** 

 The exhibition feedback has been corroborated by the results of our survey that captured visitors to the project website and social media pages. This has received 124 responses, 76% of whom had lived or worked in Cheltenham’s LHS area. Importantly, 41.9% of respondents were not directly involved with project, and were responding to their engagement with the virtual exhibition and film, highlighting the project was able to reach a significant audience even after its main public events: 

 <ins>Understanding & Awareness:</ins> 

 81% of respondents agreed/strongly agreed the project gave them a greater understanding of the area’s history. In addition 83% agreed/strongly agreed that the project had increased public awareness of this history. The survey also explored other specific benefits: 

  1.  Have become more aware of area’s history = 57.9%

 59% agreed/strongly agreed that it made their views about the area more positive. Furthermore, 42.1% felt proud of their connection to the area as a result of project, and 27.37% believed it has helped people think differently about the area, as supported by comments: 

 ‘It is great to see how many former residents of the \[Lower High Street\] came forward to share their memories. There is still a bit of snobbery about it from those who live elsewhere in the town but I know several people who now think differently about it and consider it to be one of the places to visit for non\-British food purchases and very eclectic dining experiences.’ 

1.  **Testimonials:** 

 Impact testimonials were gathered from key project partners who corroborated the impact both locally and more widely. Locally, the project has raised awareness of the hidden history of the Lower High Street, while also contributing to a previously unknown sense of pride. Maxine Melling of CCS commented that the ‘project was significant in helping people who lived and worked in the area to tell their stories and to share experiences.’ As Bernice Thomson of CWEP \(who work actively in the community\) acknowledged, the project provided spaces for community organisations to reach and engage new stakeholders, and for different organisations to begin collaborating: 

 ‘we were able to talk to people who would otherwise have been difficult to reach and engage with, which was very positive for us as an organisation… This research raised the profile of the Lower High Street and encouraged people to feel proud of it, which is very significant for us.’ 

 Kishi Allebone of Unit 1 Films remarked that the ‘project highlighted a real sense of regional community. We felt and saw a sense of pride in the Lower High Street and, in turn, I felt proud of my own connection with Cheltenham.’ This sense of pride was reflected in the testimonies of project participants in the short film made for the exhibition, and now permanently on the project website. 

 The testimonial by *Coronation Street* actor Simon Gregson speaks to the project’s broader national reach. The research was used for the ITV documentary ‘Coronation Street’s DNA Secrets’ \(Sep 2018\). The project provided information and context for Gregson’s ancestry in Cheltenham that would have otherwise been unavailable. His statement indicates the ways in which the project has helped bring wider attention to the hidden working\-class history of Cheltenham, and how his preconceptions about the town’s history had been challenged: 

 ‘To learn of the dire conditions my ancestors lived in and the stark divide between them   and the rich folks in their comfortable abodes on the other side of town proved to me that you really needed grit and tenacity to survive as a pauper in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. I hope that I’ve inherited some of that perseverance from my ancestors from the wrong side of the tracks in Cheltenham.’

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Professor Ian Martin introduces new ways to forecast the behaviour of stock markets and currency markets. His approaches have been used by the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee in formulating their views on exchange rates; by the European Central Bank in their monetary policy discussions; and by global asset management companies to improve aspects of their asset allocation and to inform their approach to foreign currency exposure. As well as improving understanding of risk premia, the research has informed changes in key aspects of financial practice in both the public and private sector. By helping investors take better\-informed risks, supporting the development of more robust monetary policy, and helping central banks to spot destabilising market “bubbles”, the work supports efforts to maintain stable financial systems in the UK and elsewhere. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research underpinning impacts described here was published between 2013 and 2020 in a series of papers introducing new ways to forecast a different type of financial asset. Several conclusions emerge from the papers, the most important of which is that risk premia are substantially more volatile, both over time and across stocks, than the literature has previously acknowledged. 

 Research carried out between 2013 and 2017 \(published in **\[1\]**\) defined a new index of volatility \- the SVIX index. This is similar to the VIX index created by the Chicago Board Options Exchange \(CBOE\), a real\-time market index that represents the market's expectation of 30\-day forward\-looking volatility. Derived from the price inputs of the S&P 500 index options, Martin’s SVIX index provides a measure of both market risk and investors' sentiments. The distinctive feature of the new index is that it has a natural application to measuring the expected return on the market \- the so\-called “equity premium”. The properties of the index were studied empirically using the OptionMetrics database of historical option prices to construct the index for the period 1996\-2012 \(at that time the full period for which option price data was available\). This showed that the equity premium is \(even\) more volatile than had previously been understood. 

 A second paper **\[2\]** reported on work carried out from 2015 to 2018. This built on research published in **\[1\]** to derive a formula for the expected return on a stock, based on observable option prices. Martin and his co\-author Christian Wagner \(Professor of Finance, WU Vienna University of Economics and Business\) then constructed the relevant option price indices called for by that new formula; that is, they extended the indices constructed in **\[1\]** to cover individual stocks. Specifically, the new approach supplies an inherently forward\-looking measure of expected returns at the stock level, rather than the market level. This both outperforms other standard measures and makes distinctive predictions that challenge the conventional wisdom by showing that risk premia are extremely volatile across stocks \(as well as over time, as was clear from the research reported in **\[1\]**\). The model introduced in this paper can be contrasted with the Capital Asset Pricing Model \(CAPM\), which uses betas to make quantitative predictions about a stock’s returns. However, CAPM betas are estimated over an historical horizon and are difficult to pin down during turbulent markets. Conversely, the option\-based model set out in **\[2\]** can be estimated in real time because it *only* uses option prices; it also performs well empirically, unlike CAPM. 

 In parallel work conducted with PhD student Lukas Kremens between 2016 and 2018, Martin made new theoretical and empirical contributions to the classic \- and notoriously difficult \- challenge of forecasting exchange rates. The resulting paper **\[3\]** was published in 2019. Much of the existing literature in this field is organised around the theory of uncovered interest parity \(UIP\), which states that the difference in interest rates between two countries will equal the relative change in currency foreign exchange rates over the same period. The strictest form of UIP supposes risk neutrality, such that risk premiums should be identically zero. UIP is appealing for three reasons: 1\) it is based on asset prices alone \(so is observable in real time\); 2\) it has no free parameters \(so does not require estimation\); and 3\) it has a straightforward interpretation \(as the expected currency appreciation perceived by a risk\-neutral investor\). In **\[3\]**, Martin and Kremens propose an alternative benchmark, the quanto theory, which shares these three features without also making the empirically highly implausible assumption that investors are risk\-neutral. Their quanto theory model predicts that risk\-neutral covariances between currencies and global stock markets should forecast excess currency returns. They demonstrate how to use a certain kind of derivative contract \- quanto forward contracts \- to measure these quantities. The resulting measure was shown to work very well empirically, outperforming the standard competitors \(UIP, Random Walk, and PPP\) in forecasting differential currency movements out\-of\-sample. 

 A fourth paper **\[4\]** resulted from research conducted jointly in 2018\-2019 with Can Gao, a PhD student at Imperial College London. It provides a real\-time, forward\-looking measure of “bubbliness” in stock markets. Martin and Gao define a new sentiment indicator that exploits two contrasting views of return predictability and studies its properties. The indicator, which is based on option prices, valuation ratios, and interest rates, was unusually high during the late 1990s, reflecting dividend growth expectations that the researchers proposed were unreasonably optimistic. They interpreted this as helping to reveal irrational beliefs about fundamentals. This paper demonstrates that their measure is a leading indicator of de\-trended volume, and of various other measures associated with financial fragility. The research published in **\[4\]** also makes two methodological contributions. First, it derives a new valuation\-ratio decomposition that is related to the Campbell and Shiller \(1988\) log\-linearisation, but which more closely resembles the traditional Gordon growth model, as well as having certain other advantages. Second, it introduces a volatility index that provides a lower bound on the market’s expected log return. 

 A fifth paper **\[5\]** extends the novel framework introduced in papers **\[1\]**\- **\[4\]** in a different direction. It provides an index of stock market return autocorrelation using yet another kind of derivative security, namely forward\-start options.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research published in **\[1\]**\- **\[4\]** introduces new ways to forecast the behaviour of various financial asset markets. A distinctive feature of these new methods is their reliance only on observable asset prices, making the resulting forecasts observable in real time. This is in contrast to forecasts based on, say, macroeconomic or accounting data, which can only be exploited by investors or policymakers with a lag. The methods have been widely used by public and private financial institutions, including central banks, national investment funds, and global investment and asset management companies. Immediate impacts include the generation of a new debate about ways to forecast financial assets; an improved understanding within financial institutions of risk premia; and changed approaches to key aspects of professional practice including asset allocation and the forecasting of exchange rates. The use of the research in these contexts helps investors take better\-informed risks. The research also supports the development of more robust monetary policy, including by providing monetary authorities with a more accurate and timely indication of market sentiment. By helping central banks to spot destabilising market “bubbles”, the work contributes to efforts to maintain stable financial systems in the UK and elsewhere. 

 **Catalysing debate and changing practice in central banks:** the principal insights of research published in **\[1\]**\- **\[4\]** have been shared widely across and within both private and public financial organisations. High\-profile examples include the invited presentation of research published in **\[2\]** and **\[4\]** at central banks including the Bank of England \(BoE\), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \(the Fed\), and the European Central Bank. Work published in **\[2\]** has also been shared with Banca d’Italia. In April 2019, **\[4\]** was one of six papers selected for presentation to and discussion by members of the Behavioural Finance Working Group of the National Bureau of Economic Research \(NBER\), a non\-profit research organisation ""committed to undertaking and disseminating unbiased economic research among public policymakers, business professionals, and the academic community"". It was also included in a  [Bank of England blog post](https://bankunderground.co.uk/2020/10/29/hubble-bubble-valuation-trouble/) published in October 2020. 

 As well as generating discussion and debate, Martin’s research has directly supported changes in thinking and practice in the central banks with which he has worked. The work has, for example, provided central banks with **new tools to support the notoriously difficult task of forecasting exchange rates**. The research set out in **\[3\]**, which provides a new way of approaching this, was presented at a conference at the BoE in June 2017. Separately, Martin was asked by the BoE in February 2017 to provide data required to compute the currency appreciation measure proposed in **\[3\]**, so that forecasts based on the measure could be supplied to its Monetary Policy Committee \(MPC\). 

 As a result of these activities, the work has been used by the MPC in formulating its views on exchange rates **\[A\]**. Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the MPC, reports using insights from the research, including **\[3\]**, *“on numerous occasions in the discussions with other members of the Monetary Policy Committee to promote a more rigorous understanding of exchange rates and risk premia, arguing against the simple UIP framework which is still commonly used, but which fails both theoretically and empirically, as \[Martin’s\] research shows”* **\[A\]**. 

 Vlieghe further notes the “ *broader impact of influence \[Martin’s\] research has had within our institution by influencing work by staff that feeds through to policymakers”*. He particularly cites work published in **\[1\]**, which has “ *been the subject of internal staff workshops”*, and **\[4\]**, which “ *is to be incorporated into the staff’s toolkit on equity valuations”*, as well as forming the basis of a staff note **\[A\]**. 

 **Supporting the development of robust monetary policy:** the impacts of Martin’s work on thinking and practice in central banks extend to its use to develop robust monetary policy. The use of his work at the **European Central Bank**, for example, is described by its Head of Capital Markets/Financial Structure \(Directorate General Monetary Policy\) as having had both conceptual and practical effects on the ways in which financial market briefings are prepared for monetary policy discussions: 

 *“On a conceptual level we started to think about the term structure of the equity risk premium \(ERP\) as a useful indicator for monetary policy… \[which\] provides us with additional information relevant for monetary policy. On a practical level we implemented several versions of SVIX\-like indicators, developed by Ian Martin, for different jurisdictions. We regularly monitor the developments in these indicators…to detect changes in market perceptions on the economic outlook and report this analysis regularly to the policymakers.”* **\[B\]** 

 The real\-time, forward\-looking measure of “bubbliness” in stock markets set out in **\[4\]** is also proving useful for monetary policymakers. Martin presented that work at the **Bank of England** in September 2019 and discussed it further in a series of follow\-on meetings with staff there. According to a senior advisor at the BoE, it was clear that the indicator developed in **\[4\]** could be particularly helpful to the work of the Bank’s Financial Stability Strategy and Risk \(FSSR\) directorate, which monitors indicators of asset valuation for signs of bubbles inflating. Most of these are valuation ratios, which often fail to give a particularly clear signal because they can be explained by other factors: high price\-to\-earnings ratios, for instance, might be explained by low discount rates, rather than signalling a bubble. The particular qualities of Martin’s indicator, by contrast, mean that any bubble signals suggested by it could, the BoE believes, “ *be received with a high level of confidence”* **\[C\]**. 

 Martin took on a formal role as an academic consultant to the BoE in 2018\-19 and is now helping its staff to operationalise the indicator developed in **\[4\]** for regular use in the Bank. This work includes computing the indicator for the FTSE 100 index \(and possibly later for sector indices such as technology stocks\). These sorts of indicators are used by policymakers in the BoE, including the Financial Policy Committee \(FPC\), in assessing risks to the UK financial system and considering whether policy measures are needed to strengthen its resilience. Martin’s measure is expected to “ *join or replace some of the existing asset\-valuation measures”* used to make these policy decisions **\[C\]**. By helping them to more accurately detect asset pricing bubbles in real time, the research contributes to efforts to maintain stability in the financial system. This contribution is confirmed by Vlieghe, who acknowledges “ *how much impact \[Martin’s\] work has had in furthering our understanding of the link between asset prices and macroeconomic fundamentals, and helping us implement practical tools can allow us to make up\-to\-date asset price assessments for financial and monetary stability purposes*” **\[A\]**. 

 **Promoting a more rigorous understanding of risk premia and forecasting financial assets in private financial institutions**: beyond its contributions to the work of central banks and monetary policymakers, the research has also been used by some of the world’s biggest private financial organisations. It has been shared with and used by global investment management corporations including BlackRock \- the world’s largest asset manager \- and quantitative investment giant AQR Capital Management. In 2017, the latter named **\[2\]** as one of five finalists for its Insight Award, which recognises “ *papers that provide the most significant, new practical insights for tax\-exempt institutional or taxable investor portfolios”*. Investment funds, including the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, have also engaged with the work, which Martin presented to them on 30 June 2017. In June 2016, it was discussed at a  [conference at the University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en/school-business-economics-law/centre-for-finance/seminars-and-conferences/conferences/cff-ap2-conference-june-7-2016), organised by one of Sweden’s public pension funds. 

 Part of the interest in these organisations has been in the implications of the work for understanding risk premia. The equity premium \- the difference between expected returns on risky portfolios or investments and the certain return on risk\-free securities or portfolios \- is one of the central quantities of finance and macroeconomics. Standard theories such as the CAPM and its successors imply that it is a central driver of asset prices, and hence one of the most important determinants of aggregate investment in a macroeconomic sense. The more accurate appraisal of forward\-looking risk premia proposed by Martin makes an important contribution to the work of financial institutions as a critical component of investment processes within asset management firms. 

 The “ *meaningful impacts”* on industry of Martin’s research are explained by Dr Brandon Bates, a former senior portfolio manager at BlackRock, who says his work: “ *teaches us* how *to think about markets,* how *to impose structure on a problem with formidable complexity”* **\[D\]**. During his seven\-year tenure at BlackRock, Bates “ *witnessed regular discussion, adoption, and adaptation of \[Martin’s\] ideas, especially \[his\] research programme of imputing measures of market expectations from derivative instruments”* **\[D\]**. 

 The work also informs more specific aspects of understanding and practice which, because of the scale at which BlackRock and others operate, have very far\-reaching effects. Examples identified by Bates include the application of the model described in **\[1\]** by staff at BlackRock in the context of asset allocation \- the division of capital across asset classes \- which Bates describes as “ *the principal driver of long\-run investment returns”*. Recognising that “ *the dynamism of \[Martin’s\] measure suggested a much richer opportunity set for tactical asset allocation than anyone at BlackRock previously thought…at least two groups at the firm created a live monitor for the measures to use in their investment processes”* **\[D\]**. 

 Paper **\[2\]** “ *also generated notable excitement…Above the direct application of using \[Martin’s\] results as a stock\-level return forecaster, it inspired an entire research agenda within the group of deriving model\-free estimates of just about every key parameter”* **\[D\]**. 

 Bates further acknowledges the use of Martin’s work at BlackRock in the context of foreign currency exposure. This he describes as being, after asset allocation, “ *the most important consideration international investors weigh”*, with currency movements explaining “ *somewhere between 20% and 40% of returns in international equity portfolios”*. He continues: 

 *“What this means is that even modest skill in forecasting currencies promises meaningful improvements in portfolio\-level performance. With approximately USD300 billion in international active equity mandates, you can imagine why \[Martin’s\] paper* \( **\[3\]**\) *…generated excitement at BlackRock…I knew of two independent replication efforts. Additionally, two prominent investment banks created and then began circulating currency return forecasts based in part on \[Martin’s\] methodology.”* **\[D\]** 

 An asset manager’s strategy for deploying planned trades to the market is informed by time series dependence in returns. In a mean\-reverting market, it is best to wait for a favourable bounce to create better entry points; in a trending market, on the other hand, it is better to complete trades sooner. Many systematic investment strategies formalise this idea by using the degree of serial correlation in returns as a central parameter in trade\-timing models. Typically, practitioners estimate this parameter using historical data, which is necessarily imperfect. According to Bates, paper **\[5\]** “ *fills an important gap in practice by providing the first forward\-looking estimate for this parameter*”. When he left BlackRock in 2019: 

 *“…several research threads were underway to productionalise \[Martin’s\] insight for assets where the options market was sufficiently liquid to support forward\-start options. If an improvement in model calibration improves returns in trade\-timing performance by even 0.01 percentage points, the gains for BlackRock’s active equity clients would be approximately USD50 million per year.”* **\[D\]** 

 Because it supports more efficient allocation of capital, this sort of improvement in appraisal ultimately delivers broader macroeconomic benefits, as well as benefits to investors.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research undertaken at the University of Hertfordshire \(UH\), in collaboration with Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust \(HPFT\), has advanced the psychobiological understanding, effective diagnosis, treatment and management of obsessive\-compulsive and related disorders. This work led to the reclassification of obsessive\-compulsive and related disorders within the World Health Organisation’s international standard for reporting diseases and health conditions, resulting in more effective diagnosis and treatment. It has led to revisions of clinical guidelines and contributed to changes in clinical practice, which have benefitted patients with debilitating conditions that can be extremely challenging to treat. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Obsessive\-Compulsive Disorder \(OCD\) affects 1\-2% of the population. It is characterised by the presence of either obsessions or compulsions, or commonly both, and can cause significant functional impairment and distress. Led by Fineberg, research by the Centre for Health Services and Clinical Research and the Cognitive Neuropsychology Research Group has investigated psychopharmacological and neurocognitive factors in OCD, and novel treatments for a condition widely recognised as very challenging to treat. Studies were carried out in collaboration with HPFT, where Fineberg is also Consultant Psychiatrist, research lead, and clinical lead of one of England’s four specialist NHS centres of excellence for the treatment of OCD. 

 **Identifying mechanistic commonalities in different OCDs ** 

 Laws and Fineberg have conducted neurocognitive and brain imaging analyses to better understand the mechanisms of OCD. They identified a common cognitive endophenotype profile in people with a range of OCD\-related disorders and demonstrated that a common set\-shifting problem exists in people diagnosed with OCD and a group of parallel psychiatric disorders. Cases of Obsessive\-Compulsive Personality Disorder \(OCPD\), a condition characterised by perfectionism, were found to show significant cognitive inflexibility coupled with executive planning deficits, whereas decision\-making remained intact. Laws and Fineberg concluded that this profile of impairment overlaps with that of OCD and implies that common neuropsychological changes affect individuals with these disorders \[ **3.1**\]. Laws and Fineberg drew similar conclusions from studies into Body Dysmorphic Disorder \(BDD\), a condition relating to perceived appearance \[ **3.2**\]. This combined work suggested a need to rethink the diagnostic classification of these conditions. The rationale for creating a new grouping of Obsessive\-Compulsive and Related Disorders, also including hoarding disorder, in the WHO’s International Classification of Diseases \(ICD\) was co\-published by Fineberg in 2016 \[ **3.3**\]. 

 **Exploring long\-term health and cost burden of OCDs and wider neurological disorders** 

 Working with Gale \(UH/HPFT\) and the Psychiatric University Hospital, Zurich, Fineberg led investigations into the impact of OC symptoms on psychosocial function and the effect of early\-onset symptoms. They concluded that clinically relevant OC syndromes start early and are associated with substantial distress, treatment\-seeking activity and, in the case of OCD, functional disability \[ **3.4**\]. Following on from this work, Fineberg led an international consensus group on early intervention, looking at how treatment in childhood can potentially avoid the most serious, hard\-to\-treat cases in later life \[ **3.5**\]. Fineberg and Wellsted used European health economic data to analyse the prevalence and the financial and long\-term health burden of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including OCDs, in the UK. The study concluded there were 45m cases of brain disorders in the UK costing £112bn a year \[ **3.6**\]. 

 **Addressing the problem of treatment\-resistant OCD** 

 Fineberg and Wellsted ran a randomised controlled feasibility study, funded by NIHR \[ **G1**\], of the clinical and cost effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy \(CBT\), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \(SSRIs\) and their combination in the management of OCD. They found that combined treatment appeared the most clinically effective option, especially over CBT, but the advantages of sertraline monotherapy were not clearly sustained beyond 16 weeks. However, sertraline monotherapy was found to be the most cost effective \[ **3.7**\]. Fineberg was a local principle investigator on the UK’s first Deep Brain Stimulation \(DBS\) study for OCD \(lead: UCL\). It found, through the treatment of six patients with treatment\-refractory OCD, that DBS could significantly reduce OCD symptoms. Following on from this, Fineberg and Wellsted were awarded an NIHR grant \[ **G2**\] to investigate transcranial stimulation as a scalable, non\-invasive alternative to DBS. 

 **Problematic Use of the Internet: an emerging mental health challenge** 

 Since 2017, Fineberg has chaired a European network \[ **G3**\] on problematic use of the internet \(PUI\) and its impact on health and wellbeing. The Action is a multidisciplinary network of researchers with broad global expertise \(including clinicians, policy makers, patients, bio\- and information\-technology industries, etc.\). The goal is to advance understanding of the psycho\-biological basis of different forms of PUI and the societal cost and burden, and to spearhead development of treatment and prevention programmes. A manifesto published by the group in 2018 establishing the key research questions has become a key point of reference in this emerging field \[ **3.8**\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research led by Fineberg at UH has advanced clinical understanding of the neuroscience underpinning OCD and the broader concept of ‘compulsivity’. The key impacts reported here stem from improved understanding of a wider group of obsessive\-compulsive and related disorders \(OCRDs\), leading to better diagnosis for patients and improved treatments. This has been achieved through a range of clinical guidelines, direct impact on clinical practice, professional education and raising public awareness. 

 **The ICD\-11: reclassification of obsessive\-compulsive disorders improves diagnosis** 

 The UH research that led to publications **3.1** and **3.2** fed directly into significant changes made to the World Health Organisation’s global standard for diagnostic health information, the new International Classification of Diseases \(ICD\-11\), which had not been updated since 1994 \[ **5.1**\]. Fineberg sat on the Workgroup on Obsessive\-Compulsive and Related Disorders, where she successfully argued for the classification of OCD and related compulsive disorders as a new diagnostic group of disorders based on a shared compulsive neurobiology. For the first time it was shown that hypochondriasis is not a somatic condition \(as per the ICD\-10 classification\) but part of a family or spectrum of OCDs. A new section for ‘Obsessive\-compulsive or related disorders’ was included \[ **5.2**\] when ICD\-11 was released in June 2018 and formally adopted by Member States in May 2019. As paper **3.3** states, this new grouping was designed to contribute to more accurate identification and appropriate treatment of affected patients. Two examples of new classifications are Hoarding Disorder and Gaming Disorder, both included for the first time. The decision to include Hoarding Disorder was described by psychiatrists as ‘ *extremely significant*’ according to reports in the Guardian and The Telegraph \[ **5.3**\]. A peer\-reviewed, multi\-author study, published online in May 2020, demonstrated the clinical efficacy of the updated ICD\-11 guidelines \[ **5.4**\]. By studying the responses of 1,717 mental health clinicians to case vignettes, use of the ICD\-11 guidelines resulted in more accurate diagnosis of OCD and related disorders compared to the ICD\-10 guidelines, particularly in differentiating presentations from one another \[ **5.4**\]. 

 **Problematic Use of the Internet \(PUI\)** 

 The COST Action group on PUI had clear aims on achieving impact on both professionals and patients. The consensus statement \[ **3.8**\] was widely covered in both general and professional media. The group produced a book aimed at the general public, *Learning to deal with Problematic Usage of the Internet* which was published on their own website and on the COST website. The group has provided research evidence and support for the new ICD\-11 diagnosis of Gaming Disorder, and has engaged with clinical colleagues and health service commissioners, successfully lobbying for development of new clinical services to treat Gaming Disorder in 2019. In October 2020, the group held a training event for clinical professionals on ‘Problematic Use of the Internet.’ This took place online and was attended by 104 people from 23 different countries globally. It was followed by an event for the general public which was attended by 77 people from 24 different countries. 

 **Changing clinical treatment and consensus guidelines for OCD and related disorders** 

 Fineberg was co\-author of the British Association for Psychopharmacology’s new guidelines on pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders, post\-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive\-compulsive disorder, published in 2014. The guidelines provided updates for diagnosis and clinical management, and further approaches for patients not responding to first\-line interventions \[ **5.5**\]. Fineberg authored Section 21: ‘Management of obsessive\-compulsive disorder’; research paper **3.4** was among those cited. Whereas the original 2005 guidelines had recommended treatment of patients with a standard SSRI dosage for 12 months to prevent relapse, the revised 2014 guidelines recommended a more nuanced approach: patients should be treated with a personalised dosage \(often higher than the standard\) for 12 months\-plus, in line with findings from the Fineberg\-led studies \[ **5.5**\]. The guidelines were in place from May 2014 to the end of the REF impact assessment period and were downloaded 9,876 times during this time \[ **5.6**\]. 

 In 2018, Fineberg successfully advocated for the 2006 NICE guidelines for OCD to be updated; to fill the immediate need for up\-to\-date, research\-based guidance, she worked with colleagues under the banner of the International College of Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Disorders \(ICOCS\) to publish a consensus statement on treatment options \[ **5.7**\]. With the same group, she led a second consensus statement on Body Dysmorphic Disorder \[ **5.8**\]; this cites paper **3.2** and other papers from the same team. 

 Fineberg, drawing on **3.1**\- **3.4**, was also instrumental in developing new, peer\-reviewed international consensus standards of care for specialist assessment and care units for OCD \[ **5.9**\]. Published in 2016, these standards were a response to the lack of consensus over the key functions that these units should perform. The new standards included recommendations relating to the quality of clinical facilities, specialist staffing, diagnostic procedures and assessment, and patient management and follow\-up. In 2018\-19 Fineberg then sat on the OCD committee for the revision of the Royal College of Psychiatrist’s standards for community mental health services \(ACOMHS\), which were published in January 2020. 

 **Impact on clinical services: the Hertfordshire Obsessive Compulsive Disorders Service** 

 The care standards described above form the basis of the clinical practice of Fineberg and colleagues at the Hertfordshire Obsessive Compulsive Disorders Service, based in Welwyn Garden City. It is one of four NHS England Commissioned OCD services providing care and treatment to people who have failed to respond to all available pharmacological and psychological treatments whilst under the care of their local NHS Mental Health Trust. According to the Service’s website: ‘ *The research expertise in applied neuroscience, provided by our services, in collaboration with the Universities of Hertfordshire and Cambridge, is used … to drive forward novel and more effective treatment interventions* \[ **5.10**\].’ Over the impact period, the service has treated 120 of the most treatment\-resistant patients from around the UK. 

 **Training and CPD for clinicians** 

 UH research also runs through a pocketbook for clinicians and patients called ‘Obsessive\-Compulsive and Related Disorders’, co\-authored by Fineberg \(with two others\) and published in 2015. It was Highly Commended in the Psychiatry category of the British Medical Association Book Awards 2016 \[ **5.11**\]. Fineberg also reviewed and updated the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ online CPD modules on OCD in 2020 based on her ongoing research \[ **5.12**\]. Fineberg leads a biannual BAP\-accredited CPD session for psychiatrists that draws on her UH research and her own practice. Around 1,500 psychiatrists have taken this session over the impact period. 

 **OCD and related disorders during COVID\-19** 

 The onset of the COVID\-19 pandemic in 2020 had a significant negative effect on mental health, particularly for people with pre\-existing anxiety\-related disorders. The general spike in anxiety about the virus fuelled existing obsessive fears of contamination in some people with OCD and further triggered harmful compulsive actions. Fineberg led a working group of clinical experts from ICOCS together with the Obsessive\-Compulsive and Related Disorders Research Network of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology to produce a consensus statement in April 2020 with the aim of delivering pragmatic guidance to clinicians for managing this complex challenge \[ **5.13**\]. In July 2020, under the PUI COST Action \[ **G3**\] she was part of an expert group which formulated consensus guidance on preventing problematic internet use during the COVID\-19 pandemic – which was an increased risk as activities such as work, socialising and education moved online \[ **5.14**\].

 **1.Summary of the impact** 

 Impacts are on decisions taken by Northern Ireland’s governing Executive, the Irish Government’s Department of Foreign Affairs \(DFA\), the Northern Ireland Office \(NIO\) and Northern Ireland’s political parties; and upon the knowledge bases of the Labour Party and the public. These impacts have been achieved via provision of expertise on the reintegration and employment of former paramilitaries, use of our four ESRC Northern Ireland General Election studies and our work with political parties on membership surveys. Impacts include a\) changes by the Northern Ireland Executive on employer recruitment of individuals with conflict\-related convictions; b\) anti\-sectarian dialogue with Unionists by Sinn Féin; c\) rejection by the Ulster Unionist Party \(UUP\) of merger with the Democratic Unionist Party \(DUP\); d\) restructuring by Unionist parties to improve gender balance e\) adoption of proposals to restore the Northern Ireland Assembly by the British and Irish governments f\) training on the Good Friday Agreement \(GFA\) for Labour Party members and g\) media acknowledgement of our assistance in informing the public on key political issues.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research is as follows: 

 On reintegrating former prisoners, via various research projects \(including a Leverhulme Trust study on Abandoning the Past \(Principal Investigator \(PI\) Shirlow; Co Investigator \(CI\) Tonge\)\) involving interviews with 150\+ republican and loyalist former prisoners, yielding a book and journal articles \(example article at 3.1\). Our research showed that the Northern Ireland Executive had not met commitments to prisoner reintegration in terms of removing legal barriers to employment, as required in the Good Friday Agreement \(GFA\), rendering ex\-prisoners subject to high levels of unemployment. Those holding convict\-related convictions could be legally vetted and restricted from access to financial services, travel, adoption rights and employment. 

 Measurement of public opinion via a\) Tonge’s PI and Shirlow’s CI roles on the 2010, 2015, 2017 & 2019 ESRC Northern Ireland General Election surveys \(3.2\) involved the design and conduct of large surveys of the Northern Ireland electorate’s party choices and political attitudes. Data from each are lodged at the UK Data Service and findings published in articles \(e.g. *Party Politics* \(3.5\) showing how generational effects outweigh party ones on attitudes to same\-sex marriage and abortion\). Our findings, presented to the Northern Ireland Office and Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, demonstrated how extensively the public desired devolution’s restoration, even though its institutions have been unstable. We showed: a\) support for the devolved Executive and Assembly created by the GFA remained extensive \(above 75% among unionists and nationalists\) even when those institutions were suspended between 2017\-19; b\) widespread \(88%\) opposition to direct rule from Westminster; c\) extensive cross\-community support \(70%\+\) for key power\-sharing principles, notably that the Executive must contain unionists and nationalists and that legislation should require support from elected representatives from both main traditions; d\) Cultural issues are the biggest sources of division, e.g. 92% of unionists opposed an Irish Language Act whereas 93% of nationalists wanted one; e\) Majority nationalist and unionist backing for social liberalization re same\-sex marriage and abortion laws; e\) Continuing inter\-communal division over Brexit, with 65% of unionists favouring EU departure and 85% of nationalists opposed, although Brexit had not thus far greatly reshaped constitutional preferences. 

 Research on political parties was undertaken via e,g. Tonge’s PI role on a Leverhulme Trust membership study of the Democratic Unionist Party \(DUP\) \(2012\-14\) and a similar study of the Ulster Unionist Party \(UUP\) \(2016\-18\). Both studies were published as Oxford University Press books. \(3.3 and 3.4\). This research undertook the first\-ever quantitative surveys of the DUP and UUP memberships, accompanied by almost 200 interviews with grassroots members, elected representatives and the leaderships of each party, along with focus groups. Findings included: a\) Strong opposition to merger with the DUP among UUP members, despite 3 sets of unity talks between the parties 2010\-17; b\) In addition to the near absence of Catholics \(less than 1% of the membership of either party\) women are under\-represented, with both parties more than 70% male; c\) Our membership studies showed most unionist party *members* opposed legalizing same\-sex marriage or abortion \(3.3, 3.4\). Our election studies demonstrated, however, that more unionist *voters* favoured legalization than opposed \(3.2, 3.5\) with age a more important variable than ideology.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Impacts have been achieved via 1\) changing the rules of the Northern Ireland Executive on the employment of ex\-paramilitary prisoners 2\) data provision to the British and Irish governments, select committees and parties on restoring devolved power\-sharing; 3\) influencing decisions taken by political parties via data from our party membership and election surveys and 4\) impact via parliamentary bodies, the Labour Party and media on knowledge, scrutiny and debate **.** 

 1: On the employment of individuals holding conflict\-related convictions 

 Research on former paramilitary prisoners led to Shirlow’s appointment by the Northern Ireland Executive as Chair of the Review Panel \( [www.reviewpanel.org](http://www.reviewpanel.org/)\) evaluating structural and legal barriers to employment for persons with conflict\-related convictions. 

 Shirlow’s recommendations to amend the 1998 Fair Employment Treatment Order \(FETO\) Section 2 \(4\) ensured any conviction for a pre\-Good Friday Agreement conflict\-related offence would no longer be considered unless directly relevant to the employment sought. His proposals were endorsed in The Fresh Start Panel report on the Disbandment of Paramilitary Groups in Northern Ireland, \(5.1a; see paras. 4.25, 26, 27 and section B2 of the report\) chaired by Lord Alderdice and then supported by the Northern Ireland Executive, which agreed to “urgently adopt recommendations by the Review Panel” that a\) the FETO be amended b\) that this guidance be implemented for public sector recruitment and vetting and c\) there should be greater transparency over all these issues \(5.1b; section B1 of the report\). 

 The impact of Shirlow’s research was that the Executive directed the Northern Ireland Civil Service \(NICS\) to amend the FETO, which had until this point permitted the vetting of individuals and their families who had approved or accepted the use of violence for political ends. This means such persons will have the same employment protection as other citizens. The Executive reiterated its commitment to FETO legislative change in 2021, having implemented the Guidance Principles in 2018 following Shirlow’s proposals and amended NICS recruitment policy. 

 As the Deputy First Minister stated, ‘Professor Shirlow produced a report that had a significant impact upon conflict transformation initiatives and policy\-making within the Executive. Notably it was adopted within the Fresh Start Panel report on the Disbandment of Paramilitary Groups… These recommendations were adopted in the Executive Action Plan in July 2016 and provide the basis for legislative change’ \(5.2a\). The Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service \(NICS\), Sir Malcolm McKibbin, \(5.2b\) confirmed: “Professor Shirlow has…effected change in terms of revisions to the Northern Ireland Civil Service recruitment policy and proposed legislative change to the Fair Employment and Treatment Order 1998…These developments are highly significant as they will reduce barriers to employment and enhance reintegration of people with conflict\-related convictions…important impacts that continue to develop societal relations…” 

 The Finance Minister \(5.2c\) directed the NICS to adopt the Guidance Principles, acknowledging the “helpful input that Professor Shirlow has had both to the implementation of the guidance into Civil Service Policy and Procedures and to assisting the process of conflict transformation by enabling those with conflict related convictions to gain access to employment opportunities *”.* 

 2:  On the restoration of devolved power\-sharing 

 The election data findings informed recommendations to the British and Irish governments and the Northern Ireland Select Committee that a\) restoration of the devolved Assembly and Executive continued to command public support b\) direct rule from Westminster had negligible support c\) devolution was restorable with modest institutional rule changes d\) parties opposing same\-sex marriage and abortion did not represent most of their voters, so Westminster could legalize pre\-devolution’s return but e\) Irish Language provision needed compromise given unionist opposition. 

 Shirlow was invited by the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Office to present research to help solve tensions over identity and social rights, advancing a framework based upon cultural value that was accepted as part of future government policy in Northern Ireland. The British\-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat \(5.3\) declared the research “fed into the preparation of new proposals…to restore the NI Executive and Assembly” …The impact…was to re\-frame the promotion of cultural value into present reconciliatory policies as a means of reducing antagonistic cultural expressions. A further impact of this work was the capacity it provided for a better understanding that parity of esteem and mutual respect does not simply require a rights or horizontal fix but requires building better governance.” The paper “aided our understanding that many of the social issues that are read as dividing the two main communities are in fact better understood as issues divided along inter\-generational lines” \(5.3\). 

 Our data showed how the public had NOT lost faith in devolution despite regular Executive and Assembly crises. Tonge’s oral and written evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee \(NIAC\) was cited extensively \(20 times\) in its 2018 Devolution and Democracy in Northern Ireland: Dealing with the Deficit report \(5.4\). The Committee noted our data showing continuing cross\-community support for devolved power\-sharing and its rules as reason for continuing to press for restoration, concurring with our evidence that the problems were more short\-term issues than those of institutional design \(see 5.4: e.g. pp.53\-54 of NIAC report\). Tonge advised the NIAC that the Assembly should remain for scrutiny roles \(5.4, pp.32\-38, NIAC report\) until fully reinstated \(the Assembly was restored in Jan 2020\). 

 The NIAC endorsed these recommendations for a holding scrutiny role whilst the Assembly was suspended, its report stating: “We recommend that the Secretary of State take legal and procedural advice … on how the committee system in Stormont could be reinstated to provide, at a minimum, a scrutiny function for locally elected MLAs” \(5.4, p.37\). The NIAC also cited Tonge’s opposition to transferring Assembly powers to councils, highlighting his view that “there may be 11 mini\-Stormonts with the same rows just transferred to local level” \(5.4, p.42, NIAC report\). 

 3: On decisions taken by political parties 

 The impact of membership surveys on political parties upon party strategies and composition is acknowledged in testimonials from the leaders of Northern Ireland’s main unionist parties, the DUP and UUP \(5.5a&b\). The surveys detailed each party’s \(lack of\) representativeness. The UUP leader acknowledged “the ‘uncomfortable reading’ could actually provide very clear challenges… the research has proven exceptionally useful in terms of identifying the occupational, gender and denominational make\-up of the party. It was also revealing to learn of the membership attitudes to cultural issues; social issues, political institutions and other political parties” \(5.5b\). 

 One impact was abandonment of UUP merger talks with the DUP. Three sets of merger talks between the DUP and UUP were held between 2010\-17 but our survey data showed only 15% of UUP members supported merger. The UUP leader stated \(5.5b\) “A benefit of the research is the confirmation, from the party membership, that there is no appetite for a merger with the DUP”. 

 The DUP leader’s testimonial states “as a party, we have benefited greatly from the research. The party leadership was fully briefed on the entire data findings, which have been used to help shape party strategy in a wide range of areas. These include the composition and roles of the membership, the roles of women, key party messages; the attraction of votes from within and beyond the unionist community; relationships with other political parties and inter\-community relations” \(5.5a *\)*. One such benefit was the establishment of a 1928 Women’s Committee to attract more women to the DUP and increase their candidacy. The membership survey showed women formed only 27% of the party and female election candidacy was lower, at 9% \(it rose over the next 5 years to 25% at the elections contested by the party in 2019\). The DUP Policy Director has used our election surveys to shape agendas, declaring that they “impacted significantly upon our party in understanding who votes DUP and why … highlighted the most important issues we need to address; and helped us tailor policy development and key election messages” \(5.5d\). 

 Our election survey data has influenced Sinn Féin’s approach to unionist identities, the need for reconciliation and anti\-sectarian strategies. Sinn Féin’s President, Mary Lou McDonald, commented: “The role of Prof. Shirlow has been invaluable in this process. He…presented his research and understanding of the Unionist community at our Ard Fheis…Prof. Shirlow has facilitated a number of informative exchanges between our party and members of the Unionist community. Prof. Shirlow led a series of inter\-community talks between unionists and Sinn Féin members…critical to sharing inter\-community perspectives and understanding of diversity within the unionist community...The impact of Prof. Shirlow’s work has been to shape an environment within which attitudes and opinions can be shared and openly debated” \(5.6a\). Sinn Féin’s leader in Seanad Éireann, Rose Conway\-Walsh \(now elected TD\) stated: “the research clearly demonstrates that many of the assumptions held by me and my colleagues regarding the Unionist population in the North are inaccurate…This was particularly evident in relation to attitudes to social issues. The importance of this evidence is that it demonstrates the cultural complexity of the North/NI and enables us…to frame strategies and provide transformational leadership” \(5.6b\). 

  

 4: Impacts on knowledge/understanding, scrutiny and public debate 

 Our dissemination of research to parliamentary bodies has helped improve understanding and scrutiny of Brexit’s political implications for Northern Ireland. Tonge was commissioned by the European Parliament \(EP\) Constitutional Affairs Committee to provide the first written and oral briefings on The Impact and Consequences of Brexit for Northern Ireland, praised as “excellent” and “significant” by the Committee Chair and a “resounding success” by the EP Directorate for Citizens Rights \(5.7\). Tonge’s oral and written evidence to the House of Lords EU Committee was cited in its 2017 report \(5.8\): “Professor Tonge told us: 89% of nationalists voted to remain, against only 35% of unionists. So, the binary divide is being reinforced in Northern Ireland by Brexit.” \(para.39, p.13\). The Committee urged that government “take account of the interests of the nationalist community to maintain its confidence” \(para: 6, p.75\) whilst concurring with Tonge that “special status is a politically contentious term in Northern Ireland”, to be avoided \(para 9, p.73\). 

 Tonge was requested by the Labour Party to write a Good Friday Agreement training programme for its members, explaining the significance of the deal and showing how our survey data indicates continuing support for its institutions and principles. The Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland commented that “his in\-depth knowledge and expertise have been pivotal…His insightful input has enabled us to develop a robust and easy\-to\-understand political education programme for all Labour Party members, ranging from MPs to party staff to local CLPs and activists” \(5.9\). 

 Our research also rectified knowledge deficits by informing the public how Northern Ireland votes and why, who joins its parties, whether the region’s divisions are thawing and how. The data has been used by a vast range of media outlets, including BBC Newsnight, BBC News, Radio 4’s PM, Today and Westminster Hour, Sky News, ABC, Observer, Guardian, Daily Telegraph, Irish Times, Washington Post, New York Times and Foreign Policy. 5.9 lists some of the hundreds of items. As an example of how our research informed the public, Newsnight \(5.10, with link\) used our election and DUP survey data to a\) show most voters backed legalising same\-sex marriage b\) quantify to a national audience the degree to which religious faith informs DUP members c\) demonstrate how DUP voters are different from party members in religiosity and social attitudes. These findings showed for the first time majority support for same\-sex marriage even among DUP voters. The Guardian *’s* use of our findings \(5.10, with link\) showed how the social conservatism of political parties alienated young people in Northern Ireland, only 1 in 3 18\-24 year olds voting. The research informed Tonge’s consultant role for a 7\-part BBC explainer series on N. Ireland. 

 An editorial \(5.10\) in Northern Ireland’s largest\-circulation newspaper, the Belfast Telegraph, declared: Professor Tonge “has made a valuable contribution to the debate on the social, cultural and political situation in Northern Ireland” *.* The editor asserted \(5.10\): “Professor Tonge has become a key part of the political offering in the Belfast Telegraph…Drawing upon his extensive research, which includes definitive membership studies on the DUP and UUP, he delivers unrivalled critical insight into the often opaque and complex world of Northern Ireland politics. His writing adds further intellectual heft to our reportage and frequently sets the agenda for debate here. Our readers undoubtedly seek out his expert views”.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research from Oxford Physics established the concept of a ‘global carbon budget’, a limited cumulative amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can be emitted before global average temperatures rise above a target threshold such as 2°C relative to pre\-industrial temperatures, by demonstrating that the relationship between temperature and cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is better constrained by observable quantities than earlier policy targets such as stabilisation of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Budgets to limit warming to 2°C and 1.5°C, developed and refined by Oxford Physics research, were very influential in key reports such as the IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report, and IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C. These documents have gone on to inspire huge and wide\-reaching change in climate policy, including Article 4 of the 2015 Paris Agreement which recognises the need for net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the 2019 UK legislation and the 2020 EU Climate Law, both setting targets of net zero emissions by 2050, and China’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2060.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 For 20 years prior to the late 2000s, the stated goal of global climate policy was “stabilisation of greenhouse\-gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system”. Establishing what that level was proved challenging because, as Oxford Physics research demonstrated, it was possible to generate plausible climate models that displayed 2 to 3 times the best\-estimate equilibrium warming for any given stabilisation CO<sub>2</sub> concentration \[1\] \(high levels of equilibrium warming continue to be displayed by the latest generation of coupled models in 2020\). An additional challenge was that these high\-response models could not straightforwardly be ruled out by observations, because of the non\-linear relationship between long\-term equilibrium warming and quantities that can be observed \[2\]. 

 In 2005, Oxford Physicists proposed an alternative framing to this ubiquitous “stabilisation scenario”, focussing on non\-equilibrium peak warming under a scenario in which atmospheric concentrations peak and decline, noting that this is much more directly constrained by observations than the equilibrium warming \[3\]. The hypothesis that this implied a finite carbon budget for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over all time, provisionally estimated at one trillion tonnes of carbon to limit warming to 2°C, was presented using an idealized carbon cycle model at the international workshop “Stabilisation 2005” \(the significance of this finding was immediately recognised by the then Government Chief Scientist, Sir David King, in his keynote address\) and confirmed using a range of models and approaches in a series of papers published in 2009, including \[4\], several initiated by the 2005 workshop. Ref. \[4\], led by Oxford Physics, introduced the now\-famous ‘trillionth tonne’ concept: they demonstrated that the risk of dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system is primarily determined by the total carbon dioxide emissions accumulated over time, not by emissions in any given year or commitment period, implying a need for net zero carbon dioxide emissions to stop global warming. 

 An accurate determination of the carbon budget for various levels of warming was a crucial part of the 2014 IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report \(AR5\). Oxford Physics was involved in work led by the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, with collaborators from Concordia University, that provided quantitative estimates \[5\]. The AR5’s all\-time budget for 2°C of CO<sub>2</sub>\-induced warming ended up very close to that in \[4\], confirming the robustness of the approach. 

 A strength of the AR5 carbon budgets for CO<sub>2</sub>\-induced warming was that they were scenario\-independent and supported by both observations and models. In 2015, the Paris Agreement called upon the scientific community to assess scenarios limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre\-industrial levels. AR5 had provided a carbon budget for 1.5°C that attempted to account for other climate warming agents, but it was based solely on models. Research led from Oxford demonstrated that the current level and rate of human\-induced warming determined outstanding carbon budgets under such ambitious climate goals \[6\]. This research included an analysis and figure that directly anticipated the key opening figure \(SPM.1\) of the Summary for Policymakers of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C which demonstrated transparently that achieving net zero carbon dioxide emissions around 2050 would be necessary to limit warming to 1.5°C, a finding repeatedly cited in national legislation and corporate decisions since then in support of net zero 2050 goals.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Pathway to impact: the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Paris Agreement and IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C**. Myles Allen was a lead author on Chapter 10 “Detection and Attribution of Climate Change: from Global to Regional” and contributing author on Chapter 12 “Long\-Term Climate Change: Projections, commitments and Irreversibility” of the <ins>IPCC Working Group 1 Fifth Assessment Report \(AR5\)</ins>. The report contains more than 130 citations to his work \(27 citations where he is lead author\), citing 31 of his publications \(7 as lead author\), including **\[1\]**\- **\[5\]**. He was also part of the core writing team of the IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report, which distils and integrates the findings of the three working group reports. One of the key reported findings \(E.8\) of the IPCC WG1 AR5 arises directly from the research described here. The findings of this and the other two Working Group reports are summarised in the 2014 Synthesis Report, which notes that “ *Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Limiting risks across \[reasons for concern\] would imply a limit for cumulative emissions of CO2. Such a limit would require that global **net** emissions of CO2 eventually decrease to **zero** and would constrain annual emissions over the next few decades \(Figure SPM.10\) \(high confidence\)”*  **\[A\].** 

 The IPCC AR5 was a critical scientific input to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\) <ins>2015 Paris Agreement</ins>, which put in place an agreement on how the 194 signatory nations would deal with the mitigation of global warming, with a pledge to hold “ *the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre\-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C*” by “ *\[achieving\] a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century*” **\[B\].** In associated decisions, the UNFCCC also invited the IPCC to produce a special report “ *on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre\-industrial levels and related greenhouse gas emission pathways*”. 

 Myles Allen had a key role in the resulting <ins>IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C \(SR1.5\)</ins>: he was coordinating lead author on Chapter 1 “Framing and Context”, a contributing author on Chapter 3 “Impacts of 1.5°C Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems”, and a drafting author on the Summary for Policymakers. The report includes 54 references to his work \(11 where he is lead author\), citing 13 of his papers \(4 as lead author\), including **\[4\]**, **\[5\]** and **\[6\]**. The first key figure in the Summary for Policymakers **\[C\]** \(page 6\) derived directly from **\[6\]** \(figure 1\). The report was released in 2018, with the key finding that limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C is possible but would require “ *deep emissions reductions*” and “ *rapid, far\-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.*” Notably, the SR1.5 also concluded \(A.2.2 on Page 5\) that “ *Reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and declining net non\-CO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing would halt anthropogenic global warming on multi\-decadal time scales \(high confidence\). The maximum temperature reached is then determined by cumulative net global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions up to the time of net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions \(high confidence\) and the level of non\-CO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing in the decades prior to the time that maximum temperatures are reached \(medium confidence\).*” This conclusion can be traced directly to those 2009 papers, including **\[4\]**, and subsequent research. 

###  Changes to climate policies and laws across the world 

 London\-based think\-tank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit supports journalists, parliamentarians and other communicators with accurate and accessible briefings on key climate issues, and provides up\-to\-date tracking of global net zero ambitions under the supervision of an Advisory Board comprising MPs, other public figures and leading academics \(all independent of Oxford Physics\). Their annual “Countdown to Net Zero” report from June 2019 directly credits Oxford Physics research **\[2,3,4\]** as the initiator of scientific advocacy for climate targets based on carbon budgets and net zero emissions, rather than stabilising atmospheric concentrations and emission rates at a certain non\-zero level. As of June 2020, they estimate that the nations, states and cities that have set, or intend to set, net zero targets by 2050 account for: 53% of the global economy; 23% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; 2,600,000,000 people **\[D\].** At the time of writing 6 countries have passed legislation to commit to net zero by 2050, with a further 5 \(and the EU\) proposing legislation. The link between the research presented above and these changes is explored for three countries below; it is noted that it is very likely that the others were also influenced in similar ways. 

 **Sweden**: In June 2017, Sweden’s Parliament decided by a large political majority to introduce a climate policy framework with a climate act for Sweden – “ *the most important climate reform in Sweden’s history \[that\] sets out implementation of the Paris Agreement in Sweden. By 2045, Sweden is to have zero net emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.*” **\[E\]** This was based on the commissioned \(directive 2014:165\) recommendations of the Cross\-Party Committee on Environmental Objectives, whose reports extensively cite IPCC AR5, and specifically the trillion tonne carbon budget for limiting warming to 2°C, which arises from **\[2\]**, **\[3\]** and **\[4\] \[E\]**. The previous “Integrated Climate and Energy Policy” \(passed 2009\) targeted a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to 1990 levels by 2020 but did not commit to net zero emissions \(although this was mentioned as a “vision for Sweden” by 2050\). 

 **UK**: In October 2018, in response to publication of the IPCC SR1.5, the UK government asked the independent advisory group the Committee on Climate Change \(CCC\) to produce a report on whether further action was needed to meet the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement. In May 2019 the CCC produced “Net Zero – The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming” **\[F\]** which “ *recommends a new emissions target for the UK: net\-zero greenhouse gases by 2050… \[this\] emerges clearly from the extensive evidence presented here… including last year’s IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C*” \(the report also cites further work by Myles Allen\). These recommendations were accepted in June 2019, and the “Government response to the CCC” states “ *the overall 2050 target in the Climate Change Act was raised from an 80% reduction from 1990 levels to a net zero emissions target following advice from the CCC*” **\[F\].** 

 **New Zealand**: In May 2019 the New Zealand Government introduced the Zero Carbon Bill as an amendment to the Climate Change Response Act 2002 \(which did not set specific emissions targets\), which was signed into law on 13/11/19, and states that all greenhouse gases \(except biogenic methane\) must fall to net zero emissions by 2050. The Summary **\[G\]** cites **\[C\]** as follows “ *The 2018 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) concluded that in scenarios consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as set out in the Paris Agreement, with limited or no overshoot: global emissions of carbon dioxide \(CO2\) reduce to net zero around 2050…*”, a claim supported directly in **\[C\]** by **\[6\]** and building on all other cited work. 

###  Changes to climate policies of commercial organisations 

 In February 2020, BP announced ambitious plans to reach net zero levels of greenhouse gas emissions from both its operations worldwide and the carbon in the oil and gas it produces, a total of around 415 MteCO<sub>2</sub>e per year at present. Their 2019 Annual Report details 10 aims “ *consistent with the Paris goals*” to help achieve net zero for BP and the world, reached after “ *the board and executive team consider\[ed\] risks and opportunities associated with climate change and the energy transition informed by a range of external inputs, including the IPCC*”. **\[H\]** 

 The UNFCCC’s Race to Zero campaign comprises 454 cities, 23 regions, 1,397 businesses, 74 major investors, and 569 universities committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the latest, explicitly building on the goals of the Paris Agreement. Criteria for joining and monitoring progress on this “Race to Zero” were developed by the UN Climate Ambition Alliance with the University of Oxford in recognition of the University’s track record in establishing the science and policies underlying the net zero goal. **\[I\]** 

 Further examples of corporations setting 2050 net zero targets include Repsol \(the first oil & gas company to set a net zero target including products sold\), Amazon \(mentioning the Paris Agreement explicitly in their decision\), Ikea, Delta Airlines, Google, Microsoft, International Airlines Group \(IAG\), EasyJet, AstraZeneca, Sky and John Lewis Partnership. All mention the United Nations \(Paris Agreement\) and/or the IPCC \(many specifically citing SR1.5\) in announcements or justification of these targets to investors and customers. In recognition of the cumulative impact of carbon dioxide emissions on climate, Google and Microsoft have both committed to include their historical emissions in their net zero targets. 

###  Consequences of updated climate policies and laws in the UK 

 Court challenges to the expansion of Heathrow: in February, 2020, the UK Court of Appeal found that the government had failed to take climate targets adequately into account in the decision to allow the building of a 3<sup>rd</sup> runway at Heathrow, stating “The Paris Agreement ought to have been taken into account by the Secretary of State in the preparation of the ANPS \[Airports National Policy Statement\], but was not,” and the Government declined to appeal the ruling **\[J\].** In December, 2020, the UK Supreme Court ruled explicitly that the ANPS was consistent with UK climate policy in response to the Paris Agreement at the time it was approved \(2018\) which was prior to the publication of SR1.5 and the UK’s subsequent adoption of a binding net zero 2050 goal in 2019, stating “It was not irrational to decide not to attempt to assess post\-2050 emissions by reference to future policies which had yet to be formulated”, referring to the Government’s 2019 Net Zero legislation. Hence the decision in 2019 to enhance the ambition of UK climate policy from an 80% reduction of emissions relative to 1990 by 2050 to 100% was explicitly recognised by the Supreme Court to be of direct relevance to the decision on whether to approve the Heathrow 3<sup>rd</sup> runway, a finding that is likely to be cited in subsequent appeals to the European Court of Human Rights. 

 The UK Government’s 10\-point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution **\[K\]** published in December 2020 brings forward the date of banning internal combustion engines in private cars to 2030 and commits to a target of 10,000,000t per year of CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage by 2030, both targets directly motivated by the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. 

###  Informing public debate 

 The IPCC AR5 received extensive coverage in the media, with many major news sources making explicit references to the trillionth tonne concept **\[L\]**. A key consequence of the existence of a limited global carbon budget is the possibility that a significant fraction of proven reserves of oil, gas and coal may be “unburnable carbon” in the absence of unprecedented development of carbon capture and sequestration.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Fiona Woollard’s research on the ethics of infant feeding has reached mothers, health professionals, infant feeding support volunteers and the general public through interactive online resources, professional development/training resources, workshops, and media engagement. It has significantly helped in combating negative feelings about infant feeding decisions that can have serious effects on the wellbeing of vulnerable new mothers and their infants. The research has: 

 1. Provided mothers with a framework to help them feel better about their feeding experiences and be more sensitive and less judgmental towards others. 

 2. Enabled health professionals and infant feeding support volunteers to feel more confident in discussing infant feeding decisions and to be more sensitive to the need for non\-judgmental support. These influential individuals will interact with thousands of women during their careers. 

 3. Helped *Alberta Health Services* \(the largest provincial health authority in Canada\) to develop an inclusive breastfeeding policy.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Woollard’s research on ethical issues surrounding infant feeding began in 2015. This research draws on a wider body of research into the philosophy of pregnancy, birth and early motherhood, and Woollard’s extensive work on deontological distinctions and self\-ownership. 

 Existing sociological research shows that formula feeding is strongly associated with guilt and shame. At the same time, women who want to breastfeed face shame, particularly surrounding breastfeeding in public. This can have extremely negative effects on the autonomy and well\-being of sometimes vulnerable mothers and their infants. Woollard’s research shows that this guilt and shame is unwarranted \[ **3.1, 3.2, 3.5**\]. Her research reveals misunderstandings that implicitly influence the way we think about, talk about, and treat, mothers. She explains \(i\) how these misunderstandings contribute to unwarranted guilt and shame, \(ii\) why these feelings persist despite policy changes intended to support all parents in their infant feeding decisions and despite the good intentions of many health workers, and \(iii\) how judgment surrounding the use of infant formula hinders breastfeeding support \[ **3.6**\]. 

 <ins>Central Research Findings</ins> 

 a\) Woollard’s distinction between maternal reasons and maternal duties provides a framework to support and encourage breastfeeding and to argue for institutional support for breastfeeding without legitimising guilt and shame for formula feeders \[ **3.1**, **3.2**, **3.4**, **3.5**\]. Woollard shows that there might be reasons to breastfeed – things that speak in its favour – without these reasons generating duties of the kind that make emotions like guilt or blame appropriate. 

 b\) Woollard’s research shows that the moralised context surrounding infant feeding decisions may lead to barriers to providing non\-judgmental support. Her research explains why statements that are simply intended to convey information may be heard as negative judgments. It also explains how awareness of this phenomenon should influence communication with pregnant women and mothers \[ **3.2**, **3.4**, **3.5**, **3.6**\]. 

 c\) Many defenders of breastfeeding argue that breastfeeding should be positioned as the default method of infant feeding in order to fight stigma and improve support for breastfeeding. However, this may lead to descriptions of formula feeding as “harming” or “risking harm”. As these concepts are normatively loaded, this can have serious negative effects on mothers who use formula. Moreover, the descriptive facts do not warrant positioning breastfeeding as the default because the application of defaults is problematic in the context of infant feeding. For both practical and theoretical reasons, we should avoid positioning either feeding method as the default \[ **3.3**\]. 

 d\) Woollard argues that the right to breastfeed can be derived from the right to family life. Moreover, given that women have a right to take part in public life, these rights ground a right to breastfeed in public whether or not one is able to do so discreetly. Current public discourse about infant feeding does not adequately recognise this right \[ **3.5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1 Direct impact on mothers** 

 Negative feelings about infant feeding decisions can have serious effects on the wellbeing of vulnerable mothers and their infants. Mothers have engaged with the research both \(4.1.1\) online and \(4.1.2\) face\-to\-face – each is explained, in turn, below. In general, feedback shows that engaging with the research in these ways helped mothers feel better about their feeding experiences, through helping them to articulate and understand their own experiences and to feel less alone. Feedback also shows that mothers felt it would help them to be more sensitive / less judgmental towards others \[ **5.1**, **5.4**\]. Woollard has also received informal feedback indicating a significant personal impact. One mother emailed: “I had a terrible time with breastfeeding last year and it took a huge emotional toll on me, I think largely due to the kinds of assumptions about maternal obligations that are so pervasive in the media, not to mention the NHS… I've had a hard time articulating all of my thoughts and frustrations about this issue, but your article has been a great help.” \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **4.1.1** **Field\-tested interactive online resources: Feeling Good About How We Feed Our Babies** \(www.feelingsaboutfeedingbabies.co.uk\). 

 Woollard led a team of researchers from the University of Southampton, the University of Cardiff and representatives from the National Childbirth Trust \(NCT\) and Breastfeeding Network \(BFN\) to produce online materials to be used by NCT and BFN practitioners, lactation consultants, midwives, health visitors and mothers to explore feelings surrounding infant feeding. The aim of the resource was to tackle common unhelpful ways of talking and thinking about parents’ choices about how they feed their babies. It also proposes an alternative framework for thinking and talking about the issue to encourage supportive conversations. The NCT and the BFN are key players on this topic: The NCT is the largest charity for parents in the UK, reaching over 100,000 parents in person each year and over 3 million online, whereas the BFN oversee 800 trained infant feeding support volunteers who help families in the UK with infant feeding. 

 The resource combines Woollard’s ethics research and Heather Trickey’s \(Cardiff/NCT\) social science research, with testimonials from mothers and interactive activities. As project manager, Woollard led the development of this resource. With support from Trickey and psychologists at the University of Southampton, she presented her research to focus groups \(April/May 2017\), produced text for the resource, and incorporated feedback from Phyll Buchanan \(founder member and Director, BFN\), Sarah McMullen \(Head of Knowledge, NCT\), Shereen Fischer \(CEO BFN\) and others within the infant feeding community. The resulting prototype was tested through an online survey \(December 2018 – January 2019\), and Woollard made further changes as a result. 

 The feedback from the prototype study showed that over 80% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the resource was personally useful and 70% agreed or strongly agreed that they will make use of the ideas introduced in their personal life. User comments included “Finally someone understands”, “\[It helped me to\] stop feeling guilt and shame”, and “\[I\] feel positive about this kind of resources \[sic\] that help to change the narrative of guilt and shame against mothers and certainly will make a difference to our already stressful journey.” \[ **5.1**\]. These evaluations can be extrapolated to indicate the impact of the final version of the website. 

 The final version of the website was launched in Westminster, at the invitation of Alison Thewliss, MP, at the *All Party Parliamentary Group on Infant Feeding and Inequality* in May 2019. This group is composed of cross\-party MPs and a wide range of key stakeholders in infant feeding. The website was also featured on the parenting forum *netmums* \[see **5.4** for link\]. As of 15<sup>th</sup> December 2020, there have been over 17,605 unique visits to the website \[5.13\]. In feedback taken between 30<sup>th</sup> May 2019 and 30<sup>th</sup> May 2020, 77% of responses rated the site 5 out of 5, or ‘very, very helpful’ \[ **5.10**\]. This suggests that the impact on individuals interacting with the website is comparable to those recorded during the study of the prototype. 

 **4.1.2 Workshops and activities for mothers and Local, National and International Media** 

 Woollard, with other colleagues at the University of Southampton, ran several events aimed either at mothers, or at the public with a focus on mothers: three in\-person workshops had a talk on the research followed by general discussion; over four university outreach festivals, she ran activities involving craft and informal discussions of the research \(twice in person, once online\), delivered an online animation and chat and ran two online panel discussions with Q&A. Over 500 people were reached at these events. Feedback from these events showed that mothers feel that the research helped them to be more sensitive and less judgmental about others’ feeding decisions \[ **5.4**\]. These events also helped Woollard to develop an understanding of how mothers found the research useful, and thereby to develop the online resources above. Woollard also wrote articles and blogs aimed at a general audience for *The Independent*; *Psyche*; and the *Journal of Medical Ethics*. She was interviewed about her work for the BBC Radio 3 *Arts and Ideas* Series; *3CR 855AM* Radio in Melbourne, on *TalkSolent* \(television\) and the *Imperfect Cognition* blog. Her work was discussed in the *Huffington Post* and the *UNICEF* blog \[ **5.4**\]. 

 **4.2 Impact on health professionals and infant feeding support volunteers** 

 The focus group data and interactions with health professionals and infant feeding support volunteers at workshops and conferences showed that many were worried about how to talk to mothers about infant feeding decisions. Significant numbers of these practitioners were also reached through both \(4.2.1\) a series of engagement events and \(4.2.2\) formal training resources – each is explained, in turn, below. These groups reported that engaging with the research helped them to be more sensitive to the need for non\-judgmental support \[ **5.2**, **5.4**\]. Phyll Buchanan \(founder member and Director, BFN\) summarised the impact of Woollard’s research on practitioners: “You’ve given us a framework and words for looking more objectively at the influences on infant feeding decisions and the tensions within. Once parents have words to express their feelings it takes the weight off their internal struggles. It can’t solve the dilemma, what it does do is reduce the guilt and shame. That is invaluable.” \[ **5.6**\]. 

 Each of these influential individuals will interact with thousands of women during their career \(e.g. a health visitor’s recommended caseload is 250 children at any time\). This means that changing the actions and attitudes of these groups is likely to have an extremely wide positive impact on mothers by increasing the number of mothers who receive non\-judgmental support. 

 **4.2.1 Face\-to\-face and online workshops and activities** 

 The research was presented and discussed at 7 events that Woollard \(co\-\)organised bringing together midwives, trainee midwives, GPs, health visitors, NCT practitioners, BFN practitioners, policy makers, and academics. Approximately 200 delegates participated in six workshops in Southampton and London, and a seventh workshop hosted online attracted 1,043 unique visitors and 2,188 page views. Woollard was also invited to present her research at many events including the BFN Annual Conference 2016 \(to an audience including over 100 BFN counsellors\), the European Neonatal Ethics Conference 2019 \(to an audience including an estimated 150 neonatal healthcare practitioners\), the Western Sydney University Infant Feeding Group Seminar \(roughly 15 academics who are also practising midwives, nurses, and infant feeding support volunteers\) \[ **5.4**\]. In total, these workshops and activities reached an estimated 684 people in face\-to\-face settings and over 1,000 online. 

 Feedback was gathered from a sample of these events. In each case, a high percentage of respondents indicated that they were likely to use the research in their personal or professional lives: *Breastfeeding Dilemma* 80%; *Breastfeeding and Ethics* 75%; *Taking Pregnancy Seriously* 77%. Participants commented: “This will inform my tutoring and supervision.” \(BFN Tutor/Supervisor\); “As a student midwife I hope to use this broadening of thought to facilitate my understanding/ empathy when working with individual women that I encounter during my hospital placement”; ""What was shared by Fiona will inform my own personal approach and ‘internal attitude’ as I support women.” \[ **5.4**\]. One NCT practitioner and tutor, who attended multiple workshops over a period of several years, said: “Fiona’s work on moral duties and breastfeeding opened up ways of looking at the subject, and brought a new language to use when working with parents and my own students” \[ **5.8**\]. 

 **4.2.2 Contributions to accredited professional development resources and training resources** 

 In February 2020, Woollard was contacted by *Gold Lactation* \- a virtual education provider for Nurses, Midwives, Doulas, Lactation Consultants and other health care workers who provide care to women, infants and families \- asking her to contribute to an international accredited online professional development module for lactation professionals, and as a result they launched a presentation by Woollard in June 2018 \[ **3.6**\]. The presentation focused on how the moralised context surrounding infant feeding can hinder attempts to provide non\-judgmental support and how awareness of this phenomenon should influence communication with pregnant women and mothers.  In feedback from the initial cohort of participants, 98% agreed or strongly agreed that “the information presented at this activity was pertinent to my professional needs”, while 90% agreed that “The content of this activity contributes valuable information that will assist me in improving patient outcomes.” One commented “Very helpful, balancing the need to give information with the desire not to make someone feel guilty has been a constant struggle for me and I have been a lactation consultant for 15 years.” \[ **5.2**\]. *Gold Lactation* also chose Woollard’s presentation to be translated into Mandarin as part of a package of training materials selected to be made available to lactation consultants in China. As of April 2020, this presentation has been part of the accredited professional development of 928 lactation consultants in English and around 100 in Mandarin \[ **5.7**\]. 

 Phyll Buchanan \(founder member and Director, BFN\) used Woollard’s research to revise the BFN’s training activity for Neonatal Unit helpers, “Exploring Attitudes to Infant Feeding” to include discussion of the perceived need to justify infant feeding decisions. This training will be given to around 100 volunteers a year, who collectively help many new parents. Sarah Edwards, the BFN Training manager, estimated that they would also use the exercise in training approximately 50 people per year in the community, as the exercise is also part of the BFN’s school lesson plans and the First Milk Matters training and she intended to include the updated version in those places as well \[ **5.6**\]. 

 The *Feeling Good About Feeding Babies* website \(4.1.1, above\) was also welcomed by health professionals and infant feeding support volunteers as a useful training resource. Woollard and Trickey were asked to write articles on the website for the BFN newsletter, and *Infant: the journal for neonatal and paediatric healthcare professionals –* the most read UK publication on this topic. The BFN also ran a webinar for BFN and NCT practitioners discussing the website and how it might feed into practice. BFN CEO, Shereen Fisher, commented: “we think that the Feeling Good website will be a very useful resource for our peer supporters because it helps deepen their understanding of women’s experiences and makes us more aware of the issues that influence infant feeding decisions” \[ **5.9**\]. As of 15<sup>th</sup> December 2020, there have been over 17,605 unique visits to the website \[5.13\]. 

 Woollard’s research formed the basis of two activities in an online *20 hour Breastfeeding Course* produced by *Alberta Health Services –* the largest health authority in Canada – aimed at all health care professionals in Alberta who work with breastfeeding families, including public health and acute care nurses, physicians, midwives, and other health care professionals \[ **5.3**, **5.12**\]. Alberta Health Services produced the activities after engaging with Woollard’s work \(see details below\) and Woollard helped refine the wording and content. The course launched in August 2020 \[ **5.12; 5.14**\]. 

 **4.3 Development of infant feeding policy** 

 On the basis of her work, *Alberta Health Services* asked Woollard for support in developing their breastfeeding policy. Alberta Health Services are the largest health authority in Canada, delivering health services to around 4.3m people, and 50,000 new mothers per year. In August 2018, a Health Promotion Facilitator at Alberta Health Services contacted Woollard asking for a copy of her research to help them with their provincial breastfeeding policy. This policy issues guidance to all medical professionals in Alberta about breastfeeding, though is used most often by midwives, lactation consultants, and health visitors. Woollard’s work was then shared internally at Alberta Health Services, including with the Early Childhood Manager for their Healthy Children and Families Programme, and this led to Woollard being consulted at length about the policy and how it should be modified in light of the research. Alberta Health Services confirmed via correspondence that Woollard’s research significantly influenced their breastfeeding policy in three key ways \[ **5.3**\]: 

 First, it consolidated their choice of language, moving away from discussing the “benefits” of breastfeeding and the “risks” of using formula to more balanced language that discusses the health benefits, considerations, safety issues and health risks associated with each feeding option. Second, it influenced their decision to avoid positioning breastfeeding as a default option, even though in the past this has been perceived as appropriate and even beneficial. Third, it caused them to explicitly acknowledge, within the policy itself, how difficult it is to support informed feeding decisions in a wider context in which mothers are strongly disposed to feel judged for their choices. 

 Alberta Health Services has also used Woollard’s research in a new worksheet to help parents explore their thoughts, feelings and experiences of infant/child feeding, and to record any questions they have about feeding options \[ **5.11**\]. This form will then be used to guide discussion with their health care provider about infant feeding. Woollard’s research led to the inclusion of an introduction that explicitly clarifies the role of the health service in this context, and is designed to help reset any expectation of judgment of the sort outlined in Woollard’s research \[ **5.3**\]. Alberta planned to launch these in early 2020, but the launch has been delayed due to COVID\-19.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted at SOAS on water law and governance in India shaped the country’s development and review of key water management legislation. With impact at national and state levels, the research shaped and informed national groundwater and framework water legislations, as well as draft acts in \[text removed for publication\] and Madhya Pradesh. The research also influenced media debate and coverage of water issue in India, in international as well as Indian media outlets, thus raising further awareness of this contentious issue whereby a significant percentage of the Indian population is deprived of access to safe and sufficient drinking water.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Water governance has been a contentious issue in India. A significant proportion of the population do not have sufficient access to drinking water for reasons including falling water tables, declining infrastructure, economic factors and social norms. These problems, however, have long been ignored in the drafting of water law, which is concerned primarily with water’s economic potential and the rights of landowners. The unprecedented number of water reforms adopted since the late 1990s have been conceived within a narrow framework, overlooking existing scientific knowledge and new challenges, such as those posed by the increase in groundwater use. 

 Research conducted by Philippe Cullet \(Professor of International and Environmental Law at SOAS from 2002\) has focused on water law and governance, specifically on groundwater, drinking water, sanitation and institutional reforms in India. Cullet has addressed the failure of the conceptual framework informing water law reforms to consider the multiplicity of water uses and functions, especially its human rights, social and environmental dimensions, issues widely explored in his 2009 monograph, *Water Law, Poverty and Development: Water Sector Reforms in India* **\[3.1\]** and an edited volume **\[3.2\]**. Using primary sources and an analysis of legal frameworks and their underpinning ideas, Cullet’s research has proposed broad\-based reforms to water laws at the national level informed by a human rights, equity and sustainability perspective. Such reforms would help to ensure that water laws contribute to the realisation of the human right to water for the poor and marginalised, particularly in rural areas, rather than focussing simply on water’s economic dimension. 

 Similarly, in **\[3.3\]** Cullet examined the on\-going development of Indian case law concerning water, specifically the relationship between water and the environment and control over water. Cullet assessed water sector and law reforms proposing drastic changes to the sector, and outlined the problems posed by the Indian courts’ lack of a unified response. **\[3.4\]** continued to evaluate water laws in India, focusing on drinking water, in particular in rural areas, in terms of the realisation of the human right to water. **\[3.5\]** analysed more generally the different dimensions of the right to water, including issues related to the privatisation of water services and controversies around free water policies. **\[3.6\]** reflected Cullet’s specific work on groundwater where he underlined the deficiencies of the existing legal framework governing groundwater in India \(which is based on nineteenth\-century principles\), asserting that it leads to further deterioration of the resource annually.  With 80% of the country’s drinking water needs derived from groundwater, Cullet argued for the necessity of reforms that ensure a delinking of access to groundwater from land rights, but in such a way as to preclude a more damaging form of privatisation that would adversely affect groundwater users. 

 Cullet’s ground\-breaking research has been the only sustained academic effort to analyse the multi\-pronged reforms taking place in water law in India since the 1990s. The limited expertise on new issues in water law, coupled with Cullet’s novel work, has enabled his work to generate significant impact on water governance and policy making in India.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Prof Cullet’s research fed into the development of key water management legislation in India – both at the national and at the state levels. These included 1\) the 2011 Groundwater Model Bill and its subsequent redrafting in 2015; 2\) the revision commissioned by the Union Government in 2015 of the 2011 \(water\) Framework legislation; and 3\) the \[text removed for publication\] and Madhya Pradesh water legislation draft acts. Cullet was heavily involved in the drafting of all these proposals, which reflected to a large extent the recommendations he made in his research, in particular the introduction of the public trust doctrine to water legislation; the incorporation of the fundamental right to water in statutory instruments, the inclusion of protection principles \(e.g. precautionary principle\), and the introduction of the principle of subsidiarity that came to reinforce existing provisions for decentralisation. The research also influenced media debate and coverage of water issue in India, in Indian as well as international media outlets. 

 Informing groundwater legislation 

 The impact described here builds on earlier policy impact whereby Cullet was invited by the Planning Commission of India \(Government of India\) in 2011 to chair the committee that was tasked with the draft of the Model Bill for the Conservation, Protection and Regulation of Groundwater, 2011. The Groundwater Model Bill, 2011 was highly critical of the inadequacies of the existing legal framework for groundwater and largely reflected Cullet’s research since, as chair, he had a leading input into the framing of the text. Informed by Cullet’s research, the central objectives of the Bill included the need to regulate and control iniquitous groundwater use and distribution; to ensure safe drinking water for all; to regulate groundwater extraction to ensure its sustainability; and to prevent the contamination of groundwater resources **\[5.1\]**.The Groundwater Model Bill was put forward as part of documents for the 12th Five\-Year Plan \(2012–2017\) but there was no particular effort by the Central Government to push it further before the end of Parliament’s term in May 2014. The Government that was elected in the 2014 general election took a number of political and policy initiatives in the water sector. With regard to water legislation, it started by asking 3 members of the Central Ground Water Board \(CGWB\) to assess the Groundwater Model Bill, 2011. Their report made minor suggestions for changes but on the whole entirely endorsed the policy framework and the basic principles proposed in 2011 \(such as recognising the common nature of groundwater and the need to govern it at the most local level possible\), which overwhelmingly reflected Cullet’s research. 

 This positive assessment led the Government of India to set up the ‘Committee to Redraft the Draft Model Bill for Conservation, Protection & Regulation of Ground Water, 2011’ in October 2015 **\[5.2\]**. The Committee was chaired by Dr Mihir Shah who was in charge of all water\-related work in the Planning Commission and who had asked Cullet to convene the 2011 committee to draft the Groundwater Model Bill. He naturally asked Cullet to be part of this new committee who comprised 7 members, out of which 5 had been part of the 2011 committee. The composition of the committee was in itself an endorsement of the work done by Cullet in 2011 **\[5.2 p3\]**. 

 The Committee was tasked to ‘redraft’ the 2011 text **\[5.3\]**. This was based on the comments made in report of the CGWB, as well as additional terms of reference framed by the Government. The work undertaken by the committee between the end of 2015 and mid\-2017 involved reconsidering each principle and provision of the 2011 text. All the basic premises of the text remained untouched and the principles on which the legislation was based were the same. At the same time, addressing the various comments and queries required substantial drafting. As one of only 2 lawyers on the committee and its senior member, Cullet ended up doing a large part of the drafting required. 

 The work of the Committee led to a first draft in 2016 **\[5.4\]**. This was then discussed with senior state\-level bureaucrats \(water is a state subject, hence the model legislation needs to be adopted by individual states\) in early 2017 **\[5.7\]**. The Government then reconvened the Committee to address the comments made by states **\[5.6\]**. Subsequently, the NITI Aayog \(the successor to the Planning Commission of India\) requested a presentation of the new model bill. Following additional comments by the NITI Aayog **\[5.8\]**, a final draft version of the model bill was adopted by the Committee in August 2017 **\[5.9, 5.10\]**. State governments are at liberty to adopt groundwater legislation based on the model bill. Indian states have indeed legislative competence over water – which is also the reason why Parliament would in principle not adopt a groundwater legislation. The first adopted legislation that reflected some of the new thinking enshrined in the 2017 text was the Uttar Pradesh Ground Water \(Management and Regulation\) Act, 2019. It reflected, for instance, the need for a decentralised institutional framework based on the subsidiarity principle and the idea of introducing groundwater security plans. It also included a separate chapter on water pollution, and a chapter on impact assessment and transparency **\[5.13 chs v and vii respectively\]**. Some states moved towards adopting water acts, which also addressed groundwater and with principles that mostly reflected the principles of the model bill. The state of Madhya Pradesh decided in August 2019 to appoint a committee to develop a water strategy for the state, which included the drafting of a provisionally titled Madhya Pradesh Right to Water \(Conservation and Sustainable Use\) Act, 2019. Cullet was asked by the Panchayat and Rural Development Department to join the group/to work with the group **\[5.12\]**. Being the only lawyer involved, he took on a central role in the drafting of this legislation. \[Text removed for publication\]. In the case of the Madhya Pradesh and the \[text removed for publication\] drafts and some parts of the Uttar Pradesh legislation, the structure, basic principles and underlying thinking can be traced directly to the 2011 Model Bill, which in turn reflected Cullet’s research. 

 Shaping the framework water legislation 

 Because of limited developments in law\-making at the state level, the Union Government decided in 2015 that the same committee entrusted with redrafting the 2011 Groundwater Model Bill should in addition draft a new framework water legislation that would provide an umbrella charter of water principles applicable throughout the country – something that special constitutional procedures allow **\[5.3\]**. This provided an opportunity to revisit the work of the Planning Commission of India’s committee drafting a groundwater framework legislation in 2011 \(a group chaired by the late R. Iyer and of which Cullet was a member\) and a subsequent draft by a committee set up by the Ministry of Water Resources in 2013. In the 2000s, a few academics and policy makers, including Cullet and R. Iyer, promoted the idea of a framework legislation arguing that despite water being a state subject, India needed legislation that would bring together all the various water\-related principles developed in particular by the Supreme Court of India and the high courts over time, and which were not reflected in any legislation **\[3.4\]**. This legislation would play the role of an umbrella legislation setting out principles valid throughout the water sector, something that does not exist at present. The Parliament can adopt this legislation through a provision of the Constitution that allows the Centre to legislate on matters reserved for states \(as in the case of water\) if states request Parliament to do so. This legislation would not replace all the existing sectoral legislation \(such as irrigation legislation, or the proposal groundwater legislation discussed above\) but would provide a broad contextual legislation for all other more specific acts. The draft proposed by the Water Resources Ministry adopted in 2016 by the drafting committee **\[5.4\]** integrated different parts of the previous 2 drafts and a lot of new thinking. It received many positive comments when it was submitted to public feedback/assessment, including from corporations such as General Electric \(India\) which congratulated the Ministry ‘for its leadership in promoting conservation and efficient use of water resources in the country’ and stated that it ‘strongly supports Draft Model Bill’ **\[5.5aii p2\]**. Intergovernmental authorities such as the World Health Organisation, and NGOs such as WaterAid India which recognised that the ‘move towards a comprehensive legislation on water is a welcome step’ **\[5.5bii p1\]**.  The draft was often referred to between 2018 and 2020 but had not been formally submitted to Parliament as of 2020. 

 Raising the visibility of water issues in Indian and International media and online debate 

 The dialogue around water legislation Cullet influenced was picked up by media outlets in India. Cullet was asked to contribute several pieces outlining the water crisis faced by the country, including by The Print and The Hindu **\[5.11a and b\]**. The pieces stimulated interest from the general public, as shown by comments. One reader described how ‘\[the\] Article introduce us real situation of water in India. One side water flood and another side that water everywhere but not a drop to drink’; another found that ‘the seriousness of the article is not felt either by public or the policy maker’, citing their own city \(Chennai\) ‘as an example where we are heading for a severe water crisis by irrevocable decisions and lack of attention’ A third reader considered that ‘This article correctly points out to a very urgent and critical issue which seems, as the author says, “invisible” to the public’ **\[all 5.11bii\]**. Cullet was also cited in a number of well\-read Indian and international media outlets addressing the issue and more broadly inequality in India, including Word Finance, Reuters, Hindustan Times and Business Today **\[5.11c–f\]**. The law drafting process Cullet was helping to shape was also covered and scrutinized by the media **\[5.11g–j\]**, thus raising the public awareness on the political and legal debate.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our research showed that adult new speakers of Welsh in non\-Welsh speaking areas are more successful when able to access Welsh\-language social networks via study in Welsh language multi\-purpose centres \(‘ *Canolfannau Cymraeg’*\). Widely publicised via Welsh Assembly Member and stakeholder\-sponsored events, our key finding had a direct influence on Welsh Government policy and its decision to fund 10 new centres. This GBP2,250,000 investment has so far provided an enhanced learning environment for around 100 Welsh for adults classes and contributed in excess of GBP1,300,000 to local economies across Wales. The Welsh experience has also informed language planning in Ireland. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Our research was the first to investigate **the impact of **Canolfannau Cymraeg****Footnote:**

 The term ‘ *Canolfan Gymraeg / Canolfannau Cymraeg*’ is used to refer to a centre where classes for learners are combined with social activities for Welsh speakers in the community as well as various other facilities e.g. cafés or bars. 
**on social networks of new speakers of Welsh** and their potential as drivers for RLS \(Reversing Language Shift\) in predominantly non\-Welsh speaking areas of Wales. Adult Welsh language learning, particularly in those areas of Wales where Welsh is not the main community language, can flounder due to insufficient opportunities to practice and feel part of a Welsh\-language social network. Our research explored the efficacy of *Canolfannau Cymraeg* and other factors involved in improving learning outcomes with the aim of **boosting the number of Welsh speakers** and the **proficiency of Welsh learners** in Wales. 

 In 2009 Swansea University’s 'Welsh for Adults Centre' was successful in winning a GBP35,000 research grant from the Welsh Government following a competitive process. This award endorsed the project investigators’ expertise in language policy research \[see R3, R5\], building upon previous commissioned work for the Welsh Language Board \[R6\] and a previous impact case study on language planning and children presented to REF 2014. 

 Driving the research was the central question of **whether learning in a **Canolfan Gymraeg** improves the availability of social networks to adults**, thereby also increasing fluency and encouraging the cultural embeddedness of learners. Data was provided by one third of all adult learners of Welsh attending advanced level courses. Participants completed questionnaires and took part in focus groups held in strategic locations. In relation to existing opportunities to maintain social networks in Welsh, we discovered that ‘traditional’ Welsh domains only attracted a limited number of participants. \(R1, section 7.4, ‘History of Language Centres/Canolfannau Cymraeg’ lists 8 centres, including *Clwb Brynmenyn* which came to an end in 2003. The history of each centre is different, but most were established by ‘local enthusiasts’, without government funding\). 

 The research compared outcomes for adult learners who had studied in a *Canolfan Gymraeg* and those who had not had this opportunity. Our data showed that amongst learners who go to a *Canolfan Gymraeg*, 43% use Welsh regularly there and 35% use it occasionally. The research highlighted **integrative motivation as the main driver** for adult learners of Welsh \[R1 p.38\]. 

  

 The research also took on an international dimension. After investigating strategies in other language communities that could be adapted to the efforts to integrate adults who have learnt Welsh, we found that the nearest model to the *Canolfannau Cymraeg* is the Euskaltegis in the Basque Country, which had founded approximately 200 centres by 2014 \[R4\]. 

 Our report \[R1\] recommended the development of the *Canolfan Gymraeg* model in order to create a link between new speakers and the rest of the language community, raising their awareness and providing a safe linguistic environment for them. A number of strategies \[R2\] were recommended with a common theme of ensuring that at B1/B2 CEFR**Footnote:**

 CEFR = Common European Framework of Reference for Languages 
level learners have sufficient linguistic resources to be able to communicate in and get access to Welsh\-language social networks. Our research documented the state of current provision \[R1, R4\], and based on the findings, argued the case for establishing new *Canolfannau Cymraeg*, supported by government via a national body, as a “creative and productive” means of “enriching social networks for adult learners of Welsh”.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Influencing Welsh Government Language Policy and Funding** 

 Our research has played a critical role in **influencing the Welsh government's GBP2,250,000 support for creating 10 new Language Centres**. “As a result of Steve Morris’s original research, the Welsh Government has opened 10 Language Centres across Wales... Steve's research made the case to support these types of community hub” \(Welsh Government Deputy Director, Welsh Language Division\) \[C1\]. 

 The **research was supported by then First Minister Carwyn Jones** \[C2\] who announced the creation of new *Canolfannau Cymraeg* to underpin the government's commitment to **promote the use of Welsh,** outlined in the policy statement ‘ *Bwrw Ymlaen*’ \(2014\). The last centre was opened in November 2016, and the Welsh Government has set up a National Board to oversee their development and impact on the various communities. 

 **Language pressure groups** including *Dyfodol i’r Iaith* \[A Future for the Language\] have also recognised the significance of this relationship between language and community, committing in their manifesto to “the creation of a Welsh Centres network across Wales”, as the centres represent “focal points for Welsh\-speaking life in their areas” \[C3 p.15\]. 

 **Economic and Cultural Benefits \(i\): Influence on Local Economies** 

 *Canolfannau Cymraeg* have considerable economic impact in their local areas, and the **total economic impact within South Wales was GBP1,300,000**. 

 The 2015 *Evaluation of the Economic and Cultural Impact of Canolfan Soar* report \[C4\] demonstrated that this well\-established **centre in Merthyr Tydfil was worth approximately GBP608,000 to the local economy over one yea**r, based on “the direct, indirect and subsequent rounds of expenditure induced by the activities by the Centre”. 

 “Through its provision of space for local businesses Canolfan Soar and its tenants are contributing to **developing the local economic infrastructure**. They make a further positive impact by **providing employment** and using a range of local suppliers. The Centre has also become **a community hub** and is host to a cluster of like\-minded businesses which is **promoting knowledge exchange and creative partnerships**” \[C4\]. 

 Comparison of the initial plans, strategies and activities of the new *Canolfannau Cymraeg* \[C5\] and their 2018 end\-of\-grant reports \[C6\] shows their **main economic benefits**: 

-  Cardiff: recruitment/training of 30 volunteers, 200 ‘friends’ of the centre contributing GBP14,000 a year. 

-  Pontardawe: community book shop/resource centre opened. 

-  Bangor: increase in the use of Welsh amongst local businesses through \(i\) greater visual signage \(ii\) confidence\-raising sessions with 25 members of staff. 

-  Carmarthen: 70\+ agencies, businesses and social clubs used the facilities in the first year. 

 **Economic and Cultural Benefits \(ii\): Influence on Use of Welsh** 

 Reports submitted to the Welsh Government by the newly\-established centres \[e.g. C7\] demonstrate that in addition to adult new speakers of Welsh, **beneficiaries include families, children and young people**, thus developing the impact in relation to children and language planning, the focus of our case study in REF 2014 \[R5, R6\]. The creation of the centres has also led to the promotion and strengthening of the language within their wider communities. 

 Our research highlighted integrative motivation as the main driver for adult learners of Welsh \[R1 p.38\]. The new *Canolfannau Cymraeg* provide invaluable opportunities in mainly non\-Welsh\-speaking communities for learners to couple their motivations with **opportunities to use the language** and **integrate in Welsh\-language social networks** which otherwise are not easily accessible. Groups benefit from being able to extend the domains where they use Welsh and by having space to expand and consolidate their social networks in the language. 

 Further academic evaluation of the impact created by the new centres \(2018\) \[C8\] noted **strong support for the **Canolfannau Cymraeg**: 

-  76% of respondents \[ *n* 100\] thought more should be set up; 

-  32% said that the presence of a *Canolfan Gymraeg* had a big effect on their use of Welsh with 46% agreeing it helped increase confidence in speaking the language; 

-  61% of those who did not live close to a centre felt one was needed in their area; 

-  76% believed that the presence of a *Canolfan Gymraeg* had an effect on the use of Welsh in their community. 

 Moreover, our research has **international reach**. As a result of seeing our research turned into funded government policy and the evaluations showing the positive impact on language learning and the integration of new speakers into target language social networks, other minority language communities are considering the *Canolfannau Cymraeg* model for their own Reversing Language Shift planning. 

 The 2016 briefing ‘Building Irish Language Networks and Communities outside the Gaeltacht’ by Professor Colin Williams, a world\-leading authority on language planning \[C9\], highlights that the Welsh Government “backed the idea that safe spaces that were multipurpose could help promote the social use of Welsh”, and frames the *Canolfannau Cymraeg* as a **model to inform future language planning in Irish** outside of its core areas.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Women have been under\-represented in the theatre, in terms of the numbers of female playwrights whose work is staged, the number of main roles for women and the gender bias of the stories told. Professor Zinnie Harris has created 6 plays which put women at the centre of dramatic stories, creating substantial roles for women actors and making a considerable contribution to changes in the gender imbalance ingrained in most theatre. Harris’s work has: 

 **1. increased the representation of plays by and about women in British and international theatre and catalysed changes in theatre practice**. These 6 plays have been translated into French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish and seen by more than 71,000 people in 10 countries at principal theatres – at times, by audiences of record size for the theatre concerned. Their critical and box office success influenced subsequent programming of drama by women and increased roles for women in professional theatre. In 2017, for example, five plays by Harris formed the core of the Edinburgh International Festival drama programme – a featuring of a diverse range of work by a female playwright almost certainly unprecedented in the Festival’s history. In 2019, Glasgow’s Citizens Theatre’s decision to programme an entire season of plays by women was directly inspired by Harris’s work. 

 **2.** **stimulated public debate about women’s roles in theatre** in Britain, Europe, South Africa and Turkey, where Harris’s *Meet Me at Dawn* catalysed debate about women’s representation in drama and inspired ten new plays about gender and LGBT identity. 

 **3. left a creative legacy of 6 award\-winning plays** that influence and inspire contemporary female dramatists. These works have: won the Berwin Lee award for best play in the USA/UK; won the Critics’ Award for Best New Play, Scotland, once and been shortlisted twice; been shortlisted for the Susan Smith Blackburn award; and won a Herald Angel award. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Playwriting for stage, screen and radio has been integral to the School’s creative work, research and teaching for a decade. The creative work of Harris and colleague Oliver Emanuel \(winner of multiple awards for radio and theatre drama\) is complemented by Dr Sam Haddow’s research on theatre and political violence. Since 2014, their teaching and creative work has benefitted from the University’s lease of the Byre Theatre \(directed by former managers/directors of the NTS and Scottish Opera\). 

 Harris’s writing is driven by the question: how do we challenge the representation of women in theatre? British theatre has a wonderful canon of plays but, historically, dramatists have tended to put men at the centre of their stories, leading to a lopsided presentation of the world. Not only are women under\-represented on stage, but also, where women *are* at the centre of modern plays, the story is often restricted to being about something that only concerns women \(‘women’s issues’\). The tradition of ‘everyman’ roles – for instance King Lear and Willy Loman – has few female equivalents. Harris responded by creating plays in which the central woman *is* the everyman character rather than being defined by her gender or romantic relationships. 

 The second catalyst for Harris’s writing concerns the representation of women in ancient and canonical drama. In modern contexts, and with contemporary understandings of grief, ambition, frustration, depression and marriage, the psychology of these characters is often unconvincing; they are simplistically perceived as ‘bad’ or ‘emotional’ women rather than understood as complex and individual. Harris re\-visited these stories and framed them around the woman’s experience, so that the characters’ choices and behaviour arise as much from their situations as from a received representation of the female disposition. The recreation of canonical female roles is a notable focus of Harris’s work, including: the 2016 trilogy *This Restless House* re\-creating Aeschylus’s Clytemnestra and Electra from the *Oresteia* \[R1\] and her 2019 adaptation *The Duchess \[of Malfi\]* from Webster’s source \[R2\]. 

 Six of Harris’s plays with women at the centre have been published by Faber during the assessment period, leaving a legacy of leading roles for women. The first was *How to Hold Your Breath* \[R3; R5\], a response to Brecht’s *The Good Person of Szechwan*. Researched and written during 2012\-14, this was a new morality play that reflected on contemporary refugee crises and placed two women as everyman figures, in contrast to the prostitute and her male alter\-ego in Brecht’s play. Crucially, the women carry a universal story and are not seen in relation to a romantic attachment to a man, but as representative of humankind. 

 The research for and writing of the trilogy *This Restless House* \[R1\], which reworks Aeschylus’s *Oresteia*, took place between 2013 and 2015. Harris placed Clytemnestra at the centre of part one of her trilogy \(equivalent to Aeschylus’s *Agamemnon*\), and then her daughter Electra at the centre of parts 2 and 3 \(rather than the son – Orestes – as in the originals\). Challenging received ideas of Clytemnestra \(and later Electra\) as a woman already capable of murder, Harris showed Clytemnestra affected and changed by the events of the play – not least, grief at the ritual sacrifice of her daughter. 

 The fourth play with women at the centre, *Meet Me at Dawn* \[R4; R5\] \(researched and written between 2015\-2017\), drew inspiration from the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice but was re\-framed as a love story between two women, exploring grief after the sudden death of one of the lovers. In this play, Harris created an original narrative with two women at the centre but where the characters’ sexuality was incidental rather than the main theme of the writing – an almost unprecedented move in modern theatre. 

 In 2018 and 2019, Harris wrote and directed a new adaptation of John Webster’s *The Duchess of Malfi* for the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh. *The Duchess \[of Malfi\]* \[R2\] explores female sexuality, disobedience in the face of controlling men and male rage; Harris’s version uses the themes from the original but also engages equivalent contemporary contexts, including the \#MeToo movement.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Zinnie Harris has created 6 plays \(decribed in section 2\) which put women at the centre of dramatic stories, creating substantial roles for women actors and making a considerable contribution to changes in the gender imbalance ingrained in most theatre. Since 2015, these 6 plays have been seen by more than 71,000 people in 10 countries \(the UK, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden, Turkey and the USA\) and have been translated into 11 languages. They have changed programming practice at two major theatres and festivals, provoked international debate about women’s representation in theatre, and leave a legacy of work that has influenced British, Turkish, Kurdish and Iranian playwriting about women. 

 **1. Harris’s work increased the representation of plays by and about women in British and international theatre and catalysed changes to theatre practice.** 

 \(a\) Increasing the representation of plays by women: All of Harris’s plays received high\-profile premieres at national or leading theatres. These plays about women were viewed by audiences of, at times, exceptional size for the theatres concerned; their critical and box office success prompted further productions, increasing the representation of plays by and about women in the UK and Continental Europe. For example, *How to Hold Your Breath* premiered on the main stage of the  [Royal Court Theatre](https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/how-to-hold-your-breath/), London, for 8 weeks \(48 performances\) from February – April 2015. This production was attended by 19,126 people to a capacity of 98% \(the second highest\-grossing play in the theatre’s history\) \[S1, p.1\]. In 2015, it won the  [Berwin Lee playwriting award](http://berwinlee.org/awards) for best play in the UK/USA. It was then produced in prestigious theatres in France, Turkey, Sweden and Greece: in 2016, the six\-month production at the Diana Theatre, Athens, for example, had over 22,000 people \(attendees\) while the production at Istanbul’s DOT Theatre was attended by nearly 4,000 people \(audience members\), a record for the venue, leading to nominations in 8 of 11 categories in Turkey’s most prestigious theatre awards \[S1, p. 5\]. In January 2017, it opened in the main theatre in  [Gothenburg](https://stadsteatern.goteborg.se/teaterrummet/nummer/var-formenta-trygghet/), Sweden. In 2018, it was produced and broadcast on  [French national radio](https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/fictions-theatre-et-cie/comment-retenir-sa-respiration-de-zinnie-harris-0), read at the  [Comédie\-Française](https://www.comedie-francaise.fr/fr/evenements/bureau-des-lecteurs-juin17-18), Paris \(the world’s oldest theatre company and France’s principal state theatre\), and at the  [Avignon Festival](https://festival-avignon.com/fr/edition-2018/programmation/forum-des-nouvelles-ecritures-dramatiques-europeennes-4883). In 2019, it played at the National Theatre of Sweden \(the  [Dramaten Theatre](https://www.dramaten.se/Repertoar-arkiv/halla-andan/), Stockholm\). 

 At the 2017 Edinburgh International Festival \(EIF\), Harris’s work formed the  [core of the drama programme](https://www.eif.co.uk/festival-guide/news-and-blogs/international-festival-portraits-zinnie-harris) \(and won a  [Herald Angel award](https://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/15498597.angels-reach-out-across-edinburgh-and-europe/)\) when the directors programmed her work and co\-produced with two leading Scottish theatres: her trilogy *This Restless House* \(winner, Best New Play, Critics’ Award for Theatre in Scotland, originally produced by  [The Citizens Theatre](https://www.citz.co.uk/whatson/info/oresteia-this-restless-house/archived), Glasgow\); her version of Ionesco’s *Rhinoceros* \(a co\-production between the  [Royal Lyceum Theatre](https://lyceum.org.uk/whats-on/production/rhinoceros-international-festival), Edinburgh, and EIF\); and the premiere of *Meet me at Dawn* \(a  [co\-production between Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, and EIF](https://www.eif.co.uk/whats-on/2017/dawn)\). *Meet me at Dawn* played to a capacity of 88% at the Traverse where it was seen by over 5,000 people; subsequent productions of *Meet Me at Dawn* include a month at the  [Market Theatre](https://markettheatre.co.za/production-gallery/meet-me-at-dawn/), Johannesburg \(South Africa’s principal and most prestigious theatre\) in 2018 and four months at  [DOT Theatre](https://go-dot.org/meet-me-at-dawn/), Istanbul \(December 2017 – April 2018\). The Turkish production was then re\-created at the  [Arcola Theatre](https://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/meet-me-at-dawn/), London, in 2019. 

 \(b\) Harris’s work has catalysed changes to programming practice at two leading Scottish theatres and festivals: the Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, the ‘ [west of Scotland’s major producing theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Theatre)’, and the Edinburgh International Festival, which in 2017 had an [attendance of more than 461,000 people from 83 nations, more than 2,200,000 users of online resources and ticket sales of more than GPB4,390,000](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ws-eif/production/assets/headerimages/EIFS-2017-Annual-Review.pdf?mtime=20180730175505). EIF’s placement of a female playwright’s work at the centre of their 2017 drama programme by staging a diverse range of Harris’s plays, two in co\-productions with other prestigious Scottish theatres, was almost certainly unprecedented in the Festival’s history. Of the four world premieres in this 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary EIF \(part of the world’s largest arts festival\), two were by Harris \[S2, p. 10, 15\]. Moreover, in 2019 the Citizens Theatre programmed new work by women playwrights, including Harris, in their season ‘Citizens Women’ “ [*putting women characters – and therefore women actors – centre stage*](https://www.citz.co.uk/site/info/citizens-women)”. The theatre’s Artistic Director directly attributed this decision to Harris’s work which “ *has led specifically to my programming a whole season of work at the Citizens that is written by women and which puts female characters at the heart of the stories that are told \[...\] having made this programming decision, it is beholden on me and other artistic directors to ensure that these stories remain central to the work we present”* \[S3\]. 

 \(c\) Harris’s work has fostered wider increases in women’s representation in professional theatre in South Africa and the UK, in a context where only a fifth of English theatres have female directors controlling only 13% of the Arts Council budget \[S4, p. 2\]. Harris’s plays provided opportunities for women actors in their thirties and forties to take centre stage roles at a time when work typically starts to thin as Kirsty Stuart \(nominated for  [Best Actress](https://criticsawards.theatrescotland.com/2020-shortlist/) at CATS awards for her lead role in  [*The Duchess*](https://lyceum.org.uk/whats-on/production/the-duchess-of-malfi)\) attests: “ *As a wom\[a\]n actor in my late thirties, it has been a frustrating few years \[…but Harris’s work is\] creating roles for women and showing that stories with \[older\] women at the centre are just as thrilling, heart\-breaking, terrifying, inspiring and watchable*” \[S5, p. 1\]. Several actors went on to win awards for these roles, including Pauline Knowles \( [Best Actress at CATS](https://criticsawards.theatrescotland.com/2016-winners/) awards, 2016, for her Clytemnestra in *This Restless House*\). Furthermore, the Market Theatre \(Johannesburg\) production of *Meet Me at Dawn* was “ [*supported by an all\-women design and production team*](https://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/movies/reviews/tv-stars-light-up-the-stage-in-lyrical-fable-meet-me-at-dawn-14107483)”, the review for South African news website IOL implicitly attributing this to the subject of Harris’s work: “ [*The play carries universal themes of grief and loss. But it is also centred around the relationship between two women*](https://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/movies/reviews/tv-stars-light-up-the-stage-in-lyrical-fable-meet-me-at-dawn-14107483)”. The novelty of this was also discussed by award\-winning actor Pamela Nomvete on SABC News \(South African state morning TV\) in March 2018, Nomvete stating that ‘ [the all\-female team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YX4NLU2uo4)’ was one of the factors that ‘attracted’ her to the role \[S5, p. 6\]. 

 **2. Harris’s plays catalyse national and international public debate about women’s roles in theatre.** 

 Through her plays, Harris has been a major voice in raising debate on this topic. Public discussion of women’s roles in theatre has burgeoned since 2015. Harris’s role in the debate is clearly evident: Harris is often invited to comment on it; her influence on the debate is cited; and the topic is documented in audiences’ responses to her plays. In a programme note for the 2016 all\-women *Shakespeare Trilogy* at the Donmar Theatre, London, for example, *The Guardian*’s Chief Culture Writer discussed the gender divide in theatre, noting: the “ *main character \[of* How to Hold Your Breath *\], played by Maxine Peake, reminded me how rare it is to see a woman carrying the weight of a universal story, undefined by romantic attachment”* \[S6, p. 2\]. Similarly, in 2017 tweets about *Meet me at Dawn* by audience member Natalie Ibu \(now Artistic Director of Northern Stage Theatre, Newcastle\) stated it was “ *the first time* – *as a queer black woman* – *I get to see myself’* in a play where *‘the drama’ ‘is completely unrelated to my identity. Feels so extraordinary a comment to make that as I type it, I’m desperately thinking back over all the plays I’ve seen in my 33.75 years. Nope. Today is the first*.” \[S6, p. 3\]. 

 Her influence on debate was particularly pronounced in Turkish audiences’ and playwrights’ responses to the events accompanying *Meet me at Dawn*’s Istanbul premiere \(2017\-18\). In the context of a ban on LGBT drama and film in Turkey, the production became the centre of debate about how women are represented onstage and in the media. Three public panels – at which Harris spoke and which were attended by psychiatrists, feminist/LGBT activists, students and the public – sold out within 48 hours and were attended by more than 200 people and watched by more than 600 online; the premiere and panels were described by the Director of Sabanci University’s Gender and Women’s Studies Centre as a “ *unique and valuable space*” inspiring discussion of sexuality, gender and trauma \[S7, p. 2\]. Harris’s workshops with and two\-year mentoring of 13 people \(young Turkish, Kurdish and Iranian playwrights\) led to 10 of the 13 writing their debut plays on “ *gender\-informed subject matters*” \[S1, pp. 3\-4\]; the Turkish newspaper *Milliyet* described them as “ *a new wave of playwrights who will make a difference*” \[S1, p. 4\]. Harris’s collaboration with one playwright, who became her Turkish translator, led to his appointment as Affiliate Artist at  [UNESCO RILA](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/unesco/) \(Refugee Integration Through Arts\). He writes: “ *Harris and her works have produced a new generation of playwrights; created employment for more than 30 professionals \(more than half of them are women\) \[...\]; brought national and international awards and nominations; and started a huge public discussion around gender politics of theatre’.* \[Harris’s work\] *‘has created an unparalleled ripple effect on our lives, community and on our craft’* \[and\] *‘has become a barometer of sexual politics of representation’*.” \[S1, pp. 6\-7\]. 

 **3. Harris’s work leaves a creative legacy for playwrights, directors, actors and audiences.** 

 Harris’s plays have: won the Berwin Lee award for best play in the USA/UK; won the Critics’ Award for Best New Play, Scotland, once and been short\-listed twice; been shortlisted for the Susan Smith Blackburn award; and won a Herald Angel award. In February 2019, distinguished theatre critic Joyce McMillan described Harris as “ [*the leading Scottish playwright and director*](https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/joyce-mcmillan-we-should-do-more-celebrate-scottish-theatre-artists-making-global-splash-100377)”, commending her “ *international reach*” and noting she “ *had three different plays opening across Europe in a single weekend*”. Harris’s works are now established in the British theatrical canon, available to diverse current and future readers and audiences, as is apparent in: at least 17 productions of these 6 plays in the UK and internationally to 31 December 2020; their numerous awards and critical success; and their influence on school and University teaching in the UK and Turkey. An acting edition of *This Restless House* is published for amateur, student and school performances; 644 people \(students\) from 30 schools attended *The Duchess* in Glasgow in 2019 and school workshops sold out \[S8, p. 1\]; and Harris’s Turkish translator was invited to re\-gender the drama curriculum at Istanbul Bilgi University. He included three plays by Harris as well as work by other women and queer dramatists, for which he was commended as Best Lecturer by the University’s Human Rights MA programme director \[S1, p. 6\]. Recognition of the importance of Harris’s creative work led to her elevation to  [Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh](https://www.rse.org.uk/fellow/zinnie-harris/) in 2018. 

 Several female playwrights attest that Harris’s creation and re\-creation of roles for women has profoundly influenced the types of stories they tell. The award\-winning Scottish playwright  [Stef Smith](http://www.stefsmith.co.uk/) writes, “ *Watching* Meet Me at Dawn *has inspired me to continue on my own journey to ensure I am both writing and supporting work that furthers different, complex, multifaceted representations of woman and other identities / communities who are often underserved by the canon of British playwrighting*” \[S9, p.1\]. Palestinian\-Irish playwright  [Hannah Khalil](https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/hannah-khalil) writes: “ *the fact that Zinnie’s plays are being programmed on big stages is vitally important. It makes other female writers know the effort is worthwhile and the fight winnable*” \[S9, p. 2\]. And award\-winning Scottish playwright  [Frances Poet](https://www.playwrightsstudio.co.uk/playwrights/frances-poet.aspx) writes: “ *As a playwright, Zinnie’s influence reigns large \[...\] in Zinnie we have a playwright building worlds around extraordinary female protagonists, offering \[…\] unrivalled roles that reframe what is possible for women on the stage*” \[S9, p. 3\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study demonstrates how research produced at York St John University resulted in increased recognition of perfectionism as an important public health risk. As a result of this research, perfectionism is now \(1\) included in the curriculum of BTEC Sport and Exercise Science, the largest Further Education sports course in the UK, for the first time, \(2\) is part of multiple national and international mental health and wellbeing education programmes and \(3\) has been added as one of the key focuses of a new Department for Education student mental health taskforce. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins>Motivation, Performance, and Wellbeing Research Group \(MPAW\)</ins> 

 MPAW is one of the largest groups in the world dedicated to the study of perfectionism in sport, dance, and exercise. The group was established by Professor Hill and Professor Hall \(now retired\) at York St John University. The group consists of five YSJU academic staff and their research students \(currently six doctoral students\), as well as a wider network of former research students in academic posts at other universities \(Newcastle University, Leeds Beckett University, and London School of Economics and Political Science\). The group has produced 83 research papers, 11 edited book chapters, and 84 national and international conference presentations on the topic of perfectionism since 2014. 

 The main focus of the group’s research has been to challenge the common misconception that perfectionism is beneficial for athletes, dancers, and exercisers. Subsequently, their work has expanded to challenge this misconception in other domains, notably in education. The research of this group has shown that rather than being beneficial, perfectionism has numerous negative consequences, that it is increasing, and that it is especially problematic for mental health and wellbeing. 

 The research of the group has also been funded by the Wellcome Trust, Swedish Research Council for Sport Science, Higher Education Academy, National Association for Able Children in Education \(NACE\), HigherHY, Harold Hyam Wingate Foundation, Goalball UK, and the European Commission/Framework 7. The research is highly cited, receives large amounts of media coverage, and a touchstone for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. 

 <ins>Advancing research in sport, dance, exercise and beyond</ins> 

 Members of MPAW were among the first to publish research examining perfectionism in sport and exercise psychology, and are the largest producers of research in this area according to the SCOPUS database. Some of their earliest and most novel work demonstrated that perfectionistic athletes are at increased risk of burnout, and this has subsequently been extended into other groups \(students and office workers **\[3.1;** **3.2;** **3.3\]**. These findings are particularly important given the inclusion of burnout in the International Classification of Diseases \(11<sup>th</sup> revision; World Health Organization, 2018\). Their research has adopted novel approaches to the study of perfectionism and burnout, including sophisticated statistical analyses to model explanatory psychological processes **\[3.1\]**, testing novel models of perfectionism in sport for the first time **\[3.2\]**, using innovative and difficult methodological designs **\[3.4\]**, and conducting the first ever meta\-analysis of perfectionism and burnout in sport, workplace, and education settings **\[3.3\]**. More recently the group published the first meta\-analytical review of the consequences of perfectionism for athletes **\[3.5\]** and, in doing so, highlighted many other adverse mental and physical health outcomes of perfectionism. Finally, and perhaps most notably, the group published a substantial birth\-cohort study that showed, for the first time, that perfectionism is increasing among young people, and has been for the last thirty years **\[3.6\]**. 

 The research of the group has highlighted that perfectionism is a public health risk, and that it is essential that people are aware of the dangers of perfectionism and seek to address it. This case study reflects the group’s success in raising awareness of the health risks of perfectionism in sport, exercise, and other life domains, especially education.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins>Impact pathways associated with three impacts</ins> 

 Impact pathways have been engagement with journalists in written and digital media, media production companies, producers of educational resources, organisations/scholarly societies and policy makers. 

 Examples include  [articles](https://theconversation.com/how-perfectionism-became-a-hidden-epidemic-among-young-people-89405) in theconversation.com \(republished in over 150 news outlets around the world and read over 500k times\); a  [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_curran_our_dangerous_obsession_with_perfectionism_is_getting_worse) based \(delivered by Dr Curran, an alumni of MPAW\) based on **\[3.6\]** \(2.5 million views\); written press \(e.g., Guardian, Telegraph, Metro\) and radio interviews \(BBC Radio 5live\); BBC article and accompanying online video \(“ [The dangerous downsides of perfectionism](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180219-toxic-perfectionism-is-on-the-rise)” and “ [When perfectionism goes too far](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ideas/videos/when-perfectionism-goes-too-far/p07hnyq8)” viewed over 12k times\); a cover story for New Scientist magazine \( [Issue 3242](https://www.newscientist.com/issue/3243/)\); consultancy for a television programme on perfectionism hosted by Davina McCall broadcast on the W Channel \(“ [The Davina Hour](https://w.uktv.co.uk/the-davina-hour/article/davina-hour-episode-guide/)”\); direct delivery of workshops \(e.g., NHS, Scottish Gymnastics, Mental Health Foundation\); and invited talks \(e.g., Universities UK, Westminster Insight, and the Department of Education\). 

 Specific impact pathways for three impacts are identified below along with the description of the impact. 

 <ins>Impact 1: Perfectionism added to the BTEC Sport and Exercise Science curriculum</ins> 

 As a direct consequence of the group’s research, perfectionism was included for the first time in the curriculum for the BTEC Sport and Exercise Science, the largest Further Education sports course in the UK. Perfectionism is now included on the curriculum of one of the mandatory units for all awards. The inclusion of perfectionism and its link to the BTEC unit author’s knowledge of MPAW research has been confirmed by testimonial **\[5.1\]**. The updated curriculum has been in use since September 2016 \(in the previous iteration of this curriculum \[2010\] perfectionism was not included\). Consequently, since its introduction, a total of approximately 8,300 BTEC students per year have undertaken the course with this updated content **\[5.2\]**. 

 <ins>Impact 2: Perfectionism added to national and international mental health and wellbeing programmes</ins> 

 Perfectionism has now been incorporated into the curricula of several national and international mental health and wellbeing education packages. This includes the “Student Wellbeing Toolkit” from Epigeum **\[5.3\]**, a large provider of online courses designed to support universities in teaching, research, and wellbeing. The toolkit equips students with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage wellbeing issues they face across their university experience. Based on series of research talks and consultancy, a module on perfectionism was created for the toolkit \(“Am I good enough?”\). The toolkit was launched in June 2020 and has so far been used in nine institutions in the UK and six institutions in Australia. The inclusion of perfectionism in the toolkit and direct link to MPAW research has been confirmed by the senior commissioning editor at Epigeum **\[5.4\]**. 

 Perfectionism has similarly been integrated into the work of the NACE. NACE is a charity aimed at improving provision for more able learners, driving whole\-school improvement, and raising achievement. The charity has over 1,000 partner schools nationally and internationally. As a consequence of consultancy with NACE and commissioned research, addressing perfectionism has now be integrated into the support they provide for student and teacher wellbeing. The inclusion of perfectionism and the link to MPAW research has been confirmed by the CEO of NACE **\[5.5\]**. 

 One final example of this type of impact is the work with the Brilliant Club. The Brilliant Club is an award\-winning university access charity that works across the UK to increase the number of pupils from underrepresented backgrounds progressing to highly\-selective universities. It also delivers the Seren Network Conference on behalf of the Welsh Government which is a national network of schools to support the most able students \(over 150 schools and colleges and over 3000 students\). Perfectionism has been added to the professional development programme/strand of the Seren Network Conference with integration of resources developed by MPAW into practice the main focus \(worksheets, lesson plans and an animated video \[“The perils of perfectionism” viewed 9k times\], **\[5.6\]**\). The inclusion of perfectionism in the professional development strand of Seren Network Conference and link to MPAW research has been confirmed by the education and development director at the Brilliant Club **\[5.7\]**. 

 <ins>Impact 3: Perfectionism identified as a risk factor for student mental health by a new government taskforce</ins> 

 The most notable impact of the research has been on the formation and aims of a new government taskforce created by the Department for Education \(DfE\). The taskforce, known as the Education Transitions Network, which is supported by leading education organisations \(e.g., UCAS, Universities UK, Office for Students\), will develop measures to support students as they start university with the aim of addressing mental health problems. The taskforce has explicitly identified perfectionism as a wellbeing risk factor that needs to be addressed **\[5.8\]**. The inclusion of perfectionism as a risk factor was preceded by a visit from the DfE to York St John University, where they met with Professor Hill, and a subsequent visit and talk by Professor Hill at the DfE focused on MPAW research **\[5.9\]**. Correspondence from the chair of the new taskforce confirmed the link between the research of MPAW and the inclusion of perfectionism as a risk factor to be addressed by the taskforce **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Dr Charles** **Bennett’s** research into poetry, and specifically the use of poetry in choral settings, has contributed to the growing interest in, and recognition of song and music as aids to wellbeing. Through an ongoing collaboration with composer Bob Chilcott his work has: 

1.  increased youth participation in the experience of live\-music making; 

1.  enhanced educational and cultural capacity through involvement with schools and other organisations; and 

1.  engaged participants with the texts of songs as ways of generating meaning. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 As a founding member of the University’s Research Centre for Critical & Creative Writing, **Bennett** has contributed significant research outputs in poetry. A core component of **Bennett’s** outputs has included librettos commissioned by pre\-eminent composer Bob Chilcott. **Bennett** writes the lyric first, and Chilcott’s composition, and subsequent rehearsals and performances, are dedicated to conveying its meaning. This case study focuses on the work he created for young voices. 

 Each output, particularly the song\-cycles **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]**, are meticulously crafted and created in dialogue with the commissioners. Writing takes place over several months, and demands a deep understanding of the issues and aims of individual commissions. In each case, a desire to write powerfully, meaningfully and emotively informs **Bennett’s** work. A key aim of the selected projects is to create choral music specifically for young people which incorporates exciting elements, memorable melody and an underlying seriousness of intent. In these works, **Bennett** respects and honours young people’s levels of comprehension, as opposed to ‘writing down’ in a condescending way. 

 Magdalen College School, Oxford, commissioned two works by **Bennett** and Chilcott for their choir: *Five Days that Changed the World* **\[3.1\]** and *The Miracle of the Spring* **\[3.2\]**. *Five Days that Changed the World* a song\-cycle framed as a series of dramatic monologues pinpointing significant dates in history such as the invention of printing, the abolition of slavery, the invention of powered flight, the discovery of penicillin and the first man in space. Meanwhile, *The Miracle of the Spring*, is a series of reflections on the significance and meaning of water as a valuable resource. Both were especially designed for young voices. 

 In 2016, Age UK commissioned **Bennett** to produce a libretto for the Campaign to End Loneliness, supported by Arts Council England and charitable trusts. Age UK requested a text which examined aspects of separation and elderliness. **Bennett’s** response was to create a libretto which, in a series of symbolic allegories, examined progress though time, and levels of connectedness, especially the vital reinvigoration of the elderly through generational contact with the young. The resulting work, *The Voyage* **\[3.3\]**, is a song cycle exploring aspects of ageing; its première performances were in March 2016: at the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford and at Reading Concert Hall. In performance, the work combines older and younger voices, to create evocative music about a journey through life which all can access and enjoy at whatever stage of singing ability. 

 Similar commissions followed. This included three children’s choirs in the United Kingdom and United States who commissioned *The Midnight of Your Birth* a song cycle for upper voices **\[3.4\]**, and the Heinz Chapel Choir University, Pittsburgh *,* who commissioned *When Spring Comes Walking*. **\[3.5\]**. The success of *The Midnight of Your Birth* led to the United States’ Pacific International Choral Festival \(PIC Fest\) commissioning *Lightwaves*, a song cycle of five poems connected by the theme of light, aimed specifically at young performers **\[3.6\]**. The song was performed as part of PicFest’s virtual festival \(6th August 2020\), when the festival shifted online after the impact of the Covid\-19 pandemic.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 As music in the primary education curriculum has declined, a corresponding need has been established for schools with choirs to seek opportunities for performances through alternative means outside of school provision. To this end, schools and support organisations have commissioned **Bennett**, through his collaboration with Chilcott, to create texts specifically for school choirs. **Bennett’s** work with Chilcott has led to a variety of performances and school workshops which have impacted those involved with creating choral music for younger voices, including students, choral directors, and the choral viewing public. Chilcott has attested to **Bennett’s** vital contribution in this by claiming, ‘Without his words, none of these commissions, performances or impacts would have occurred’ **\[5.1\]**. The continuing popularity and success of these collaborations is testimony to the achievement of **Bennett’s** aims to create poetry that resonates with young voices and encourages participation in choral music. 

 The stakeholders who have participated in performances of **Bennett’s** work have received the enhancements that accompany engaging in live music making, particularly in the following areas: 

 **Increased opportunities for youth participation in the experience of live\-music making through engagement with school choirs** 

 When creating a piece for young voices, **Bennett** & Chilcott often work with educational establishments to bring these benefits to students. **Bennett’s** work has generated an increase in capacity, ambition, and achievement for young people who have participated in performances and school workshops based on the commissions with Chilcott. 

 Three new carols, which comprise part of the song\-cycle *The Midnight of your Birth*, were written specifically for Oxford High Junior School \(UK\), the Cleveland Orchestra Children’s Chorus and the St Louis Children’s Choirs \(USA\), and subsequently performed by around 150 children in the three choirs. The Director of the Chamber Choir of Oxford High Junior School commented on the importance of singing for the students, ‘which is something they love’ **\[5.2\]**. According to the Director, the bespoke carol’s ‘words fit so beautifully with the music that it \[…\] was a joy to teach’ **\[5.2\]**. For some of the children in the Oxford choir it was their ‘first time’ performing **\[5.2\]**. 

 Additionally, the entire carol sequence was both performed and recorded by Benenden School. The Director of Music at Benenden School commented that in ‘coaching and then listening to the girls performing the five carols in your set, I have detected just the right level of understanding, respect, and desire to interpret the words’. Furthermore, he stated that he ‘can't think of any modern carols which have the same kind of freshness and clarity about them, yet which are still tied to the traditions which choirs and their audiences find so reassuring year after year.’ ‘They strike the perfect balance between singable yet not without challenge’, he added **\[5.3\]**. Overall, this resulted in ‘accessible \(in the best sense of the word\!\) music and lyrics \[that\] particularly resonate with young singers’. Of the 74 pupils who performed the carols, 34 recorded the sequence for CD in March 2019. The production of this successful CD raised the confidence of the pupils, provided them with the experience of participating in a professional recording, and created effective promotion for the school choir. 

 Similarly, *The Miracle of the Spring* was created for Magdalen College School, Oxford, in 2014. The school’s Director of Music reported: 

 students who participated in *Miracle of the Spring* benefitted in ways which went way beyond the educational. It is a unique and amazing experience for a choir to give the first performance of a work. Although we had commissioned some carols before, *Miracle of the Spring* was the first commissioned work on a bigger scale that the choir had attempted. It increased their confidence and self\-belief, and this had an impact not only academically, but also enabled growth of personality **\[5.4\]**. 

 Performances of *The Voyage* also provided young singers the opportunity to participate in several large\-scale live performances in Oxford and Reading. An international performance took place in Minneapolis, with VocalEssence performing the American premier in October 2016. To create the performance, the Artistic Director collaborated with the Minnesota Youth Chorus and two choirs for experienced singers, Vintage Voices and Voices of Experience, with participants ranging in age from 9\-90. The Choir’s Associate Director, who conducted the work, stated that 

 We are finding the older adults energized by the kids. The kids are going to be inspired to continue in music by the older adults. Everyone will learn from each other. The unifying force of music rings clear in their performance **\[5.5\]**. 

 During the Covid\-19 pandemic, **Bennett** and Chilcott’s new commission *Lightwaves* was performed as part of the Picfest virtual festival in August 2020. Both **Bennett** & Chilcott participated live, and two songs from the cycle were featured and performed by choirs across Canada and the USA, and in the Philippines \(Young Voices of the Philippines\). The performances featured approximately 100 young people and filled a gap in provision for live\-music opportunities during the Covid\-19 pandemic, ensuring that the young singers still had the opportunity to perform **\[5.6\]**. 

 **Increased Community Participation and Cohesion through Live\-Music Performance** 

 Age UK Oxfordshire commissioned *The Voyage* as part of their Campaign to End Loneliness. The rehearsal process and performance united younger and older people in a joint performance. Each concert included three choirs of mixed ages and experience, and young musicians. For the Oxford performances, The Oxfordshire School’s Singers, Berkshire Youth Choir and players from Oxfordshire County Youth Orchestra took part in this. Reading performances featured the Aeolian Choir, Dacorum Community Choir, Sandringham School Choir and musicians from St Albans School. Through these two performances, around 400 children of primary school age, many of whom were new to live performance, engaged in the process of live music making. 

 The CEO of Age UK Oxfordshire noted that the process allowed both groups to ‘help each other’ by ‘creating new relationships, new singing opportunities for those society has forgotten’ **\[5.7\]**. In addition to the performances, there were outreach programs to combat loneliness in the community, which led to further connections between younger and older community members, the establishment of new singing groups in the county, and writing groups that explicitly drew on the themes **Bennett** presented in his text **\[5.7\]**. He noted that ‘Bob Chilcott's sublime music and Charles **Bennett's** evocative text’ **\[5.7\]** was essential in creating meaningful community outreach activities, ultimately leading to the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards \(the highest recognition for live classical music in the UK\) shortlisting *The Voyage* under its Learning & Participation category for ‘an outstanding initiative or organisation which set out to engage and have a lasting positive impact on the lives of people who may not otherwise experience classical music’ **\[5.7\]**. Its position on the shortlist was a testament to the project’s innovative approach to youth participation, education and intergenerational collaboration. 

 Singers who participated in the United States premier of the Voyage in Minnesota, also reported increased community cohesion and connections through the process of performing the piece. One of the younger members of the choir stated that ‘the community \[they\] built’ through the rehearsal process was ‘just wonderful’ **\[5.5\]**; something that was confirmed by an older member, who stated that ‘Working together on this piece makes us feel like we are reaching out and embracing the community’ **\[5.5\]**. 

 **Engaged participants and audiences with the texts of songs as ways of generating meaning and reflection.** 

 Performers, commissioners and conductors often express a profound connection with the lyric. 

 Participants in *The Voyage* reflected that their experience of Charles **Bennett's** poetry inspired them to think differently about aging and ‘the cycle of life’ **\[5.8\]**. One singer noted that the text ‘made me think about my own grandmother. She lives alone, and we do what we can, but certain passages \- most of The Fortunate Isles, for instance \- really hit home that loneliness can be physically painful, as well as emotionally’. Another participant mentioned that the ‘words are meaningful so as to inspire thoughts and consideration for the elderly people and their wish to enjoy life as all others, feeling entitled to as much fulfilment as they had in their youth. Having elderly parents, I especially connected to this.’ While another commented that it had increased their thinking about 'loneliness and growing older'. Some of the younger participants noted that it brought their attention to the aging process in new ways, with one stating that it helped them 'identify with aspects of aging \[they\] wouldn't otherwise consider \(as a ""younger"" person\). Another participant testified that engagement with **Bennett's** poetry was 'quite compelling' and inspired them to enquire about further volunteer opportunities at Age UK **\[5.8\]**. 

 The Director of the Heinz Chapel Choir at the University of Pittsburgh commented that their 14 April 2019 performance of *When Spring Comes Walking* had ‘a profound impact’ on the 45 singers aged below 21. Their discussions of the text resulted in ‘an emotional conversation’ which fed into the ‘importance they placed on singing your words with sincere depth of emotion’. Additionally, she reflected that ‘the music and poetry were perfectly matched and played beautifully to the musical and emotional strengths of the choir’ **\[5.9\]**. When touring with the choir, she testified that this piece received ‘the greatest observable emotional response by the audience members at both the ""home"" performances and ""on the road""’. She believes 

 that these tour performances of *When Spring Comes Walking*, in particular, are testament to the genuine connection each choir member felt to the piece, to one another, and to each member of every audience in singing it **\[5.9\]**. 

 **Continued impacts through subsequent sales of the music and their use in choral settings:** 

 **Bennett’s** works continue to involve young performers around the world, through sales of the works and subsequent performances by choirs. Figures provided by Oxford University Press show that, as of September 2020, **Bennett’s** works have sold over 12,842 copies since publication. *Five Days that Changed the World* has achieved 7,500 international sales \(over and above the 2,800 copies sold in the UK\) **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Peatlands cover 3% of the Earth’s land surface yet store more carbon than all the world’s plant biomass combined. Damaged peatlands emit more than 5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gases. The work of Mr Richard Lindsay has been “instrumental” in stimulating improved commitment to sustainable management and restoration of peatlands within **decision\-making at the global scale** by shaping inter\-governmental treaties and **UN policy development**, **changes in international law**, as well as **national policy development** within government departments and national bodies together with local initiatives supporting **award\-winning individual businesses** and communities actively involved in the sustainable management of peatlands. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As a result of many land\-use pressures, peatlands globally are in a poor state, emitting carbon rather than storing it on millennial timescales as they would do in the natural state. Peatlands represent the UK’s most extensive semi\-natural habitat and largest soil\-carbon store but 80% of UK peatlands are damaged. Peatlands subject to arable agriculture alone emit more carbon than any other form of land use. Lindsay’s research provides detailed insights into the repercussions resulting from these pressures and offers solutions in a number of cases, influencing inter\-governmental decision\-making about peatland ‘wise\-use’ at regional and global scales. 

  

 Figure 1 Render of Peatland Pavilion 



Lindsay has collaborated with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation **\(R2, S7a\),** the EU European Topic Centre **\(R1, 2\)** and with researchers in the Congo and Amazonia, to highlight the urgent need for better mapping of the world’s peatlands.  He is currently working with the UN Environment Programme to develop a Peatland Pavilion for Climate Cop26, having produced a global assessment of peatlands for the UN\-led Intergovernmental Science\-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services \(IPBES\) Assessment of Land Degradation and Restoration **\(R1\)**. 

  

 Lindsay’s 2004 report on the Derrybrien peatslide caused by windfarm development continues to be widely cited, including by the Scottish Government guidance on assessing peatslide risk and continues to inform rulings of the European Court of Justice **\(S4\)**. 

  

 Collaboration between the Griefswald Mire Centre and peatland researchers across Europe has resulted in Lindsay providing the first comprehensive review of UK peatlands within the context of European peatlands as a whole **\(R4\)**. Working jointly with University of Edinburgh researchers, Lindsay published a critical assessment of methods windfarm companies use to evaluate potential impacts on peatlands **\(R5\)**, while collaboration with the University of Queensland has resulted in a re\-assessment of peatlands in the Great Sandy Strait, and collaboration with Nottingham Trent University and Spanish authorities has resulted in new understanding of peatlands in the Cantabrian Mountains.  Ongoing collaboration with RSPB and the IUCN UK Peatland Programme **\(S5a\)** has generated a range of published work based on the original Peat Bogs and Carbon report \( **S5b**\). 

 
This has led to commissioned research from both Natural England **\(S8\)** and Scottish Natural Heritage \(SNH\) **\(R4\)**, the former requiring detailed analysis for a successful Lands Tribunal case, plus a critical assessment of the UK’s longest\-running peatland experimental plots, while SNH required a critical assessment of the science behind recent planning guidance.

-  *“The methodology adopted by \[UEL\]…resulted in a change in the law in respect of the measurement of damages in such cases.”* Testimonial from Solicitor acting for Derrybrien village, Co. Galway **\(S4b\).** 

  

 Lindsay’s research **continues to influence recent decisions** in the European Court of Justice over the 2003 peatslide case in Co. Galway **\(S4\)**, but has also brought about **changes in policy** **thinking** about the importance of shallow peat in both the UK and internationally **\(S7a\)**. Publication of the UN\-led IPBES Assessment Report on Land Degradation and Restoration **\(R1\)**, and the drafting of Resolution 43 adopted at the 2016 IUCN World Conservation Congress **\(S6\)** has stimulated global governmental recognition of the need for action to halt ongoing degradation and urgently initiate restoration of peatlands. This work continues at an international level through Lindsay’s active membership of both the UN FAO Restoration Monitoring Task Force and the Ramsar Convention Restoration Task Force, and at a domestic level through Lindsay’s membership of Defra’s Lowland Peat Task Force \( **S3**\). 

  

 <ins> **Commerce and industry collaboration**</ins> 

  

 There is increasing acknowledgement that conventional farming on peat soils is unsustainable while management practices on upland blanket mires have led to widespread degradation. Lindsay works with a number of partners **,** including the SME Micropropagation Services, ADAS and Defra, to develop sustainable ways forward for both upland and lowland practices. This work has enabled Micropropagation Services **\(S1\)** to expand and improve business opportunities in both upland restoration and lowland agriculture sectors. Lindsey provides advice about the benefits of such initiatives to policy\-making bodies such as Defra **\(S3\)** and the UK Committee for Climate Change e.g. In the forum of the Defra\-funded Peat Pilots Projects Steering Committee.  Lindsay has supported other commercial ventures by severing as the scientific advisor for the film production company Top of the Tree, producer of a multi award\-winning film about carbon farming **\(S2\)**.

-  *“Richard’s work on communicating through animation how peatlands are formed, how they function and how they are damaged is an excellent example. I only wish that such excellent material was available for other complex topics\!”* Testimonial from Liam Cashman, European Commission **\(S4a\)** *.* 

  

 Building on the impact of Lindsay’s 2010 report about *Peat Bogs and Carbon*, key topics from that report have subsequently been addressed in an accessible way through a series of Briefing Notes which are hosted as **an open\-access “invaluable” resource** on the IUCN UK Peatland Programme website **\(S5b\)**.  Briefings and Fact Sheets about peatlands have also been drafted or co\-drafted by Lindsay for the Ramsar Convention, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the IUCN.  Lindsay produced animations to explain key peatland topics, available as open\-access resources on the IUCN UK Peatland Programme website **\(S5b\)**, while a Q&A session held with Olivia Blake MP, available on her YouTube Channel, looks at a range of peatland concerns including the managed burning of blanket bog moorlands **\(S9\)**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 This case study focuses on Marine Engineering, illustrating three complementary strands of research for improving ship design, and focusing on improved safety, comfort, stability and performance for ships and vessels. From the original UCL trimaran concept, the US Navy has built a fleet of thirteen Independence Class ships. World leading construction companies of offshore installations such as Hyundai Heavy Industries \(HHI\) and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering \(DSME\), implement UCL research outputs for their safety engineering of topside modules of floating production storage and offloading vessels \(FPSOs\). Shipbuilder, Incat, have incorporated UCL outcomes to guide the design of their vessels, introducing structural changes and saving EUR4,700,000 worth of alloy and fabrication costs. Novel design and analysis methods have been incorporated into the MAESTRO software to optimise ship structural design \(used globally across 23 countries\), and Paramarine® \(SURFCON\) software \(with over 200 user organisations worldwide\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 UCL Marine Engineering research focuses on improved ship engineering for defence, commercial and complex ship designs. This is presented in three complementary strands of research; i\) novel design concepts for trimarans, catamarans and complex ships \(ii\)  shipping optimisation through nonlinear finite element models and \(iii\) reduced waste emission from the shipping industry. 

 UCL research on ship design has focussed on novel designs for trimarans and catamarans and new design approaches for complex ships. UCL developed the trimaran ship concept and led research activities in this field; from initial design concept, computational and experimental research and analyses of ship trials, along with contributions to a Classification Society’s Ship Design Rules \( **R1**\). The concept was adopted by the UK Ministry of Defence \(MoD\) with a scaled 6m trimaran model of a 3,000\-tonne destroyer, designed at UCL. When commencing an extensive series of trials for design and operational performance in 2000 \(such as sea\-keeping and helicopter operations\), the results of this UCL\-led research were sufficiently promising for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency \(DERA\) to commission a two\-thirds\-scale Trimaran Technology Demonstrator built by Vosper Thornycroft, Southampton \(UK\). 

  

 UCL revolutionised the trimaran concept through predicted performance from hydrodynamic and structural perspectives, in turn publishing a comprehensive guide to the preliminary design of trimaran vessels \( **R2**\). UCL research into trimaran performance continued through Office of Naval Research \(ONR\) funding with The Atlantic Center for the Innovative Design and Control of Ships \(ACCeSS\), with UCL as the only UK academic partner. Working with the Naval Surface Warfare Center \(NSWC\) Carderock on the design, testing and technology development for trimaran hullforms research addressed parametric resonance \(the interaction of waves with hullform\) and side\-hull positioning, namely the relative location of the smaller sidehulls to the centre hullform \( **R3**\). 

 Catamaran hullforms are predominantly used as high\-speed craft for both commercial and naval applications. They need to be lightweight, but strong enough to withstand loads imparted onto them from large waves. Research at UCL, in collaboration with Incat Tasmania, Revolution Designs and the University of Tasmania, has investigated the motions and loads characteristics of high\-speed craft through a combination of numerical work, full\-scale measurements and physical model experiments \( **R4**\). This work has been funded by a series of Australian Research Council Linkage grants, the most recent awarded in 2018; with additional partners being the National Research Council of Italy \- Institute of Marine Engineering \(CNR\-INSEAN\) and the University of New South Wales. Results from both towing tank and drop test experiments with a hydroelastic model provided a new understanding of the effect of hullform shape on the magnitude of wave loads and how changes to the form of the centrebow can reduce the loads experienced by the vessels \( **R4**\). 

 UCL research into a more architectural approach to complex ship design resulted in a highly novel approach, the Design Building Block \(DBB\) approach. This changes the basis of the initial ship synthesis and hence the resultant design process from the largely ""outside\-in"" underwater hull form focus to an ""inside\-out"" architectural approach, integrated with traditionally preferred sizing with a balance between weight, space and stability. By driving the size of a given design option from the internal and upper decks architectural demands this enables a more informative design exploration, bringing critical operational and human aspects to the fore in initial complex ship design decision making \( **R5**\) and with this a better basis for costing and efficient design for production. 

 From a safety perspective, accidents associated with ships and offshore structures continue to occur and can lead to environmental catastrophes with loss of lives and assets. Work at UCL identified that qualitative approaches with intuitive models and insights are not accurate enough to calculate frequency and consequence and assess risks. Therefore, to improve floating production storage and offloading vessels \(FPSOs\) safety against accidents, quantitative risk assessment methods have been developed using advanced computational models and physical model testing. 

 A new probabilistic method was developed to select a set of credible accident scenarios, where probability density distributions for individual random parameters affecting an accident were characterised based on a large database of historical evidence and a sampling technique was employed to select a limited number of realistic scenarios. Nonlinear finite element method models involving structural crashworthiness in accidents have been formulated for the consequence analysis. Ultimate Limit States \(ULS\) for ship structural design optimisation with multiple objectives, were implemented for ship optimisation process. ULS calculations \( **R5**, **R6**\) were incorporated in ship design software Paramarine® and MAESTRO, to perform fast ULS calculations at each iteration step for the optimisation process. 

 Full\-scale or large\-scale physical model tests on steel stiffened plate structures \(which are the dominant feature of ship and offshore structures\), have been conducted in association with direct measurements of welding\-induced initial imperfections, ultimate compressive limit states at cryogenic condition triggered by brittle fracture, ultimate limit states under lateral patch loading in fires, blast pressure characteristics in hydrocarbon explosions, and collision impacts between ships and icebergs in Arctic operations \( **R6, R7**\). 

 Global shipping currently accounts for approximately 3% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Two major EPSRC research projects were led by UCL to find solutions to reduce these emissions.  UCL developed technical models of ship performance with the ability to accurately predict the influence of alternative fuels, hydrodynamic devices and efficiency improvement techniques, such as sails and micro bubbles, on fuel consumption and emissions. A concept design tool, the Ship Impact Model \(SIM\), was developed to rapidly calculate the technical performance of a vessel with one or more Carbon dioxide Reducing Technologies \(CRTs\) at an early design stage. The SIM was used to assess which selection \(individual or combination\) of CRTs have the most potential, in terms of cost\-effectiveness and under other technical, operational and regulatory influences \( **R8**\). These technical models were then integrated into a UCL\-developed techno\-economic model of the global shipping industry, GLOTRAM. The GLOTRAM model reflects changes in the shipping sector by simulating its growth over time. 

 UCL researchers identified that greater efficiency could be achieved through waste heat recovery and worked with a marine diesel\-engine manufacturer \(MTU\), Lloyds Register and Bowman Power Ltd with funding from Innovate UK. In this work, the waste heat recovery process was modelled and practical testing carried out in conjunction with Cranfield University. The energy efficiency results were applied to typical operational profiles of small ships \(such as ferries and coastal tankers\) to determine overall efficiency savings; typically, savings of 5% were identified leading to a payback in approximately six years.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 UCL engineering continues to work on shipping optimisation for defence and commercial use, to improve ships’ design, performance, safety and stability. For example, through novel design shipping concepts, research outputs continue to generate shipping contracts and reduce manufacturing costs. UCL work has also implemented additional safety parameters through ship design software, in turn promoting environmental changes for shipping emissions pathways.  As such, work on low carbon technology and waste recovery have reduced environmental impact in the naval industry. 

 **UCL trimaran concept in shipping industry** 

 UCL developed the new concept of a trimaran ship; the research demonstrated advantages of trimaran ships for ferries and naval vessels \( **R1\-R3**\). These ships have high speed characteristics due to their slender hulls, large deck areas for carrying cargo and equipment, inherently good performance in waves \(over 50% reduction in motion sickness compared to a catamaran\), yet providing extended operational profiles compared to monohulls \(up to 70% improvement\) \( **S1\)**. Large ship builders have used UCL research outputs \( **R1\-R3**\) to build their vessels. For example, 13 Independence Class trimarans of ​Littoral ​Combat Ships \(LCS\) have been constructed for the US Navy between 2010\-2020 \(the latest USS Savannah was launched on 8<sup>th</sup> September 2020\). Four LCS are currently under construction with a further three on order **\(S2\)**, with the contract for each vessel worth approximately USD584,000,000 \( **S2**\). UCL research also led Austal USA \(a global defence and commercial ship builder\) to construct four high speed trimaran ferries for Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, each costing approximately AUD95,000,000 **\(S2\)**. 

 Another large high\-speed ferry builder, Incat, has used research outputs \( **R4**\) to guide the design of their vessels, to ensure that their vessels are structurally reliable. UCL research has led to changes in the bow shape of Incat vessels to reduce the wave loads and improve passenger comfort \(by 25%\), leading to structural weight savings of the order of “\[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\] *in large vessels, this reduction in alloy and fabrication costs is worth approximately* \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\]” **\(S3\)**. 

 The DBB approach \( **R5**\) has be used to develop ship designs for organisations and companies such as the UK MoD, BMT, DSTL, UK Shipbuilders & Shiprepairers Association, Canadian Defence Dept, US Navy ONR and Columbian Navy. Many of these studies were in support of governments and industry decision\-making on major warship programmes \(e.g. UK Type 26 Frigate, Canadian Joint Support Ship programme, UK Offshore Patrol Vessels, new Colombian Frigate\). The DBB approach has also provided insights to inform specific design policies \(e,g, topside design \(NDP\), personnel movement beyond just escape \(UK DNA\), design for survivability \(DSTL\), AXV impact on ship design \(Babcock, BAES, NDP\) and distributed systems \(USNavy\-ONR\). 

 **Improved safety for naval architecture design** 

 UCL research into safety approaches \( **R6, R7**\) has led to changes of practice in global industry leaders. The outcomes from UCL research associated with quantitative risk assessment and management against fires and explosions have been transferred to the world’s leading construction companies of offshore installations, namely Hyundai Heavy Industries \(HHI\) and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering \(DSME\). They partnered in the Joint Industry Projects and are using research outputs \( **R6, R7**\) for their safety engineering of topside modules of FPSOs, for safer structures against extreme conditions and accidents. The outcomes have been used to achieve safer structures with improved tolerances against such extreme conditions and accidents. HHI state **\(S4\)** that using research outcomes has “ *provided the impacts associated with not only economical benefits by lowering engineering costs but also safer structural designs by enhancing the safety and production quality. Depending on the complexity and size of structures, the benefits have been achieved up to 5 million USD per vessel*”. 

 UCL research outputs on ULS \( **R5, R6**\) have been directly implemented into MAESTRO software, for design optimisation. Specifically, into ALPS/ULSAP and ALPS/HULL computation modules, to provide computational efficiency and greater accuracy for buckling and ultimate strength for plates and stiffened panels, and hull girder collapse for ships. These outputs have been successfully integrated into MAESTRO to improve ship structural design. MAESTRO Marine LLC state “ *The combined capabilities of MAESTRO with ALPS/ULSAP has ensured that MAESTRO has an advanced capability for structural panel\-level limit\-state analysis. Together the ALPS computational tools enable large scale optimization of sophisticated warships and advanced commercial vessels…and in supporting effective in\-service structural engineering for ships through their life cycles*.” **\(S5\)**. 

 There are 90 active ALPS users are in 23 countries, including Navy \(eg US, Japan, Australia, Spain, Brazil, Columbia, South Korea\), Coast Guard \(eg USCG\) and engineering companies \(eg Navantia, Ingles, BIW, DSTO, SeaxeMers, Serco\). User SpaarnWater have used Maestro for structural evaluation of maritime objects for over a decade **\(S6\)**. In a testimonial SpaarnWater state “ *MAESTRO is an excellent tool to perform a structural analysis of a complete maritime structure already in an early stage of the design process supporting the naval architect in his design decisions. SpaarnWater will continue to use MAESTRO as its main tool in structural design and analysis of maritime objects*.” 

  

 Qinetiq, another user of UCL computational models through Paramarine®, state the tool is "" *an integrated naval architectural design and analysis tool set \(enabling\) seamless collaboration between global teams*"", including *""over 200 organisations worldwide""* and used on "" *designs from aircraft carriers and submarines to commercial ships and megayachts*"" **\(S7\)**. 

 **Reducing the environmental Impact of shipping** 

 Through stakeholders’ collaborations, UCL research outputs have also helped reduce the environmental impact of the shipping industry by providing tools that support development of low carbon technology and better waste recovery. The improved technical models for ship designs, technology developments, and low carbon technology \( **R8**\) were amalgamated into GLOTRAM, UCL Energy Institute’s \(UCL\-EI\) techno\-social\-economic model of the global shipping industry. GLOTRAM influenced the shipping industry through changes in transport demand, macroeconomics \(such as fuel, carbon price and newbuild price inflation\), and the availability of technology and regulation \(such as regulations on greenhouse gases and other emissions to air\). 

 As such, the success of UCL\-EI collaboration led to the allocation of the 3rd IMO GHG study, commissioned by the UN agency International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\) estimating the total GHG emissions from shipping; and has become a key reference in industry and policy debates. This work was submitted in its entirety to the IMO by the governments of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Marshall Islands, Netherlands, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu in the 71<sup>st</sup> session UN IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee \(MEPC\), at a critical point in the negotiation leading up to the climate deal **\(S8\)**. Not only has the MEPC become the key reference for future shipping emissions pathways aligned with the Paris Agreement temperature goals **\(S9\)**, but also provides technical background for specifying key commitments in the UK government’s breakthrough policy Clean Maritime Plan, as well as to achieve UK government objectives on reaching net\-zero by 2050. 

 Through the UCL\-Bowman Power collaboration on marine engines, UCL research outputs on waste recovery led to the development of a new marine waste heat recovery unit.  Independent tests at Cranfield University showed that this new system “ *recovers 30% of waste heat thereby improving efficiency in the region of 5%”* **\(S10\)**. It is now being readied for commercial and naval marine markets with ongoing discussions with shipping company Stena.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 ‘A Rounder Sense of Purpose’ \(RSP\) researched and validated a framework of educator competences in Education for Sustainable Development \(ESD\). Beyond influencing hundreds of individuals, strategic impacts include the adoption of the framework by Hungarian and Cypriot Governments within their compulsory teacher professional development programmes. The framework underpins accredited courses in The Netherlands, Italy and England plus training programmes covering Mediterranean states and the Caucuses. It is referenced by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe as a means by which Member States can identify learning outcomes in ESD. The project recently won a prestigious Green Gown Award in the Next Generation Learning and Skills category citing its international impact.

 ‘A Rounder Sense of Purpose’ \(RSP\) adopted a participatory action research approach in order to define and develop an accessible competence framework for educators wishing to support Education for Sustainable Development \(ESD\). The first research phase ran from December 2015 to July 2018 with a second phase running from October 2018 to August 2021. Funded by the European Union Erasmus\+ programme, the total value of both phases is £660,457. 

 The Phase One consortium, convened and led by the University of Gloucestershire, comprised the following members: 

-  Frederick University \(Cyprus\) 

-  Tallinn University \(Estonia\) 

-  Hungarian Research Teachers’ Association \(Hungary\) 

-  Italian Association for Sustainability Science \(Italy\) 

-  Duurzame PABO – a teacher education NGO \(The Netherlands\) 

 Being a participatory research programme, a powerful impact had already been recorded among participating students and teachers during Phase One because of the way in which the framework successfully captured the variety of dimensions of ESD. All consortium members contributed to the main research output \(Vare et al 2019\) recording the process and its findings. By early 2021 this had been cited in 39 peer\-reviewed publications. 

 The research itself began with literature reviews, including close scrutiny of an earlier competence framework, published in 2012 by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe \(UNECE\), which failed to gain widespread support because it had not been tested and therefore remained theoretical as well as overly complex. By contrast, RSP involved several rounds of structured consultation with teachers, NGOs, experts and Government officials, chiefly using a Delphi approach \(i.e. facilitated reflections from a dispersed group of individuals with relevant expertise\) to develop and validate the emerging model. This was followed by cycles of action research in which the model was tested with over 500 educators and student teachers in the six participating countries. In this way the research was bound to register an impact before it reached publication. 

 The resulting framework comprises twelve interrelated competences arranged under three headings: 

 Thinking Holistically: Systems; Attentiveness; Transdisciplinarity; Criticality 

 Envisioning Change: Futures; Empathy; Creativity; Responsibility 

 Achieving Transformation: Participation; Values; Action; Decisiveness 

 Each competence has three learning outcomes and several underpinning components. These are supported by tried and tested teaching activities largely reflecting a constructivist pedagogy. All of this is freely available on the website:  [www.aroundersenseofpurpose.eu](http://www.aroundersenseofpurpose.eu/) 

 Assessment techniques have also been piloted within the project such as self\-reporting and peer assessment. 

 The project has moved into a second phase which focuses on publications with only minor adjustments to the model envisaged as testing continues. The following institutions have joined the Phase Two consortium: 

-  University of Vechta \(Germany\) 

-  Fundació per la Universitat Oberta de Catalunya \(Spain\) 

-  HEP Vaud \(Switzerland\). 

 Further work in this phase means that the website now offers over 200 classroom activities that link the 12 RSP competences with the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. 

 To date the RSP model has been applied in all phases of education as well as non\-formal settings, it has been presented in over ten academic conferences \(in each participating country and beyond\) and has been presented to the steering group of OECD’s Education 2030 programme. The citation accompanying the 2020 Green Gown Award cited the impact of this research both locally and internationally.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Given the participatory nature of this research, impacts on individuals occurred during the research process. More strategically, RSP has provided a number of institutions – and formal education systems – with an accessible framework to guide the promotion and development of education for sustainable development \(ESD\). As a result of this impact the lead researcher, Paul Vare has been invited by the European Commission’s Directorate\-General Education and Culture to join a consultation on developing a conceptual framework for ESD to fulfil the educational aims of the European Green Deal. Throughout the research process itself, hundreds of teachers and non\-formal educators have gained skills, knowledge and confidence in relation to their own ESD practice. Numbers in brackets \(1\) relate to corroborating testimonials/letters and other corroborating sources. 

 Cyprus: The RSP model has been adopted by the Cyprus Pedagogical Institute \(CPI\) for teaching ESD to teachers and school principals with positive impacts on participants \(Zachariou et al 2019\). The Director of the CPI described RSP as “the most appropriate, concrete and friendly model that captures ESD competences in a holistic and unified way.” CPI letter \(1\). 

 Hungary: The Ministry of Human Capacities has used the RSP framework as a model for developing teacher competences in ESD nationally since 2018, evidenced in a letter from the Ministry of Human Capacities inviting the Principle Investigator, Paul Vare, to be keynote speaker at their regional conference\). \(2\) 

 Italy: Teachers and a group of non\-formal educators participated in participatory RSP research\-based courses; both reported highly positive impacts on their understanding and ESD practice. \(3\) The University of Florence piloted the RSP framework in its Degree Course in Science of Education and Training \(Level 6\) in 2017\-18. Evidence of impact on one participant and their subsequent use of RSP in developing an Atlas of Intangible Heritage’ is provided in a testimonial \(4\). 

 The Netherlands: In\-service and pre\-service teachers participated in Phase One RSP courses as part of the participatory research process. Data indicates a profound positive impact on those who took part. A testimonial from Marnix Academie indicates how RSP has been used since the initial research \(5\). 

 England: At the University of Gloucestershire \(UoG\), an annual 13\-week course for Education Level 5 students based entirely on RSP has been running since 2017. 

 This offers a certification scheme as part of students’ Higher Education Achievement Record and follow\-up research. As a result of this experience the UoG primary education team has committed to embedding RSP within their newly validated BEd Primary Education with Qualified Teacher Status at all levels. This provides a model for integrating learning for sustainability within a mainstream teacher education programme as evidenced by a letter from BEd Primary Course Leader at UoG \(6\). 

 Over 100 student teachers have elected to follow the RSP programme; the impact has been profound as evidenced by their reflective journals; analysis of 35 of these by Vare & Millican \(forthcoming\) highlights the following: 

 Increased depth of understanding: 

 ‘As an individual, I have developed new viewpoints based on discussing and involving myself…’ 

 ‘This course is having a huge impact on my overall knowledge and helping me to be more openminded regarding sustainability.’ 

 Deeper levels of reflection: 

 ‘It is making me reconsider things that I do and look at where the things I wear/eat come from and the impact they could have had on the world.’ 

 Positive behaviour change: 

 ‘Myself and other students have set up a ‘green team’ which involves us walking around the local area and removing any litter or tidying up…’ 

 \(All quotes from Level 5 student teachers\) 

 The UNECE Region: The 55 Member States of the United Commission for Europe agreed a Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development in 2005 accompanied by a set of indicators to help Member States monitor progress in implementing the Strategy. In the 2020 version of those indicators, the RSP framework is referenced as “a specific framework to identify learning outcomes in ESD”. \(7\) This follows RSP being selected for presentation at The Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the UNECE Region, Geneva 2019. 

 Armenia: The RSP model was translated into Russian by the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Austria \(BOKU\) for use in teacher training workshops in 2019. It now features in a manual for university lecturers in the Caucasus Region with the entire framework reproduced in the appendix \(8\). 

 The Mediterranean region: In 2019 a new training tool \(curriculum\) was introduced for the European marine education project SEA4ALL; this is based exclusively on the RSP model with translations in Romanian and Greek \(9\). 

 RSP underpins a framework for assessing ESD in Level 7; piloted in London South Bank University, the University of the West Indies and UoG, it has been presented in Swansea, London and Kingston \(Jamaica\) \(10\). 

 Georgia: In April 2019 RSP Principle Investigator, Paul Vare, was invited to speak by the National Centre for Teacher Professional Development to lead a national workshop: ‘Promoting Education for Sustainable Development through TVET in Georgia’; RSP has since been translated into Georgian. 

 Egypt: The RSP model underpins a two\-year national training programme \(2018\-20\) to introduce teachers to ESD. The Egyptian forum for ESD translated it into Arabic. 

 The European Union has cited RSP in its Working Document in preparation for a European Competence Framework on Education for Sustainability.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research and advocacy by Professor Andrew Wilson helped underpin the development of policy planning towards Russia and the six countries of the Eastern Partnership by European Union \( **EU**\) Member States, the EU and other international institutions. Regular closed\-door briefings at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Cabinet Office have informed new UK ambassadors to the region and helped with the drafting of in\-house policy papers. Prof Wilson was asked to brief Prime Minister David Cameron after the revolutionary Maidan events in Ukraine in February 2014. Prof Wilson headed a team of Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe \( **OSCE**\) experts conducting a Needs Assessment Report for the deported peoples in Crimea in 2013\-14. His research and briefings on the Azov Sea crisis were used by the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs \( **MFA**\) in 2018, including during their rotating membership of the UN Security Council, and this has carried forward to their chairing the OSCE. He has been in high demand for analysis and comment during the Belarus crisis in 2020\-1 \(by EU member\-states’ MFAs; UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office; George Marshall Center for Security Studies\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prof Wilson’s work focuses on the post\-Soviet states, looking at both formal and informal politics \(i.e. politics conducted outside the public, official sphere\). There are few functioning democracies in the former USSR, and, contrary to the assumptions of many studies, the explanation lies not in mechanistic application of democratisation theories, but in the machinations of informal politics. His 2005 book, *Virtual Politics* \[ **R1**\], was the first academic study of what Russians call ‘political technology’ – informal practices of political manipulation and media control. Since 2005 such technology has metastasised in Russia, spread to the rest of the former USSR, and above all captured the world’s attention with the launch of ‘hybrid war’ against Ukraine in 2014 and Russian interference in the 2016 US elections and elsewhere in the West. Prof Wilson’s research on Russian manipulation techniques allowed him to predict where problems were likely to arise in 2014 \(Crimea and the Donbas\), and to gauge correctly that most threats to Ukraine were of external Russian origin. 

 In October 2014 he published the first major book on these issues \[ *Ukraine Crisis: What it Means for the West*, **R2**\], based largely on interview evidence and local media sources, and rebutting the prevalent argument that this was a Ukrainian ‘civil war’. These publications \[ **R1**, **R2**\] helped inform the heated academic and policy debate around the Maidan Revolution, the annexation of Crimea, the war in east Ukraine, and sanctions against Russia, plus the impact on the broader region, especially neighbouring states like Belarus, and the spread of Russian ‘political technology’ techniques to the rest of the world. 

 Prof Wilson has also worked on cultural politics, particularly identity issues in the former USSR. When working on Ukraine, he has therefore written frequently on issues of internal cohesion, nationalism and minority politics, all of which came to the fore in 2014. His 2014 article ‘ *The Donbas in 2014: Explaining Civil Conflict Perhaps, but not Civil War*’ \[ **R4**\] based largely on Ukrainian\-language media, examined the interplay of these factors in eastern Ukraine, showing that the ‘Donbas identity’ and alienation from Kyiv were insufficient to account for the war, which arose as a result of Russian interference and its promotion of secessionist local elites. 

 Prof Wilson is one of the world’s leading experts on Belarus. His 2011 book, *Belarus: The Last European Dictatorship* \[ **R4**\], explored Belarus’s complex history and evolving recent identity as an independent nation caught between Russia and the West. Aliaksandr Lukashenka has manipulated the political system to stay in power since 1994 \(as analysed in \[ **R1**\]\) but an evolving nation has outgrown him. The second edition explains how the 2020 protests had their roots in Belarusians’ growing attachment to sovereignty, national identity and democracy \[ **R4**\]. 

 Prof Wilson’s body of research including, including \[ **R1**, **R2**, **R3** and **R4**\] has established his expertise on political technology and public policy throughout the region, contributing to his appointment and continuing role as a Senior Policy Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations \( **ECFR**\). The 2009 establishment of the EU Eastern Partnership policy for the 6 eastern European states of Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan led to enhanced international interest in the region from policymakers, political commentators, and publics: Prof Wilson’s research, in books \[ **R1**, **R2** and **R4**\] consolidated his reputation for expertise amongst these three groups and resulted in his being a recognised commentator on EU and EU Member State policy towards Eastern Europe.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Prof Wilson’s widely\-recognised expertise in the politics of Ukraine, Belarus and the post\-Soviet region more generally \(evidenced in outputs \[ **R1**, **R2**, **R3** and **R4**\]\) enables him to contribute to policy\-making within foreign policy circles. He has pursued an active engagement strategy with influential decision\-makers across Europe, both independently and as a Senior Policy Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations \( **ECFR**\). Prof Wilson has a longstanding relationship with the ECFR, plugging in to policy\-making structures at the national European, EU, Eastern European and transatlantic levels. 

 **Informing the Foreign & Commonwealth Office \(FCO\)** 

 Prof Wilson advises the FCO several times a year at private briefings. The FCO uses these meetings to help shape internal policy papers or brief new officials, such as incoming ambassadors for Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, or officials in London who are briefing ministers. Prof Wilson has frequently been invited to private briefings at the British embassy in Kyiv. In 2017\-19, Prof Wilson was involved in top\-level strategy sessions for the Cabinet Office and FCO on the UK’s policy in Eastern Europe after Brexit. 

 A Deputy Head of Eastern Research Group at the FCO, organises such meetings. He writes that ‘Professor Wilson has had significant impact on HMG policy formation on Eastern Partnership countries and Russia over a number of years’, confirming that he has contributed regularly to ‘briefings, roundtables and brainstormings at senior level with the FCO \(over the last year alone, a roundtable with HMA’s Moscow and Kyiv, a briefing seminar for our HMA\-designate Kyiv and a brainstorming with senior officials on the Eastern Partnership\)’ \( **A**\). Wilson’s ‘insight’ and ‘expertise’ add ‘good value’ while, ‘more broadly \[his\] books are required background reading for officials new to the region’ and his publications ‘are “go to” readings of the highest quality that help to inform HMG. The events that he organises, such as the Annual Conference of Belarusian Studies in the 21st Century \[at UCL SSEES\], are always informative and excellent opportunities to network. We are lucky to have him\!’ \( **A**\) 

 In February 2014 Prof Wilson was in Kyiv at the climax of the Maidan protests. He was asked to write a briefing note for Prime Minister David Cameron for ‘his weekend reading’ box, according to a No. 10 Downing St official \( **B**\), and subsequently gave a private briefing inside No. 10. The UK has been a leading actor in providing diplomatic and security assistance to Ukraine since 2014. 

 **Providing access to research\-led expertise for leading EU policymakers** 

 Prof Wilson also works regularly with EU MFAs and has written briefing papers for the European Parliament. In 2017 Prof Wilson gave a private briefing to the French MFA, just after the election of President Macron, on the Normandy Process \(peace negotiations over Ukraine\), and, again, after the Paris Summit with Ukraine in December 2019. 

 Because of his expertise in ‘political technology’ and Russian techniques for manipulating elections \[detailed in **R1**\], Prof Wilson was part of a private working group advising the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. In 2013 he was asked by the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities to head a research team preparing a Needs Assessment Report on ‘deported peoples’ in Crimea – mainly the Crimean Tatars. The Report was published just before Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and Prof Wilson has continued to brief on human rights abuses under Russian occupation. 

 Prof Wilson has given advice to the United Nations \( **UN**\), notably when they were considering whether and how to become involved as a mediator in the Ukraine protests in 2013\-14. 

 **Eastern Partnership policy** 

 Prof Wilson helped influence the design of the EU’s Eastern Partnership policy in 2008\-09. He then helped shape the debate when the Policy was twice reviewed and upgraded in 2015 and 2018. From 2014, he made the case for bringing forward the EU’s Association Agreements with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, as Russia pressured all three states following the beginning of the war in Ukraine. Prof Wilson has continued to make the case for Western support for Ukraine, given substantial, if patchy, reform progress. The EU and USA have given 20 Billion Euros \(EUR 20,000,000,000\) since 2014, testifying to an upscaling of commitment to Ukraine. 

 Another example is the run\-up to the Eastern Partnership summit in Brussels in November 2017. In connection with this, Prof Wilson was the lead researcher in a FCO\-sponsored project to make the case for continued EU engagement, published on the European Council on Foreign Relations website as ‘Partners for life: Europe’s unanswered ‘Eastern Question’. He toured Europe to discuss it at high\-profile events organised by Member State MFAs and think\-tanks in Paris, Berlin, Madrid \(Esglobal\), Warsaw and Kyiv. The paper was translated into Ukrainian, to encourage dialogue with Ukrainian policy\-makers. The summit \(partly as a result of Wilson’s efforts\) resulted in a renewed EU commitment to Ukraine. Prof Wilson continued to contribute to reviews of the Eastern Partnership policy, focused on its tenth anniversary in 2019. He was invited to Kyiv in June 2020 by the EU Advisory Mission \(a Kyiv\-based group advising on security sector reform\) to review their progress. He has regularly briefed EU Member State MFAs on Ukrainian policy, including France on upgrading its role in the Normandy Format and Minsk Process, and diplomatic dialogue on the war in east Ukraine \(as confirmed in correspondence **C**\). 

 **Belarus** 

 Belarus has faced increased Russian pressure on its sovereignty since 2014. Prof Wilson made the case for selective engagement with Belarus to support its foreign policy diversification strategies, while maintaining a firm line on human rights. Prof Wilson is involved in the new Minsk Dialogue process, a now annual gathering of scholars and experts in Minsk which promotes the visibility of Belarus in international foreign policy discourse. 

 In 2018 he was one of the candidates to be the next UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Belarus \(see invitation letter, **D**\). The outgoing Rapporteur attested that Wilson’s ‘outstanding oeuvre’ would make him ‘eminently qualified’ for the position, and to the research\-informed basis of Wilson’s expertise when commenting that UCL could ‘proudly support \[Wilson\] which is an added benefit both for you and them.’ \( **D**\) 

 In 2019\-20 Prof Wilson wrote papers on Belarus for the US Jamestown Foundation \( **E**\), presented at a workshop for US foreign policy officials in Washington. His paper on the future of the Eastern Neighbourhood for the EU Institute for Security Studies \( **E**\) predicted election fraud and protest in Belarus, as indeed transpired in 2020. Prof Wilson was asked to help draft a strategy paper for the Cabinet Office on Belarus in August 2019. The paper will have gone to the Europe Minister. The Cabinet Office asked Prof Wilson to analyse ‘the trajectory of the relationship’ between Belarus and Russia \( **F**\), and the implications for the UK’s security, trade and business interests in Eastern Europe as a whole. 

 Prof Wilson has briefed the last two UK ambassadors to Minsk, who have played a more active role in opening up trade and political links. Sweden plans more engagement with Belarus during their time as Chair of the OSCE in 2021 and has asked Prof Wilson to provide advice to them in this role. When crisis erupted after the fraudulent elections in August 2020, Prof Wilson did private briefing calls for EU MFAs and the Marshall Center. He spoke at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \( **FCDO**\) ‘Belarus Seminar \- The Way Ahead’ on 25 September 2020, leading up to the UK’s first sanction package outside the EU. \(An email from the FCDO \( **G**\) expresses gratitude for Wilson’s ‘insights’.\) Three online public events were arranged through SSEES. Prof Wilson was widely quoted in UK and world media, including *BBC 4*, *Deutsche Welle*, *Bild*, *Los Angeles Times* and *Le Monde,* and the *New York Times* \(the article ‘Belarus Protests Test Limits of Lukashenko’s Brutal, One\-Man Rule’, published August 24, 2020; circulation of 6,500,000 \[print and digital subscribers\]\) includes reference to \[ **R4**\]: \( **H**\) 

  

 **The Azov Sea Crisis** 

 Prof Wilson’s paper on the Azov Sea crisis \( **I**\) was published before Russia’s blockade created a major international incident in November 2018. It became the third most\-downloaded piece at ECFR that year, and was used as a briefing paper for the meeting of the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Security and Defence \( **SEDE**\) in Brussels in October. Prof Wilson briefed members of the Swedish MFA, when Sweden was then a rotating member of the United Nations Security Council \( **UNSC**\), and held the Presidency in July. According to Prof Wilson’s contact \( **J**\), from the Department for Eastern Europe and Central Asia in the Swedish MFA, ‘We put your report on the Kerch Strait situation in the minister’s folder for the October EaP Ministerial. It was read by our senior management who then asked us to brief them further and follow up. We then began warning about the Sea of Azov in i.a. the UNSC \(30 October\) as well as in various EU meetings. We were also planning a dedicated UNSC Arria meeting on the subject before we were overtaken by events on 25/11’. Sweden will raise the issues of free passage through the Kerch Straits and Russia’s violations of international law again as Chair of the OSCE in 2021. 

 Prof Wilson has continued to speak on the issue, for example at the Annual Conference on Western Responses to Russia in Tartu, Estonia in 2019 and 2020. The issue is far from solved, but when there was a flurry of diplomatic activity in 2018 and the US and EU raised the issue of sanctions against Russia’s North Stream 2 project, there was a noticeable decline in harassment of shipping in the Sea of Azov. The EU Mission to Ukraine has increased its activity, and promised infrastructure investment, in the threatened Azov port city Mariupol. Once again, Prof Wilson is one of a number of influential voices which have helped shape these more interventionist policies.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **De Liddo’s** research on the theories and methods required to harvest the Collective Intelligence \(CI\) of large numbers of people has developed new technologies which public sector organisations, educators, broadcasters and NGOs have used to engage people to participate in decision\-making. Through these tools, **De Liddo’s** work has: 

-  Equipped more than 800 UK Health Visitors with a tool to enhance their professional practice; 

-  Enabled more than 1,300 school and university teachers in Brazil to engage in online collaborative learning; 

-  Promoted citizen engagement with political election debates in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 UK General Elections; 

-  Supported peace building education in Rwanda after the 1994’s genocide. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **De Liddo’s** research explores the socio\-technical theories, methods and tools required to harvest the Collective Intelligence \(CI\) of large numbers of globally distributed people to work together to solve complex societal challenges. Her work creates intuitive, easy to use tools which engage people in useful, unbiased, and democratic conversations that lead to intelligent group behaviours and actions to address critical issues, such as climate change, democratic and health crises. These technologies also produce a wealth of structured data on which De Liddo conducts advanced computational and visual analyses of sensemaking, the process by which people make sense of their collective experience. 

 In a 2012 article **\[O1\]**, **De Liddo** argued that a new type of collective intelligence was necessary to help people collectively to make sense of and co\-create innovative solutions to complex societal challenges, to which there is no single correct answer. This Contested Collective Intelligence \(CCI\) approach enables large scale deliberation between distributed users. It applies advanced computational methods, such as Natural Language Processing and argumentation mining, to structure and analyse online written dialogue between individuals and identify both stated and unstated points of agreement. It creates opportunities for collective sensemaking by enabling people to visualise and reflect on each other’s ideas and arguments. 

  

 **De Liddo** applied the approach to a prototype visual tool, named Cohere, which allowed users to create, mark\-up, connect and share ideas online. Her 2014 publication **\[O2\]** evidenced that i\) showing people a visualisation of their online dialogue and ii\) structuring their interactions through the social process of argumentation, which encourages people to reach conclusions through logical reasoning, could successfully support large scale decision\-making. 

 In a subsequent article **\[O3\]**, **De Liddo** further defined this novel research agenda on deliberation technologies in the field of collective intelligence, establishing a critical set of research challenges, such as “ *summarising the state and content of deliberation to promote engagement and deepen understanding; generating collective creative solutions; and translating proposals into commitments to action*”. 

 Between 2013 and 2015, **De Liddo** led a European Commission\-funded GBP2.25 million CATALYST research programme and a health innovation project funded by the Burdett Trust for Nursing \(200K\) to apply her CCI approach to develop and test three new tools. The first, The Evidence Hub, built on Cohere’s argumentation data model to enable online communities of practice to gather and debate ideas and solutions to specific community issues. The second tool, LiteMap, used collaborative knowledge mapping, web annotation and argumentation technology to enable users to visualise debates online. The tool provides crucial support to brainstorming, creative ideation and idea structuring. Finally, DebateHub directly facilitates group decision\-making by supporting online campaigns. Through these, users collectively propose, debate and select new ideas to tackle open challenges. 

 **De Liddo** continued this research theme during the 2013 to 2016 EPSRC\-funded Election Debate \(EDV\) Visualisation project. The GBP284,000 programme examined how CCI technologies could improve citizen engagement and sensemaking during political elections. 

 EDV produced a novel technology for advanced video replays of televised UK election debates, named Democratic Replay. It also created a new method and interactive tool to harness audience feedback on live political debates at scale, called Democratic Reflection. This interactive web app consists of a grid of coloured flashcards. Each represents a short statement the viewer would like to express during debates, such as “ *This is a strong argument*”, or “ *This is getting interesting, I love this\!*”, or “ *Even if what he says is true I do not trust him*”. Democratic Reflection records, aggregates and automatically analyses users’ feedback to produce personal learning analytics that they can explore at the end of the debate. Research findings from live and lab tests demonstrated these civic technologies’ value in supporting citizens in the complex sensemaking process of political choice. Crucially, they indicate that innovative discourse\-based CI tools are effective instruments to promote critical thinking and shift political opinion **\[O4, O5, O6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Equipping UK’s Health Visitors with a tool to collectively enhance their professional practice** 

 In 2014, the UK’s professional body for health visitors, the Institute of Health Visiting \(iHV\) adopted The Evidence Hub, based on **De Liddo’s** research **\[O1\-O3\]**, to create its e\-Community of Practice Evidence Hub \(HVeCOP\). The platform allows health visitors to raise issues, access a wide variety of resources and discuss practices to improve the children and families’ health. Approximately 776 of the specially\-trained UK nurses and midwives who support young children and their families have since used the tool to systematically capture and harness evidence of good practice **\[C1**, p.3 **\]**. This community has also used the Evidence Hub to discuss 137 issues, propose 76 changes to health visiting practice, share 379 resources and foster a network of 39 organisations **\[C1**, pp.5\-9 **\]**. Writing about the technology on the iHV’s website, health visitors have described the hub as “ *a fantastic resource”,* which provides *“support through a robust and substantive network headed by a small team of Champions from the Institute”* **\[C1**, p.10 **\]**. 

 In a January 2021 letter, a prominent iHV Fellow explained how “ *the EH platform enables a process of evidence\-building to be followed, from posing a question or problem, to discussing the question, providing resources, case examples and sharing scientific papers*”. This, they explain, allows the classification of evidence “ *into topic areas that were instantly relevant to health visitors*” **\[C1**, pp.2\-3 **\]**. The iHV fellow also describes how health visitors could use the software “during an encounter with parents if a question came up that needed shared decision making”, and how it allows them “ *to record their interventions on the platform as CPD \[Continuous Professional Development\]*”. It also creates “ *a mechanism for archiving evidence that could be used to influence policy as well as practice*” **\[C1**, p.3 **\]**. They believe the Evidence Hub “ *has addressed issues of health care and health visiting practice that, in tandem with research and policy development, have led to more open dialogue with service users \(Parents\) and an opportunity to present evidence to public health commissioners*” **\[C1**, p.4 **\]**. 

 An independent evaluation of the tool **\[C2\]** suggests that the hub is also a useful resource that complements agile and paperless working. A health visitor and Evidence Hub user, reflecting on the mobile nature of her working practice, notes that they “ *have now been issued tablets as part of our agile and paperless working future \[…\]. In my future practice in my car or in Tesco as a mobile worker I will no longer have that luxury \[of knowing where my team members are\]. Yes, I could phone my colleagues, but I won't know if they are with a family, on the phone or driving. The evidence hub will be able to fill that void and become my first resource*” **\[C2**, p.438 **\]**. 

 **Enabling online collaborative learning in Brazil** 

 In 2015, the Brazilian open research community, COLEARN, translated **De Liddo’s** LiteMap technology into Portuguese. It drew on her research **\[O1\-O3\]** to build an online network to enable approximately 1,346 schoolteachers and researchers from 5 universities and 319 local schools across Brazil to collaborate and coordinate online course activities **\[C3**, pp.7\-8 **\]**. Using LiteMap, the community advanced many projects, such as encouraging 1,473 learners to coordinate with 36 research educators to develop collaborative knowledge maps about genetically modified foods **\[C4**, p.42 **\]**. It also used the LiteMap tool for undergraduate\-led inquiry and professional development of teaching staff. In feedback collected during a European project with the same community, called ENGAGE, teachers acknowledged “ *the discussion supported by technologies increased students’ participation*”. They also noted that the “ *tasks introduced helped students generate more questions and arguments, resulting in very reflective interaction in the classroom*” **\[C4**, p.43 **\]**. A comprehensive review of the ENGAGE project demonstrated that **De Liddo’s** LiteMap technology improved collaborative online learning experiences by enabling the systematic gathering, mapping and visualisation of individual students’ contributions to various online dialogues **\[C3\]**. For instance, students used LiteMap to share questions, ideas, arguments, counterarguments, data and facts, to systematise their evidence\-based opinions about reducing the Zika virus. Litemap also increased students’ awareness of both Zika’s spread and the importance of fostering scientific literacy **\[C3**, p.11 **\]**. The review shows that LiteMap was successfully used alongside mainstream social media tools such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and Hangout, to promote Responsible Research and Innovation \(RRI\) through open education, and fostered the second largest community of RRI adopters in Brazil, after Facebook **\[C3**, table 2, p.8 **\]**. 

 **Promoting citizen engagement in political election debates in the UK** 

 One of the UK’s leading broadcasters, ITV, trialled the Democratic Reflection tool **\[O4, O5\]** with a representative panel of 242 UK voters, during its 2<sup>nd</sup> April 2015 televised debate between all seven UK political party leaders, ahead of that year’s 7<sup>th</sup> May general election **\[C5\]**. In feedback collected during the trial, these panel members either agreed or strongly agreed that the tool made them “ *really focus on the debate*” \(79.8%\) **\[C6**, p.13 **\]**. Crucially, 56% also agreed that the experience with Democratic Reflection defined how “ *they would like to be involved in political election debates in the future*” **\[C6**, p.17 **\]**. ITV repeated the exercise during leaders debates before the June 2017 and December 2019 UK general elections **\[C7\]**. Citizens who used the technology during the 2017 elections said that the platform’s personal analytics altered how they looked at specific political leaders: "" *I came into this group more or less decided on what I was going to vote for, but the statistics completely changed my mind, so that helped""; “When I came in I was a conservative. But my analytics showed Jeremy Corbyn on top, I was so surprised\!”; “To someone who's really undecided on who to vote for, it is quite interesting to see what my reactions were \[…\] I was a bit like oh, right. Okay, so obviously I agree with what they're saying. Maybe I need to go back and look at their manifesto and read it all through again”* **\[C8\]**. Meanwhile, approximately 70% of the 69\-strong undecided UK voters who took part in 2019 agreed that Democratic Reflection “ *helped them reflect on the debate in a deeper way*” and 65% agreed that watching the debate with the tool “ *changed some initial assumptions they had before the debate*” **\[C6**, pp.31\-32 **\]**. 

 **Supporting peace education in Rwanda** 

 In March 2019, UK\-based NGO, The Aegis Trust, which works on the prevention of genocide and mass atrocities worldwide, used the Democratic Reflection tool **\[O4, O5\]** to engage a community of 50 teachers and young people. Part of the Isôoko project, which uses digital technologies to support peace education, the initiative encouraged participants to actively listen and reflect on a video, called “Ubumuntu”, which tells a range of stories that relate to the 1994 Tutsi genocide in Rwanda. Democratic Reflection helped users connect to the accounts personally and challenge their prior assumptions **\[C9**, p.2 **\]**. 

 In a December 2019 interview with **De Liddo**, the Aegis Trust Digital Resources and Comms Manager for Rwanda explained how Democratic Reflection gave the trust “ *the power of knowing what's going on in the people they train*” **\[C10**, p. 4, line 1 **\]**. They describe it as a tool to “ *increase value in terms of engagement*” with peace building efforts, which “ *gives content producers the possibility of learning from people who are actually using their content”* **\[C10**, p.2, last paragraph; p.3, line 9 **\]**.  Speaking of the tool’s role in peace education, they noted “ *you can only achieve \[peace education\] if individually people are connected, and people are really reflecting on their role in society. That is something Democratic Reflection \[…\] was really promoting”* **\[C10**, p.5, line 11 **\]**. They also reported very positive feedback from both parents and young people. Young people in particular recognized the tool’s capability to promote reflection and capture emotional reactions **\[C10**, p. 4, last paragraph; p.5, second paragraph **\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Forecasting is a crucial activity at all central banks. It both informs policymakers on the direction of the economy when making decisions, and allows them to measure the effectiveness of their policies. Policymakers at central banks have relied on conventional time\-varying econometric methods for their forecasting analyses. However, they have found them unwieldy, computationally demanding and misaligned with economic policy because they do not account for the ever\-changing nature of economic data. To address these challenges, King’s Business School researchers have partnered with analysts at the Bank of England and the European Central Bank to create an innovative time\-varying estimation model that utilises rolling data. The new model has been successfully adopted by both banks, leading to more robust modelling efforts, improved policy analyses and strengthened analytical skills of their staff. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The economy is in constant transformation: new technologies, products, jobs and businesses appear continuously, and new policies and institutional arrangements arise to accommodate them. As a result, the types of economic data and the methods needed to interrogate them change in fundamental ways. In this context of constant transformation, statistical analysis of the economy requires a more dynamic approach to data capture and demands improved statistical methods that can interpret rapid change in the characteristics of key economic variables such as averages and variances. Economists must address this fundamental feature of economic data, given that failure to do so could lead to catastrophic problems such as the inability to forecast efficiently. Most forecast failures in economics – and there have been many such instances, most notably the unexpected 2008 financial crisis – can \(in part\) be attributed to forecasting methodologies not adequately accounting for rapidly changing data. 

 The response has been to use models that can account for changes over time, referred to as ‘time\-varying models’. Conventional models of this sort involve some form of rolling averaging of the data. The problem, however, is that such models are insufficiently flexible to the effects of exogenous and random shocks. This makes them increasingly unsuitable to the current economic context, characterized by drastic and unpredictable changes wrought by events such as Brexit and the COVID\-19 pandemic, for example. 

 Building on a close partnership with the Bank of England, King’s researchers developed and refined an alternative ‘time\-varying model’ that addresses the analytical and practical shortcomings of conventional models used by many central banks to forecast economic change. The new model requires minimal computational costs because it can be incorporated into existing systems \[1\]. 

 In developing this new time\-varying model, King’s research has made significant contributions to knowledge: crucially, introducing a new model that allows for exogenous shocks to drive change, which was not possible using conventional models. In particular, the new model deploys non\-parametric estimation techniques instead of the conventional ‘Bayesian statistics’ \[1,2,3\]. The advantage is that non\-parametric estimation techniques enable the incorporation of realistic assumptions about the sources of change in the economy. Specifically, they allow the change to have random elements and to be driven by sudden shocks. This enables, for example, the estimation of the degree to which financial shocks are transmitted to core variables of GDP and inflation \[3\], as well as the implications of a change in monetary policy \[3,4\]. The new model also provides inference \(statistical testing and construction of confidence intervals\) for forecasted estimates of output growth and inflation \[2,5\]. 

 Perhaps the most important contribution of this research is the wide applicability and ease of use for the proposed class of methods. For example, in recent work, the method has been applied to big data \[4\] as well as machine learning models such as deep neural net \(deep learning\) models. Put simply, the method is adaptable because it is a refinement of rolling windows; as a result, it is easy to incorporate into most forms of modelling and, because it is possible to provide an underpinning for its desirable theoretical properties, it can be justifiably used widely.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Central banks are increasingly concerned about the effects of structural changes such as those caused by Brexit, new digital technologies, or COVID\-19, on the validity of models used for economic policy making and forecasting. This concern spans all kinds of models: from statistical models mainly used for forecasting to structural economic models used for narrative analyses of the evolution of the UK and world economy. Researchers from King’s Business School have collaborated with analysts at the Bank of England and the European Central Bank \(ECB\) to produce a new model that resolves the problems associated with ‘time variation’ in economic data \[A\]. The new model has been successfully adopted by the two central banks, improving their analytical capability and leading to more robust policy decisions. 

#  Developing a new forecasting model for the Bank of England 

 Over the past 18 years, King’s Business School Professor George Kapetanios has collaborated with the Bank of England on multiple projects, resulting in a profound impact on the work of several of its divisions. First and foremost, the modelling techniques co\-developed by Kapetanios and colleagues at the Bank \[4, A\] have been formally implemented into the Bank’s computational processes used in its forecasting platform. The recommended time\-varying modelling techniques have been used by various teams to produce models and analyses that have informed the Bank’s policy decisions, taken by members of the Monetary Policy Committee \(MPC\). 

 Francesca Monti, former Head of Modelling in the Monetary Analysis Directorate, explains that the new model co\-developed by King’s and Bank of England colleagues “ *has been used to discuss various issues with the MPC, and particularly has been used to weigh in on the debate about the exchange rate pass\-through, that is how exchange rate movements first affect import prices and then overall inflation, and how it has changed in time, with a rich structural model*” \[B\]. King’s research contribution to understanding how exchange rates feed into inflation has been particularly significant in light of the 2016 Brexit referendum, which has increased exchange rate volatility and is presumed to change the UK's trade relations in a permanent way. 

 Additionally, in September 2019, when uncertainty about the Brexit deal was rife, the Modelling Team at the Bank of England used the newly developed time\-varying estimation techniques \[2\] to inform the MPC on the impact of macro\-economic and financial uncertainty on the UK economy. Dr Monti explains that “ *the model was able to disentangle the differential effects of the two types of uncertainty on key macroeconomic variables, such as GDP, inflation and other macroaggregates. It also gave very interesting insights on how the two types of uncertainty have affected the economy in different time periods*” \[B\]. 

 The new model \[4\] also informed the speech given by Bank of England Chief Economist, Andrew Haldane, at the 2018 Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium, Jackson Hole, Wyoming \[C\]. As the highest profile central banking conference in the world, the event brings together central bankers, financial market participants, government representatives, academics and news media to discuss long\-term policy issues of mutual concern. In his speech on ‘Market Power and Monetary Policy’ Haldane specifically cited the King’s research \[4\] when discussing the lower incidence of mark\-up shocks. Using the King’s finding that over the last few decades the estimate of mark\-up shock volatility in the UK economy has decreased, the research contributed to the discussion of developments in product markets and monetary policy. This finding has, in particular, important implications for the variability of inflation and hence the MPC’s ability to meet the inflation target. Ricardo Masolo, Research Manager of the Monetary Policy Outlook Division, explains that “ *to the best of \[his\] knowledge no similar evidence was available for the UK”* prior to Kapetanios’ model \[D\]. 

#  Improving the ECB’s modelling efforts and policy analysis 

 King’s research has also provided the ECB with useful tools for policy analysis, steering their internal policy work. This was enabled by Professor Kapetanios’ formal involvement as a consultant and by his frequent presentations at the ECB, including at the ECB Workshop on Forecasting Techniques and at the Working Group on Econometric Modelling in 2018. Under his direct guidance, many internal tools were produced to support the ECB staff with their economic monitoring and forecasting efforts. 

 Gonzalo Camba\-Mendez, Senior Lead Financial Risk Expert at ECB, confirms that “ *the work of Kapetanios provided us with more efficient reduced\-form models for forecasting, as well as with more robust tools to analyse the monetary policy transmission mechanism*” \[E\]. For the ECB, it was especially important to identify a more robust model because of the profound structural changes affecting the world economy, including those caused by globalisation, deregulation and the widespread use of information technologies, which have altered the transmission of monetary policy shocks. The new model \[3\] significantly helped the ECB adapt its economic estimates with respect to this changing environment. In fact, his contributions “ *have been an important reference when setting up internal tools for the economic monitoring and forecasting of euro area macroeconomic developments. Many of those internal tools were developed under his direct guidance and leadership”* \[E\]. His recent work on modelling time\-varying volatility \[4\] has also informed internal ECB tools to monitor and measure market risk. 

 The King’s research collaboration has not only helped the ECB set up new policy tools, but also improved the analytical skills of the ECB staff. In fact, as reported by Camba\-Mendez, “ *Our cooperation with professor Kapetanios not only allowed us to quickly set\-up tools for our regular economic and policy analysis, but has also been very important for strengthening the analytical skills of our ECB staff…his* *availability for some informal exchanges on his method has already provided us with very valuable information, and we very much look forward to future cooperation with Professor Kapetanios in this, as well as in many other areas of financial modelling where his expertise is very valuable to us*” \[E\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Health Behaviour of School\-aged Children \(HBSC\) WHO collaborative cross\-national survey conducted at St Andrews has been used extensively to prioritise policies, to reduce gender and socio\-economic inequalities and to improve health: 

-  **Identifying health priorities and informing policy development at national level** \- HBSC findings have informed Scottish Government annual policy reports for the *Child Poverty Strategy for Scotland 2016* and the *Pregnancy and Parenthood in Young People’s Strategy between 2016 and 2026.* 

-  **Supporting strategic monitoring of adolescent health within Europe \-** HBSC targets and indicators have been adopted by 53 member countries in this area through the WHO’s *Investing in children: European Child and Adolescent Health Strategy between 2015 and 2020.* 

-  **Monitoring and promoting adolescent health at international level \-** UNICEF used HBSC data to raise the profile of adolescent health globally and address key adolescent issues including sexual health, obesity, alcohol use, poverty and mental health. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The School of Medicine hosted the HBSC International Coordinating Centre \(ICC\) between 2011 and 2019, led by Prof. **C.** **Currie** until 2015 and by Dr **Inchley** as International Coordinator and **D.** **Currie** as Deputy International Coordinator from 2015 onwards. The ICC oversees the work of the  [HBSC](http://www.hbsc.org/) international research network of over 400 researchers, leads the scientific and methodological development of the study, and coordinates stakeholder engagement, policy\-related outputs and knowledge exchange activities. 

 [HBSC](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/child-and-adolescent-health/health-behaviour-in-school-aged-children-hbsc/about-hbsc), led by researchers at the University of St Andrews, is the largest cross\-national study of adolescent health and wellbeing in Europe and aims to increase understanding of adolescent health with a key focus on social determinants of health. Conducted in collaboration with the World Health Organisation \(WHO\), it involves 50 member countries and regions across Europe and North America as of 2019. Surveys conducted every 4 years provide data for national and international agencies to support the development and implementation of strategies to improve the health of young people and address health inequalities \(R1\). 

  

 Over 400,000 young people participated in the two most recent HBSC surveys \(between 2013/14 and 2017/18\). Cross\-national findings show high levels of life satisfaction and recent improvements, notably in a reduction in substance use and soft drink consumption \(R1, R2\). Overall, younger adolescents report high levels of social support from family, friends and classmates, but this decreases with age \(R1\). Key challenges are low levels of physical activity, with less than 25% of adolescents meeting the WHO guidelines \(R2\), and increasing prevalence of poor mental well\-being, especially among older adolescent girls \(R1\). Marked gender inequalities exist for many health indicators, such as eating behaviours, which often increase with age \(R1, R3\). There are clear social inequalities, with young people from less affluent families doing worse on a wide range of outcomes, including general health, life satisfaction, mental health, oral health, soft drink consumption and screen time \(R1, R2, R4, R6\). Our research has shown that exposure to socio\-economic inequality, particularly in early childhood plays a major role in explaining health differences in adolescence \(R4, R5\). 

 In Scotland, levels of drunkenness and early sexual initiation are high relative to most other European countries \(R1, R3\). Screen time has been increasing rapidly, with associated high levels of sedentary behaviour, increased exposure to cyberbullying and higher risks of poor mental well\-being. Poor mental health has emerged from our work as a pressing public health concern for young people. Our research has shown that Scotland has some of the highest levels of socio\-economic related inequalities in health, which are closely related to less optimal parental communication, lower fruit consumption, higher soft drink consumption, higher screen\-time, tobacco and cannabis use \(boys only\), higher psychosomatic health complaints and lower self\-rated health \(R1, R2\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Adolescent health is a global public health concern, with increasing recognition of the importance of the second decade of life as a critical stage of development. Adolescents now make up 16.6% of the world’s population, the largest population of adolescents in human history, and account for 6% of the global burden of disease and injury. More than 3,000 people \(adolescents\) die every day from largely preventable causes. 

 The work led by the research team at St Andrews has built the evidence base by furthering the understanding of the status and determinants of adolescent health; it has contributed to monitoring and evaluation by creation and use of HBSC indicators to measure change over time against national targets for health behaviours and outcomes; and it has implemented health improvement activities through policy and strategy development at national and international levels \(R1\-R6\). 

 Under the leadership of Prof. C Currie and Prof. Humphris, the School of Medicine achieved the distinction of hosting the designated WHO Collaborating Centre \(WHO CC\) for International Child and Adolescent Health Policy in 2014. All European WHO CCs meet annually to work with WHO developing strategy for the Region, including adopting major HBSC findings to indicate new intervention priorities and policy changes \(S1\). The HBSC ICC and WHO CC work with national governments and international bodies \(WHO, UNICEF, OECD, Eurochild, the EC, Schools for Health in Europe Network \(SHE\), and Excellence in Paediatrics\) to ensure our research shapes and supports international agendas targeting adolescent health \(S1, S2\). 

 Through its varied outputs \(national reports \(R3\), international reports \(R1, R2 and R6\), scientific papers \(R4, R5\), policy briefs and activities, the HBSC study, under the leadership of St Andrews, has achieved widespread reach through the Scottish, UK, and international media \(e.g. widespread international media coverage following publication of R1 reached  more than 26 countries, via national TV and radio, the  [Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30004-6/fulltext),   [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/15/british-teenagers-among-least-satisfied-in-western-world) \(print circulation 168,000 in 2016\),  [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/12194857/Lad-culture-How-British-teenage-girls-outdo-boys-for-sex-and-drunkenness.html),  [the Sun](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3SLpfvg60_uaFJTR3E2NHhaWlk/view) \(print circulation 1,800,000 in 2016\),  [Independent](autorehttps://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/7-charts-show-countries-highest-number-teenage-cannabis-smokers-a6932261.htmlcovery%20save%20of%20IR%202020%20reflections%20for%20next%20time%20%20rough.asd.docx), Newsweek,  [TES](https://www.tes.com/news/state-pupils-mental-health-shames-us-all), der Standard,  [Yahoo.com News \(US\)](https://www.yahoo.com/news/youth-well-off-nations-smoke-drink-less-2010-092056430.html) \(current average 251,000,000 per month visits\) and over 270 more online sources \(S3\). Inchley was interviewed for  [BBC Health Check](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03lyvnn) and a  [<ins>BMJ podcast</ins>](https://soundcloud.com/bmjpodcasts/uk-children-are-drinking-less-and-the-importance-of-a-publicly-provided-nhs)\). By providing expert advice, St Andrews researchers brought the health needs and priorities of adolescents in Scotland and beyond to the attention of a diverse range of stakeholders. 

 **Identifying health priorities and informing policy development at national level** 

 Findings from the HBSC Scotland and HBSC International reports 2014 \(R1, R3\) were used by the Scottish Government to inform the following policy: 

-  The Annual Reports for the Child Poverty Strategy for Scotland 2014 and 2016 \(S4\) where HBSC findings are included as part of strategic measurement of policy progress. 

-  This was also used by the SG as evidence review on poverty and inequality \(S5\), where HBSC data is used as key evidence base. 

-  SG’s *Pregnancy and Parenthood in Young People’s Strategy 2016\-2026* \(S6\) where HBSC evidence provided the only source of internationally comparable data on sexual behaviour among Scottish adolescents. 

 As well as being widely reported in the media, the HBSC research has been highlighted by politicians as a key policy resource. “ *Your research is important for a number of different reasons….. it provides us with a barometer against which we can broadly measure the success of policies which aim to improve the health and well\-being of Scotland’s Young people. It also shows us where the challenges remain”.* Scottish Minister for Children and Young People 2011\-2016. \(S2, p. 2\). 

 **Supporting strategic monitoring of adolescent health within the European Region** 

 Indicators for children's health and well\-being \(R1 & R2\) are available to a wide range of stakeholders from the  [WHO Health Information Gateway](https://gateway.euro.who.int/en/data-sources/hbsc/). Our findings from HBSC have been used to contribute to a WHO report  [Review of social determinants and the health divide in the  [WHO European Region: final report \(2013\)](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/251878/Review-of-social-determinants-and-the-health-divide-in-the-WHO-European-Region-FINAL-REPORT.pdf)](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/251878/Review-of-social-determinants-and-the-health-divide-in-the-WHO-European-Region-FINAL-REPORT.pdf) \(S7\) and  [*Investing in Children: the European Child and Adolescent Health Strategy, 2015\-2020*](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/253729/64wd12e_InvestCAHstrategy_140440.pdf) \(S8\) . 

 HBSC data \(R1\) is extensively cited in two WHO publications: in 2018:  [*Situation of child and adolescent health in Europe*](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/381139/situation-child-adolescent-health-eng.pdf)  and, in 2019,  [*Adolescent Health and Development in the WHO European Region: Can we do better?*](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/407219/AA-HA-adaptation-V7_maket_10.07.19_e_book_2.pdf) ; several HBSC indicators have been adopted by WHO, and ratified by the 53 ER countries, as key indicators for monitoring of health within the European Region \( [Targets and indicators for Health 2020](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/378945/Targets4_EN_WEB.pdf)\) \(S9\), and many more are used by WHO to provide monitoring data and online country profiles thought the  [WHO European Health Information Gateway resource](https://gateway.euro.who.int/en/datasets/cah/). The latest WHO report monitoring the key health indicators of health across the European Region <ins>‘</ins> [European Health Report 2018](https://www.euro.who.int/en/data-and-evidence/european-health-report/european-health-report-2018)<ins>’</ins> <ins>also</ins> includes HBSC indicators \(S10\). 

 Through international reports \(R1, R2, R6\), we have raised the profile of adolescent health globally \(for example, R1 is the most downloaded report from the WHO Euro website \(at least 30,000 downloads as of November 2020\)\). The HBSC surveys and research have provided a unique data source to inform policy and practice across Europe, and this has been recognised as *“a pioneer cross\-national study and an invaluable resource for over 25 years, providing insights into young people’s well\-being, health behaviours and social context. Its findings have been used by WHO and many others to inform policy and practice in countries and regions across Europe, undoubtedly contributing to improvements in the lives of millions of young people”* as written by the Director of the Division of Noncommunicable Diseases and Life\-course, WHO Regional Office for Europe. \(S11\) 

 **Monitoring and promoting adolescent health at international level** 

 Research undertaken by UNICEF, including data from HBSC research \(R1\) has contributed to international debate around inequalities in adolescent health. HBSC data are included in report cards published by UNICEF, Innocenti Report Card 16:  [Worlds of Influence Understanding What Shapes Child Well\-being in Rich Countries](https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/Report-Card-16-Worlds-of-Influence-child-wellbeing.pdf) \(2020\) \(S12\) and C **Currie** and D **Currie** were members of the International Steering Group for Innocenti Report Card 13:  [Fairness for Children: A league table of inequality in child well\-being in rich countries](https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/RC13_eng.pdf) \(2016\) and Innocenti Report Card 14:  [Building the Future: Children and the Sustainable Development Goals in Rich Countries](https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/RC14_eng.pdf) \(2017\). These Reports Cards have raised the profile of adolescent health globally and address key adolescent issues including sexual health, obesity, alcohol use, poverty and mental health, and provide evidence that UNICEF has used to lobby governments internationally to promote adolescent health.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Hydrogen Safety Engineering and Research \(HySAFER\) Centre’s research addressed key knowledge gaps and technological bottlenecks in the safety of hydrogen technologies. The research has informed science\-based Regulations, Codes and Standards \(RCS\), supporting deployment of technologies by providing the technical requirements to achieve safety. The impact is the adoption of Ulster research into international RCS. Specifically, HySAFER research has: 

1.  Informed International RCS through activities of Working Groups \(WGs\) of UN GTR\#13/IWG/SGS, CEN/CENELEC/JTC6 and ISO/TC197. 

1.  Supported deployment of hydrogen technologies through provision of safety guidance: European Guidelines on Fuel Cell Indoor Installation and Use; European Model Evaluation Protocol; and the European Emergency Response Guide. 

1.  Provided novel engineering tools of the e\-laboratory in Hydrogen Safety for stakeholders. 

1.  Devised design of innovative fire test protocol, invented breakthrough safety technology. 

1.  Impacted European funding priorities. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 HySAFER studies described in the seminal work by Molkov \(2012, **R2**\) **,** have been built upon research which began in 2000 and 30 externally funded projects in the area of hydrogen safety \(e.g. **G1** 2012\-15 **, G2** 2013\-18\). These include but are not limited to: the similarity law \(Molkov, **R2**\), the pressure peaking phenomenon \(PPP\) \(Brennan/Molkov/Makarov/Shentsov\), correlations for vented deflagrations including non\-uniform and localised mixtures \(Molkov/Makarov\), dimensionless jet\-flame length correlation \(Molkov, **R2**\), hydrogen inventory limit for a warehouse\-like space \(Makarov/Molkov\) and passive ventilation theory \(Molkov/Shentsov, **R1**\). 

 Key knowledge gaps have been addressed including a contemporary computational fluid dynamics \(CFD\) model for dynamics of blast wave and fireball after hydrogen tank rupture in a fire in the open atmosphere, most recently published \(Molkov/Cirrone/Shentsov/Makarov, **R6**\), a reduced model \(Makarov/Shentsov/Molkov\) and a CFD model for the PPP for jet fires \(Brennan/Hussein/Makarov/Shentsov/Molkov, **R5**\). Considerable work has been completed to understand the behaviour of a high\-pressure tank in a fire; this has included a conjugate heat transfer CFD model and theoretical blast wave decay theory. The study on thermally protected tanks is completed \(Makarov/Kashkarov/Molkov, **R4**\). The *significance* and *reach* of the HySAFER research is in breakthrough safety strategies and innovative engineering solutions, e.g. explosion free in a fire composite tank without thermally activated pressure relief device \(TPRD\) as per EU patent application No.18706224.5 dated 05/09/19, which are utilised by stakeholders globally. External grants \(Section 3\) amalgamating research, education/training, and outreach activities underpin the significance, rigour and originality of the research to inform international RCS \( **I1**\). 

 Hazard distances from hydrogen systems have cost implications arising from land values. Before Ulster work, no validated models existed to estimate hazard distances from a fireball and blast wave following rupture of storage vessels at pressures up to 100 Megapascals \(MPa\) in a fire.  It was demonstrated for the first time in 2015 \(Molkov/Kashkarov\) and confirmed recently by detailed numerical study \(Molkov/Cirrone/Shentsov/Makarov, **R6**\) that the assessment of hazard distances must account for contribution of hydrogen combustion at contact surface to the blast wave strength. This research paved the way to understanding of a slow decay of blast wave and unacceptably high velocity of fireball propagation, which led to the HyTunnel\-CS funding \( **G5** 2019\-22\). Research on IP\-protected breakthrough safety technology on explosion free in a fire TPRD\-less tanks \( **G2** 2013\-18 **, G3** 2017\-19\) with industrial partners Hexagon\-Lincoln \(USA\), Sherwin\-Williams \(UK\), Pro\-Science \(Germany\), Optimum CT \(USA\) and Authorised Testing \(USA\) solved the problem of devastating consequences after tank rupture in a fire \(including blast wave, fireball, projectiles\). The use of two composites in the load\-bearing wall with properties defined by Intellectual Property allows the hydrogen\-impermeable liner to melt and start release of hydrogen in a form of microleaks through the wall before tank rupture. This multi\-disciplinary inter\-sectoral study highlighted the importance of the revealed tank failure mechanism in fire and led to the breakthrough leak\-no\-burst safety technology for hydrogen storage composite tanks for onboard and stationary applications \( **I4**\). Three different series of prototypes of TPRD\-less tanks were successfully manufactured and tested in the USA. At the same time the influence of specific heat release rate on fire resistance rating and test reproducibility in different laboratories was discovered, underlining the need for change in the fire test protocol of the Global technical regulation on hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles \(GTR\#13\) \( **I1**\). 

 Ulster with Maryland \(USA\) developed passive ventilation theory, enhancing safety by correcting previous faulty engineering methodology which either underestimated hydrogen concentration in air twice for lean mixtures or overestimated twice for rich mixtures \(Molkov/Shentsov, **R1**\). 

 Previous research demonstrated that structural integrity can be compromised by PPP \(Brennan/Molkov, **R2**\). Recently the PPP for experimental ignited releases has been investigated theoretically and numerically, and highlighted safety concerns in high\-pressure storage previously considered “safe”. The numerical study \(Brennan/ Shentsov/ Makarov/Molkov, **R5**\) gave insights into the phenomenon. Recommendations to improve the technology have been realised by OEMs, e.g. Daimler and Toyota reduced their TPRD diameter to 2mm. The requirement to address the PPP is implemented in ISO standards \( **I1**\), and an engineering tool of e\-Laboratory to predict overpressure during an ignited release was developed \( **G4** 2017\-2021\). 

 Localised vented deflagrations and their mitigation techniques were not studied until recently \(Makarov/Molkov **, R3**\). The theoretical model was developed and validated against HSE \(UK\) and KIT \(Germany\) experiments. The study revealed that only a fast\-burning fraction of non\-uniform flammable mixture contributes to the maximum vented deflagration overpressure. Ulster’s unique CFD deflagration model is used by industry and academia in Canada, Greece, Japan, Poland, and UK \(Shell\) \( **I3**\) informing safe design of Fuel Cell and Hydrogen \(FCH\) systems and infrastructure. A thermodynamic model for deflagration overpressure in closed space such as a warehouse was developed and validated which shows that hydrogen inventory in an enclosure without vents should not exceed the amount that, when divided by the enclosure volume, gives an average volumetric concentration below 0.3% by volume \(Makarov/Molkov, **R3**\), i.e. far below the lower flammability limit of 4% by volume.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The significance of the research is through informing RCS including UN ECE GTR\#13, ISO and EU standards and pan\-European guidance documents. The research also underpinned the development of the e\-Laboratory of Hydrogen Safety, composed mainly of Ulster’s models/tools, impacted upon funding priorities in hydrogen safety research. 

 **I1: Informed international science\-based RCS** 

 CEN/CENELEC/JTC6 Hydrogen in Energy Systems \(WG3 Hydrogen Safety\) suggested in June 2020 a New Work Item Proposal “Safe use of hydrogen in built constructions” based on HyIndoor \( **G1**\) and HyTunnel\-CS \( **G5**\) project outcomes. The importance of Ulster’s work is evidenced by the CEN/CENELEC/JTC6 secretariat \( **C1**\) who confirms they *“have seen the clear impact of the pre\-normative research \(PNR\) work carried out at HySAFER of Ulster University on standard development”* *… “The PNR outputs of the HySAFER\-led project HyTunnel\-CS are directly informing standard development”.* 

 International standard ISO 19880\-1 “Gaseous hydrogen \- Fuelling stations \- Part 1: General requirements” uses the HySAFER’s term “hazard distance” which is deterministic and can be calculated by Ulster’s tools. This standard recommends “thermal shielding” for storage vessels based on the underpinning research at HySAFER on vehicle tanks \( **G2** 2013\-18 **, G3** 2017\-19\). ISO 19882 “Gaseous hydrogen land vehicle fuel tanks and TPRDs” has drastically changed requirements for ventilation systems. It now requires accounting for the PPP discovered at Ulster. ISO/TR 15916:2015 “Basic considerations for the safety of hydrogen systems” cites the seminal book by Molkov \( **R2**\) as a key reference. The “ *strong*” impact of HySAFER research on ISO standards, and development of inherently safer hydrogen systems, is acknowledged by the Chairperson of ISO/TC197 \( **C3**\) who notes the *“outstanding research work carried out at HySAFER, in particular on models and tools for assessment of hazard distances, the pressure peaking phenomenon, and safety of storage tanks has been incorporated into publicly accessible safety documentation*”. This is echoed by the Chair of Hydrogen Europe RCS Strategy Coordination Group who confirms the impact HySAFER research has had on RCS globally **\(C2\).** 

 The GTR\#13 \(Phase 2\) accounts for Ulster’s contributions to the fire test protocol. The control of specific heat release rate in a fire source \(HRR/A\) has led to drastically improved fire test reproducibility. HySAFER research on the significance of HRR/A is publicly accessible through the GTR Informal Working Group, Sub\-Group Safety **\(C4\).** The significance of the GTR\#13 stems from its EU\-wide legally binding status. 

 These documents facilitate the safer deployment of hydrogen vehicles and refuelling infrastructure, improve testing procedures, and impact OEMs worldwide. They are used by the hydrogen industry with a global reach and its significance is in setting the benchmark for the safety of hydrogen\-powered vehicles. 

 **I2: Industry\-relevant guidance** 

 HySAFER has provided technical safety requirements through industry\-relevant guidance: European Guidelines on Fuel Cell Indoor Installation and Use; European Model Evaluation Protocol; and European Emergency Response Guide. 

 Collaboration with Air Liquide \(France\) and partners within the HyIndoor project \( **G1** 2012\-2015\) resulted in industry\-led European Guidelines \( **C5**\). Ulster’s engineering models/tools are presented in the Guidelines including: design of ventilation systems, mitigation of deflagrations in enclosures by limitation of hydrogen inventory, recommendations for vent sizing of enclosures fully and partially filled in by hydrogen\-air mixtures, and effect of flow restrictors. The Guidelines’ importance is highlighted by a senior scientist at Air Liquide \( **C6**\) who notes the *“industry\-led guidelines have impact upon hydrogen safety engineering worldwide and assist in underpinning the safe deployment of hydrogen infrastructure”*. The significance of the guidance is in providing a compendium of information with a reach across a variety of stakeholders. 

 Ulster made a substantial technical contribution to the “European Emergency Response Guide \(EERG\)” led by the French Fire Academy \(ENSOSP\). It incorporates HySAFER’s tools for the prediction of hazard distances of unignited release, flame length, blast wave and fireball. This guide is used by emergency response personnel globally, its value is corroborated by the Lead of Training at ENSOSP \( **C7**\) who states how “ *through HyResponse ENSOSP are recognised as the leading providers of hydrogen safety training for responders in Europe, our unique operational training is complemented by the research\-led educational training provided by Ulster University. The current Ulster led HyResponder project is enabling us to maximise the reach and impact of our training and update EERG by new research findings and use of the online e\-Laboratory of Hydrogen Safety created mainly on the basis of models developed and validated at HySAFER”*. 

 **I3: Unique engineering tools** 

 The e\-Laboratory of Hydrogen Safety incorporates numerous engineering tools based on Ulster’s publications. The e\-Laboratory developed within the NET\-Tools project beginning in 2017 \( **G4**\) is freely available online to stakeholders around the globe. Specific examples of how the tools have impact include: prevention of destruction of civil structures through limitation of the PPP, and calculation of hazard distances. The e\-Laboratory has been recognised by the EC's Innovation Radar as a Key Innovation, “ *addressing the needs of existing markets*” **\(C8\)**. The e\-Laboratory is used across a range of sectors. Industrial gas company Air Liquide uses Ulster’s blast wave decay nomograms along with other tools to inform their safe design of hydrogen systems and infrastructure. The PPP and vehicle tank design and safety requirements have been important in influencing safety considerations in applications of electrolyzer manufacturer ITM Power, and the e\-Laboratory is being used to maximise the reach and impact of training at ENSOSP \( **C7**\). 

 **I4: Design of novel test protocols, patented breakthrough safety technologies** 

 HySAFER research demonstrated that the risk of hydrogen\-powered vehicles is acceptable on London roads if the onboard tank fire resistance is above 50 minutes or tank rupture in a fire is excluded. Ulster’s breakthrough safety technology of explosion free in a fire TPRD\-less tank fully excludes tank rupture in a fire and thus eliminates its devastating consequences. The work has been funded through a series of grants from 2017 onwards with examples given in Section 3 \(e.g. **G3, G5**\). This technology allows the use of hydrogen vehicles in tunnels and underground parking at risk below of that for fossil fuel vehicles. This IP solution is licenced, most recently by US based Optimum Composite Technologies LLC. Optimum specialises in the design, fabrication and production of alternative fuel cylinders and is focused on the development of compressed gas tanks for aftermarket automotive and OEM applications \( **C9**\). 

 **I5: European funding priorities** 

 The European hydrogen industry \(Hydrogen Europe\) formulates requirements for industry\-driven safety research through the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking \(FCH JU\) calls. The European Hydrogen Safety Panel \(EHSP\), including Molkov, advises FCH JU and the International Association for Hydrogen Safety \(IA HySafe\), including Ulster as a founding member and Molkov as Chair of Education Committee, and publishes Reference Reports on Research Priorities that influence the EC’s funding priorities. The importance of Ulster’s research in informing funding priorities is corroborated by the Chair of EHSP and IA HySafe Executive Committee member \( **C10**\), who states *“research at HySAFER, particularly on use of hydrogen indoors, CFD protocols and best practices, safety of liquefied hydrogen, and safety of hydrogen in confined spaces have been reflected in our research priority discussions and reports and have been used to inform the FCH JU Multi\-Annual Implementation Plan 2016\-2019 and related funding calls”.* 

 Overall, the work at HySAFER has contributed directly to the inherently safer engineering of hydrogen and fuel cell systems and infrastructure through tools, innovations, and RCS.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Technical capabilities developed for astrophysics and cosmology research at Oxford supported the growth of a start\-up company, Goonhilly Earth Station, from its birth to becoming a major player in the global satellite communications industry. This long\-term collaboration has supported job creation and secured UK participation in international commercial space projects and supported companies such as SES, Planet Labs and SpaceX. This same radio\-astronomy expertise that rejuvenated an aging satellite\-communications site in the UK was then put to use overseas in Africa and Mexico to create new jobs and foster a high\-technology science industry through training and technology transfer. The same team also collaborated with local industry in the UK, enabling a company \(Oxford Cryosystems\) to enter a new market that secured large long\-term contracts for their products \(including a GBP500,000 contract for the MeerKAT radio telescope\).

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This case is based on the research programme in Experimental Radio Cosmology in Oxford Physics. The research is based on concepts of designing and building novel instruments and telescopes to answer fundamental questions in cosmology and astrophysics that cannot be addressed with existing common\-user facilities. Many of the underlying science goals are based in cosmology – the Cosmic Microwave Background \(CMB\), and the history of structure formation in the universe. 

 The main research activity has been the observation of the CMB at centimetre wavelengths: the measurement of its angular\-power spectrum in intensity and polarization, the detection of secondary anisotropies such as the Sunyaev\-Zel’dovich effect **\[1,2\]**, and more recently the characterisation of the Galactic foreground emission that hinders the precise measurement of CMB polarization **\[3\]**. The ultimate goal of these measurements is to understand the physics of inflation by detecting the signature of the primordial gravitational\-wave background, which is imprinted in the polarization of the CMB. 

 The development of the universe on large scales is also traced by the evolution of active galaxies, which contain supermassive black holes at their centres. These often evolve into powerful sources of radio emission, allowing them to be detected across the entire observable universe. Radio telescopes such as e\-MERLIN **\[4\]** and \(in the future\) the Square Kilometre Array \(SKA\), which combine high sensitivity with high angular resolution, are used to image the cores of these galaxies, and are able to distinguish, for example, between radio radiation generated directly because of the black hole and emission from the bursts of star formation that are also associated with active galaxies. 

 Our research programme required the development of techniques in very high\-sensitivity radio measurements, across the whole range of techniques in radio astronomy – design of antennas, cryogenic receivers, broadband signal\-processing systems both analogue and digital, and processing and analysis of the output data. The development of these techniques is itself also a significant area of research; Oxford has made state\-of\-the\-art developments in all these fields. For example, **\[5\]** describes the C\-Band All\-Sky Survey \(C\-BASS\), a project led by Oxford, in which two ex\-telecommunications antennas were modified to improve their performance, fitted with cryogenic receivers, and used to survey the sky at 5GHz to identify foreground emission contaminating the CMB. The instrument concept as well as all the key technical features of the instrument were designed and built in Oxford, which also manages the data\-analysis and science exploitation effort. 

 Due to this record in developing innovative experiments such as C\-BASS, Oxford Physics was selected by the Square Kilometre Array Organization \(SKAO\) to develop the main multi\-frequency cryogenic receiver package \(‘Band 3\-4\-5’\) for the SKA, the world’s largest radio telescope. The design required a high degree of innovation in cryogenic and Radio Frequency \(RF\) design to meet the requirements of sensitivity, power consumption and cost over the very large frequency range of 1.6 – 15.3GHz **\[6\]**.  Amongst many other science goals, this receiver will provide the SKA with one of its key science capabilities, the ability to resolve the pebble\-scale accretion in protoplanetary disks, complementing the ability of ALMA to image dust disks. SKA development has been funded by the UK Government with two explicit goals: to provide astronomers with the tools to make future discoveries, but also to provide UK industry with the opportunity both to construct components for the SKA and to benefit from the new technologies involved.

###  Supporting the formation and success of Goonhilly Earth Station 

 In 2008, Oxford Physics began working with an entrepreneur planning to acquire the Goonhilly Earth Station \(GES\) site. This site, owned by BT, was the largest commercial telecoms satellite ground station in the world and had been in operation since 1962. Due to the obsolescence of large dishes for global satellite communications and their replacement by sub\-sea optical cables, it was scheduled to be demolished until Oxford Physics intervened. The team at Oxford Physics realised that the antennas at Goonhilly had significant potential for radio\-astronomy research, for example, by adding them to the UK’s national radio\-astronomy facility, e\-MERLIN, which would double its resolution for deep multi\-wavelength studies of galaxy evolution. In addition, if fitted with C\-BASS\-style receivers, they could be used as single\-dish radio telescopes to complement Oxford’s CMB research. The entrepreneur became the GES CEO and planned a business model including the synergy between radio astronomy and commercial satellite\-communications technologies, benefitting from access to Oxford’s cutting\-edge radio\-astronomy technology. For example, cooled receivers, which provide much improved noise performance, are rarely used in communications due to their perceived complexity. Oxford Physics has extensive experience with their design, development and deployment and so would be able to build receivers for GES antennas that could be used for both commercial communications and research **\[5, 6\]**. Rawlings lobbied BT in 2008 to preserve the antennas from demolition and engage in efforts to re\-purpose the site **\[A\],** and plans for antennas based on Oxford’s research \(specifically the C\-BASS receiver and digital backend **\[5\]**\) were crucial to the viability of the business model funded in GES’s series B investment **\[B\]**. Goonhilly Earth Station \(GES\) CEO said: “ *The intervention from Professor Rawlings helped persuade BT to stop the demolition”* and *“the strong support from Oxford University in backing the concepts in our business plan assisted in us gaining our first successful venture finance series A funding of £3.8m \[GBP3,800,000\] in January 2014*.” **\[B\].** GES fully acquired the site from BT in 2014 and has grown from 6 employees \(headcount: 6; FTEs: 6\) in 2014 to 49 \(headcount: 49; FTEs 49\) in 2020. GES CEO continued: “ *A key part of our business plan is to develop a private global Deep Space Network. To allow us to be competitive, we have worked closely with Professor Jones and Professor Taylor in developing concepts for maintaining the required antenna performance with a lower\-cost, smaller aperture solution. Input from the university was critical in helping us to develop a business plan to attract our series B investment. In 2018, following the award of an £8.4m \[GBP8,400,000\] ESA contract to upgrade our largest 32m antenna for use in deep space communication, we successfully completed our series B investment with UK billionaire, Peter Hargreaves. The investment was worth £24m \[GBP24,000,000\]. Our close collaboration with Oxford University was an important factor in securing the deal.*” **\[B\]**. GES now provides spacecraft tracking services to many of the world’s largest satellite operators, GES CEO said: “ *We are now a major player in the global ground station business, supporting the operations of companies such as SES, Planet Labs and SpaceX, including the recent first privately\-operated crewed flight to the International Space Station”. “We provide services to all the world’s leading space operators, we are building the world’s first private global deep space network and we have a diverse and broadening portfolio in space systems consultancy, space AI and machine learning, high performance computing, space situational awareness, training, education and outreach. None of this transformation would have been possible without the outstanding and bold collaboration with Oxford University”.* 

 The Consortium of Universities for Goonhilly Astronomy \(CUGA\) \(Oxford, Manchester, Leeds, Herts, Durham and Central Lancashire\) coordinates research with GES. While other universities made cash contributions, Oxford Physics supplied a cryogenic receiver based on the C\-BASS project, allowing both radio astronomy and communications use. This was commissioned in 2019 and is now used by GES for UK Government contracts in space situational awareness **\[B\]**.   In July 2020, GES was awarded GBP1,700,000, via the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership \(LEP\), from the UK Government Getting Building Fund as part of a GBP3,770,000 project to invest in a production facility for cryogenic receivers for radio astronomy and communications \(the ‘Receiver Factory’\) **\[C\]**, directly based on research carried out in Oxford Physics for C\-BASS and SKA **\[B\]**. 

###  Enabling local industry 

 During the research and development stage of the cryogenic receiver for the C\-BASS Southern Sky survey **\[3,5\]** it became clear that a new, low\-power, low maintenance coldhead would need to be integrated into the system in order to allow long\-term operations at the remote desert site where observations were to take place. Existing solutions were not viable, but a market survey uncovered a potential solution from Oxford Cryosystems \(OCS\) which was being used in the field of X\-ray crystallography. Oxford Physics approached OCS, who were previously unaware of the applications of their equipment in radio astronomy, and from 2015 collaborated with OCS to successfully integrate OCS equipment into a research receiver \(for C\-BASS\), and recognize the potential application of OCS products to MeerKAT, a South African radio telescope with which Oxford Physics had long\-standing research links **\[3,6\].** This resulted in OCS winning a GBP500,000 contract to supply coldheads to MeerKAT, completed in 2018, with a further GBP100,000 contract in 2020. OCS Managing Director commented: *“During this work we retained close links with Prof Jones and his team, who provided invaluable insight into the requirements of a radio telescope receiver, technical information on temperatures and heat loads but also practical insight into radio frequency interference, operating conditions, power budgets and so forth”* **\[D\]**. OCS coldheads were then selected as the baseline for SKA in 2014. Based on this successful collaboration, in 2014 STFC funded Oxford Physics and OCS to develop a helium compressor for the SKA, combining their respective skills in radio instrumentation and cryogenics. OCS Managing Director commented said: “ *This collaborative effort over a period of over 10 years made it possible for the SKA cryogenics contract worth approximately €8 million \[EUR8,000,000\] to be awarded to the UK. We are in pole position to supply both coldheads and compressors to the SKA project.”* “ *Thanks to the research and collaboration with Profs Jones and Taylor and their team over this 10\-year period, Oxford Cryosystems has become a strong player in a completely new market… The relationship is…a shining example of how collaboration between academia and industry can be of great benefit to both parties, delivering substantial impact for the UK economy*” **\[D\]**. Since 2014, Oxford Physics has been developing the Band 3\-4\-5 receiver package for SKA **\[6\]**. Against strong competition from other countries, the UK has been conditionally allocated the construction contracts for this and the SKA cryogenics. The Head of the SKA Project at STFC said: “ *STFC’s support has enabled the University of Oxford to lead the UK’s interests in SKA MID Frequency Band 5 and MID Frequency Cryogenic Systems. This work is unique to the University of Oxford and no other UK university has played a role in these areas. This work has required the University of Oxford to work closely with UK Industry, the SKA Organisation \(SKAO\) and international partners, establishing strong collaborations from which UK research may benefit in the future. As a result of the research conducted at the University of Oxford, the UK has been conditionally allocated construction work to deliver both the SKA MID Band 5 Receivers and MID Cryogenic Systems for the MID Frequency Antennas. These contracts are estimated to be worth €11.6M \[EUR11,600,000\] and €8.5M \[EUR8,500,000\] respectively and are expected to be delivered by UK Industry. This represents approximately 17% of the construction work currently allocated to the UK and brings economic and societal return on the UK’s investment in the SKA*” **\[E\]**. 

###  Societal impact from fostering new technology and skills development overseas 

 Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy \(DARA\) is a Newton Fund project \(2015\) with Oxford, other UK universities and GES which uses radio astronomy as a vehicle for human capital development \(HCD\), developing high\-tech and business skills in the eight African countries that will host SKA antennas: Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. Oxford Physics taught a programme on radio telescope design and observations at an annual four\-week residential course based at the Hartebeestoek Observatory, South Africa. The course included lectures and practical workshops where the students learned the underpinning physics and techniques required to build and use radio astronomy receivers as well as data analysis techniques. The modules all drew upon Oxford’s recent research background and experience, in particular on the development of the SKA and CBASS receivers and the data analysis and science exploitation of the CBASS data **\[5, 6\]**. The DARA partner organisations have trained 140 students to date in radio astronomy, sharing technical and commercial expertise that inspires the students to boost economic growth by setting up their own businesses and passing on their knowledge and skills to the next generation. The Chair & Director of the Centre for Radio Astronomy Techniques & Technologies, Rhodes University, South Africa explained: “ *A key aim of DARA is to impart generic skills that have application beyond Radio Astronomy, and that are particularly relevant to the developing economies in Africa. Examples include data analytics, telecommunications systems, and digital and radio frequency electronics. This use of Astronomy as a platform for driving training and research in modern technologies is consistent with the strategy of the South African Department of Science and Innovation. Such initiatives are seen as essential to enable social development and economic sustainability in the context of Africa....Past students have returned to their home countries and have used the skills that they acquired to good effect at academic institutions and within industry*” **\[F\]**. One participant from Zambia who took part in the DARA training programme has graduated as an Environmental Engineer. As well as working in this capacity for large companies he has started a small consulting firm with some of his university classmates. The DARA experience inspired him to try and expand the services that his small business can offer by utilising remote sensing data from satellites. *""It is because of the knowledge that I acquired through the DARA training program that barely a few months after I completed the training I got a job. The DARA program introduced me to Agri Big Data which can help in decision making in agriculture and increase Zambia's agricultural productivity. Agri Big Data is an exciting program one which I believe holds the answer to agricultural success for the developing countries of the world especially in Africa""* **\[G\]**. The impact of the project was recognised by the Society of Satellite Professionals International \(SSPI\) with “The Better Satellite World Awards,” in 2018, recognising the space\-related project most likely to improve the world. 

 In a further Newton Fund HCD project with the Instituto de Radioastronomía y Astrofísica \(UNAM\) and the Mexican state of Hidalgo, Oxford Physics has provided the design of the receiver equipment \(based on the C\-BASS project\) as part of a project to upgrade a satellite\- ground\-station antenna for modern radio astronomy. The converted antenna is a centrepiece of Hidalgo’s strategy to shift their economy from mining to science\-based industry **\[H\]** and the Tulancingo Radio Observatory is one of three laboratories forming the core of a strategic plan to position Hidalgo as a national leader in space\-related science, technology and innovation **\[I\]**. The company Centro de Ingeniería y Desarrollo Industrial \(CIDESI\) benefitted from the collaboration with Oxford Physics, as the Head of Laboratory for Radio Astronomy Instrumentation at UNAM explained: *“Perhaps most significant was the development of human resources, as the engineering staff of CIDESI became acquainted with the special and demanding needs of the radio astronomy community for precise and reliable drive systems and antenna controls. Although CIDESI was already quite skilled in this area, their experience with the Oxford group served to develop their contacts with the academic/scientific community, beyond the manufacturing community that they generally serve. Their new\-found expertise has permitted them to contract for services at state universities within Mexico which operate small radio telescopes, not only providing an essential support service to the universities but also generating multiple contracts for CIDESI at the level of \[GBP10,000 to GBP20,000\]”*. The primary contractor involved in the antenna conversion has also benefitted from the new experience gained on steerable antennas and is now able to seek similar contracts across Latin America. The Head of Laboratory for Radio Astronomy Instrumentation at UNAM commented: “ *The transfer of these skills, developed in the research environment of Oxford, has had an extensive and diverse impact within Mexico… The State of Hidalgo and various subcontractors within Mexico have also directly benefitted from the Oxford radio group's involvement in Mexico…* *The radio observatory forms the foundation of the Hidalgo effort to attract high\-tech industries to the state and to become the national leader in space technologies”* **\[I\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Federica Mazzara’s research revolves around the ways in which contemporary art and cultural practices can subvert and resist mainstream discourse around migration in Europe. Through *Sink Without Trace*, a major art exhibition curated by Mazzara with artist Maya Ramsay across June and July 2019, the following impacts were achieved. 

-  The enhancement of public understanding via both the exhibition, which demonstrably affected visitor perspectives on migration, and its associated media coverage, by which discussion of the subject matter via the art enabled redress of the dehumanising narrative of the “migrant crisis”. Further, a companion installation achieved similar changes in public understanding through artistic communication outside of the gallery context. 

-  Impact on the stakeholders involved in *Sink Without Trace* through the heightening of visibility for its charity partner, Alarm Phone, and changes in the practice, profile, and opportunities for the artists that featured in the exhibition.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Undertaking research on Lampedusa, an Italian island that marks a landing point for migrants entering Europe by sea, Dr Mazzara’s work incorporates an interdisciplinary approach to migration and its representation that aims to redress the narrative that Europe is the victim of an unmanageable crisis. Resisting the mainstream representation of migrants as nameless and faceless masses with neither rights nor voice, Mazzara’s emphasis on the rights of migrants and refugees to move/escape has contributed to various discourses concerning the politics of migration \(e.g. Papadopolus et. al,  [2008](https://www.plutobooks.com/9781783716135/escape-routes/); Mezzadra,  [2010](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/gaze-autonomy-capitalism-migration-social-struggles-sandro-mezzadra-translated-rodrigo-nunes/e/10.4324/9780203839829-15); De Genova,  [2017](https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-borders-of-europe), etc.\), and to an understanding of migrants as individuals with agency and self\-determination. 

 By contrast to other scholars in the field, Mazzara’s research is distinguished by its focus on the ways in which art and cultural expressions have the ability to make visible to the viewer aspects and facets of migration that are commonly overlooked in the media and governmental discourse. Art, it is argued, is able to build a new discourse around migrants and refugees that goes beyond the essentialist approach that labels them as victims and/or criminals. For example, in a 2015 journal article Mazzara provides detailed analysis of the documentary *Soltanto il mare* \[Nothing but the Sea\] \(2010\) by Italo\-Ethiopian filmmaker Dagmawi Yimer, exploring the tensions within the visual discourse surrounding forms of migration that are deemed “illegal” \[1\]. 

 Developing this approach, Mazzara has gone on to analyse grassroots documentary and visual art projects that express what she calls an “aesthetics of subversion”, by which those normally depicted as “imperceptible bodies” become “subjects of power” that are able to subvert the narrative around their journey, their past, and their desires for the future \[2\]. The individualising of these persons undermines the fabrication and spectacle of “crisis” that is commonly associated with the arrival of irregularised migrants to the island of Lampedusa and which fuels a “moral panic” to which they are subjected. 

 Elsewhere, Mazzara has examined how the wreckage of refugees’ boats on the island of Lampedusa have come to serve as material testimonies to an ongoing and perilous global transit. This includes writings on the work of local activist collective Askavusa, who have a space called Porto M where objects are displayed to the public in order to preserve something tangible from the often traumatic memory of the passage. Mazzara argues that such work not only questions what constitutes aesthetic representation but also exposes the inadequacies of European and International policies that continue to render illegal the right of refugees and asylum seekers to move and survive \[3\]. 

 This interdisciplinary approach to the subject culminated in her 2019 monograph, *Reframing Migration: Lampedusa, Border Spectacle and Aesthetics of Subversion* \[4\]. Building upon her previous work, this book reframes migration in the Mediterranean, and specifically around the island of Lampedusa, by exploring how a broad range of activism and art forms have become a platform for subverting the dominant narrative of migration. Mazzara identifies how such subversion generates a vital form of political dissent that reveals the contradictions and paradoxes of the securitarian regime that regulates immigration into Europe. 

 The above research also led to Mazzara conceiving of an exhibition that would function as a crucial component of this broader interdisciplinary project on migration, representation, and aesthetics. *Sink Without Trace* was hosted by the P21 Gallery in King’s Cross in London, across June and July 2019, and was co\-curated by Mazzara and artist  [<ins>Maya Ramsay</ins>](http://www.mayaramsay.co.uk/). This is one of the first exhibitions to deal specifically with the subject of migrant deaths at sea, with the majority of the works never before exhibited in the UK \[5\]. The scope of the exhibition was such that the variety of works communicated, explored, and provoked discussion of various aspects of the dangerous journey of migration by sea, through artworks that incorporated found objects \(ship wreckage, abandoned items of domesticity\), naval data, real and fictional film footage of such journeys, and artistic interpretations of testimony from the migrants who have undertaken them.

#  Enhancing Public Understanding of the Phenomenon of Migration 

##  The Sink Without Trace Exhibition 

 *Sink Without Trace* was hosted by the P21 Gallery in King’s Cross in London, from June 12 \- July 13, 2019. The exhibition presented artworks by 17 artists from 11 countries on the subject of migrant deaths at sea, with a focus on works by artists from refugee and migrant backgrounds. 7 of these artists had personal experience of fleeing to Europe by sea. Several of the works were specially commissioned for the exhibition and it was the first time that many of the works were exhibited in the UK. To date, the exhibition has provided the most in\-depth overview of art being made on the subject of migrant deaths at sea and reflects the fact that the majority of migrants that attempt to travel by sea drown and their bodies are never found or counted. 

 A key aim of the exhibition was to enhance public understanding of the phenomenon of migration by exposing the viewers to facts, data, and stories that are commonly concealed in the public discourse of the mainstream media, in line with the aesthetics of subversion described earlier. This was partly achieved through the extensive media coverage Mazzara and Ramsay obtained, which **successfully functioned to redress the dehumanising narrative of the “migrant crisis” for a diverse audience of media consumers.** The following media articles are collated in document \[a\] along with several others. 

 <ins> *The Financial Times*</ins> described the exhibition as having the “distinction \[…\] that seven of its artists have been refugees” and describes the “heart\-wrenching” circumstance of one of these artists in connection to his artwork. This demonstrates how the exhibition enabled mainstream platforms to provide individualised, and humanising, insights into the discourse around migrant journeys. Notably, though the headline of the article referred to an art market featuring Victoria Beckham in order to draw in more readers, Mazzara’s exhibition was given 4 paragraphs as the lead subject of the piece, double the length of each of the three other exhibitions featured. 

 As with *The Financial Times*,  [<ins> *The Art Newspaper*</ins>](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/dear-christoph-buechel-this-is-how-you-provide-context) positively emphasised the contextualising of the art pieces in the exhibition, by which “the stories of migrant deaths at sea” are told, via a contrast with a controversial 2019 Venice Biennale piece by Christoph Büchel, who had chosen to show a boat on which 458 migrants died “as a work of art devoid of all context”. The latter article also goes into depth in its description of the artists’ work such that it provides insight into specific stories of migrant deaths at sea, emphasising the human element of such tragedies, where wider media had been focusing on border issues. 

 [<ins> *The Institute of Race Relations*</ins>](http://www.irr.org.uk/news/sink-without-trace-migrant-deaths-in-the-mediterranean/) similarly draws the contrast with Büchel’s piece and points out that “\[t\]here must be alternative ways of seeing that resist the logic of dehumanisation and also avoid diminishing the enormity of the ongoing calamity. Some of these can be found in *Sink Without Trace*”. The article uses the various artworks of the exhibition to describe the stories of these specific migrant deaths at sea in order to contextualise, and show the human cost of, the UK and EU policy decisions and discourse on migration across recent years. 

 The  [<ins> *Observer*</ins>](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/08/migrant-deaths-at-sea-exhibiton-sink-without-trace) \(whose content appears on *The Guardian* website – the UK’s ‘most widely\-read digital newspaper title with over 5.2 million weekly readers in 2019’\) dedicated an extended feature article to the exhibition which was shared 1,247 times online. The corrective nature of *Sink Without Trace* on the mainstream narrative around the “migrant crisis” is perhaps best summarised by the following passage on artist Max Hirzel’s exhibited photo series on “the deadliest modern shipwreck in the Mediterranean”. Indicating the way in which art reconfigures how the viewer conceives of the “value” of the migrant experience, the journalist writes that Italian PM “Renzi’s decision to recover the boat was controversial, with critics questioning the €9.5m spent. Hirzel wanted to show the value of these efforts: the series felt like a duty, he says, to victims and their families”. 

 The above coverage also successfully brought people to the exhibition, as the following feedback comment demonstrates: “I read about it in the Guardian. I am glad I came to see it for myself. I was a bit afraid of feeling like a voyeur. But that has not been my experience. The exhibition is so varied, so raw and shocking in its scope. Everyone should come to see this, especially secondary\-age school children” \[b\]. 

 The above comment is just one amongst many others that highlight how **visitors changed their views on migration as a direct response to viewing the exhibition.** Around 800 people attended the exhibition and the related events \(talks, performances, and workshops\) between 12 June and 13 July. A questionnaire consisting of three questions was completed by 291 visitors after the visit and is collated in document \[b\]. 

 Asked the extent to which their views or understanding of migrant deaths at sea had changed upon visiting *Sink Without Trace*, 31% answered “Greatly”, and 43% “Somewhat”; asked whether they are **now more likely to engage with campaigns to improve migration policies in the UK and Europe** due to their visit, 42% answered “Greatly”, and 37% “Somewhat”; while 38% for each of these categories stated that they are now more likely to give to charities involved in rescue at sea. 

 This is significant given that it **affected the attitudes of persons who were already engaged in the subject matter** \(hence the figures for the “Somewhat” category\). For instance, one attendee wrote in the space provided for comments: “The way it’s curated had an impact on my conscience even though I’m aware of the issues”, while another said: “I already felt sympathetic to the issue but it gave me info to talk about it with others”. Others emphasised how the artistic dimensions allowed them to see the issue in a new light: “We entered the exhibit full of outrage at EU policy. But these extraordinary series of artworks remembered the policy all the more horrifying in its human dimensions”; “it made me think about the people and the places. \[M\]uch more cerebral and emotional than political”; “The exhibition prompted a lot of reflection that will take some time to process \[…\] the show is not didactic… rather, it prompts thought”. 

 Importantly, the comments also speak to the exhibition’s power to change public consciousness on the issue of migrant deaths at sea: “I think this exhibition can really open the eyes of people that don’t know about it”; “This exhibition is powerful because it pushes the visitor to think about migrants as single persons, as human beings, in a time where medias try to dehumanize them”. 

##  The TO6411 Installation 

 Along with the artworks at P21 gallery, *Sink Without Trace* presented an installation at the nearby Regent’s Canal for 7 days during  [Refugee Week](https://refugeeweek.org.uk/events/to6411-migrant-boat-displayed-regents-canal-part-sink-without-trace-exhibition/) \(17\- 23 June 2019\). This installation consisted of artist Lucy Wood's migrant boat, *TO6411*; a small fishing boat from Libya, aboard which thirty\-six North Africans successfully reached Lampedusa in 2012. Wood’s artistic project involved the solo sailing of this boat from Lampedusa to London, stopping off at various Mediterranean ports along the way. Over 400 people visited the moored boat, which enabled **public exposure to artistic communication of the subject matter outside of the gallery context**. In this way the work reached audiences beyond those especially interested in the arts or this subject matter. 

 Feedback was collected from 53 visitors during those 7 days, through a questionnaire consisting of three questions and a space for comments as with the main exhibition. The responses are collated as document \[c\]. 

 Asked the extent to which **the visitor’s views and understanding of the risks involved in migration by sea had changed** after seeing boat T06411, 47% answered “Greatly” and 34% “Somewhat”; asked whether seeing T06411 changed their impression of the conditions in which migrants travel by sea, 57% answered “Greatly”; and asked the extent to which they were **now more likely to give to charities involved in rescue at sea or to campaign for changes in migration policy**, 55% answered “Greatly” and 30% “Somewhat”. 

 The comments collected spoke to the affective nature of the boat installation and the way it **redressed mainstream media narratives of migration**. For instance: “The starkness of seeing the vessel, its size when thinking of the number of occupants and the remaining and belongings really shows clearly the difficulties they faced and the extent they were willing to suffer for a chance of bettering their lives”; “Syrian refugees, media, awareness raising through social media affected me, but TO6411 got my attention deeply emotionally”; “I feel I have learned a lot. I have been shocked over the years by migrant stories in the media but have not really engaged with the reality before. Visual art can be so powerful and connects with you in a different way”; “Seeing it on news de\-humanises it but seeing actual objects hits you with a force. It makes you sad and empathetic”. 

#  Impact on the stakeholders involved in Sink Without Trace 

##  Alarm Phone 

 The exhibition also supported  [<ins>Alarm Phone</ins>](https://alarmphone.org/en/about/), a self\-organised hotline for refugees in distress in the Mediterranean Sea. Over the past five years, the charity has assisted tens of thousands of migrants by reaching over 2,800 boats in distress. **This charity partner benefitted from this popular exhibition through increased visibility and financial contribution**. 

 A donation link to Alarm Phone was included on the exhibition’s website, and they received the proceeds from 70% of the sales from exhibition catalogues and 50% of sales from tickets for the artists’ workshops, with the remainder supporting the gallery that hosted the exhibition. The founders of Alarm Phone valued the visibility created by *Sink Without Trace* as much as the £1000 direct donation to their work raised during the exhibition: “We are very grateful that the curators have chosen the WatchTheMed Alarm Phone as the recipients of the proceeds \[…\] as they will help us sustain this activist project that is solely funded through private donations. We require donations to maintain our hotline, to pursue information campaigns to make sea crossings safer, to conduct research along the different flight routes, and to organise biannual meetings in which about 100 people participate, coming together from at least 12 countries. We want to thank the curators of Sink Without Trace for raising the visibility around the issue of migrant deaths at sea, and for directly supporting our project that tries to make deaths at sea history” \[d\]. 

 In respect to increased visibility for the charity itself, it is notable that the aforementioned *Financial Times* article highlighted that the exhibition was “well\-pitched” due to the curators being “conscious of the ethics around selling work from their show \[…\] with proceeds going to the charity Alarm Phone, a hotline for refugees in distress in the Mediterranean Sea that connects them to rescue services”, thus bringing exposure to the charity on a page directed towards wealthy collectors \(the page is tagged “Collecting” within “The Art Market” category of their content\) \[a\]. Other media articles on the exhibition \(for instance, by *The Observer* and *Institute of Race Relations*\), also included direct links to the Alarm Phone site where their readers could make donations. 

##  The Artists 

 Follow up contact with five of the artists involved in *Sink Without Trace* a year after the exhibition – Maya Ramsay, Shorsh Saleh, Victoria Burgher, Max Hirzel, and Tamara Kametani – has elucidated the following impacts the exhibition had on their work and careers \[e\]. 

 Several of the artists spoke of how engagement with the exhibition had resulted in **a change in their artistic practice**. For instance, Burgher states engagement with Mazzara and Ramsay had been key to determining her work for the exhibition: “Discussions with the curators enabled me to develop an idea and consider its conceptual and material manifestation. This interest and feedback from curators leading to new and developed work is so crucial to artists”. Similarly, Hirzel writes: “in order to make my work fit to be used in the context of an exhibition, I had to do lots of editing on both visual and textual aspects of my work. This has generated something different and potentially more powerful, especially thanks to the contribution of the curators, whose input has been priceless”. Demonstrating long term change to his artistic practice, Saleh states that the audience “responses were very useful as they made it clear to me that the public are most interested in my miniature paintings rather than my mixed media works so I decided to continue to work with that format”. 

 The artists also confirm that participation in the exhibition has **enhanced their profiles by providing greater media visibility**. Hirzel points out that his participation opened up opportunities previously closed to him: “SWT gave great visibility to my work, thanks especially to the international media attention \[…\] which I had tried unsuccessfully to attract in the past”. Hirzel highlights the aforementioned Observer article, as well as the publication of a dozen photos from his series on a dedicated webpage on  [<ins> *The Guardian*</ins>](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/jun/08/documenting-migrant-deaths-in-the-mediterranean-max-hirzel-sink-without-trace-in-pictures) that was shared 339 times \[a\]. Ramsay and Saleh highlight their involvement in “numerous newspaper articles and TV interviews”, along with interviews with migration focused outlets such as Migration Collective for the Maritime Museum and the journal Justice for All, as a direct result of their participation in the exhibition \[e\]. 

 Further, it has **enhanced these artists’ careers by enabling them to expand their professional networks**. This is attested to by both Ramsay \(who “made many new contacts in the field”\) and Kametani: “By taking part in the exhibition, I was able to present my work to a new audience, work with new artists, and grow my professional network”.
