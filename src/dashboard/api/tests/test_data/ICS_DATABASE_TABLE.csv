 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 In 2016, following a series of major incidents at the national penal detention facility for young people in Ireland \(Oberstown Detention Campus\), the Oberstown Board of Management, acting on behalf of the Government Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, commissioned an ‘Operational Review’. Goldson’s extensive research in the youth justice and penal detention fields resulted in his appointment to co\-lead the Review and the Minister described its recommendations – directly informed by insights and findings from the underpinning research \- as being ‘at the kernel of how we move forward’ and as shaping ‘a significant package of reform’. Following the adoption and implementation of the recommendations, both internal and ‘arms\-length’ monitoring mechanisms have provided a wide\-range of evidence verifying improvements in policy and practice over the period 2017\-2020. The sustained high\-profile national attention that the Review attracted and continues to attract \(from politicians, print and broadcast media and civil society organisations\) has also served to hold public bodies to account. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research comprises a coherent programme of work led by Goldson over two decades, focusing principally on the functioning and effects of criminal/youth justice systems \(especially penal detention\), benchmarked against the provisions of international law/human rights standards. 

 In the early 2000s, two of Goldson’s overlapping national studies \- the ‘National Remand Review’ \(2000\-03\) and ‘Vulnerability and Custody’ \(2000\-04\) \(both funded by The Children’s Society\) \- detailed the myriad vulnerabilities of young prisoners including their exposure to processes that often violate international human rights law/standards \( **3.1**\). Practices including ‘restraint’ and single separation \(solitary confinement\) were found to be particularly problematic for all young prisoners and, at the extremes, were shown to be fatal. Building upon this work, ‘Youth Deaths in Prison Custody’ \(funded by INQUEST, 2003\-05\) was the first detailed study to explicitly centre youth deaths in penal detention. The research revealed the vital importance of independent transparent review and accountability mechanisms in order to draw lessons from critical incidents in youth penal detention and to apply such lessons in ways that improve policy and practice \( **3.2**\). 

 Young people with complex needs and mental health conditions are especially vulnerable and key insights and findings provided by the ‘Youth Justice and Mental Health Diversion’ study \(funded by the NIHR, Department of Health, 2011\-13\), indicated that to obtain best outcomes for such young people clear, consistent and human rights\-compliant policies and practices \- that address their specific needs \- and the systematic provision of appropriate staff training, regular supervision and accountability structures are imperative \( **3.3**\). 

 The principal insights and findings provided by the ‘Knowledge, Effectiveness and Human Rights in the Youth Justice Sphere’ research \(funded by the Leverhulme Trust, 2012\-13\), relate both to the potential for international human rights law/standards to positively shape best policy and practice in youth justice and penal detention but also to barriers and forms of resistance that can impede the implementation of such standards \( **3.4**\). Similarly, by engaging trans\-national longitudinal research the ‘Comparative Youth Penality Project’ \(funded by the Australian Research Council, 2013\-15\), further examined both the prospects and the limitations of international law/standards to drive best practice in youth justice and penal detention \( **3.5** and **3.6**\). 

 Goldson’s track\-record of directing the extended programme of research, together with the salience of the insights and findings provided by the same research, led \(in September 2016\) to his appointment to co\-lead the ‘Operational Review’ of Oberstown \(with Professor Nick Hardwick, previously HM Chief Inspector of Prisons and Chair of the Parole Board in England and Wales\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 In September 2016, following a protracted series of major incidents at Oberstown \(culminating in inmate protests and a fire that caused widespread damage estimated to cost €3.5 million – **5.1\(i\)**\), the Oberstown Board of Management, acting on behalf of the Government Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, commissioned an ‘Operational Review’ and Goldson was appointed to co\-lead it \(with Hardwick\) \( **5.1\(ii\) and 5.1 \(iii\)**\). 

 The principal purpose of the Review was to provide research\-informed recommendations to improve policy and practice at Oberstown. The enduring impact on significantly and measurably improving human rights\-compliant policy and practice at Oberstown is yielding major demonstrable benefits for young people in detention in Ireland and for the staff who work with them. 

 The ongoing impact on holding public bodies to account and exposing them to high\-level scrutiny imposes a wider reach that is extending across a diverse range of publics including Parliamentarians and policy\-makers, the Children’s Ombudsman’s office in Ireland, children’s/human rights agencies, penal reform organisations and the general public. 

 Evidence of impact on improving policy and practice 

 In March 2017, Goldson \(and Hardwick\) submitted a detailed report of the Operational Review to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and to the Oberstown Board of Management. The report contained 95 recommendations that were distinctly and materially informed by insights and findings drawn from the underpinning research \(see section 2 above\). Both internal and ‘arms\-length’ monitoring mechanisms, together with numerous debates, statements and both oral and written questions/answers during sittings of the Dáil Éireann, Houses of the Oireachtas \(Ireland’s Parliament\) and the Joint Oireachtas \(Parliamentary\) Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, have subsequently provided a wide\-range of evidence verifying that the adoption and implementation of the recommendations has impacted positively on improving policy and practice at Oberstown over the period 2017\-2020. 

 Almost immediately after receiving the Report of the Operational Review \(and cognate reports obtained from other reviews\), the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs established a ‘Review Implementation Group’ \(RIG\). Chaired by the Chairperson of the Oberstown Board of Management and including representatives from the Government Department for Children and Youth Affairs and other key stakeholders, the RIG was tasked with ‘referring all recommendations with policy and/or resource implications to the Minister for consideration \[and\] to propose a timed, costed schedule with designated responsibilities for implementation of the recommendations’ \( **5.2: page 9, para 4.1**\). The RIG met on ten occasions \- between March and December 2017 \- before publishing a ‘Final Report’ on December 22, 2017 in which it set out ‘key themes and priorities’ for driving reforms \( **5.2: pages 11\-13**\). 

 Alongside the RIG \- that was required to report to the ‘Board and the Minister on a monthly basis on the implementation of the review’s recommendations’ \( **5.2: page 9, para 4.1**\) \- the Oberstown Board of Management also constituted a specific sub\-committee to explicitly monitor progress in respect of the 95 ‘Operational Review’ recommendations. In July 2017, the Board published a 23\-page report in which it forensically and systematically set out its responses to ‘each and every recommendation… \[detailing\] the measures that… have been taken or are due to be taken in the areas identified’ \( **5.3: page 3**\). 

 In a companion report also published in July 2017, the Oberstown Board of Management stated: ‘the recommendations \[of the ‘Operational Review’\] address matters of national youth justice law and policy… and identify the steps necessary to ensure that better care is provided to young people on Campus. Recommendations address the use of restrictive practices, such as… single separation and restraint, and highlight the need for inclusive, post\-incident reviews. The Review also addresses… the need to… strengthen management capacity and ensure that all staff are trained, supervised and held to account in the provision of high\-quality care… the implementation of these recommendations is well underway’ \( **5.4: pages 5\-6**\). 

 The ‘Oberstown Strategic Plan’ \(2017\-20\) was also published in 2017. The ‘strategic objectives’ for driving reform that are prioritised in the Plan mirror the ‘Operational Review’ recommendations that are explicitly informed by insights and findings drawn from the underpinning research including: the provision of best quality and human rights\-compliant care for young people in detention; the systematic implementation of staff training, development and supervision; the operationalisation of policies, procedures and standards consistent with international standards and; the application of robust governance and effective accountability mechanisms \( **5.5: **passim**\)**. 

 Additional evidence of positive and enduring impact on improving policy and practice is provided by arms\-length monitoring mechanisms. On October 17, 2018, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs wrote to Goldson and Hardwick stating: ‘HIQA \[Health Information and Quality Authority\] is authorized… under the Children Act 2001 to undertake inspections of Oberstown Children Detention Campus… \[it\] published the report of this inspection this week… Overall the inspection found that… improvements were evident… as you know the recommendations from your report, all of which are at the kernel of how we move forward… are being implemented as part of a significant package of reform in Oberstown’ \( **5.6**\). More specifically, the HIQA report published in 2018 notes: ‘progress was evident in relation to… children’s rights and care of children… improvements with respect to the planning and review of children’s care… \[and\] a reduction in the use of restrictive practices’ **\(5.7\(i\): pages 7\-8\)**. With specific regard to the use of ‘single separation’ \(solitary confinement\), for example, HIQA reported a 56% reduction ‘in the use of this type of intervention’ compared to the corresponding period in the previous year \( **5.7\(i\): page 24**\). 

 Further, the HIQA report of its inspection of Oberstown conducted in July 2019 \(and published in January 2020\) verifies that improvements in policy and practice are being sustained. It refers to ‘a cultural shift… \[that\] promoted a less restrictive living environment for young people… The director was held to account by the board and there was a system in place to monitor and track the implementation of all required actions at an operational level… It was evident that the stabilisation of the campus had allowed for an increased focus on the care of young people, which included how day to day care was planned and delivered’ \( **5.7\(ii\): pages 7\-9 **passim**\). 

 Finally, evidence provided by ‘arms\-length’ HIQA reports is consistent with the repeated written and oral statements/answers that the Minister has persistently issued to the Joint Oireachtas \(Parliamentary\) Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and to the Dáil Éireann, Houses of the Oireachtas \(Ireland’s Parliament\) to the effect that the recommendations of the ‘Operational Review’, informed by the insights and findings from the underpinning research are: ‘at the kernel of how we move forward to make Oberstown a safer place for young people and staff’ and that ‘the implementation of these recommendations has been my key priority to bring about improvements in standards. My Department is supporting and, where appropriate, monitoring the changes necessary to ensure that international standards and best practice are observed and to identify and address any barriers or challenges to maintaining our ethos of care’ \(December 18, 2018 \- **5.8i: page 5;** see also September 20, 2018 \- **5.8ii** and February 13, 2019 – **5.8iii**\). 

 Evidence of impact on holding public bodies to account 

 Notwithstanding the publication of the recommendations of the ‘Operational Review’ and extensive evidence of impact in improving policy and practice \(and directly benefiting young people and staff at Oberstown\), both the Government Minister and the Oberstown Board of Management have thus far refused to publish the full Report and to place it in the public domain. Paradoxically, however, such resistance has yielded significant positive impact by holding public bodies to account, exposing them to high\-level scrutiny and generating authoritative debate. 

 From 2017\-present, sustained demands for the publication of the full Report have included major investigative journalistic interventions predicated upon extensive data obtained via Freedom of Information legislation. For example, prime\-time national radio documentary coverage on RTE exposed high\-level resistance to public scrutiny \(November 11, 2018\) \( **5.9i**\). Such resistance has been met by repeated calls from numerous authoritative bodies for the full Report to be made available in the public interest including: the Ombudsman for Children appearing before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs \(January 16, 2018\) \( **5.9ii: page 10**\); the Taoiseach \[Prime Minister\] being pressed to order the publication of the full Report in the Dáil Éireann, Houses of the Oireachtas  \(November 14, 2018\) \( **5.9iii: page 932**\); extended oral questioning of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the Dáil Éireann \(December 13, 2018\) \( **5.9iv: pages 14\-17**\); public statements via agency web\-pages including the Irish Penal Reform Trust \(May 31, 2019\) \( **5.9v**\) and, most recently, further written questions tabled in the Dáil Éireann to the incoming Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration \(September 29, 2020\) \( **5.9vi**\). Further, Goldson and Hardwick made a lengthy appearance before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs \(January 30, 2019\) \( **5.10i: pages 1\-22**\) and subsequently received correspondence from the Chair of the Committee confirming that: ‘it is the Committee’s view that the report should be published’ \(July 24, 2019\) \( **5.10ii**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Joe Moran’s writing on shyness raised public awareness and understanding of this common but often ill\-defined condition. In the recent focus on mental health and wellbeing in public discourse and policy, shyness has received little attention. Moran’s project made shyness part of public discussions about wellbeing and being human, and addressed unhelpful simplifications of and misconceptions about it. This work formed part of Moran’s longstanding commitment to public writing and the communication of complex issues and debates beyond the academy. He has continued his interest in the relationship between creativity and mental health in more recent books, written for a wide readership, on writing \(First You Write a Sentence, 2018\) and failure \(If You Should Fail: A Book of Solace, 2020\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Moran conducted all the research and impact for this project whilst at LJMU. The main research output was a 95,000\-word monograph, Shrinking Violets: A Field Guide to Shyness, published in the UK in 2016 and in the US \(in extensively revised form\) in 2017. 

 Until Moran’s book, shyness had received little scholarly attention within the humanities. As a mundane and chronic condition, it has also largely evaded psychological definition and medicalisation, although extreme versions of it have been diagnosed recently in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as ‘social phobia’ or ‘social anxiety disorder’. The contiguous but distinct phenomenon of introversion aroused much public interest following the bestselling success of Susan Cain’s book Quiet \(2012\). Moran’s work, which Cain has called ‘thoughtful, beautifully written and vividly detailed’ \(quote provided for dustjacket copy for Shrinking Violets\), fed into the interest around these broad areas of social anxiety and introversion while offering quite different insights. 

 Moran argues that shyness cannot primarily be understood through scientific categorisation or medical diagnosis. Unlike related phenomena such as introversion, shame, embarrassment, fear and timidity, it is hard to explain in terms of differing levels of brain stimulation, observable physiological manifestations, or adaptive, self\-preservatory evolutionary traits. 

 It is best understood, instead, as a fundamentally human condition, bound up with the uniquely human activity of meaning\-making, and our capacity to construct strange, circular, self\-defeating stories about ourselves. The real feelings associated with shyness are thus inseparable from how we articulate those feelings. Moran shows that shyness has been felt and thought about in countless, historically specific ways. In tracing the cultural history and shifting representation of shyness, his book makes a significant contribution to recent work in the medical humanities and the history of emotions. 

 Shyness, Moran argues, is both common and complicated, existing on a continuum running from mild social awkwardness to crippling anxiety. Many outgoing people experience it, and even the acutely shy experience it unevenly and situationally. It manifests itself in such diverse ways because it feeds on two opposing human traits: self\-consciousness and sociability. Shyness, which rarely involves complete social withdrawal, reveals the human capacity to sublimate our communicative urges into oblique forms – art, music and writing, for instance – and tangential social behaviours. 

 Moran’s work seeks to challenge the simplistic narratives of self\-help and personal growth that surround shyness. Where the Victorians spoke of ‘constitutional shyness’, we now prefer to see shyness as a debility to be overcome, even a pathology to be treated. Moran sees it, rather, as an enduring and tenacious aspect of our personalities, part of being human. His work thus seeks to dispel misunderstandings about, and enrich our understanding of, this inescapably human condition. 

 Shrinking Violets achieves this not through the standard communication of research findings, but through an innovative work of scholarly non\-fiction, a hybrid of memoir, biography, cultural history, textual criticism and philosophical reflection. It conveys, in writing that is rich, layered, lyrical and particularising, the many\-sided and elusive nature of its subject. It aims to enable both the shy and non\-shy to understand shyness better, as both an intimately felt experience and a culturally articulated one, and to see it as part of the healthy jigsaw of human diversity.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Moran’s book, Shrinking Violets, received widespread attention, nationally and internationally. It was BBC Radio 4 Book of the Week in August/September 2016, attracting 3,231,000 unique listeners \(Rajar figures\), and was extracted in the Independent and Australian Financial Review. It was widely and favourably reviewed in the UK, Europe and America. Many reviews focused on the positive impact it would make in challenging reductionist readings of a multivalent condition. The Daily Mail reviewer wrote that ‘to a shy person, this book is incredibly cheering. It shows us we are not alone.’ The Observer called it ‘fantastic and involving … a feat of empathy’. Introducing Shrinking Violets as the Sunday Times ‘Thought Book of the Year’, the reviewer called it ‘beautifully written’ and ‘a strange and fascinating way to think about our shared humanity’. \(CS1\) 

 Before and after publication, Moran wrote articles on shyness for the Guardian, the Radio Times, The Conversation, the Daily Beast and other media, and blogged for Psychology Today. Readers’ comments on these pieces underline their impact: ‘What an unusual and beautiful description of shyness, seeing it as just a natural trait instead of something to be eradicated.’ \(CS2\) ‘Beautifully written piece … It struck so many chords with me.’ ‘I've learnt that most people are sympathetic to shyness because … we can all relate to it as this lovely article shows.’ \(CS3\) 

 Moran spoke about shyness at major literary festivals such as Words by the Water \(March 2017\), Ways with Words \(July 2018\) and Gladfest \(September 2019\), allowing him to engage with audiences in Q&As and book signings \(CS4\). ‘I went to your talk about shyness,’ one audience member wrote, ‘and it gave me an appreciation of my own … It has made me see my “strangenesses” in a new light.’ \(CS5\) He was interviewed about shyness by major publications in the Netherlands \(Volkskrant\), Denmark \(Weekendavisen\), Ireland \(Irish Examiner\), Spain \(El Mundo, El Pais\), Poland \(Charaktery\) and Italy \(La Repubblica\). An interview for the BBC website had over 280,000 unique browsers, its author commenting that ‘with Moran as its reluctant, mild\-mannered cheerleader, the Shy Pride movement may have just been born’. \(CS6\) Moran was also interviewed on BBC Radio 4, BBC World News, BBC World Service \(twice\), the Irish station Newstalk \(twice\), RTÉ Radio 2 \(twice\), ABC Australian Radio National \(three times\) and radio stations in Spain, Melbourne, Cape Town, Montreal and Salt Lake City, often interacting with listeners in call\-ins. Introducing Moran on BBC Radio 4’s Thinking Allowed, Laurie Taylor said that ‘in my insensitive, snap\-out\-of\-it extrovert way, I’ve never regarded \[shyness\] as meriting any great degree of personal or sociological attention, but a new and quite beautifully written book has changed all that’. \(CS7\) 

 Moran reached new audiences in diverse ways. He performed a stand\-up routine on shyness at the Liverpool Everyman Theatre \(Liverpool Bright Club, March 2017\); appeared alongside practitioners of ‘shy activism’ and autism awareness, Hamja Ahsan and Paul Wady, at the DIY Cultures Fair, Shoreditch \(May 2017\) and Writing on the Wall, Liverpool \(May 2018\); and contributed to Jamie Thom’s book A Quiet Education: Challenging the Extrovert Ideal in Our Schools \(John Catt, 2020\). 

 A significant strand of this impact targeted vulnerable groups who may find it hard to articulate their shyness. Moran was interviewed by Teen Breathe, a magazine promoting mental wellbeing in young people \(November 2018\), and for the Creative Introvert Podcast \(13 March 2018\). He spoke about shyness and masculinity at the Being a Man festival \(Southbank, November 2016\) and was interviewed on this subject by joe.co.uk \(18 November 2016\), melmagazine.com \(7 December 2016\) and the podcast The Modern Mann \(27 March 2017\). He also spoke to the careers site The Ladders about coping with shyness at work \(8 March 2017\), particularly in working environments that value dialogue and collaboration, by focusing on one\-to\-one interactions and prepared public speaking. He was interviewed by Canvas8 \(10 February 2017\), a behavioural insights practice offering paywalled resources for clients including Coca\-Cola and Unilever, on getting the best out of shy employees. This resulted in an internally circulated report, ‘The science of shyness’, in which Moran emphasised the importance of not seeing shyness as something to shake off but as a resilient and paradoxical condition. He gave talks about shyness in academia to PGR students at Birkbeck \(June 2016\) and LJMU \(November 2019\). 

 Web comments about Shrinking Violets evidence its impact on readers: ‘Inspiring and reassuring to know that others … suffer with shyness in ways similar or far more extreme than I have.’ ‘Shrinking Violets is not a miracle cure for shyness – it’s more like a hand reaching out to take yours, a reassurance that you're not alone.’ ‘Anyone who is shy, or knows someone who is ought to read this book to better understand themselves or others.’ \(CS8\) ‘Being shy I'm not sure I can articulate how good this book is … I don't think I've read anything as human as this about shyness.’ ‘I found this book a very positive encouragement … given how negatively shyness can be portrayed/viewed by the world at large.’ \(CS9\) 

 In the many letters and emails Moran received from readers, and comments on his own website, the positive personal impact of his work and its broadening of understanding were common themes: ‘Your book helped me I think overcome some difficulties, or at least better rationalize the human relations and my stand in interacting with others.’ ‘The best part about reading is where you come across something, a thought or feeling you had felt peculiar to yourself, written down by someone else, and they’ve expressed it in a way that perfectly synthesises your thoughts … Shrinking Violets gave me lots of those moments.’ \(CS5\) ‘It’s definitely altered how I feel about my own shyness, which I used to see as an ugly affliction that needed to be cured.’ ‘I understand \[my wife and daughter\] a bit better after reading your excellent book.’ ‘A remarkable achievement … as a shy and reserved person, I … valued your analysis and observations.’ ‘Your book helped show me that I ought to go easier on myself.’ \(CS10\) These responses evidenced a key argument of the book: that shyness is a condition that affects everyone differently but speaks to our common humanity.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Anziska’s research into the history of Palestinian statelessness has reached diverse public audiences across the Middle East, US and Europe, and his findings have reshaped contemporary policy discussions about the political horizons of the Israeli\-Palestinian conflict with policymakers, diplomats in the US and Europe, and leading Israeli and Palestinian officials. Anziska’s uncovering of vital new sources about the 1982 Lebanon War has led to the publication of primary archival material in an open source format in Arabic, Hebrew, and English in *The New York Review of Books, the Journal of Palestine Studies, Al\-Akhbar,* and *Jadaliyya.* These documents have fostered public debate over the legacy of US, Israeli, and Lebanese involvement in the Sabra and Shatila massacre across political divides in the Middle East. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In *Preventing Palestine: A Political History from Camp David to Oslo* \( **R1**\), Dr. Seth Anziska \(UCL’s Mohamed S. Farsi\-Polonsky Associate Professor of Jewish\-Muslim Relations since September 2015\) set out to answer how and why Palestinian statelessness persists despite longstanding efforts to address their quest for self\-determination. The project tackled a central conundrum in the field of 20th\-century international and global history, and brought local and regional narratives into conversation with one another. His research draws on Arabic, Hebrew, and English sources and explores diverse themes that include diaspora Jewish culture, inter\-Arab politics, domestic developments and the global Cold War, offering an award\-winning scholarly study that accounts for complex historical agency and traverses national divides \( **R1**\). 

 Anziska’s study revealed that, in the aftermath of decolonisation, during an era of mounting global attention to human rights, Palestinian claims for self\-determination began to receive a sympathetic hearing in the United States and Europe. Yet the negotiations over their political fate during the 1978 Camp David Accords served to undermine the prospect of sovereignty. Combining the political and conceptual history of Israel’s endorsement of limited autonomy, along with the physical expansion of the settlement project in the occupied territories and the military developments in Lebanon, the book \( **R1**\) and associated 2017 articles \( **R2**\) and \( **R3**\) reframe the early history of the peace process. *Preventing Palestine* re\-evaluates the Camp David summit and traces its impact on the limited political horizons for Palestinian sovereignty. The summit brought Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Egyptian President Anwar al\-Sadat, and U.S. President Jimmy Carter together for 13 intensive days of negotiations, and the result has often been depicted as Carter’s greatest diplomatic success. But the new sources uncovered by Anziska reveal a more troubling story about Palestinian political disenfranchisement that went hand in hand with the crafting of a bilateral peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. The rights of non\-Jewish residents in the occupied territories were relegated to separate discussions over autonomy between Egypt, Israel, and the United States \( **R3**\). The outcome of these talks stripped Palestinians of national or collective political sovereignty in favour of limited self\-rule, separating individuals from territory alongside the physical expansion of Israeli settlements. This legacy has real world consequences for the conflict today, as discussed in Anziska’s article on the Palestinian question in the era of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu \( **R2**\). 

 As the first scholar to utilise much of the most recently declassified sensitive historical material on the 1978 Camp David Accords and the 1982 Lebanon War, Anziska made these primary sources available as an online archival resource. *Sabra and Shatila: New Revelations* \( **R4**\), published in *The New York Review of Books* in 2018, contextualised and made accessible 400\+ pages of primary source material for those who cannot access archives directly, often for political reasons of limited access to Israel for Arab and Palestinian researchers. Anziska’s research \( **R1**\- **R4**\) combined diverse archival sources and literature, which are often siloed into disparate historical accounts. Drawing on newly declassified records obtained during extensive fieldwork, Anziska brought together sources from the Middle East, US, and UK. This methodological approach was anchored in qualitative archival research positioned across geographic divisions, disparate historiographies, and scattered repositories in Arabic, Hebrew, and English, giving voice to a cross\-section of local agents, ideologies and external powers.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Shaping and informing debate and discussion among policy experts** 

 Anziska’s research \( **R1**\) changed how the Palestinian question is considered by international policymakers, especially the concept of “autonomy,” undermining the perceptions of political stalemate with new historical insights and forcing a change in conversation and political debate over possible diplomatic outcomes that limit Palestinian self\-determination. In breaking with conventional interpretations of the Israeli\-Palestinian peace process, Anziska’s research garnered close critical engagement from across the political spectrum, forcing responses from leading Israeli and American diplomats as well as generating sustained public debate in the Arab world. Key stakeholders on the Israeli\-Palestinian conflict in the US, UK, and Middle East have organised discussions around this research \(particularly **R1** and **R4**\) and invited Anziska to consult on policy implications, shaping debate and discussion amongst policy experts on Palestinian statelessness. This policy impact has been especially notable for its global reach. 

 Between August 2018 and December 2019, Anziska spoke or gave briefings at ten policy events in five different countries to a total audience of approximately 800 people. These presentations helped shape the debate about the ways in which Palestine statelessness has been perpetuated and how it might be addressed. Anziska has presented his findings \( **R1**\) to government officials and policy experts from Palestine, Jordan, the USA, the UK, Norway, and Sweden, including in 2019, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, House of Lords, and in 2018, foreign policy advisors to US Senator Bernie Sanders. He spoke to audiences of 200\+ people alongside leading figures including former Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shlomo Ben Ami, Palestinian scholar Areej Sabbagh\-Khoury, and Sari Nusseibeh, a leading Palestinian political figure. In Washington, D.C., Anziska presented his findings to the Foundation for Middle East Peace \(FMEP\) and Middle East Institute \(21 September 2018\) to >150 attendees \(plus 796 views on YouTube 04/08/20 and 1075 listens on Soundcloud 12/08/20\) \( **A**\). FMEP’s goal was “to expose an audience of subject\-matter experts, diplomats, think tank analysts, and activists to Anziska’s research, in order to challenge them to think beyond the existing and past peace paradigms, and to energize and empower them to imagine what a serious, viable way forward will entail”. The President of the FMEP, confirms that it was “a tremendous success in achieving that goal” \( **B**\). They describe how “by shining a spotlight on root causes of the failure of peace efforts, \[Anziska\] has already contributed to the ongoing shift in the public discourse around Israel\-Palestine, including the push for a U.S. policy that demands greater accountability from Israel, including by putting conditions on U.S. foreign assistance” and asserts that “should there one day again be a U.S. administration that attempts to promote Israeli\-Palestinian peace, Anziska’s book will be an invaluable resource and tool for those pushing for a U.S. policy that is not a return to the failed approaches of the past, but one that is instead grounded in the lessons of history, including those \[of \( **R1**\)\]” \( **B**\). In London, Anziska presented on \( **R1**\) to a closed group of 25 guests at the European Council on Foreign Relations \(11 October 2018\), which included experts at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. His role in informing and shaping policy debate is indicated by a Policy Fellow at the Council: “Anziska’s book has been an indispensable resource which has shaped my own thinking and policy recommendations to European governments, particularly in relation to President Donald Trump’s ‘Deal of the Century’. I have also referenced his work in my own analysis of the US plan and frequently recommended ‘ *Preventing Palestine*’ to European diplomats” \( **C**\). Anziska worked with the U.S./Middle East Project \(USMEP\), a New York\- and London\-based independent policy institute to support their provision of non\-partisan analysis of the Middle East peace process and policy options to prevent conflict throughout the region. As a visiting fellow, Anziska briefed government officials, NGOs, and regional experts on his research findings bi\-annually since 2015 \(Israel Policy Forum, September 2018; Bruno Kreisky Forum, May 2019; Open Society Foundation, June 2017\). At the 2019 USMEP board meeting, he presented his findings \( **R1**\) as part of a closed door panel with the Palestinian Ambassador to the UK, a former US Ambassador to Egypt and Israel, and several other officials \(including a former Israeli Foreign Minister and a former head of the Mossad\). 

 The implications of Anziska’s research challenged received wisdom about the failure to take Palestinian political claims seriously, particularly among a new generation of Israeli policymakers. Both Israeli and Palestinian officials have engaged closely with \( **R1**\) and endorsed it publically. Former Israeli Ambassador to the US Itamar Rabinovich wrote in 2018 that “ *Preventing Palestine* is mandatory reading for understanding the complexities and ironies of the Israeli\-Palestinian conflict.” Palestine Liberation Organization \(PLO\) Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi has recommended Anziska’s work in high\-level meetings to senior donors of the Palestinian Authority and wrote that \( **R1**\) is ""an essential account of a reality obscured by hostile political agendas and unabashed bias. \[…\] \[A\] historical revelation of enormous magnitude.” Anziska has debated the implications of his findings with over a dozen mid\-career Israeli officials at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, MA \(September 2019\). The Senior Programme Manager who invited Anziska designs seminars to “strengthen leadership skills, cohort build and explore the American Jewish Community.” They describe Anziska’s research as an “essential perspective for \[the fellows\] to hear”, and explain how the session provided “a framework” to “be a bit more open to each other’s perspectives, and to step out of their own comfort zones”, enabling the fellows to reflect on their positions on the conflict by engaging in debate with Anziska and one another \( **D**\). Former US President Jimmy Carter reviewed a pre\-publication copy of Anziska’s manuscript, and his lead Israel/Palestine advisor at the Carter Center has relied on \( **R1**\) “to set the historical narrative straight for our own efforts to find a just solution to the conflict” when crafting policy reports and writing on the Center’s work in the region. The advisor states, “\[Anziska’s\] ideas have impacted our understanding of the very broad and structural principles undergirding current Palestinian statelessness”, which has led to “a more careful and nuanced use of such concepts as self\-rule, autonomy and sovereignty” in the Center’s internal and external communications \( **E**\). In commenting on the presentation of these findings at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute in 2019, the advisor added, “Anziska must be credited for engaging with members of the public who were not always sympathetic to his conclusions and were even hostile, challenging his research” \( **E**\). 

 **Creating open\-access archives for Arabic\-, English\- and Hebrew\-reading audiences** 

 Anziska’s activities have shaped public awareness over the fate of Palestinian self\-determination by making archival material available for the first time to an audience of the Arabic\-, English\- and Hebrew\-reading public. The material Anziska discovered is now widely available online in an open access format \( **R4**\) hosted by *The New York Review of Books* \(>100,000 readers\), which provides an opportunity for the wider public to inspect sensitive archival material. This is particularly significant because for political reasons the majority of Arab and Palestinian populations have limited access to Israel and its archives. It was also published in the *Journal of Palestine Studies* and the leading Middle East\-focused online platform *Jadaliyya*, with scholarly essays introducing the primary material in both cases. These publications deepened public understanding by providing an online repository for the broader, Arabic\-, English\- and Hebrew\-reading public to examine the roots of political violence in the 1982 War, the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian civilians by Christian Phalange militiamen under Israeli control, and the consequences of this violence. Lebanon’s leading *Al\-Akhbar* newspaper \(circulation 90,000\) featured Arabic translations of Anziska’s findings on the front page \(29 September 2018\) and an interview with Anziska which generated public discussion of the findings, reflected in reviews of \( **R1**\) \( **F**\) and wider Arabic media coverage such as in *An\-Nahar* newspaper \(2 October 2018\) \( **G**\). In the context of Lebanese politics this attention and dissemination is especially notable, given the political importance of the warlords who carried out the violence in 1982 and are now in power. Positive reviews of \( **R4**\) in Hebrew journals and newspapers, as well as continued availability of the material online, signals that this research is shaping memorialization practices in Israel, where much of this topic remains highly charged and under\-addressed by scholars. In *The Regional Thinking Forum*, one reviewer discussed the way \( **R1**\) is reshaping how Israel understands its past and engagement with the peace process: “From the historical perspective it offers, one can better see the profound change that has taken place in the Israeli public in the last two decades” \( **F**\). The provenance of the documents Anziska unearthed were discussed in the leading Israeli newspaper *Yedioth Ahoronoth* in February 2020 \( **F**\), while reviewers in *Haaretz* called the work “meticulously researched” in a featured 2019 essay looking at the way this history has shaped the discourse around Palestinian statehood today \( **F**\). 

 **Shaping public awareness of Palestinian statelessness** 

 Anziska’s activities have shaped public awareness over the fate of Palestinian self\-determination and have reached a large international audience. Between \( **R1**\)’s release in 2018 and the end of the impact period, Anziska sold over 2000 hardback \(a paperback version was published in March 2020\). As an indication of the regional and global reach of the research, the Institute for Palestine Studies in Beirut are producing an Arabic trade press translation of *Preventing Palestine*, intended for a general readership. The book has been the subject of leading current and religious affairs podcasts, including the *Tel Aviv Review* \(26 November 2018\) and *The Sacred* \(14 November 2018, 1851 listens on Soundcloud alone\). There have also been over fifty published reviews and discussions of \( **R1**\), in more than five languages \(including French, Spanish, German, Norwegian and Dutch\). This includes leading print and online outlets such as *The Guardian, The Financial Times, Haaretz, The Jordan Times, Orient XXI, The New Rambler Review, the Los Angeles Review of Books, the Cairo Review of Books, Al\-Akhbar, and Yediot Aharonth* \( **F**\). The book generated responses ranging from a featured review by US diplomat Dennis Ross in *Foreign Policy* to critical reviews in the Arabic press. This engagement with Anziska’s research in the international press has forced a reconsideration of received wisdom about Palestinian statelessness and the future of the conflict across the political spectrum. The conversation it has engendered is indicated by \( **R1**\)’s treatment by *Fathom* \(‘For a deeper understanding of Israel and the region’\). In February 2019, *Fathom* published a critical review of \( **R1**\) as part of an exchange format whereby part 1 constituted the review and part 2, Anziska’s response to it. In using this conversation\-based format, *Fathom* acknowledged \( **R1**\)’s role in shaping public debate about Palestinian statelessness. Even those who disagreed with the findings, such as the author of part 1, recognized the contribution of the work. ""The book must receive the credit it deserves,” wrote the author, a former Israeli legal advisor at Camp David. “Anziska did a very good research job and has collected and pieced together an enormous amount of information, including information derived from newly\-declassified American and Israeli records, some of which even an avid consumer of books related to the Middle East peace process like me has not previously seen"" \( **F,** p.25\). *Fathom* published a further piece on \( **R1**\) in June 2019, demonstrating its continued relevance to their audience. Anziska’s research also featured in a documentary made for France TV/3 Via Stella: *Camp David: La Prix de la Paix* \( **H**\), which aired in 2019. The director wrote, “ *Preventing Palestine: A Political History from Camp David to Oslo* has been one of my main sources for the writing of the screenplay of this film and the dialogue we had with Dr. Anziska before the shooting of interview was crucial \[…\] everything you can hope for as a documentary director: a great insight on the subject expressed in a clear, straightforward and concise way.” \( **I**\). In recognition of its importance, *Preventing Palestine* has been awarded the British Association of Jewish Studies Best Book of 2019, named one of the “best human rights books of 2018” by the Hong Kong Free Press, and included by the Forward in a list of books that US officials “should have read” before unveiling their troubling diplomatic initiative in January 2020 \( **F**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Positive Behavioural Support \(PBS\) is a person\-centred approach to providing long\-term support for people with behaviours that challenge, such as those living with a learning disability and/or autism. Research from Northumbria University has led to the development of a novel workforce development \(WFD\) model, which directly addresses training limitations in PBS. Rather than training individuals, the WFD model focuses on system\-wide organisational and capability development, to effectively equip the health and social care workforce with the skills to use PBS. The WFD approach is comprised of accredited PBS programmes, PBS awareness sessions, new clinical leadership roles, and a community of practice. It has been applied across a workforce of more than 25,000 people and resulted in a shift in organisational culture, leading to more competent care professionals who are now able to use PBS confidently in their practice. This change has improved the lives of thousands of individuals living with a learning disability and/or autism and led to organisational benefits, such as increased staff retention.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Following scandals of abuse in private hospitals, the UK Government has recommended that individuals with behaviours that challenge \(BtC\) are transferred to community\-based care \( *Transforming Care* Programme, 2014\). For this policy to succeed, however, the community care workforce needs to be well prepared to care for individuals with learning disability and/or autism, some of whom may display BtC such as self\-harm or aggression. Positive Behavioural Support \(PBS\), which is a positive, person\-centred, values\-based approach that encourages long\-term positive changes in behaviour, supports people with BtC and improves their quality of life. However, there is a lack of skills, capacity and strategic implementation of PBS within the community care workforce, ultimately affecting the quality of care on offer. Researchers at Northumbria have addressed this issue by developing a workforce development \(WFD\) model to upskill the community care workforce in PBS \[ **R1**\- **R6**\]. 

 Traditionally, social care organisations have adopted short\-term, individually focused staff training models, with little consideration for organisational complexity, the development needs at all levels of the care system, or the high staff turnover in the sector. This has led to inconsistency in the provision, quality, accreditation, and transferability of training. In 2016, Health Education England \(HEE\) and Health Education North East commissioned the multidisciplinary team of Northumbria University researchers to develop a unique whole\-system WFD approach to upskill the social care workforce in PBS. As part of the research, the team uncovered an inconsistent approach to learning, teaching, developing, and assessing PBS competence, and an inability to demonstrate the competencies required to provide PBS \[ **R1**\]. 

 The aim of the WFD development process was to identify the competencies the community care workforce needs to support people with BtC, such as how to develop rapport with an individual, use effective communication strategies or address the behaviours. Uniquely in this type of research and intervention, a key step in the process devised by the Northumbria team was the exploration of the views of individuals with a learning disability \[ **R2**\] and their family carers \[ **R3**\], to understand the features of high\-quality support that make a difference to them. Both groups highlighted aspects that were consistent with key components of PBS: the importance for individuals to be supported by staff skilled in the technical aspects of PBS; to be treated with respect, dignity, consistency, open communication; and to have meaningful relationships with care staff. These positive approaches can help many individuals to live a life that can include employment, education, independent living and good relationships with family and friends: to ‘feel like just a normal person’ \[ **R2**\]. Family carers additionally acknowledged the valuable role of staff who provided emotional support to them as carers and emphasised how crucial high levels of staff knowledge and competence were to successful outcomes. They also talked of the difficulties for staff working within a wider ‘system’ and saw it as important that the staff should be supported by the system in using positive approaches in their work. This highlighted the need to develop and deliver a system\-wide WFD approach to PBS \[ **R3**\]. In a second stage, these findings were compared against the competencies highlighted in the PBS Competence Framework, which is a detailed framework of the skills, knowledge and actions required to deliver PBS effectively, previously developed by the team \[ **R1**\]. This was used to assess the existing competency levels of the current and future workforce to understand their strengths and development needs \[ **R1**\]. 

 The success of the Government’s *Transforming Care* policy, and implementation of a PBS approach, was also challenged by the difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff, which has an adverse effect on the quality and continuity of care \[ **R1**, **R4**\]. The research team developed recommendations to increase recruitment and reduce staff turnover, including improving the nature and quality of training, providing better support and supervision for staff and creating a more positive organisational culture \[ **R1**, **R4**\]. This research highlighted the need to build capacity within the workforce to provide positive values\-based, high\-quality supervision and support to staff, enabling them to use similar approaches with those they support. 

 Northumbria’s research \[ **R1**\- **R4**\] led to the development of a comprehensive evidence\-based WFD PBS programme in the North East of England in 2017 \(reviewed in detail in section 4\), implemented by a Steering Group, which consisted of multiple stakeholders, including the Northumbria research team, PBS practitioners, NHS and carer representatives. The programme created the infrastructure for upskilling the workforce in PBS and for promoting a wider organisational culture change to sustain it. An evaluation of the programme identified significant benefits of this approach in relation to: organisational changes, such as in strategy and policies; staff knowledge, confidence and practice; and improved quality of life for people with a learning disability/autism and their families \[ **R5**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Northumbria research ‘ *directly informed’* an ‘ *innovative and evidence\-based PBS WFD model’* for the North East and Cumbria \[ **E1**\], which is home to over 25,000 employees within 19 local authorities, 3 large hospital trusts, many independent service provider organisations and other stakeholders, supporting approximately 65,000 people with learning difficulties and their families. The impact is manifest in 1\) the implementation of PBS WFD across the region, leading to strategic and structural improvements; 2\) an accredited educational provision; and 3\) improvements in the lives of people with learning difficulties and/or autism and their families. 

 **4.1 Implementation of PBS WFD: Strategic and Structural Improvements** 

 Northumbria’s WFD for upskilling the workforce in PBS \[ **R1**\], approved by the Government’s Transforming Care Board \[ **E2**, p2\] in 2016, has informed regional strategy in NHS England and HEE for the North East and Cumbria. Judith Thompson \(Network Lead for North East and Cumbria Learning Disability Network, NHS\) and Charlotte Carr \(Learning Disability Workforce Specialist, HEE\) note that *‘the research was unique in adopting a systemic, multi\-component approach… to increase and sustain workforce competence in PBS in the region, in a manner that could be grown at scale’* \[ **E1**, p1\]. This WFD programme was delivered through the 2017 North East and Cumbria Learning Disability and Autism Workforce Strategy \[ **E1**; **E3**, p8\]. 

 Key to the delivery of this strategy was a restructure of the WFD staffing framework, including the creation of new clinical leaders \(headcount: 3\) and PBS Senior Clinical trainers \(headcount: 2\) \[ **E1**, p2\]. The three new WFD clinical leadership positions are strategic roles to implement and manage the regional infrastructure to support practice\-based learning \[ **E1**, p2\]. Moreover, this strategy established a workplace culture more enabling of WFD through the creation of the North East and Cumbria PBS Community of Practice, made up of PBS practitioners, stakeholders, and family carers, to provide a virtual space to make resources accessible and share best practice \[ **E1**, p2; **E3**, p8; **E4**, p13\]. The new environment was supported by new values\-based interviewing to appoint staff and resilience training to help staff deal with the stress of supporting people with BtC \[ **E1**, p3\]. The managers also established the requirement for including staff competence in PBS in commissioning specifications \[ **E1**, p2\]. The two new PBS Senior Clinical Trainers were appointed to deliver a programme of PBS awareness sessions across the North East and Cumbria region \[ **E1**\]. 

 Northumbria’s recommendations to address high staff turnover \[ **R5**\] have been adopted by NHS England across the North East region to increase staff recruitment and retention in social care settings \[ **E1**\] and as a result of the system wide focus of the PBS WFD, organisations have embraced new ways of recruiting, supporting and managing staff, including the application of PBS principles to the staff team \[ **E1**; **E5**; **E6**, p6\], resulting in improved retention \[ **E4**, p41\]. Many organisations have *‘introduced new, or adapted existing, policies to make PBS a central component’* \[ **E6**, p6\] or changed the way in which poor staff performance was addressed and managed, for example, differences in ‘ *things like disciplinaries and investigations because we are taking into account…whether we’ve provided them with everything that we could have for them to have been able to deal with that situation differently’* \[ **E6**, p7\]. These organisational changes have helped improve staff turnover, motivation and lower staff sickness levels \[ **E1**; **E4**; p41, p47; **E5**; **E6**, p7\]. 

 **4.2 Implementation of the PBS WFD: accredited educational provision and improved practice** 

 Northumbria University were commissioned by the NHS to develop and deliver three new free\-of\-charge accredited programmes aligned with the 2015 PBS Competence Framework and competencies identified by the research \[ **R1**\]. 317 staff from 30 local and national social care organisations involved in the provision of support to people with learning disability and/or autism \- including organisational practice leaders, practice facilitators who lead teams and support workers \- completed the programmes between 2018\-2020, and a further 60 NHS staff undertook the programme in 2020 \[ **E1**, p2\]. The programmes, delivered through a blended learning approach \(face\-to\-face, online, practice\-based learning, peer support\) are based on a cascade model, whereby organisational leads \(undertaking the ‘Leading PBS’ qualification\) provide supervision and support to managerial staff \(undertaking the ‘Facilitating PBS in teams’ qualification\), who in turn provide support to front\-line support staff \(undertaking the ‘Competence in PBS’ qualification\) \[ **E4**, p13\]. Participants of the training programmes were also supervised by the WFD clinical leaders \[ **E3**, p8; **E7**, p5\]. Thompson \(NHS\) and Carr \(HEE\) explained that ‘ *The cascade model on which the programmes are explicitly built mean that the learning has benefited thousands of staff and people with a learning disability’* \[ **E1**, p2\]. In addition, 15 people completed a bespoke Post Graduate Certificate in Teaching and Learning in Professional Practice for NHS PBS specialists, developed and delivered by Northumbria in 2017, to enable participants to use best practice in evidence\-based learning and teaching methods for adult education \[ **E1**, p2; **E3**, p8\]. 

 As a result of participating in the PBS programmes, staff reported an increase in confidence and knowledge \[ **E1**, p2; **E5**\], with learning from the programmes directly relevant to practice \[ **E4**, p7\]. A programme participant reflected: ‘ *The course was truly transformative. We thought we knew a lot about PBS, but we learnt so much more, all of which is completely translatable to the workplace. We have already noticed the difference what we have learnt is making within the organisation’* \[ **E8**, p3\]. The evaluation identified organisational changes implemented as a result of the programme, including introducing new or adapting existing policies to make PBS a central component \[ **E4**, p37\]. It also confirmed significant improvements in staff practice \[ **E4**, p51\]. Carr \(HEE\) noted *: ‘the skills the people have learned have really empowered them to be able to offer a really, really good quality of support to people’* \[ **E9**\]. Improvements include reductions in restrictive and aversive approaches, such as physical intervention \[ **E5**\]. Thompson \(NHS\) and Carr \(HEE\) described: ‘ *A significant shift towards staff viewing behaviours that challenge as learned behaviours \(that can therefore be influenced by changing the person’s environment\) rather than as being something inherent to the person’* \[ **E1**, p3\]. 

 The PBS awareness\-sessions run by the new PBS Senior Clinical Trainers have also had an impact on staff skills. 781 people from 102 different organisations from the community and voluntary sector, local authorities, NHS, police, Care Quality Commission, universities, and colleges \[ **E7**, p5; **E10**, p2\], and 16 family carers attended these free 3\-hour sessions. Attendees appreciated the value of the content and noted that it was useful to apply in practice \[ **E10**, p7\-10\]. One attendee commented that *‘This session gives staff an insight in how their behaviour has an impact on people we support’* \[ **E10**, p9\]. 

 **4.3 Improved lives for people with a learning disability/autism and their families** 

 The creation of the PBS WFD programme has led to improvements in staff practice, which in turn benefits the people with a learning disability and/or autism who the staff are caring for \[ **E1**\]. The programme structure educated participants to change their practice and impacted the culture within organisations, which ultimately affects the lives of the people they work with. Carr \(HEE\) observed that ‘ *Thousands of peoples’ lives have been touched in some way by this program*’ \[ **E9**, p3\]. In their testimonial, Thompson and Carr comment that: 

 ‘*staff developed and implemented behaviour support plans that used positive, less restrictive approaches…\[that are\]…more person\-centred and tailored to individual and developed in collaboration with them* \[leading to\] *improvements in quality of life of people with a learning disability, including increased and more meaningful contact with families and reductions in behaviours that challenge”* \[ **E1**, p2\]. 

 For example, a senior staff member commenting on the PBS programme was able to see the positive changes delivered through the new approaches as being responsible for *‘a 50 percent reduction in \[challenging\] behaviour, which is amazing’* \[ **E6**, p8\]. 

 These improvements are, in part, because organisations are becoming better at engaging with families of people with BtC, involving them with interventions and reducing the BtC enough to allow families to engage in activities again. An example of a positive outcome of PBS on one individual was described by a programme participant: *‘He has choice, he has control, he has independence … because of this greater family input. He’s able to spend a lot of time at home with his family where that wasn’t possible before’* \[ **E4**, p41\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 The research, a critical disability studies perspective informed by notions about how the power of objects, senses and discourse are able to stimulate and provoke thought, language and writing, has raised awareness of writing strategies that can inform the visual arts and creative writing in general. The beneficiaries of this research are, directly, dyslexic creatives and those working in dyslexia support, and indirectly, children, young people and adults. Particular communities include those around East London, Leeds and Ilkley.

1.  **Underpinning research** 

 **The nature of the research insights or findings which relate to the impact claimed in the case study.** 

  

 Notions about the power of objects, senses and discourses to stimulate and provoke thought, language and writing are informed and enhanced through a critical disability studies lens, deconstructing definitions of ‘good’ writers, ‘academic’ writing and ‘creative’ writing. Writers/creatives with dyslexia often experience representations of themselves that significantly affect their self\-image as writers \(Tobias\-Green, 2014\). Writing is a rich, valid, inclusive form of creative communication. Notions of normalcy and hierarchies of writing are disrupted by questioning and re\-positioning words and ideas: writer, maker, learner, creator, producer, individual, collective: all challenged through visual culture and arts education \(Tobias\-Green, 2017\) 

  

 Rather than make binary visual and verbal literacy, tactile engagement with materials, objects and sensory experiences can develop writing across the arts and beyond. Dividing writing into categories suggests a rightness of being that rejects complexity and discourse. This research/writing practice rejects simple binaries and is applied to exploring dyslexia and writing. It does not consider people to be homogenous, revealing that underlying discourses rely on normative narratives, which are critically pulled apart by the tactile, inclusive, sensory, experiential and playful elements of their approach to writing. 

  

 The synthesis of critical visual studies and disability studies employed in developing the research is important in shaping and unpicking narratives around writing in an art institution and beyond. This thinking questions the identity of writing in the art school and, in the spaces provided by the tactile writing workshop, allows participants to carve out new identities \(Tobias\-Green 2014\). The research contributes to the de\-territorialising of dyslexia, writing and disability. 

 **An outline of what the underpinning research produced by the submitted unit was** 

  

 Interactive workshops aim to deepen writing skills by exploring how objects, words and language interact in making visual/textual connections. They assail the barriers between image and text to explore the tactile, aesthetic qualities of writing. The research method provides opportunities to interact with writing, materials and text in purposeful, non\-threatening environments. Participants produce and share collages of text and visuals and are facilitated to interact playfully and imaginatively with extracts of philosophical, sociological writing. 

 Participants include further and higher education students anxious about re/entering the university power structure, tutors of students with dyslexia who felt unable to engage in any kind of meaningful, enjoyable writing experience, and participants outside the University, who had not written for years or who did not see themselves as writers. Workshops aim to heal the ‘fracturing of intent between visual and textual language’ \(Tobias\-Green, 2014, p.194\). The recognition that the impetus to write freely is provoked by a loosening up of the tactile, sensory body and its engagement with object, materials, language and senses is widely documented \(Tobias\-Green, 2014, 2017\). 

 **Any relevant key contextual information about this area of research.** 

 The workshops’ underpinning methodologies grew from Tobias\-Green’s extensive experience as English tutor and dyslexia specialist teacher, the teaching of narrative and visual language within the University, and their own creative writing practice, forming the basis for their research. This multiple positionality provides an understanding of some conflicts and anomalies writers in the art school and beyond \(with dyslexic diagnoses and without\) experience in their multiple identities \- student, dyslexic, artist, writer, tutor.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Beneficiaries/publics** 

 Beneficiaries of the research are those working in the wider writing community with artist/writers who may have dyslexia/traits of dyslexia whether diagnosed or not, workshop facilitators, tutors working with writers with dyslexia in universities and beyond, members of the public attending literature festivals, specialist dyslexia festivals and community arts venues.  Students at Leeds Arts University have benefited from the research, whether diagnosed with dyslexia or undiagnosed, including the students who study on postgraduate and undergraduate programmes and all students who study on the BA \(hons\) in Creative Writing \(written and taught by Tobias\-Green and arising from this research\). 

 **Dissemination of research** 

-  Yorkshire Dyslexia Tutors’ Forum seminar and workshop \(2016\) for tutors run by Tobias\-Green and Byrne \- an arts writer and dyslexia specialist teacher **.** Work was presented to a group of 8 freelance dyslexia specialist tutors through a presentation and a demonstration of the tactile writing workshop so that attendees could then deploy these strategies themselves. 

-  Tobias\-Green ran a workshop for artist/writers with dyslexia as part of the International Festival of Dyslexic Culture, London, 2015. 

-  Tobias\-Green ran a tactile writing workshop as part of the Ilkley Literature Festival in 2018. 

-  Tobias\-Green ran a workshop for artist writers wishing to develop their creative writing skills at Hyde Park Book Club, Headingley, Leeds in 2019. 

 **Yorkshire Dyslexia Tutors’ Forum seminar and workshop \(2016\)** 

 Attendees reported: **‘**The presentation, delivered by Karen and colleague Joanna Byrne, demonstrated the sense of responsibility and ownership dyslexic participants in workshops can feel around their writing despite their doubts and anxieties, the value and purpose of writing, and an understanding of how through the process of engaging with these areas participants are able to gain control and develop strategies for accessing a wide range of knowledge and information to support their writing. The insight given by Karen into the tactile writing workshop provided valuable strategies for making writing accessible, creative and productive. As an aside, as a participant, it was also a fun and engaging session and encouraged the group to be playful as well as think creatively.’* **\[1\]** 

 **International Festival of Dyslexic culture, London, 2015.** 

  

 Work was presented to 12 members of the general public with dyslexia, who were interested in writing and creativity, through a presentation and a demonstration of the workshop so attendees could deploy these strategies themselves. 

 **Attendees reported:  Changes in their perception of their behaviours around writing and their approach to self\-image and writing:** 

 **‘**I attended Karen’s workshop as part of ‘The Festival of Dyslexia’ in London. Within the workshop, we were given ‘permission’ to write without worrying about our spelling, this could be looked at a later date. This approach is refreshing and one I have tried myself, but to hear this from a professional, working in the field of Dyslexia helped me validate my own feelings. From an analytical point of view asking, “what cheese or art work would you be?” was interesting, it made me think of art in collections we will never see, stolen art, perhaps, what art would be can only be answered in terms of what has gone before, what I have knowledge of. Being invited to feel material and ask questions of the haptic nature of the fabric was really interesting, and perhaps limited by the vocabulary of the writer, but to question the nature of fabric, the senses of touch noise and smell, helped to see those elements come together under one roof, of ‘fabric’ I could see that relationship coming together. I enjoy workshops of this nature, it is a time I can forget my dyslexic spelling, relax, and write without judgement.’ **\[2\]** 

 **Ilkley literature festival** 

 **17 Members of the general public interested in writing and creativity.** 

 **Attendees reported:** ‘Karen provided exceptionally thoughtful, sensitive, generous and positive support for writing my MA dissertation. She listened well and gave excellent feedback and advice. She is widely read in appropriate and useful academic perspectives and guided me effectively through these complex fields of enquiry. For all these reasons I was drawn to the workshop she gave at the most recent Ilkley Literature Festival, which was stimulating and fun and produced a poem about being a carer, which I published on my website at*  [*lesleyeleanorwood.com/2018/10/07/the\-friends/*](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flesleyeleanorwood.com%2F2018%2F10%2F07%2Fthe-friends%2F&data=02%7C01%7Ckaren.tobias-green%40leeds-art.ac.uk%7C828670222c3a4dbcca0808d639a6b18e%7C9892a357668347cf9a82c80f90d97bf5%7C1%7C0%7C636759785434150546&sdata=SiaBTzaLU29rDVUsX5mLYuIy8ZDp88tvgTkhYZIbhKE%3D&reserved=0) *’* **\[3,4,5\].** 

 **Tactile Writing at Hyde Park Book Club \(2019\)** 

 Tobias\-Green presented their tactile writing workshop to a varied group of artist/writers with an interest in disability and inclusivity. 

 Attendees reported: *‘I saw the Tactile Writing Workshop at Hyde Park Book Club and was tempted to explore what it had to offer. It was unusual in that the table was covered with craft objects: pens, papers, postcards, glue, wool etc. How could I write with those? What would we be doing? There is a tendency to feel a bit self\-conscious when you are not sure what will happen. However it was really fun. The facilitator really encouraged everyone to use the materials and to enable me to speak and write what they evoked and created associations with. It was surprising and I thoroughly enjoyed it as I am sure the others who attended did too. There are more ways to create narratives or poetry and meaning than just putting pen to paper.’* **\[6\]** 

 *‘The workshop/presentation was a helpful, insightful session drawing attention to the strategies used by the facilitator to make writing accessible, creative and productive. Care was taken to involve all participants and to move from the acts of tactile engagement with materials to communicating, through spoken language, to conveying meaning in the written word. Participants felt relaxed and enabled enough to read their work out loud and to join in conversation about the nature of creativity, writing and \(where appropriate\) disability’.*

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Bolton’s research in public sector management and strategic planning significantly impacted sport policy in Wales and, by stimulating and informing policy debate, changed Welsh Government policy. Specifically, evaluation of the Free Swimming Initiative and Active Young People Programmes \- which together involved 45% of the Welsh population \- resulted in a revised Free Swimming Scheme, the diversion of funds to the £5.4m Healthy and Active Fund, and concomitant developments associated with the launch of the *Healthy Weight, Healthy Wales* National Strategy.  Meanwhile, evaluation of the Calls for Action programme, which involved c35,000 participants and c4,000 activity leaders, was undertaken using Theory of Change, the first time such a technique had been utilised in relation to the evaluation and design of national sport funded programmes.  This subsequently influenced how other such programmes, including the £1.3M 60\+ Active Leisure Scheme and the £8M 2020 Sport Resilience Fund, were developed, and how their effectiveness was measured.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Bolton has conducted research in the area of policy and strategic planning in the public sector since 2002 \[e.g. R1\] and has developed a large portfolio of evaluation research focussed on the policies of the Welsh Government \(WG\) and the WG sponsored body, Sport Wales.  Sport Wales is the national organisation responsible for developing and promoting sport and physical activity in Wales.  It is the main adviser to WG on sport and supports the delivery of national strategic priorities in this area. 

 Between 2004 and 2008, Bolton was commissioned to undertake evaluation research on two national pilot schemes, *Active Young People* \(AYP\) \[R2\] and the *Free Swimming Initiative* \(FSI\) which together involved 45% of the Welsh population. The evaluation of these schemes, valued at over £200k, was central to *Climbing Higher*, WG’s 2005 national strategy to increase participation in sport and physical activity.  *Inter alia*, research undertaken highlighted the challenges faced in standalone policy interventions and concluded that achieving ambitious targets for population\-wide physical activity levels would require strategies that encompass a wider range of opportunities to exercise \[R3\]. The research also highlighted that monitoring and evaluation methods for Free Swimming did not facilitate accountability against objectives for either Sport Wales or the participating organisations and suggested improved frameworks and measures to address this.  Their adoption led to significant improvements in data collection \[R3\]. 

 In the Minister for Culture and Sport’s 2014\-15 Remit Letter, WG requested that Sport Wales conduct a review into initiatives including the FSI and AYP \(which have a combined worth of c£110m\), to refine and align them with evolving Welsh priorities.  This led, in 2016, to a second tranche of funded research totalling £90k, into FSI and AYP with Bolton as the sport management specialist \[R4\].  The research concluded that the projects were “…not yet explicitly linked to the achievement of the seven national wellbeing goals or to the priorities set out in the Welsh Government’s ‘Prosperity for All’ agenda…” and recommended that future policy should make these the key reference points for any change. Further, it recommended that a range of modes of physical activity and recreation be integrated and linked to broader policy and wellbeing objectives, in line with the WG’s Wellbeing of Future Generations Act \(WBFGA\). Introduced by WG in 2015, the WBFGA is a pivotal piece of legislation that requires Welsh public bodies to work together towards improving the wellbeing of Wales through the principle of sustainable development. 

 The Remit Letter also requested Sport Wales to consider programmes that would *narrow the participation gap*.  This led to the launch of the £3m Phase 2 of the Calls for Action programme \(C4A\) with the specific aim of targeting inequalities.  In a notable shift in direction from Phase 1, and in order to meet WG requirements, Sport Wales established four separate and much more explicit objectives for Phase 2 projects.  These included working with women and girls, those living in poverty, those living with a disability and BAME communities.  Taken together, the Phase 2 C4A projects attracted c35,000 participants and some 4,000 activity leaders. 

 Bolton was the sport management lead for the core team that was awarded £140k funding to undertake a three\-year programme of evaluation research into C4A between 2016 and 2019.  In a departure from previous sport management evaluation research, Bolton and the team recognised that the use of a Theory of Change approach would allow them to draw meaningful links between C4A interventions and process, and the achievement of outcomes and broader objectives.  This ensured that ongoing feedback and organisational learning were built into the evaluation.  The co\-development of a Theory of Change approach with policymakers and practitioners enabled them to clarify what they were seeking to achieve, to promote a better understanding among partner organisations \(which have different priorities for and perspectives on an intervention\) and, where necessary, advocate changes in real time. \[R5\]\[R6\]

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Two distinct areas of impact related to Bolton’s evaluation research are evident in the period: Impact on public policy \-* policy debate has been stimulated and informed by Bolton’s research, leading to a change in policy direction. 

 *Impacts on practitioners \-  the way projects are delivered and measured has improved due to the introduction by Bolton and her team of a Theory of Change methodology to Sport Wales funded programmes. 

 <ins>Impact on Public Policy</ins> 

 Bolton’s research **created a shift in sport policy and its delivery** by helping Sport Wales and its partners align their management approaches with the delivery of the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act and the recommendations of the 2017 Independent Review of Sport Wales commissioned by WG. 

 The 2017 Independent Review \[E1\] had noted that Sport Wales was viewed as *“an organisation at a crossroads in its strategic direction and the role it plays in the delivery of wellbeing goals and government policy…However, the increasing focus on sport’s contribution to the wider policy priorities, in a climate of reduced public expenditure budgets, requires Sport Wales to lead the sector through transformational change.”*  The review recommended the preparation of a new strategy that would lead the sector and reflect a wider agenda to include new ways of working. 

 Drawing on the C4A evaluation undertaken by Bolton and her team, the Independent Review noted that C4A was a “refreshing departure” from the norm.  The C4A evaluation had from the outset established a focus on organisational learning, that formed a key tenet of the “real time” evaluation process which featured significantly in the first report to the Sport Wales Board in January 2016.  In November 2018, Sports Wales’ Director of Community Engagement presented to the Board on key learning from the evaluation of C4A and its influence on the emerging Sport Wales national strategy \[E2\].  The report specifically referred to Governance and Partnerships, the thematic area led by Bolton and noted that “learning to date has been used to inform the approach adopted by the Healthy & Active Fund \(HAF\)”, a £5.4m WG investment fund delivered jointly by Sport Wales and Public Health Wales.  Minutes from the meeting confirm that “learning from C4A would be embedded within the new strategy” \[E3\]. 

 Bolton’s team also undertook two other significant research evaluations.  Firstly, the Free Swimming \(FSI\) review \(June 2018\) \[R4\] concluded “evidence suggests that the current approach to free swimming is not the most cost\-effective way to use the £3 million pa allocated to it…it is no longer fit for purpose.”.  This led to dialogue between Sport Wales, WG and key stakeholders resulting in a revised scheme for Free Swimming and the diversion of some funds to the Healthy & Active Fund.  Secondly, the recommendations of the 2019 Young People Programmes Review \(YPPR\) \[E4\] were publicly endorsed in the Sport Wales 2018\-19 Annual Report \[E5\].  Concomitant developments associated with the launch of the *Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales* national strategy and an agreed new fund of £1.3 million to support an over 60s Active Leisure Scheme, emerged directly from Bolton’s evaluation research findings \[E6\]. 

 <ins>Impact on Practitioners</ins> 

 The use of a Theory of Change approach in the evaluation of C4A was the first time such a technique was utilised in relation to the evaluation and design of national sport funded programmes.  Importantly, it was highly successful in assessing the extent to which the original policy drivers had been met.  Furthermore, it had a positive impact on the organisations sponsored through C4A, allowing them to learn from each other and by facilitating cross\-fertilisation of an enhanced experience for both the organisations themselves and, indirectly, their diverse end users \[E7\].  Its use had been driven by the team’s initial evaluation of the FSI \[R3\] which had highlighted that the existence of multiple objectives posed a significant challenge when evaluating the initiative.  When developing a system of evaluation for C4A the team identified the use of Theory of Change as a way to provide a common approach which shifted the focus to outcomes rather than inputs and outputs, hitherto commonplace in Sport Wales performance management. 

 The use of Theory of Change techniques has subsequently become an expected norm for Sport Wales and its principal partners and has become a core tool used in the development and evaluation of its programmes.  This has included the 2020 Free Swimming Independent Progress Monitoring Exercise \(£60k\), the invitation to tender for which states an expectation of the use of a Theory of Change approach to “ *help us to understand what sort of data we need…to help us learn.*”; the 2019 evaluation of the Healthy & Active Fund \(£5.4m\) which required the use of Theory of Change at both programme and project level; the 2019 Review of National Lottery Community Grant Scheme **,** which adopted a Theory of Change approach in order to focus on outcomes; and, the development of both the 2020 60\+ Active Leisure Scheme \(£1.3M\) and the 2020 Sport Resilience Fund \(£8M\) which also used a Theory of Change approach. \[E8\] 

 Collectively, Bolton’s research has had significant impact across a number of Sport Wales and Welsh Government policy initiatives with its ongoing impact evidenced through the funding secured for two KESS2 projects \(totalling £118k\).  The first is examining barriers to participation for young disadvantaged females.  The second is examining the cross\-sectional working, required by the WBFGA, of Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales to achieve sustainable gains in the areas of health and physical activity.

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 65,000 people in the UK have end stage renal failure, for whom a kidney transplant would offer a better quality of life. Historically, many donor kidneys are rejected with little empirical evidence because they are perceived to be ‘unsuitable for use’ or from ‘high\-risk’ donors. A similar problem exists for livers, with a third of deceased donor livers being unused, while patients are dying through lack of a transplant. A systematic programme of research led by the University of Cambridge has provided data demonstrating the quality and safety of organs that would previously have been rejected by many centres. They have pioneered techniques to allow rejected organs to be kept viable for assessment and successful transplantation. Their research has contributed to a 25% increase in the number of kidney transplants in the UK between 2013/14 and 2019/20, optimised usage of donor kidneys via a UK fast track scheme, informed national and international guidance on the allocation and safety of organs for transplantation, improved informed consent practice for transplant recipients across the UK and spearheaded new technology to improve availability of donor organs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The NIHR\-funded Access to Transplant and Transplant Outcome Measures \(ATTOM\) Study, of which Cambridge researchers were lead members, studied 6,844 kidney transplant and dialysis patients between 2011 and 2016. ATTOM confirmed that kidney transplants provide far greater quality of life and healthcare savings than long\-term dialysis treatment, and highlighted dramatic variations in kidney transplant rates across UK, owing to a lack of standard practice for selecting donor organs and recipients \[1\]. Concern about the use of kidneys from donation after circulatory death \(DCD\) patients – donors from whom life\-support was withdrawn – further limited available organs for transplantation. Cambridge University\-led research has focused on assessing the quality and safety of kidneys deemed ‘unsuitable or high\-risk’ for transplantation, providing an evidence\-base for increasing the number of safe organs available for transplant. 

 **Demonstrating the suitability of DCD kidney transplants:** Cambridge University\-led research has been pivotal in demonstrating the equivalent value of DCD relative to the more common brain\-death donor \(DBD\) kidney transplants. Their study of 8,289 first\-time kidney transplant recipients in all 23 UK centres between 2000 \- 2007 identified equal 5\-year graft survival rates between recipients of DCD \(n=793\) and DBD transplants \(6,759; hazard ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19, p=0.97\) \[2\]. Importantly, they also showed DCD donor kidneys tolerate cold storage less well than DBD donor kidneys, highlighting this as a critical consideration for organ allocation policy \[3\]. To provide histological evidence that DCD and DBD kidneys are equivalent, Pettigrew led an assessment of 243 DCD and 128 DBD ‘time zero’ kidney biopsies; demonstrating that the severity of chronic kidney injury and transplant outcome is equivalent for DCD and DBD kidneys and that the absolute injury score rather than donor source was predictive of graft outcome \[4\]. 

 **Demonstrating the safety of organs from ‘increased\-risk’ donors:** The reluctance of centres to transplant organs from donors considered to be high\-risk for transmitting disease to recipients, has also significantly reduced the availability of organs for transplantation. Historically, these practices have been established with little empirical evidence. In a study of 17,262 potential donors in the UK \(2003 to 2015\), Cambridge researchers showed that no significant difference was observed in graft outcome among recipients receiving organs from increased risk behaviour \(IRB\) and non\-IRB donors \[5\]. Cambridge also co\-led a large national study that confirmed no cancer transmission to recipients receiving 133 organ transplants from donors with a previous malignant disease \[6\]. These studies have transformed understanding of organ suitability, confirming the that the risk\-benefit ratio favours transplantation of organs from donors previously viewed as ‘high\-risk’ compared to declining organs and continuing with the risk of death on the waiting list. 

 **Improving the quality of transplanted kidneys and livers** 

 **Ex vivo normothermic perfusion \(EVNP\):** Approximately 15% of kidneys are declined for transplantation each year because of concerns of poor quality, e.g. inadequate perfusion. Cambridge researchers have pioneered EVNP of kidneys to restore function *ex vivo* \(after organ recovery\), to enable assessment of viability and to provide an opportunity to “recondition” kidneys, as well as being an alternative means of preservation. To provide proof\-of\-principle, kidneys from a 35\-year\-old DCD donor that had been declined by all UK transplant centres were subjected to one\-hour EVNP after which standard criteria confirmed they were suitable for transplantation. Transplantation was completed into two recipients without complication, both of whom benefited from long term graft health \[7\]. This was expanded to a subsequent study in which of eight kidneys declined because of poor cold perfusion in the donor, five were successfully transplanted after EVNP, with four having immediate function \[8\]. 22% of DBD livers are also declined. Cambridge researchers have pioneered EVNP assessment of marginal livers, developed viability criteria, and demonstrated the ability to transplant livers declined by all centres \[9\]. 

 **In situ normothermic regional perfusion**: Only 27% of DCD livers are used, because they have a higher chance of not working \(4% vs 0.8% for DBD\), and of being lost early through bile duct problems. Cambridge researchers pioneered a programme of *in situ* \(i.e. prior to organ recovery\) normothermic regional perfusion \(NRP\) in DCD donors before the liver is removed, enabling its assessment but also minimising ischaemic damage \[10\]. This technology also improves outcomes for kidneys and increases utilisation of pancreases.

1.  **Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 There are currently \(2020\) around 6,000 people on the UK Transplant Waiting List. Of those, approximately 600 are awaiting a liver transplant, and approximately 4,600 awaiting a kidney transplant. Cambridge University, through its transplant personnel, continues to be at the forefront of national transplantation research and has an international reputation for excellence \[A\]. Research has led to the following impacts: 

 <ins> **Impact on the health and wellbeing of people**</ins> 

 **Increasing access to kidney transplantation nationally:** Watson, Chair of the National Health Service Blood and Transplant \(NHSBT\) Kidney Advisory Group, led a team to design an updated policy for kidney allocation \[A\]. From September 2019 a new national kidney offering scheme was introduced in the UK, which addresses some of the inequities resulting from the previous 2006 kidney allocation scheme. Recognising Cambridge University research showing the good long\-term outcomes of DCD kidneys \[2\], this scheme now allows for offering of DCD kidneys as well as DBD kidneys. 

 **Development of the UK Kidney Fast\-Track scheme \(KFTS\):** Having identified that usable kidneys were being declined by transplant centres, in 2012 Cambridge led the development of a national fast\-track offering scheme to rapidly place rejected kidneys in centres willing to transplant them. Declined deceased donor kidneys meeting defined entry criteria for the KFTS are simultaneously offered to all participating transplant centres. Kidneys are allocated through existing algorithms, but with the added flexibility that the accepting centre can implant the kidneys into the recipients of their choosing. An initial outcomes study published in 2017 reported that 286 DBD kidneys \(Nov 2012\-Apr 2015\) and 237 DCD kidneys were transplanted \(Mar 2013\-Apr 2015\), with results as good as non\-fast track kidneys \(1 year graft survival >90%\) \[B\]. As of November 2020, the scheme continues to run UK\-wide. 

 **Increased number of patients receiving organ transplants:** By demonstrating the quality and suitability of kidneys donated after DCD, Cambridge University research has contributed to the 25% \(n=191\) increase in number of patients receiving a DCD renal transplant between 2013/2014 and 2018/2019, with 6053 patients receiving kidneys from DCD donors since 2013, and 970 in 2018/2019 alone. From the Medical Director of NHSBT *“Research at the University of Cambridge…has contributed to an increasing acceptance in UK transplant centres of DCD kidneys, observable in an overall upwards trend of DCD kidney transplants since 2014”* \[A\]. 

 **Decreased waiting times for transplantation:** Cambridge University research demonstrating safety and quality of organs has resulted in Cambridge patients waiting less time for a kidney transplant \(2014\-17 median waiting time 360 days vs UK median 603 days \[A\]\). This has particularly benefitted elderly patients listed for a kidney transplant, who generally wait longer for transplantation: 60% of Cambridge patients listed when 65 years or older received a transplant by five years, compared with only 38% of the equivalent patient group nationally.  Elsewhere a higher proportion either died or were delisted before receiving a transplant \[C\]. 

 **Patient education and empowerment:** Cambridge University research has engaged potential kidney transplant recipients in more informed discussions around the transplantation of kidneys from high\-risk donors by quantifying the risks. In recognition of the need to discuss risk with patients, Cambridge co\-led, with the Directorate for Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation NHS Blood and Transplant and key stakeholders, the development in 2015 of the first UK guidelines for consent for transplantation \[D\]. Consequently, common practices are now shared across UK NHS trusts, meaning that patients should be equally well informed when making decisions and receive parity of care wherever they are treated. 

 <ins> **Impact on commerce and the economy**</ins> 

 **Healthcare savings by increasing the number of transplants:** ATTOM confirmed that kidney transplantation is cheaper than dialysis, saving GBP15,000 per transplant in the first 6 years \[E\]. Cambridge University research has contributed to an additional 191 DCD kidney transplants in the UK between 2013/14 and 2018/19. A conservative estimate of healthcare savings to the NHS arising from these additional transplants is therefore at least GBP2,850,000. This is likely to continue to increase given the upward trajectory of use of DCD donor organs and other previously declined organs for transplantation. 

 **Healthcare savings by increasing the success of transplants:** The utilisation of biopsy information and functional assessment of kidneys by normothermic perfusion, together with the identification of the shorter tolerance of DCD kidneys to cold storage, all reduce the chance of unsuccessful transplants which are associated with prolonged inpatient stay and increased resource utilisation. The use of *in situ* normothermic perfusion and EVNP of livers has had a similar impact on liver transplantation locally, and this is likely to be translated nationally. 

 <ins> **Impact on practitioners and the delivery of professional services**</ins> 

 **Improving international practice in organ selection and quality:** Research into the risks of transmission of donor diseases has been incorporated into national and international guidance: 

-  Cambridge University researchers have co\-authored guidance from the UK Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs \(SaBTO\). From the Chair of SaBTO: *“By removing uncertainty, and providing some estimation of risk, this body of work has made a major contribution not only to an increased acceptance and uptake of organs for transplantation but also provides both patients and health care professionals the best available evidence on which to make decisions about the use of scarce, life\-saving organs.”* \[F\]. 

-  Professor Watson formed part of the working group that developed the 7<sup>th</sup> Edition of the *Guide to the quality and safety of organs for transplantation* by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare of the Council of Europe \(EDQM\). In October 2020 the Council of Europe issued a recommendation that the governments of member States ensure that quality and safety standards for organ donation and transplantation are set in place in accordance with these guidelines. The guidelines are used not only by the UK and member states of Europe but have been accessed over 1000 times by non\-EU countries \[F\]. 

 <ins> **P</ins><ins>ioneering</ins> <ins>technology to improve uptake of organs</ins><ins>:**</ins> 

 Cambridge University researchers have pioneered the introduction of normothermic organ perfusion into clinical practice. In January 2019, NICE issued guidance \(from evidence which cited \[10\]\) recommending *ex situ* machine perfusion \(EVNP\) for extracorporeal preservation of livers for transplantation, under special arrangements as more data is gathered into its efficacy \[G\]. EVNP technology is now used clinically in at least three kidney transplant centres in the UK and the Cambridge perfusion protocol has been adapted for clinical use in The Netherlands and the USA \[H\]. Early work has shown a more rapid resumption of kidney function in DCD kidneys than those not undergoing normothermic perfusion, reducing the need for post\-operative dialysis and reducing inpatient stay \[I\]. 

 The UK National Protocol for direct procurement of cardiothoracic organs and in situ normothermic regional perfusion \(NRP\) of the abdominal organs, co\-written by Professor Watson, was published in May 2019 \[J\]. Cambridge research on *in situ* NRP was used by NHSBT to apply for funding to commission a national service for NRP in all DCD donors. In 2020 Professor Watson was invited by NHSBT to lead a committee implementing roll out of NRP in the UK \[A\]. Funding for the service has been granted in Scotland and Wales in 2019/20. Calculations on the cost benefit of this technology to the NHS show a substantial economic benefit: GBP2,380,000 cost of 100 retrievals using NRP vs GBP3,550,000 for 100 retrievals without NRP \[A\]. These cost savings are due to lower rates of post\-transplant complications and higher rates of graft survival. In Cambridge alone between 2013 and 2020 the use of *in situ* NRP has led to the transplantation of 78 livers of which two\-thirds would have otherwise been discarded, while maintaining high survival rates \(April 2015 \- March 2019 risk\-adjusted 1 year survival rates for Cambridge liver transplants was 96.8% \(CI 94.4 \- 98.2\)\) \[A\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Impact was realised through *Queering Paradigms* \(QP\), an inclusive multi\-disciplinary network, conference and book series developed as the vehicle for Scherer’s ‘Applied Queer Studies’ approach. This approach aims to effect change by connecting queer insights to legal, political and social injustices. In 2016, QP’s 7th conference \(QP7\) was held in the Cayman Islands, a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean, which does not afford same sex couples with the same legal protection as non\-LGBT\+ residents, including the right to marry. It has: 

 Influenced public debate and raised wider awareness and understanding of LGBT\+ rights within the Cayman Islands; 

 Catalysed debate on LGBT\+ rights within the Christian community in the region and beyond; 

 Influenced political debate and played a role in the movement towards legal change in relation to recognition of same\-sex marriage in the Islands. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Impact is underpinned by Scherer’s examination of the relationship between queer and religion, and the potential this presents for inclusivity and furthering LGBT\+ rights within religious contexts, and the development of a distinct activism centred approach to Queer Theory. The research trajectory began in 2006 with an examination of gender identity and transformation in Early Buddhist narratives, analysing their potential to support positive attitudes to LGBT\+ inclusivity in contemporary Buddhism **\[3.1\].** This led to an examination of ‘Buddhist Theology’ and homo\- and transphobic attitudes in a contemporary neo\-orthodox Buddhist movement, which analysed intersections between religion, sexuality and gender and the communalities between Tantric Buddhist philosophy and Queer Theory. Here, Queer Theory with its focus on gender, sexual ethics and sexualities, added insight into the ‘tradition versus modernity’ debate in a Tibetan Buddhist movement **\[3.2\].** *QueerThinking Religion: Queering Religious* *Paradigms* extends this exploration of the dialogue between queer and religion and proffers a way to develop a more beneficial relationship between the two; proposing ‘queer\-thought religion as embodied compassion\-in\-action’ **\[3.3\].** 

  

 Drawing on this potential of academic scholarship to further LGBT\+ rights in religious contexts, Scherer realised the necessity for ‘performative scholarship as activism’ that engages with non\-academic activists and stakeholders. This work is a commitment to social justice and human rights advocacy and bridges the gap between elitist and highly specialist academic discourse and the concerns of local activists globally. An ‘Applied Queer Studies’ approach aims to challenge the conventions of religious studies as academic discipline and its undisclosed biases, arguing that there is no ‘mere criticality’ but that societal responsibility needs to be part of scholarly engagement **\[3.4\]**. Realised through the *Queering Paradigms* \(QP\) project, a network, conference and peer\-reviewed book series, established in 2008, scholarly insights from Religious Studies, Theology, Gender Studies, Sociology and Queer Studies are applied to specific legal, political and social injustice. It represents a practical application of academic insights to further inclusivity and make tangible change. Conferences have been held in the UK, Australia, USA, Brazil, Ecuador, Cayman Islands and Austria, each providing the thematic focus for an associated peer\-reviewed edited collection *Queering Paradigms*. Scherer is overall series editor and has co\-edited 4 volumes \(I, II, VI & VII\), with their applied activism\-centred approach to Queer Studies outlined in the introductions of volume I and II and expanded on in a chapter in volume V **\[3.4\]**. Scherer contributed chapters to volumes III, VI and VII:  *Queer as Kagyu: negotiating dissident identities* \(2013\) is an examination of ‘queer emancipation’ **\[3.5\]**; *Variant Dharma: Buddhist queers, queering* *Buddhisms* explores how ‘Buddhist queers’ are traditionally constructed by Buddhist views on non\-normative sexualities and gender identities, framed in traditional Buddhist ethics and teachings on sexualities and gender variance, allowing opportunities for a queer Buddhist ‘liberation theology’ **\[3.6\].** Raznovich contributed a chapter to QPI, *Recognition of Overseas Same Sex Marriages: A Matter of Equality and Sound Statutory Interpretation* \(2010\). This examined the legal and ethical implications associated with same sex married couples being denied the legal protection provided by marriage, with a particular focus on jurisdictions where such unions were not currently permitted **\[3.7\].**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Despite being a British Overseas Territory, same sex couples in the Cayman Islands \(approximately 65,000 residents\) do not have the same legal rights as non\-LGBT\+ residents, including marriage only being recognised between a man and a woman. The Cayman Human Rights Commission in written evidence to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Inquiry on the future of the UK Overseas Territories \(2019\), outlined a culture of ‘homophobic attitudes within sections of the legislature in the Cayman Islands and vocal sections of the community \(particularly some of the churches\)’ which ‘has a potent and pernicious impact’. The Commission continued to detail a debate which took place in the Cayman Island’s Legislative Assembly in 2015, where statements were made that equated homosexuality with bestiality and paedophilia, claimed that homosexuality was ‘deviant behaviour’, ‘wicked and immoral’ and a ‘social and moral evil’, and personal threats of violence were made towards homosexuals. Against this background, in 2016 the 7<sup>th</sup> *Queering Paradigms* conference \(QP7\) was held in the Cayman Islands, following local Caymanian activists approaching Scherer. The academic programme for QP7 explored queerness in the Caribbean socio\-legal context, and featured high profile speakers including: Jamaican LGBT activist Maurice Tomlinson; Professor Eugenio Raúl Zaffaroni, Justice of the Inter American Court of Human Rights; and The Rt Rvd Dr. Alan Wilson \(Bishop of Buckingham\), who addressed the vocal Christian opposition to LGBT\+ rights in the Caribbean. Raznovich, who had maintained close links with QP as a Senior Visiting Research Fellow, spoke on his own legal challenge to gain residency in the Cayman Islands based on his same sex marital status. QP7 shaped public, religious and political debate, contributed to a wider public understanding and awareness of LGBT\+ rights in the Caymans, and formed part of the wider movement towards legal change in the islands. 

 **Influencing public debate and raising awareness and understanding of LGBT\+ rights in the Cayman Islands.** The significance of the issues addressed by QP7 is given by widespread media coverage of the conference within the Caymans. Prior to the conference, The Cayman Compass and The Cayman Reporter \(31 March 2016\) reported on QP7’s ambition to draw attention to human rights and sexuality in the region, and the Cayman News Service detailed Rt Rvd. Dr Alan Wilson’s forthcoming contribution to the conference \(4 April 2016\). Cayman 27 \(Cayman’s only local TV news channel\), reported on opposition to the conference from within the Cayman Island’s Legislative Assembly \(18 April 2016\), and covered the fundraising dinner for QP7 \(29 April 2016\). In the week before QP7, local media attention intensified with coverage on Radio Cayman One; Cayman 27; Cayman Compass; and Cayman News Service \(all 6 June 2016\). The following day, QP7 was included in a report on Cayman 27 about same sex marriage, alongside comments from Raznovich, and The Cayman Compass published two articles reporting on the opposition faced by the conference. There were nearly 40 media items linked to QP7 in 2016, with the conference featuring on news channel Cayman 27 seven times between 6\-16 June. The volume of comments online articles attracted was notable. The Cayman News Service averaged over 100 comments per article, articulating the polarised nature of debate on LGBT\+ rights in the Caymans. **\[5.1\]** 

 The conference organisers were clear that all were welcome to attend, an opportunity taken by resident Velma Herod. Cayman 27 reported how ‘One self\-described Christian Caymanian told Cayman 27 she looked to her faith for the answer. “For years I’ve been hearing that this island is a God\-fearing place, so why, what is the hatred, why do you hate these people, why? You cannot hate,” said Velma Herod. She told Cayman 27 that discrimination against the LGBT community, and hatred of any sort, is out of step with the words of her savior. \[…\] Before her attendance \[…\] Ms. Herod said she never met an LGBT\+ person. \[…\] Ms. Herod said she comes away from queering paradigms with a better understanding of why same sex marriage is such an important human rights issue.’ **\[5.1\]** 

 **Contributing to debate within the Christian community in the region and beyond**. The conference attracted opposition from sections of the Christian community in the Cayman Islands. On 18 May 2016, an open letter was sent on behalf of the Cayman Ministers’ Association and the Cayman Islands Conference of the Seventh Day Adventists to HM Governor of the Cayman Islands. They stated they were ‘deeply concerned that your office has publicly been associated with the planned June 11–12, 2016 “Queering Paradigms” conference sponsored by Canterbury Christ Church University, UK \[…\] We are concerned that \[…\] \[it\] appears clearly to have been promoted with the objective of undermining the traditional Judeo\-Christian values of the vast majority of Caymanian residents \[…\] Our feeling, however, is that there is an inherent conflict of interest involved when the holder of the Office of Governor appears to be supportive of a socio\-ethical position that will be as divisive as those that have already polarised our legislature’. Mr V. Arden Mclean MLA \(Member of the Legislative Assembly\), reported on the letter in the Legislative Assembly \(LA\) on the 6 June 2016 **\[5.2\]**. 

 Following from this, an open letter \(7 June 2016\) published in the Cayman Compass from the Pastors of the Cayman Ministers Association expressed ‘grave concern’ over the conference ‘by an entity called “Queering Paradigms” under the sponsorship of Canterbury Christ Church University in the UK’. They concluded that ‘we call on the people of the Cayman Islands to stand strong in your defence of our biblical Christian position on morality and family – but to do more than stand. Express your concern to those in authority, making it clear that you also consider this recent development to be an affront to your values and the social health of our islands \[…\] there is a war being waged against our biblical, Christian values relating to marriage and family life.’ **\[5.3\]** Coverage of QP7 also extended discussion of LGBT\+ rights in the region to the wider Christian community. An article from the Cayman News Service was reposted by Anglican Mainstream on 5 April 2016, which published a further article about QP7 on 8 June 2016. The conference and the contribution being made by the Bishop of Buckingham was the subject of articles and comment on US outlets such as Episcopal Café \(8 June 2016\) and Juicy Ecumenism \(27 June 2016\), and featured on Religious Dispatches \(13 June 2016\), and Virtue Online \(21 June 2016\), who also reposted the Juicy Ecumenism article **\[5.1\].** 

 **Influence on political debate and contribution to a move towards legal change**. QP7 was a catalyst for further debate in the Cayman Island’s Legislative Assembly \(LA\), documented in the Island’s Official Hansard Report and the media. Cayman 27 reported that Anthony S. Eden, a Member of the Legislative Assembly \(MLA\), had claimed in relation to QP7 that ‘Cayman’s way of life is at risk’ and ‘urged community members to stand up for the country’s traditional values.’ \(18 April 2016\) **\[5.1\]** On 2 June 2016 in the LA, Eden referred to the conference and his meeting \(alongside 8 of his colleagues\) with the Executive of the Pastors of the Cayman Ministers’ Association and with Pastors of the Seventh Day Adventists Faith ‘to express our concerns of foreign elements seeming to want us to change our marriage law and Constitution to allow same sex marriage or unions \(or whatever they want to call it\).’ **\[5.4\]** On 3 June 2016, Opposition Leader W. McKeeva Bush referenced QP7 whilst speaking in the LA criticising what he saw as the position of the Governor of the Cayman Islands, ‘I ponder why it is the Governor is taking her precious time to give credence and stir up more controversy of opening now the LGBT conference. The churches in this country are now going to have to stand in the gap \[…\] I do hope that Her Majesty’s representative in this country will think a little bit about the desires of the vast majority of the people of these Islands.’ Bush concluded by raising the issue of a referendum on same sex unions. **\[5.5\]** Premier Alden McLaughlin responded to these comments by ruling out a referendum and noting, ‘we have a Bill of Rights that is part of our Constitution, which expressly prohibits discrimination on a range of issues, including, as the case law has interpreted the section, sexual orientation. And we are also bound by the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights which is in similar terms’. **\[5.6\]** Further evidence of debate related to QP7 is given by the conference featuring in the Cayman Human Right’s Commission Annual Report \(2016\) which stated that it ‘highlighted the stigma and discrimination that the LGBT\+ community are faced with on a regular basis.’ **\[5.7\]** 

 QP7 formed part of the wider movement towards legal change in the Cayman Islands. Conference attendee Gerardo Ochoa\-Vargas described it as a ‘watershed event’ for the island **\[5.8\]**; one of the local organisers of QP7, Olivia Connelly, commented that it was a ‘way to continue to build on the momentum’ that had been developing in the Cayman Islands for LGBT\+ rights **\[5.1\]**, and Raznovich described QP7 as ‘a milestone for change in the Cayman Islands’ **\[5.8\]**. Following QP7, in July 2016, Raznovich won his legal battle to be granted residency in the Caymans based on his same sex marital status and continued campaigning for further legal change. In March 2019 following a lawsuit filed by a Caymanian\-British same sex couple, the Cayman’s Grand Court granted the couple the right to marry. The Court of Appeal later reversed the decision but specified that the territory should offer unions which had a ‘legal status equivalent to marriage.’ The resulting Domestic Partnership Bill was narrowly defeated in the Legislative Assembly in July 2020. In August 2020 the UK Government made a rare intervention into Cayman Islands politics, as they were left ‘with no option but to act to uphold the law.’ Renamed the Civil Partnership Bill, the bill was assented into law in September 2020, enabling same sex couple to enter into a legally recognised union in the Cayman Islands. This, alongside 11 additional pieces of legislation, also provided access to other rights enjoyed by married couples in the Caymans, previously unavailable to the LGBT\+ community. **\[5.8\]**

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 History of Design research at the University of Brighton \(UoB\) has transformed understanding of design as an important socio\-material practice. The research raised the profile of design and material culture for publics and professionals as a means of understanding and representing history and society. By uncovering previously overlooked and under\-researched subjects and by re\-defining design concepts and frameworks this research has united diverse audiences and stakeholders, inspired new creative practice and built capacity for design to address live policy issues. The research has contributed to the growth of new and diverse audiences and also led to the expansion of the Policy Lab at the UK Government’s Cabinet Office from 1.4 to 18FTE with an annual turnover of more than GBP1,000,000. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Building on its international position as a nucleus for the subject, History of Design research at UoB has pioneered new methods of analysis and practices of interpretation. This has led to transformed understandings of how design is valued, represented and consumed through research, which is undertaken in partnership with a range of stakeholders from within the cultural industries and, in particular, museums, galleries and policymakers. The research that underpins this case study develops strategically from an impact case study submitted to REF 2014. At UoB the period from 2014 saw accelerated engagement with design history research that underpinned the establishment of the UoB Centre for Design History in 2017. 

 Design history research at UoB continues to provide a framework for addressing contemporary questions of society, identity and culture through historical analysis of the formation of design, and through pioneering new methods to engage specific user groups and stakeholders with innovative approaches to social design. Research stretches across disciplinary boundaries to re\-define traditional narratives of design, with particular emphasis on interrogating design’s international and transnational networks. At the interface of object\-based studies, museum curatorship and design history, Professor Jeremy Aynsley and Dr Annebella Pollen’s research into previously under\-represented figures and movements has revealed the significance of historical examples of design practice for contemporary academic, social and political debates about its significance as a form of cultural production. Building on Professor Guy Julier’s longstanding expertise in the history of design and design cultures, Julier and Dr Lucy Kimbell’s research into social design extended the application of design tools to new contexts to understand and reframe contemporary challenges for positive societal benefit. 

##  2.1 Creating new insights into identity and cultural history 

 Drawing on overlooked material across a range of collections and sources, research by Aynsley and Pollen has led to publications and exhibitions \(Wolfsonian Florida International University and Whitechapel Gallery\). Extending his earlier enquiry into histories of graphic design, Aynsley’s research on Julius Klinger \(1876\-1942\), a leading figure within Austrian poster design and graphic art, investigated how individual, group, urban, commercial, religious and national identities can be shaped and defined through graphic design \[Reference 3.1\]. Locating her research at the interface of dress history and social history, Pollen’s work on the British Woodcraft Movement, with a particular focus on the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift \(1920 – 1951\), extends the enquiry through an exploration of art, craft, design and dress as contributing to identities through radical strategies of resistance and reform \[3.2\]. 

##  2.2 Identifying links between design history, contemporary culture and social issues 

 Drawing on the holdings of the Wolfsonian FIU, one of the most significant collections of Klinger’s work in the USA, and with reference to materials at the Kunstbibliothek, Berlin and Museum für Angewandte Kunst, Vienna, Aynsley’s research placed Klinger’s body of work within its Viennese context. The research cast new light on the overlooked historical importance of the Jewish contribution to Modernism in design and Klinger’s perceptions of the impact of American modernity on Europe through his response as a designer \[3.1\]. Pollen’s exploration of the historical aesthetics of creative oppositional cultures, mystical beliefs and alternative spiritualities, located and analysed largely un\-exhibited and unpublished substantial public and private collections of Kibbo Kift artefacts, uncovering a largely forgotten aspect of British art, design and social and cultural history. Through detailed historical analysis of designed artefacts and a focus on symbolism in dress and design, Pollen’s research offered new insights and interpretations that connect the Kibbo Kift and their practices with contemporary popular public discourse on youth culture, design activism and radical resistance \[3.2\] 

##  2.3 Applying social design as a tool for collaboration 

 Informed by an equivalent understanding of design as a productive social force, while seeking proactively to apply this within a contemporary context, research undertaken by Julier and Kimbell in 2014 and 2015 was instrumental in identifying and defining ‘social design’ as an emerging field of enquiry and practice capable of mobilising design processes for societal benefit through new forms of cross\-disciplinary and multiple stakeholder collaboration \[3.3\]. Two AHRC\-commissioned projects *Mapping Social Design* \(2014\) and *Developing Participation in Social Design: Prototyping Projects, Programmes and Policies* \(2015\) first sought to understand and map social design research and then to test co\-produced design\-oriented research towards collective and social ends. A parallel AHRC\-funded fellowship for Kimbell that built on the related research \[3.3\] and was hosted by the Cabinet Office in the UK Policy Lab, provided an opportunity to extend the understanding of design beyond the realm of specialised professionals. Through her participant observation in the team, Kimbell translated insights from research into emerging design innovation practices in the Civil Service and, as a researcher, critically assessed this development \[3.4\]. Julier later argued for a concept of ‘design citizenship’ in the public sector, to provide a channel for governments to connect with people and the material culture within which people recognise themselves as citizens \[3.5\]. This built on the work developed through the Design Salons series at the V&A Museum, bringing together design industry practitioners and academics, as part of Julier’s V&A fellowship. Together, these helped to advance research into the complex, dynamic and pervasive role of design in contemporary society \[3.6\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 This programme of research and the resulting exhibitions and publications have transformed understandings of design in contemporary society and led to increased recognition of and capacity for design in the programmes of cultural, research and policy organisations. The research of Aynsley and Pollen presented previously under\-represented cultural figures and groups in public art venues, affecting public audiences, museum professionals and creative practitioners by providing new insights into the tangible connections between historical and contemporary individual and collective cultural identities. Complementing this historical focus, Julier and Kimbell’s work on social design pushed the boundaries of design practice to reshape understanding of design as a socially impactful process. 

##  4.1 Reshaping gallery strategy and curatorial practice 

 As the guest curator of the exhibition at the Wolfsonian FIU, Aynsley introduced the designer Julius Klinger, whose work had not previously been the subject of a solo exhibition in the USA, to a new public in Miami, Florida \[Source 5.1\]. For the Wolfsonian, the Klinger exhibition was both a testbed for hosting a graphic arts exhibition and for a show with a monographic focus on a little\-known designer. This greatly increased the organisation’s understanding of its own collection. The success of the Klinger show led the Wolfsonian to review its curatorial practice, intensifying its engagement with graphic arts. This led to the development of a number of subsequent Wolfsonian projects including a monographic exhibition of Cuban illustrator and art director Conrado Walter Massaguer; an exhibition on early Soviet propaganda posters; an installation and accompanying virtual exhibition about HIV/AIDS awareness posters; and daylong “Posterfest” events in 2018 and 2019, celebrating posters as a communications medium \[5.1\]. In 2020, the Poster House Museum in New York, which opened in 2019 as the first US museum dedicated to posters, will host the exhibition \(4 March – 15 August 2021\). Aynsley’s research for the exhibition also led to the acquisition of later works by Klinger from his final period in Vienna, which has expanded and strengthened the Wolfsonian’s collection \[5.1\]. 

 Pollen’s research into the arts, crafts, design and fashion of the Kibbo Kift, a forgotten moment from the history of British design, underpinned the exhibition *Intellectual Barbarians: The Kibbo Kift Kindred,* co\-curated by Pollen. The reconstruction of this history brought the context and cultural life of this group into the present, described by Jon Savage, a leading cultural critic and author of some of the most influential works on youth culture, as ‘ *a revelation*’ which ‘ *reconstructs a radical moment lost to history*’ \[5.2\]. Hosted by the Whitechapel Gallery – the site of a major Kibbo Kift exhibition in 1929 – the exhibition provided new knowledge that led the gallery to develop a deeper understanding of its own history. The exhibition attracted 225,000 visitors in its five\-month run \(2015 – 2016\) \[5.3\]. The particular history encountered in this exhibition brought to the gallery a range of groups including schoolchildren, academics and those interested in design, ecology and politics. Notably many individual visitors were distinct from the usual art world followers. The materials received renewed interest upon the close of the exhibition, with requests for research and loans coming from Tate Liverpool to inform the research and development of their own planned exhibition \[5.3\]. 

##  4.2 Deepening public engagement with historic and contemporary culture through design 

 In its six\-month showing, the Klinger exhibition, which offered unique insights into his life and work and the displacement he experienced, supported the Wolfsonian to meet its aim to connect its collections with contemporary societal issues. The show raised awareness of the contribution of Jewish designers to European modernist design, with visitors articulating both a sense of loss and valuing the role of the exhibition in honouring the contribution of talented designers \[5.1, 5.4, 5.5\]. Through arranging special programs including a tour and reception for Miami’s American Institute of Graphic Arts chapter and the April 21 Posterfest event, co\-organised by the Wolfsonian with AIGA and Adobe, the exhibition enabled the Wolfsonian to fulfil its outreach goal to engage creative professionals as a target audience \[5.1, 5.5\]. 

 Pollen’s detailed presentation of the peculiarities of the Kibbo Kift with bold images of the design and artefacts attracted diverse audiences with reviews published in specialist craft, fashion, costume, popular culture and design blogs and journals, as well as mainstream press coverage \( *The Guardian* and the *Financial Times*\) \[5.2\]. In October 2015, BBC Radio 3’s *Free Thinking* broadcast with Michael Rosen, explored Pollen’s narrative on Kibbo Kift youth culture, costume and art alongside a nuanced reading of Rosen’s latest anthology that explores the same period through the lives and experiences of his parents and grandparents. This broadcast shows how, through the research and exhibition, public perceptions of the Kibbo Kift have moved from the idea of an isolated group to one connected to history, society and modern culture \[5.6\]. Pollen’s book and Whitechapel exhibition led to new forms of artistic expression in the fashion industry. Sadie Williams, a London\-born Young British Designer whose fashion collections juxtapose modernity with applied craftsmanship, cites Pollen’s work as the main source of inspiration for her Spring/Summer 2018 collection \[5.7, 5.8\]. Williams, who in 2016 was named in *Forbes Magazine’s* “30 Under 30” list for the Arts, brought the Kibbo Kift\-inspired collection to London Fashion Week in 2017. The research informed decisions around the creation of the set design and accompanying visual assets, such as the Spring/Summer campaign imagery and campaign film \[5.8\]. The opening of this show garnered attention from an influential guest list including: the BBC, *Cosmopolitan* UK, *Harper’s Bazaar*, Harvey Nichols, Swarovski and *Vogue*. The collection, campaign material and press coverage reached a global audience with pieces from the collection being featured in editorial photoshoots for several international publications, such as *Russh Magazine*, *Elle*, *Huffington Post* and *SLEEK Magazine*. The combined total audience for this collection, inspired by Pollen’s research, was over 150,000,000 and sales of the collection have been made to companies in London, Hong Kong and Japan \[5.8\]. 

##  4.3 Mobilising social design as a tool for contemporary cultural change 

 Julier and Kimbell’s early research into social design, published in the reports *Mapping Social Design* \(2014\) and *Applying Design Approaches to Policy Making* \(2015\) contributed insights and recommendations that informed the groundwork for future social design research at a national level. The first of these reports, commissioned by the AHRC, was published to help guide future plans for supporting design research, one of the AHRC's priority areas \[5.9\]. The report focused on design for social innovation, socially responsive design, and design activism and raised challenges for the field at a critical point in its history. The former Associate Director of Programmes at the AHRC confirmed that these reports informed the Council’s approach to its design research strategic funding \[5.10\]. The research made recommendations for ways that the AHRC’s approach could help address demand and ‘ *to encourage a more “applied research” approach*’ that helped to ‘ *build capacity in universities and deliver benefits through collaborative projects with businesses and public sector organisations*’ \[5.10\]. This research informed an AHRC funding call in 2014 for Design Research Fellowships. The reports also provided valuable evidence which ‘ *informed discussions with other Research Councils and InnovateUK on the role of design and design research approaches in delivering economic and social impacts for business, industry and public sector organisations as well as in government policy development’* \[5.10\]. In addition, Julier’s work with the AHRC on developing approaches to social design helped to establish it as a strand of thinking at the V&A. This was supported by the Design Culture Salon Series, curated by Julier at the V&A since 2012, that established a forum for high scholarly debate in the field of contemporary design \[5.11\]. 

 The parallel AHRC\-funded Policy Lab fellowship supported the organisational and individual learning of the Cabinet Office, building the capacity of civil servants to use design methods that explore and frame problems and generate and iterate solutions, bringing a more diverse group of stakeholders into the policy\-making process. The Policy Lab pilot was established as part of the Civil Service reform plan under the Open Policy Making agenda; it provided a home to build design capacity through demonstrator projects. The fellowship built on Kimbell’s research on the landscape of social design and design thinking for managers. Kimbell designed and delivered workshops and projects, which led to the development of new frameworks that helped to recognise the contribution of the Policy Lab to the policy\-making process and its relevance to live policy issues. This connected the pilot to a wider field and the research findings within the report, alongside an internally commissioned evaluation, contributed to the extension of the Policy Lab into a further year of funding. Following this success, the Cabinet Office funded the expansion of the Policy Lab and it now employs 18 staff \(grown from 1.4 in its first year\) with an annual turnover of more than GBP1,000,000 \[5.12\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 UWS researchers have reshaped governance and parliamentary capacities at multiple levels, across devolved, UK and European policy domains. Governance reform research has influenced processes relating to the European cohesion mechanisms, parliamentary reform, policing reform as well as fisheries, health and education policy reforms. This body of research has changed how international and national policy\-makers and public managers sustain reform across policy sectors, as well as impacting on the structural and organisational aspects of how policies can be better delivered.

 **2 .Underpinning Research** 

 The main policy impacts have been seen across the following areas: 

 **European cohesion policy reform** 

 **Van der Zwet’s** research study for the European Commission **\[3.6, 3.E, 5.7\]** has shaped urban development policy at local, regional, national and European level. The pioneering research was the first study that has collected on integrated sustainable urban development strategies as part of the European Regional Development Fund regulations \(article 7\) in over 500 urban areas across all 28 member states **\[3.E\].** The research: 

-  Provided data for an innovative, interactive online tool developed by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre to support capacity building and lesson learning at the local level **\[5.7\].** 

-  Provided a knowledge base for regulatory discussions for the post\-2020 period, with its recommendations implemented by the European Commission in the 2021 regulatory proposals. 

-  Found that national level urban development policies provide an important framework for implementation of European funds and, as such, directly shaped the design of urban development policy at the national level **\[3.4, 5.8\].** 

 **Fisheries policy reform** 

 Governance capacities resulting from Brexit has been a significant theme and UWS has made major impacts on demonstrating how post\-Brexit Britain can manage fisheries policy based on examining the experiences of non\-EU coastal states. The research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\) **\[3.D\]**, with the main focus being an innovative analysis of the governance capacities \(political, analytical, communicative, and administrative\) which need to reform based on the experiences of non\-EU coastal states **\[3.2, 3.D\].** The research: 

-  Made a major contribution to the success of the award winning *UK in a Changing Europe* think tank **\[5.1\].** 

-  Led to co\-created policy sessions in the UK devolved settings to understand how fisheries policy capacities are to be understood in a post\-Brexit context. 

-  Provided policy recommendations on the creation of a fisheries common framework between the UK and devolved governments for fisheries governance post\-Brexit. 

 **Parliamentary reform** 

 Governance capacities focusing on institutional working by legislatures across the UK has been a major research theme. **Arnott’s** ground\-breaking research has: 

-  Provided solutions to senior policy makers in the devolved and UK legislatures to address inter\-parliamentary relations since the inception of devolution in 1999, and in the context of Brexit **\[3.1\].** This research reshaped future working of the territorial constitution in the devolved UK **\[5.9, 5.10\].** 

-  Improved the capacity for knowledge sharing and democratic scrutiny through cross\-working between devolved legislatures **\[3.F, 5.9\].** 

-  Informed the future of Parliamentary Fellowship schemes in the UK legislatures which aim, in part, to enable evidence\-based governance **\[5.10\].** 

 **Health and education policy reform** 

 Improving public service planning within health and education sectors through capacity building **\[3.3, 3.A, 3.B, 3.C\].** **Connolly’s** work has demonstrated the value of using outcomes frameworks as a tool for shaping public sector reform **\[3.3, 3.B, 3.C\].** This work has: 

-  Led to a co\-created outcomes framework for NHS Health Scotland utilised by policy\-makers and health practitioners across the globe. As well as having international reach, the outcomes framework was used to redesign mental health service planning across Scotland **\[3.3, 3.B\].** 

-  Led to national level engagement with Healthcare Improvement Scotland \(HIS\), Education Scotland \(ES\) and NHS Education for Scotland into how outcome frameworks can inform programme and corporate planning **\[5.2, 5.3, 3.A, 3.B, 3.C\]** 

 **Policing reform** 

 **Atkinson** examined governance reform by focusing on British Transport Police Scotland **\[3.5\].** This work has: 

-  Enhanced and shaped public and political debate, and provided an evidence\-base for public policy options on policing reform. 

-  Led to the creation of a Scottish Government knowledge exchange forum on railway policing at the request of the Cabinet Secretary for Justice. This event, which was attended by a range of key policy stakeholders, offered a unique opportunity for Atkinson and Murray’s research to assist in the co\-production of future government policy in this area.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **European cohesion policy reform** 

 An online tool has been developed to facilitate learning in relation to integrated, sustainable urban development among national, **regional and urban actors across Europe**, and informed sustainable urban development practices in urban authorities and managing authorities **\[3.E, 5.7\]**. The study also contributed to the development of national urban policy framework in Romania **\[5.8\]**. Van der Zwet’s study for the European Commission on integrated sustainable urban development strategies made a major impact in terms of capacity building across urban authorities, with dissemination of its findings taking place as part of the **European Commission’s Urban Development Network**, a network that is made up of more than 500 cities **\[3.6\]**. The results of the study were presented to the European Commission officials and have formed part of the European Commission regulatory discussions. Its findings have supported measures to increase flexibility in governance arrangements and additional commitments of ring\-fenced funding. Data from the study was used to populate strat\-board, part of an online data tool for strategic lesson learning and contributed to the development of the Joint Research Centre’s Handbook for Sustainable Urban Development **\[5.7\].** This aims to facilitate the design and implementation of sustainable urban development strategies in the future. 

 **Fisheries policy reform** 

 Sustained international engagement led to this research informing parliamentary publications across the UK \( **Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology, 2018; National Assembly for Wales, 2018; House of Commons, 2019**\). McAngus gave evidence to the Westminster Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee in December 2018 on the Draft Fisheries Bill and later in the year gave evidence to the External Affairs and Additional Legislation Committee of the Welsh Assembly. UWS also features in House of Lords inquiries \- for example Huggins gave evidence to the House of Lords European Union Committee on 4<sup>th</sup> March 2020 in relation to access to UK fisheries post\-Brexit. The ESRC study on the governance capacities of Brexit and fisheries has impacted, largely via the *UK in a Changing Europe* think tank, their work to inform society about the impact of Brexit on fisheries **\[3.2\].** Considerable national and international media attention with a combined circulation of hundreds of millions across Europe and beyond \(such as *Reuters*, *The Guardian*, *The Financial Times*, *The New European*, *Sunday Post*, *The Conversation*, *The Press and Journal*\) has had a direct impact on the wider reach of UWS scholars’ work. The team were also interviewed for various BBC radio programmes and published numerous blog articles on the **UK in a Changing Europe** website **\[5.1\].** UWS fisheries publications have been accessed on their website by 12,816 visitors, mainly from those across the European continent. Van der Zwet also presented the research findings at a Scottish Parliament seminar attended by 12 MSPs and approximately 25 parliamentary staff \(researchers and clerks\) on 16 May 2018. Following this parliamentary engagement, UWS researchers led several workshops with **Marine Scotland** – a key policy body for fisheries – and a research framework agreement with the Scottish Parliament to provide evidence\-based advice to parliamentary researchers, civil servants and Government Ministers. The team’s research into the impact of Brexit on fisheries led to widespread media coverage in 2018, in outlets such as the Daily Express \(print readership: 1,613,000; circulation: 251,736\) The Sunday Post \(circulation: 476,000\) and The Press and Journal \(circulation: 41,700\), amongst others **\[5.11\].** 

 **Parliamentary reform** 

 Arnott’s **Academic Fellowship with the UK Parliament \(2016 to 2020\)** informed the future fellowships schemes in the UK legislatures, in that, a focus on the skills and benefits academics bring to academic fellowships led to a more structured fellowship scheme being introduced in winter 2020 **\[3.1\].** On the parliamentary side, there was a view that the fellowships offer a different perspective and potentially bring about change in behaviour **\[5.9\].** In November 2018, parliamentary fellows on the Political Studies Association/House of Commons Fellowship Scheme \(launched in November 2016\) hosted a workshop in the House of Commons on 16 November 2018, together with Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology \(POST\) staff. The workshop findings were used by the legislatures in the devolved UK as part of their respective Academic Fellowship Schemes **\[5.10\].** Arnott’s study of inter\-parliamentary relations influenced senior policy makers following the publication of her Institute of Wales Affairs report launch event in September 2020. Senior parliamentarians and officials were in attendance, e.g., the Chair of the Commons Liaison Select Committee, the Chair of the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee and the Former Senior Clerk House of Commons **\[5.9\].** Improved governance practices through sustained knowledge exchange, spanning European, UK and devolved levels are the key impacts of this diverse portfolio of ground\-breaking research **\[5.10\]**. This is yet another example of the signature approach of UWS research, which is to build relationships with policy stakeholders in order to foster meaningful changes in policy and practice. 

 **Public health and education reform** 

 The pioneering contribution of analysis methodology promoted by Connolly **\[3.A\-3.C\]** underpinned Healthcare Improvement Scotland’s \(HIS\) 2017 to 2020 Corporate Strategy through the inclusion of logic modelling as a corporate planning approach **\[3.C\]**. As a result, Connolly’s work enabled HIS \- an internationally leading health improvement agency \- to demonstrate their organisational impacts on the improvement of care. Connolly’s engagement with HIS also led to evaluation framework for the Death Certification Review Service. The major impact of this was that HIS improved accuracy of death certificates to provide better recording and public health information on the causes of death **\[5.2\].** This has allowed the service to make robust statements about the impact of the service in each of its annual reports. Further examples relate to the work undertaken by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network who have used contribution analysis methods to determine the publication guidelines for the treatment of glaucoma and to raise awareness of evidence\-based practice within optometry **\[5.2\]** and the creation of Intervention Framework for Children and Young People’s Mental Health and Wellbeing with NHS Education for Scotland **\[3.A\]**. For Education Scotland, who in partnership with the Scottish Government, global partners and the British Council promote international learning, Connolly worked with the Improvement and Evaluation Team \(10 highly\-qualified team members\) and the organisation’s 12 Board of Directors to build capacity \(via training in November 2015\) on the theory and practice of outcomes\-based approaches to evaluation **\[5.3\].** The contribution analysis approach radically shifted the evaluation work and corporate approach for the Scottish Attainment Challenge \(a major priority policy issue for the Scottish Government\) **\[5.3\]**. Connolly’s research with public services in the public health and education fields have led to him being appointed as expert advisor to the Scottish Parliament’s Covid\-19 Committee to scrutinise the pandemic response. 

 **Policing reform** 

 Police reform and the **integration of the BTP into Police Scotland** was influenced by Atkinson’s research, which reframed the policy debate **\[5.4\-5.6\]**. This ground\-breaking research study both directly informed and further contextualised media coverage of this issue. The research was cited in political debates in both the Scottish and UK parliaments on numerous occasions, as well as being referenced in a Commons debate pack, and raised in parliamentary questions. These debates had a direct bearing on policy change by the Scottish Government \(the integration process has been paused and alternative arrangements put in place\). A letter from the Scottish Conservative MSP for North East Scotland \(2016 to 2020\) to the Co\-Convenor of the Scottish Green Party and MSP for Glasgow \(2003 to 2020\) directly quoted Atkinson’s research **\[5.6\]**, and parliamentary evidence by Atkinson’s research collaborator \(Murray\) drew directly on the evidence base and data generated by the study. Other stakeholders, including the BTP Federation \(BTPF\) and Transport Salaried Staffs' Association \(TSSA\) responded to national and local media coverage – including in *The Times* \(print readership: 4,041,000; circulation: 417,298\), *The Daily Mail* \(print readership: 2,200,000; circulation: 1,134,184\), *The Herald* \(circulation: 28,900\), *The Scotsman* \(print readership: 78,000; circulation: 14,417\) *.* Atkinson’s research served to frame stakeholder policy positions. Atkinson was also interviewed by BBC Radio Scotland on the research findings and the policy impact of the project. This research was shortlisted for the Herald Higher Education Awards for Outstanding Research Project of the Year.

 **1. Summary of Impact** 

 The continuing rapid loss of biodiversity and the associated transformation of natural ecosystems is of major societal concern but as long as the economic value of nature is unknown or uncounted biodiversity is excluded from many decision\-making processes and treated as if its loss does not incur immediate costs and risks. Research co\-led by Professor Georgina Mace has helped develop an approach for valuing ecosystem services and accounting for natural capital. This research has shaped key components of the government’s ‘25 Year Environment Plan’ \(2018\) and the 2020 Environment Bill, which will help ensure the long\-term security of biodiversity and natural assets. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Landscapes generate a wide range of valuable ecosystem services, without which economic and social development would not be possible, yet land\-use decisions often ignore the value of these services. This body of research, co\-led by Mace in collaboration with economists, developed novel approaches to incorporate natural capital \(stocks of renewable resources, such as plants and animals\) and valuation of ecosystem services into decision\-making. Furthermore, the research demonstrated that failure to incorporate economic valuation of natural capital would lead to short\-term growth and social injustice. 

 **Putting the ecosystem services approach into practice in the UK \(from 2012 to2013\)** 

 This research investigated the social value \(in monetary terms\) of taking a broader set of ecosystem services into consideration when making large\-scale, land\-use decisions in the UK. The analysis demonstrated that the social value of ecosystem services that are not traded in markets \(such as recreation, carbon storage and soil fertility\) greatly exceed the market value of agriculture and timber, which usually underpin land use decisions. It thereby highlighted an important gap in existing policy for land use. The research also took a new approach to biodiversity valuing in ecosystem assessment that recognised its multiple roles in the ecosystem services framework. Recognising that biodiversity conservation outcomes were not monetizable, the analysis modelled the maintenance of species diversity and of high priority habitats as a constraint in the land use optimisation procedure. Using such an ecosystem services framework showed that, in contrast to perceptions that conservation measures are an additional cost, the opportunity costs of conservation are small or trivial while overall benefits to society increase many hundreds of times over \[R1\]. 

 **Developing an approach to natural capital assessment and valuation \(from 2013 to 2015\)** 

 This research developed and deployed an ecosystem\-science based approach to link ecosystem services to natural capital. In \[R2\], Mace led the work to propose a classification of natural assets and a desk\-based review to investigate the ecosystem service benefits that were degrading, or at risk of loss, in the UK. It led to specific recommendations to the UK Government that identified the ecosystem service benefits at highest risk \(e.g. clean water, wildlife conservation, climate regulation\) and identified ecosystem restoration projects that could secure them for the future \(e.g. restoring and conserving woodlands, maintaining wetlands and coastal marshes, restoring peatland\) \[R2\]. 

 **Embedding the value of biodiversity in economic analysis** 

 This research is a review of the ecological and biodiversity science in a book written for economists that outlines the approach taken. It introduces the distinction between ecological stocks and flows of ecosystem services in a paper geared to economics interests \[R3\]. A review of the book by an economist states this is *‘an excellently crafted exposition of the meaning, roles and status of biodiversity, chapter three is a must read.*’

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Between 2012 and 2018 Mace, as an influential member of the UK Government’s Natural Capital Committee, has worked closely with colleagues on the committee to provide independent advice to the government on the sustainable use of natural capital. Most of the work described in this case study was done in collaboration with Professor Ian Bateman, an environmental economist at the University of Exeter and member of the Natural Capital Committee, as well as the economists Julian Harlow \(Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \- Defra\) and Russell Elliot \(Natural Resources Wales\). Mace led the ecological aspects of the work. 

  

 **Developing and applying a comprehensive approach to the valuation of UK ecosystem services** 

 Market\-based decisions inevitably favour monetizable and tradeable services such as food and fuel, but the social value of non\-market services such as carbon storage, recreation or urban green space is hundreds of times greater than than the value of marketed food and other produce. The first part of the work, as presented in \[R1\], was influential in stimulating activities such as: 

1.  the funding of a ‘Valuing Nature Network’ \(VNN, a five\-year, GBP6.5m programme with over 2,000 members\) by NERC to grow research capability. As part of the Natural Capital Coalition \(NCC\) management team, Mace utilised \[R1\] as a framework to ensure a direct flow of evidence from the VNN to government, resulting in policy changes \(e.g. the UK Peatland Code\) via the project’s policy briefings and engagement network. \[E1\] 

1.  the Defra ‘Ecosystem Markets Task Force,’ which reported to Defra, DECC \(Department of Energy and Climate Change\) and BEIS \(Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\) and advised on opportunities for UK business from expanding green goods, services, products, investment vehicles and markets which value and protect ecosystem services. Working with Mace, Bateman briefed the Ecosystem Markets Task force in its early days on the UK National Ecosystem Assessment and its implications for business opportunities \[E2\]. 

1.  the cross\-sector NCC that was founded in the UK and is now developing globally. The NCC has become the global leader in mainstreaming natural capital approaches in the private sector, with over 370 leading orgnizations engaged. \[R1\] was cited directly in both the NCC’s biodiversity protocol and the UK Ecosystem Assessment \[E3\]. 

 **Development of natural capital approaches and their implementation in policy.** 

 Natural capital is recognised by economists as one of the four major types of capital that underpin human welfare \(along with human capital, financial capital and produced capital\). Ecosystem services are the flows of benefits to society that are delivered by well\-maintained natural capital assets. In \[R2\], Mace and her colleagues proposed a framework for the classification of natural assets and investigated the ecosystem service benefits that were degrading or at risk in the UK \(the natural capital ‘risk register’\), and \[R3\] was influential in translating ecological concepts for application by economists. This work led to specific recommendations to the government by the Natural Capital Committee, concerning the ecosystem service benefits at highest risk \(e.g., clean water, wildlife conservation, climate regulation\) and the ecosystem restoration projects that could secure them for the future \(e.g. restoring and conserving woodlands, maintaining wetlands and coastal marshes, restoring peatland\) \[E4\]. 

 **Advising on the UK Government’s 25 year Environment Plan and the 2020 Environment Act** 

 In 2017, a new Defra Secretary of State \(Michael Gove\) revitalised the research to meet the 2012 policy commitment ‘to be the first generation to leave the natural environment in a better state than it inherited’. The Natural Capital Committee recommended that this generation\-scale commitment needed a long\-term plan. The work described in \[R1\], \[R2\] and \[R3\] directly informed work in Defra to develop a 25 Year Environment Plan for England. This plan, launched by the Prime Minister in January 2018, highlighted six target outcomes for society which directly trace back to the risk register work \[R2\], as well as work contributed by Mace and colleagues to the Natural Capital Committee’s third report \[E5\]. Julian Barlow, deputy head of land\-use policy at DEFRA, has commented that *“At the heart of this 25 YEP \[Year Environment Plan\] is the natural capital conceptual framework and metrics developed by Professor Mace.”* \[E6\] 

 A significant consequence of the UK’s decision to leave the EU was the need to establish a system to replace the Common Agricultural Policy \(CAP\), to support food production but also to secure the wider benefits from the natural environment. Two new Government bills were developed in Defra: the Agriculture Bill and the Environment Bill. 

 The Agriculture Act \(2020\) adopts a novel objective that public money should support public goods, emphasising that land owners need to be incentivised to secure the non\-market goods of high public value that were highlighted in \[R1\], rather than private goods of limited public value. 

 The Environment Bill deals more centrally with environmental outcomes identified in the 25 Year Environment Plan. Legislation is pending \(the bill has reached the Report Stage and was debated by MPs on 26 January 2021\), but its framing and draft indicator set published by Defra in May 2019 is founded on the NCC framework \(described in section 2\) and the targets and indicators identified in \[R2\]. Defra’s Julian Barlow has written that “ *The Government is currently in the process of legislating for future Environmental Improvement Plans and a suit of environmental targets, all of which flow directly from the NCC’s \[Natural Capital Committee’s\] work – specifically the contributions of Prof Mace which wholly underpins the approach.”* \[E6\]

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Lancaster University Management School \(LUMS\) research transformed how innovation catalysts guided individual entrepreneurs and organisations through their innovation journey. Extant research recognised catalysts as places of innovation. Ford and Mason’s engaged research went further, showing how catalyst managers can enhance the catalyst offering, shape innovation processes and practices, and create evaluations that ensure long\-term viability and investment. Catalysts transformed through this research achieved significant impacts: the Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst \(SBC\) drew in GBP1.6 billion of innovation investments across >40 bioscience companies and created the world’s 3<sup>rd</sup> largest cell and gene therapy cluster. The Cabinet Office Open Innovation Team \(OIT\) generated GBP235 million of policy investments in technology and health, delivered policy\-shaping insight across 62 projects and 12 government departments, and enabled by LUMS evaluations it has become a permanent part of UK Government, shaping both engagement and innovation. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 LUMS research advanced understanding of how innovation catalysts are managed and developed. The research has shown how catalyst management teams \(typically 6\-10 people\) can, despite their small size, deliver exponential impact across a sector. Ford and Mason identified the catalysing practices that connect and develop novel ideas with markets to rapidly develop and commercialise innovations, growing the knowledge and business networks of innovators in a managed process of marketization. Catalysing practices manifest differently across domains: in bioscience, they connect scientific discoveries with funding, market expertise and business know\-how, curating relationships critical for the advancement and marketization of science; in government, these practices connect policymakers with academic experts from multiple disciplines to shape thinking and drive evidence\-led policymaking. This research addressed three essential areas of concern for catalyst managers across 3 interlinked research phases: 

 1\) how can catalyst managers **co\-develop their business model** to offer value to their entrepreneurs, scientists, and policymaker clients? 

 2\) how can catalyst managers **develop effective marketization processes** to bring together emerging ideas and markets to generate value? 

 3\) how do managers **evaluate, legitimise, and sustain their catalysing practices**? 

##  Phase 1: Co\-developing business models 

 Phase 1 identified the practices of managers seeking to catalyse the development of new market offerings by: *co\-developing* their business model and market offerings with partners and service users; and *integrating resources* to generate value. 

 In 2010, Mason’s 18\-month engaged ethnographic inquiry, using 54 video diaries \[R1\] and 102 archive documents \[R2\] \(with Spring\), revealed the fine\-grained, collaborative management practices involved in developing and delivering innovative market offerings \[R1\] and co\-developing the business model *with* key individuals from organisations \[R2\]. Business model co\-development practices produce new understandings of what matters in a particular market. People and workplaces shape new market offerings, generate value by co\-developing a shared strategic direction and ongoing evaluation of innovation actions \[R1\]. In 2012, Ford and Friesl’s 10\-month ethnography of an innovative collaboration shed new light on the interplay between the evolution of purpose and the integration of distributed resources. As resources are acquired to achieve initial goals, they reveal new possibilities for value creation. This reshapes purpose, generating more ambitious goals \[R3\] 

##  Phase 2: Developing effective marketization processes 

 A marketization process is the central element of a catalyst’s offering to its clients. Phase 2 identified the practices catalyst managers can adopt, to advance science towards markets. Insights from \[R1\] and \[R2\] were used to design an engaged\-research project with SBC: to develop a new marketization process for bioscience innovations. Ford, Mason and Friesl conducted 47 in\-depth interviews and 15 user\-engagement observations with catalyst managers and bioscience entrepreneurs to understand what they needed from the catalyst. They ran 3 innovation workshops, sharing the findings and co\-developing SBCs business model with others as the work progressed. The research insights helped SBC to develop a process that repeatedly exposed emergent bioscience innovations to the right, strategically selected experts \(IP lawyers, other bioscience entrepreneurs, and specialist scientists from ‘big pharma’\) at the right time \[R4\], changing the market and the innovation in relation to each other. They conceptualised these exposures as ‘choreographed contestations’ \[R5\]. They enabled entrepreneurs to work out their next innovative steps \[R5\], for example, revealing a GBP70 billion global market for a scientific discovery, originally thought to be GBP8 billion, enabling the entrepreneur to rethink and adapt their scientific and market orientation. 

##  Phase 3: Evaluating, legitimising, and sustaining catalysing practices 

 Catalysts face a significant evaluation challenge because they generate value for dispersed groups of stakeholders. Phase 3 research revealed the approaches to evaluation and legitimisation developed by catalysts to secure long\-term funding and sustainability. 

 The work with SBC led to an invitation to work with the Cabinet Office OIT in 2016. Two years of engaged, ethnographic research \(encompassing 52 in\-depth interviews, 4 weeks shadowing, 18 user\-engagement observations and 6 workshops for the OIT\), revealed the boundary\-spanning practices required to facilitate and co\-ordinate multiple collaborations across academic and government departments and agencies. Ford, Mason and Whitham used participatory design theory to co\-develop a multidisciplinary intervention with the OIT \[R6\]. The research revealed a co\-design process for visual evaluation tools. The extended research engagement with Cabinet Office enabled an in\-depth evaluation of the OIT \[R7\] for senior officials and investors.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 LUMS research has played a critical role in the success of two catalyst organisations: the SBC and the OIT. Through extended engagements, Ford and Mason have brought LUMS research to bear on their business models, marketization processes, and the evaluations used to secure the sustainability of these catalysts. These organisations achieved significant, far\-reaching impacts in their respective domains. What follows describes: 1\) the impacts generated by these catalysts; 2\) the impacts of LUMS research in shaping and sustaining each of these two catalysts. 

##  1\) The impacts of SBC and OIT 

 **SBC**: Created with a GBP50 million investment from government, private and third sector bioscience organisations in 2011, SBC set out to advance the marketization of science in the UK \[S1\]. In 2014 SBC deployed LUMS research \[R1, R2, R3\] to co\-develop the concept of ‘science\-centred’ business models for science incubation, predicated on new understandings of how to connect science with markets \[S1, S2\]. As SBC evolved and improved its ways of working, the articulation of its unique catalyst offer, and the value of its business model, it took on an increasingly significant role in developing the largest cluster of bioscience R&D in the UK \[S3\(a,b\)\]. This cluster represents 34% of registered UK biotech firms, which attracted GBP2.2 billion investment in 2018, a 65% increase between 2016 and 2018 \[S3\(c\)\]. This successful catalyst has: 

-  Drawn investment of GBP1.6 billion into bioscience through transformed funding practices \[S3\(a\)\]; 

-  Accelerated innovation across its >40 bioscience start\-up tenants, preparing them to enter multi\-billion\-dollar global markets \[S3\(a\), R5\]; 

-  Generated an additional GBP55 million of UK government investment to create the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult Manufacturing Unit on its campus \[S3\(d\)\]; 

-  Created the 3<sup>rd</sup> largest global hub for cell and gene therapy innovation \[S3\(b\)\]. 

 SBC’s success also influenced the BioIncubator Forum, which has been responsible for catalysing half of all life science start\-ups in the UK between 2015 and 2020 \[S3\(e\), S1\]. *“As Chair of the UK BioIncubator Forum, I shared SBC’s learning about science\-centred business models with our 24 members…Your research with SBC on the science\-centred approach offers a powerful representation of how we should support emerging science”*  then Business Development Director, SBC \[S1\]. 

 **OIT:** The OIT was launched in 2016, initially as a 2\-year pilot that was extended following the LUMS Evaluation \[R7\], \[S4\]; Its mandate was to improve collaborative, evidence\-led policy innovation, funded by approximately GBP2.7 million of investment over 5 years: 

 “*I am sometimes a little frustrated that we don’t make better use of academics…. We clearly have an immense pool of academic talent on our doorstep and, while there are many excellent examples of collaboration, it often feels like we could be doing more”,* then Cabinet Secretary, Head of the UK Civil Service \[S5\]. 

 In 2016 the OIT deployed LUMS research \[R1, R2, R3\] to co\-develop the concept of an evidence\-centred business model, predicated on new understandings of how to connect academic research and expertise with policy\-making initiatives. This work enabled the OIT to integrate expertise from across government and academia to develop their offer, and create a UK\-wide academic\-policy network, curated by them, that has: 

-  delivered 62 policy\-projects across 12 government departments \[S4\] \(typically UK govt. has 250 policies in play at any one time, across 23 ministerial departments, as described in this  [Government blog](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/11/13/explaining-gov-policy-gov-uk/)\), 

-  devised the GovTech Catalyst \(a GBP20 million policy investment\) \[S4, S6\], 

-  informed the National Leadership Centre’s UK\-wide offer for senior officials \[S4, S7\], 

-  shaped the 2017 Green Paper ‘ *Children and Young People’s Mental Health Provision*’, which led to GBP215 million additional investment in adolescent mental health, supporting Mental Health Schools Training, and creation of a GBP15 million \- GBP20 million per annum fund to create and train a ‘Designated Senior Lead for Mental Health’ in all schools in England \[S4, S6, S8\], 

-  created a Covid \(C\-19\) 800\+ expert database for 12\+ government departments \[S4, S6\], 

-  produced C\-19 reports to Cabinet Office and the Foreign Office \[S4, S6\], 

-  organised C\-19 Academic Seminars with audiences of between 80 to 120 policy makers. \[S4, S6\]. 

 The OIT’s work has been recognised for changing both engagement culture and innovation culture across government and academia; winning the ‘Cabinet Office Innovator Award’ in 2017, and the President’s Medal from the British Academy of Management in 2019, *“By drawing on your research and your support we have created a powerful exemplar within Whitehall, not only in terms of motivating others to deepen collaboration with academics, but also shaping their understandings of what is possible through business model innovation”,* Head of OIT \[S4\]. 

##  2\) The role of LUMS research in shaping SBC and OIT 

 **SBC:** LUMS research enabled SBC to develop its new catalyst offering for entrepreneurs, advancing the speed, success and value of bioscience innovation in the UK. LUMS research showed SBC how to co\-develop their business model and integrate distributed resources \[R1, R2, R3\]. Rather than developing their business model in isolation, SBC learned to work with bioscience investors, scientific\-entrepreneurs and big pharma to co\-develop a place, process and >4,000 strong community for catalysing innovation \[R5\], \[S1, S2\]. SBC co\-created novel ways to integrate capabilities \[R3\] from their growing network to make scarce resources and expertise accessible, supporting the marketization of science at critical moments in the innovation journey. Through research to understand the form and function of the complex strategic nets within which SBC is embedded \[R4, R5\], Ford and Mason enabled the emergence of collaborative practices that built a deeper understanding of individual and system\-level needs and goals, creating strong support for this catalysing process. “ *Your intensive work with our team at this stage was critical in shaping much of our thinking on business model evolution, and specifically how we use our resources effectively”,* then Business Development Director, SBC \[S1\]. 

 LUMS research \[R2, R4, R5\] became a central plank of the legitimacy work of SBC \[S1, S2\]. Ford’s conceptualisation and articulation of SBC’s value proposition,  [presented at the SBC/GSK 2016 Open Innovation Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiZvdkNL7fU&t=2s), framed the evaluative practices required to support and legitimise SBC’s business model \[S2\]. Critically, these new evaluations protected emergent catalysing practices from being subject to dysfunctional, destructive, traditional metrics, “ *Incubators have been evaluated badly for years, using the wrong metrics, which can kill innovation. Your research created the clearest articulation of our business model, revealing how we create value, and enabled us to push back against those metrics, and ensure that we were evaluated in the right way, protecting our business model and our new ways of working*”, founding CEO, SBC \[S2\]. 

 The LUMS catalyst research continued to shape managerial thought and action at SBC. In 2019 Mason was commissioned by the Chief Operating Officer of SBC to draw together research insights and deliver a detailed review of *‘Incubation, Acceleration and Commercialisation at Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst’* for the SBC board. 

 **OIT:** LUMS research enabled the Cabinet Office OIT to co\-develop its catalyst business model and offering for academics and policymakers, advancing the speed, success and value of evidence\-based policymaking across Whitehall \[R1, R2, R3\]. This research enabled the OIT to identify and manage the early\-stage challenges of incorporating multiple agendas and ways of working into their new organisation structures and practice, transforming their offer. Later, the OIT continued to draw on this work to help address the need for sustainability through funding diversification and scale up, through the incorporation of new partners, “ *Your guidance over the course of the pilot was extremely valuable and heavily influenced my thinking on how to grow the team and its impact…Your work on business model co\-development and the co\-ordination of multiple agendas and resources to support the scale up of an organisation has been of great value*”, Head of OIT \[S4\]. 

 The theory of ‘choreographed contestations’ developed through Ford and Mason’s prior research \[R5\] helped the OIT to shape and articulate their processes and to valorise novel management practices. Rather than focusing on single engagement events, the OIT learnt how to co\-ordinate extended, evolving relationships across government departments, higher education institutions and research agencies to co\-develop an increasingly in\-demand catalysing process offer \[R4, R5\] \[S4\]. “ *You helped me make the transition from an early\-stage start\-up with few staff, a small number of projects, a limited understanding of our offer and an underdeveloped approach to managing our model, into an established Whitehall team with lots of interesting projects, 10 permanent staff, a clear offer to customers and a well thought out strategy for phase two that will see us grow to 20 staff in 2021/22*”, Head of OIT \[S4\]. 

 Ford and Mason’s 2016 appointment as Cabinet Office Policy Fellows, specifically to support the OIT’s development, enabled them to apply their research \(with Whitham\). Together, in 2018 they developed critical management tools \[R6, R7\] \[S9\] with OIT, combining multiple forms of expertise from a complex network of academics, PhD students, research councils, and policy\-writing officials. They enabled a continuous process of reflection and adaptation that responded to the emerging market for ideas within Whitehall. This developed the OIT’s ability to conceptualise and deliver timely, impactful policy innovations across government. “ *Your ongoing evaluation work enabled us to continually review and refine our practice. The robustness of this evaluation was instrumental in enabling us to create and communicate a valuable offer, and secure reinvestment*”, Head of OIT \[S4\]. 

 A research\-based review and evaluation of the OIT \[R7\] provided a critical reflection on the work of this team, identifying 21 recommendations for action. Drawing on the full body of LUMS research noted above, the review was delivered to Cabinet Office by Ford and Mason. This report played a critical role in ensuring the future of the OIT \[S4\], validating the development pathway for this increasingly important part of UK Government, 

 *“I remain very supportive of this effort and it's great it's done so well. For the next phase, we need to implement the recommendations of the independent review*”, Chief Executive of the UK Civil Service \[S10\].

topic we find research that supports and informs business, entrepreneurialism, management as well as research informing public and private investments often for regional growth and development as well as policies aimed at improving productivity and firm growth in various forms. Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research. Several projects are also concerned with sustainable practices in business and entrepreneurialism for a greener economy and with enabling more socially responsible corporate practices.",13.48,20.62,44.81,28.2,51.58,29.59,41,19,214,113,79,7,498,220,51,10,0.075,0.1582831802343997,0.1571428571428571,0.0970597205824478,-0.0444444444444444,0.1060533700795329,176

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Legal cases related to Islamic Extremism the UK have increased rapidly and revealed an acute need for expert knowledge on violence in Islamic thought. Poorly understood items of evidence \(online materials, communications data, and seized items\) have led to possible miscarriages of justice. Through expert advice, witness testimony and practitioner training aimed at informing jurors, judges, barristers, solicitors and police officers, Gleave’s activities have aimed to address this deficiency. Utilising the results of Gleave’s research on Islam\-related violence, these activities have improved legal efficiency, enhanced the justice process, and enabled courts to make better evidenced judgements. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Since 2009, Gleave’s research projects on legitimate and illegitimate violence in Islamic thought have exposed deep links between contemporary Islamic discussions of violence and their historic antecedents. Gleave’s principal finding is that contemporary Muslim arguments about violence – by so\-called “extremist” and “mainstream” ideologues alike – are organically linked to premodern debates in works of Islamic jurisprudence \( *fiqh* and related disciplines\).  Gleave has built up reading skills and practices in the reading of *fiqh* texts over 30 years of research, following “deep reading” methodologies common in the study of premodern intellectual history.  Islamic activist groups \(including Hizbullah, HAMAS, al\-Qa’ida and Islamic State\) are often designated, both in the media and in the secondary literature, as “modern”, “terrorist” movements, deviating from a supposed “orthodox” “established” Islamic thought, and those who support them are classed as “extremist” in the legal definition of the term. In contrast, “orthodox” or “mainstream” Islamic expression is presented as having deeper historical roots, and therefore greater authenticity.  Gleave’s research has challenged these preconceptions, by demonstrating how premodern legal debates relating to the legitimacy of violence in the Islamic religio\-legal code \(Shari’a\) have been reformulated in contemporary Islamic discussions.  This led to a more nuanced picture of the historical development of Islamic thought on violence and a deeper understanding of the intellectual context of the religious justifications for Islam\-related violence in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries. The principal findings can be summarised: 

 **F1:** In the Islamic intellectual tradition, particularly around ethics and law, violent acts have no special category of analysis. There is no notion \(in terms of a word or an idea\) in Islamic juristic thought which corresponds to “violence” \(as used both in the English language and in Western ethical discourse\). This, to an extent, explains the refusal of many modern Islamic thinkers and movements to unequivocally “reject violence” when a response is demanded by international bodies. \(\[ **3.1** Vol.III\]\) 

 **F2:** Islamic thought on the legitimacy of violence is dynamic.  There is no single “proper”, “orthodox” or even “mainstream” view of which particular “violent” acts are forbidden \(and illegitimate\), permitted \(and legitimate\) or necessary \(or obligatory\). \[ **3.6**\] 

 **F3:** Much of the discourse of modern Islam\-related activist movements – including so\-called “extremist” and “mainstream” groups \- is linked to these premodern legal discussions; a proper assessment of material associated with such movements requires this contextual knowledge. \[ **3.1** Vol.III\] 

 These findings, and the expertise built up during the underpinning research, facilitate the proper assessment of evidence in Islam\-related extremism and terrorism cases, the fairest, research\-based way to present a case for or against individuals, and the impact on freedoms of religion and expression. 

 Findings F1\-F3 are the result of three major peer\-assessed, research council funded projects between 2009 and 2019: 

1.  *Understanding Shari’a: Past Present Imperfect Present* \( [www.usppip.eu](http://www.usppip.eu/)\); \(2016\-2019\) Humanities in the European Research Area \(HERA\). €1.2million. 

1.  *Global Uncertainties Leadership Fellowship: Islamic Reformulations*, RCUK \(through ESRC, September 2012\-September 2015, amount: £495,384, plus Impact Supplement of £50,000: Total £545,384\) 

1.  *Legitimate and Illegitimate Violence in Islamic Thought*  [\(<ins>www.livitproject.net</ins>](http://www.livitproject.net/)\), AHRC/ESRC, \(January 2009\-December 2012, amount: £592,342\) 

 The projects have resulted in a significant publication list, including 21 articles and book chapters and a dedicated book series \( *Violence in Islamic Thought* *I\-III* edited by Gleave et al\).  The project activities \(workshops, conferences and fieldwork\) created an extensive international network of scholars working on violence in Islamic thought, through which the projects’ research findings are debated and tested. Together \(projects, their activities and their publications\) form a major contribution to the academic understanding of the relationship between Islam and violence, and the history of related intellectual debates.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Police investigations, arrests and court proceedings involving British Muslims accused of supporting and promoting terrorism increased significantly following the military success of the Islamic State group \(IS, previously Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\) in 2014. Material seized and used as evidence of an individual’s extremist views or support for terrorist activity was voluminous and complex.  Police officers, solicitors, barristers, and other legal practitioners lacked the expertise to understand the context for this material.  Criminal cases, mainly brought under counter\-terrorism legislation \(the Terrorism Acts of 2000 and 2006, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005\) were followed by other cases.  Parents accused of Islamic extremism were subjected to local authority investigations with a view to child protection. Religiously conservative Muslims applying for asylum or involved in residence/immigration appeals were assessed for extremist views, as part of the legal process. The need for analysis of the extremism/terrorism\-related material produced in evidence was critical for both investigating parties \(counter\-terrorism police, LA/immigration investigating officers\), defendants, and legal practitioners involved in such cases. Gleave’s impact on meeting this critical need has been in three forms of impact: 

 **\(1\)** **Changes in professional practice** in relation to Islamic extremism and Islam\-related terrorism, through the provision of training for, and collaborative discussion opportunities with, police and legal practitioners. 

 **\(2\)** **Influencing the conduct of investigations**, and, in court, the approach of legal teams acting for the relevant parties in specific cases by providing expert advice and testimony to investigating agencies \(counter\-terrorism police, the Home Office and local authorities\) and legal practitioners \(solicitors, the Crown Prosecution Service, defence and prosecution teams\). In some cases, this led to shorter trials and significant cost savings. 

 **\(3\)** **Influencing the policy debates concerning the proposed 2015 Extremism Bill** through the “Thoughtcrimes” seminar series, policy\-directed blogposts with the Bingham Centre and an All\-Party Parliamentary Group meeting. 

 **\(1\)** **Changes in professional practice** Police officers and legal professionals usually worked with ideas of “true” and “false” Islamic attitudes towards the justification of violence. In Gleave’s tailored practitioner training, Gleave used his research findings \(F1, F2\) to challenge these attitudes. The training, then, enabled prosecution/defence teams and counter\-terrorism police to work on investigations and cases with a deeper awareness of the religious and ideological commitment of individuals involved.  This prevented costly, inaccurate and potentially unjustified lines of enquiry being pursued against suspects. 

 Gleave has delivered numerous training events, including the Practitioner\-Academic seminar: *Islam in Court: Muslim Belief and Practice in Recent Extremism\-related Cases* \( **5.1**\) on 24/6/19 convened with Joel Bennathan QC *.* The event, attended by 25 specialist barristers and solicitors included a briefing paper distributed to defence teams through Doughty Street Chambers.  Gleave has also led training events for law\-enforcement officers, including a series of training engagements for Counter Terrorist Policing North West unit, the final meeting of which was held on 17/9/19 at Forces HQ, Greater Manchester Police.  Attended by 45 CT officers from across the region, the training consisted of appropriately pitched lectures and case studies of past cases. Questionnaire results from the event \( **5.2**\) demonstrate how practitioners gained a clearer understanding of radical Islam and violence \(e.g. ““ *I moved from little to no awareness to an understanding of \[Radical Islam’s\] debates and complexities*”\).  The responses also demonstrate how working practices post\-training, including the procedures for the assessment of allegedly incriminating material. Comments included “ *we will adopt a different approach to interpreting communications detail/mind\-set evidence*” and improved “ *questioning techniques*” of suspects; others said “ *we will re\-examine the relevance of any potential evidence*” in future evidence. From this training, 85% of participants said their understanding had improved, and that it will be useful in future investigations. 

 **\(2\)** **Influencing the conduct of investigations** 

 Material linked to Islamist activist movements is the principal “mindset” evidence in individual cases. A common prosecution argument was that in allegedly holding a particular belief, an individual was deviating from the Islamic norm, and therefore can be legitimately classed as an “extremist”; a common defence argument was that the defendant’s beliefs formed part of the variety of Muslim opinion on a matter over time, and therefore he or she was in no way deviant or extremist. Gleave’s advice, written reports and court testimony, based on his research findings \(F3\), enabled the relevant legal teams, and the court generally, to gain a full understanding of the context for the material being presented as evidence of an individual’s extremist beliefs or terrorist activities. In civil cases and other legal hearings \(defamation, child protection, immigration, deportation, and asylum\), Gleave’s reports enabled a contextualised understanding of the material used in evidence \(based on his research findings F3\).  In all these cases \- criminal and civil, family protection and Home office hearings \- Gleave’s advice and evidence \(written and oral\) enhanced understanding and operated alongside other pieces of evidence to inform the final decision of the court or hearing. 

 Between 1/8/2013 and 1/9/2020, Gleave provided in\-depth expert advice and expert testimony in 35 Islamic extremism and terrorism\-related police investigations, family and child protection hearings and criminal legal cases. Some of these were high profile \( **5.7**\) and of national significance including: 

 The prosecution and conviction of the Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary for inviting membership of a proscribed terrorist group \( **5.8**\) \(K O’Raghallaigh, defence barrister, ““ *Without \[Gleave\] we simply couldn’t have explained... what the defendants’ were saying.*”\) \( **5.3**\) 

 The case brought by Imam Shakeel Begg against Andrew Neil and the BBC for defamation \( **5.9**\) \(W Bennett, claimant’s barrister: *“\[Gleave\] gave the proper alternative view to the view put forward by the BBC’s expert.  So the court was able, properly, to reach a decision*.”\) \( **5.3**\) 

 The prosecution of Martin Matthews \(leader of Fathers for Justice\) for trespass *\(*“ *Without a shadow of a doubt things changed because of his evidence*” *,* B. Sian, defence solicitor *\)* \( **5.3**\) 

 Police Investigation of alleged associates of Salman Abedi \(Manchester Arena Bomber\).  \( **5.10**\) “He was pivotal, if I’m honest with you. Without \[Gleave’s\] assessments… \[the evidence\] may well have caused us to take a different action.” \( **5.3**\) 

 Whilst direct linkage between evidence and outcome cannot be proven \(jurors are not permitted to give reasons for their verdict\), legal practitioners record the effect of Gleave’s evidence on specific trials \( **5.3**\): **R v Mizan ur Rahman**, S Tadafur \(defence barrister\): *“From the defence perspective, without his reports we wouldn’t have had a leg to stand on.  We needed an expert and he provided evidence that we desperately needed in the case.”*; **R v Alamgir**, A King, *“\[Gleave\] helped us make a proper assessment of the Crown’s evidence; and helped us understand and evaluate our client’s instructions as well”*; **R v Alam** – M Hussain QC \(defence barrister\): *“He holds a very unique position… \[Gleave’s evidence\] made the jury and then the judge understand \[the\] often opaque and complex issues, well.*”; \[Gleave\] “is in a… unique position… you may have a number of experts in the country but you rarely have somebody’ with Gleave’s skills. **R v Ibrahim Hassan** – \[Fahad Ansari, defence solicitor: “\[Gleave’s\] evidence was very critical in overcoming that hurdle” of “the assumption that \[our client\] was a threat to national security.”  Some practitioners report on legal efficiency and costs saving resulting from Gleave’s evidence: **R v Khalid Al** \- D Gottleib, defence barrister, “the prosecution immediately agreed all but 2 paragraphs of \[Gleave’s\] report… shortening the case by a month… you’re talking about £150,000 worth of court time saved.” 

 **\(3\)** **Influencing the policy debates concerning the proposed 2015 Extremism Bill** Based on research findings \(F1\-3\), Gleave led public discussions around the “Extremism Bill” proposed in 2015 including convening, in collaboration with the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, the high profile “Thoughtcrimes” Seminar Series, the first held on 14/5/2015, coming the day after the announcement of the proposed Extremism Bill by then Home Secretary Theresa May. The seminar, addressed by major legal figures, including prominent defence barrister Joel Bennathan QC and the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, initiated legal debate around the proposed Bill.  It was accompanied by the much\-cited blog post \( **5.4**\), co\-authored by Gleave and Lawrence McNamara, Deputy Director of the Bingham Centre.  These collaborative activities with the Bingham Centre led to MPs and Peers establishing an All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on the Rule of Law \( **5.5**\) chaired by RH Dominic Grieve \( **5.5**\).  The APPG was the first meeting of a cross party group of MPs and Peers involved in the parliamentary response to the Extremism Bill. Gleave was invited to speak at the first meeting at the Houses of Parliament \(14/7/2015\) on “Non\-Violent Extremism and the rule of Law” where he, based on his research and his work as an expert witness, detailed his assessment of the Extremism Bill’s negative effects on fundamental freedoms \(including the freedom of religion and the freedom of speech\), and the potential alienating effects on the Muslim community. The APPG chair, RH Dominic Grieve MP \(former Attorney General, 2010\-14, and chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, 2014\-2019\) notes that \( **5.5**\) “ *Professor Gleave was invited… because of his work… on extremism in the legal process, including his acting as an expert witness in numerous Islam\-related terrorist cases.*”  Gleave’s presentation, he states, enabled the meeting to understand that “ *there were many traditional/conservative non violent Muslim voices which could be classified as ‘non violent extremism’ under the proposed legislation.*” 

 Gleave’s work on the APPG, he explains, helped “ *MPs and Peers focus their work on the Extremism Bill*” \( **5.5**\). Mr. Grieve notes that “ *Gleave’s work had a significant impact on the debate surrounding this controversial piece of legislation*” and his work “ *helped to galvanise the parliamentary response* *and* *the Bill’s eventual abandonment in 2017*”.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 **Economic significance:** Towards the development of a food assurance scheme, Professors Elliott, Mooney and Dr Haughey developed, validated and implemented innovative techniques to detect and monitor a broad spectrum of feed\-related contaminants. The resultant Food Fortress scheme was implemented in 2014 and by 2019, 5,000,000 tonnes of animal feed \(Value: GBP1,250,000,000\), supplied by 80 member companies were tested. 

 **Industrial/Societal significance:** The Food Fortress scheme is recognised internationally as a World\-leading risk management and feed quality assurance scheme. Due to the Food Fortress brand and resultant increased confidence in food production, additional international dairy sales from Northern Ireland are estimated at GBP50,000,000 \(2015–2019 data\).

1.  **Underpinning research** 

 Contamination of animal feedstuffs and the consequences for animal and human health are well recognised. The island of Ireland imports millions of tons of feed materials from across the world and as supply chains became more complex, this results in increased potential for accidental and intentional contamination. In addition, new feed safety issues continue to arise both from existing threats as seen with increases in natural toxin levels, such as mycotoxins, due to climate\-related effects, but also from emerging diet\-associated chemical contaminants e.g. pesticides or heavy metals. 

 Professors Elliott, Mooney and Dr Haughey and team have led and continue to lead an intensive research programme to develop, validate and implement innovative techniques to detect and monitor a broad spectrum of feed\-related contaminants, which when incorporated within a risk\-based sampling approach, provide a supply chain\-wide quality assurance scheme. For example, the team published the use of laboratory\-based spectroscopic techniques, coupled to chemometrics in 2013 and 2015 for rapid screening of feed adulteration in response to the 2008 melamine infant\-milk scandal, which emerged in China and the United States **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. The scandal encompassed adulteration of infant formula milk with melamine to increase the nitrogen content of milk, but the resultant toxic effects resulted in 6 infant deaths and 54,000 babies being hospitalised. In order to detect melamine at low cost, Professor Elliott and Dr Haughey developed rapid and portable Near Infrared\-based spectroscopic tools **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. Advances in the capability of mass spectrometry to detect feed\-associated contaminants have also been exploited to develop a multi\-mycotoxin analysis methodology **\[3.3\]**, which Northern Ireland feed industries and processing sectors rely on to determine mycotoxin risks since the publication of the method in 2015. This method is used routinely to investigative unexplained performance issues in the pig/poultry sectors. 

 Similarly, the dioxins food crisis in 2008, in which Irish pork were contaminated through their feed with this highly toxic chemical, resulted in Professors Elliott and Mooney developing low cost, high throughput metabolomic detection technologies **.** Development of dioxin detection technologies are, nonetheless, extremely difficult, costly and facilities for such analysis were previously limited. As a  consequence, monitoring of feed samples for dioxins in the Irish Republic was previously only performed on a quarterly basis, Professors Elliott and Mooney undertook a series of experiments to identify biomarkers for animals exposed to dioxins and dioxin\-like compounds that could be used to screen livestock **\[3.4, 3.5\]**. 

 Professor Elliott and team also undertook a detailed analysis of all feed contamination incidents globally over a 5\-year period, within this REF cycle. From this they developed a ‘Risk Register’ for the animal feed industry, followed by development of the Food Fortress scheme **\[5.2\]**, allowing a 500% increase in testing performed for feed contaminants by industry. Specifically, research development underpinning the ‘Food Fortress’ scheme demonstrated high sensitivities, enabling sample compositing to be undertaken, which when coupled to a stratified sampling programme, allows for rigorous monitoring across the whole year. The Food Fortress scheme is based on a range of analytical techniques and tests developed within the Institute of Global Food Security, QUB based on animal feed safety and using innovative High Resolution Mass Spectrometry\-based metabolomics as an ‘early warning system’ for farm animal exposure to dioxin contamination based on characterisation of key biomarkers of exposures, and a suite of multi\-analyte mass spectrometry screening assays for monitoring of an array of prioritised natural and man\-made chemical toxins and contaminants **\[3.6\]**.

1.  Details of the impact 

 Development of the ‘Food Fortress’ scheme ensued largely in response to the 2008 dioxin crisis on the island of Ireland, during which a total of approximately 30,000 tonnes of pig meat product was recalled and destroyed \(including 5,000 tonnes outside Ireland\) due to ingestion of feed with high levels of the highly toxic chemicals **\[5.1\]**. Additionally, over 170,000 pigs and 5,700 cattle from farms that received contaminated product were culled on a precautionary basis. The dioxin crisis fraud in the animal feed sector was found to be caused by a single small business, whereby a small quantity of highly toxic dioxin and poly\-chlorinated biphenyl chemical compounds from contaminated transformer oil made its way into the animal feed supply chain and subsequently into pig fat deposits. The contamination was eventually detected by the national monitoring programme leading to multiple farm closures, major animal welfare issues and a global recall of Irish pork, resulting in the loss of an estimated 1,800 jobs. The incident was estimated to have cost the economy of island of Ireland over EUR120,000,000 **\[5.1\]** and resulted in a highly damaging conflict between regulatory agencies and food industries  and a suit of recommendations to avoid such instances in the future **\[5.2\]**. 

 Professor Elliott and team were approached by the feed sector to identify ways of preventing the occurrence of such catastrophic feed\-related contamination in the future. A programme was devised, called Food Fortress, that increased the level of testing for all high\-risk chemical contaminants by over 500% without any additional industrial costs. The Food Fortress scheme was launched by QUB as a pilot in 2014 with 19 large animal feed companies involved. Membership to the scheme is voluntary with an annual fee, but the benefits in terms of consumer confidence outweigh the costs as demonstrated by the growth of the pilot towards adoption by all animal feed companies in Northern Ireland by 2016, and by August 2019 the Food Fortress membership has risen to over 80 with companies recruited from the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom **\[5.3\]**.  From a position of crisis, the Food Fortress scheme is now used as a major marketing tool by the UK and Republic Ireland food industries, with new markets in South East Asia having been secured due to this world leading feed contamination risk management system being in place **\[5.4\]**. Food Fortress has been presented to over 120 buyers on inward missions from 20 Middle East and Asian countries. As a direct result the NI dairy sector has reported additional sales in the region of GBP50,000,000 in the first 4 years of operation of the Food Fortress scheme **\[5.4\].** 

 Dairy council testimonial **\[5.4\]:** 

 *‘The success of these programs can be seen in buyer attitudes and increased sales. The most recent trade fair attended was Food Ingredients China, held in Shanghai in March 2019. Evaluation showed that 100% of buyers who visited the stand were impressed and 100% stated their confidence and trust in NI dairy products had increased. In terms of sales, by end of year 6...it is estimated these programmes will have delivered additional sales around £50 million.’* 

 This highly novel approach to contaminant monitoring and the acceptance of such techniques by the feed industries on the island of Ireland is a clear indication of the trust and reliance that has grown between the QUB academics and the feed industry **\[5.5\]**. 

 Food Standards agency testimonial **\[5.5\]:** 

 *‘In 2019, the Northern Ireland Grain Trade Association outlined the work of Food Fortress to the FSA’s NI Food Advisory Committee \(NIFAC\) chaired by the FSA’s NI Board Member. The committee commended the Food Fortress scheme as a great example of industry\-led assurance done properly, noting  that  a  substantial  number  of  businesses  from  the  Republic  of  Ireland were also engaged in the scheme in addition to those from NI’.* 

 However, testing methods, no matter how quick and reliable, need to be sufficient to deal with the magnitude of the challenges presented in monitoring many millions of tonnes of feed materials each year. This testing must be embedded within a risk\-based sampling approach, based on a sample compositing and analysis strategy. This is very much how the Food Fortress is structured and each year the Institute for Global Food Security updates this sampling and testing scheme based on risks identified, and by introducing new approaches to speed up the programme of testing whilst maintaining cost\-effectiveness. The testing scheme undertaken by Food Fortress has been approved by both the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland and The Food Standards Agency \(NI\) \[ **5.6** outlines the details of the farm quality assurance scheme underpinned by feed approved from food fortress, and **5.7** outlines the agreement in place to share data from Food Fortress to the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland and The Food Standards Agency \(NI\)\].  The Livestock and Meat Commission for Northern Ireland is an Executive Non\-Departmental Public Body and their regulations include all farms in NI under their control purchase feed from members of the Food Fortress **\[5.6, 5.7\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study shows the power of high\-quality research to effect change in an emerging economy \(Chile\). Through purposive engagement activity, Newcastle University researchers have influenced government socio\-economic policy, direct allocation of resources, adoption of innovative methods of policy implementation, and the conduct and decisions of entrepreneurs and business incubators. Precise impacts have included \(1\) the initiation of the first Social Impact Bond programme in 2018 \(USD50,000,000\); \(2\) supporting implementation of Social Impact Bonds; \(3\) the redesign and implementation of the Chilean economic development agency’s \(CORFO\) seed\-funding programme; and \(4\) upskilling social entrepreneurs and incubators through impact assessment training. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 This case has been underpinned by two strands of research conducted at Newcastle University by an interdisciplinary team with expertise in public sector management, social accounting and entrepreneurship in developing countries. Firstly, research on the merits of funding social innovation and social enterprises through Social Impact Bonds; secondly, research on the funding of entrepreneurship in emerging\-market contexts, with a particular focus on the wider social economy of Chile. 

 **Research on SIBs in the UK** 

 Since 2010, Social Impact Bonds \(SIBs\), a type of outcome\-based investment mechanism for enterprises operating in the social economy, have emerged in the UK as a new policy tool. They are designed to link funding of particular social interventions with outcomes so that, in theory, only successful interventions receive such funding. Research undertaken by the Newcastle team has delivered new conceptual understandings of SIBs. Grant 1 funded much\-needed granular empirical research to examine the complex set of multi\-level interactions involved in establishing and operating a SIB. The fieldwork, conducted in 2015 and 2016, focused on a substantial SIB\-funded programme located in a northern English city, which was targeted to reach 11,000 beneficiaries with long\-term health problems over a seven\-year period. Social economy enterprises delivering the interventions funded by the SIB programme were paid on the basis of referral numbers and improved well\-being of beneficiaries. PUB1 identified multiple tensions at policy, management and service delivery levels during the establishment and operation of this SIB\-funded programme. It found that, while establishing the SIB financial mechanism may make sense at a macro policy level, there may be deleterious consequences for social economy enterprises at a micro level. The research highlighted the importance of ongoing contractual flexibility and trust so that the tensions of \(1\) managing a social intervention and \(2\) meeting contractual requirements can be reconciled. The research emphasised that such tensions are inevitable in any SIB mechanism and that future SIB design should anticipate and pre\-empt such operational hurdles. The identification of these issues was crucial to the understanding of SIB operations and led this paper to win the Bleddyn Davies Early Career Prize in 2020 for scholarship of the very highest standard by an early career academic in that journal. 

 **Research on Social Entrepreneurship in Chile** 

 The SIBs research described above co\-exists with a broader stream of research on the funding of entrepreneurship in emerging market contexts by Kimmitt \(e.g. PUB3\), and pioneering research on the social economy in Chile. The first significant study of the social entrepreneurship sector in Chile was funded by Grant 2. This large\-scale study was conducted in conjunction with Pablo Muñoz \(now Professor of Entrepreneurship at the University of Liverpool and Visiting Professor at the School of Economics and Business, Universidad del Desarrollo \(UDD\), Chile\). It comprised a survey of 584 social entrepreneurs, with a further 70 interviews. The resulting report \(PUB2\) identified key challenges for the social enterprise sector regarding investment, growth, impact measurement and collaboration. In particular, the study identified that the underperformance and lack of growth in the sector were explained at the micro level by minimal social impact measurement tools and lack of collaborative cultures. Drawing from the study’s unique data set, PUB5 identified that business development is dependent on a social entrepreneur’s capacity to measure their social impact, which improves their ability to compete and attract necessary investment. The high quality of this scholarship was recognised with the Thomson Reuters Best Paper Award at the Global Innovation and Knowledge Academy conference in 2018. Also at a micro level, Kimmitt’s research has explored the importance of community collaboration as a key feature of how entrepreneurs understand the true complexity of their environments \(PUB4\). 

 At a macro level, Kimmitt’s research \(PUB3\) has established the importance of an enabling political context to allow entrepreneurs to invest and encourage financiers to allocate funding. PUB6, linked to a major policy report for relevant Chilean stakeholders authored by Kimmitt and Muñoz, identified key challenges for the growth and financing of social enterprises, including the value of social impact assessment for these entrepreneurs \(Grant 3\). PUB6 developed a framework with and for policymakers to assess and prioritize social issues and target groups in the design of a SIB, guiding policy decisions regarding investment allocation to social economy organizations. In sum, the two strands of research comprise a substantial body of work which forms the evidential and conceptual basis for impact on policy and social entrepreneurs in Chile.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The significant impact that Newcastle research has had on the Chilean social economy has been enabled by extensive engagement with Chilean policymakers, social entrepreneurs and incubators. The Chilean social economy is relatively underdeveloped, and the potential and challenges for the sector were largely unknown prior to Kimmitt and Muñoz’s research \(PUB2\) in 2016. Targeted dissemination activities of this research and Newcastle’s SIB research were the initial trigger for significant and far\-reaching impact, both in high\-level Chilean government policy adoption and implementation relating to SIBs and Social Entrepreneurship, and ‘on the ground’ amongst entrepreneurs and incubator managers. 

 **1a. Initiating SIB Policy Change** 

 In 2016, a series of public seminars, workshops and media appearances were organised by Kimmitt in conjunction with colleagues from Universidad del Desarrollo and CORFO, to stimulate policy debate and initiate policy\-level discussions amongst social entrepreneurs, investors and policymakers regarding investment in Chile’s social economy and its key challenges. A senior advisor to presidential candidate Sebastián Piñera and former Vice President of the Chilean Enterprise Development Agency \(CORFO\) saw Kimmitt present the findings of the UK SIB research \(PUB1\); this led to the adoption and implementation of a new policy initiative in Chile.  The key recommendation that Kimmitt presented was the potential facilitating role of SIBs in developing the investment market in Chile’s social economy. As a direct result, the incoming Chilean government committed, in their 2017 election manifesto, to spending USD50,000,000 \(October 2017\) on SIBs \[IMP1\]. This represented the most significant public policy commitment to SIBs from any emerging\-economy government globally. A letter from the senior advisor states, *‘The government program of the current President of Chile, Mr Sebastian Piñera included SIBs in its manifesto as a new instrument for social policy to be implemented during his term … Certainly Dr Kimmitt’s aforementioned research contributed in trying this innovative tool’* \[IMP2\]. 

 **1b.** **Supporting SIB Policy Implementation** 

 Once the Piñera government came to power in 2018, the focus shifted to the development and implementation of SIBs within Chile’s social enterprise economy. CORFO, Chile’s principal economic development agency, was tasked to implement the programme. As a result of the research conducted by the Newcastle team in the UK \(PUB1\) and the Chilean social economy research \(PUB2\), CORFO commissioned Kimmitt and Muñoz to produce a report to support the implementation of the SIB policy. This was because, as the Director of Early Investment at CORFO writes in the foreword, ‘ *despite the relevance that SIBs have gained during the last few years, they are still perceived as a “black box”* … *this report comes during an inflexion point in Chile where it is critical to design better tools that lead us to a better future and a better society. How to achieve it? Through a set of policies and innovations that steer us to be more entrepreneurial and experimental in the way social challenges are solved. Thus, in order to unlock the “SIB effect”, more evidence is needed’* \[IMP3a\]. 

 Kimmitt and Muñoz, working alongside government officials, produced a ‘diagnostic tool’ \(subsequently documented in PUB6\) for SIBs in emerging economies. This tool, based on lessons from the UK SIB research, allows public\-sector organisations that commission SIBs to decide when a SIB model may be an appropriate investment vehicle and when it may cause more harm than good. This research has had a positive impact on the implementation of SIBs in Chile, as the following quotes from senior policy officials illustrate. One senior policymaker at the Ministry of Economy stated, ‘ *The \[diagnostic\] tool was useful. We used it as \[a\] baseline to learn how to evaluate social impact contracts, to see which ones are feasible and which ones aren’t*’ \[IMP4\]. In the Ministry of Social Development, the Head of Public\-Private Cooperation stated that the tool helped them to diagnose the potential for SIBs, and that they used its dimensions for further evaluations of such projects. He stated, ‘ *It \[the diagnostic framework\] is a model, a structure for others, it’s useful to visualize and see the concept, the idea of a social impact contract and to check whether \[a\] certain idea can be converted into a SIB or not. That was excellent ... It \[the diagnostic tool\] gives you some dimensions and based on that one, we built our own that we use … in every stage of development. You need to do that in order to move on to the next stage because we’ve realized that it’s a lot of work, right. Every stage, coordination and work between the ministries, legal aspects, etc*.’ \[IMP4\]. 

 **2a. Improving Social Entrepreneurship Policy** 

 The 2016 report \(PUB2\) proposed that social entrepreneurs in Chile should focus on improving their social impact measurement techniques and approaches to investment through collaboration. These recommendations had been disseminated by Kimmitt and Muñoz through public seminars and workshops in 2016, and a series of public seminars and media appearances in 2017 and 2018, to engender further policy debate around the findings. CORFO’s Director of Early Investment explains how the research came to influence social entrepreneurship policy in Chile: ‘ *Because social entrepreneurship has gained such traction in Chile in recent years, evidence of industry trends, needs and challenges was needed to improve our decision making in this area. The findings from the report emphasise two interrelated issues: \(1\) the measurement of impact and understanding of social issues and \(2\) investment needs and readiness of entrepreneurs. Dr Kimmitt’s published research has provided the empirical basis for understanding these issues’* \[IMP3b\]. 

 This improved understanding prompted a significant decision by CORFO to redesign their social innovation seed funding \(‘SSAF\-Social’\) programme \(SSAF\). SSAF was launched in 2015; by November 2020, it had supported 178 social entrepreneurship projects administered through incubator programmes, investing approximately GBP3,000,000. SSAF was modified and relaunched in October 2018 to focus on impact measurement, as recommended by Kimmitt and Muñoz’s research. CORFO’s Director of Early Investment states that ‘ *Dr Kimmitt’s research has helped to foreground debates around social entrepreneurship in Chile. Consequently, the findings from this research have been instrumental in the redesign of our funding programme for social entrepreneurs: the Seed Subsidy for Social Innovation Enterprises \(SSAF\-Social\). Based on this research, we decided to change the basis of our legal documents that applicants must satisfy to be eligible to apply and progress through. This was strategic’* \[IMP3b\]. Based on Kimmitt’s research, SSAF now has specific focuses on social impact measurement tools and collaborative approaches. Firstly, incubators train social entrepreneurs to develop impact assessment methodologies to an international standard, due to Kimmitt’s research emphasising the importance of this for being able to compete and attract necessary investment \(PUB 5\). Secondly, entrepreneurs are required to work with a ‘co\-executor’ to help develop their ventures, as the research suggests that this allows them to understand the complexity of their operating environment \(PUB4\). The changes to the legal documents detailed above by CORFO’s Director of Early Investment are evidence of the impact of the research. He also reports that ‘ *We have seen that the entrepreneurs, the business incubators and managers are very happy with these changes. They feel there is institutional support and we have encouraged the whole ecosystem to follow this*’ \[IMP3b\]. 

 **2b. Directly impacting social entrepreneurs’ ventures and incubators’ practices** 

 This change to SSAF has also had a significant positive impact on social entrepreneurs and incubator managers. Evidence from follow\-up interviews conducted between May and July 2020 highlights that social entrepreneurs have learned about social impact measurement tools, which has improved organisational planning. As one social entrepreneur notes: ‘ *Well, the project is at an early stage yet but I believe that the most important difference is that developing impact assessment tools has provided us with a roadmap. I believe that they are going to be useful in all of the aspects you mentioned and also when planning daily management of our organization’* \[Entrepreneur A, IMP5, p. 1–2\]. 

 Overwhelmingly, participants in the fund felt that a focus on impact assessment led them to consider aspects of the business that were critical, but to which they had not previously been able to devote much attention: ‘A *fter we participated in CORFO and COLAB \[the incubator\], and with all the workshops that have taken place, etc., we have incorporated new methodologies that have helped us to assess some things that we have never assessed before. It has helped us to conceptualize ideas and to assess other things’* \[Entrepreneur B, IMP5, p. 8\]. 

 Another entrepreneur noted: *‘to me it was like opening my eyes. I love using these tools, it gives you a wider perspective of the impact on the community, the context. For example … We went to the workshop and they made us create a value chain, the different areas of your business and think about how we could measure social impact’* \[Entrepreneur C, IMP5, p. 18\]. 

 Although the impact measurement workshops were important for developing the entrepreneurs’ understanding of social impact measurement, they were also vital for allowing them to be more competitive in their market: ‘ *To be honest… \[we\] did not carry out impact assessment \[beforehand\]. We were part of those organizations that hold workshops and used a satisfaction survey at the end. And that was all … The impact assessment was null. Now, it is a factor that helps us to distinguish ourselves from others, that is, other organizations’* \[Entrepreneur D, IMP5, p. 22–23\]. 

 The funding’s focus on social impact assessment was also an interesting learning experience for the incubator organizations, which had not placed much emphasis on this area in prior work they had done for CORFO. Incubators felt that it helped them to understand the industry much more: ‘ *We didn’t take it \[social impact measurement\] into account \[before\] … But thanks to CORFO and this initiative to strengthen this idea, for us, as Incubator, it was valuable. We began working on a new methodology and thanks to CORFO, the SSAF, the consultant, this coworking with the entrepreneurs, it was useful to understand and to explain the importance of this area in a social project’* \[Incubator A, IMP5, p. 30\] 

 **In summary**, research at Newcastle University has had a significant impact on socio\-economic policy in Chile, by \(1a\) initiating SIB policy adoption and \(1b\) supporting implementation of SIB policy, whilst instigating efforts to improve \(2a\) social entrepreneurship policy and \(2b\) the impact assessment efforts of social entrepreneurs. This high\-quality research has formed the basis for relevant and timely policy interventions that have led to far\-reaching positive changes in the Chilean social economy.

topic we find research that supports and informs business, entrepreneurialism, management as well as research informing public and private investments often for regional growth and development as well as policies aimed at improving productivity and firm growth in various forms. Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research. Several projects are also concerned with sustainable practices in business and entrepreneurialism for a greener economy and with enabling more socially responsible corporate practices.",2.41,26.85,43.9,35.51,39.13,30.4,32,6,214,84,97,20,514,196,43,7,0.2,0.0948583662714097,0.0273809523809523,0.140429409300377,0.0183080808080808,0.1161897845262508,1730

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In the UK, cancer will affect 1 in 2 people during their life. Delays in diagnosis are common and shorten lives. 

 Exeter research has identified and quantified the risk for each symptom or symptom combination of 13 of the main cancers. This research has **informed national policy, underpinning 89 of the 210 recommendations** in the 2015 NICE guidelines for recognition of suspected cancer, governing \~£1bn of annual NHS spending. The risk algorithms have also been incorporated into the three main UK GP software systems, therefore **improving the care of over 50 million registered patients**. Implementation of this guideline has **speeded up cancer diagnosis** by a week averaged across all cancers, with an estimated 6,000 fewer diagnosed as an emergency per year, an estimated 10,000 **more diagnosed with potentially curable cancer stages per year**, and associated improvements in cancer survival.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The vast majority of people with undiagnosed cancer present to their GP in primary care with their symptoms. Yet, until 2005 most research to understand how symptoms are associated with risk of having cancer were based on hospital data \- when symptoms were generally more overt, and the disease more advanced and less treatable.  As a result, referrals for suspected cancer from primary care were often poorly informed: many patients at low risk were being tested, whilst others at high risk were missing out on referral for testing. 

 The key problem with identifying people with cancer in primary care is that the symptoms of many cancers are common to many other benign conditions which GPs regularly see \(e.g. back pain, abdominal pain\).  Therefore, ideally, a statistical approach is required which can identify combinations of symptoms that are more indicative of cancer. 

 **2.1 Identifying and quantifying cancer risk from large clinical datasets** 

 Although the basic methodology for determining cancer risk from routine primary care data was developed by Hamilton while at Bristol University \(2002 to 2009\), it was only after joining the University of Exeter in 2010 that the work was significantly advanced using large national datasets of electronic records and applied to a larger range of cancer types. This work was underpinned by two large Exeter\-led grants: NIHR\-funded Discovery Programme \(DISCO\) \(£2m: Hamilton, principal investigator, 2010 to 2015\) and the Department of Health\-funded Policy Research Unit in Cancer \(£7.5m: Hamilton: co\-investigator, 2011 to 2018\). A more recent CRUK project grant has explored the impact of NICE guidance on times to diagnosis \(£148,000, Hamilton and Spencer co\-principal investigators, 2016\-18\). 

 This large programme of research by Hamilton and the DISCO team has developed risk assessment tools for 13 more cancer sites: pancreas, oesophagus, stomach, bladder, kidney, cervix, breast, uterus, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, non\-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, myeloma, leukaemia and larynx **\[3.1\-3.3\]**. These Exeter studies used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink \(CPRD\), which holds high quality information on over 11 million general practice patients \(around 5 million of these records being currently active patients\). The data is provided as anonymised copies of primary care records. Additional studies on brain cancer and childhood cancer were also published. These cancer sites total around 86% of the 359,000 new cancer diagnoses in the UK annually. 

 Each study analysed primary care records \(collected prospectively but analysed retrospectively\) using a case–control methodology, but adapted to the specifics of each cancer site. Each study identified which symptoms, physical examination findings or primary care test results were associated with a subsequent diagnosis of the cancer of interest, using conditional logistic regression **\[3.4\]**. 

 **2.2 Presenting the findings so clinicians and patients can use them** 

 The findings were presented as absolute percentage chances of an underlying cancer rather than relative risks.  Absolute risks are much easier to understand, for both clinicians and patients. Furthermore, as additional symptoms generally adjust the risk from single symptoms, the team chose to present both risks from single and from paired symptoms, graphically. 

 The Risk Assessment Tools \(RATs\) developed by Hamilton’s team are colour\-coded charts, with red shading representing risks of cancer above 5%, orange 2\-4.9%, yellow 1\-1.9%, and white below 1%. These thresholds for recommended investigation were based on research into patient preferences for further investigation **\[3.5\]**. 

 Figure: Positive predictive values \(in %\) for *laryngeal cancer* features in patients 60 years or older, for single and paired features 



 **2.3 Using features which may represent one of several cancers** 

 The previous paragraph described research on single cancer sites. A concurrent research theme investigated features of cancer which are common across several cancer sites, such as weight loss, raised platelet counts, low blood albumin, and raised blood calcium **\[3.6\]**. Each study was published in a peer\-reviewed journal with high GP readership. 

 These less site\-specific features of cancer, estimated to occur as an early symptom in up to 30% of patients with cancer, are more difficult diagnostically in part because selection of the optimum investigation strategy is hard.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The UK has come bottom in most European studies of cancer survival for decades, with much of the problem ascribed to diagnostic delays. In a statement publication from the National Cancer Director in 2009, it was estimated that 5,000 lives are lost annually in the UK from cancer when compared with average European survival rates **\[5.1\]**. The contribution of diagnostic delay to this is explicitly recognised in the 2019 NHS Long Term Plan, which specifically targets an improvement in stage of cancer at diagnosis. The target is to increase the percentage of patients diagnosed at stage 1 or 2 cancer from the current 53% to 75%, which if achieved could avert more than 5,000 estimated untimely cancer deaths. Modelling studies suggest that every week’s delay in referral for cancer diagnosis worsens survival by approximately 1% \(Sud et al 2020, Lancet Oncology, 21\(8\), 1035\-44\). 

 **4.1 Impacts on national policy** 

 Findings from the research carried out by Hamilton and his team have directly informed the revised NICE cancer guidelines, NG12: *Suspected cancer, recognition and referral* \(2015\) **\[5.2\]**, with Hamilton also being the clinical lead of the Guideline Development Group. Eleven publications from Hamilton’s research team in Exeter contributed evidence for 89 of the 210 recommendations. Seven of these publications were sole evidence for 41 of the 210 recommendations. These 2015 NICE guidelines also used evidence from research carried out by Hamilton’s team **\[3.5\]** which showed strong public support for investigation of possible cancer even at low risk. The results of this research were highly influential in lowering the threshold of cancer risk that should trigger referral for suspected cancer in NG12, from 5% to 3% \(p.14 of **\[5.2\]\)**. 

 **Adoption of Risk Assessment Tools \(RATs\) by general practitioners in England** 

 Initially, the National Cancer Action Team disseminated RATs for four cancers to all 10,000 English general practices in mouse mat and desk easel form. Following this phase, from 2015 onwards, implementation was led by a combined *Department of Health*/ *Macmillan* initiative, which generated software for seven RATs \(lung, colorectal, ovarian, oesophagus, stomach, kidney and bladder\).This software has now been incorporated in the three main clinical records software and is therefore available for use by over 90% of general practices in the UK, covering more than 50 million registered patients; 36% of practices have at least one GP using it **\[5.3\].** Each time a new test result or reported symptom reports a person’s risk for cancer to be above 2%, an alert is generated. This reminds the GP to refine the risk after discussion with the patient, seeking other relevant information such as additional symptoms or abnormal blood tests. This may then lead to referral for specialist investigation. More recently, qualitative data from a survey has also shown that GPs are still broadly supportive of RATs and this is evidenced by a range of outcome measures which reflect the increased GP cancer diagnostic activity as a result of RATs. \[ **5.3\]** 

 **Improvements in cancer referral and diagnosis** 

 Since the introduction of the Exeter\-developed RATs, referrals from primary care for suspected cancer have increased along with the number of new cancer diagnoses, and a decreased proportion of cancers being diagnosed as an emergency. 

 a\) *Increased number of two\-week\-wait referrals*: 

 Two\-week wait referrals for suspected cancer have increased significantly from 1.5 million annually in 2013/14 to 2.3 million in 2019/20 **\[5.4\]**. There is now strong evidence which links increased two\-week referrals with better cancer survival **\[5.5\]**. This evidence cited Exeter research which showed the previous NICE guidance was associated with reduced times to diagnosis. 

 b\) *Increased proportion of cancers diagnosed using the two\-week\-wait referral:* 

 From 2013/14 to 2019/20 the proportion of cancers that were detected within the two\-week\-referral care pathway in England has increased from 47.4% to 53.7% **\[5.6\]**. 

 c\) *Decreased time between first symptom presentation of cancer to primary care and diagnosis \(the ‘diagnostic interval’\):* 

 This has been examined by comparing the diagnostic interval for cancer patients whose symptoms only met the criteria in the 2015 NICE guidelines \(i.e. the guidelines directly informed by Hamilton’s work\) against those whose symptoms met the previous referral criteria \(2005 NICE guidelines\). For several cancers the new symptoms were being diagnosed more rapidly than before **\[5.7\]**. On average, using the more specific, 2015 NICE referral guidelines, patients were found to be diagnosed seven days earlier following symptom presentation. A week matters in this patient group: the best current estimate is that survival worsens by 1% for each week that diagnosis is delayed. \(Sud et al 2020, Lancet Oncology, 21\(8\), 1035\-44\) 

 d\) *Decreased proportion of cancers diagnosed as an emergency*: 

 This has fallen from 20.2% to 18.8% between 2013 and 2018 **\[5.6\]**. It is probably the strongest marker of improved GP referral practices for suspected cancer and equates to 6,000 fewer emergency presentations with cancer per year. 

 e\) *Improved cancer stage at diagnosis*: 

 Stage 1 or 2 \(i.e., more curable\) cancer at diagnosis has risen from 47% to 51% between 2013 and 2018 **\[5.8\]**, equating to over 10,000 more potentially curable patients annually. 

 f\) *Increased cancer survival:* 

 The cumulative benefit of all the above improvements will inevitably be associated with better cancer survival for more patients.  While some of the improvements described above will have resulted from other NHS initiatives to improve cancer referral and treatment, most of these initiatives have worked in conjunction with having clearer guidance \(e.g. the NG12 NICE Guidance – **\[5.2\]**\) about which patients in primary care should be referred for specialist assessment – which is the main contribution of the Exeter research. 

 g\) *Establishment of ‘multi\-disciplinary diagnostic centres’:* 

 Our research has also shown that features of cancer which are common across several cancer sites \- such as raised platelet counts, low blood albumin, and raised blood calcium \- present a clinical opportunity for earlier diagnosis **\[3.6\]**. In response to this evidence the NHS has established ‘multi\-disciplinary diagnostic centres’ which use these features as entry criteria. In the NHS Long Term Plan \(2019\) **\[5.9\]**, these centres have been expanded into Rapid Diagnostic Centres across the whole of England, again using the features we have studied to underpin their entry criteria.  These Rapid Diagnostic Centres, have built on service models “ *which have focused on diagnosing cancers where patients often present with non\-specific symptoms and may go to their GP many times before being sent for tests*.” \(para. 3.59\)

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Northumbria University into competitiveness and productivity of small and medium\-sized enterprises \(SMEs\) identified the lack of specialised and ongoing support for businesses of this type. By filling the gap in provision for growth\-focused and accessible support for SMEs, Northumbria University’s Business Clinic \(NUBC\) has created a regional ‘entrepreneurial ecosystem’ through collaboration with key local stakeholders, such as the North East Chamber of Commerce and the North East Local Enterprise Partnership. Since 2013, 300 SMEs have benefited from the additional expertise worth GBP1,650,000. This has led to benefits including directly contributing to GBP50\-70,000 increase in productivity, 100% increases in sales, new products, advertising and marketing plans, creating new jobs, and providing capacity and expertise which would otherwise be unavailable. In order to improve accessibility to the service, NUBC launched the Digitally Enabled Business Clinic \(DEBC\) in 2018 that has so far helped 47 SMEs, delivering consultancy worth GBP243,178 and leading the UK Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy to support Northumbria’s research and toolkit to create digital business clinics nationwide.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Northumbria University’s Business School research investigating SMEs combined empirical and conceptual approaches to demonstrate that the barriers to growth and absence of advisory support were under\-examined challenges in these businesses \[ **R1**\- **R6**\]. SMEs are understood as those with fewer than 250 employees and turnover below approximately GBP40,000,000. Northumbria research using a case study format and semi\-structured interviews, demonstrated there was a gap in government\-provided advice and support between ‘start\-up’ businesses and large established enterprises \[ **R1**\]. This gap in provision contributes to SMEs being ‘time poor’ and lacking the resources and financial security to innovate, including 37% of SMEs having too few staff or lacking the skillset for innovation and 27% finding it too challenging having attempted innovation without support \[ **R2**\]. 

 The acquisition of external knowledge is of special value to SMEs, as due to their small size they tend to rely on the scope of the knowledge of the entrepreneur or SME owner \[ **R2**, **R3**\]. Northumbria research showed that the existing literature focused on long\-term collaborative relationships and the role of trust in these relationships \[ **R3**\]. However, intensive, targeted consultancies specific to individual business needs as valuable means of knowledge\- and skills\-transfer, are overlooked in the existing literature \[ **R3**\]. Intensive consultancies do not have the trust built on existing relationships or long\-term collaborations \[ **R3**\]. An empirical analysis of survey data collected from 293 SME owners was undertaken using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling and showed that SMEs may lack the resources to develop long\-term collaborations but be wary of trusting advice from short\-term consultancies \[ **R3**\]. Therefore, any reputational advantage that the advising body has through external endorsement or community\-prestige contributes to quickly establishing trust in the collaborative relationships and improves the transmission of knowledge and skills to the SME \[ **R2**, **R3**\]. 

 Northumbria University applied these findings and conducted further research into the needs and best methods of supporting SMEs through their Business Clinic \(NUBC\), established in September 2013 \[ **R1**, **R2**, **R4**, **R5**\]. This included 60 qualitative semi\-structured interviews conducted in two stages, with 30 clients of the Digitally Enabled Business Clinic \(DEBC\) \[ **R2**\]. As a result, NUBC switched from a pedagogic focus \(delivering direct real\-world experience and transferable skills for Business students\) to tailoring the support model to meet an emergent need of regional SMEs \[ **R1**\- **R4**\]. SMEs had been unaware of the support or viewed universities as intimidating or inaccessible to enterprises of their size \[ **R2**, **R5**\]. Through a multimedia targeted marketing campaign and working closely with regional organisations such as the *North East Local Enterprise Partnership, Santander,* and *North East Chamber of Commerce,* NUBC raised awareness among North East England SMEs that the University could offer this support \[ **R5**\]. NUBC offered a *pro bono*, intensive, and tailored consultancy service for SMEs who do not have the resources to develop their own skills or knowledge independently. 

 Alongside this embedded work with North East \(NE\) regional SMEs and organisations, Northumbria research identified that the literature lacked a theoretical foundation that addresses the development and change of entrepreneurial ecosystems over time. Taking an industry lifecycle perspective, researchers built a dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem lifecycle framework \[ **R6**\]. This research demonstrates how targeted, intensive interventions in ecosystem life cycles can deliver important knowledge and skills at key moments, fostering ‘intrapeneurship’ \(innovation within organisations\) and entrepreneurship and regional connectivity and support options boosting both SME productivity and economic growth \[ **R6**\]. 

 The benefits of flexible and cost\-effective methods of supporting SMEs were further demonstrated through Northumbria research funded by Innovate UK and the UK Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy to conduct a regional pilot delivering 47 consultancies with 60 two\-stage client interviews and qualitative client surveys \[ **G1**\]. This research showed that the provision of online consultancies and support could improve accessibility and increase support provision for SMEs \[ **R5**\]. In 2018 Northumbria University established the DEBC to further research, demonstrate, and provide this flexible means of support. Northumbria continues to deliver online advice and consultancy as a core competency of NUBC, to reach and support SMEs who lack means or opportunity to travel to access the clinic in person \[ **R5**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 SMEs constitute 99% of UK businesses and, as the research has shown, can depend on affordable, accessible, and reliable external support, knowledge, and skills to support the owner. SMEs in North East England are a vital source of employment and growth but suffer below average productivity compared with the rest of the UK, especially London and the South East, inhibiting regional growth and opportunity. Northumbria University research contributed to the NE becoming an entrepreneurial ecosystem which led to productivity\- and skills\-enhancements for SMEs in the North East of England through intensive consultancies via Northumbria University Business Clinic \(NUBC\) and the Digitally Enabled Business Clinic \(DEBC\). Northumbria further created a research\-informed report and a toolkit supported by UK Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy to establish digitally enabled business clinics to better reach SMEs nationwide. 

 **4.1 Enhancing the regional business environment** 

 NUBC research identified the importance of reputation\-enhancing with key regional bodies to promote trust and accessibility with local SMEs \[ **R2, R3**\]. Regional bodies and regional offices of national organisations supporting business, such as North East Chamber of Commerce and the North East Local Enterprise Partnership, have closely worked with NUBC and recommended Northumbria’s service to local SMEs. These regional organisations identified the value in increased access to research\-informed support, expertise, and skills provided by NUBC in helping regional SMEs innovate. 

 \[text removed for publication\] explains the ‘ *NUBC is accessible for businesses who have little access to this kind of support elsewhere… and provides a valuable asset which underpins the success of many SMEs in the North East*’ \[ **E1**\]. \[text removed for publication\] the region’s largest member organisation and representing over 3,000 businesses\) established ‘ *regular practice in* \[text removed for publication\] *to raise awareness and promote the use of the NUBC among SMEs*’ as a result of the service’s success \[ **E2**\]. In order to expand accessibility, NUBC reaches out to smaller regional business support organisations. \[text removed for publication\], a North East regional not\-for\-profit organisation supporting the growth \[text removed for publication\]and operated businesses, are ‘ *proud to work with regional institutions like the NUBC in promoting productivity*’ because the ‘ *specialised advice and dedicated support offered by the NUBC provides an invaluable service to the smaller and mid\-size businesses in the North East*’ \[ **E3**\]. 

 The NUBC also engaged with larger, national organisations on the regional level. \[text removed for publication\] a UK\-wide retail and commercial bank, prioritises supporting SMEs through their \[text removed for publication\] programme and have worked with the NUBC through their North East office. \[text removed for publication\]as ‘ *a regional leader in identifying the need for additional support for SMEs through their research*’ and offering ‘ *expert advice to SMEs that meet real regional needs \[and\] fostering the productivity of SMEs*’ \[ **E4**\]. \[text removed for publication\] recognises NUBC as a ‘ *key regional partner’* \[ **E4**\]. \[text removed for publication\] support and funding organisation for entrepreneurs, works in the North East with NUBC and promotes them to local business\-owners as ‘ *an important resource for growing business and entrepreneurs… and a real benefit in helping them improve productivity and growth*’ \[ **E5**\]. 

 The endorsement of regional bodies gives NUBS a reputational advantage in being able to quickly build trust, a key determinant in the efficacy of consultancies with SMEs and contributed to a greater awareness of business support options in the North East. These kinds of partnerships contributed to greater awareness among SMEs of the NUBS support and allowed SMEs to benefit from that support. 

 **4.2 Benefitting SMEs through supporting improved productivity and new marketing strategies and products** 

 Since September 2013 NUBC has provided *pro bono* consultancy to 300 clients worth an estimated GBP5,500 per client \(totalling GBP1,650,000\) \[ **E3**; **E6**, p8\]. 100% of clients confirmed the consultancy services guided their decision\-making \[ **E6**, p8\]. Individual examples from SMEs demonstrate the value of NUBC guidance. \[text removed for publication\], an award\-winning national distillery, has seen a ‘ *100% increase in sales*’ directly attributed to implementing ‘ *research\-informed recommendations… on the design of the bottle, labelling, and branding*’ \[ **E7**, p1\]. The Managing Director explains, *‘\[w\]e do not have the resources or expertise to devote towards these issues, so advice of this kind is invaluable… We never would have thought of this without the Business Clinic*’ \[ **E7**, p1\]. \[text removed for publication\], a small market garden company, explained the benefits of working with NUBC, saying *‘\[b\]efore we worked with the Business Clinic we were selling about GBP150 a week, less than GBP8,000 a year. Because of the Business Clinic’s advice and expertise they helped us begin Facebook advertising for the first time and we were able to reach a huge new customer base. Now sales through Facebook advertising alone are worth more than GBP20,000 to us\!*’ \[ **E7**, p3\]. 

 \[text removed for publication\] training provider with over 150 private, public sector, and third sector clients. In \[text removed for publication\] stated that as a result of NUBC advice they ‘ *market tested and have developed three new categories of our produc*t’ \[ **E7**, p4\]. Further, \[text removed for publication\] confirmed the advice and guidance they received from NUBC offering detailed additional information about ‘ *the education market for our specific product… has been worth about GBP50,000\-70,000 pay back within the year*’ \[ **E7**, p4\]. The guidance received from NUBC became the standard practice for project development and accessing NUBC advice became a part of their business development planning policy \[ **E7**, p3\]. 

 In some cases, NUBC’s consultancy led to the creation of new job roles. Work with \[text removed for publication\] insurance firm, prompted them to adopt a new online and national marketing plan for their charity division \[ **E7**, p8\-9\]. This new marketing plan has directly led to two new jobs \(2 FTE\), an enhanced online presence in search engines negating the need for paid placement of advertising on search engines \(saving GBP1,000 per month since June 2020\), a >300% increase in enquiries, but most importantly to a new bespoke insurance scheme. \[text removed for publication\] Director confirmed that NUBC ‘ *advice enabled a significant change to our service offering by helping us to create a bespoke insurance scheme which was launched in 2019*’ and now serves over 1,000 not\-for\-profit organisations across the UK \[ **E7**, p8\-9\]. 

 **4.3 Expanding the accessibility of consultancy support for SMEs digitally** 

 NUBC has been supported by GBP44,279 in funding through Innovate UK \(a UK\-wide public body driving productivity and economic growth from research\) and the UK Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) to roll out a network of DEBCs nationwide, to enable SMEs across the country to better access support, knowledge, and insights being generated at universities \[ **E8**, p1; **E9**, p13\]. As part of the Business Basics element of the Innovation Strategy, designed to improve productivity of SMEs \[ **E9**, p4\] BEIS and Innovate UK commissioned NUBC to write a ‘How To’ guide to implement this policy and ‘ *underpin the formation of DEBCs in other regions*’, published online in March 2020 \[ **E8**, section1 p1; see also **E6**\]. 

 Northumbria demonstrated the efficacy of digital support for SMEs through their own DEBC. In 2018\-2019 the DEBC worked with 47 SMEs, delivering consultancy worth GBP243,178 to participating SMEs, averaging GBP5,174 to participating clients \[ **E10**, p3\]. 85% of participants confirmed the collaboration had ‘ *contributed significantly to the knowledge and/or culture*’ of their company, with 91% implementing the recommendations made in their bespoke consultancy report from the DEBC \[ **E10**, p26\]. These implementations include eight new marketing strategies, three new service design offerings, and three business process innovations \[ **E10**, p3\]. Examples include a client deciding not to pursue growth into the pharmaceuticals market as he had been unaware of the labour\-intensive regulatory environment and, after DEBC advice, decided he did not have the skills or time to meet the demands: ‘ *a sort of one\-man band like myself would find it difficult, so that’s changed what I’m offering to customers and who I go after*’ \[ **E10**, p23\]. Other benefits to clients are illustrated by research\-informed advice on the value of purchasing space on a Chinese server to host a new website for greater penetration into the Chinese market: ‘ *just us in the office with our lack of experience, we probably would have just extended it and maybe offered a translation of what we have at the moment*’ \[ **E10**, p23\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Second World War \(WWII\) stands on the cusp of human memory. As those who had direct experience of it pass away, new challenges arise in the appreciation of the relevance or significance of WWII’s history and archaeology.  Historians at UEA responded to this dilemma with an educational and cultural programme intended to promote the East of England’s WWII social and military heritage. What might have been an exercise in nostalgia rapidly developed into a venture in social history, with diverse and far\-reaching benefits.  Supporting the education of adults and school children, stimulating local businesses, generating economic growth through the visitor economy, promoting wellbeing through occupational therapy, and improving museum resources not least through online media and its involvement in the development of a Tom Hanks mini\-series, our project has not only enhanced cultural heritage but permanently altered attitudes to the region’s past. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Liddiard is an internationally respected figure in the study of military landscapes and an acknowledged pioneer in the archaeology of twentieth\-century conflict zones.  Already renowned for his research on medieval castles and realising that more recent wars had bequeathed a built heritage just as significant but rather less well protected, he has increasingly turned his attention to the archaeology of WWII.  Working from within UEA’s Landscape Group, one of the leading research clusters on designed and built landscapes anywhere in the world, as Co\-Investigator in a  European Union InterReg IV venture on WWII Heritage \(2010−14, total value EUR4,216,110\) Liddiard collaborated with partners in the Netherlands, the UK, Belgium, and France, investigating and making more publicly accessible aspects of East Anglia’s WWII heritage.  From this sprang four guidebooks \(20,000 copies distributed to public and heritage outlets\), an award\-winning ‘Walberswick’ Project’ on the East coast anti\-invasion defences of WWII \(an REF2014 Impact Case Study\), two ground\-breaking articles published in 2012 \( **3.1**, **3.2**\), and a monograph by Liddiard and David Sims, *A Very Dangerous Locality: the Landscape of the Suffolk Sandlings in the Second World War* \( **3.3**\). This book was winner of the History section of the 2019 East Anglian Book Awards and described in *Rural History* \(2019\) as *‘a wonderful book … brilliantly combining archival research with field survey’*. 

 East Anglia has particular significance in WWII heritage owing to the presence in the region from 1941−45 of the United States Eighth Air Force: one of the largest such formations ever assembled. While the history of this so\-called ‘Mighty Eighth’ and its contribution to the Allied Strategic Bomber Offensive is well known \(and widely celebrated in the USA, with its own museum in Savannah Georgia\), in eastern England it has left a substantial legacy, in local memory \(now rapidly fading\), in material and archaeological remains \(still too often neglected\), and culturally in a network of volunteer\-run museums. These museums have endeavoured to preserve what can be rescued.  However, they are generally dependent upon amateur enthusiasm, with the need for generational renewal of increasingly pressing concern. 

 In order to meet this challenge, Liddiard served as founding member of a project board and subsequently as academic lead to a Heritage Lottery funded community interest project: *The Eighth in the East*, 2013\-16, which received a grant of GBP575,000, of which GBP74,874 \( **3.6**\) was channelled through UEA, with Rowena Burgess, a social historian also from the Landscape Group, as fellow member of the project board. Centred on the American ‘friendly invasion’, the project’s aims were to promote education, to undertake a programme of archaeological survey and cataloguing, and to support the network of airfield site museums. *Eighth in the East* funded a 3\-year post for a Learning Officer \(Annie Sommazzi, and subsequently Andrew Farrell, both contracted via UEA, both now in permanent employment\) to develop and deliver schools programmes. Liddiard provided academic expertise on archival material, oral history, and archaeological remains.  Nine internships were funded \(again administered through UEA\), with recipients placed chiefly at airfield museums, tasked with cataloguing primary source materials, collecting and stewarding oral historical records, and with supporting community archaeology. Liddiard undertook training of volunteers and on\-site recording. The archival and material remains thus gathered were widely publicized through a variety of media, including academic publications by Derwin Gregory \(Liddiard’s PhD student 2011−15, thereafter temporary Lecturer at UEA, now permanent Lecturer at Bishop Grosseteste University\) \( **3.4**\), and a highly\-regarded project website  [8theast.org/](https://www.8theast.org/), providing guidance to local heritage, an online legacy exhibition of photographs, story boards, podcasts, and blogs. 

 All of this work was undertaken and recorded at a time crucial to the oral history of WWII, before memories of the American presence in 1940s East Anglia entirely fade away.  While the experiences of the American aircrew who flew from the region’s airfields are well\-documented and tend to frame our view of events, *Eighth in the East* chose instead to focus on the ‘hidden histories’ of the otherwise marginalised ground personnel, including African\-American servicemen, and the many East Anglian men and women with whom they interacted.  A region regarded before 1940 as relatively isolated, between 1941 and 1945 became home to many thousands of American servicemen and women, of diverse backgrounds.  The effect here was to generate romance, tragedy, and tension in more or less equal measure.  Of this the only remains still standing are those of airfields and civic/military defence systems.  This evidence can be combined with the oral or written reports of those who were there, many of these reports now most easily accessed through the East Anglian Film Archive, stored in the Norfolk Record Office under joint UEA/Record Office management: an essential partner in the project’s work.  So successful did *Eighth in the East* prove in uncovering neglected aspects of the region’s social and military heritage that it gave rise to a legacy project, headed by Gregory, loosely grouped under the title ‘HQ\-East’, with its own social media outlets and programme of archaeological excavation, tasked in 2017−18 to investigate ‘What the American’s Left Behind in East Anglia’ \(supported by grants totalling GBP34,000, equally split between the UEA ESRC Impact Accelerator Account and the UEA Higher Education Innovation Fund allocation\). Acknowledging the potential benefits of archaeology as occupational therapy, two excavations were conducted on the site of the former airfield at Thorpe Abbotts.  Previously unknown WWII archaeological remains were discovered, written up, and published by Gregory \( **3.5**\).

 **4. Details of the Impact** 

 Through a variety of projects and subsequent spin\-offs, we have sought to contextualize and raise awareness of the East of England’s military heritage.  In so doing, we have benefitted local society and the economy more broadly, recording, enhancing, and disseminating historical records, reaching out to the tourist industry and to other local businesses, and informing those now engaged in dramatizing historical reality. 

 **Volunteers, Citizen Archaeology, Education, and Occupational Therapy** 

 *Eighth in the East* directly engaged 15,969 people, with key beneficiaries involved in the educational programme, including theatrical performances, family days, and exhibitions \(5737 visitors\). Through Liddiard and UEA, a bespoke package of historical resources was developed and disseminated, alongside a programme of outreach, including museum displays, archaeological excavation, and memorial restoration. 375 schoolchildren took part \(far in excess of the project target of 150\), either through classroom/museum activities, or outreach projects \( **5.1**, pp.69, 86\). 

 For both educators and educated this was often a watershed moment in attitudes to history and heritage. The level of engagement amongst schoolchildren drew comment.  As one museum curator put it: *‘The standard of work … was as good as any professional touring exhibition that we've hosted’* \( **5.1**, p.86\). At participating museums, 60% reported an increase in the awareness of their existence, and 40% increased school visits and raised footfall from younger age groups \( **5.1**, p.42\). At Bottisham Museum it was the innovation that struck a chord: *‘No one had thought about an education programme, doing formal lesson plans … People had studied the 8USAAF but not really with a view to teaching it to kids’* \( **5.1**, p.90\). Educational material was also placed online and made accessible via the project website and the *Times Educational Supplement* sites \(at least 5,389 views and downloads, **5.2** and **5.1**, p.88\) **.**  Of the project’s nine interns, all rated the training they received as effective, reported improved self\-confidence, and that it had helped their future careers.  On a practical level, one commented that the experience *‘allowed me to put into practice the skills I’ve learnt at university’*, another that *‘the whole experience was valuable’* \( **5.1**, p.100\). All nine moved on to employment or full\-time postgraduate study. 

 In terms of training, *Eighth in the East* directly engaged 120 volunteers to conduct archaeological surveys on 95 aviation sites \( **5.1**, p.52\), with 72% reporting that they had acquired new skills, 50% that they had subsequently used these skills elsewhere, and 97% rating their training ‘effective’ or better \( **5.1**, p.58\). Supplying local archaeology groups with the expertise with which to secure their futures, Liddiard’s training was cited here as especially decisive.  In the successor legacy project HQ\-East, occupational therapy was a central concern.  In two excavations at Thorpe Abbotts, in collaboration with the American Veterans Archaeological Recovery Programme, training was provided to 19 British and American serving and former members of the armed forces, as well as to family members. Military personnel undertook 462 volunteering hours, 98 of these hours with observation by Occupational Therapists \( **5.4**\). The benefits for those who took part were significant, one medically discharged veteran stating that she had not *‘smiled as much as she did on the excavation for a long time since her injury’*. Another participant reported that *‘these injured soldiers have spent a lot of time feeling ignored and forgotten … and to have you \(Gregory\) acknowledge her thoughts ... really helped with her confidence’* \( **5.3a**\). The Occupational Therapist observers confirmed the transformative effects on well\-being, noting that those taking part found themselves not only using skills learned in the military for new purposes, but developing new capabilities, thanks in part to the *‘accepting and non\-judgemental environment’* \( **5.4, 5.5**\). 

 **Networking, Dissemination, and Service to Museums** 

 The museums also benefitted, not least through the recruitment of new and younger volunteers.  Thorpe Abbotts airfield museum, for example, reports an increased artefact collection, increased awareness, and significantly increased footfall \( **5.3a**\). Through the dissemination of its work, the project and its legacy organisations have become the centre of an expanding network of interest groups, acting as a connector and facilitator in ways not originally envisaged. Global reach is evidenced through social media. By July 2020 \( **5.6\)**, posts on the legacy project HQ\-East’s Twitter feed \(followed by 4,677 individuals located in 89 different countries\) had reached 6,048,685 people worldwide.  A further 1,290,359 were reached via Facebook \(1,126 followers\); whilst 17,322 individuals follow the Instagram account.  A survey of online viewers demonstrates the tangible benefits of this network, with 32% of respondents indicating that they have visited a regional museum as a result of their website use, and a further 44% reporting that the project had changed the way they think not only about the United States Army Air Forces \(USAAF\) in East Anglia but about twentieth\-century heritage sites more generally \( **5.6\)**.  This has brought further benefits to a range of national and regional organisations, not just in heritage but for the local economy. The internationally important American Air Museum \(a subsidiary of Imperial War Museum, Duxford, 2019 footfall 401,287, **5.6**\) uses the project’s site as a principal platform from which to share its collections with the public \( **5.3c\)**.  As reported by the American Air Museum’s Web Engagement Officer, without its own social media accounts, the Museum depends upon Liddiard and Gregory’s site as *‘the way its \(29,000\+\) photos are shared regularly with target audiences around the world’*.  In turn, this has led *‘to corrections and improvements to the Imperial War Museum’s catalogue records’* \( **5.3c\)**. 

 **Local Business, the Visitor Economy, and Advice to Media** 

 As a hub for a range of interest groups, our various projects have promoted historic tourism and facilitated the creation of business networks.  In 2018, we hosted a corporate and educational event at Norwich Airport attended by representatives of 30 local businesses and enlivened by cockpit tours of one of the few still airworthy Spitfires \(MH434, built in 1943\).  Described by Barclays Bank as *‘an exceptional event’* impossible without the project’s support, this brought Barclays *‘new business opportunities in the aviation and technology sectors’* \( **5.7a**\), not least with SaxonAir Charter, whose letter \( **5.7b**\) notes the event’s *‘superb’* organisation, and the unprecedented opportunities arising here for networking and new contacts.  As a result of such enterprise, the not\-for\-profit business\-led private company Visit East of England developed a ‘Friendly Invasion’ tourist package. This resulted in the award of GBP237,000 from the Discover England Fund, towards a GBP387,000 ‘Friendly Invasion’ campaign. By 2019, this campaign was able to estimate a likely future uplift of 40% in US visitors, and the development of high and medium cost tour packages *‘of a kind that had never sold before’* \( **5.8**\). On average, each American tourist spends GBP930 per visit to the UK, excluding flights \( **5.9**\), suggesting a significant boost to the visitor economy. It also brought our project into direct conjunction with what in due course will become an Apple TV Plus miniseries, ‘Masters of the Air’, intended as a third part to the Tom Hanks/Stephen Spielberg WWII series, ‘Band of Brothers’ and ‘The Pacific’.  Gregory was closely involved in discussions here, including presentations of his research to executives from Playtone \(Tom Hanks’ production company\), to the scriptwriter, and to the author of the underpinning narrative \(Don Miller\).  Five thousand copies of a publication produced by Visit East of England, drawing upon our project’s research, with a foreword by the Duke of Cambridge and Tom Hanks, were freely distributed to museums in the US, including the National WWII Museum in New Orleans and the National Mighty Eighth Museum in Savannah Georgia \( **5.8**\), and Tom Hanks is reported to have *‘turned his office into what looks like an Eighth Air Force museum, complete with model airplanes hanging from the ceiling’* \( **5.10\)**.  Planned outcomes have been seriously affected by COVID\-19 with filming, originally scheduled to begin in 2020, twice postponed.  In due course, nonetheless, the heritage central to Liddiard and Gregory’s work is to be broadcast internationally to an audience far larger than anything imaginable when our project was first conceived. 

 With or without Hollywood glitz, our project has benefitted a range of audiences in diverse ways.  In the words of the independent evaluation report for *Eighth in the East*, it has *‘made an extremely positive difference to this history and the people of the East of England \(and beyond\) through training and education, participation and engagement’* \( **5.1**, p.3\).  Inspiring, training, and informing a future generation of enthusiasts, it has helped preserve the memory of an extraordinary socio\-historical phenomenon not just in terms of written or recorded testimony but as a built environment.  In due course, such landscapes may seem to future generations as significant and as iconic as the medieval castle or the once similarly neglected monuments of the Industrial Age.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Paisey’s research seeks to understand what it means to be an accounting professional at a time of increased public scrutiny and higher ethical expectations. Evidence based upon her research has \(i\) informed revisions to an International Educational Standard and a resultant policy shift to ensure that the Continuing Professional Development of almost 3 million accountants worldwide legitimises the profession’s claim to serve the public interest. Through engagement with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland \(ICAS\), Paisey’s research has \(ii\) underpinned changes to ICAS policy and practice via bold new ethics guidance for its 23,000 members, which supports speaking up and whistleblowing. In turn, this has \(iii\) influenced the wider business community \(e.g. by informing ethics policy within PwC, the UK’s largest professional services firm\). These constitute significant impacts on ethical culture and maintaining public trust.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **2.1. Context** 

 Historically, professional accountancy bodies have stressed competence, ethical practices and serving the public interest as constituents of their professional status. However, the financial scandals of the early twenty\-first century resulted in widespread mistrust of the profession. Paisey’s research has investigated the responses of professional accountancy bodies to serving the public interest through enhanced Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) and processes to ensure that they remain appropriately skilled and grounded in an ethical culture in which member integrity is seen to transcend all other business objectives. 

 **2.2. Education research** 

 Paisey’s research into the development of the accounting professional **\[3.1, 3.2\]** has a key focus on education at all stages from school, through university, to initial professional development and CPD. Having identified a gap in the CPD literature, she has published in this area since 1996, most recently publishing two outputs with N. Paisey \(Emeritus Professor, Heriot\-Watt University\) **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. Based upon an analysis of the CPD policies of twelve professional accountancy bodies, a key finding is the need for accounting CPD to relate to all accountants who are members of professional bodies. While medicine and law have clear definitions of a professional practitioner and the scope of professional work, the accountancy profession lacks such a precise definition. Thus professional accountancy bodies retain many members whose current work is diverse and not necessarily related to accountancy, even if defined broadly. 

 A key concern identified is that some influential professional bodies only require CPD to relate to their members’ current roles, rather than to accountancy itself. This results in professionally qualified members satisfying their requirement by undertaking CPD that develops competence in roles that may be devoid of accounting content. This is not the intention behind mandatory CPD, nor is it sufficient to assure the public interest claims on which the accountancy profession is based. On the other hand, making every member undertake narrowly defined CPD would result in many members undertaking CPD that is relevant to their profession but not to their role, which may not be acceptable to them. The research **\[3.3, 3.4\]** concludes that more effective CPD is therefore needed, including accounting rather than solely role\-related material, since if a professional accountant does not act competently in whatever capacity, that could reflect negatively on the profession and themselves, with consequences for wider society and the public. 

 **2.3. Ethics research** 

 Paisey’s research \(with N. Paisey and I. Tsalavoutas\) has focused on the ethical dilemmas faced by chartered accountants, including how they handle them and the support they receive. The first stage of the research **\[3.5\]** consisted of a review of academic literature on speaking up, listening up, and whistleblowing, ethics and organisational culture, followed by a questionnaire survey of Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland \(ICAS\) members building on the literature review. For the second stage **\[3.6\]**, 48 interviews were conducted, primarily with ICAS members, to gain a deeper understanding of interviewees’ real\-life ethical dilemmas and actions, and in particular their speak up, listen up and whistleblowing responses to those dilemmas. 

 The principal findings and insights from this research have been that while whistleblowing policies are commonplace in the larger firms, they are rare in smaller firms, pointing to a need for more widespread usage. The first monograph **\[3.5\]** also shows that younger members are less likely to claim to have encountered ethical dilemmas or to have spoken up. The second monograph **\[3.6\]** confirms the need for a more listening\-focused approach and shows that chartered accountants encounter very significant ethical dilemmas much more frequently than previous research had indicated. The report concludes that there is a need for more widespread use of speak up/whistleblowing policies and support for chartered accountants who face ethical dilemmas, including enhanced networking and ethical mentoring arrangements.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###   

 **4.1. Pathways to impact** 

 Paisey’s research into the accountancy profession has enhanced our understanding of the role of the profession at the beginning of the twenty\-first century. Through direct engagement with international organisations and standard\-setting boards, it has contributed directly to the worldwide restoration of public trust in the profession by shaping international education and ethics policies and practice, as outlined below: 

 **4.2. Impact on international education** 

 The International Federation of Accountants \(IFAC\) comprises more than 170 accountancy bodies in over 130 countries, representing almost 3 million accountants worldwide. Its purpose is to serve the public interest by enhancing the relevance, reputation, and value of the global accountancy profession. Paisey’s work has informed the work of two IFAC standard\-setting boards, the International Accounting Education Standards Board \(IAESB\) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants \(IESBA\). The IAESB established a range of International Accounting Standards in professional accounting education, including the mandating of CPD for all members of accountancy bodies that are members of IFAC since International Education Standard 7 \(IES7\) *Continuing Professional Development* became effective in 2006. All IFAC member bodies are obliged to adopt and implement these standards. 

 Paisey’s research underpinned a significant shift in policy in IES7 to ensure that CPD continues to legitimise the profession’s claim to serve the public interest. In August 2017, evidence from the research was submitted to the IAESB **\[5A\]**. It proposed changes to two aspects of the IES7 exposure draft: First, Paisey’s submission argued that accountants whose role was no longer within accounting should nevertheless be required, on the basis of the research findings, to undertake CPD related to the field of accounting. Second, Paisey questioned the focus on planned CPD, proposing that unplanned but relevant activities should also be included. 

 Paisey’s formal comments were discussed at IAESB meetings in November 2017 and April 2018. The minutes of the April meeting **\[5B\]** record a debate on the exposure draft wording to accord with Paisey’s first point. In July 2018, an Issues Paper recorded that: *“Based on respondent feedback \[…\] it is critical that IES7 \[revised\] make clear that IFAC member body responsibilities for CPD relate to the role of the professional accountant”*, rather than to non\-accounting roles \(p.7\-9\). This point was only made in the Paisey submission, thus the now finalised revised IES7 has been amended on the basis of Paisey’s evidence **\[5C\]**. Moreover, guidance to support the implementation of IES7 includes a discussion of the importance of unplanned as well as planned activities, a revision that aligns with Paisey’s second proposal **\[5D\]**. 

 These changes are significant in both geographical reach and regulatory depth as they ensure that the mandatory CPD of almost 3 million accountants worldwide will be undertaken in a manner that is acceptable to both individual members and to the wider profession. The IAESB Director of Skills and Assessment confirmed that: *“the new standard talks of the professional accountant, rather than the role in the accounting profession \[…\] It’s very clear now—and the explanatory material really sets out—that CPD is relevant to you as a professional accountant, regardless of the sector in which you work, regardless of the size of the organisation.”* She added: *“Individuals within professional accounting bodies will be able to better see why they need to do CPD, and take better ownership and responsibility, and therefore, the relevance because it’s there, will lead to enhanced quality of CPD being chosen”* **\[5E\]**. 

 **4.3. Impact on ICAS ethics policy and practice** 

 Paisey is a member of the Council and Ethics Board of ICAS, and through this engagement seeks to keep her research relevant to current concerns within the profession. ICAS is a professional body of more than 23,000 members and 3,000 students who work in over 100 countries around the world. The reports of Paisey’s research on the ethical experiences of chartered accountants, the dilemmas they face, and the support they would like to receive, were launched at events held by ICAS in London and Edinburgh in October 2019. The research findings were further disseminated to all ICAS members via an article in the monthly magazine *CA Today* **\[5F\]**, thus increasing member awareness of ethics dilemmas. 

 Paisey’s research is now underpinning the creation of new ICAS practitioner\-focused documents for its members under the *Power of One* motif. ICAS is currently drafting plans to implement one of the research report’s key recommendations relating to the need for a system of ethics mentoring to support members with ethical dilemmas. The ICAS CEO confirmed, *“the research has been extremely informative, insightful and useful to ICAS. It highlights the need for organisations to have appropriate mechanisms in place to encourage speak up and listen up procedures and the benefits that they can bring to organisational culture \[…\] the research has assisted ICAS to identify areas where greater attention and focus is required in order to better meet the needs of members and also to serve its public interest mandate.”* **\[5G\]**. As a direct result of the research and in order to assist its members, *“ICAS decided to further the offering by facilitating access for its members to advice provided by Protect”*. Other initiatives in progress in Autumn 2020, which directly stem from the research, include a focus on bullying via a webinar and associated guidance, and the establishment of an ethics mentoring facility to support members with ethical dilemmas **\[5G\]**. 

 The research has also supported ICAS submissions to two reviews. First, ICAS included Paisey’s research findings in its submission to the UK Financial Reporting Council’s consultation on revisions to the Corporate Governance Code. Second, in its comments on the Exposure Draft on the Role and Mindset Expected of Professional Accountants, issued by IESBA \(the international standard\-setting ethics board\), ICAS proposed that: *“to ensure a successful organisational culture, employees need to feel they can speak up about concerns without retribution, that their concerns are listened to, and, most importantly, are followed up”*. ICAS evidenced this by means of appending links to Paisey’s two monographs at the end of its submission **\[5H\]**. The need for this additional inclusion in the exposure draft was discussed at the December 2019 meeting **\[5I\]** and included in the marked\-up copy of the proposed exposure draft **\[5J\]**, which includes reference to protection for whistleblowers as part of the promotion of an ethical culture. The ICAS CEO confirmed: *“This assisted in ensuring that the IESBA Task Force in charge of this project considered the need for inclusion of a specific reference to whistleblowing in relation to possible new content on organisational culture”* **\[5G\]**. 

 **4.4. Impact on the wider international business community** 

 The findings and recommendations from Paisey’s research are also relevant to the wider business community. ICAS has sent the reports to various international bodies; for example, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants has uploaded links to the two reports on its  [website](https://www.ifac.org/knowledge-gateway/building-trust-ethics/discussion/when-do-you-speak-listen-whistleblow). The Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment \(CISI\) also believe that the results contain important messages for their members, and hence participated in the research monograph launch events with ICAS. In addition, the Head of Professional Standards at CISI invited Paisey to deliver a presentation in Cyprus in November 2019, writing that: *“while your research focused primarily on Chartered Accountants, I strongly feel that your findings \[…\] are relevant for all professionals – including those CISI members working within securities, investment, wealth and financial planning”* **\[5K\]**. 

 Other international organisations have found the research useful in clarifying or supporting their thinking, informing policy evaluation \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[5L\]**\). For instance, PwC is the largest professional services firm in the UK with revenues of GBP4.2bn in 2019 and approximately 25,000 employees. PwC’s Ethics Partner commented that: *“the information \[in the research monographs\] about the experience of the wider accounting profession was helpful in contextualising the reports we receive on our Speak Up facility”*. He confirmed that PwC had been reviewing its own in\-house Speak Up facility and wrote that the research findings were, *“helpful in considering the specifications of the new arrangements”* and added, *‘I particularly found the focus in the Report on “Listen Up” of interest and supportive of views emerging within PwC as to how best to handle whistleblowing in its widest sense’* **\[5L\]**. 

 **4.5. Beneficiaries** 

 Taken together, Paisey’s education and ethics research has highlighted issues that need to be addressed by the accountancy profession, professional firms and other organisations \(these practitioners are the primary beneficiaries of the research\). This has led to changes to professional services in order to provide a culture in which accountants \(and professionals in other sectors\) effectively maintain professional competence and feel able to speak up where they have concerns, both of which are necessary conditions for public trust and the protection of the public interest \(therefore, the public are secondary beneficiaries of this research\).

Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research from Durham University has made a positive impact on policy and practice addressing the global problem of childhood obesity. This research recommends that interventions should take a ‘whole systems approach’. These recommendations have been adopted as international \(by the WHO\), national and regional \(e.g. Ontario, Canada; Hunter New England and Victoria, Australia; North East, England\) public health policy. Using these recommendations, two interventions \(ToyBox, EPODE\) were developed and tested by Summerbell. These have been translated and rolled out across the world \(ToyBox, 17 countries; EPODE, 31 countries\) and experienced by an estimated 20,000,000 European children and 70,000,000 children globally. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Cochrane database is the leading journal and database of systematic reviews in healthcare. With support from the World Health Organisation \(WHO\), Summerbell co\-led a Cochrane review of interventions to prevent childhood obesity \(published 2011\) with Professor Elizabeth Waters, University of Melbourne \(R1\), and subsequently a number of updates of the review, including the 2019 update \(R2\).  The review was designed to determine the effectiveness of a range of interventions that included physical activity and diet components. This research was distinctive in synthesising the findings from decades of individual trial studies to derive a comprehensive, coherent and reliable understanding of ‘what works’ and ‘for whom’. 

 One of the key findings of Summerbell’s 2011 Cochrane review \(R1\) was that interventions which used a whole systems approach to tackle childhood obesity were more likely to reach children from low income families and less likely to generate inequalities. A whole systems approach includes a combination of intervention components targeted at different levels. These levels can simply be described as people, products, places and policy. The most common interventions at the time of the 2011 review targeted only the individual child level and aimed to make healthier choices easier by providing information or enabling choice. The review also found that the most promising strategies involved transformative co\-ordinated action across all levels, and capacity building activities. 

 The 2019 update to the review \(R2\) included 98 additional studies compared with the 2011 version, and it confirmed that the most effective interventions used a whole systems approach. The review was able to go further in its recommendations and stated that interventions which intervened at all levels of the system, rather than just targeting up stream \(e.g. policy\) or downstream \(e.g. educating children\), were more successful. 

 Building on the findings of the 2011 Cochrane review, Summerbell et al. were partners on a major European study called ToyBox that was funded by the European Commission. The ToyBox intervention aimed to prevent obesity in pre\-school children. Summerbell led a systematic review which identified effective behaviour change strategies which informed the development of the intervention \(R3\). The ToyBox intervention was tested, using a cluster randomised trial design, in a total of 6,290 preschoolers and their families across six European countries in 2012–2013. Summerbell led on the sampling strategy and analysis strategy for the trial, which allowed for the testing of intervention\-generated inequalities \(R4\). Summerbell et al. summarised the findings from the ToyBox study into evidence\-based recommendations for Local Authorities and non\-governmental organisations \(R5\). These recommendations included areas such as encouraging parental engagement and role modelling, use of rewards, normalising physical activity in schools, and limiting screen time. 

 Ensemble Prévenons l'Obésité Des Enfants' \(EPODE\) \(translated to English ‘Together Let’s Prevent Childhood Obesity’\) was a large\-scale, coordinated, capacity\-building approach for communities to implement effective and sustainable strategies to prevent childhood obesity. Using the findings of the 2011 Cochrane review, and working alongside academics from across Europe, Summerbell’s unique contribution to the EPODE methodology was to provide methodological expertise for the design features \(e.g. a whole systems approach\) and implementation factors \(e.g. ensuring the child perceived the intervention as ‘fun’\) to increase the reach of the intervention to low income families \(R6\). This approach supported the effective and sustainable impact of the intervention.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 According to the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) childhood obesity is reaching an alarming proportion posing serious challenges. It is estimated that approximately 40,000,000 children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2018 and over 340,000,000 children and adolescents aged 5\-19 were overweight or obese in 2016. Durham University’s research and development of the ‘Whole System Approach’, as advocated by Summerbell et al. through a Cochrane review \(R1\), and subsequently the ToyBox Intervention and EPODE, positively impacted global health policy, public health policy and the health of communities. 

####  **Impact on global health policy relating to childhood obesity** 

 Summerbell’s Cochrane Review of Interventions for reducing childhood obesity \(R1\) has underpinned four key global health policies and strategies within the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) aimed at reducing childhood obesity. 

 The WHO final report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity \(2016\) \(E1p2\) calls on governments, leadership and stakeholders to recognise their moral responsibility in acting on behalf of children to reduce obesity.  The report draws heavily on Summerbell et al.’s whole systems approach \(R1\) in its recommendations to ‘Provide guidance on and support for healthy diet, sleep and physical activity in early childhood to ensure children grow appropriately and develop healthy habits’ \(E1 p28\). Specifically, Summerbell’s et al.’s research \(R1\) is referenced as underpinning evidence for recommendations around selection of healthy foods, promoting physical activity within the daily routine, incorporating food education into the curriculum and providing clear guidance and support to caregivers.  Dr Chizuru Nishida, Head of the Safe, Healthy and Sustainable Diet Unit within the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety of the WHO reiterated the importance of a whole system approach for interventions in the prevention of childhood obesity, and that the Cochrane Review provided important input into the WHO’s final report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity.  Dr Nishida stated that as of February 2020 “ *Among the 172 WHO Member States … 122 have included strategies to address nutrition in schools and improve school food environment while 134 have included actions to promote healthy diet and prevent obesity”* \(E1 p70,71\). 

 Summerbell’s ToyBox intervention research \(R6\) was used by the WHO Regional Committee of Europe when producing the WHO European Food and Nutrition Action Plan 2015 \-2020 \(E2\). This Action Plan was produced after the Regional Committee of Europe adopted to take decisive steps to promote healthy diets to help address the alarming rates of obesity across the WHO European Region \(which consists of 53 European countries\).  The Action Plan was overwhelmingly supported by health ministers and representatives of the 53 European Countries \(E2\).  Joao Breda, Head of the WHO European Office for Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases and Programme Manager, Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity within the WHO Regional Office for Europe, states “ *These findings* \[ToyBox systematic Review\] *were fundamental to achieve one of the main pillars of the Action Plan which aims to Promote the gains of a healthy diet throughout the life\-course, especially for the most vulnerable groups. The Action Plan encouraged the Member States to include these recommendations in their country\-level food and nutrition policies, and explore mechanisms to ensure longer\-term sustainability and generalizability of interventions and initiatives”* \(E2 p42\).  The action plan calls for policies to be adopted to maintain a healthy bodyweight and as a result member states are able to tailor policy advice, develop practical tools and build a healthier Europe. 

 In 2017 the WHO produced ‘WHO Guideline: assessing and managing children at primary health\-care facilities to prevent overweight and obesity in the context of the double burden of malnutrition’ \(E3\).  Summerbell et al.’s Cochrane Review \(R1\) is an underpinning output used in the ‘summary of evidence’ section and contributes to the strength of evidence ratings for the guideline’s recommended interventions throughout. The guidance is intended to help all 194 Member States and their partners in their efforts to make evidence\-informed decisions on assessing and managing children at primary health\-care facilities, to prevent overweight and obesity in the context of the double burden of malnutrition. The guideline was created to offer support for a full spectrum of heath care providers with, for example, over 4,100 downloads between March 2020 and August 2020 \(E3 p90\). 

####  **Public health policy in the United Kingdom** 

 As part of the government’s health and social reform, Local Authorities were given the responsibility for public health as they are best placed to understand the needs of the community at a local level \(E4\).  The whole systems approach advocated by Summerbell et al. through her Cochrane review \(R1\), which was used in the EPODE model \(R6\), was formalised through the Whole Systems Obesity Programme outlined in the 2017 report from the Local Government Association, with Public Health England and the Association of Directors of Public Health: ‘Making Obesity Everyone’s business: A Whole system approach to obesity’, quoting the Director of Public Health from Essex County Council “ *the best option is a whole system approach based on the EPODE model*” \(E5\).  Specifically with regard to the North East region of England, Peter Kelly, Centre Director for Public Health England North East, stated that “ *The recommendations from Professor Summerbell’s Cochrane Review on the prevention of childhood obesity are now embedded in the plans to tackle childhood obesity in my own team in Public Health England and in many of the North East local authorities.  Working in a whole system approach and promoting a healthy environment are now common place approaches in the North East public health system – approaches that are based firmly and directly on Professor Summerbell’s work and recommendations.*” \(E5 p30\) 

 **ToyBox,** funded by the European Commission, aimed to prevent obesity in pre\-school \(aged 4\-6\) children using Summerbell’s research findings from her Cochrane review \(R1\). The ToyBox intervention focusses on changing the physical activity, sedentary, and dietary behaviours of young children. ToyBox was implemented in six European countries \(Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Spain and Poland\). In these countries, 309 kindergartens/children’s nurseries and 7,056 pre\-school children and their families participated in the interventions \(R4\) \(E6 p3\).  The results recognised that a whole system approach was a successful intervention which did not increase inequalities and, for some outcomes, worked better for children from low income families compared with children from less disadvantaged families. 

 Following completion of the research study, the ToyBox programme has remained popular and a website now provides free resources for parents and teachers. Requests for these resources and general information about the ToyBox intervention has been requested by public health officials in a number of countries across the world including Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Germany and Poland. In 2018, the ToyBox intervention was voted by the European Commissions, Joint Action CHRODIS, as one of the good practices in the health promotion and primary prevention of chronic diseases across Europe \(E6\).  The ToyBox initiative was also promoted in The Parliament Magazine \(EU\), which is used to inform policy makers across the EU landscape with over 80,000 European subscribers, in an article titled ‘Urgent Need for EU action to tackle Childhood Obesity’ \(E6 p8\). 

####  **Health of communities** 

 The **EPODE programme** \(R6\) uses the whole of community approach to promote healthy eating and physical activity behaviours and prevent childhood obesity. EPODE has been translated \(and renamed\) and rolled out across 28 countries throughout the world \(E7\). The impact of EPODE is demonstrated with some examples below: 

-  The Ajyal Salima Programme was initially rolled out in Lebanese schools where it reached around 40,000 public and private school\-children and continues to be popular. The programme has reached over 300 schools across the country so far, with more schools taking part in the program as time goes on. The programme has been rolled out in United Arab Emirates, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Palestine and Bahrain over the past eight years and has reached so far more than 90,000 children in the region \(E7\). 

-  Dr Tommy Visscher, the co\-chair of the EIN \(EPODE International Network\) Scientific Advisory Board, and chair of the Scientific Advisory Board Chair of JOGG \(the Dutch EPODE approach\), stated “ *Lessons learned by Prof. Summerbell’s work have led to healthier children and healthier environments and systems across our international community\-based childhood obesity prevention platform reaching of 20,000,000 Europeans and over 70,000,000 people globally. Lessons learned are presented at the EU Platform for nutrition and physical activity, and health policy has changed at national levels, impacting schools, day\-care centres, sports clubs, social welfare and health management institutions impacting babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, and their parents.*” \(E8\) 

-  Luke Wolfenden, the Program Manager of Hunter New England Population Health \(which is a government funded health service in Australia that provides a provision for obesity prevention services to 900,000 residents\) stated ‘ *The findings in Prof Summerbell’s Cochrane Review which describe and recommend a whole of community approach to the prevention of childhood obesity and decreasing inequalities has directly informed an obesity prevention service model in the Hunter New England Region that our surveillance data indicates is reducing the population prevalence of obesity in our community, benefiting over 150,000 children each year’* \(E8\) 

-  In 7 European countries children from low income families improved their healthy behaviours more than children from middle and high\-income families through tailored interventions decreasing health inequities, as part of the EPHE project \(EPODE for the Promotion of Health Equity\) \(E9\).

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Research from Sheffield Hallam University has influenced policy making, professional practice, and public and professional understanding of gambling\-related harm. Beneficiaries of this research include regulatory agencies in the UK, Asia, Australia and Europe. Banks and colleagues’ research informed the UK Gambling Commission's national strategy to reduce gambling harms and their threat assessment of crime problems pertaining to gambling. It has also motivated the Australian government to block access to illegal gambling websites. By giving voice to family members of individuals with gambling problems, Sheffield Hallam’s research has benefitted those experiencing gambling\-related harm, by evidencing the need for increased treatment and support. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Banks and colleagues have undertaken some of the first research to respond to the global expansion of gambling and the harm it has caused. The liberalisation, economic deregulation and normalisation of gambling that has occurred in many states and jurisdictions across the world has heightened both the range and the potency of gambling products and services available to citizens. Over the last decade, online gambling has been a key propellant of citizens’ gambling expenditure, industry profits and state taxation revenues, with UK citizens losing £5.3 billion gambling remotely in 2019 alone. In addition, the most recent figures released by the Gambling Commission suggest that there are in the region of 395,000 individuals with gambling problems in Britain and a further 1.8 million gamblers ‘at risk’ of developing a problem. Gambling\-related harm not only impacts individual gamblers, but extends to family members, friends and others in the community, with the typical problem gambler affecting, on average, six other people. This research has uncovered, examined and furthered understanding of the multitude of serious harms associated with the proliferation of opportunities to gamble, and informed policy, practice and criminal justice responses. Sheffield Hallam’s research can be divided into two distinct but interconnected areas of research. 

####  1. Gambling\-related crime 

 Research examining gambling\-related crime involved: a systematic review of international literature; an environmental scan of news media, textual and visual analyses of e\-gambling advertising; analysis of the records of player\-protection and standards organisations; an innovative 18\-month virtual ethnography of online gamblers; and interviews with gambling regulators. The research detailed the manifold actual, possible and probable interconnections between gambling and crime in the context of the increased availability of wagering activities across many regions of the world \[ **R1**\]. It demonstrated the ways in which gambling and crime are approached in practice by gamblers, regulatory agencies and gambling operators. Collectively, this work offered the first empirically driven assessment of the extent and nature of criminogenic harms that result from the proliferation of opportunities to gamble \[ **R1**\- **R5**\]. 

 The research demonstrated the challenges of regulating mixed modes of gambling in a digital era and how player protection processes can be advanced through technological, legal and social responses \[ **R2**, **R3**\]. It also highlighted how criminal justice policy makers and practitioners have been slow to respond to the crime and criminal justice implications of gambling, and how a public health response to gambling\-related harm necessitates the institution of awareness raising, screening and treatment within criminal justice settings \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. In addition, the research led to the development of a taxonomy of gambling\-related crime that enables regulators to identify and explore the extent, nature and organisational dynamics of sub\-types of gambling\-related offending, whilst identifying the actors and legislation that can be exercised in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of such crimes \[ **R4**\]. Sheffield Hallam’s research into betting shop robberies highlighted how they often take place at night when lone working is more likely to occur and typically involve violence or the threat of violence, and the use of a weapon \[ **R5**\]. It demonstrated that greater guardianship of betting shop premises, through an increase in the number of 'frontline' personnel, particularly at night, could help to reduce the risk to retail staff. 

####  2. Gambling\-related harm 

 Research on gambling\-related harm incorporated: the first UK survey of family members and friends affected by problem gambling, the first UK survey exploring gambling\-related family violence, and semi\-structured interviews with gamblers and family members. This work was funded by the Responsible Gambling Trust \(£28,883\), GambleAware \(£44,407\) and the British Academy \(£9,742\) and supported by a range of treatment and support providers including National Problem Gambling Clinic, Gamcare, Gordon Moody Association, Adfam, BetKnowmore, Citizens Advice and branches of Gamblers Anonymous/GamAnon. The principal purpose of this research \[R6\] was to be the first UK study to give voice to family members, friends and other loved ones of individuals with gambling problems \- in order to document their lived experience, with a view to shaping policy and best practice relating to the education, prevention and treatment of gambling\-related harm. Collectively, the research demonstrated the impact that problem gambling can have on families and friends, the strategies they employ to try to cope with a loved one's gambling problem, their help\-seeking behaviour, and the barriers to help\-seeking. The research identified two broad interconnected considerations for policy makers and practitioners. First, there is a need to raise societal and professional awareness and understanding of gambling and its impact on families. Second, family members identified a need for improved access to and availability of support for affected others.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research conducted across the assessment period had several key impacts, deepening public and professional understandings of, and responses to, gambling\-related harm, both nationally and internationally. This included contributing to policy and regulatory change, and increased help and support for individuals and families experiencing gambling\-related harm. 

####  1. Policy and Regulatory Responses to Gambling\-Related Harm Across International Jurisdictions 

 Sheffield Hallam’s research demonstrating the multitude harms experienced by families of individuals with gambling problems \[ **R6**\] has contributed, through Best's involvement, to the development of a framework for measuring gambling\-related harms in 2018, which is utilised in **the <ins>United Kingdom's</ins> first National Strategy to Reduce Gambling\-Related Harms** \[ **E1**\]. Banks was also invited in August 2019 by Great Britain's sole gambling regulator and gaming law supervisor, the Gambling Commission, to join a multi\-disciplinary expert academic panel to provide research evidence to support the delivery of the three\-year strategy \[ **E2**\]. As the Gambling Commission Chair William Moyes recognised in his keynote address at the launch of the strategy on 25 April 2019, the experiences of those affected by gambling *""have played a significant part in shaping this strategy""*, which outlines a partnership approach to delivering two strategic priority areas: prevention and education, and treatment and support. 

 The research \[ **R3**\] contributed to the development of a taxonomy for considering gambling\-related crime, through consultation with advisory agency Regulus Partners, working on behalf of the Gambling Commission. As well as helping the Gambling Commission to chart the area for the purpose of risk assessment, the taxonomy was used as a framework through which the Gambling Commission was able to compile an overview of gambling\-related crime in Great Britain \[ **E6**\]. The taxonomy was developed further by Banks, in partnership with Waugh \(Regulus Partners\), in order to enable jurisdictional comparability and information sharing between regulators in different locations across the world, with a view to addressing locally based offending and enhancing collaborative responses to international crime problems, such as money laundering, fraud, theft, extortion and match fixing. 

 In **Australia**, two Sheffield Hallam studies \[ **R1**, **R4**\] into online gambling were cited as part of the Australian government’s response to Recommendation 15 from the 2015 O’Farrell Review into Illegal Offshore Wagering, which proposed that state and territory governments, in conjunction with industry, should take steps to increase consumer awareness about the risks relating to personal finances and information that result from using prohibited online gambling services \[ **E3**\]. Our research was used in a 2017 research report commissioned by the **Australian government to illustrate how interactive gambling is not immune to criminal exploitation.** In response to the review, in 2019 the Morrison Government instituted several measures to protect Australian citizens, who spend $400 million annually at illegal offshore gambling websites, which are prohibited services under the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. By recognising the risks posed by illegal offshore gambling operators, for the first time, the Australian Communications and Media Authority was empowered to work in cooperation with Australian Internet Service Providers to block their websites. 

 **Malta** is second only to the UK in terms of the size of its online gambling market and Sheffield Hallam research has informed the regulation of 294 gaming companies who have been issued with 625 remote gaming licenses. The research has **informed criminal probity checks in the Malta Gaming Authority** \(MGA\) \[ **E4**\] through our ongoing work with the former Senior Executive Officer in the Criminal Probity Screening Department, who is now Head of the Sports Integrity Unit at the MGA. Sheffield Hallam studies \[ **R1**, **R2**, **R4**\] highlighted avenues for fraud and money laundering in online gambling, and limitations in regulatory measures. The MGA report that Banks’ monographs \[ **R1**, **R2**\] detail *“responses to illegal gambling, money laundering and fraud and theft at online gaming sites that are of practical use to researchers, industry and regulators.”* \[ **E4**\]. 

 Sheffield Hallam research was drawn upon by the **Asian Racing Federation’s \(ARA\) Anti\-Illegal Betting \(AIB\) Taskforce's examination of illegal betting in <ins>Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea**</ins>, to illustrate the direct and indirect costs illegal betting brings to societies. ARA's Due Diligence and Research Manager has outlined how this research has been employed to educate the AIB Taskforce \- as well as a host of stakeholders, including media, politicians and sporting governing bodies \- about threats to the integrity of sports betting and to inform their enforcement efforts. He highlighted how: *“We found… Gambling, Crime and Society* \[ **R1**\] *very useful in several instances to illustrate the direct and indirect costs illegal betting brings to societies.”* \[ **E5**\]. 

####  2. Increasing Support for Families and Friends Affected by Gambling\-Related Harm 

 The research into gambling\-related harm **gave voice to family members and other loved ones of individuals with gambling problems, whose views, opinions and experiences were absent from social policy debate.** This rare opportunity was highlighted by one research participant who noted that: *“I think, for me, this is the first time that I'm really talking about my personal experiences, so it's been useful for me… I want to contribute towards the change…towards what it is that you're doing that could hopefully create hope for other people, including myself.”* \[ **R6**\]. Preliminary findings from the study were presented at a Gambling and Families roundtable event \[ **E7**\], hosted by Adfam in November 2017, with a view to identifying the need for support for families experiencing gambling\-related harm. The research team provided empirical evidence to demonstrate that families experienced significant and sustained harm across multiple domains, as a consequence of gambling, and that current support \- whilst highly valued by service users \- was insufficient to meet demand and further funding was necessary. In 2018, Adfam, who supported the Families Living with Problem Gambling project, were awarded £180,000 grant for a three\-year period by GambleAware to extend their alcohol and drugs services to gambling, where previously none existed \- to support, educate and empower families and frontline workers. 

####  3. Influencing Public Understanding and Professional Discourse on Gambling\-Related Harm 

 Sheffield Hallam research \[ **R1**\- **R4**\] has contributed to the **recognition that UK gambling laws are not fit for a digital age, leading to a government review of the Gambling Act 2005**, launched on 8 December 2020 \[ **E8**\]. Evidence was submitted to the House of Lords Select Committee on the Social and Economic Impact of the Gambling Industry \(2019\) and Banks is quoted extensively in the report Gambling Harm \- Time for Action \(2020\), particularly around the risks of lone working in betting shops \[ **R5**\]. Banks is part of a group of UK academics who published an open letter in the British Medical Journal in July 2020 to the Secretaries of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and for Health and Social Care, urging them to introduce a statutory levy on gambling companies, to deliver reductions in gambling harms. Research findings \[ **R1**\- **R5**\] have also been submitted to the Howard League's Commission on Crime and Problem Gambling's call for evidence \(2019\) into the links between crime and problem gambling, and published in the report *Crime and Problem Gambling: A Research Landscape \- The Report of the Commission on Crime and Problem Gambling* \(2020\). 

 In addition, Banks was invited to join the International Gambling Think Tank, presenting at the 2017 meeting in Banff, Canada, on responsible online gambling \[ **E9**\]. Organised and coordinated by the Gambling and Addictions Research Centre at Auckland University of Technology, the Think Tank is an international network of researchers, policy makers, service providers and interested others, collaborating to advance understanding of gambling and to reduce gambling\-related harm. Sheffield Hallam research has also been translated into plain language summaries or 'rapid communications' by the Gambling Commission's partner, the Gambling Research Exchange Ontario, in order to communicate this work to policy makers, practitioners and other non\-academic audiences across the world \[ **E10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Richardson’s pioneering research into Gypsy and Traveller site provision has supported key initiatives resulting in increased accommodation, new approaches to unauthorised encampments and a more open public management debate on the provision of Gypsy and Traveller sites. Her research since 2004 has led to the building of new sites \(for example in Leicester, housing approximately 300 people\), and improved management of existing sites and has been central to new ideas on land\-use for temporary sites \(negotiated stopping\). Richardson’s work has provided an evidence\-base of need and a critical reframing of the planning and public policy debate nationally. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Community conflict over land\-use results in homelessness for marginalised minority ethnic groups, including for up to 300,000 Gypsy, Traveller and Roma people who live in the UK, with hundreds of Gypsy and Traveller families displaced annually, largely due to an insufficient supply of appropriate sites. Professor Richardson’s research has engaged with hundreds of Gypsy and Traveller residents on sites and hundreds of housing professionals and elected officials, across the UK. Richardson was the first to find that conflict mapping and negotiation approaches are necessary to navigate contentious planning debates and provide much needed accommodation. The distinctive contribution of her public management research has been the development of inclusive research methods for this marginalised group, provision of an evidence\-base of need, and a strategic understanding of the impact of negative discourse on planning debates. This case study focuses specifically on the benefits of a long\-term programme of co\-production research \[R1\] on housing, homelessness, identity and home \[R2\] focusing particularly on accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers \[R3–6\], undertaken at DMU and published since 2007. 

 Richardson’s body of research since 2004 has identified that negative political and public discourse about Gypsies, Travellers and Roma leads to a hostile environment within which to consider site delivery and management as part of local planning debates; and that this conflict needs to be negotiated. Her original Joseph Rowntree Foundation \(JRF\) funded study from 2005–2007 \[G1, R3\] found that conflict mapping was a key tool to navigate planning for Gypsy and Traveller sites, which were seen by local politicians and residents as contentious spaces. Professor Richardson has applied these findings in co\-production research for Gypsy Traveller Accommodation Assessments \(GTAAs\) in Somerset and Leicestershire \[G2, G3\] to provide the local planning authorities with information on the precise need for sites in their area. More recently, for example, her research published in 2014 \[R4\], examined conflict in public debate, including a particular episode of anti\-Roma discourse and the implications for national community cohesion. This was followed in 2017 \[R5\] by a further research article presenting analysis of how negative discourse creates liminal and marginalised spaces for Gypsy and Traveller sites, rather than places to call home. 

 In response to this undercurrent of hostility, Richardson continued her research to centralise Gypsy and Traveller voices in strategic discussions on planning for sites. In Leeds \[G4\] the focus was on asset\-based community development which found that negotiated stopping produced financial and social benefits. Housing providers seeking to provide more and better sites funded Richardson to undertake research on site management principles in Cornwall \[G5\] and in Devon \[G6\]. Richardson’s study found key barriers and facilitators to the inclusion of Gypsy and Traveller sites in wider housing development plans. 

 Building on the first \(JRF\) funded project \[G1, R3\] and on previous research to understand the power and limitations of co\-produced methods \[R1, Richardson was funded again by JRF to lead on co\-produced research \(GBP123,328\) in 2014–2016 \[G7, R6\] across 54 sites in the UK, including 122 Gypsy/​Traveller residents and 95 professionals, which provided evidence of accommodation need and recommendations for a renewed approach to planning, building and managing Gypsy and Traveller sites. The published report \[R6\] was launched at an event hosted by the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Gypsies, Travellers and Roma \(APPGGTR\) in December 2016. Following this, Richardson led research, with the organisation London Gypsies and Travellers, funded by the Greater London Authority \[G8\], to further explore her key finding on the need for a negotiated approach through the conflict debate on planning for sites, and examine the potential for a pan\-London approach to negotiated stopping for Gypsies and Travellers \[G8\]. Richardson has found that it is vital to provide sites – secure and affordable accommodation underpins people’s ability to ‘feel at home’ and this is at the heart of a more equal society \[G9\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 DMU research on Gypsy Traveller accommodation has achieved national impact through co\-produced, applied research with communities, plus engagement with policymakers and practitioners. Richardson has built and developed relationships with key influencers who are able to lever the research as evidence to drive change and a renewed approach to planning and managing sites. This has led both to more accommodation being built, and a pathway to improved local authority approaches to planning and managing sites \(for example G5 was a specific result of a local authority wanting the ‘ten ingredients’ from the JRF study \[G7\] applying to their own sites so that they could improve their planned approach \[C1\]\). 

 The impact from Richardson’s public management research is most evident in the communities in England for whom the research has direct relevance, and it also has national impact as noted by the co\-chairs of the APPGGTR: ‘Your research evidence, examples and recommendations have made it possible to scrutinise the impact of some of the legislation and policy which result in inequalities around Gypsy and Traveller accommodation’\[C2\]. This impact from Professor Richardson’s research is evident in five key areas of Gypsy and Traveller life: 

 **\(1\)** **INCREASED AND IMPROVED ACCOMMODATION PROVISION** 

 Richardson’s most recent JRF research findings \[G7, R6\] were used to lobby government and to plan and deliver Gypsy and Traveller sites. For example, in a consultation on the powers for dealing with unauthorised encampments, the professional body, the Chartered Institute of Housing \(CIH\), wrote to the Minister for Housing as part of the 2018 consultation on unauthorised encampments, citing five recommendations quoted from the report: ‘CIH would strongly recommend such an approach… We strongly believe that this is not only a more equitable way forward, but also one that will bring quicker results, help reduce conflicts and improve living and safety conditions for Gypsy and Traveller families’ \[C3\]. Richardson’s JRF \[G7, R6\] findings are included in detail in the House of Commons Briefing Note on Gypsies and Travellers \[C4\] for MPs to consider in their public\-policy decisions. DMU research has resulted in increased provision: ‘Even more significantly for us in Leicestershire, directly resulting from your research in the county, we have been able to deliver new sites \(77 pitches\) which are home to approximately 300 people who would otherwise not have had secure or sustainable accommodation’ \[C5\]. 

 **\(2\)** **NEW APPROACHES TO UNAUTHORISED ENCAMPMENTS** 

 Richardson’s research on unauthorised encampments in Leeds \[G4\] analysed the benefits of negotiated stopping. Following publication of the report, the Leeds Gypsy Traveller Exchange CEO said: ‘It is so refreshing to have a report which \(a\) teaches us something new and \(b\) is going to be incredibly useful in furthering our work to improve the quality of life for Gypsies and Travellers…. Strategically the report has been incredibly helpful in backing us up to highlight the things that we do already know, and will redouble our efforts to hold local authorities to account…’ \[C6\]. The findings from the studies \[G4, G7\] led, first, to a multi\-stakeholder workshop in November 2017 with the \(now\) London Deputy Mayor for housing, police, local authority professionals and the organisation London Gypsies and Travellers and, second, to a research project with London Gypsy Travellers, speaking with officers, elected members and Travellers in London council areas, to explore the potential for a pan\-London approach to negotiated stopping \[G8\]. The resulting report was debated in an APPGGTR Roundtable in November 2019 which published a roundtable summary report in February 2020 written by Richardson, leading to a parliamentary question on 12 March 2020 by Kate Green MP \(Co\-chair of the APPGGTR\) \[C2\]. The London Deputy Mayor wrote that ‘The findings from the research have enabled the Greater London Authority \(GLA\) to understand in more detail how a negotiated stopping approach might work in London and my team is working to identify next steps in this area, including how we might approach implementation of this approach on GLA\-owned land and options for promoting the sharing of best practice and joint working between local authorities’ \[C7\]. 

 **\(3\)** **MORE ROBUST EVIDENCE\-BASE TO INFORM PLANNING PRACTICES** 

 The Gypsy Traveller Accommodation Assessment \(GTAA\) research in Somerset, led by Richardson \[G2\] continues to influence planning practice, with the report held up as robust, and an example of best practice in the field. An independent planning consultant who works on applications across the country, reported that: ‘I have also used the Somerset GTAA as a benchmark by which to assess other GTAAs, in particular on the subject of community involvement. \[I\] would suggest that there has been considerable real\-world impact of this piece of work in addressing the inequalities faced by Gypsies and Travellers in Somerset’ \[C8\]. By working with the community, the research findings were rooted in a robust evidence base, and this has been the case in the Leicestershire research \[G5\], which built on the Somerset co\-production methodology, where the Head of the county Gypsy and Traveller Unit said: ‘\[The Leicestershire GTAA\] was successfully tested in a number of local plan examinations where the evidence\-base was found to be sound’ \[C5\]. 

 **\(4\)** **HIGHER QUALITY SITE MANAGEMENT** 

 As found in discussions with housing providers, as part of establishing a national housing providers’ advisory forum, there is only a small number of housing associations managing sites, with suggestions from some that it has traditionally been seen as ‘difficult’. This is starting to change, and the JRF \[G7\] study involved housing associations new to this field. The Chief Executive of Rooftop explained: ‘Your 2006 book \( *The Gypsy Debate*\) and more recent research for JRF \(2016\) has helped to inform and accelerate Rooftop’s current and future approach to both policy and practice…. From my interactions with others in the housing industry I can also say it appears to have had impact more broadly…. This has encouraged us to explore setting up a national advisory panel… on which we hope you will continue to influence and advise’ \[C9\]. Another beneficiary of Richardson’s research, Cornwall County Council, said her work had led to plans for site improvements: ‘The findings from Prof Richardson’s study for us here in Cornwall have framed a clearer understanding of working relationships and management practices for the council and the ALMO Cornwall Housing Ltd. This has resulted in plans for site improvements and better places to live for our Gypsies and Travellers’ \[C1\]. 

 **\(5\)** **INCLUDING GYPSIES AND TRAVELLERS IN RESEARCH** 

 Alongside influencing strategic and practical decisions, Richardson’s approach has created opportunities to amplify the voices of Travellers during the co\-production research process itself. The advocacy charity *One Voice* said: ‘Without your research Jo, we would not have the evidence we need for planning inquiries on site delivery, and we would not have voices from the community embedded so strongly throughout the research process to enable Gypsy Traveller people to feel the benefits of your work through the provision of more, and better managed, accommodation’ \[C10\]. The Head of the Multi\-Agency Gypsy Traveller Unit in Leicestershire said of the accommodation needs research \[G3\]: ‘…we knew that your co\-production methods would involve meaningful engagement with the communities and a robust evidence\-base of need’ \[C5\]. 

 There is international interest in Richardson’s research: for example, an invitation to deliver a keynote lecture for Harvard University’s Program on Negotiation \(12 May 2016\) on the basis of her emerging findings for the JRF \[G7\] study and her pivotal use of conflict resolution and negotiation framing of the debate dating back to the first JRF \[G1\] project.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Student actors with dyslexia experience significant challenges in reading, understanding and memorising Shakespearean text. Whitfield’s work has raised awareness of the challenges faced, but more importantly devised metacognitive strategies to support individuals. This has enabled dyslexic acting students to gain self\-confidence, take control of their learning, realise their potential and ultimately to progress into professional employment. In an area where there is little dissemination of pedagogical support, Whitfield has influenced other teachers to change their practice to accommodate those with dyslexia and other specific learning differences. Her innovative teaching strategies have been adopted by other teachers, influencing the efficacy of their teaching of text\-based work, where fluency, accuracy of word and self\-confidence are at the core.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Shakespearean performance often plays a central role in actor\-training syllabi, as it requires intellectual, physical and technical proficiency, which can significantly advance student learning. Learning support services in British drama training institutions have reported that some 10\-25% of acting students studying in drama schools are assessed as dyslexic \(2016\). Universities in the UK and the US also report similar numbers of dyslexic students in actor training departments \(2017\). These individuals experience substantial challenges in reading and understanding Shakespeare’s unfamiliar language. Whitfield found there was little discussion or published literature concerning support for such students who can experience considerable stress within traditional teaching approaches. Whitfield’s research investigated methods of working that accommodate preferred learning styles in accessing the content of the written text. 

 Whitfield adopted a case\-study approach integrated with action research, set within a constructivist\-interpretivist framework. Working with dyslexic acting students as co\-participants, Whitfield identified the challenges the students faced in accessing the written text and the methods the students were using, devised by themselves, to try to overcome them. 

 Major findings from the research included: 

1.  Weak working memory and speed of processing difficulties can severely affect the practical development and outcomes of dyslexic students’ work. These processing difficulties in holding information in working memory, remembering meanings, ordering, and sequencing of actions can have as detrimental an impact on class work and performance, as the reading difficulties connected to dyslexia. Teaching strategies therefore, must consciously support the faculty of memory. 

1.  When reading Shakespeare’s words, ideas extrapolated from the text are created in the mind through the medium of mental images. For those with dyslexia difficulties, these mental images are often translated into external conceptual models, represented through physical actions, or as drawn symbols, colours and pictures onto a surface. These symbols provide concrete representations of the individual’s ideas, which are constructed from the written text. These create a parallel text, overcoming the need for the individual to re\-engage with the alphabetic text. This automatic system used by some individuals with dyslexia in creating their individual versions of the text can be further developed into methods of teaching practice in studio exercises. 

1.  The exploitation of mnemonic devices \(using pictures and actions, expressive marks and PowerPoint presentations\) can aid the individual’s comprehension, articulation, interpretation, memory \(spatial and verbal\) and performance of Shakespeare. This mnemonic approach to the text can serve as an acting method, not only as an aid to thinking and memory support, but in unlocking creative forms of expression. 

1.  When working on the text, the content should be organised into small units of focus in order to reduce cognitive overload, and then processed through structured pathways, which guide the recognition of the words and their meaning, before being placed into long\-term memory. 

1.  Acting and voice teachers need to possess not only a deep knowledge of their specialised subject, including a knowledge of pedagogical theory, but crucially, a knowledge about dyslexia. Pedagogical support can be significantly improved if the teacher has studied the characteristics of dyslexia in close observation of their dyslexic students rather than relying on generic learning support information offered across institutions. 

1.  Humanistic approaches of pedagogy, which emphasise a nurturing of the individual and their differences and a fostering of their distinctive strengths, are necessary for the individual to achieve their potential. 

 The research led to Whitfield developing new practical tools and teaching methods as a solution for the problems of dyslexia, and to highlight individual abilities that had been previously masked by dyslexia. Whitfield devised several distinctive strategies, including a guide of procedure and underpinning theory for studio exercises, when working with Shakespeare’s text. The strategies include the compensatory measures utilised by those with dyslexia, as being advantageous to their individual cognitive styles. They were extensively trialed with actors to test their value in facilitating memory, accuracy of word and freedom for the individual in their process of acting. These approaches were shared with other teachers, dyslexic students and those in similar communities of teaching and learning.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has impacted globally on students, actors and teachers of acting in two main areas: professional actor training and inclusive teaching. 

 **Professional actor training leading to employability** 

 Whitfield’s new teaching strategies improved the self\-confidence and emotional wellbeing of dyslexic students enabling them to successfully train as actors, as former students note: 

 *‘When I first started university, I had no idea how to deal with my disability. I found it hard to even talk about it because of embarrassment. Dr Whitfield was the first person in my life to offer an alternative to how I was dealing with it. Being an actor, possibly the biggest part of your job is learning lines. Not only do you have to remember lines but in order to give a truthful performance and engage your audience, we have to completely be at peace with the meaning and weight of the words. This was all something I was unable to do’.* **\(S1\)** 

 *‘lt was the moment I started to believe in myself, that I was good enough to pursue this as a career and finally it gave me a deeper understanding of Shakespearian text, which at school I really struggled to grasp and connect with’.* **\(S1\)** 

 Students were enabled to audition successfully for Shakespearean roles: 

 *‘To this day, I still use the same monologue \(Cymbeline \- Posthumous Act 5, Scene 5\) to successfully gain work at the prestigious Globe Theatre in London \(Blue Stockings\) and toured with The Globe in Eternal Love. I can certainly trace it all back to that one* \[taught\] *unit, a turning point for me*’. **\(S1\)** 

 And secure ongoing roles in TV series such as the BBC’s *Doctors* \(2016\-18\) requiring the reading and learning of lines quickly over many episodes: 

  

 *‘I put Petronilla’s method into place constantly. Rather than a detailed drawing, I would establish a shape for each section of my script and draw it repeatedly whilst saying the lines. Because of Petronilla’s development of this method in working with me at university, I have found a method that assists me as a professional actor with reading and remembering my lines in the text’.* **\(S1\)** 

 Whitfield’s work has raised awareness of the challenges faced by dyslexic actors who have gained employment: 

 *‘I see them \[dyslexic actors\] often having to work harder to get there and feel it would be desirable to give them more support so that they can get the job done with less stress and anxiety. Petronilla really helped me become more aware of dyslexia, of the different ways that it manifests. Not every dyslexic reads or learns in the same way, which is not something that I really had any awareness of at all*’. \(Head of Voice and Text at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival 2017\) **\(S5\)** 

 *‘It has been my experience as a trained theatre director who has neuro \- diverse issues that there has been little, if any, open discussion on the subject on neuro –diversity. Petronilla’s guidance has been invaluable in my journey in developing my idea of directing a play focused on working on Shakespeare and actors with disability.’* \(Theatre Director and Disability Arts Advocate, Sydney, Australia 2020\). **\(S2**\) 

 **Stimulating changes in inclusive teaching practices** 

 The research was widely shared at events that attracted broad audiences, including acting, voice specialists, learning support teachers, theatre directors, school teachers, applied arts practitioners, art/drama therapists, specialists in drama and autism and Shakespeare specialists, \(Shakespeare in prisons, Shakespeare and autism etc.\) For example, Whitfield presented her research at the *Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, and Actor Training* symposium, The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, 2017; *Art as Research in Teaching and* *Learning* *International Conference*, University of Wolverhampton, 2016; *Connectors, Communicators & Culture,* Voice and Speech Trainers’ Association International Conference, Orlando, USA, 2019; *Applying* *Shakespeare I and II,* Shakespeare Institute and Surrey University; *British Educational Research Association International Conference,* Sussex University,  *Theatre and Performance Research Association Conference* \(TaPRA\), Bristol University; ‘ *The S Word: Stanislavski and the Future of Acting’* *International Symposium* \- held at Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance. 

 Whitfield’s book which details her methods for teaching dyslexic acting students is included on the reading list of many actor training institutions, including the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama and Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance. Further dissemination has been achieved through global distribution sales of the book to the USA, Finland, Sweden, Israel, India, Singapore, China, Taiwan, and Australia. **\(S10\).** Her work was referenced in articles in the newsletters of leading global charities working to support dyslexics such as ‘Dyslexic Advantage’, USA **\(S9\)** and promoted via public media channels such as KQED based in California **\(S7\).** 

 As well as in the UK, teachers in the USA and Australia, are using Whitfield’s methods to build a more informed, equitable and self\-conscious pedagogy in actor training environments, promoting enablement of those with neurodiversity, rather than a disablement: 

 *‘I was extremely touched by this experience. Not only could I see and hear the results \- even if we had worked …in a pressured context \(the assessment deadline\), but also, I could see for the first time that there are practical things to do to help a student who is struggling with the traditional way of learning in the context of my voice class. I felt excited, and happy. I also felt that I had learned something fundamental, and that I wanted to know more about dyslexia in the context of voice/text*.  \(Voice teacher at Birmingham School of Acting, City University 2017\) **\(S6\)** 

 ‘*The young woman, cast as Hermia was dyslexic and was having a lot of difficulty in     learning her role. Due to her disability, she was fearful of attempting Shakespeare and did not feel confident in her ability to understand nor remember the lines. Using the techniques outlined by Whitfield, we were able to break the verse down into vivid and specific images. The actress then created drawings \- pictographs of a sort \- to help her 'see' the words. Through this creative and detailed work, the actress gradually gained understanding and confidence. She was solidly ""off book"" by the time the show opened and actually enjoyed the process of rehearsing and performing Shakespeare. \[Whitfield’s\] work has deepened my understanding of learning differences and expanded my ability to support student artists on their journey towards expression*’ \(Professor of Voice, Movement and Acting at Florida International University 2019\). **\(S3\)** 

 Whitfield’s strategies have also been adopted by those teaching English as a second language. For example, an English dyslexic teacher, working in international schools in China, directing Shakespearean plays and running workshops with Chinese head teachers about how to understand and learn Shakespeare noted: 

 *‘I used exercises straight from Petronilla’s work. I got the teachers to feel the words of a sonnet and express them in different ways, including physicalizing them, or vocalising the vowels to find the emotion and drawing the feel of the words on to paper to connect the words to the body and imagination. This work went down well with all the Chinese teachers and provided some great results, in the help of understanding and connecting with the words of the text. Dr Petronilla’s specialism is in helping people with dyslexia understand Shakespeare; however, her exercises are perfect for teaching  people in a second language as demonstrated with my classes in China. At the end of the workshops, the teachers expressed how interesting and accessible the methods were which they will take back to their schools when they are teaching English or drama lessons. Whether it’s working with children who are studying English and Shakespeare for the first time, or working with teachers who want a more in depth look at his language, and ideas for teaching, Dr Petronilla’s methods are inspirational … and are easily adaptable for most situations’.* **\(S4\)** 

 Whitfield’s work has been recognized internationally by the American Alliance for Theatre and Education by awarding Whitfield the ‘Johnny Saldaña Outstanding Professor of Theatre Education Award’ \(2020\). This award was given for demonstrating outstanding research, scholarship, teaching and mentoring of students. **\(S8\)**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The International Centre for Coaching and Mentoring Studies’ \(ICCaMS\) empirical and conceptual research has directly impacted on the development of coaching as an applied discipline. Established in 2014, ICCaMS is the only dedicated university\-based, specialist centre for interdisciplinary coaching research, education and training in the UK. Specifically, our work has reformed the accreditation, practice evaluation, professional standards, and coach training approaches employed by coaching practitioners, enriching and enlightening their work. The main beneficiaries of our research are: professional coaching bodies \(e.g. the European Mentoring and Coaching Council \- EMCC\); coach educators, trainers and providers of continuing professional development \(CPD\) \(e.g. Georgetown University School of Medicine and Sydney Business School\); organisations adopting coaching as service users \(e.g. the Civil Service and the NHS\); and many coaching communities \(i.e. coaches and coaching clients\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Despite the exponential growth of coaching in recent decades, its theoretical understanding and empirical groundwork are recognised as under\-developed. To avoid the risks of being ‘a profession without discipline’ \(Bachkirova & Borrington, 2018 – **1ii**\), ICCaMS became one of the few university\-based centres for coaching research, education and training in the world. The Centre is now recognised as a catalyst in the development of a rigorous, evidence\-informed discipline, using its multivalent expertise across psychology, education, management, and organisation studies to contribute to and develop the knowledge\-base of coaching. It has accomplished this status through pioneering empirical and conceptual research that has resulted in critiquing outdated practices, spearheading fact\-based innovations, reframing debates, and developing fresh theoretical and conceptual frameworks. Our multifaceted research has been supported by grants from the Institute of Coaching \(Harvard, USA\) and commissioned by the NHS \(e.g. London Deanery\). As coaching is still a developing discipline in terms of both knowledge and practice, ICCaMS’ empirical and conceptual studies have instigated change in three major areas: 

 **1.** **Professional development of coaches** – ICCaMS is an established and renowned thought leader in the area of professional education, training and development of coaches. Our empirical and conceptual outputs \( **1, 2 and 3**\) challenge established professional education and training by shifting the focus of coach development to the root philosophical underpinnings of coaching rather than viewing coaching as a skills\-based and value\-neutral intervention. This position emphasises the multifaceted role of the coach’s self as an instrument of coaching in the content and delivery of coaching programmes. Through our research \(see specifically **1i\-1iii**\), we challenge the oversimplified and underdeveloped models dominating contemporary coach training, offering fresh propositions that create a shift in thinking and practice. For example, our proposed 3P model of practice \(see **1i**\) has been well integrated into the coach education offered at Sydney Business School primarily because it foregrounds the value of reflecting on the philosophy and purpose of one’s coaching practice, aside from the actual rudiments of that practice \(see Section 4, **E11**\). 

  

 **2. Ethical coaching standards** – A second strand of ICCaMS’ applied research is levelled at a range of non\-academic beneficiaries, including domestic and international coaching practitioners, professional coaching associations, and the wider public seeking coaching services as coaching clients. This strand has provided a solid conceptual foundation for the development of widely accepted ethical principles for the coaching profession, shifting the emphasis from prescribed codes of ethics to the development of a professional culture that prioritises a shared understanding of ethical standards. At a micro\-level, this work informs and supports ethically minded coaching practice in a variety of professional contexts, including business, education, and healthcare. At a macro\-level, it serves wider audiences such as businesses that deploy coaching and professional coaching associations, by developing an ecology of ethics in the currently unregulated coaching world \(see **2**\). 

 **3. Quality assessment and accreditation of coaches** is a function of the professional coaching bodies, which also influences professional education and training programmes. The quality of this process has been heavily dependent on the use of competence frameworks. In paper **3**, such reductive competence frameworks were examined and critiqued and a new model for assessment of coaching proposed. This model developed a notion of capability of coaches in addition to competence, acknowledging a complex array of factors in the self of the coach that influences coaching interactions. The notion of capability has been translated into the mechanisms of coach assessment, which is more congruent with the complexity of coaching practice.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Empirical and conceptual research conducted by ICCaMS has shaped coach accreditation and ethical standards, as well as coach training and education, contributing to the development of coaching as a robust discipline and improving coaching practice worldwide. The impact of our research is described in relation to three main groups of beneficiaries: 

####  Professional coaching bodies: Strengthening accreditation and ethical standards 

 Bachkirova and Lawton\-Smith’s research \( **3**\) on capabilities has been instrumental in the introduction of improved accreditation approaches and guidelines at the European Mentoring and Coaching Council \(EMCC\) and the International Authority for Professional Coaching and Mentoring \(IAPCM\) \( **E1, E2**\). The EMCC, a major professional coaching association with 6,000\+ members across 61 countries, used this research directly to revise their *‘accreditation frameworks … for validation of training programmes and the assessment of coaches’* \( **E1**\). More specifically, as a result of said research, the Council changed its approach to coach assessment and accreditation for members, from an established competences\-based framework to one focusing on capabilities \( **E1**\). This is significant, as accreditation is one of the few quality assurance mechanisms available to coaching as an unregulated profession. The Chief Operating Officer of the IAPCM \(900\+ organisational and individual members across 24 countries\) also attests to changes in their assessment and accreditation processes for their global membership, as a result of Bachkirova and Lawson\-Smith’s research, confirming that they have devised *‘an excellent method of truly exploring the holistic element of coaching’* \( **E2, E3**\). 

 Iordanou’s conceptual work on coaching ethics \( **2**\) resulted in a re\-evaluation of the EMCC’s code of ethics and shaped its new best practice guidelines. More specifically, Iordanou’s contribution to an EMCC green paper on ethical standards for coaching as an unregulated profession led directly to the EMCC remodelling its focus on ethical standards \( **E4**\). Furthermore, Iordanou consulted on and co\-drafted the ‘FCC Guidance Document’ \(2017\), a policy document on the principles of efficacious, evidence\-based coaching that aligns with ethical practice \( **E5**\) produced by the Future of Coaching Collaboration \(FCC\), a multi\-stakeholder group that includes representatives from corporations \(e.g. GlaxoSmithKline, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the John Lewis Partnership etc.\), leading coaching professional bodies \(e.g. Association for Coaching and EMCC\), academic institutions and research institutes. Bachkirova and Iordanou also contributed further guidance on ethical standards as expert panellists to the FCC. 

####  Organisational commissioners of coaching and their coaching communities: Improving coaching practice 

 ICCaMS’ research outputs \( **3** and **1iv**\) have changed coaching practice in the NHS \( **E10**\), parts of the Civil Service \( **E6**\), and Bournemouth University’s Learning and Development Department \( **E7**\). These organisations have adopted new models on capabilities developed by ICCaMS to inform the assessment and accreditation of coaches. For example, Civil Service Learning \(CLS\) highlighted that ‘ *Oxford Brookes University have provided invaluable support to the coaching offer we in CSL provide for around 450,000 Civil Servants*’, and this includes ‘ *developing an approach to validation for around 200 internal coaches and running validation sessions to ensure a consistent standard of internal coaching*’ \( **E6**\). Moreover, our research has changed the way practice is evaluated in the medical sphere. As Dr Margaret Carey, Co\-founder of ‘A Whole New Doctor’ – a leadership development and coaching program for medical students at Georgetown University School of Medicine – has confirmed: *‘Your article has helped recognise coaching and mentoring as complex adaptive systems, which resonates with the medical profession’* and it is now used as *‘our instruction manual’* \( **E9**\). These are important impacts in a developing a discipline caught between the tensions of an unregulated but rapidly expanding field of learning and development. 

 The Centre’s scholarly commitment to informing non\-academic audiences about coaching as a quality learning and development intervention is testament in its wider outreach activities. In 2015, ICCaMS was commissioned to provide the regular research\-led column “Research matters” in *Coaching at Work*, the largest practitioner coaching magazine \(2,000\+ subscribers, primarily in the US and the UK, but also in other European countries, and a global LinkedIn group with almost 42,000 members\). As part of this endeavour, ICCaMs members publish outlines of evidence\-based research outputs, written in an accessible style for non\-specialist audiences. The editor of *Coaching at Work* has testified that ‘ *from feedback to Coaching at Work, we know that the Research Matters column produced by ICCaMS has engaged and challenged the coaching community with its latest academic research and thought\-provoking pieces*’ \( **E8**\). This column typically draws on the open access, peer\-reviewed periodical the *International Journal of Evidence\-Based Coaching and Mentoring*, which, founded by ICCaMS in 2003, publishes extended, rigorous conceptual and research\-based papers. 

####  Coach educators, training and CPD providers: Shaping education and professional development 

 ICCaMS research on coaches’ educational and professional development has had documented impact on educators and training providers, informing, modifying, and improving their programmes \( **E9, E10, E11**\), with ICCaMS’ work adopted as a ‘model of practice’ \( **E11**\). A priority of ICCaMS has been in creating a solid knowledge base for the professional education and development of coaching practitioners. References **1i**, **1ii** and **1iii** challenge the oversimplified models of coach training and education, shifting thinking and practice. For example, Sydney Business School have used **1i** as the underlying framework for their Master of Business Coaching programme. As one Associate Lecturer from Sydney Business School has testified ‘ *\[Your\] model \[proposed in **1.i**\] has enabled us to make tangible a key tenet of \[our\] programme, which is that the way we choose to coach is deeply personal, based upon our preferred theoretical models and personal values*’ \( **E11**\). 

 ICCaMS research has resulted in the production of extensive professional guidance, which is being implemented by leaders in the field of coach training. The *Complete Handbook of Coaching* \(2010, 2014, 2018\), edited by members of the ICCaMS team, is adopted as the main coaching textbook by leading university\-based training programmes \(including Cambridge, Warwick, and Henley Business School\) and it has been purchased by over 350 libraries worldwide. This text sits alongside three handbooks published by ICCaMS staff, recognised as the ultimate guidebooks shaping the knowledge base of coaching. Moreover, Iordanou’s volume on ethical coaching practice \( **2**\) achieved recognition as the Henley Business School’s Coaching Book of the Year \(2017\). These publications have engaged the coaching profession and led to recognition that the sustainable development of coaches depends on engagement with rigorous research and theories \( **E12**, see also **E7**\). 

 In sum, ICCaMS has contributed to the development of coaching as a robust discipline, producing both empirical and conceptual research that has been shaping coach training and education, assessment, and ethical practice.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since 2005, CCRI has pioneered and established action\-oriented, participatory and inclusive research relationships with stakeholders in contrasting local initiatives, promoting sustainable and resilient land management through social innovation, and co\-designing agri\-environmental governance. CCRI researchers have engaged for significant periods in place\-based, bottom\-up land management initiatives in England \(Exmoor, Upper Thames catchment, Marlborough Downs, Stroud\) to demonstrate the value of local\-level involvement, and harness local knowledge, in agri\-environmental design and implementation. This co\-development process has enabled local stakeholders to engage in more effective action, increase impact and thereby build their capacity to analyse, develop and influence future farming policy in England, beyond Brexit. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 CCRI’s sustained engagement in local land management initiatives has forged real world impacts from a suite action\-oriented research programmes. Playing the role of enabler, evaluator and critical friend has added new knowledge, insights and co\-evaluation capacity to several developing initiatives. The approach has combined social science, natural science and creative arts methods to stimulate social innovation in agri\-environmental decision\-making. Research teams have established trusting relationships where research outputs were co\-created and closely interwoven with policy and practice processes and outcomes. Partners have identified this as an unusual way of working for a university research institute, which they particularly value. Our investment in multi\-actor partnerships has brought stakeholders together to develop co\-evaluation and reflexive learning, increasing their ability to find integrated solutions to land management challenges. Through these experiences, the initiatives have gained increased confidence and reputation, which has in turn influenced national policy.  Specific research programmes underpinning the impacts are as follows: 

 A suite of CCRI project evaluations and related systemic analyses \(e.g. Dwyer 2014\), including a major farm survey, workshops and several strategy papers researched and co\-developed with multi\-stakeholder partners in Exmoor over ten years, culminated in publication of ‘Exmoor’s Ambition’: a transformative proposal for sustaining and enhancing Exmoor's farmed landscapes and communities, in 2016. The stakeholder partnership is now one of Defra’s ‘tests and trials’ for the new Environmental Land Management \(ELM\) programme. 

 • In sustained co\-development of the Stroud Natural Flood Management project \(NFM, 2015\-present\), CCRI has worked with Stroud District Council and the Environment Agency to reduce flood risk and boost biodiversity in the Frome catchment. NFM uses various natural interventions in the catchment’s headwaters to ‘slow the flow’ and reduce the risk of flooding, providing a low\-cost, bottom\-up approach that has meaningfully engaged local communities and farmers. CCRI’s co\-evaluation included a report and a film about the project, promoting the approach \(Short et al 2018\). The initiative thereby achieved national recognition and the former project officer is now a national NFM policy adviser in the Environment Agency. 

 • The Water with Integrated Local Delivery \(WILD\) project \(2012\-2019\) is a partnership of FWAG, Gloucestershire Rural Community Council, Cotswold Water Park and CCRI, pioneering integrated delivery of natural resource enhancements in the Upper Thames catchment.  WILD has engaged parish councils, communities and land managers in sustainable management of watercourses, tackling challenges including pesticide contamination and local flooding. CCRI and FWAG co\-developed and applied an innovative Integrated Local Delivery framework within WILD \(Short 2015\). This novel, systems\-based approach was further evaluated and promoted in the EU research project PEGASUS \(Dwyer et al, 2020\) and accepted as a case study in sustainable management by the International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative. The partners are now running a test and trial for Defra’s ELMs. 

 • Marlborough Downs farmer\-led initiative \(Mills et al 2016\) developed innovative action for biodiversity, amenity and community outreach, co\-ordinated by an expert facilitator\-adviser \(Ingram et al 2020\). CCRI was invited to co\-develop evaluation and knowledge\-sharing activities with the initiative, over a critical 3\-year period. This enabled its re\-design, generating renewed enthusiasm for further activity and achievements. It subsequently became an ELMS test and trial project.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 CCRI’s research and evaluation activities, supporting and enabling co\-production and co\-design of environmental initiatives with farmers, land managers and rural communities, have resulted in three main impacts, identified by key actors: 

1.  A shift in appreciation by Defra of the benefits of working with place\-based, bottom\-up initiatives, and the adoption of co\-design as a central feature in development of the Environmental Land Management Scheme \(ELMS\) as the future farm support policy for England; 

1.  Enabling and strengthening local actor interconnections, reflexive practice and capacity\-building within initiatives, generating more local impact and greater confidence to engage with and influence national policy; 

1.  Evidence and facilitation to ensure these initiatives can secure funding for the future. 

###  A. Influencing government thinking and approaches to agri\-environmental policy design 

 CCRI’s work has helped these initiatives to influence Defra’s approach to developing the Environmental Land Management \(ELM\) scheme for England. 

 Because of CCRI’s research activities in these cases, there is: 

-  Greater appreciation by local stakeholders of the complexities of public goods and ecosystem services delivery \(Dwyer et al 2020\), stimulating innovative local action with direct relevance to national policy. 

-  stronger evidence of the value of co\-design approaches \(Ingram et al 2020\) feeding into the national policy development process \(Short et al 2018\); 

 more confidence that targeted and tailored actions that meet both environmental and socio\-economic needs locally \(Dwyer 2014\) are simultaneously meeting national policy objectives \(Short 2015\). 

###  B. Strengthening the development and implementation of local initiatives 

 CCRI’s action\-oriented research with local initiatives has led to effective governance approaches based on partnership, where researchers engage with land managers and policy actors in the co\-design, ongoing reflection and shared implementation of agri\-environmental schemes and sustainable land management initiatives \(Dwyer et al 2020\). Through CCRI research teams’ facilitation, continuous evaluation and feedback, improved relationships have been promoted between land managers and local organisations, enabling empowerment of these partnerships. In turn this has led to tangible environmental and social benefits, including enhanced biodiversity and landscape quality in Exmoor\); reduced flooding in Stroud\); improved water quality in the Upper Thames and in the generation of local social capital and quality of life in all locations, evident through new recreation opportunities, stronger community bonds, more shared understanding between actors and greater confidence to work together. 

 In Exmoor, CCRI has stimulated collective action among farmers to form the Exmoor Hill Farming Network \(EHFN\), with support of Exmoor National Park Authority \(ENPA\), and subsequently worked with these partners and others to build a shared vision for future farming and the environment, culminating in the publication of the ‘Exmoor Ambition’. The Chair of EHFN and the Chair and Chief Executive of ENPA highlighted that CCRI’s involvement transformed the relationship between the NPA and land managers, for the better \(Mills et al 2016\).  Without this they would not have been able to bid for Defra’s ‘test and trial’ and influence the development of ELM. The Exmoor Ambition received significant attention from Defra, including a Ministerial visit, and the NPA and EHFN have been overwhelmed by the number of farmers wanting to engage as a direct result of CCRIs research. 

###  C. Securing future funding 

 CCRI’s focus on sustainability and resilience within local initiatives has shown the value of institutional innovation, which has in turn proved to be instrumental in securing future funding. Investment in strong, multi\-actor partnerships facilitated by the research has ensured that partners are able to access wider and more varied funders. 

 In WILD, CCRI acted as a critical friend \(Dwyer et al 2020\) in an EA\-funded initial project \(2013\-16\).  This was continued in a follow\-on project \(2016\-19\) with three separate funders.  The current project runs for a further 3 years with five funding streams covering a diverse range of issues, all hinging around local actors implementing and achieving improved natural resource management. WILD’s innovative capacity has made the case study a flagship Defra ‘test & trial’ project and stimulated funding successes for broader goals and new project activities, including major new charity\-funded project investigating WILD’s potential to deliver local food.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In response to the 2006 Cooksey Review of UK health funding, nationwide networks of applied health research centres were piloted from 2008 to 2013. These centres, called CLAHRCs \(Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research & Care\), were funded by the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) and designed to improve healthcare by more effectively translating clinical research into practice. Professor Graeme Currie was Director for CLAHRC Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire until December 2010, after which he moved to Warwick Business School \(WBS\). 

 Drawing on research which analysed the pilot phase, Prof. Currie of WBS, with colleagues from Nottingham, developed a new implementation model, founded on organisation science research that was adopted by the West Midlands during the second phase of CLAHRCs. This research led to Prof. Currie’s appointment as Deputy Director of the CLAHRC West Midlands, which ran from 2014 to 2019, supported by a GBP9,000,000 investment from the NIHR. During this period, Prof. Currie and colleagues at WBS applied and refined the implementation model, which improved knowledge brokering, distributed leadership towards the middle of the organisation and strengthened human resource management. The application of the model within CLAHRC West Midlands has resulted in evidence\-based change in frontline NHS services, leading to benefits for staff and patients in maternity, musculoskeletal disease, mental health and cancer services in the region \- and in Australia and India, where the model has also been adopted.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Billions are spent on generating research evidence to explore what clinical interventions work to address long\-term health conditions, in terms of effectiveness, cost efficiency, and patient experience. However, such research evidence is slow to trickle into frontline service delivery. 

 CLAHRCs were introduced by the NIHR, which was established in response to a new research and development strategy in the NHS: Best Research for Best Health. They were designed to address the “second gap in translation” identified by the Cooksey Review of 2006; namely, the need to improve healthcare in the UK by accelerating the translation of clinical research evidence into practice. 9 CLAHRCs, each encompassing a university in partnership with local NHS bodies, were funded and piloted over the period 2008 \- 2013. WBS research has involved the application of theoretical perspectives from organisation science alongside empirical studies of the creation, translation and use of knowledge and innovation. From 2010, this expertise was applied to the CLAHRC initiatives and became a focus of new research, including: 

 2011 to 2014: Professors Lockett and Currie, and colleagues from WBS, were funded by NIHR to conduct intensive research studies, examining pilot CLAHRCs in the UK. The research was carried out over two overlapping time phases to capture changes in the new CLAHRCs over time. The project underpinned a published report, which provided an independent and theory\-based evaluation of CLAHRCs. The findings highlighted that translation of clinical research evidence into practice was supported by knowledge brokering and distributed leadership, and that human resource management interventions in the realm of recruitment and selection, training, performance management and job design shaped this **\(3.1\)**. 

 2011 to 2012: As Director of one of the pilot CLAHRCs \(Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire\), Prof. Currie had implemented a model for translation of clinical research evidence into practice, which, following his move to WBS, he evaluated with colleagues from the University of Nottingham 2011 \- 2012 **\(3.2\)**. This research demonstrated that barriers to implementation of evidence\-based innovation can be overcome if knowledge is coproduced by academic and clinical service staff, taking account of the organisational context in which it is to be applied. This approach was founded on organisational science theory. 

 In 2013: 13 new regional CLAHRCs were competitively awarded for the period 2014 \- 2019, including CLAHRC West Midlands, an ambitious initiative designed to build capacity for implementing evidence\-based innovation across academia, the health service, and among public and patients in the West Midlands, and to enhance the capacity of these sectors to interact with the other. Based on WBS’s previous research and expertise in this area, Prof. Currie was appointed Deputy Director of the CLAHRC West Midlands, and led a WBS\-based research team working at the centre of the CLAHRC throughout the 2014 \- 2019 phase. Drawing on the findings of the earlier research into “what works” for effective knowledge transfer of evidence\-based innovation in complex health settings, the team undertook a comprehensive programme of applied research. This programme, conducted under a cross\-cutting *Implementation and Organisational Studies* theme within the CLAHRC, delivered state\-of\-the\-art management expertise for the implementation of evidence\-based innovation across four clinical service themes, relating to maternity and child health, youth mental health, disease prevention and chronic disease. 

 Research conducted by the WBS team within CLAHRC West Midlands: 

1.  Identified what healthcare providers should do to ensure receptive context for evidence\-based innovation, including in Australia and India **\(3.1, 3.2, 3.3\)**, specifically how best to mobilise knowledge **\(3.2, 3.3, 3.4\)**. 

1.  Identified how leadership should be distributed across healthcare providers to support implementation and scale up of evidence\-based innovation, including in India and Australia **\(3.5, 3.6\)**. 

1.  Identified what human resource policies and practices healthcare providers should implement to best engage their clinical workforce in implementing and scaling up evidence\-based innovation **\(3.7\)**. 

1.  Identified how middle managers represent crucial conduits in scaling up evidence\-based healthcare **\(3.8\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The pilot NIHR CLAHRC West Midlands \(WM, then termed ‘Birmingham and Black Country’\) was based on a clinical\-academic tradition which focused on the production of high\-quality academic publications, assuming frontline managers and clinicians would adopt guidance and evidence published in academic journals intuitively. This had limited impact upon frontline practice and clinical outcomes. Contrasting with this, during the 2014 \- 2019 CLAHRC WM, Prof. Currie and the WBS research team worked alongside hospital practitioners and clinical academics to ensure evidence\-based innovation was embedded in frontline practice more effectively, using approaches to implementation derived from their organisation science focused research \(e.g. **3.1\-2**\). Director of the CLAHRC WM, Richard Lilford, confirms that the research centre adopted the implementation model developed by Prof. Currie, stating, “ *As a cross\-cutting theme, the implementation model of coproduction and knowledge brokerage was embedded within our clinical themes/health care settings. This has been an extremely effective implementation model to deliver service change and improvements in both managerial and clinical outcomes; for example, in maternity services \(BSOTS triage intervention with Birmingham Women’s Hospital\)\) and musculoskeletal disease \(StartBack intervention for lower back pain across Staffordshire*\)” **\(5.1\)**. 

 Senior Manager for CLARHC WM from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Paul Bird, further attests to the impact of this approach, stating, “ *There is no doubt that the team from Warwick Business School provided lessons from their research that caused a major restructuring of the CLAHRC in the West Midlands towards a model of translational health research that encompassed knowledge brokering in our system to draw down and use evidence for service improvement*…We see the results in a step change in services ranging from maternity triage, to lower back pain interventions, to early intervention in youth mental health, right across healthcare providers in the West Midlands, with significant patient benefit"" **\(5.2\)**. 

 Benefits arising from the 2014 \- 2019 CLAHRC WM included: 

 **The scale up of an evidence\-based intervention in maternity units:** Women are traditionally seen in the order in which they arrive at a maternity unit, if experiencing problems prior to, or after, birth. This differs to an accident and emergency unit where patients are triaged by clinical priority. Prof. Currie’s research team supported implementation of a maternity triage system \(BSOTS\) by providing lessons focused upon clinical engagement, midwifery leadership and strategies to adapt the intervention for different maternity units **\(3.1\-5\)**. Lead Clinician Sara Kenyon testified that: “Work from the qualitative research elements helped the BSOTS team develop new knowledge about how the BSOTS tool had been implemented in different maternity units, in preparation for national and international roll out” **\(5.3\)**. Following the WBS implementation support, the evidence\-based triage system has been introduced in 14 maternity units, with another 27 in progress with “54% of women seen within 15 minutes \(compared to 39% before\). This means the service is safer"" **\(5.4\)**. 

 **The scale up of an evidence\-based intervention in musculoskeletal services:** Research **\(3.4\)**, coproduced with primary care clinicians, exemplifies the effective application of the knowledge brokerage implementation model proposed by earlier research **\(3.2\)** to support the scale up of a new non\-surgical service model called ‘STarT Back’ – Stratified care for low back pain. Krysia Dziedzic, Director of the Impact Accelerator Unit, Keele University, confirmed that “ *this new model results in greater health benefits, achieved at a lower average health\-care cost, with an average saving to health services of GBP34.39 per patient and societal savings of GBP675 per patient”,* and that *“your research on the implementation and scale up of primary care innovations informed efforts by our Impact Accelerator Unit \(GPs, physiotherapists and patient representatives\) to spread STarT Back for patient benefit”* **\(5.5\)**. 

 **Scaling up the use of a Dimensions of Health and Wellbeing Tool, designed to help young people self\-manage their mental health condition and access services developed by Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust \(CWPT\):** CWPT provide mental health and learning disability services for more than 1,000,000 people of all ages. Despite the increasing prevalence of mental health conditions presenting in young people, services have not kept pace and youth mental health has been under\-resourced, hence dubbed the ‘Cinderella’ of healthcare provision. This necessitates much more emphasis upon young people and their carers self\-managing their condition. Drawing upon their insights about the need for distributed leadership to scale up innovation **\(3.5\)** and the knowledge brokering capabilities of middle managers to embed innovation in practice **\(3.8\)**, the research team from WBS worked alongside frontline clinicians and managers to put the Dimensions of Health and Wellbeing Tool in place to support patient self\-management. Dr. Sharon Binyon, Medical Director, and Dominic Cox, Director of Strategy and Development, at CWPT, describe how WBS research alerted them to, and suggested solutions for, diffusing the innovation, stating that “This has ensured smooth roll out of the tool with maximum patient benefit; i.e. those young people that need access to services are able to identify and get the care they need quickly, and so outcomes for them are much improved"" **\(5.6\)**. 

 **Supporting Leadership and Digital Innovation at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire’s \(UHCW\):** As part of CLAHRC WM research, the WBS research team worked closely with the management at board, middle and frontline levels within UHCW, an NHS Trust that manages 2 major hospitals in Coventry and Rugby, serving a population of over 1,000,000 people. UHCW CEO, Andrew Hardy, confirmed the research **\(3.5\-6\)** had supported the hospital’s Executive Board saying it “ *was very useful for the board to understand the strategic context in which we work and the part that we play in it as leaders and our interaction with them. We now have a common way of trying to lead in the organisation, a common language, and actually understanding what we are about, and that feeds directly into patient care’’* **\(5.7\)**. 

 CEO Hardy added that the research **\(3.6\-8\)** had also “ *brought attention to the role of the middle manager \- what the tensions are, the pressures in house and how you deal with that and the effects it can have as well”* **\(5.7\)**. This insight led UHCW to commission a leadership development programme, which embeds lessons from research to support a newly\-constituted clinical directorate leadership team to enhance their capability to develop supportive HR practices for their departments **\(3.7\)**. The Hospital also changed its existing distributed leadership development programme delivered to frontline staff, to drive evidence\-based service innovation, based on WBS research insights **\(3.5\)**. CEO Hardy recognised the contributions made by the WBS team to improving leadership across the organisation more broadly, linking this to a recently awarded, improved rating of 'Good' from the Care Quality Commission **\(5.7\)**. 

 Additionally, CEO Hardy confirmed **\(5.7\)** that the research **\(3.5\)**, conducted alongside Consultant Clinical Oncologist, Penny Kechagioglou, informed UHCW’s digital healthcare innovation strategy, enabling digital technology to be embedded in the oncology care pathway across different organisations and professions, with improvements to services and clinical outcomes. 

 **The implementation model and innovation approaches have been applied internationally, improving health service delivery in India and Australia:** In India, WBS researchers worked with the Schizophrenia Research Foundation \(SCARF\), a non\-governmental, not\-for\-profit organisation providing psychiatric care and rehabilitation services across the whole of Tamil Nadu State. The body of WBS research **\(3.1\-8\)** supported SCARF with the implementation and scale up of an early intervention services for young people with psychosis **\(5.8\)**. SCARF Director, Dr. Thara Rangaswamy, said insights from research outcomes had been “ *eye\-opening”,* writing that: *“T*hrough incorporating lessons learnt from your implementation science research, we have improved our services, reaching 10\-15% more people than we have done before to reduce prospects of serious mental health among this group’’ **\(5.9\)**. 

 In Australia, WBS research **\(3.1\-4\)** has supported Monash Partners Academic Health Science Centre \(MP AHSC\) and other AHSCs across Australia to improve implementation and scale up of evidence\-based healthcare innovation. Director MPAHSC, Prof. Helena Teede, confirmed that the research insights had been “invaluable”. She added that reciprocal exchange of ideas had “informed and accelerated our impact in implementation and healthcare improvement” and the research had made a “national impact on the thinking and evolution of AHSCs \[the Australian equivalent to CLAHRCs\] across Australia” **\(5.10\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted at UCL has created the first evidence\-based picture of the prevalence, persistence, and impact of Developmental Language Disorder \(DLD\). Data from the research underpins a global campaign to transform the way DLD is understood and discussed. The research findings were taken up by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and other communications and mental health charities and practitioner organisations worldwide, informing their advice to practitioners and providing them with a concrete evidence base to drive their campaigns for national policy change. In the UK, these campaigns culminated in revised government guidance to service commissioners around identifying and supporting people with DLD. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Developmental language disorder \(DLD\) is a persistent neurodevelopmental condition associated with academic underachievement, increased risk of poor mental health, and long\-term unemployment.  However, diagnosis of DLD has been hampered for a long time by inconsistent and misleading terminology and by an incorrect assumption that language impairment that was “specific” to language was fundamentally different to language impairments that occurred in the context of broader cognitive challenges. This assumption led to the systematic use of low non\-verbal IQ scores to exclude children from receiving specialist language support. 

 The Surrey Communication and Language in Education Study \(SCALES\) is a longitudinal population study of language development and disorder from school entry to secondary transition, funded by Wellcome and ESRC. The study was conducted in two phases, both led by Professor Norbury. The first phase \(screening of 7267 children and in\-depth assessment of a sub\-sample of 600 children\) began in 2011 at Royal Holloway and moved to UCL in 2016 where it was continued, completed and published. The second phase, a longitudinal follow\-up study beginning in 2018, was conducted entirely at UCL. 

 **Prevalence and persistence of DLD** 

 Prof Norbury’s population study was the first in the UK to document the number of children starting mainstream school with a clinically and educationally significant language disorder. The research estimated that 7.58% of children had DLD and a further 2.34% had a language disorder associated with another biomedical condition \[ **R1**\]. The longitudinal study highlighted strong stability in child language throughout primary school, with a 2 to 3\-year language gap between those with DLD and their peers persisting to the end of Year 6 \[ **R2**\]. The findings show that identification of DLD in the first year of school is reliable and unlikely to spontaneously resolve. 

 **Diagnostic criteria for DLD** 

 SCALES data provide key evidence of the non\-validity of accepted discrepancy criteria, in which non\--verbal IQ must be within normal limits and significantly greater than language skills to warrant diagnosis \[ **R1**\]. Instead, SCALES demonstrated minimal differences between children with discrepancies and those for whom non\-verbal IQ fell between \-2 and \-1SD with regard to severity of language deficit, educational attainment or broader behaviour deficits. Non\-verbal IQ was therefore found not to be valid as a diagnostic criterion for DLD. The longitudinal study also showed that it was not a significant predictor of change in language competence over the first three years of school \[ **R2**\]. 

 **Functional impacts of DLD** 

 SCALES measured social, emotional and behavioural profiles associated with DLD, showing a clear link to increased rates of clinical symptoms in all domains \[ **R1**\] **.** The project was unique in incorporating standard measures of academic attainment as indicators of functional impact. Findings demonstrated that only 11% of children who meet criteria for DLD meet early curriculum targets \[ **R3**\]. In addition, this is the only study to include data from children learning English as an additional language. The research showed that English language performance at school entry is highly predictive of school attainment data three years later in both monolingual and bilingual children \[ **R4**\]. The research further demonstrated that children with DLD are more likely to be judged as having significant symptoms of attention deficit, but that teachers are significantly more likely to rate children as having inappropriate attention \(21% of children with DLD\) than parents are \(3% of children with DLD\). The research demonstrated robustly that early language skills predict \(even in Y6\) a child’s ability to recognise emotional cues from both voices and faces and have a clear impact on emotion regulation \[ **R5**\]. 

 The CATALISE consortium was established in 2015 to address the lack of consistency in terminology. Through two Delphi exercises, Professor Norbury contributed SCALES evidence concerning diagnostic criteria, specifically the impact of removing non\-verbal IQ criteria from the diagnosis on clinical profile, educational impact, and prevalence of DLD. These data are cited in the 2016 CATALISE paper \[ **R6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Driving a global campaign to raise awareness of DLD** 

 The CATALISE consensus paper **\[R6\]** used the evidence from SCALES to establish a new, consistent terminology around DLD, including the use of the term Developmental Language Disorder itself to replace ‘Specific Language Impairment’. As a result, the campaign RALLI \(Raising Awareness of Language Learning Impairment\) changed its name to RADLD and used the publication of the CATALISE paper to launch the first International DLD Day in 2017 to publicise the new terminology, spread key findings and reach out to the worldwide community of teachers, speech and language therapists \(SLTs\), parents and children. Now in its 4<sup>th</sup> year, DLD Day has 759 ambassadors representing 48 countries, with resources translated into 28 languages **\[S1\]**. Subscribers to RADLD’s YouTube channel more than doubled from approx. 2.5k to 5.4k after the first DLD Day, and now number over 13.5k in 130 countries. A short information video made to accompany the first DLD Day has been viewed over 82,000 times **\[S2\]** and contains one of the key messages on prevalence \(‘2 children in every classroom’\) drawn directly from SCALES research and widely adopted, and quoted in the UK Parliament **\[S3\]**. The 2020 DLD Day Twitter hashtag \#DLDseeme was used by 2,647 contributors in a total of 10,376 tweets with a potential reach of almost 5 million people **\[S4\]**. The DLD day campaign has over 9k followers on Facebook and its most popular post of 2020 reached an estimated 53,244 people **\[S1\].** 

 The research has been widely reported in mainstream media including the Times, the Guardian, the Evening Standard, Good Morning Britain and the ITV Evening News. The Times Education Supplement \(TES\) featured the SCALES findings on their front cover in Feb 2018 and recorded a TES podcast by Norbury \(June 2018\) that has been downloaded more than 3000 times. 

 **Informing practice in speech and language therapy, mental health and education** 

 Concerted dissemination activity brought the research to the attention of practitioners in speech and language therapy, mental health and education. Professional organisations and charities incorporated its findings into guidance to their members. 

 The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists \(RCSLT\) represents over 17,000 SLTs in the UK, and some 2.5 million people in the UK with communication support needs. They explain the importance of the SCALES data: “ *Awareness and understanding of language disorder is limited. This is particularly the case amongst other professionals, policy makers, and the general public, but is also the case within SLT. The SCALES study provides the robust, population\-level data we need to address this*” **\[S3\]**. This importance is reflected in their choice of Professor Norbury to deliver the keynote lecture at their national conference in 2017. RCSLT have since used the SCALES findings: in a briefing document for SLTs to contextualise the size of the issue and build the argument for the SLT’s crucial role in supporting children with DLD; a webinar for members to define the prevalence of developmental language disorder and discuss the changes required to SLT services to effectively support people with DLD; a system leaders event \(with Norbury as introductory speaker\) to develop awareness of DLD amongst other key professions \(e.g. educational psychology\) and policy makers; and to guide their own research priorities **\[S3\]**. 

 The Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health \(ACAMH\) invited Norbury to write a Clinical Topics Guide on DLD for their website to support clinical psychologists in identifying DLD and understanding the role of language in social, emotional and behavioural problems. The guideline has received more unique visits \(22,644\) spending more time on average \(5.33 minutes\) than any other Topic Guide on the website. **\[S5\]** 

 I CAN \(the national charity for children and young people’s speech, language and communication\) state that SCALES has been “ *instrumental in informing and steering our work and strategy. Data from SCALES is embedded in I CAN’s key facts and statistics document, a guidance document which is regularly updated, and which is used across our messaging and influencing. In particular, the prevalence data for Developmental Language Disorder have really shaped the way we communicate the issue of children’s communication”* **\[S6\]**. The charity \(whose website is accessed by over 1,200,000 people annually\) uses the data regularly to illustrate how many children that need specialist services are not receiving them. The SCALES data formed an important element in training they provided to staff in the Department for Education around the implications of DLD on children and young people’s life chances. The research led them to remove non\-verbal IQ as the defining criterion for entry into their two specialist schools **\[S6\]**. 

 **Evidencing the Speech and Language policy debate** 

 The findings have informed key reports that advocate a change in approach to young people with speech, language and communication needs. In November 2016, Norbury presented the SCALES research to the All Party\-Parliamentary Group on Speech and Language Difficulties, helping to galvanise the support of MPs and peers. The study findings **\[R1\]** were used in a 2017 report **\[S7\]** by the Communication Trust \(a consortium of over 50 child communication charities\) to evidence the under\-identification of language delay and its serious implications for later life chances; **\[R1\]** featured prominently in the 2018 joint RCSLT/I CAN report *Bercow: ten years on* **\[S8\]** making the case for improved support for children. The same research was quoted by MPs in a parliamentary debate following on from the report’s publication **\[S3\];** and in a 2019 joint paper **\[S9\]** by the Literacy Trust and the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Literacy it was used to evidence the link between development of oral language and reading and writing skills to support calls for initiatives to support early years oral communication. 

 In October 2020, Public Health England and the Department for Education published guidance for all local commissioners and service leads in health and education in England and Wales, *Best start in speech, language and communication*. The document cites research from the UCL team and lays out a model pathway to meet the speech, language and communication needs of children in the early years **\[S10\].** Norbury was on the Expert Advisory Group for the guidance, which cites both her research and *Bercow: 10 years on* **\[S8\]** as evidence of the prevalence of DLD and its serious implications for children’s attainment, and thus the pressing need for multi\-agency support.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Based on University of Brighton \(UoB\) research into new technological and innovation capabilities for SMEs the Green Growth Platform \(GGP\) was established in 2014 and expanded nationally via Clean Growth UK \(CGUK\) in 2018. This business\-innovation network addresses the major challenge of enabling and improving SME business performance and sustainability; CGUK has attracted 1,863 businesses and offers a range of research\-led services to identify new market opportunities, develop innovative products and implement business models to commercialise or scale\-up their innovations. Between 2014 and 2020 the open innovation environment at the GGP has led to 180 new business\-university R&D/innovation projects with a total value of GBP3,840,000. Consequently, 97 new cleantech products and services were developed, 248 jobs created, and 225 jobs safeguarded by SMEs in the cleantech economy. A subset of these SMEs reported an average annual profit increase of 23% over two years.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 The Centre for Change, Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management \(CENTRIM\) at UoB has contributed to the understanding of innovation capability through the study of business learning networks. This research bridges the gap between the theoretical principles and the practice of innovation management and focusses on the essential characteristics for managing innovation in SMEs by addressing their strategy, processes, linkages and people \[Reference 3.1\]. SME innovation activities typically take place in the context of unstructured innovation projects rather than in highly\-structured R&D departments. To cope with resource limitations, SMEs benefit from 'innovation intermediary partners' such as Research Technology Organisations \(RTOs\) and university innovation consultants. The limitations are becoming even more acute for SMEs seeking to utilise more radical technologies in emerging markets such as the Clean Growth sectors. CENTRIM's research has identified innovation capabilities in SMEs as an extended learning process and developed programmes to facilitate the move to higher\-level performance along the continuum from *passive,* through *reactive* and *strategic* to *creative*, where businesses complement internal capabilities with open innovation, assessing risks and benefits of potential partnerships \[3.2\]. 

 To investigate the challenge of supporting SMEs to be strategic and creative, CENTRIM conducted five major research projects, delivered between 2002 – 2019 \[3.6 – 3.10\]. These projects identified three best practice characteristics for improving innovation capability amongst SMEs. First, the research identified the role of learning networks in promoting SMEs' absorptive capacity. Learning networks combine processes of peer\-to\-peer learning with innovation coaching. After determining the characteristics of such networks \[3.3, 3.4\], UoB launched the *Profitnet* programme in 2004 to develop SMEs' innovation capability \(the outcomes of which are evidenced in the REF2014 case study\). Through action research projects, this body of work explored issues such as the formation of knowledge exchange communities; established the 'impartial' facilitation between different interests and potential conflicts; created a trusted environment to monitor and safeguard confidentiality; and examined alternative approaches to innovation coaching \[3.6, 3.7, 3.9\]. 

 Secondly, the research identified the challenges and enablers connecting SMEs with the research base \(eg universities, RTOs\). UoB researchers examined good practice schemes across twelve EU countries, distinguishing between \(i\) behaviour consolidation support schemes \(eg R&D tax incentives\) more appropriate for SMEs with a strong capability and \(ii\) value\-added support schemes, which aim to build up the innovation capability of SMEs from lower to higher levels. The research highlighted the importance of public\-private innovation partnerships, where SMEs' capability is developed through opportunities to partner with universities and large corporations \[3.8\]. 

 Thirdly, UoB considered how Open Innovation \(OI\) partnerships and activities could allow SMEs to complement their capabilities with those of other innovation players \(eg large corporations, other SMEs and the crowd\). The research examined 120 good practice OI projects carried out by SMEs across Europe. The work illustrated the value of developing the right partnership for each stage of the innovation journey and the significance of developing both the strategy and the implementation of an OI partnership. UoB developed a special methodology to facilitate each innovation journey in SMEs \- a methodology that includes a Canvas and an integrated web\-based portal with an OI Readiness Assessment tool, 112 good practice cases and 134 supportive tools \[3.9, 3.10\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 CENTRIM's research expertise in capability\-building and innovation networks for SMEs has evolved through a focus on 'closing the loop' between industry and academia. The research addresses the challenge of SME innovation and forms the basis for CENTRIM's training, coaching and support for SMEs. The research\-led *Profitnet* programme, established in 2004, was then incorporated in 2014 into a full\-scale cohesive network, the Green Growth Platform \(GGP\). GGP was co\-devised and co\-created by CENTRIM and the UoB’s Economic and Social Engagement Team \(EASE\) as an applied knowledge exchange pathway to deliver growth and improved performance through open innovation in the green and clean energy sectors. GGP includes key elements identified by CENTRIM's research, brought together with practical knowledge around business support, innovation, networking and skills delivery from the EASE team, with a specific focus on the green and low carbon sectors. 

 GGP was launched with GBP3,000,000 from HEFCE Catalyst funding focusing on support for low carbon and environmental SMEs across Sussex. This route to impact increased the capacity of UoB to engage with end\-users and GGP, under the leadership of its Director and a large team of business development, knowledge exchange and marketing professionals co\-developed GGP services with CENTRIM staff. The success of GGP led to the development of Clean Growth UK \(CGUK\), the first phase of which ran between 2018 – 2021. CGUK is a national business\-innovation uniting university\-led green business networks to catalyse clean and green innovation and growth; it was established with GBP3,500,000 from Research England's Connecting Capability Fund. The UoB programme connects with two other university\-led hubs based at the University of Portsmouth and Liverpool John Moores University. Since 2014, improvement has been shown across the UoB GGP 1,863 strong SME business member network \[Sources 5.1, 5.2, 5.3\]. 

 CGUK, including the GGP lead hub at UoB, have offered services using CENTRIM's research principles and involving CENTRIM researchers in their delivery. These include: 

1.  *Innovation and R&D services* that link SMEs to research expertise and facilities; 

1.  *Commercialisation services* that support the development of clean products and services through coaching, workshops and Profitnet groups; 

1.  The *Investment Readiness service* that help SMEs prepare for financial investment and access to capital via coaching and workshops/webinars; 

1.  *Access to Skills* through an internship and placement programme for knowledge and technology transfer; 

1.  *Online information and direct support* to help companies connect with each other and access funding for innovation. 

##  4.1 Developing innovation skills, product and process innovations 

 Five annual surveys \(2016\-2020\) were undertaken to assess the impact of the CGUK programme. The surveys show that engagement with GGP/CGUK resulted in increased innovation skills: 78% of SMEs \(average across all five surveys\) acknowledged the impact of the programme on skills for developing new products, services, and processes; and 67% acknowledged the impact on skills required to scan the environment for new ideas and market trends \[5.1\]. The programme supported SMEs to develop 97 new or enhanced 'green' products or services from 2014 to 2020, including: 

-  *new products* \(27% surveyed\) eg a  [filtration system](https://www.pro-earth.co.uk/pro-clean-water) removing metals from wastewater; 

-  *enhanced products* \(23%\) eg an engineered restraint  [lightweight strap](https://tecoproducts.co.uk/products/restraint-straps-waterbar-banding/the-ron-sammons/) that uses 70% less steel but retains the same strength of traditional heavy\-duty straps; 

-  *new services* \(25%\) eg recycling of  [disposable Absorbent Hygiene Products in care homes](https://www.medisort.co.uk/why-were-finding-a-way-to-recycle-used-nappies-and-ahp-waste/), reducing the environmental footprint in manufacturing and disposal processes; 

-  *enhanced services* \(21%\) eg a  [solar\-powered unit](https://yellowbike.biz/index.php/clamp-it/) that attaches to existing on\-street bicycle stands, controlled via an app using RFID technology. 

 In addition, the GGP/CGUK programme supported members to develop 'green' process innovations such as the development of new methods of organising work responsibilities and decision making \(73%, Survey\-2018\), new methods of managing external relationships \(72%, Survey\-2018\), and new internal organisational processes and procedures \(56%, Survey\-2018\). Examples include a  [shredding service](https://www.shreddedneat.co.uk/services/on-site-shredding/) that moved from manual to electronic systems, saving time, cost and materials, and a  [process transforming agri\-residues into paper pulp](https://www.nafici-research.com/process/) \[5.1, 5.2\]. 

##  4.2 Creating open innovation partnerships 

 Of the surveyed members, 77% \(average across all surveys\) recognised the impact of the CGUK/GGP programme on skills for accessing and using external know\-how, and 71% acknowledged the effect on networking skills, with the impact reaching as high as 92% in Survey 2020 \[5.1\]. The GGP UoB hub within CGUK directly facilitated the development of 180 R&D/innovation industry projects between universities and companies with a combined total budget of GBP3,843,289. In Survey2020, 93% of the respondents said they are satisfied with these projects, with 85% recognising considerable impact on the business. OSET Bikes, a world leader in the design and manufacture of electric bikes, stated: 

 *'\[…\] membership of the University of Brighton's Green Growth Platform introduced us to the concept of partnering with a range of experts who could really bring rigour to the development of our next wave of products to boost us to the next level in terms of product design, engineering and manufacturing \[…\] Our company is now working toward the commercialisation of a range of new bikes'.* \[5.4\] 

 The GGP UoB hub has provided significant opportunities for SMEs to offer complementary know\-how and extend innovation. The *Profitnet* programme was found to have a ‘substantial’ impact on 80% of the participants \(Survey\-2020\). Some 54% of the participants collaborated with another company in the programme to advance their innovation project by engaging in joint R&D projects, sharing technologies, developing new products and services, jointly accessing grants and innovation funding, providing mutual business support and advice, as well as joint business ventures and customer/supplier transactions \[5.1\]. 

 An average of 3.24 partnerships have developed for each member \(Survey\-2018\). One example is Akro Value Ltd., which supplies flow control valves and water\-saving technologies. Its Managing Director stated: 

 *'Profitnet was invaluable and worked rather like a non\-exec Board through the sharing of experience, knowledge and ideas in the group. Overall, it was the most comprehensive support we could have hoped for and it provided a boost to the business and through business mentoring and networking with fellow SME's found ways to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency \[…\] The funding made available via the Green Growth Platform, along with the advice we received, enabled us to bring an innovative new product to market and improve our processes and resource efficiency.'* \[5.5\]. 

 The Co\-founder of Zedify, a franchised network of zero\-emissions delivery operators, confirmed: 

 *'This peer\-to\-peer action learning programme has helped us to develop and grow the company into a national network and brand \[…\] Over the period of Clean Growth UK engagement, the company has grown considerably, now operating in 9 UK cities and with over 100 staff, providing 600,000\+ annual deliveries. We raised over £300,000 in investment in 2020 and are recruiting to key positions to support a national franchise roll\-out. The company is now operating integrated zero\-emission first\-mile collections in cities that feed into national carriers including, DPD, Hermes and DHL for national and international services.'* \[5.6\]. 

 The GGP programme developed 15 new modules or courses for HE or FE institutions and between 2014\-2020 helped establish 133 student placements and graduate interns \[5.3\]. Some 60% of SMEs said that the student placements had a substantial impact and 100% claimed the same for graduate interns \(Survey\-2020\) \[5.1\]. For example, Ambiental Risk Analytics, who provide flood\-risk assessment and modelling services, enlisted graduates to help them tackle large flood\-mapping projects. The students were, in the words of the Product Manager, ‘ *a huge asset*’ in ensuring that the flood predictions were accurate \[5.7\]. 

##  4.3 Enabling business skills and financial investment 

 The SMEs surveyed have also reported on the impact of the programme on their business skills. Some 75% of responses \(average across all surveys\) acknowledge an impact on their business strategy and planning skills; 71% on marketing and branding skills \(Survey\-2020\); and 74% on measuring and communicating environmental impact \(Survey\-2020\).  The programme also offered support to assess their investment readiness, with 87% of the respondents reported an impact on their business. By the end of December 2020, the SME members had managed to raise GBP2,576,407 as leveraged investment for their companies. Medisort, a clinical waste management company, partnered with the UoB GGP hub on a series of projects and skills\-development services; they have commented that: 

 *'This has enabled us to develop and secure investment for a dedicated nappy waste treatment and recovery facility \[…\] We have been able to take this project to the stage where we now have land secured for development and three potential schemes vying for pole position to work with us \[…\] The contacts made and disciplines learnt will stay with us forever. Involvement in GGP and Profitnet has helped my business to innovate in many ways \[…\] welcoming an academic element into the organisation brings thinking processes that would otherwise be absent.  It is wonderful to have diverse and thoughtful input to all problem\-solving activities. When we started working with UoB we employed 22 people, now we support 59 households by providing good quality work in an essential sector.'* \[5.8\]. 

##  4.4 Improving employment prospects and business bottom\-line 

 The annual surveys demonstrated that through UoB CGUK/GGP hub activity, members created or safeguarded a total of 473 jobs \[5.1\]. The UoB GGP hub has contributed directly to members' bottom\-line. Between 2016 and 2018, amongst SMEs surveyed, average turnover increased by 26% and average profit increased by 23%. An independent survey \[5.2\] has confirmed areas of excellence provided by the programme, such as business support, university expertise, the professionalism of the services and facilitation of grants for R&D. This evaluation confirmed that GGP/CGUK has helped SMEs in the clean growth sectors to address innovation challenges and implement several innovations involving leadership, staff, internal processes, market channels and – most significantly – in their business strategy and their Open Innovation partnerships \[5.2\]. The GGP/CGUK programme has received widespread recognition from regional authorities and regional and national coverage for its success in creating innovation partnerships, developing business skills and capacity, and safeguarding or creating jobs \[5.9\]. GGP was selected as an  [award\-winning](https://www.eauc.org.uk/2015_green_gown_award_highly_commended) business innovation and growth programme by the Environmental Association for Universities and Colleges \(EUAC\) and won a Green Apple Award for Education and Training \[5.10\]. In 2021, Clean Growth UK was awarded a further GBP1,376,170 to support its activities. This funding will sustain future opportunities for the UoB programme to continue to enable impact in clean growth businesses.

Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Michael Keating’s work concerns how the United Kingdom has reorganised its tiers of government and its external relations to the European Union in a post\-sovereignty age, and how these changes articulate with each other. His research has sought to clarify the competing meanings of terminology used during the debates on Scottish independence and Brexit, while recognising that protagonists operate within different conceptual frames and political languages. His impact involves novel forms of dissemination to enable key stakeholders at all levels of discussion to respond to these changes, allowing the public, politicians and state actors to understand the nature, consequences and implementation of decisions taken. This has taken place during a period of extensive constitutional change, and his work has focussed on the competing understandings of Scottish independence, the European Union, and the nature of Brexit. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2013, Keating’s research has covered two broad areas: the redistribution of social and political powers and systems across the different layers of government \(Rescaling\); and the debate around the concept of political union itself \(Post\-sovereignty\) \[P1\-4\]. This ongoing research has enabled the 2013 foundation of the Centre for Constitutional Change \(CCC\), established as part of the ESRC Future of the UK and Scotland programme in the lead up to the Scottish independence referendum of September 2014 \[P1\]. The CCC represents a consortium of researchers from universities in the UK and Ireland. Since its establishment in 2013, Keating, the Centre’s Director, has led an interdisciplinary programme of research in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh, examining options for constitutional change, including independence and subsequence implications for the future of the UK and Scotland. 

 Rescaling refers to the migration of functional systems, governing institutions and political competition to new levels above and below the state. Keating’s work examines how rescaling of social and political systems – rather than involving the creation of a ‘blank slate’ on which totally new scalar arrangements can be established – occurs through a conflictual ‘layering’ process in which resultant rescaling strategies interact with, and only partially rework inherited social and political systems. Post\-sovereignty refers to the changing meaning of state sovereignty in an interdependent world. 

 Keating’s work has focussed on the Scottish independence \(2014\) and EU \(2016\) referendums. In both cases, the conceptual frameworks drew on Keating’s work on spatial rescaling and post\-sovereignty. These frameworks have been critical to enable Scottish independence and Brexit to be framed not as absolutes but as changing relationships: indeed, the difficulty in defining exactly what Scottish independence or Brexit have really meant, in terms of social or political systems, is often at the heart of the debate. As part of this framework, Keating, in collaboration with the wider CCC, has examined the political debates from an interdisciplinary perspective, drawing on political science, public policy, social policy, economics, international relations and law. 

 **Constitutional Futures and Models of Policy Making \(2013\-14\)** 

 In 2013, Keating undertook research to explore policy models related to the constitutional debate in Scotland. Rather than aiming to show which model would fair best in a normative \(cost\-benefit\) sense, he looked at the institutional foundations and implications of each to examine what version of Scotland might be adaptable to the Scottish case. As part of this project, Keating examined: 

-  the issue of sovereignty within the UK, which has never definitively been resolved; 

-  the status of the Legislative Consent \(Sewel\) Convention, including the Supreme Court rulings; 

-  whether and how an independent Scotland could join the European Union; 

-  the interpretation of the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland; 

-  the place of England in the changing union; 

-  the scope for a differentiated Brexit for Scotland and Northern Ireland. 

 By introducing comparator cases, including independent states and other autonomous regions he was able to examine key features such as shared identities, long\-term census, social partnership, labour market regulation and tensions among the elements. Ultimately, Keating identified two models of adaptation, the market\-liberal and the social\-investment models \[P2; 1, 5\]. 

 **Changing UK in a Changing Europe \(2015\-17\)** 

 In 2015, Keating was awarded an ESRC\-funded fellowship to examine the impact of changing the UK's relationship to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms on the arrangements in the devolved territories. The project analysed these issues in a form accessible to stakeholders and the public, exploring options for change within the UK and Europe and drawing on comparative experience. In particular, this included the changing territorial constitution of the UK within a changing Europe and the prospects for reform. As part of the project, Keating undertook analysis of: 

-  the economic consequences both of Scottish independence and of Brexit; 

-  the currency and public finance options for an independent Scotland; 

-  public finances in Scotland, tax options and prospects after independence; 

-  the meaning and implications of the UK internal market; 

-  the implications of Brexit for agriculture in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 

 Keating focussed on reviewing existing knowledge and dissemination to assess future scenarios for the European Union and the UK's place within it as well as scenarios for constitutional change in the UK itself. This included reviewing different perspectives on Europe among the public, civil society and political parties, and differences in the interests of the component parts of the UK in European policy choices. Keating found that the EU is a key factor underpinning the UK devolution settlement and that membership would allow a more extensive internal devolution than would otherwise be possible \[P3; 2, 3,4\]. 

 **Between two unions. The Constitutional Future of the Islands after Brexit \(2017\-2021\)** 

 Brexit represents an unprecedented event in the history of the European Union and constitutes a real\-time experiment in constitutional reinvention. As such it has taken place in a context with very few rules and unknown outcomes. In 2017, Keating led research exploring the reconfiguration of political, economic and social union after Brexit, in particular, the inter\-relationship between UK withdrawal from the European Union and constitutional change within the UK and Ireland. By undertaking critical examination of claims made by actors in the process he produced a case study, which challenges existing understandings of statehood, sovereignty and union. Keating asked fundamental social questions concerning: 

-  the rescaling of social solidarity; 

-  the meaning of social union; 

-  options for devolution of welfare policies. 

 Keating found that although the ideological foundations of union have been weakening in recent decades, the devolution settlement has been moving towards a form of asymmetrical federalism \[P4\]. 

 Keating’s research has been strongly informed by public opinion. As part of \[P1\-4\] Keating and the wider CCC conducted surveys for both referendums, finding that public opinion on independence was not as polarized as the parties. There was strong support for a middle option which had not been on the ballot paper, although after the referendums the parties moved towards compromise. Combining constitutional analysis with policy studies enabled Keating and the CCC to examine the landscape of an independent Scotland or post\-Brexit beyond formal competences \[1\-5\] with analyses made available here:  [https://threadreaderapp.com/user/CCC\_Research](https://threadreaderapp.com/user/CCC_Research). 

 Keating’s research has ensured provision of impartial, tailored and effective communication to target groups, adjusting messaging to facilitate engagement. Throughout the research has been accompanied by active engagement with policy\-makers, the media and the public, mediated as a two\-way exercise, in which Keating and collaborators were able to inform stakeholders while learning from them about issues, perceptions and priorities. Stakeholders within each project have included policy\-level officials, parliamentarians, professional stakeholders and civil society, including business, trade unions and the voluntary sector, and the general public. Keating facilitated engagement with target groups, through organised events, topical public meetings with participatory elements, and regular engagement with broadcast media and journalists. This work was supported by a strong digital media strategy including release of reports, newsletters and a vibrant social media presence. As a result, Keating has developed an effective and accessible mechanism to communicate findings to non\-academic users in order to inform debate, and in particular to reach the public by providing good analysis in a readily comprehensible form.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The period of deliberations since 2013 has involved considerable constitutional change. Conducting political analysis in 'real time' is challenging, as it requires researchers to anticipate implications in the light of limited evidence. Keating and the wider team at CCC have introduced novel mechanisms to adapt rapidly to policy developments, and to produce substantive, concise and user\-accessible analyses to suit a variety of audiences. These mechanisms have enabled effective communication of on\-going events while retaining a 'big picture' and impartial academic perspective on the development of devolution, the UK state and tis relationship to the EU. The success of this approach, in particular Keating’s focus on end users, is evident in the extent and form of engagement; as a result his research has been picked up by a wide variety of stakeholders at all levels of the constitutional debate: 

 **Enhancing voter understanding** 

 The aim of the CCC is to support the creation of new and effective ways to communicate research findings. The Centre regularly posts online blogs accessible to a wide audience. Since 2013, Keating’s blogs have been viewed over 41, 000 times \[S1\]. In 2014, Keating teamed up with The Hunter Foundation and other leading scholars to produce a free e\-book to answer voters’ questions before the Scottish referendum. This e\-book titled *Scotland’s Decision* was downloaded over 120,000 times in the lead up to the Scottish independence referendum, highlighting its uptake across the public \[S2\].  Due to the success of the first e\-book, a second was released prior to the European referendum titled,  [Britain’s Decision – Facts and Impartial Analysis](https://www.centreonconstitutionalchange.ac.uk/publications/britains-decision-facts-and-impartial-analysis), which involved scholars from the CCC and the David Hume Institute. They identified 19 key questions that underpin the debate and they offer objective, independent analysis of these issues. These books analysed the facts and the relative merits or demerits in an impartial manner to help voters to make their decision. 

 The influence of the CCC can be evidenced in the direction of the Scottish Policy & Research Exchange \(SPRE\), which launched in January 2019 and advocates for policy engagement across the social sciences. SPRE’s Director, Nick Bibby, has stated that his interest in policy engagement was heavily influenced by his time at CCC, building experiences through work in communications and engagement: 

 ‘*the Scottish Policy & Research Exchange would not exist had it not been for the participatory approach to research employed by Michael and the rest of the CCC team. This approach, a participative, iterative attitude to policy engagement, allows researchers to develop insights that can feed directly into policy discussion. Not only is this at the heart of much of SPRE’s work but also informs the way we train and mentor early\-career and other researchers*’ \[S3\]. 

 **Informing civil society organisations** 

 The National Farmers Union \(NFU\), an apolitical membership organisation representing the interests of 9,000 crofting and farming members, in itself is not equipped to comment extensively on how such governance might or could operate upon leaving the European Union and Common Agricultural Policy \(CAP\). In 2019, and on behalf of CCC, Keating provided a research briefing to the Scottish Parliament on the current scope and practice of policy divergence and convergence under the Common Agricultural Policy, the future of agricultural funding and the possible ways in which it might be distributed after Brexit. NFU drew heavily on his academic analysis stating, ‘ *In its consideration of this important issue, NFUS has engaged with the authors of, and subsequently has drawn heavily from, academic and independent analysis published by the Centre on Constitutional Change \[…\] on the operation of devolution and EU competences after Brexit* \[S4\]. 

 **Providing an effective knowledge base to media outlets** 

 Keating has routinely provided interviews for radio and television, including BBC News \(June 2014\), BBC Radio 4, and BBC Radio Scotland \(Dec 2018\). He has also provided impartial contributions to the national and international press, including *The Scots*man, *The Herald* and *Sunday Herald*, and *The Times*, for their coverage of key issues in his area of expertise \[S5\]. As a result of his skilful ability to communicate his ideas, Keating’s value as an analyst and communicator have been recognised with high esteem by media outlets: 

 ‘*Professor Keating was a regular guest on most of these programmes. He was, and is, valued for several reasons:* 

-  *his impartiality as an analyst \[…\] added credibility to his analysis of constitutional matters concerning Scotland and the interminable twists and turns of Brexit* \[S5\] 

-  *His ability to communicate his ideas \[…\] This is a skill which, sadly, is far from universal. Professor Keating was extremely good at explaining his insights and analysis in a way that viewers and listeners could understand*’ \[S5\]. 

 The accessibility and impartiality of Keating’s research has had an impact on policy through his innovative approach and his ability to provide clear, accessible, and unbiased written and oral evidence. This is evidenced by Keating’s role as official advisor to the Scottish Parliament’s European and External Affairs Committee, and his engagement with governance institutions including the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales, House of Commons, House of Lords and European Parliament, on over fifty occasions. Select examples are outlined below: 

 **Advising the tiers of government** 

 Keating has been identified as an informed but neutral arbiter on vexed constitutional matters, and as such has been a trusted advisor to many of the tiers within the British governmental system as demonstrated below: 

 **Welsh Assembly** In 2016, Keating was engaged by the Welsh Assembly to help develop terms of reference in order to produce best practice principles for inter\-institutional working for constitutional legislation and promote citizen engagement \[S6\]. 

 **Scottish Parliament** In 2020, Keating acted as a witness during a debate on the UK Internal Market Bill to the Finance and Constitution Committee on 16<sup>th</sup> September \[S6\] as well as an advisor to the Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee \[S8\]. 

 **Select Committee on the Constitution** in 2018, Keating provided independent advice on policy co\-operation and co\-ordination, dispute resolution as well as funding the devolved administrations. 

 **Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee** In 2017, Keating gave evidence to the committee \(Devolution and Exiting the EU and Clause 11 of the EU withdrawal Bill: Issues for Consideration\) \[S6\]. 

 **House of Lord Constitution Committee** Evidence presented by Keating and the wider CCC is cited in the Lords Constitution Committee’s report ‘The Union and Devolution’ \(2015\), with direct links drawn between this evidence and the Committee's recommendations on the development and structure of the union. In this instance, his evidence clarified that manifestation of solidarity goes beyond simple redistribution of resources, stating that in a world where citizens are subject to multiple layers of government, from the European Union to the local level, it would be important to build social cohesion “at all levels”. Keating’s evidence clarified that ‘Good inter\-governmental relations should mean that differences in policy or major implementation decisions are made because of the active decisions of each administration, rather than through a lack of consultation and communication.’ As a result, the Committee recommended that the Cabinet Office, as part of its current review of inter\-governmental structures, consider and report on how a revised Joint Ministerial Committee structure might best be used to facilitate joint policy\-making and co\-ordination \[S7\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Standards are a critical feature of contemporary business operations yet, historically, there has been a lack of standards governing professional practise as an emerging field of Human Resource Management \(HRM\). Valerie Anderson’s research has also shown that HRM practitioners currently have a tendency to prioritise responsiveness over process harmonisation and standardisation. Her research argues that as a consequence there is a real need to ensure consistent, coherent and effective HR practices in organisations, and that these objectives can best be accomplished by working with organisations \(national and international\) to transform standards\-setting in the HRM field. 

 Her research has been instrumental in the **development** of new professional HR standards at both the National \(British Standards Institute \[BSI\] national standards for HRM, the Greater London Authority \[GLA\] Good Work Standard\) and international \(International Organization for Standardization \[ISO\] HR standards development\) level **\(Impact 1\).** The growing **adoption** and implementation of such standards across the sector provide further testament to the reach and significance of the impacts resulting from Anderson’s research **\(Impact 2\).** 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Anderson’s contributions in the fields of standards, standardisation, HR strategy and practice, and the value of HR have made her a pre\-eminent expert in applied research into standards in the HR field. Since her appointment at Portsmouth in 2003 Anderson has completed a range of research projects into features of standardisation funded by both the University Forum for Human Resource Development \(UFHRD\) and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development \(CIPD\), including the value of learning \(2007\) and the development of online practice\-based diagnostic tools \(CIPD, 2011\). 

 Anderson’s research adds to the evidence base that shows the importance of coherent HR standards for labour quality, skill development, and organisational performance \( **R1, R2\)**. Yet, many employing organisations do not yet recognise standards as the basis for excellence in HRM practices, her research finding that HRM practitioners choose to prioritise responsiveness over process harmonisation and standardisation \( **R3**\). 

 Her principal contribution to standards development is documented in **R1** \(p.333\), where she advocates employing a principles\-based approach to standards development. In her view this demands a rejection of calls for a strengthening of audit and regulatory processes in order to identify and rectify areas of non\-compliance or ‘token compliance’ \(rules\-based standards\). Instead she proposes the identification of a smaller, core set of principles, ideas, or values that apply more broadly within a profession but which require professional judgement consistent with the intent and spirit of the standard \(principles\-based standards\). Critically too, her research acknowledges that standards development is only the start, rather than the conclusion, of the HRD project, ‘Standards development ….represents an opportunity for those in the HRD field to advocate for learning and development as an important feature of work at individual, work\-group, organisational, and societal levels’ \( **R1**, p.341\). In **R2**, Anderson incorporated the research and authored a chapter on Learning and Development that contextualises the potential for learning and development within the framework of existing Standard provision. 

 The challenges presented by COVID\-19 to organisations and workers have been evident and severe, testing the resilience of firms in all sectors, of all sizes. In an environment that is both increasingly uncertain and rapidly changing, employees are crucial to the resilience and recovery of organisations, particularly smaller organisations. Anderson’s research \(for example **R4**\) critiques assumptions prevalent in larger organisations that regulation and compliance is an appropriate basis for process effectiveness. This links to her earlier research \( **R5**\) in which she outlines how contextual factors such as organisation size and sector are likely to be important influences on the experience of alignment – alignment ‘providing the opportunity for senior managers and HRD executives to share strategic knowledge and information, and for HRD activities and processes to be integrated “horizontally” to encourage, support and direct appropriate action \( **R5**, p.264\). 

 In addressing approaches to standards formulation, both nationally and internationally, Anderson’s research **challenges traditional, compliance and rules\-based approach** to standards\-setting. In its place she advances the case for **principles\-based approaches** to standards in the HRM field, seeing these as providing a more durable base for both **organisational sustainability and individual health, safety and wellbeing.**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Anderson’s research has had a significant **impact upon the development and adoption/implementation of national and international standards in HRM professional practice**. 

 **Impact 1:  Development of new National and International Standards** 

 In January 2014 the BSI invited Anderson to contribute her academic expertise in standards and standardisation to help the BSI Human Capital Standards \(HCS\) Technical committee formulate HRM practice standards. In recognition of her particular expertise Anderson was appointed to the important ‘drafting sub\-committee’ charged with formulating the first HRM standard.  **Anderson’s research provided an initial and highly distinctive contribution to the articulation of the HRM standard as it was agreed by the sub\-committee at the outset that a principles\-based approach, rather than a traditional ‘rules\-based’ approach, would be adopted.** Her central role in establishing the overarching framework that would be employed for the development of the HRM standard *BS 76000 \- Valuing People* in Organisations \( **S1**\) is acknowledged by the other committee members. \[Text removed for publication\], for example, indicates that Anderson *“made an immediate impact on the discussions concerning the creation of these standards. She was an influential member of the drafting committee for BS 76000 and led the group that developed BS PD 76006*” \( **S2**\). \[Text removed for publication\] states Anderson *“was a key member of the drafting committee for the first UK principles\-based people management standard – BS 76000 which set out the principles and requirements for organisations who valued their human capital and wished to demonstrate and evidence to their stakeholders that their people practices were both principled and sustainable*” \( **S3**\). 

 This work was expected to be forward\-looking as standards, by their nature, need to exhibit longevity. HR standards of practice that provide the basis for ethical practise, values workers 'voice and discretion’ in all workplace contexts, CIPD. \(2019\), retrieved from  [<ins>https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/strategy/hr/standards\-factsheet</ins>](https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/strategy/hr/standards-factsheet)\) and ensures business continuity through multidisciplinary, multi\-sectoral and multi\-professional cooperation in the face of emerging social and economic pressures are extremely valuable management tools. 

 **Nevertheless, Anderson’s early research into coaching and strategic alignment** \( **R5**\) **cautioned against a ‘one size fits all’ approach in framing the standard.** Her advocacy of the need for the ‘horizontal integration of HR activities and processes’ \( **R5**\) was instrumental in ensuring BS 76000 provided a framework for “an organisation to create an individually\-tailored management system, or to align existing systems, to realise the full value \(actual or potential\) that people provide to the organisation through their capabilities, knowledge, skills, networks, experience, behaviours and attitudes” \( **S1**, p.1\). **Similarly, her insights into the importance of dialogue/bartering between senior managers and HRD practitioners in influencing strategic thinking and practice** within the organisation \( **R5**, p.275\) found further and wider resonance in BS 76000: *“By establishing a dialogue between the organisation, its people and stakeholders, mutual respect can be fostered to acknowledge the diverse contributions these bring to the organisation and to its shared values and social sustainability”* \( **S1**, ibid\). 

 Following publication of BS 76000 in July 2015, Anderson was appointed as **chair of a BSI committee responsible for developing the Learning and Development guide** \(Published Document \[ **PD\] 76006**\) underpinning BS 76000. The guide was intended to provide ‘useful tools to help tackle organisational learning and development more effectively’, BSI, \(2017\) retrieved from  [<ins>https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030350673</ins>](https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030350673)\), and drew heavily upon the principles\-based approach espoused in Anderson’s research. \[Text removed for publication\] acknowledges that Anderson’s “ *leadership was crucial to the development of the content of BS76006 \(Learning and Development\)*”, content that was directly linked to “ *her expertise and research\-informed knowledge”* and which *“was recognised by other committee members and provided the basis from which to progress the construction of the standard quickly*” \( **S4\)**. Anderson was also invited to scrutinise the drafts of **BS 76005 \(Valuing people through diversity and inclusion: Code of practice for organizations \-** the ‘Diversity and Inclusion standard’\) and recommend revisions and content prior to its publication in April 2017. The media release preceding the release of BS 76005 explicitly acknowledges the principle\-based approach advocated by Anderson \- ‘ *BS 76005 is informed by and supports the principles contained in BS 76000 Human resource \- valuing people \- management system \- requirements and guidance, an existing standard which specifies high\-level strategic requirements for a management system for valuing people’* BSI \(2017\). Retrieved from  [https://www.bsigroup.com/en\-GB/about\-bsi/media\-centre/press\-releases/2017/june/British\-Standard\-for\-diversity\-and\-inclusion\-launched/](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2017/june/British-Standard-for-diversity-and-inclusion-launched/)\) \- and its direct lineage to the HRM BS 76000 panel on which Anderson participated. 

 The centrality of Anderson to the development of BS 76000 and PD 76006 led to her being invited to support CIPD in helping develop the **Mayor of London’s Good Work Standard** \(GWS\) in February 2018. The brief was to draft a capital city standard that would enable London based organisations to \(i\) attract, recruit and retain the best skills and talent; \(ii\) reduce absences and sick leave;  and \(iii\) maintain higher levels of employee engagement and motivation, outcomes which would manifest themselves in increased productivity, cost savings and reputational gain. **Her role was to help develop the standard from ‘where it is now to where we would like it to be’ by creating an initial draft, leading an internal workshop with the Greater London Authority \(GLA\), producing and testing a second version with employers and other key stakeholders, and then developing a final version** \( **S6\)**. The GWS was launched in July 2019, establishing a benchmark that the Mayor wanted every London employer to work towards and achieve. Aimed at employers of all sizes across public, private and voluntary sectors, the GWS Employer Guidance \( **S7**\) produced by Anderson and the CIPD team is linked to an online self\-assessment tool, enabling organisations to seek accreditation and recognition so that they might stand out as exemplary employers. 

 Anderson’s expertise in HR Standards and Standardisation also extends into the international arena following her appointment as Convenor of the Working Group \(ISO/TC 260/WG 11\) to develop **the first International Standard for Learning and Development in Organizations** on behalf of the International Organization for Standardization \(ISO\) Technical Committee \(Human Resource Management\) in October 2018. ‘ *Valerie’s contribution was not just to lead the development of PD 76006 but to build a firm bridge between applied research in the domain and using that to guide practice by professionals. This has been recognised by the international committee of experts from nearly 30 countries in TC260 who approved the proposal from the UK to develop an international standard in L& D helmed by Valerie’ \(* **S3**\). This role enables Anderson to lead the process of agenda\-setting and prioritisation in relation to the development of a global HR standard \(due end 2021\) and is further evidence of how her research is helping to shape the **development** of new professional HR standards at the international level. 

 **IMPACT 2: Adoption/Implementation of Standards** 

 **The Standards that Anderson has helped formulate have impacted directly at organisational level as a consequence of adoption/implementation. This diffusion has taken place through three principal channels:** 

 **First, directly by organisations themselves.** Organisations intent on adopting the BSI standards have purchased them with a view to adoption and certification. Reasons of data protection prevent BSI from releasing the names of purchasing organisations, but \[text removed for publication\] confirms that as at the REF census date BS 76000 Human Resource Valuing People had been purchased by \[text removed for publication\] organisations. BS 76005 Valuing People through Diversity and Inclusion had been purchased by \[text removed for publication\] organisations, and \[text removed for publication\] organisations had purchased BS PD 76006 \- Guide to Learning and Development \( **S5**\). Three examples, drawn from organisations that have adopted the standards in different parts of the UK, serve to illustrate **the local\-level impact and reach of such standards**. \[Text removed for publication\] acknowledges that: “ *the impact of these standards has not just been on the employed workforce … but reaches across our expanding volunteer workforce*”, going on to state ‘ *Adoption of these standards has impacted positively on our strategic and operational achievement’* and ‘ *There is also a wider social impact of these standards through the expansion we have been able to undertake in developing and empowering volunteers, peer mentors and members of marginalised and overlooked communities*’ \( **S8**\). \[Text removed for publication\] \(a medium sized enterprise \[text removed for publication\] specialising in HR support, employment law and employee relations\), was the first to implement BS 76005, indicates that it has led to a ‘ *direct business improvement effect’ as ‘the range of tasks and client services that we can offer has increased’* \( **S9**\). 

 **London\-based organisations do not have to purchase the Good Work Standard, they can simply apply for accreditation using the GSW online self\-evaluation tool**. By end 2020 89 organisations had received accreditation as GWS employers, ranging in size from the Cripplegate Foundation \(10 employees\) and Jewellery Box Ltd \(25\), up to the London Fire Brigade \(5,992\) and the Metropolitan Police \(41,862 employees and an annual budget of GBP3.24 billion.\) 

 **Second, through their widespread acceptance by HRM professional bodies.** The CIPD, the professional body for human resource management and people management with a global membership of 150,000 HR practitioners, confirms that the national Standards developed \(and the international Standards under development\) with the input of Anderson are strategically important to the CIPD vision. \[Text removed for publication\], confirms ‘ *Her work PD 76006 was ground\-breaking in that it codified evidence\-based L&D practices for organisational implementation’*  and that these standards “ *continue to gain steady adoption” with important impacts on “productivity, managerial capability and enhanced workforce welfare*” \( **S3**\). 

 **Third, in facilitating the work of Standards Accreditation and Certification Organisations \(SACO\).** SACO carry out formal, third party recognition and assessment processes of BSI accredited organisations that want independent verification to demonstrate \(to their stake/shareholders\) that they have met the requirements of any given Standard\(s\). One of these SACOs, the \[text removed for publication\], a market leading UK and international accreditation service provider with a portfolio covering more than 2500 companies\), has carried out \[text removed for publication\] UK organisational HR based audits in sectors as varied as NHS Informatics, legal services, construction, education; security and criminal justice; surveyors, training provision; housing association, and charity. In the view of \[text removed for publication\] **the work of Anderson is crucial as it serves to** *“‘raise the bar’ in people management, drive quality and other performance improvements and helps client organisations to win customers, retain staff and build loyalty”  \( **S2**\) **.**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Durham Reading and Exploration \(DREX\) is a computerised training for the rehabilitation of brain injury related visual field defects, which has been converted into an app in order to maximise accessibility and effectiveness. Use of the app increases general vision\-related functioning and thereby confidence, independence, and quality of life. Through an iterative process involving NHS professionals, patients, and carers we addressed perceived barriers to use, and implemented changes that improved usability. With tablets being a more amenable technology to people with limited technical experience, having a multiplatform app has improved the reach of this vital rehabilitative aid, with DREX currently having more than 2,250 registered users.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research involves projects at Durham University during which a computer\-based rehabilitation tool for people with hemianopia was developed, improved, and continuously evaluated. Hemianopia \(partial blindness for one side of space\) is a relatively common consequence of brain injury; approximately one third of stroke survivors have hemianopia, which means it affects more than 30,000 people in the UK annually, and 5,000,000 people worldwide. Treating visual impairments has been identified as a top stroke research priority. The impacts of visual impairment are highly disabling, and sufferers often experience impairments in exploration and reading, significantly reducing their quality of life and their ability to live independently. Limited rehabilitation has been hitherto available and it is important to try and improve therapeutic practices by developing an evidence\-based, maximally effective and easily accessible training, which was the primary research aim overall. 

 Training programmes were developed and evaluated, with a clinical trial comparing supervised exploration training and a control \(2005\-2009\) \[R1\]. This study demonstrated that participants who completed the exploration training showed significantly greater improvements than those in the control group, however there was training specificity \(i.e. reading did not improve after exploration training\). Therefore the training programme was modified to incorporate both reading and exploration training, and was the first training to do this. Furthermore, the training could be completed in an unsupervised manner. A trial was conducted between 2009 and 2012, revealing significantly greater benefits of experimental relative to control training with regards to measures of visual search, reading, and quality of life \[R2\]. 

 This original body of evidence demonstrates that compensatory training for individuals with hemianopia is effective at improving exploration and reading behaviours when trained directly, and can positively impact quality of life. Furthermore, training need not be expensive \(utilising simple computer tasks\) nor time\-consuming \(generally being effective after 1 to 2 months\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 We have created an accessible treatment that works. In 2015 our hemianopia training paradigm was converted into a multiplatform app \(Durham Reading and Exploration; DREX\), such that it can be completed unsupervised on either a computer or a touchscreen tablet. The app has been available for free to download since July 2015 via Google Play, the App Store, and our webpage. End\-users including patients, carers, and healthcare professionals were consulted to understand the facilitators and barriers to using DREX \(2015\-2017\), with their input incorporated via an iterative process to improve the functionality and accessibility of the training package. The DREX app was subjected to a randomised controlled trial \(2015\-2018\), and both computer\- and tablet\-based usage significantly improves search behaviour and reading \[see Figure 1; E1\], in addition to activities of daily living and motivation for rehabilitation \[E1\]. 



 Figure 1: Bar graphs depicting the mean post\-training improvement in a\) visual search, and b\) reading for patients completing DREX on a tablet or computer, as well as a standard care control group. 

 **Many users have reported that DREX has helped them to overcome their visual loss, resulting in drastic improvements in their everyday life**. Example quotes from some of our patient testimonials highlight this further; “The training helps using the remaining vision ability in an effective exploring way and therefore compensates a lot. I’m so grateful for having access to your programme”; “My peripheral vision loss seems to have improved so much I don’t even notice it any more”; “I managed … a review of a 57 page document. The progress is, I am sure, through the focusing exercises I have done through DREX … your software is certainly helping me to reclaim my life” \[E2\]. One of the primary complaints of patients with hemianopia is that they have their driving licence revoked which reduces their independence, and DREX has the potential to overcome this; “My recent field test … showed that my field of vision is now within DVLA standard, thanks largely I think to regular use of DREX” \[E2\]. Furthermore, users indicate improvements in hobbies such as bike riding, archery, cross\-stitch, and reading \[E2\], and often report generalised benefits such as in confidence and attention \(e.g., “I can concentrate more”\) \[E2\]. The user testimonial evidence indicates the positive impact that the DREX app is having on the ability of people to live independently and enjoy their lives with renewed hope. 

 The earlier CD\-ROM version of the training \(discussed in a REF 2014 impact case study\) was requested by approximately 50 people. However, **converting the DREX training into a free multiplatform app has improved its accessibility substantially** by allowing patients from all over the world to take control of their own rehabilitation independently of the research team; **the DREX app currently has over 2,250 unique users**. Furthermore, the unique clinician portal \(with at least 40 current users\) allows healthcare professionals to remotely access patient data, thus personalising care for each patient and resolving a need for cost\-saving efficiency in treatment not reliant on hospital visits. Anecdotal evidence tells us that **DREX users are primarily UK\-based, but we have also reached international users in countries such as the United States of America, Malaysia and New Zealand** \[E2, E3, E4\]. 

 From the very beginning of the app’s development, and during updates since, we worked with patients and healthcare professionals to address barriers such as accessibility, technical expertise etc., to ensure its efficacy is not hindered by peripheral issues \[E5\]. Part of this stakeholder integration included DREX workshops conducted over the summer of 2015, which were attended by 39 patients and 15 healthcare professionals from the North East of England \(Teesside, County Durham, Newcastle, and Northumbria\). 100% of the attendees reported the DREX app as being worthwhile \[E6\] and based on their feedback we created a YouTube channel which includes instructional/informational videos. This has **helped to extend awareness of hemianopia and its rehabilitation** \(for example, one of our DREX YouTube videos has over 900 views\), as well as providing additional support to users. Feedback from a healthcare professional emphasised the value of the DREX informational videos; “It is brilliant because … their curiosity is still piqued by technology but they do lack the skills … It’s really good you’ve got those videos” \[E3\]. The social media and online profiles for DREX also provide a means for users to support one another. For instance, DREX has been shared publicly on Facebook with stroke survivors referring DREX to one another after positive experiences with the training \[E7\]. 

 In order to generate impact, **the work has been communicated via multiple channels including directly to NHS trusts, relevant charities, and also at national and international conferences.** Such activities have increased awareness within both the clinical and patient community of the DREX training tool; “I certainly got a lot from the session and I know the rest of the team did as well” \[E3\], and it is perceived as a helpful tool \(e.g., “It’s really good”, “…everyone is rather excited about having someone to refer visual patients”\) \[E3\]. Feedback from attendees at the UK Stroke Forum \(UKSF\) in 2017 indicated their enthusiasm for DREX \(e.g., “Free app for treating hemianopia\! Not just free but also evidence\-based”\), with comments highlighting some of its features \(“DREX app for hemianopia has a button that allows MDT to log on and see how well their patient are doing”\) \[E8\]. **Healthcare professionals are also sharing knowledge of DREX between one another** as evidenced by example quotes from a UKSF attendee “Will be sharing this with my colleagues\!” \[E8\], and email testimonials, “I will forward the below email to our teamleader so it can be distributed to all our staff” \[E3\]. 

 We are also aware that **healthcare professionals are recommending DREX to patients** in the UK, and that both staff and patients appreciate having the resource available \(e.g., “Thank you for DREX. I am so glad my neurologist suggested it\!\!”\) \[E2\]. Furthermore, DREX is being recommended to patients by clinicians in Malaysia, where low vision hospital practitioners have been using it \[E3\]. Not only that, but some of the assessment tasks built into the app have also been used to extend the assessment practices of these same clinicians; “The optometrist … has used the search assessment from DREX … This is something new for her as there was no such testing done in her hospital” \[E3\]. This indicates that DREX not only has value within rehabilitation, but also in the initial assessment of visual field defects that enables more effective overall management of the condition. 

 **DREX is not only being used as a rehabilitation tool, but also has influenced teaching practice in Malaysia**; “Now I am using DREX for teaching. Introducing final year optometry students to DREX, so that they can use this app at their own practice or hospital in the future” \[E3, E4\]. Furthermore, occupational therapy researchers at **Otago Polytechnic in New Zealand asked to collaborate on a project investigating whether using DREX can provide a vehicle for clinical training and education** about neurological vision impairment. An email excerpt from their lead researcher shows their enthusiasm for DREX, and the potential that they see in the tool; “I am very excited by DREX and I believe that it is the perfect tool to integrate clinical/educational focus that will upskill our clinicians, while providing a real service. I believe that DREX could become the focus of our educational efforts over the next year” \[E4\]. New Zealand is a geographical area notorious for the lack of knowledge and viable rehabilitation options for visual deficits, and so informing therapists of DREX can help to raise awareness. This ongoing project permits verification of the training in New Zealand whilst also continuing to raise awareness about the DREX training tool on another continent. 

 Increased interest in DREX within the stroke and acquired brain injury communities is evidenced by **professionals choosing to include DREX in their publications and amongst their featured resources**. For example, the British and Irish Orthoptic Society \(BIOS\) booklet highlighting the available technology for stroke rehabilitation features DREX, and the app is also included on the Stroke Association’s “My Stroke Guide”, an online platform which provides advice and videos on how to manage stroke recovery \[E9\]. 

 **In short, we have revolutionised the rehabilitation of brain\-injury related visual field defects, increasing patients’ independence, confidence, and vision\-related quality of life.** In the words of one of DREX’s users, “an amazing bit of kit\!” \[E2\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Since autumn 2015, Dr Eleanor Rees has contributed to 50 poetry events benefiting international audiences, women and BAME poets, deprived localities and civic and local events. For Rees, impact does not occur after the event of writing poetry but is intrinsic to the creative process.  Rees’s work enacts an inclusive and non\-dualistic poetics drawing inspiration from recent critical work in new\-materialism and posthuman thought to understand poetry as an emergent phenomenon. Rees’s work repositions the poet as working *within* and *through* their local contexts *as well as* national and international literary traditions. Rees’s work nuances the notion of ‘impact’ itself arguing, through practice, against knowledge production methods which extract value from a system for consumption or sale, and for time and space as flux. Rees’s cultural impact is always social as these are indivisible concepts. 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The impact in this case study is underpinned by the publication of poetry in *Riverine* \(Gatehouse Press, 2015\) and *The Well at Winter Solstice* \(Salt, 2019\), translations of this poetry, and Rees’s practice as a socially\-engaged poet. The eligible poetry collections referenced here enact Rees’s research perspective of a ‘local poetics’, which understands ‘locality’ as an assembly of divergent perspectives rather than a description of sameness. Rees ‘writes with’ and understands poetry as a social and public activity. 

 There is a politics to the problem of the poet in the academy. In the humanities, dualistic thought is privileged over other epistemologies. The dualism of the notion of self and subject which dominates the academy can also be understood as the residue of colonial and humanist ideas which place control and dominance as central to the understanding of what it is to be a writer or thinker \(Braidotti, 2013\). Rees’s poetics challenge this assumption and enact a non\-hierarchical ethics. Her understanding of the ‘lyric I’, and of the self or subject, is that it is dynamically constituted in relation, in ‘intraction’ between body, culture, environment \(Barad, 2007\). In the writing of poetry, Rees must therefore actively engage in these real material dynamics and work with her decentred subjectivity to bring forth poems made from this material. 

 The reading of her poetry to varied audiences is therefore a crucial part of her poetics. The sharing of the poem *is part* of the work of the poet. Seeking to impact, even modestly, upon the consciousness of the listener or reader is the purpose of Rees’s poetics. Rees hopes to persuade a reader or listener to shift their vision and become alert to the vitality of all material. In this way, she hopes to engender an ethics of respect for life in times when this regard is sorely required. 

 Rees’s poetics can be understood within a new\-materialist and post\-humanist philosophy \(that there are no divisions between matter and mind, and man is not at the centre of all thought, that time and space are absolutely and literally in flux\) **.** Rees does not think of poetry as representation. Rees understands poetry as a space which changes energy. Poetry is multivalent. Therefore, the poetic is real. Rees’s practice as research seeks to engage with the problem: Why is poetry not considered thought? Also, why is the material world not understood as thinking? Rees’s work challenges dualistic assumptions in light of her reading in contemporary philosophy. The advances in realist thought grouped under the terms new\-materialism and post\-humanism offer a rigorous context for, paradoxically, her understanding of poetry as thought. Contemporary understanding of what it is to think has shifted and ‘to think’ no longer denotes pure abstraction or logic. Subjects think with bodies, environment *and* abstract capacities. Yet, environs, histories, matter also speak and communicate. Rees’s poetry intuits and then remakes. This poetics requires a new definition of the subject. Rees questions the assumptions present in the discipline of creative writing and the academy which seek to locate the thinking and knowing subject in a stable ‘I’. This knowing subject is expected to know ‘itself’, but the notion of a singular subjectivity is not present in her poetics. For Rees, following Barad and others, the subject or self is multiple, indeterminate and porous \(Barad, 2015\). Any singular experience of self\-identity is contingent, but not real. These ideas are visible in Rees’s impact as a poet in local communities and beyond.

 The quality of Rees’s research to date is evident in the award in 2018 of The Northern Writers’ Award for Poetry 2018 for *The Well at Winter Solstice*. Judged by Queen's Gold Medal winning poet Imitaz Dharker, this prestigious prize for northern writers attests to the connection between Rees’s work and region. £1000 was awarded for the development of the manuscript. 

 The completed book was published with an afterword by Rosi Braidotti in which she writes, ‘Do not let the emotional impact of Eleanor Rees’ poetry mislead you: there’s intense intellectual rigour at work here, as well. The collection pursues a consistent hypothesis, supported by razor\-sharp intuitions. And it builds them up into a sequential clear vision. It is moving on the affective level, but also knowledgeable and conceptually stirring.’ 

 Poet Helen Mort says, ‘Through Eleanor Rees’ shape\-shifting, muscular poems we enter a place where identity is fluid, where surfaces can’t be trusted. A boy in the woods wakes up younger than he was, his body returning to seed. A clock ‘wrings the day dark’. The city is first an empty vein, then a place of abundance and beginnings. These poems stay with you long after reading. They bristle with images that you feel rather than just read: ‘I am in the grass as the trowel rips through… / I am in the water as it strains through earth to sea…’.’ 

 Poet Penelope Shuttle says, ‘These poems probe the edge\-lands of the possible, shifting the scenery of the past. They find their contemporary intent along borders and boundaries, welcoming the ghostliness of such territory, surveying threshold experience, and conjuring\-up the sombre magic of resurrection and of re\-location in time and space. This is a beautiful, grave, and expressive collection.’ 

 Professor Sean Street wrote in international journal *Tears in the Fence*, ‘Together, *Blood Child* and *Riverine* convey seductively cross\-fading time\-scapes; it is in the end this quality that makes these remarkable poems linger in the memory, unsettling and disquieting, redefining so\-called realities. Dark, visceral, her use of language and image is controlled and concentrated, and through it the message is one of connections.’ 

 Poet Nikki Arscot in *Poetry Wales* reviewed *Blood Child* in 2019 and wrote, ‘‘Rees has an outstanding ability to act as a conduit between past and present. It is as though she has tapped into an ancient reservoir ‘remarkable and unsung’ and stepped aside in order for the reader to experience the torrent of its mysterious element uninterrupted by poetic ego or personal agenda.’

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 Rees’s artistic research directly underpins the impact of her work as a poet, working in the wider community and beyond, as attested to by posthuman philosopher Professor Rosi Braidotti in her afterword to *The Well at Winter Solstice*. \(1\) 

 Since 2015, Eleanor Rees has contributed to 50 poetry events benefiting international/national audiences, women and BAME poets, deprived localities and civic and local events. 

 **International and National Readings and Publications** 

 Selections of Eleanor’s poetry have been translated into Slovak, Lithuania, German, French and Spanish. Four pamphlets have been published as a result of the Versopolis EU poetry project and Eleanor has read at four leading International Poetry Festivals \(Paris, Krems, Bratislava, Druskinkai\). For the Pavilion Poets Tour, Eleanor read at 7 national venues funded by ACE. \(2\) 

 **Deprived Localities in Liverpool** 

 Since autumn 2015, Eleanor has run 15 community\-based creative writing activities with The Windows Project. Windows receives funding from Liverpool City Council, Arts Council England, The Big Lottery and others to deliver creative writing workshops in areas of multiple deprivation. These include Walton which is in the 1\-10% most deprived area nationally \(IMD 2015 A Liverpool analysis, Executive Summary, 2015\). Eleanor has run 4 playscheme writing workshops with young people in these areas since 2015. Feedback from one session says, ‘Excellent engagement with children and staff. Children, parents and grandparents always enjoy these workshops, and staff incorporated writing work into an ongoing art project we had running.’ \(Rice Lane City Farm, 2017\). Rees also works on the Writing Advice Desk at Liverpool Central Library. Funded by ALCS and Liverpool City Council, these free two\-hour sessions offer drop\-in on\-the\-spot feedback on creative writing by established local writers. Eleanor has led 9 Writing Advice Desk sessions since autumn 2015 and advised approximately 54 local writers. Rees has also given 2 readings in community venues. 

 Rees is an advisory board member of The Windows Project, providing feedback on applications and advising on diversity strategy for a £49,680.00 ACE bid, which funded 95 workshops and 5 readings, with an estimated attendance of 1,290. \(3\) 

 Rees has also given three poetry readings for Not Just Collective. ‘As a grassroots, self\-funding group, we are committed to a cooperative way of working to build a community of creative practitioners in Liverpool and the wider area. Eleanor's sustained relationship with the collective has both strengthened our cause and opened us up to new audiences.’ \(4\) 

 **Women and BAME Poets** 

 In June\-July 2018, Eleanor worked with The Windows Project and University of Nottingham Centre for Regional Literature to deliver two poetry writing workshops at Liverpool Central Library with local women poets from diverse BAME backgrounds to explore the Windows Project Small Press Archive which is held in the Picton Library. \(5\) 

 **Civic and Local Events** 

 In 2017, Rees worked with The Black Chair Birkenhead Eisteddfod Centenary Festival 2017, a Heritage Lottery Funded Project organised by Wirral Council, Friends of Birkenhead Park and Merseyside Welsh History Society, Ys Ysgwrn. Eleanor led six workshops with an artist, impacting on over 200 Year Six primary school children, their teachers and volunteers in the north\-end of Birkenhead. Rees also gave 2 public readings. ‘All who took part agreed that the outstanding outcome was fostering a real sense of local pride within a community which suffers from high deprivation’. \(The Black Chari End of Grant Report\). Commissioned poem ‘Memorial’ is published in *The Well at Winter Solstice* \(Salt, 2019\). \(6\) 

 The launch for *The Well at Winter Solstice* was held at St Bride’s Church, Liverpool on 21st June 2019, Summer Solstice. The event included the setting of two of Eleanor’s poems to music by leading internationally renowned folk singers and musicians, Emily Portman and Mikey Kenney. The event was attended by over 50 people. Eleanor also collaborated with them on settings of six poems for ‘Poem\-Songs from The Well at Winter Solstice’, Ullet Road Unitarian Church, 21st December 2019. Eleanor also read at five national poetry venues including Stanza International Poetry Festival, St Andrews 2020 as part of the launch activity. \(7\) 

 In 2019, Wirral Borough of Culture commissioned a poem for the handover ceremony to Sefton Borough of Culture. The poem was read by local children to an audience of 700. Testimonial from Wirral Council says, ‘The poem powerfully and creatively explored the themes that each borough had chosen for their year in the spotlight. Following the event, the Mayoress of Wirral requested a copy of the poem and Sefton have expressed their desire to use the poem again during their Borough of Culture year.’ \(8\) Eleanor also led two poetry workshops in primary schools in Birkenhead for the Wirral Borough of Culture and read her poem ‘Memorial’ at ‘Made with Iron’ at Williamson Art Gallery, a celebration of Birkenhead’s shipbuilding heritage. As the evaluation says, ‘Eleanor brought sensitivity and skilful word play and a hush to the room.’ \(9\)

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The World Prison Research Programme gathers, analyses and publishes the best available data on prison populations. Our World Prison Brief data are used in international indices on criminal justice, development and human rights. The data and analysis generated by our research have produced a comprehensive evidence base for penal reform, trusted and used by governmental and non\-governmental organisations worldwide. Our rankings of prison population rates prompt governments to action: between 2015 and 2020 Kazakhstan improved its ranking from 41st place to 100th place with no consequent increase in crime. We have contributed to penal policy in England and Wales and to improved prison management practices globally. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The World Prison Research Programme – underpinned by the  [<ins>World Prison Brief</ins>](http://www.prisonstudies.org/world-prison-brief) database *\(i\)* – seeks to bring about an end to widespread over\-incarceration and its many associated harms. Walmsley and Fair source, analyse, update and publish the best available data on prisoner numbers \(overall, and rate per 100,000 of the national population\) for all countries except North Korea, Somalia and Eritrea \(which don’t publish such data\). Walmsley and Fair provide numbers of pre\-trial, female, foreign national and juvenile prisoners; supplemented with complementary data on official prison system capacity and occupancy rates \(key indicators of overcrowding\), national rankings and trend information, and prison inspection and monitoring reports. 

 Walmsley and Fair thereby provide a solid evidence base for a variety of users to evaluate and inform penal policy and practice with consequent impacts on human rights, public health, justice, security and economic development. Walmsley and Fair produce the *World Prison Population Lists*; and Fair produces the bi\-monthly *International Prison News Digests* \(news relating to prisons and the use of imprisonment around the world\) *.* Fair co\-authored the 3rd edition of *A Human Rights Approach to Prison Management \(iii\)*, a handbook describing internationally agreed standards on imprisonment, with practical guidance on their implementation by prison administrations. 

  

 This body of research data reveals unrelenting growth in the use of imprisonment across much of the world in recent decades. Rapidly rising prisoner numbers and insufficient resources mean prison systems around the world are in crisis. Overcrowded and dangerous prisons exacerbate pre\-existing health and social inequalities. Over\-use of imprisonment is costly and hampers development, while doing little to prevent crime. There is growing recognition that there are better ways to tackle the social problems underlying much offending, and reduce reliance on imprisonment. Several countries with histories of high incarceration rates have adopted policies designed to curb rising prisoner numbers, in many cases informed by our team’s data and research and our collaboration with a large network of civil society reform partners. 

 Between 2017 and 2020 the Programme expanded to research more deeply the causes and consequences of over\-incarceration and strategies to address these, through the project *Understanding and reducing the use of imprisonment in ten countries*. The project was grant\-funded and supported pro bono by several law firms. Fair, Heard and Jacobson investigated the drivers of high levels of imprisonment in ten contrasting jurisdictions, and proposed workable reform strategies. Their research methodology included legal and policy reviews and primary research with input from a range of stakeholders including prisoners and ex\-prisoners, defence lawyers and other practitioners, NGOs and academic researchers. The team examined the framework for custodial decision\-making \(based on local law and policy\). They supplemented their statistical analysis and legal research by qualitative interviews on court decision\-making in practice \(pre\-trial and at sentencing\) and on people’s lived experience of custody from remand to release, both prior to and during the pandemic. Outputs cover: 

  

-  **Learning from changing patterns of imprisonment’** *\(ii\)*. Jacobson, Heard and Fair examined the causes and consequences of rising prison populations in the ten countries, supplementing statistical analysis with accounts of recent trends in each country before setting out strategic recommendations for reducing prison populations in the ten countries and beyond. 

-  **Over\-use of pre\-trial detention** *\(iv\)* which infringes fundamental rights, exacerbates overcrowding, and causes economic and social harm. Heard and Fair identified contributory factors including under\-resourced prosecution and court services and limited alternatives to custody. They made concrete recommendations, including several which are transferable to countries other than the ten in the study. 

 **Penal policies and their public health consequences** *\(v\)*. Heard highlighted links between overuse of imprisonment and poor public health and called for a more health\-informed approach to penal policy. Her research was informed by the two\-day conference she organised in November 2018 – *Mapping inequalities in prisoner healthcare worldwide* – at which health and justice experts from across the ten countries shared their perspectives.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **4.1 Widespread use of World Prison Brief data \(including in international indices\)** 

 The World Prison Brief \(WPB\) provides the definitive dataset on prison systems worldwide. Its website is visited over one million times a year, the number of users tripling from approximately 112,000 to approximately 343,000 between 2013 and 2020. Users originate from 232 countries with high demand from the USA and the Philippines \(see 4.3 and 4.5 below\). Fair’s media monitoring shows that in 2020 our data was cited in 54 English language news articles \(and 59 in other languages\); and 62 policy reports \(including 12 related to Covid, see 4.3 below\) \[ *Sources to corroborate the impact:1*\]. 

 The UN uses our WPB data to measure countries’ progress against indicator 16.3.2 \( *Unsentenced detainees as a proportion of overall prison population\)* of its access to justice target 16.3 corresponding to Sustainable Development Goal 16. WPB data are also used in  [UN Human Development Reports](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data) \(concerning the measure for Human Security\); the  [Global Peace Index](http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/) of the Institute for Economics and Peace \(concerning the measure for Societal Safety and Security\); and by the Association for the Prevention of Torture to measure compliance with the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture. We are a partner database of the  [World Health Organisation](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-determinants/prisons-and-health/data-and-statistics/partner-databases/world-prison-brief-wpb2), who advise that WPB data “ *enables more evidence\-based discussion on ways to improve prison systems*” \[ *Sources:2*\]. 

 **4.2 Support to UN bodies \[redacted\]** 

 WPB data is heavily referenced by the **UN Office on Drugs and Crime \(UNODC\)** which lists the World Prison Brief, and our related ‘ *World Female Imprisonment List’* and ‘ *World Prison Population List’* in more than 200 places on the UNODC website, including: policy papers; country specific pages; citations in specific reports; and as training resources. UNODC uses the World Prison Brief as an example of how comparative data can help governments identify where to focus or to prompt ideas for legal reform *\[Sources:3a\].* 

 \[redacted\] 

 **4.3 Supporting policy and campaigns to address overcrowding and Covid risk** 

 Heard’s prior research on prisoner health *\(v\)* enabled her to respond rapidly to highlight the risks to public health of overcrowding in prisons presented by Covid *\(vi\).* Fair compiled Covid resources for the WPB website, which \(in combination with Heard’s research and the WPB data\) have been widely used to stimulate discussion about the need to reduce prisoner numbers to safeguard wider public health. See for example, calls by Human Rights Watch for prisoner releases in Asia and the Americas \[ *Sources:4a*\]. 

 \[redacted\] 

 In April 2020 Philippines Senator De Lima cited World Prison Brief data \(identifying that the Philippines has the highest level of prison overcrowding in the world\) in her call for the mass release of prisoners during the pandemic. A month later approximately 10,000 prisoners were released and by October 2020, the figure was approximately 82,000 \[ *Sources:4b and 4c*\]. 

 **4.4 Evidence to support reform campaigns** 

 We routinely work with more than 50 civil society organisations and penal reform champions worldwide who draw on WPB data and associated research in their campaigns. Specific examples include Amnesty International report “ [Prison and the pandemic: The lethal cocktail used by the Nicaraguan government against those who criticize them](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/08/carcel-covid19-coctel-letal-gobierno-nicaragua/)”; Human Rights Watch  [World Report 2020](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/world_report_download/hrw_world_report_2020_0.pdf); Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative report  [Responding to the Pandemic: Prisons and Overcrowding](https://humanrightsinitiative.org/download/Responding%20to%20the%20Pandemic%20%20Prisons%20&%20Overcrowding%20Vol%201.pdf); Africa Criminal Justice Reform report  [Women in Pre\-trial Detention in Africa](file:///C:/Users/helen/Downloads/WomenInPreTrialDetention_V2.pdf). A full list of our partner organisations is at \[ *Sources:5*\]. 

 **4.5 Informing better penal policy \(focusing attention on the USA as an outlier\)** 

 The WPB identifies the USA as the country which imprisons the highest proportion of its population. This data is widely cited, including: 

-  April 2015  [speech](https://www.c-span.org/video/?325657-1/hillary-clinton-remarks-criminal-justice-reform) on criminal justice by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton; 

-  June 2016 letter from a consortium of criminal justice reformers to Chairs of both Democratic and Republican parties, to ask that reducing the US incarceration rate be a priority in the policy agendas then being set by both parties. Subsequently the 2016 Democratic Platform resolved to “ [end the era of mass incarceration](https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/protecting-communities-and-building-trust-by-reforming-our-criminal-justice-system/)”, a commitment which persists to date. 

-  2016 report  [<ins>Economic Perspectives on Incarceration and the Criminal Justice System</ins>](https://perma.cc/L7SW-34LH), Executive Office of the President of the United States \[all *Sources:6a*\]. 

 The  [Homeland Security Digital Library](https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&did=755080) refers to our WPB database as “ *a unique resource, offering a foundation for evidence\-based development of prison policy and practice globally*”. 

 The US prison population has been falling year on year since its peak in 2008, thanks in part to prison reformers who use WPB data including: 

-  the  [Prison Policy Initiative](https://birkbeckuol.sharepoint.com/sites/school-of-law/REF/REF%202021/IMPACT%20CASES/MARATHONS/prisonpolicy.org/global/2018.html), referring to our data as “indispensable” and using it to benchmark US imprisonment rates with those of other NATO countries 

-  the Drug Policy Alliance; and 

-  US President Barack Obama who made our data on the incarceration rate one of the key points of his article on criminal justice reform \(Harvard Law Review Jan 2017\) \[ *all Sources:6b*\] 

 **4.6 Influencing penal policy \(Kazakhstan’s drive to reduce rates of imprisonment\)** 

 The Kazakhstan Government was concerned by its poor position in the WPB global ranking of countries with the highest prison population rates \(being 22<sup>nd</sup> in 2010, with 393 prisoners per 100,000 of the national population\). In 2014 the Government developed a plan, ’ *10 Measures to Reduce the Prison Population’*, in collaboration with Penal Reform International and with support from Walmsley. The plan explicitly aimed to take Kazakhstan out of the WPB top 50, and after implementation Kazakhstan progressed from 41st to 67th place between 2015 and 2017; from 67<sup>th</sup> to 93rd between 2017 and 2019; and from 93rd to 100th between 2019 and 2020 \(a prison population rate of 157\). In 2019 the Kazakhstan prosecution authorities stated that the fall in prison population had led to the closure of eight prisons, avoiding unnecessary social harm and saving taxpayers KZT12 billion \(04\-2019\), without increasing crime \[ *Sources:7*\]. 

 **4.7 Influencing penal policy \(England and Wales\)** 

 In July 2017 the \[redacted\] Ministry of Justice invited Heard to brief him and others on how our ten country prisons project could inform prison policy in England and Wales. Copies of her briefing were circulated widely throughout the Ministry. In June 2018 the Government published its Female Offender Strategy, with one of its strategic priorities ‘ *We want to reduce the female prison population’*. The Strategy made many concrete recommendations and commitments that in substance echoed those made in our research *\(ii\)* including diversion of vulnerable people from the criminal justice system; and funding community provision including residential units, as alternatives to custody \[ *Sources:8*\]. 

 In April 2018 the Commission on Justice in **Wales** \(chaired by \[redacted\]\) invited us to advise how Wales could reduce levels of imprisonment; asking us to convene a roundtable of international experts sourced from our network. \[redacted\] The experts’ insights about how their countries had significantly reduced prisoner numbers without increasing \(re\)offending, informed the Commission’s final report. Specifically its conclusion “ *The experience of other nations points very strongly to the need to radically re\-set sentencing policy ... In particular, a much greater use of a more health aligned approach in prison and the greater use of effective community sentences*” references both the roundtable and messages from our research relating to mental health and alternatives to custody *\(ii and v\)* \[ *Sources:9a\]* and resulted in the Commission’s recommendation 14 that sentencing policy be determined in Wales so it can be aligned with health and social policy \[ *Sources:9b*\]. The Government has yet to respond. 

 **4.8** **Informing best practice in prison inspection and management** 

 In 2018 Fair co\-authored the 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of *A Human Rights Approach to Prison Management: Handbook for Prison Staff \(iii\),* over 70,000 copies of which have been distributed to national prison administrations, intergovernmental agencies and NGOs. This edition was produced in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross \(ICRC\), who use it as a benchmark against which to measure conditions when visiting prisons. ICRC encourage prison administrations to use the handbook and to work towards its recommended standards. In 2019 ICRC made over 1,200 prison visits in over 100 countries according to their  [annual report](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/ar2019_facts_and_figures.pdf) \(p.9\). The Handbook is also a free\-to\-download resource in 19 languages \[redacted\] \[ *Sources:10*\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prescribed drug dependency and/or withdrawal affects over 4 million antidepressant and benzodiazepine users in the UK today. No dedicated NHS services exist to help patients who have been substantially affected, while national clinical guidelines have significantly underestimated the extent to which antidepressant withdrawal can be protracted and severe. Research initiated and led by Dr James Davies has shaped the work of the Council for Evidence\-based Psychiatry and the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Prescribed Drug Dependence, resulting in **the first major UK government review of prescribed drug dependence and withdrawal** and a **government commitment to a national** **withdrawal and dependency helpline**, **pledged by the Secretary of State for Health** in 2019. Subsequently, in 2019, the **UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence changed its clinical guidelines on antidepressant withdrawal**, based on Davies’ research findings. Extensive media coverage of Davies’ research has also shaped public debate and understanding of these issues. These health policy changes will improve the lives of up to 1.3 million patients in the UK, who will now be eligible for withdrawal support, while contributing to a significant reduction in the £400 million annual cost to NHS England from unnecessary prescription and consultation.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Mental health issues affect around 1 in 4 people in the UK each year, with 1 in 6 seeking professional help. Since the recent expansion of psycho\-pharmaceutical interventions in the late 1990s, treatment of depression and related mental health issues in the UK has chiefly focused on prescription drugs such as SRRIs, antidepressants and anxiolytics \(e.g. benzodiazepines\), with nearly 20% of the UK adult population being prescribed these drugs in 2019. Since 2011, Davies has led research into withdrawal and dependency associated with each class of drug, playing a fundamental role in changing clinical guidelines and the national response to prescribed drug dependence. 

 In 2012, Davies’ book, The Importance of Suffering: The Value and Meaning of Emotional Discontent \( **R1**\) questioned the dominance of the medical model in mental health provision. Key research findings included that the medical model, supported by the pharmaceutical industry has crowded out effective psycho/social provision in the NHS \( **R2**\), and that the linchpin of the medical model \- the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \- has over\-medicalised social suffering \( **R3**\). Davies’ research argued that professional, cultural and industrial interests have shaped research, practice and regulation throughout the mental health sector, leading to over\-medicalisation and the over\-prescribing of psycho\-pharmaceuticals. These issues were further explored in The Sedated Society \( **R4**\), a volume edited by Davies, with chapters authored by psychiatrists, psycho\-pharmacologists and anthropologists, exploring the socio\-cultural determinants of rising and long\-term psycho\-pharmaceutical prescribing. 

 This qualitative work led Davies and Dr Todd Rae to quantify any harms emerging from over\-prescribing, resulting in a study published in the *British Journal of General Practice* \( **R5**\), which provided the first estimate of the number of long\-term benzodiazepine users in England. It showed that approximately 300,000 such users have been taking benzodiazepines for at least one year, even though the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) \(2009\) guidelines stipulate usage should never exceed four weeks. This study revealed the scale of prescribed benzodiazepine dependency in England. It called for support services \(including a 24\-hour helpline\) and better clinical guidelines to address the problem. 

 Davies, with Prof John Read \(University of East London\), also undertook a comprehensive systematic review into the incidence, duration and severity of antidepressant withdrawal \( **R6**\). The systematic review concluded that the withdrawal reactions when stopping antidepressants are, on average, far more severe, protracted and common than existing UK \(NICE 2009\) and US \(APA 2019\) national clinical guidelines acknowledge. For example, for two decades the NICE guidelines have stipulated that antidepressant withdrawal is ‘usually mild, self\-limiting, resolving over about one week’. In contrast, the Davies and Read systematic review showed that at least half of all antidepressant users experience withdrawal, that around half of these report that withdrawal as severe, and a significant proportion experience withdrawal for far longer than one week – in some cases many months. 

 The study concluded that such inaccurate guidelines were leading many doctors to misdiagnose withdrawal as ‘relapse’ \(the original problem returning\) with drugs being wrongly reinstated. This can partly explain why the average duration of time a person spends on an antidepressant has doubled since the guidelines were first issued in 2004, accounting for rising long\-term use and prescriptions overall \(4.4 million people in England have been taking antidepressants for at least two years\). The Davies and Read systematic review therefore recommended that NICE must revise its national guidelines to better recognise withdrawal, to support patients in withdrawal and to prevent doctors from wrongly attributing withdrawal to relapse \(changes that would also significantly lower prescribing rates\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

1.  **Shaping health policy in the UK: informing Public Health England review and government recommendations** 

 In 2013, Davies presented his research on mental health in the UK Parliament \( **R1**, **R2**\). Following concerns raised by parliamentarians after the sharing of his findings, Davies contributed to the founding of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Prescribed Drug Dependence \(APPG\-PDD\) in 2015, then Chaired by Sir Oliver Letwin MP & Norman Lamb MP. The purpose of the APPG is to liaise with policy makers and government to improve recognition of, and provision for, UK patients harmed by prescribed drug dependency and withdrawal. 

 In recognition of his research, Davies was appointed as the APPG’s Head of Research, and since 2015 has co\-led its secretariat. His research was fundamental to the founding of the APPG, and has also been pivotal in informing the subsequent actions of the APPG by enabling the group to lobby the government using evidence\-based findings to provide support and services for UK patients suffering adverse effects from prescribed drug dependency and withdrawal \( **IMP1**, **IMP2**\). 

 In 2015, the APPG wrote and submitted a report, that was co\-edited by Davies and drew on his research, to the British Medical Association \(BMA\) calling for a review of prescribed drug dependency and withdrawal in the UK. Specifically, the report drew on Davies’ research findings regarding the extent of prescribed drug dependency in England \( **R2**\) to justify the call for support for those suffering dependency and withdrawal. After a series of round\-table meetings, the BMA adopted the APPG’s call for a national prescription drug helpline on October 24th 2016 to tackle prescribed drug dependence in the UK. 

 During these meetings it became clear that the Department of Health would not fund such services \(and helpline\) in the absence of up\-to\-date, evidence\-based estimates regarding the number of long\-term users \(e.g. of benzodiazepines\) in England. In direct response, Davies undertook research into the likely number of such users, publishing his findings in 2017 \( **R5**\) on the advice of Prof Parveen Kumar \(Chair of the BMA’s Board of Science\). The research was widely covered in the media \(e.g. BBC Radio 5 Live, *BBC News, The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Daily Mail*\), with a combined potential audience of 3,132,948 reached via print media; 812,381,768 impressions through online media, with 908 public comments; 5,713,000 reached via radio, and 5,276,000 reached via television \( **IMP3**\). This extensive coverage substantially raised the pressure on public health officials at the Department of Health to address the problem. As the APPG Co\-Chair states: ‘Davies’ research has significantly raised the policy profile of prescribed drugs harms in the UK, bringing essential awareness and coverage to issues that affect millions of people in Britain and beyond’ \( **IMP1**\). 

 In March 2017, the APPG met in Parliament with representatives from Public Health England \(PHE\) and the BMA to discuss background work on overprescribing \( **R4**\), to share Davies’ research findings \( **R5**\) and to present new data on the costs of unnecessary long\-term prescribing in England \(for benzodiazepines £15.2m per year; for antidepressants £44m per year\). The principal outcome of this meeting was an agreement that the research should be presented to Duncan Selbie, Chief Executive of PHE. Representatives from the APPG met with Selbie in September 2017, where they presented the research findings and costings data. This led to Selbie’s agreement that a PHE review on prescribed drug dependence was warranted. The review was formally ratified two weeks later by the then Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt MP. The PHE review into prescribed drug dependency took two years to complete. Davies was appointed to its Expert Advisory Panel and contributed to the PHE Rapid Evidence Assessment, helping determine the review’s scope, the design of its data reviews and systematic analyses, as well as the suitability and outcomes of existing service models. The final PHE report, Dependence and withdrawal associated with some prescribed medicines: an evidence review, was published in September 2019 \( **IMP4**\); its policy recommendations to government were directly based on those called for in Davies’ research \( **R5**\), including: 

-  A 24\-hour national helpline and associated website to provide advice and support for those adversely affected by prescribed drug dependency and withdrawal; 

-  Updated clinical guidance and improved doctor training; 

-  Further research into the nature and severity of withdrawal and its successful treatment; 

-  Appropriate support from the NHS for patients, including dedicated support services. 

 As the Chair of the APPG states: ‘Dr Davies’ research findings into long\-term benzodiazepine use, and the substantial media reporting that followed, played a seminal role in raising the public profile of prescribed drug dependency in the UK and convincing public health officials at PHE to undertake a government review into prescribed drug dependency.’ \( **IMP2**\). His comments are echoed by the Co\-Chair of the APPG: ‘Dr Davies’ research findings regarding the number of long\-term benzodiazepine users in England \(as well as regarding the NHS costs incurred by unnecessary long\-term prescribing of antidepressants and benzodiazepines\) were crucial in launching the Public Health England review into prescribed drug dependency. \[…\] Without the research undertaken by Davies and colleagues this review and its recommendations would not have materialised’ \( **IMP1**\). Following publication of the review, in November 2019 the current Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock MP, publicly announced plans to fund a prescribed drug national helpline, including for antidepressant and benzodiazepine dependency and withdrawal \( **IMP5**\). In October 2020, NHS England and NHS Improvement established a prescribed medicines oversight group. This group will work closely with the APPG to oversee implementation of the NHS recommendations from the PHE review, including the aim to establish a national helpline, and to implement these recommendations by 2021/2022. 

1.  **Changes to national guidelines: national clinical guidelines \(NICE\) and Royal College of Psychiatrists’ official position** 

 During the PHE review, it became clear that there was a significant disparity between what the NICE guidelines stated about antidepressant withdrawal and what a large percentage of patients and grassroots organisations were reporting. To test the accuracy of NICE’s statement that antidepressant withdrawal was invariably mild ‘resolving over about one week’, Davies undertook a comprehensive systematic review of antidepressant withdrawal \( **R6**\). This evidenced that national clinical guidelines \(NICE\) significantly underestimated the severity, duration and incidence of antidepressant withdrawal, leading to increasing long\-term use and rising antidepressant prescriptions overall. Recommendations from the research called for UK national guidelines to be urgently updated to safeguard doctors against wrongly attributing withdrawal to relapse \(leading to lengthening use, rising prescriptions and additional harms\). 

 This research was sent by the APPG to NICE in October 2018. Substantial media coverage of this review \(e.g. most UK newspapers, Sky News; BBC Radio 5 Live; BBC Radio 4’s *All in the Mind*; **IMP3**\) and the significant academic debate that ensued, provided prescribed antidepressant and benzodiazepine users with a voice and increased public and professional support for changes to be made to the guidelines. As the APPG Chair stated in *The Guardian* \(2<sup>nd</sup> October 2018\): ‘This systematic review provides important new data on antidepressant withdrawal… suggesting that existing medical guidelines in this area should be urgently updated to reflect the fact that antidepressant withdrawal is much more common, severe and long\-lasting than previously stated. Furthermore, we hope that other medical bodies will take note of this new research, and update their own guidance accordingly.’ \( **IMP3**\). Following the systematic review and the significant public debate that followed, NICE, after appraising the research \( **IMP6**\), changed its clinical guidelines in October 2019 \( **IMP7**, **IMP8**\), bringing them in line with Davies' research conclusions \( **R6**\), to assert that antidepressant withdrawal can be protracted and severe: 

 ‘Explain that whilst the withdrawal symptoms which arise when stopping or reducing antidepressants can be mild and self\-limiting, there is substantial variation in people's experience, with symptoms lasting much longer \(sometimes months or more\) and being more severe for some patients.’ \( **IMP8**\) 

 Alongside this work with NICE, the APPG also shared the systematic review findings \( **R6**\) with the President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists \(RCPsych\) in November 2018, recommending that the RCPsych change its official position on antidepressant withdrawal to bring it in line with the systematic review’s findings and the agreed changes to the NICE guidelines. RCPsych formally changed its position on antidepressant withdrawal via publication of a new ‘position statement’ in May 2019 \( **IMP9**\). 

 Both the PHE and NICE initiatives affect millions of people in England alone; 7.4 million adults in England were prescribed antidepressants in 2019 \(with over half taking antidepressants long\-term\). Approximately 300,000 people are long\-term users of benzodiazepines, and therefore dependent. The relevant withdrawal support, once established, will span face\-to\-face and helpline provision, and assist up to 1.3 million eligible patients in the UK. As well as the profound human cost of over\-prescribing, the financial cost to the NHS runs into approximately £400 million annually as a result of unnecessary prescription and consultation costs. As the APPG Chair states: ‘By addressing such over\-prescribing as well as revising NICE guidelines we are likely to save the government substantial sums in the coming years via mitigating the costs incurred by unnecessary long\-term use’ \( **IMP2**\). He concludes: ‘Dr Davies’ contribution to achieving a reduction in prescription drug dependence through a change in policy and practice, underpinned by his research findings, is a substantial achievement and a great service for those affected by prescribed drug dependency across the UK.’ 

 Davies continues to investigate the scale of the financial costs of over\-prescribing practices to the NHS in the UK. Through his ongoing contribution to the APPG, he aims to ensure his resultant research findings will inform and influence future assessments of service provisions within the NHS while also informing national de\-prescribing and social\-prescribing initiatives currently being developed in the NHS.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our research significantly shaped the Colombian peace and transitional justice \(TJ\) process, both with regard to the inclusion of third party actors, i.e. those who played a role in the conflict without belonging to the state military or armed groups, and to victim participation. On third party actors, we \(a\) provided analysis which resulted in changes to the jurisprudence of the Colombian Special Jurisdiction for Peace \(SJP\) on the inclusion of third party actors in the TJ process; \(b\) strengthened the work of the influential Colombian civil society organisation \(CSO\) Dejusticia and \(c\) shaped the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights’ report on human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises. 

 We substantially influenced the drafting process of the SJP’s Operational Protocol on Victim Participation by providing recommendations \(which were adopted\) on how to define the scope and reach of victim participation and the measures needed to enable victim participation during COVID\-19, particularly during hearings.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2009, the Essex Transitional Justice Network \(ETJN\), under the leadership of Michalowski and Sandoval, has established itself as an international research hub that produces innovative TJ research to maximise accountability and the satisfaction of victims’ rights in the aftermath of mass atrocities. 

1.  **Accountability of third party actors** 

 In 2010, the ETJN led on a ground\-breaking international research project **\[G4\]** that explored ways to combat impunity of economic actors, such as businesses’ CEOs or directors, for their role in gross human rights violations in times of conflict or repression. The resulting edited collection **\[R1\]** was the first to promote the then novel idea that economic actors should be held accountable through TJ processes. 

 Building on this work, the ETJN and Dejusticia, an internationally renowned Colombian CSO, co\-authored a book **\[R2\]** aiming to improve economic actor accountability in the current Colombian peace and TJ process. It showed how the Colombian Justice and Peace process, a TJ process that started in 2005 and only had jurisdiction over demobilised members of armed groups, but not over third party actors who collaborated with them, resulted in widespread impunity of the latter. The book explained that the impunity gap was caused by the fragmentation of the process, as the TJ tribunals that discovered extensive information about the role of third\-party actors did not have jurisdiction to act on it. Instead, they had to refer the cases to the ordinary criminal courts which encountered significant difficulties to prosecute them, because ordinary criminal law is underdeveloped regarding the complicity of these actors and the burden of proof is stricter. 

 To avoid perpetuating this impunity gap in the current TJ process, based on the Peace Agreement between the Colombian Government and the FARC guerrilla group, the book, a subsequent policy paper specifically written for the SJP **\[R3\]** and two amicus briefs filed in leading court cases **\[R4\]** argued that the SJP’s jurisdiction over third party actors needed to be interpreted broadly to maximise their accountability. These publications established that: a\) the Peace Agreement is not a legally binding source for determining the jurisdiction of the SJP, and its provisions cannot be used to restrict the SJP’s jurisdiction over third party actors; b\) the only element that determines the competence of the SJP over third party actors is that of their direct or indirect contribution to conflict related crimes, whereas the seriousness of their participation in these crimes is irrelevant for determining jurisdiction; c\) the jurisdiction of the SJP is not excluded where a third party actor’s participation in conflict related crimes was motivated by the purpose to gain personal or financial benefits **\[R2, R3\]**; and d\) the SJP needs to differentiate between economic actors already under investigation or who have been convicted in the ordinary criminal courts and those who are not under any criminal investigation, lowering the entry conditions for the latter to incentivise their adherence to its jurisdiction **\[R3\]**. 

 Applying research findings from the Colombian experience to the wider question of how to achieve economic actor accountability in TJ contexts, **\[R5\]** argues, inter alia, that TJ tribunals should be given jurisdiction over economic actors; that businesses that acted lawfully but benefited from conflict\-related crimes should be strongly encouraged to engage with truth and reparation mechanisms and that one form of guarantees of non\-recurrence would be for States to introduce corporate criminal liability. 

1.  **Victim participation** 

 The ETJN has conducted significant research on the right to reparation for victims of international crimes, including how to operationalize it in TJ processes **\[R6\-R8\]**. It has maintained that victims have a human right to participate in justice and reparation proceedings and to be consulted about them. Research carried out under **\[G3\]** has demonstrated the importance of such participation, in particular in relation to judicial hearings and their significance for the effective implementation of reparation measures **\[R6\]**. The findings of our fieldwork also allowed us to consider ways to foster victim participation in TJ mechanisms **\[R7, R8\]**, including for victims in a situation of vulnerability, such as victims of sexual violence **\[R7\]** through confidentiality and camouflage measures. The research also considered the implications of Covid\-19 for victims’ participation in Colombia before the SJP, particularly when carrying out judicial hearings. To foster their participation before the SJP during the pandemic, we recommended ‘compensatory measures’, such as providing additional time for filing arguments or views with the SJP. 

 Under **\[G1\]**, the ETJN coined the concept of “integral participation,” linking it to the Inter\-American Court of Human Rights’ concept of ‘integral reparation’ \(reparación integral\). We put forward the view that meaningful participation goes beyond effectiveness, an existing standard in international law that is not in itself sufficient for victims. **\[R8\]** adds to this that participation should also be accessible; based on adequate and timely information, must be gender and culturally sensitive and grounded in dialogical processes. Victims also need two enabling measures: access to adequate legal representation and psycho\-social support.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **1. Accountability of third party actors** 

 The ETJN research on third party actors has benefited \(1\) Dejusticia, \(2\) the SJP, and \(3\) the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights. 

  1.  **Shaping Dejusticia’s work on third party actors** 

 Our research has significantly informed the work of the influential Colombian CSO Dejusticia which, in collaboration with the ETJN, has been positioning itself as a crucial player in the debate on how to integrate third party actors in the Colombian TJ process. Sustained academic guidance from the ETJN has shaped Dejusticia’s approach to this issue. It resulted in a joint ETJN/Dejusticia research and impact agenda to maximize the accountability of economic actors. The effectiveness of our collaboration is evidenced by joint academic publications **\[R2\]**, policy papers **\[R3\]**, externally funded projects **\[G1\]** and amicus briefs to the SJP **\[R4\]**. According to the co\-ordinator of the TJ area of Dejusticia, the amicus briefs “ *had … impacts in the decisions itself*” as well as creating “ *interest of the Jurisdiction in the research*.” **\[S1\]**. He emphasised that: “ *Professors Michalowski and Sandoval have contributed enormously to our capacity to work effectively on this issue. … Their skillset has allowed us to achieve three objectives: conduct innovative research, use that research to inform our legal and institutional analysis, and finally, carry out an effective dialogue with policy makers and other concerned political and institutional agents. This collaboration has enabled Dejusticia to develop its work and reputation in this area*” **\[S1\]**. 

  1.  **Influencing the decisions of the SJP on third party actors** 

 Our research has led the SJP to adopt an inclusive approach to exercising its jurisdiction over third party actors. 

 **Decision of the Appeals Chamber of the SJP in Char Navas** 

 In April 2018, a Chamber of the SJP issued the first decision on its jurisdiction over third party actors, interpreting the applicable legal framework to restrict considerably the SJP’s jurisdiction to adjudicate the conduct of third\-party actors. In response, the ETJN and Dejusticia jointly filed the only civil society amicus curiae brief before the Appeals Chamber of the SJP **\[R4\]**, drawing heavily on **\[R2\]**. Despite highlighting that the two institutions did not have formal standing to file an amicus brief, the Appeals Chamber “ *consider\[ed\] it pertinent to allude to their intervention, given its usefulness and the academic prestige of both institutions*” **\[S2**, para.3.3.2, fn.64 **\]**. It then summarised **\[S2** para.3.3.2 **\]** and adopted some of its key arguments in its judgment. Consistent with our submission, the Appeals Chamber held that the first instance chamber had excluded third party actors from the SJP based on a mistaken interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions **\[S2**, paras 13.3\-13.4, 13.8\-13.10 **\]**. As we had argued, the correct approach was to recognise that third party actors could adhere to the SJP, whether or not their role in conflict\-related crimes was primarily driven by economic motivations **\[S2**, paras 13.3, 13.7, 13.10, 13.12, 13.14, 13.22 **\]** or reached the highest level of responsibility for the commission of the crimes **\[S2**, paras 12.3, 12.5\-12.6 **\]**. 

 The change in the SJP’s approach facilitated by our amicus brief has informed subsequent cases. Had the first instance decision not been overturned, this would have seriously undermined the Colombian TJ process that was designed to fight impunity of, and provide comprehensive closure for, all actors of the conflict, as many third party actors participated in conflict related crimes for their economic benefit **\[R2\]**. As a result, these actors can and are seeking access to the SJP \(over 500 so far\) to make use of its benefits in exchange for providing victims and society with truth and reparations. 

 **Interpretative Decision No.1 of the Appeals Chamber \(SENIT 1\)** 

 In December 2018, the Appeals Chamber of the SJP specifically invited the ETJN as one of two international university research hubs, to provide observations prior to issuing an interpretative decision. The decision **\[S3\]** followed the ETJN’s joint intervention with Dejusticia **\[R4\]** regarding an important issue left open in the decision in Char Navas: how much detail on their contributions to truth and reparation third party actors need to provide in their plan that needs to accompany an application for access to the SJP. The Appeals Chamber adopted our arguments **\[based on R2 & R3\]** that a\) this plan must not create a disincentive for adhering to the SJP **\[S3**, paras 147, 205, 206, 209 **\]**; b\) a distinction needs to be made according to the procedural situation of the third party actor in the ordinary jurisdiction when determining what contributions to the transitional justice process can be required of him/her, with third party actors without proceedings in the ordinary jurisdiction only having to contribute truth but not having to assume criminal responsibility or contribute to reparation **\[S3**, paras 147, 227\-230, 292 **\]**; and c\) those without any proceedings can have access without any prerequisites where this is necessary to incentivise their adherence **\[S3**, para 293 **\]**. In providing maximum incentives to third party actors to adhere to the SJP, this differentiated approach ultimately enhances the rights of victims. 

  1.  **International impact** 

 The ETJN’s research on economic actors in the Colombian TJ process has significantly influenced the approach of the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights \(UNWG\) on economic actor responsibilities in conflict, post conflict and transitional justice settings. Based on Michalowski’s internationally renowned research on linking business and human rights with TJ **\[R1\-R3\]**, she was invited by the UNWG to make a submission to inform their report to the UN General Assembly. Six of the 15 paragraphs of the report dealing with TJ almost verbatim adopt the ETJN submission that draws heavily on **\[R1\]**, **\[R2\]** and **\[R3\]** **\[S4\]**. A member of the UNWG, confirmed that: “ *In our report, we adopted most of the points made in her \[Professor Michalowski’s\] submission to our consultation*” **\[S5\]**. They highlighted, in particular, the adoption of our arguments that \(a\) all pillars of TJ represent a form of remediation and should be recognized as an inherent part of the remedy pillar of the UN Guiding Principles, and become a guidepost for how States design transitional justice processes that account for the role of business \(para.85\); \(b\) TJ tribunals should be given jurisdiction over all actors of a conflict, including economic actors \(paras.88\-89\); \(c\) where economic actors incur criminal liability, their obligation to provide remedies goes beyond symbolic reparation \(para.89\); \(d\) symbolic reparations need to be designed from a victim perspective \(para.89\); \(e\) businesses that benefited from conflict should be strongly encouraged to engage with truth and reparation mechanisms \(para.90\); \(f\) States should consider introducing corporate criminal liability as a guarantee of non\-recurrence \(para.91\) **\[S4\]**. 

 According to the UNWG member, who is a law professor, “ *Professor Michalowski’s research carried out as part of the ETJN at the University of Essex, significantly shaped the UN Working Group’s report on transitional justice and business and human rights, which is expected to influence future UN approaches as well as state and business practice on this matter*.” **\[S5\]**. 

 **2. Victim participation** 

 The ETJN’s research on victim participation has significantly shaped the work of the SJP through close collaboration with its Commission on Victims’ Participation during the drafting process of its Operative Protocol on Victim Participation to be used by all staff at the SJP, by victims and relevant stakeholders. Upon the Commission’s request **\[S6\]**, the ETJN drafted two of the chapters of the Protocol: \(1\) General principles on Victims’ Participation and \(2\) Guidelines on Holistic Participation of Victims in the written and oral proceedings before the SJP. They further advised the SJP on challenges and limitations of the use of digital technologies in times of COVID\-19, which also influenced the drafting of annex 1 to the Manual on guidelines for victims’ participation through such technologies **\[S6\]**. 

 Following our research **\[R6\-R8**\] and the draft chapters we presented to the SJP, the Protocol included our concept of integral rather than just effective participation **\[S7**, p.27 **\]** and followed our suggestions on how to design it **\[S7**, p. 122, 264 **\]**. Our recommendations for compensatory measures **\[R8\]**, such as additional opportunities to present pleadings in writing during Covid\-19 restrictions, were also incorporated **\[S7**, p. 323, 324, 344 **\]**. 

 As stated by Justice Roberto Vidal, Chair of the Commission on Victims’ Participation, “ *Professor Sandoval’s influence at the SJP has materialised in \[these\] two key chapters of the Manua*l” **\[S6\]**. Furthermore, the Manual, launched by the SJP in November 2020, expressly indicates that the Commission on Victims’ Participation at the SJP “ *thanks \[…\] national and international experts that contributed to the richness of this document, and especially to the Essex Transitional Justice Network*…” **\[S7**, p.16 **\]**. 

 Sandoval’s influence on the drafting of the Protocol was recognised publicly by the National Attorney’s Office, represented by the Special Attorney for the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, who at a high level panel organised in June 2020, referring to Sandoval, stated that: “ *You are really an expert on victims’ participation and reparation in contexts of transitional justice, and I am an eye witness of the way you have accompanied the SJP with very important recommendations on victims participation*” **\[S8**, minute 39:13 onwards **\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research carried out in the Department of Chemistry led to the first quantitative, single\-base resolution sequencing of the two most important epigenetic modifications of DNA, 5\-methylcytosine and 5\-hydroxymethylcytosine. The discovery of oxidative bisulfite sequencing \(OxBS\-seq\) led to the spin\-out company, Cambridge Epigenetix, which has made the technology commercially available worldwide. Cambridge Epigenetix as of early 2020 had raised GBP40,000,000 \(USD56,500,000\)  in pre\-revenue funding and currently employs around 35 staff. The OxBS\-seq technology is transforming our understanding of the role of the epigenome in disease and has led to a new non\-invasive diagnostic kit for widespread cancer screening.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **Epigenetics.** In the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, there was growing realisation of the role of DNA methylation in physiological and pathological conditions, and the mechanisms by which DNA methylation profiles were inherited through generations. However, the study of these epigenetic modifications in health and disease was hindered by the lack of any high\-throughput or quantitatively accurate approaches for characterizing them. It had been shown that the epigenetic mark 5\-methylcytosine \(5mC\) plays an important role in genome stability and gene silencing. Furthermore, it was known that 5mC could be oxidized to 5\-hydroxymethylcytosine \(5hmC\) by the ten eleven translocation enzymes, raising the possibility that 5hmC could be an important intermediate in DNA demethylation or an epigenetic mark itself. Although 5hmC in mammals had been detected, the state\-of\-the\-art sequencing technologies of the time were limited in that they could neither distinguish between 5hmC and 5mC, nor give quantitative information. 

 **Oxidative bisulfite sequencing.** Professor Balasubramanian had already developed the world’s most powerful next generation sequencing technology, Solexa Sequencing, which has revolutionised the field of genomics, and he now turned his attention to epigenetics. He teamed up with a world leader in the field, Professor Wolf Reik, who was working at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge and had discovered key epigenetic mechanisms important for mammalian development, physiology, genome reprogramming, and human diseases. Together they set about developing sequencing techniques that could detect the two most common epigenetic modifications, 5mC and 5hmC, at single\-base resolution. The exploratory research carried out in the laboratory of Professor Balasubramanian in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge led to the development of the technique called oxidative bisulfite sequencing \(OxBS\-seq\), which allowed for the first time the detection of both 5mC and 5hmC to single\-base resolution. The initial results were obtained with synthetic DNA, then in collaboration with Reik, with genomic DNA from mouse embryonic stem cells.\[R1\] This 2012 study demonstrated a high level of 5hmC within specific areas of the genome associated with transcriptional regulators, suggesting these regions may play a role in epigenetic reprogramming in embryonic stem cells. 

 **Exploitation.** Balasubramanian went on to optimize the sequencing methodology, improving the purification steps and the formulation of oxidant, giving greater stability and reproducibility.\[R2\]  In 2014, he developed a new method to quantitatively sequence a third epigenetic modification, 5\-formylcytosine, in both synthetic DNA and that of mouse embryonic stem cells at single\-base resolution.\[R3\] These new sequencing methods allowed the epigenetic code of DNA to be mapped at high resolution for the first time, at a crucial period when the significance of epigenetics in health and disease was becoming apparent. The next step was to commercialise the technology and make it available for the wider genomics community in academia and the healthcare industries. The implication being that better understanding of the epigenome enables its role in disease mechanisms to be elucidated, and that specific markers could be exploited in novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. Balasubramanian protected the OxBS\-seq technology with a series of patents and founded a company, Cambridge Epigenetix, to exploit his discoveries.\[R4,R5\]

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Cambridge Epigenetix.** In 2012, Balasubramanian co\-founded Cambridge Epigenetix to commercially develop OxBS\-seq. In 2013, the company launched their first product, TrueMethyl™ OxBS kit, which provides reproducible and accurate analysis of 5hmC and 5mC.\[E1\] Since DNA from cancer cells has a distinct epigenetic signature, this technology has formed the basis of epigenetic tests in cancer diagnosis. With their first kit on the market, Cambridge Epigenetix underwent three successful rounds of venture capital funding, raising USD5,500,000 in 2014, USD21,000,000 in 2016, and USD30,000,000 in 2018.\[E2–E4\] This investment has allowed the company to further develop a range of tools for epigenetic analysis. The company is currently located at Chesterford Research Park and employs around 35 staff.\[E5\] Balasubramanian is chair of the Scientific Advisory Board and a member of the commercial board.\[E1\] 

 **Products on the market.** In 2016, Cambridge Epigenetix launched their New TrueMethyl™ Whole Genome kit.\[E6\] This system includes all\-in\-one reagents for sample conversion, library creation and indexing, combined with bioinformatic tools to enable accurate DNA modification analysis, reducing costs and improving accessibility of bisulfite sequencing for researchers. In 2017, Cambridge Epigenetix and NuGEN Technologies entered into a partnership agreement to integrate the oxBS\-Seq technology with next generation sequencing library preparation kits.\[E7\] The signing of the agreement enabled Cambridge Epigenetix to focus on its epigenetic biomarker discovery programmes, both in\-house and in partnership with leading biopharma companies. 

 OxBS\-Seq is being used by researchers in academia and industry to study the importance of DNA \(hydroxy\)methylation in biological mechanisms and in disease for various fields that include cancer biology, development, stem cell research, and neuroscience. The technology being developed at Cambridge Epigenetix is advancing the possibilities for medicine well beyond the realms of the genome, bringing a new generation of diagnostic and therapeutic innovations that offer hope for many patients living with life\-threatening diseases. Abnormal patterns of DNA methylation have been identified in a number of aggressive cancers, as well as inflammatory, metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. 

 **Cancer diagnostics.** In 2019, Cambridge Epigenetix launched a discovery and development programme for an epigenetic test to detect colorectal and other cancers from a simple liquid biopsy to analyse circulating free DNA in the blood stream.\[E8\] These new diagnostics kits provide a significantly less invasive procedure for cancer screening that does not require tissue samples. The company was granted broad and exclusive patent rights for the use of 5hmC as a diagnostic biomarker for cancer.\[E8\] The first studies analysed over 2,000 patient samples, including healthy volunteers, and individuals with adenomas and all stages of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is expected to increase by 60% to more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.1 million deaths by 2030, and its diagnosis remains a challenge.\[E8\] As a Cambridge Epigenetix Clinical Advisory board member states ‘the availability of a non\-invasive, easy\-to\-administer and affordable screening test as our first initiative could transform the diagnosis, detection and treatment of pre\-cancerous lesions and CRC.\[E8\] 

 Cambridge Epigenetix CEO claims “ *Our ability to detect 5hmC in circulating, cell\-free DNA, and the discovery and development of a liquid biopsy signature for tumours, could revolutionise cancer care and decrease cancer mortality through widespread screening, early detection and timely intervention. I am excited to lead the talented team at Cambridge Epigenetix for the development and launch of the first of many tests to detect cancer*”.\[E8\]

Finding ways to combat hate speech and form counter\-narratives against it has been identified by the Council of Europe as a priority for education, communication and policy. Federico Faloppa is an established expert on hate speech, both through his research and as a public commentator and advisor. In the past decade he has informed public debate in Italy through his contributions in national media and over 130 public talks and workshops; trained media professionals and NGOs’ activists, inspired a play and an anti\-racist communication campaign and informed the policies and practices of non\-academic stakeholders. Faloppa has changed attitudes and behaviour relating to hate speech in Italy and beyond. Through collaborations with a range of organisations, in particular Amnesty International Italy and the Council of Europe, Faloppa is influencing the changing attitudes towards hate speech. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Faloppa’s research has set the tone in Italy for the debate on the linguistic representation of “otherness” in language across the centuries, and the everyday use of derogatory expressions towards minorities. Faloppa’s research has explored the way language can stigmatise people, not just from an historical point of view but in current narratives and discourses. This has included studying events from the 1990s and early 2000s, looking at representations of foreigners and migrants in the popular media \(output 1\). 

 Faloppa was Co\-investigator in the Leverhulme Trust\-funded International Network “Destination Italy *.* Representing migration in contemporary media and narrative” \(2010\-2012\) *,* on the discourse of migration in literature, cinema and the media, leading the strand on the media. He co\-edited the project’s publication \(output 2\) including his own chapter “Media and migration: some linguistic reflection *s”*, on the portrayal of migrants by the Italian media, in which he suggests linguistic inaccuracies led to negative framing of migrants. 

 In 2017, Faloppa was a Co\-investigator on the ESRC\-funded project “ProLanguage – The role of language in global migration and mobility”. This project involved academic institutions and NGOs from seven different countries and brought Faloppa and colleagues to refugee settings in Greece, Italy and Lebanon, to investigate how language\-teaching was provided in camps. As a continuation of this project, and to work on counter narratives and alternative narratives on migration, in 2018 Faloppa started a research project supported by the Centre for Literacy and Multilingualism at the University of Reading to explore the use of languages in “Borderscapes” across Europe. As a result, Faloppa curated a photographic exhibition of the work of Luca Prestia, exhibited in Reading Public Library in 2018 and subsequently in five public locations in Italy. The exhibition catalogue was published in 2019 \(output 3\) and has been developed further for a co\-authored monograph *Oltre il confine. Da Ventimiglia a Lesbo, scatti, parole e segni dalle frontiere d’Europa* \(output 4\). 

 Faloppa has produced a number of popular publications based on his research, to help reach as wide an audience as possible. He was invited to contribute to *Contro il razzismo*. *Quattro ragionamenti* \(output 5\) published in 2016 by Einaudi and translated into Spanish, which is now used as a textbook in many university courses in Italy. 

 Faloppa’s most recent monograph \(output 4\) is the pinnacle of his research on hate speech, and currently is the most comprehensive publication on this subject available in Italian. For this reason, has received extensive media coverage since its release. This body of research is fundamental to Faloppa’s training methods and has contributed to his significant public profile in Italy as a leading academic on linguistic manifestations of racism and hate speech. In July 2020 Faloppa was awarded a University of Reading GCRF grant worth 48,000 GBP to develop a project for combatting hate speech in Bosnia Herzegovina.

 **3. References to the research** 

 The research meets or exceeds the threshold for 2\*: it has been published in peer\-reviewed volumes with established academic presses. Outputs 1, 5 and 6 are important points of reference and regularly feature as key readings on numerous university courses on history of Italian language, Italian sociolinguistics, and anthropology and migration studies. Output 6 is the primary point of reference on “racism in language” available in Italian and output 1 is an essential point of reference on hate speech available in Italian, serving as a catalyst for new thinking and policies on hate speech.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Faloppa has played a significant role in raising awareness in Italy of endemic hate speech and the origin, use and persistence of everyday racist language. He has trained journalists, teachers and representatives from trade unions and NGOs – whose work can influence language use at grass roots level – to change their perceptions of language. This has helped them understand the historic precedents for why their language is biased, if not racist. As a well\-known expert engaged in combating hate speech in Italy, Faloppa was invited to be a leading figure in Amnesty International Italy’s and “Alexander Langer” Foundation’s strategies against hate speech, bringing about change in attitude and understanding within these organisations and in the public sphere \(E1\). 

 **A. Grass\-roots training for behaviour and attitudinal change.** 

 Faloppa’s initial target group for training was journalists, focussing on the representation of minorities and foreigners across the press and media. Since 2014, he has worked with the professional association “Carta di Roma”, which trains journalists as part of continuous professional development. Through this collaboration, Faloppa has reached approximately 500 journalists and media professionals \(2017\-2019\), many of whom have commented that it has made them reconsider their use of language. Key to these changes is that Faloppa at no point has proposed to censor their language, just to take a more considered approach to why they are using the language they choose \(E2\). 

 Together with Dr William Allen \(COMPAS – Oxford\) Faloppa has brought this training model to the UK as part of an ESRC IAA grant “Media Use and Representation Among Migrants: Developing a New Agenda” \(2019\). A workshop to discuss the media consumed by refugees living in the Oxford and Reading areas and involving local NGOs and journalists, was held in March 2019. This helped identify how refugees might be reached most effectively so they could help create their own counter narratives. Unfortunately, follow\-up events planned for 2020 were cancelled due to Covid\-19. 

 In the past ten years, the training sessions have been delivered to NGOs including 1\) NAGA Milan \(2013\), 2\) Carta di Roma \(2014\-ongoing\), 3\) Fondazione “Alexander Langer” Stiftung \(2016\-ongoing\), 4\) Amnesty International Italy \(2017\-ongoing\), 5\) COSPE Onlus Florence \(2018\-ongoing\), 6\) Emergency \(2019\). In all cases, Faloppa has helped the organisations create and support training for their own members, clients and civil servants and informed their internal policies and strategic planning \(E1\-4\). 

 **B. Organisational involvement for behavioural and attitudinal change:** 

 Faloppa’s research is recognised internationally and he has become a principal player in several organisations, as they aim to deal with issues of race, language and migration in the media. He has worked with the Alexander Langer Foundation in Bozen, serving on its scientific committee since 2017, and he was nominated Deputy President of the Foundation in 2018, in recognition of his contribution to combating hate speech in the media. His work has made a significant impact on the Foundation’s programmes and priorities \(E3\). 

 Since 2017, Faloppa’s research on “racism in language” and hate speech offline and online has been embedded in Amnesty International Italy’s practices and activities and has informed all Amnesty\-badged training activities. Faloppa’s collaboration with Amnesty International Italy has stemmed from his training activities and has been a significant avenue for bringing about attitudinal and behavioural change \(E4\). The two main training events that sparked the collaboration were th *e* design and delivery of CPD workshops for journalists in  [Palermo on 22 April 2017](https://www.cartadiroma.org/formazione/formazione-continua/migrazione-linguaggio-formazione-palermo-21-aprile/) \(100 participants\) and Catania on 13 March 2018 \(150 participants\). Following this, Faloppa was invited to deliver a keynote talk at  [Amnesty Italy’s AGM](https://www.amnesty.it/caserta-dal-20-al-22-aprile-la-xxxiii-assemblea-generale-amnesty-international-italia/) in Caserta on 21 April 2018 \(to 400 delegates\). In 2018, Faloppa was invited by Amnesty Italy to become a consultant to support their work, initially from October\-December 2018. This included setting up and co\-ordinating a national network of thirty experts on hate speech and counter narratives, including representatives from research centres, universities, organisations, and NGOs, seven national meetings chaired as national coordinator so far \(E4\). 

 Under the umbrella of Amnesty Italy, Faloppa has continued to deliver a series of training courses, workshops and talks including trainings for Amnesty activists involved in the project “Task force hate speech” \(Rome 2018\-2020, approximately 100 activists\); workshops for activists at  [Amnesty summer camps ](https://d21zrvtkxtd6ae.cloudfront.net/public/uploads/2017/03/28181005/Programma-Lampedusa-agosto-2018.pdf)\(Lampedusa 2018 and Camini 2020, approximately 100 participants\); CPDs for lawyers \(Florence  [2018](https://www.fondazioneforensefirenze.it/uploads/fff/files/2018/2018_11%20-%20Novembre/09%20-%20Discorsi%20di%20odio/Programma%2009_11_2018.pdf), 150 participants; Verona 2019, 100 participants\); public talks at Amnesty local branches \(Milan and Ravenna 2019, approximately 150 participants each session\); Three master classes for the HE certificate in “Migration and reception of migrants” at the prestigious ISPI – Istituto per gli studi di politica internazionale \( [Milan, March 2019](https://www.ispionline.it/it/ispi-school/advanced/professional-certificate-ad-electoral-assistance), 30 selected students; November 2019, 25 selected students; March 2020, 25 selected students\) and a training session for Amnesty’s officers from Emilia Romagna and Tuscany \(Piacenza 2019, 80 participants\) \(E5\). 

 In March\-June 2019, Faloppa contributed to design a monitoring activity, involving 200 activists, on the presence of hate speech in the European Election campaign, and testing and evaluating the IT platforms and apps designed for the survey. He then wrote a report to summarise Amnesty’s monitoring activities since 2018, “Un anno di odio. Dalle politiche del 2018 alle europee del 2019” \(“A year of hatred. From general elections in 2018 to European elections in 2019”\), published in Amnesty International Italy, “Il barometro dell’odio – Elezioni Europe *e”*, July 2019\). In 2019, Faloppa also wrote the introductory paper “Il linguaggio dell’odio. Continuità e innovazioni” \(“The language of hatred: continuity and innovation”\) for Amnesty’s 2019 monitoring activity, “Il barometro dell’odio – Sessismo da tastiera *”* \(April 2020\). 

 Faloppa’s impact on Amnesty Italy itself has been to influence and set the organization’s agenda on hate speech and discrimination through language. As a result, and “in recognition of the high impact” of his research and given his “national and international esteem”, the Director of Amnesty Italy has invited Faloppa to lead a new “Centre of excellence” on hate speech \(to be launched in 2021\) and of the “ [Rete nazionale di contrasto ai discorsi e ai fenomeni d’odio](https://www.retecontrolodio.org/il-coordinamento/)”, which was launched on 14 July 2020 \(E1, E6\). These roles include: coordinating twenty\-five organizations and several individual researchers and activists across Italy; establishing a research agenda; coordinating research, educational and impact activities and providing Amnesty’s campaign office with input for innovative communication campaigns based on research. The influence reaches beyond the organisation itself, with an audience of a\) 2,000 Amnesty activists; b\) 70,000 members of the organisation; c\) local communities and stakeholders; d\) the wider public in Italy and beyond, through Amnesty’s press office. The Rete nazionale is establishing itself as the most authoritative research and campaigning hub on hate speech and counter\-narratives nationwide and will liaise with Amnesty branches worldwide with the purpose of setting up and spreading best practice for the whole organisation across the globe. In June 2020 Faloppa renewed his consultancy contract with Amnesty, to push forward the Rete nazionale and provide Amnesty with original research on hate speech and discourse of exclusion post Covid\-19, which will contribute to the organisation’s campaigning aims in 2021 \(E7\). 

 In recognition of his expertise and influence, in 2018 Faloppa was appointed by COSPE Onlus as the European evaluator of the project Silence Hate funded by the European Union’s Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, involving COSPE, European federation of Journalists \(EFJ\), Media Diversity Institute \(MDI\), Amnesty International Italy, Amnesty International Poland, KARPOS, Zaffiria, Cyprus Community Media Centre \(CCMC\), and IKME\- Socio\-political Studies Institute \(E8\). 

 He has since been appointed as one of six independent experts to the new Committee of Experts on Combatting Hate Speech \(ADI/MSI\-DIS\) at the Council of Europe – the most authoritative institutional committee in Europe on hate speech and related subjects. As a member of this committee, he plays a crucial role in making recommendations to members states on a comprehensive approach to addressing hate speech within a human rights and anti\-discrimination framework \(E9, E10\). As a result of his work for the Committee, he has been contracted as a regional expert for Albania by the Anti\-Discrimination Directorate at the Council of Europe. 

 Faloppa’s research is transforming our understanding of the use of hate speech at a transnational level, through his appointment as an expert to various international organisations, including Amnesty Italy and the Council of Europe, and through the training he has provided to grassroots organisations and NGOs. His research has directly impacted how hate speech is perceived and brought about changes in attitudes and understanding within these organisations and beyond.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 For decades, Relationships and Sex Education \(RSE\) has been deemed to be unhelpfully negative, focused on disease or pregnancy prevention, with an over\-emphasis on basic biological information. The 2013 Ofsted Report noted that inadequacies in RSE can leave young people ‘vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation’. Fisher’s pioneering research into the history of sex has informed the development of an award\-winning approach to RSE, based on a curated, dialogic discussion of historical material/objects to inspire reflection and provoke discussion about vital topics such as consent, body image, and pornography. 

 The Sex & History method has been widely adopted across the UK and beyond as an effective means of delivering RSE in schools, museums, pupil referral units and youth clubs. Impacts include: 

-  Empowering young people, teachers, youth workers and charities with innovative RSE resources. 

-  Informing the development and delivery of curricula and new statutory requirements for comprehensive RSE provision in the UK. 

-  Generating new ways for museums to enhance health and wellbeing outcomes. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Underpinning the Sex & History method is a framework for the delivery of sex education focused on the discussion of values, stereotypes, cultural expectations and codes of femininity/masculinity. This is informed by Fisher’s prize\-winning monograph and co\-authored book on the history of sex advice, sexual learning and education, contraceptive use and personal identities in the twentieth century. Her research highlights the limitations of negative messaging, such as a focus on disease and pregnancy prevention, and an emphasis on basic biological information and the importance of cultural values in shaping and identities and behaviours. Also core to the Sex & History method is the use of open\-ended discussions. This is informed by the research methodology in Fisher’s books which demonstrated the efficacy of open\-ended unstructured interviews in stimulating discussions about sexual attitudes and practices \[ **3.1, 3.2**\] **.** 

 At the heart of the Sex & History method is a belief in the value of a dialogue between past and present to the development of sexual knowledge and identities. This is shaped by Fisher’s monographs and also by a body of research on the uses of the past in shaping sexual knowledge, undertaken by Fisher in collaboration with Rebecca Langlands \(Classics\), Jen Grove \(History, Classics and Museum Studies\), Jana Funke \(English\) and Leon Rocha \(Chinese Studies\), as part of the *Sexual Knowledge, Sexual History* project from 2008 to 2015 and then since 2015 within the Sexual Knowledge Unit at the University of Exeter \[ **3.3**, **3.4**, **3.5**, **3.6**\]. This research has shown that claims about the past have been crucial in articulating sexual morals, in driving political, legal and social change, in informing sexual science, in shaping individual identities, and in constructing and grounding knowledge about sex. A key and original finding of this interdisciplinary research is that material from past cultures has functioned perennially as a productive and challenging stimulus through which people explore sexual questions. 

 For example, Langlands and Fisher demonstrated the impact of sexually\-themed material found at the archaeological sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum on understandings of sex. They revealed that visual material such as pictures and artefacts are particularly effective media, providing an immediate and arresting point of engagement with the past \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\]. Research into collecting practices, including Grove’s PhD, supervised by Fisher and Langlands, revealed the importance of objects on the development of Western and scientific understandings of sex and sexuality \[ **3.5**, **3.6**\]. The research has also examined the history of museums, and explored the significance of displays that foregrounded gender, sex and sexuality in public debate and in engaging with varied audiences \[ **3.3**, **3.5**\]. This research informs the Sex & History method by offering thought\-provoking evidence about human practices and encouraging people to reflect on similarities and differences between cultures. The research reveals that in the context of sex education, historical material is valuable in enabling multiple interpretations, and allowing people to test ideas against their own preconceptions. It empowers people with an awareness that sex has been talked about, thought about and depicted for millennia, and provides historical distance that depersonalises discussion and reduces embarrassment.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 *Sex & History began in 2008 and involved the trial of a pilot teaching resource in Cornwall, the base of a 2014 REF impact case\-study. The impact outlined below is the result of entirely new teaching materials based on new objects and new collaborations, informed by additional research.* 

 **Empowering young people, teachers, youth workers and charities with innovative RSE resources** 

 Fisher and her collaborators have created a new suite of resources for teaching RSE in the UK and around the world. In 2015, Fisher, Langlands and Grove, in collaboration with two professional sex educators, devised an educational method based on historical objects, which they embedded in a series of RSE resources for Key Stages 4 and 5. Now with an additional set of dedicated LGBT resources, produced in 2017 in collaboration with national educational charity *Schools Out*, these have been available in the UK and globally online \[ **5.1**\]. 

  

 Teachers as far and wide as Chicago report that the resources ‘worked incredibly well’ **\[5.2\]**. Leading sex educationalists highlight their value in promoting cross\-curricular approaches and giving teachers confidence by incorporating the way they are used to teaching into the delivery of sex education **\[5.3\]**. They emphasise the benefits of ‘distancing the discussion’ around topics like pornography, making them easier to approach. This encourages students, who might otherwise be too embarrassed, to talk, leading to a ‘much better and safer discussion than an open debate’ **\[5.3\]**. They add that the resources are unusual in providing ‘interesting and challenging resources that extend learning’ for pupils in Key Stage 5, making RSE more ‘than just a pastoral intervention, but actually an intellectual and interesting part of the curriculum’ \[ **5.3**\]. This is supported by teachers’ and pupils’ experience of using them: ‘It is fascinating to see historical objects used to discuss modern\-day issues with clear links for students to follow. This will allow students to develop critical thinking and analysis skills’ \(supporting teacher\); ‘I overheard a boy telling his mum about it at the end of the day. He was really fired up about it. Sounds like an awesome session’ \(teacher, Bath\); ‘Really, really great. Inspired a good discussion’ \(pupil\) \[ **5.2**\]. 

 Sex & History has also proved effective in specialist educational settings. In 2016 a pupil referral unit in Exeter used the method in a week\-long drama project with three pupils who had experienced forms of sexual exploitation. Reported outcomes included increase in confidence and ‘bonding \[…with\] potential to create a newly supportive environment for the future’ and ‘promoting relationships between staff and students…so vital in these units’. **\[5.2\]** In Cornwall, sexual health charity Brook used the method with a group of young fathers, reporting increased confidence in discussing sexual issues \[ **5.2**\]. 

 Since 2015, these resources have been freely accessible worldwide via the *Times Education Supplement* website, from which they have been downloaded 1,318 times \(as of December 2020\) with a 4.8/5 star rating. These materials have also been supplemented with an additional set of dedicated LGBT resources produced in 2017 in collaboration with national educational charity *Schools Out*. The LGBT resources hosted by University of Exeter have been downloaded 2,468 times \(as of December 2020\) \[ **5.1**\]. The resource has been downloaded worldwide \(e.g., in September\-December 2020 alone, in Ireland, France, Iceland, Hong Kong and New Zealand\). In France, the resources are being used in the creation of an association for the promotion of inclusive sex education **\[5.2\]** 

 Fisher and the team have worked directly with more than 50 schools \(2014\-20\) to deliver both training to teachers and RSE lessons to pupils \[ **5.2**\]. However, the Sex & History method has been more widely disseminated across the country through its enthusiastic take\-up by highly regarded external agencies. The Sex Education Forum \(SEF\) is the foremost umbrella network for RSE in the UK, dedicated to quality and equitable RSE, delivering lessons directly in schools across the country and in\-depth training to teachers. For example, one member of staff estimated she had delivered lessons to over 400 children and trained over 200 teachers in the past two years **\[5.3\]**. In addition, since 2015 SEF have integrated Sex & History resources into various training programmes, including: the government\-funded anti\-homophobic, \-biphobic and \-transphobic bullying programme delivered to over 800 schools through face to face training \(2015\-9\); the core training package in all 38 secondary schools in East Sussex over a two\-year period; and SEF’s national training portfolio, including approximately 20 one\-day training sessions \(each attended by c.30 people\) per year, reaching roughly 600 teachers annually and 1000s over the past 5 years **\[5.3\]**. 

 Another key organisation, the School of Sexuality Education \(formerly, Sexplain\), developed its programme in consultation with Sex & History, using the resources as part of its portfolio to deliver intersectional, feminist and sex\-positive workshops since its inception in 2016. It is now a leading sex\-education provider in the UK, working with 33,000\+ young people in 200\+ schools and delivering training for 250\+ teachers. Sex & History also features in a PGCE short course at UCL’s Institute of Education **\[5.3\]**. The organisation’s Co\-Founder and CEO notes that ‘Sex & History materials are cleverly crafted to allow young people to objectively discuss relevant social issues such as bodily autonomy, gender and sexual pleasure in a way that is removed from their personal lives and experiences…We have found Sex & History particularly useful in addressing anxieties around discussing porn… \[it has\] influenced our own practice in delivering sex education’ \[ **5.3**\]. These organisations also highlight the uniqueness of Sex & History in its allowing teachers to integrate it into the broader curriculum, and helping them deliver LGBTQ\-inclusive RSE, ‘a challenge for many teachers, particularly those who have not received training or who do not have support of senior leadership. The Sex and History resource filled a gap in that it looked more broadly at the social and historical context.’ 

 In 2020, Fisher and the team delivered teacher training via webinars, reaching an international audience: 20 members of the National Youth Agency \(UK\) \(with the video of the webinar having been viewed 453 times since September 2020\), 90\+ teachers through National Education Union, 40 teachers in Hong Kong via the English Schools Foundation and 31 members of the UK Army Welfare Services \(working in Cyprus, Kenya and Belize\). **\[5.2\]** 

  

 **Informing the development and delivery of curricula and new statutory requirements for comprehensive RSE provision** 

 The impact of the Sex & History method on the delivery of RSE across the UK is widely acclaimed. In December 2017, it was commended by national charity the Family Planning Association for innovation and good practice in RSE \[ **5.4**\]. In 2018, it was highlighted by Public Health England as a creative approach to health education that addressed inequalities \[ **5.5**\]. It is one of the featured resources on the PSHE Association website, and Sex & History lesson plans are highlighted in the Department for Education\-recommended handbook *Great Relationships and Sex Education* \(Hoyle and McGeeney 2019\) \[ **5.6**\]. 

  

 As part of the development of a new statutory RSE policy in Wales, the team were invited to provide evidence to a Welsh Assembly Expert Panel in June 2017. The policy document informing the development of the new Welsh curriculum, including detailed guidance for schools, cites Sex & History as a case study of innovative and inclusive RSE \[ **5.7**\]. The team also attended a UK parliament event in November 2017 that informed the new UK guidelines on statutory RSE issued in 2019. Fisher and Langlands are regularly invited to contribute to policy and curriculum\-building events for teachers, third\-sector practitioners and government officials. These include: the Healthy Sexual Development event for practitioners and teachers \(Westminster, June 2017\); Delivering Outstanding Sex and Relationships Education by Inside Government \(provider of continuing professional development for effective policy implementation to the public and third sector, December 2018\); Countdown to Statutory RSE with Sir Antony Seldon \(Kingston, March 2019\); and PSHCE 200 Secondary Subject Leader Network \(Hackney, July 2019\) \[ **5.8**\]. 

  

 **Generating new ways for museums to enhance health and wellbeing outcomes** 

 In 2014, the Sex & History team curated the Intimate Worlds exhibition at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum \(RAMM\) in Exeter \(April 5\-June 29\). With over 63,000 visitors, it was an important and innovative exhibition for RAMM \[ **5.9**\] whose collections and content lead testifies that ‘Intimate Worlds provided an opportunity for RAMM to demonstrate to audiences and stakeholders the value and appeal of this type of subject matter, and its relevance… \[it\] helped to establish the status of the museum as a place for debate within Exeter *.’* \[ **5.10**\] 

  

 The exhibition and its potential to inform sex education attracted national and international media attention. It was the most\-read story in BBC Education news for a week in April 2014 and showcased with vox\-pop reactions on BBC Devon’s flagship breakfast show. Its success shaped subsequent activities and policies at RAMM, including the sector\-leading LGBT Rainbow Trail and the Queering the Museum project \[ **5.9**\]. Following the exhibition, Fisher and the team were contacted by people across the museum sector, nationally and internationally, for advice on the display of sexually themed material, modes of youth engagement and the relationship between museums and RSE. Curators at the Wellcome Collection sought their assistance in the development of the Institute of Sexology exhibition \(London, 2014\-15, 200,000 visitors\) **\[5.10\]**. They also collaborated on the ‘Sex in Six Objects’ project in Cambridge in 2016 and in 2015 they were approached by the Women’s Museum of Denmark in Aarhus to consult on an education programme regarding sexual health \[ **5.10**\]. 

  

 Since 2018 the Sex & History method’s applicability to museums has featured on the Museum Studies MA programme at University of Leicester **\[5.10\]**. Stuart Frost, of the British Museum, evaluated the Intimate Worlds exhibition in a study discussing the potential for attitudes to sex and sexuality to be explored in UK museums **\[5.10\]** The British Museum subsequently developed its own Let’s Talk about Sex programme, and has since collaborated with Fisher and the team in advising a group of museums in Berlin \(2015 to present\). This has resulted in: a permanent activity for visiting schools at the Bode Museum; a major exhibition, ‘The Eroticism of Things: Collections on the History of Sexuality’, displayed first at the Werkbundarchiv in Berlin in 2018 and subsequently at the Erotic Art Museum \(WEAM\) in Miami Beach, Florida in 2019; and the introduction of object\-based learning about sexuality at the WEAM, including indexing, researching, curating and exhibiting many objects from the Naomi Wilzig collection that have never previously been displayed \[ **5.10**\]. The 2018 *Museums as Spaces of Wellbeing* report, produced by the UK’s Culture, Health and Wellbeing Alliance, features Sex & History as an example of best practice \- further evidence of its wide\-ranging impact on the museum sector \[ **5.5**\].

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 As a result of Queen Mary research, UK patients with the debilitating Behçet’s Syndrome are now able to access a novel, integrated programme of diagnostics and disease management that has notably improved both clinical outcomes and patients’ quality of life. By pioneering a multi\-disciplinary, patient\-focused model of care for this autoinflammatory condition, Queen Mary’s Prof. Fortune has created an approved drug pathway for Behçet’s and identified effective treatment for two of the syndrome’s symptoms: oral ulceration and blood clotting. Fortune’s work led to the formation of the Behçet’s Syndrome Centres for Excellence \(BCE\), a ‘one stop clinic’ for treatment which has transformed patient care and achieved hugely positive clinical outcomes — such as cutting diagnosis time for the disease from 14 years to 1 and reducing the prevalence of serious complications such as disability and visual impairment \(the latter of which saw a 94% reduction from 2014\-2019\). These changes have drastically improved patients’ health, prognoses, and quality of life, and facilitated both direct and indirect cost savings to patients and the NHS of GBP15,878,551 \(2011\-2020\). 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Behçet’s Syndrome is a chronic, systemic condition that causes inflammation of blood vessels and tissues. It affects an estimated 0.64 per 100,000 individuals in the UK \[3.1\], with patients frequently suffering from severe oral ulceration that may progress to affect any organ in the body with debilitating consequences: skin lesions, swollen eye tissue \(uveitis\) and subsequent blindness, severe joint pain, strokes and blood clotting. 

##  Towards a better understanding of the condition 

 Research by Queen Mary has helped reveal the mechanisms behind Behçet’s Syndrome. Prof. Fortune and her team are part of the international group that completed the first Behçet’s genome\-wide association study in 2010 \[3.2\] — an approach that scans genomic markers across many individuals to identify genetic variants associated with the condition. The data confirmed the major role of the antigen HLA\-B51 in susceptibility to Behçet's Syndrome; another region upstream which subsequently led to the discovery of epistatic interactions between this antigen \(HLA\-B51\) and the enzyme ERAP1, which is associated with immune responses and genes that trigger inflammation. 

##  An effective ‘one stop clinic’ for patients 

 The Queen Mary team’s research, led by Fortune, has also found that many Behçet’s patients suffer from complex symptoms, poor patient experience, substandard care, and a generally reduced quality of life. Patients typically undergo multiple appointments in different facilities, where isolated symptoms may be treated with inaccurate diagnoses and result in poor clinical outcomes. Fortune’s work \[3.1\] led to the establishment of the Behçet’s Syndrome Centres of Excellence \(BCE\) in London, Birmingham and Liverpool, and the multidisciplinary clinics \(MDCs\) within these three, in 2012. The BCE have improved patient care while also achieving predicted annual cost savings of approximately GBP18,800 per patient \[5.8\], and now act as a ‘one stop clinic’ for 900 fully consented patients from both the UK and overseas \[3.1\]. The Centres play a leading role in Behçet’s research, and have provided Fortune’s team with recorded clinical outcomes, patient samples, and evidence of how Behçet’s impacts patients’ psychosocial wellbeing, employment situation, and levels of fatigue \[3.3, 3.4\]. Standardised oral and genital clinical severity scores have also been developed and are now used internationally \[3.5\]. 

##  Championing patient\-centred research 

 By developing a model to address the multiple and varying needs of the patient and embedding this holistic approach into all education and training initiatives, Queen Mary has advanced patient\-centred research for Behçet’s and created a multi\-disciplinary, integrated care approach to disease diagnostics. Patients are reviewed by experts from multiple clinical specialities — oral medicine, immunology, rheumatology, gastroenterology, ophthalmology and neurology, alongside a clinical psychologist and non\-medical support worker — and all clinical outcomes are reviewed regularly by BCE MDCs. Fortune and the BCE have also produced an agreed ‘Drug Pathway’ of systemic therapy and biologics that is centrally funded and delivered locally to patients. 

##  Improved drug treatments for thrombosis 

 Behçet’s patients suffer from recurrent clotting throughout the body — even when treated with anticoagulants. Fortune’s team identified why clotting occurs in this condition, finding it to be due to platelet activation \[3.7\] and confirming that anticoagulant drugs would be ineffective. Treatment guidelines for blood vessel clotting were thereby changed to instead involve immunosuppressives \(to suppress inflammatory ‘flares’ and endothelial swelling\) and antithrombotics \(which, rather than inhibiting particular coagulation pathways, instead inhibit platelet activity and thrombi — as required for the mechanism Fortune observed in Behçet’s\).

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Queen Mary has worked with the Behçet’s Syndrome Centres for Excellence \(BCE\) since their inception in 2012, and has advanced treatment, diagnosis, awareness and understanding of the debilitating disease through a combination of laboratory\- and patient\-focused research. 



#  Improving patients’ quality of life: Better diagnostics, health, and clinical outcomes 

 Queen Mary has provided significant quality\-of\-life improvements for UK patients with Behçet’s Syndrome \[5.1\]. This is largely due to the establishment of the BCE, which was driven and facilitated by Queen Mary, and the subsequent and ongoing collaboration between the Centres and the university. Fortune is Clinical Lead for the London BCE; the BCE have Centres in London, Birmingham and Liverpool, and have been described by patients as “a blessing” \[5.2\]. 

##  Rapid diagnosis — from 14 years to just 1 

 Before 2012, the average time to diagnosis for Behçet’s in the UK was 14 years. As a result of Queen Mary research, the BCE has reduced this to just 4.5 years \(in 2018\) \[5.1\]. Data from 2019 again shows improvement in most cases, with the London BCE in particular, the Centre Fortune works most closely with, achieving diagnoses in just one year \[5.1\]. 

##  Improved physical health for patients 

 The number of patients presenting with *visual impairment* has reduced annually since opening the London BCE — from 79 patients in 2015 to 22 in 2016 and 12 in 2017. Data for 2019 revealed that only 5 patients had increased visual impairment after attending the London BCE. No BCE patient has lost their sight due to Behcet’s since the Centres’ establishment \[5.1\]. *Joint pain* is another significant symptom that impairs quality of life; since the creation of the BCE, clinical outcomes related to joint\-disease\-related pain have reduced by 50% \[5.1\]. The most frequent symptom of Behçet’s Syndrome is severe *oral ulceration*. Fortune’s team developed and introduced oral health training and a bespoke mouthwash, Triorasol. This has transformed patient experience \[5.3\] and had a statistically significant and positive impact on health\-related quality of life \[3.4\]. In a study comprising of 261 Behçet’s patients, Triorasol significantly reduced oral ulceration severity scores \(OUSS\), prevented or minimised the formation of intraoral scarring and showed a comprehensive positive effect on Behçet’s outcomes \[5.3\]. In 2019, the Care Quality Commission deemed the dental hospital’s service care ‘outstanding’ \[5.4\]. 

##  Improved psychosocial health for patients 

 As a result of Queen Mary’s establishment and collaboration with the BCE, patients now experience reduced anxiety and depression. The BCE records Behçet’s impact on the psychosocial health of patients \(and vice versa, by assessing how increasing anxiety is associated with inflammation\). Every time they attend the clinic, each patient is scored using Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Patient Health, and Mental Wellbeing questionnaires to assess their depression, anxiety and mental wellbeing, and evaluate the need for any emergency intervention and support. On starting this psychology service, a patient with 5 self\-directed emergency appointments experienced decreased disease activity within 6 months, demonstrating the value of psychological support with systemic medication that improves anxiety, depression and clinical outcomes in treating Behçet’s Syndrome \[3.3\]. 

 To alleviate feelings of isolation, the BCE works closely with the society ‘Behçet’s UK’ to improve access to patient support groups. Society membership increased from 423 in 2012 to 1,114 in 2019. There are also 7 new support groups across England that provide improved signposting for additional help for patients, including introductions to counsellors within the patient’s primary care trust and assistance with the benefits system. In the BCE, the inclusion of psychological care has considerably impacted the Behçet’s patient cohort seen in London, with 441 of 845 ‘Very Highly Vulnerable’ patients actively accessing care at any given time. 

#  Improving clinical care with a ‘ *patient knows best*’ approach 

 To maintain a high level of patient care and support, the London BCE works closely with patients and clinicians in hospitals and the community. As one patient says, “the service is holistic, and \[the\] continuity of staff and doctors who know each other individually on a personal basis…facilitates much better patient care” \[5.2\]. The adoption of a ‘patient knows best’ strategy has been successful, with patient satisfaction scores of over 99% \[5.1\]. Patients are given many opportunities to provide feedback \(via clinic attendance, questionnaires and annual education days\), with this feedback driving continuous service improvement and informing best practice. Additionally, Queen Mary facilitates greater awareness and education on Behçet’s by hosting an annual national ‘Behçet’s in a day’ workshop, which provides training and updates on new research and treatment in the disease for 40–80 attendees. 

#  Informing and optimising clinical guidelines and practice 

 Queen Mary research demonstrated that gender, age and disease severity affect the activation of platelets and white blood cells in Behçet’s Syndrome \[3.7\]. This directly drove the European League Against Rheumatism \(EULAR\) to update its guidelines in 2018, and therefore impacted subsequent clinical practice. Fortune was a member of the international review committee. Patients formerly treated with the anticoagulant warfarin are now treated with antithrombotic, immunosuppressive, anti\-inflammatory \(aspirin\) and anti\-platelet drugs \[5.5\]. The use of antithrombotics and immunosuppressives were presented at the International Conference on Behçet’s Disease in 2016 \[5.6\]. 

#  Reducing costs for patients and the NHS by over GBP15,800,000 

 In 2011, ‘Behçet’s UK’ employed an independent health economist to review the then\-current service model for delivery of care to Behçet's patients. In 2019, the same firm was commissioned to ascertain whether Queen Mary’s MDC model was cost\-effective. The review confirmed that the London BCE has brought significant cost savings — direct and indirect — since 2011 \[5.7\]. 



#  Achieving international recognition of a new model of care 

 The BCE model was validated by the EU Commission’s rigorous audit process at the London Centre in September 2018, receiving an excellence rating of 97.2% for clinical service, research and education \[5.8\]. Through her research and key role in establishing and leading the BCE, Fortune and her team have demonstrated that a ‘one drug regime fits all’ strategy for clinical management is inappropriate for Behçet’s, and is neither beneficial to patients nor a cost\-effective use of treatment resources. Instead, the MDCs have enabled effective application of appropriate, patient\-tailored treatment, with timely escalation of therapy according to individual clinical need, thus, improving current care while reducing the risk of patients developing complications.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Infer is an open\-source static analysis tool for finding memory\-safety bugs in Java, C\+\+ and Objective\-C code bases. It is based on fundamental advances in automated program reasoning made by Cristiano Calcagno \(Imperial College London\), Dino Distefano \(Queen Mary, University of London\), and collaborators between 2005 and 2011. In 2009, Calcagno and Distefano founded start\-up company Monoidics to commercialise Infer. Infer and its development team were acquired by Facebook in 2013 for an undisclosed sum, with the team extending the tool to cater to large\-scale use. As described in a recent Communications of the ACM article, Infer now runs continuously on the millions of lines of code underlying the apps and back\-end servers of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. It also has many users in government and industry, such as the National Cyber Security Centre \(NCSC\), Amazon, Mozilla, Spotify, Uber, Freefem, JD.com, Marks and Spencer, Sky, OLA, Vuo, CodeAI and Tile. Infer finds reliability and security bugs, typically within minutes of their introduction so that they can be rapidly fixed. As a direct result of the basic research underpinning this case study, Infer has led to more than 100,000 bugs in the Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp code bases being found and fixed before they reached production, including many security\-critical bugs that would otherwise have potentially affected billions of users.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Nature of the research insights and findings relating to the impact:** In a series of research papers between 2006 and 2011, Cristiano Calcagno at Imperial College London and collaborators developed fundamental theory, efficient algorithms and tools for reasoning about software at an industrial scale. Almost all software used in industry manages memory using *pointers*. However, pointer\-manipulating programs suffer from difficulties posed by *aliasing*, where a program can access common regions of memory via many pathways. This makes it hard to reason about a program’s behaviour: a modification to memory made by one part of the program may end up – due to aliasing – influencing seemingly unrelated parts of the program. In 2001, *separation logic* was proposed as a new theory to aid in the reasoning about pointer\-manipulating programs. At first, it was used solely for pencil\-and\-paper reasoning; it was unclear whether it would be possible to create automated tools to analyse programs using separation logic, and whether such tools would have any hope of scaling to real world industrial systems. 

 Calcagno and collaborators demonstrated in their papers and tools that scalable reasoning *is* possible using *abstract symbolic execution*, a static analysis technique that reasons about the behaviour of a program for all potential inputs simultaneously and can thus establish a *proof* that the program is correct, or demonstrate that the program contains *bugs* related to memory safety. This line of research culminated in a Journal of the ACM paper \[R6, 2011\], showing that reasoning can be made to scale to very large code bases through a new technique called *bi\-abduction*. Bi\-abduction allows the analysis of a large code base to be broken down into many mini\-analyses, one per procedure of the program. This \(a\) decouples the scalability of analysis from the overall code base size, and \(b\) allows analysis *re\-use*: when a developer changes a small part of a large code base, only the procedures actually relevant to the change must be re\-analysed. The Journal of the ACM paper is an extended version of a POPL 2009 conference paper that introduced bi\-abduction and won the POPL Ten\-Year Test\-of\-Time award. 

 **Outline of underpinning research, and associated dates:** The research was conducted between 2005 and 2011. The first academic semi\-automated reasoning tool for pointer\-manipulating programs, using *abstract symbolic execution* based on separation logic, was Smallfoot \[R1, 2005\]. This led to extensions to the theory to support pointer arithmetic, common in C\-family languages \[R2, 2006\]. The problems with Smallfoot were that users had to annotate all functions with preconditions, and that it only worked with simple data structures, e.g., linked lists. This was partly mitigated by *precondition discovery* \[R3, 2007\] and work on composite data\-structure reasoning \[R4, 2007\]. Now the method could be used to analyse thousands of lines of code for the first time, including Microsoft device drivers \[R5, 2008\]. The industrial breakthrough came in 2009 with the introduction of *bi\-abduction* for highly automated inference of function preconditions \[R6, 2011\] \(an extension of the POPL 2009 paper that introduced bi\-abduction\). The combination of abstract symbolic execution and bi\-abduction unlocked scalability to millions of lines of code and has enabled Infer’s widespread industrial impact. 

 Bi\-abduction is at the heart of the Infer tool that forms the basis of this case study: the large\-scale roll\-out of Infer at Facebook has involved engineering work to optimise the tool, but the core analysis engine remains a faithful realisation of the basic fundamental research introduced in \[R1–R6\], while Calcagno was working full time at Imperial.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact arising from this research during the REF period of 1 August 2013 and 31 December 2020 is related to Facebook acquiring *Infer*, a start\-up company and software tool based on the fundamental research described above, and the wide industrial adoption of the Infer tool. Facebook has integrated the Infer tool with their continuous development workflow, discovering and fixing a large number of bugs in products used by billions of users. After making the technology available as open source, there has been broad adoption by companies across the whole software industry. 

 **Background to the Facebook acquisition.** Based on the success of the foundational research described above for enabling scalable reasoning about pointer\-manipulating programs, Calcagno and Distefano \(based at Imperial College London and Queen Mary University of London, respectively\) incorporated a start\-up company, Monoidics Ltd. \(company no.  [06805518](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/06805518)\), in January 2009, as directors. They developed the *Infer* tool, an implementation of the line of research \(papers R1 – R6 above\) that culminated in the Journal of the ACM article \[R6\]. Monoidics was funded by Quantum Wave Capital, received support from the  [CARP EU FP7 project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/100709/factsheet/en) \(led by Imperial College London\), and reported ARM, Airbus and Mitsubishi Electric as customers. In July 2013,  [Facebook acquired the assets of Monoidics for an undisclosed sum and hired the engineering team](https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/18/facebook-monoidics/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_cs=D7Vu-50cWcsOjYru6SpPHQ), including Calcagno \[I1\]. Calcagno has since worked as a Software Engineer at Facebook, remaining a Lecturer on Leave of Absence at Imperial until 2017, and now retains his connection with Imperial as an Honorary Lecturer. 

 **Impact of Infer at Facebook.** Facebook integrated Infer into its perpetual software development process \[I2\]. As a result, Infer is now used to *continuously* analyse the multi\-million\-line code bases of both mobile apps and back\-end services at Facebook, as well as the software associated with WhatsApp and Instagram \[I3\]. Each time a developer commits any code change, Infer analyses the change and participates in the code review process, indicating potential memory safety problems that the programmer may have overlooked. This is possible due to the scalability afforded by bi\-abduction \[R6\]: only the procedures related to the code change must be re\-analysed, meaning that analysis can complete within minutes, providing a report of potential problems while the code changes are fresh in the mind of the developer. 

 At a talk at Imperial College London in 2015, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer said about Infer: *“It’s a really key component of being able to build an app and ship it weekly to a billion people. If you want to do this without everything grinding to a halt, it’s really helpful to have a system that automatically detects and helps with bugs”* \[I4\]. In a 2019 Communications of the ACM article, Facebook explains that Infer now runs continuously on millions of lines of code, and that so far **more than 100,000 bugs** found by Infer have been fixed before affecting end users. It reports a **high fix rate of 70%** associated with memory safety bugs flagged by Infer \[I3\]. 

 The high degree of impact that Infer continues to have, and its underpinning by the original research of Calcagno et al., is summed up well in the letter from Facebook’s Director of Engineering \[I5\]: *“Today within Facebook, the verification technology originally designed by Prof Dino Distefano, Dr Cristiano Calcagno and colleagues contributes to the quality of the products we serve to over 2 billion people every day. Currently Infer analyses every applicable code change within Facebook and its family of apps \(Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus\). Every month, thousands of issues are fixed before these apps are shipped to users. Thus, Infer has saved Facebook engineers innumerable hours that they would have had to spend debugging the problems it detected, had those problems reached production.”* 

 The significance of the link between the fundamental research and its impact was recognised by the Infer team receiving the prestigious  [2016 CAV Award](https://research.fb.com/blog/2016/09/four-facebook-employees-win-the-prestigious-cav-award/), which *“recognizes their contribution to the development of Separation Logic, the theory that underpins the Infer static analyser”*. 

 **Impact of Infer beyond Facebook.** Infer was made open source in 2015 \[I6\], making it available to other companies. The  [open source repository](https://github.com/facebook/infer) is very active \(>150 contributors\) and popular \(starred by >12,000 GitHub users, forked >1,600 times\). Companies who have publicly acknowledged using Infer include Amazon Web Services, Mozilla, Oculus, Spotify, Uber, Freefem, JD.com, Marks and Spencer, Sky, Money Lover, LA, Netcetera, Vuo, CodeAI, and Tile \[I7\]. The National Cyber Security Centre \(NCSC, part of GCHQ\) also uses Infer. We detail here the four most significant uses of Infer in industry and government beyond Facebook: by Spotify, Uber, Muse Dev \(a recent start\-up company\), and NCSC. 

 *Spotify*: The Android Infrastructure team at Spotify have extended Infer in order to incorporate it in their continuous integration process for Android. In an article describing the collaboration \[I8\], A Spotify engineer writes: *“In our quest to make our code even better, we started using Infer. Infer found several legitimate issues that other tools had missed. The Infer team was also very helpful in following a few false positives that we encountered, and we now have it running on our build servers.”* 

 *Uber*: Uber have reported using Infer in a portfolio of tools for static detection of null pointer exceptions, claiming that this endeavour *“reduced the number of NPEs observed in our apps in production by an order of magnitude”* \[I9\]. 

 *MuseDev*: A spin\-off company from  [Galois](https://galois.com/), Muse<ins>Dev</ins> is a new company providing tools and services for automated code reasoning. As detailed further in the supporting letter from MuseDev CEO \[I10\], MuseDev runs a cloud\-based code analysis service that uses Infer as its flagship analyser: *“Via Muse, Infer is now running daily in the cloud on several open source repositories. And we are actively working with a variety of enterprises to deploy and run MuseDev in their environments, including Fortune 500 and fast\-growing venture\-backed technology companies.”* The “cool math” link on the MuseDev website is to a  [review article on separation logic](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/2/234356-separation-logic/fulltext), with a section entitled “Bi\-Abduction and Facebook Infer” that indicates the importance of the underpinning research. Magill further stresses the breakthrough nature of this research: *“The technology developed at Imperial and Queen Mary ushered in a new wave of static analysis, capable of finding subtle and important bugs while running quickly enough to fit into modern agile development workflows. In fact, in talking with customers, we often use the terms ‘first wave’ and ‘second wave’ to distinguish just how different these techniques are from what came before.”* 

 *National Cyber Security Centre \(NCSC\):* This case study is accompanied by a confidential letter from the Head of High Assurance Engineering Research at NCSC \(available to reviewers of the case study\), outlining the use of Infer by NCSC and the significance of the fundamental research on which Infer is based \[I11\]. 

 **Beneficiaries of the impact:** The companies that use Infer are direct beneficiaries of the impact: 18 large organisations publicly advertise that they use the tool \[I7\], and the open source. The improvement in software quality afforded by Infer is to the benefit of the users of the products that these companies build. Facebook alone report that Infer has led to more than 100,000 fixed bugs in the Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram code bases \[I3\]. 

 **Nature of the impact:** Software bugs are expensive:  [a report from the Consortium for IT Software Quality \(CISQ\)](https://www.it-cisq.org/the-cost-of-poor-quality-software-in-the-us-a-2018-report/The-Cost-of-Poor-Quality-Software-in-the-US-2018-Report.pdf) estimates that the cost of poor\-quality software in the US alone is USD2.84 trillion. By finding bugs early during the software development process, Infer helps reduce these costs, leading to major economic impact. Billions of people worldwide depend on products developed by the companies that use Infer. The large number of software defects in these products that have been fixed during development, after identification by Infer, and that would otherwise have reached production to the detriment of end users is evidence of the broad societal nature of the impact \[I3\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by the Glaciology group at Swansea University predicted the 2017 calving of Iceberg A\-68, one of the largest icebergs ever recorded. We proactively engaged with the media, developed a sustained social media campaign and a dedicated interactive website to highlight the impact of our research, which culminated in an unprecedented global reach \(>50,000,000 people\). Our online survey, looking at people’s interest in polar science before and after their interaction with our campaign, demonstrated a significant impact on awareness, understanding and behaviour among nearly 1,600 respondents. As a result of our research and engagement, Iceberg A\-68 became globally famous, and a more widespread understanding of the significance of massive icebergs in the Earth’s system was gained.

###  2. Underpinning research 

###   

 Supported by a series of RCUK research grants, *Stability of Larsen Ice Shelf* \[ **G1**\], *Marine ice in Larsen C ice shelf* \[ **G2**\] and *Impact of melt on ice shelf dynamics and stability* \[ **G3**\], Swansea University glaciologists \(Luckman, Kulessa, Jansen and Bevan\) have been investigating Antarctic ice shelves and their present and future stability for over a decade. Our main geographic focus has been the Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctic’s 4<sup>th</sup> biggest ice shelf and we have used field geophysics, satellite remote sensing and numerical modelling to investigate ice shelf processes in this region. Specifically, we investigated the surface structure of the Larsen C ice shelf and highlighted that rift zones \(large fractures\) within Larsen C Ice Shelf represent weaknesses that warrant careful monitoring \[ **R1**\]. Jansen et al. \[ **R2**\] established the present stability of this ice shelf and demonstrated that the mechanics of suture zones needed further study. This paper also pointed out for the first time that the Larsen C Ice Shelf rift had the potential to develop into a significant iceberg, while what remained of Larsen C after iceberg calving could develop dynamic conditions akin to those that led to disintegration of the Larsen B Ice Shelf. 

 In related work Luckman et al. \[ **R3**\], investigated the prevalence and formation of basal fractures, and Kulessa et al. \[ **R4**\], identified a mechanism for arresting fractures and postulated that Larsen C could have the same principal stress distribution that led to collapse of Larsen B in 2002. Our research on Larsen C led us to an awareness of the risk to stability from rifts in specific locations and encouraged us to closely monitor the part of the ice shelf where rift development would have the most impact \[ **R2**\]. Using satellite data and our own computer models, we were the first to detect and report on a potentially significant rift in early 2015 \[ **R5**\]. We provided the first evidence that the rift would soon develop into an iceberg of significantly large size and described the potential impact that this calving might have on the remaining ice shelf \[ **R5**\]. We also described how surface melt can influence bulk ice shelf structure and therefore resilience to fracture \[ **R6**\]. Luckman \(an expert in satellite data analysis\) continued to closely monitor the development of the rift using highly specialised techniques such as SAR interferometry and feature tracking. Because of the scarcity of conventional, visible\-light satellite imagery of the ice shelf due to the predominant cloud cover and polar night\-time, these techniques were crucial in allowing us to monitor the progression of the rift \[ **R5**\]. In 2017, the largest calving event since the 1980s occurred as predicted \[ **R5**\], giving birth to A\-68, a 5,800 km<sup>2</sup> iceberg.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We attracted media and attention to the imminent calving of a very large iceberg from Larsen C Ice Shelf by rapidly publishing a short paper \[ **R5**\], creating the MIDAS website \[ **C5**\] to provide updates of events, and using Social Media to draw attention to them \[ **C6**\]. Once we had exercised this approach to establish a relationship with Jonathan Amos of the BBC, we used direct communication with him to generate further media interest. 

 We were able to sustain media and public interest in the story \(and thus in ice shelf research\) because the rift propagation occurred in several stages, each of which we were uniquely positioned to both rapidly detect and directly communicate to the BBC. The subsequent iceberg calving was of equal media interest and we maintained our careful scientific reporting of the events as they unfolded. We were diligent in addressing media interest, giving several radio and TV interviews \[ **C4**\] and answering email queries with as much factual information as we could provide. 

 

 
 

 
 

 **Figure 1**: Media Reach 

<ins> **Reach**</ins> is evidenced by geographical coverage and audience volume. The 2017 calving event was featured on the home pages of three of the world’s largest online news outlets: the BBC \(tweeted to 6,500,000 followers, with 429 comments\) \[ **C1**\], the Guardian \(shared \~11,000 times with 1667 comments; \[ **C2**\], and the New York Times \(NYT\) \(tweeted to 38,000,000 followers\) \[ **C3**\]. Each of these articles featured interviews with Luckman and utilized graphics provided by the *MIDAS* team. Between January 2017 and February 2018, the Larsen C story received \~6,500 items of coverage in 98 countries \(Fig. 1, data obtained from Swansea Press office, \[ **C6**\]\), online, in print, on TV, and in radio articles. Through follow\-up interviews with BBC Science Correspondent Jonathon Amos, the team at Swansea University generated 9 articles of BBC Online coverage, following the progression of the rift, the calving event and the progress of iceberg A\-68 \[ **C4**\] \(most recently in February 2020\). One of these articles was the second most read piece of the news outlet on 31 May 2017 \(Swansea Press Office, \[ **C6**\]\). Luckman’s article for *The Conversation* had \~147,000 reads \[ **C6**\] and 2,097 social media shares. Luckman also gave a Royal Geographical Society \(RGS\) lecture in May 2017 \(audience \~400\). 

 

 **Figure 2**: Social Media Reach 



 *@MIDASOnIce* 

Alongside these media activities, via Twitter we shaped how the public narrative evolved by directing journalists to the *MIDAS* project website, where we posted regular blog updates \[ **C5**\]. Many journalists guided their readers to this website – “ *As a journalist based in Cape Town, our readers have great interest in this kind of news. I was able to use the links and embed it in my news article for further reading*” \(Quote 737, \[ **C9**\]\) and “ *I think the information you provide is extremely valuable. I am a member of the media and I came to your site to get information directly from the source instead of using CNN's story/content/info*” \(Quote 397, \[ **C9**\]\). Consequently, we saw page visits spike from 22 page views before we broke the story to 50,000 views two days later. Similarly, the *@MIDASOnIce* Twitter account received a 14\-fold increase in followers between 2017 and 2018 \(Fig. 2\). Tweets from *@MIDASOnIce* and *@Adrian\_Luckman* announcing the calving event earned \~2,000,000 impressions. We estimate that overall, our engagement reached as much as 50,000,000 people; see \[ **C6**\] for a breakdown of social media engagements. 

 

 **Figure 3**: Social Media Significance 

<ins> **Significance**</ins> is evidenced by the scale of the direct and follow\-on media coverage and social media shares, as well as the resulting stimulation of public debate. For example, the BBC, Guardian, and NYT home page articles generated a total of 2,339 reader comments, and the NYT article triggered an Op\-Ed that same day \[ **C7**\]. A Google Trends analysis shows that the popularity of the search terms ‘ *Larsen C*’, ‘ *Larsen C crack*’, ‘ *Antarctica*’, and ‘ *Iceberg*’ \(Fig. 3\) increased by as much as 1000% during 2017 \[ **C8**\]. 

 These factors demonstrate that we generated **awareness, inspiration and curiosity** in the general public which is further evidenced by the worldwide responses to our online survey on the *MIDAS* website. Ninety percent of the 1,596 respondents \(geographic spread seen in Fig. 4\) agreed that being made aware of the Larsen C rift made them want to learn more about the cryosphere and polar science \[ **C9**\]. 

 

 **Figure 4**: Public Reach 

Respondent comments also provide evidence that our coverage of the iceberg story impacted their lives, in the following ways: **i\)** **Increasing understanding:** “ *As someone who is not a scientist, I very much appreciate sites like this that give me a better feel of how our world is changing.”* \(Quote 285 \[ **C9**\]\) **;** **ii\)** **Stimulating curiosity**: “ *Wow, thanks. You have my whole family talking about ice\!”* \(Quote 269 \[ **C9**\]\); **iii\) Generating concern and behavioural change:** “ *Added to my growing concerns about climate change and motivated me more to think and act on what can be done at a personal and community level to mitigate it.”* \(Quote 101 \[ **C9**\]\); **iv\)** **Stimulating a desire to learn more:** “ *This article has piqued my curiosity to learn more about climate change, and particularly the changes within Antarctica and its c change, and particularly the changes within Antarctica and its composition”* \(Quote 692, \[ **C9**\]\) **;  and **v\) Improving the capacity to inform others:** *“Your information and related Twitter feeds have been a great source of material. I give presentations to my local U3A several times a year on Climate Change.”* \(Quote 25, \[ **C9**\]\) and “ *I use your blog to help me design climate change lessons for my college classes.”* \(Quote 285 \[ **C9**\]\). This last category was wide\-ranging, including school teachers, college lecturers, the University of the Third Age \(U3A\), and journalists, all reporting to have used our MIDAS website and twitter feeds material \(such as time lapse videos of the rift and iceberg\) to aid in the engagement of their various audiences. 

 Our research and coverage of the rifting process also **influenced strategic and logistics decisions** made by the British Antarctic Survey \(BAS\), who responded to our alert of the propagating rift in late 2016 by cancelling planned fieldwork on the Larsen C Ice Shelf \[ **C10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A collective body of research by the History unit on seminal figures and events in Scottish history generated a range of impacts on cultural institutions and public understanding. The research charted the afterlives of William Wallace, Robert Burns, and the Union of 1707. It has benefited curatorial interpretation in national museums, and it has been widely used by heritage groups and media to inform diverse local, national and international audiences. The impacts were achieved through partnerships with cultural organisations, public engagement, and the high media profile of the research. The impacts are significant in bringing contested academic histories of Scotland to bear on wider understanding.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research by Morton and Whatley addressed Wallace, Burns, and the Union in the context of Scotland’s modern historical identity. Their work on Wallace and Burns demonstrated that iterative portrayals of these two iconic figures of Scotland’s ‘national tale’ had added layers of interpretation upon pre\-existing unionist and nationalist narratives. Whatley’s research used fresh evidence to explain how the Union had framed political nationalism over three hundred years. All of this research, presented mainly in three major monographs, challenged conventional wisdom about the ‘national tale’. 

 A key conclusion from the underpinning research was that the Union agreement was not reached through bribery. In *The Scots and the Union* \(2006, 2007\), Whatley revised the view that financial self\-interest and bribery lay behind the Articles of Union being settled. Rooted in a collective biography of Scots politicians and others of influence, Whatley established that many of those political actors had held long\-standing and principled support for political union, some since the Revolution of 1688/9. By undermining the popular refrain from Burns that the Scots had been ‘bought and sold for English gold’ the research dismissed the grounds upon which contemporary commentators have maintained the Union was misbegotten and therefore illegitimate. This challenge to conventional wisdom was recognised by the award of the Saltire Society’s History Book of the Year in 2007 and led one reviewer to conclude it ‘sets the agenda for discussions of the Union then, and the Union now’ \( *Scottish Historical Review*, 87 \(2008\): 345\). In 2014, the research was extended to examine how the Union settlement informs contemporary national identity \[R1\]. It was demonstrated that the modern nationalist movement in Scotland has made infrequent use of the nation’s history—in comparison with examples from Europe—because key carriers of national identity remained compatible with Union. Whatley further established that Jacobitism could not adequately replace the trope of bribery in nationalist history. Instead, the research concluded that for a ‘usable nationalist history’ to inform the Referendum vote in 2014, it should be one framed by the Union, not formed solely in opposition to the Union. 

 The conclusions reached in **R1** added to research that reassessed two central but equivocal historical figures: the national patriot William Wallace \(d.1305\) and national bard Robert Burns \(1759\-96\). Both figures have encapsulated national identity through the commemoration and memorialisation of their lives: more monuments were built to honour Wallace in nineteenth\-century Scotland than any other figure, and more monuments were built to honour Burns around the world than for any other poet. A survey run in 1999 by *Who’s Who* voted Burns and Wallace the two ‘greatest Scots’ in history \( *Scotsman*, 18/12/99\). The research was conceptualised through the ‘national tale’, a term taken out of its literary moorings to examine how personal biography has been reforged as the nation’s biography over long periods of time **\[R4\]**. Morton found that modern Scots traced the origins of their civil and national liberties to Wallace, Bruce and the medieval wars of independence. He analysed every statue and monument built to honour Wallace as points where social memory is privileged and shared within the community. He correlated these sites with a survey of natural formations located across lowland Scotland named after Wallace. By then charting the changing literary and visual media that transmitted the national tale, he discovered how Jane Porter’s best\-selling *Scottish Chiefs* \(1810\) placed Wallace as Scotland’s contribution to contemporary British national identity. This analysis reconceptualised the national tale within British constitutionalism rather than Jacobite romance **\[R5\]**. Morton challenged conventional wisdom that Wallace was solely a separatist hero. His evidence proved that Wallace underpinned both unionist and nationalist histories in contemporary Scotland, including throughout the political response to *Braveheart* \(1995\) and *Brave* \(2012\). The research explained how the transfiguration of historical heroes into national symbols allowed for national identity in Scotland to encompass complex and at times contradictory interpretations of the Union to coexist **\[R6\]**. 

 Linking this research into profoundly equivocal heroes was an investigation into a previously unstudied aspect of memory fixing \( *lieu de memoire*\), which revealed major shifts over time in how and why Burns was remembered and commemorated **\[R2\]**. Whatley demonstrated that Burns’ legacy in Scottish society in the long period after his death was widespread and deeply entrenched. The research was supported by an AHRC project ‘Robert Burns: Inventing Tradition and Securing Memory’ \(PI. Murray Pittock, Glasgow\) from which Whatley created a database of all the known memorials produced on Burns. The major conclusion was that the commemoration of Burns was much wider and more pervasive that had been hitherto understood. Beyond the theatre of the Burns supper, the wider social memory of Burns was sustained by his national tale being invoked at all kinds of community\-based gatherings in Scotland and across the Scottish diaspora **\[R2, R3\]**. The proletarian allegory that was built on the afterlife of Burns served to support a particular Scottish ethos, one claiming roots in a collective spirit and a greater \(than in England\) sense of community. Yet evidence was also uncovered, in poetry and song, where Burns was reinterpreted as an inspiration to British unity in the first half of the twentieth century and to universal values in the contemporary period.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###  Cultural institutions and curatorial interpretation 

 The underpinning research has influenced curatorial interpretation in three Scottish museums. At the National Museum of Scotland, Morton’s research **\[R4**, **R5**, **R6\]** formed the basis of a display at the exhibition ‘Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland’ \(June\-November 2019\). The lead curator of the exhibition confirms that Morton’s research on the cults of Wallace and Bruce was placed alongside the history of Walter Scott to explain ‘romantic nationalism’ **\[E1\]**. One reviewer on Tripadvisor said: ‘I visited this exhibition with a friend and cannot rate it highly enough. Very user friendly with many fascinating facts about the romantic image of the Highlands post Culloden which persists to this day’ \(September 2019\). 

 Whatley’s research was used by the National Trust for Scotland’s Robert Burns Birthplace Museum to support its interpretation of the bard’s social significance. The conclusions from **R2** and **R3** were added to the ‘Burnsometer’ display, which charts the growing fame and influence of Burns over time. The inaugural curator confirms that the research was also used when the Trust reinterpreted the Burns Monument \(1823\) \- adjacent to the museum within the Memorial Gardens \- after major refurbishment in 2018\-19. Attracting over two million visitors since it opened in 2011, many from overseas, the £21m Birthplace Museum can better interpret Burns’ influence on Scottish national identity because of Whatley’s research **\[E2\]**. The research was also used by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery to interpret its collections, particularly the ‘invaluable’ national and international database of Burns sculptural monuments **\[R3\]**. The gallery’s Senior Curator of British Art described **R2** as ‘revelatory on a national and international scale’ **\[E3\]**. 

 **Public understanding** 

 The research on Wallace has influenced public understanding nationally and internationally. Morton was invited by the St Andrew’s Society of Toronto to curate a public symposium and Celtic concert to memorialise the 700<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the battle of Bannockburn, contrasting the afterlives of Wallace and Bruce through to the modern day \(21/6/14, c.150 people\) **\[R5\]**. Meeting the Society’s remit to ‘celebrate Scottish heritage and support our community’, the audience included members of the Society, the general public of Ontario, and affiliated clan and Burns societies. In the Society’s *Newslette*r, this collaboration was described as having been ‘a wonderful opportunity to learn about the “Scottish Narrative” across the centuries’ \(No. 3, Sept 2014, p. 5\). A member writing on behalf of the Society contacted Morton \(25/6/14\): ‘I was deeply impressed with both the amount of research undertaken and the depth of knowledge you provided, and I remain grateful for all that you did to make this important commemoration so intellectually rewarding’. Feedback sent to the Society confirmed that the event had raised awareness: ‘I wanted to congratulate you all on the day. I overheard one young man on the phone … telling his wife that it was a really good day and that he was learning lots about Bannockburn.’ Another wrote: ‘I've been thinking about returning to university and taking more courses—this is the impetus I needed\!’ **\[E4\]**. 

 Reflecting on the symposium and a public talk given in collaboration with the Toronto\-based Scottish Studies Foundation \(SSF\) in 2016, members of the Scottish diaspora were informed that ‘… Graeme \[Morton\]'s work on Wallace has not only been informative in its own right, but has moved many Scots\-Canadians to look to their own identity and to explore their Scots heritage’ **\[E5\]**. Morton was also invited to address the Scottish\-Canadian community in Vancouver on Wallace by delivering the Annual Tartan Day Lecture on behalf of Simon Fraser University and its affiliated diaspora groups \(9/4/16\); and to inform c.100 of the Scottish\-American community in New York on behalf of the Scottish government \- on emigration after the Union \- during Tartan Week \(2/4/19\) **\[E6\]**. After presenting new research to the membership of the SSF in September 2019 **\[R6\]**, the Foundation’s President commented: ‘once again your research not only reinforced our members' understanding of Wallace but how, in new ways, we might view how Scotland's national identity has evolved since the Union of 1707’ **\[E7\]**. 

 Public interest in **R4** led to invitations for Morton to speak at a number of high\-profile events in Scotland. They included the Edinburgh International Book Festival \(24/8/15\) where Morton addressed an audience of c.300 people. One commentator stated: ‘Of all the lectures I attended at the Edinburgh Book Festival, Morton's crowd contained the highest percentage of Scots, all of whom were eager to see the facts of their great national hero parsed out from the legends that have overtaken him’ **\[E8\].** Other talks included the Wigtown Book festival \(2/10/15\) and ‘Previously … Scotland’s History Festival’ \(22/11/15\), where Morton gave the closing lecture. 

 Whatley’s research on the Union of 1707 and its legacies **\[R1\]** led to the creation of the Five Million Questions public forum \(5MQ\) in Dundee. Established in the run\-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum and led by Whatley, 5MQ enabled the issues surrounding independence to be examined in a public space where the complexity of nationalist and unionist versions of history was recognised, and where political events were discussed in their historical context **\[E6\]**. Whatley’s analysis of the Union’s origins and how it had structured national identity since 1707 attracted over 300 people to that 5MQ event \(29/5/14\). A Scottish Labour MSP with a twitter following of 8500 was inspired to lead a twitter discussion on how sixteenth\-century conceptions of political union shaped the Union agreement in 1707. Over 360 people attended the concluding event of 5MQ, a debate led by Whatley on the ‘Referendum of 2014 in Historical perspective’ \(27/9/14\). Over 7,000 people attended 5MQ events in total, and its YouTube channel passed 16,000 hits **\[E9\]**. It established a high public profile across the UK by including Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon and Alastair Darling amongst its speakers. 

 The unit’s Scottish history research is also actively disseminated to wider audiences through a collaboration between its Centre for Scottish Culture \(CSC\) and the preeminent public history magazine in Scotland, *History Scotland*. A series of public lectures hosted jointly by the Centre and the magazine were filmed, transcribed, and published. This partnership was launched with Whatley’s debate on Jacobitism and the Union \(based on **R1**\), which achieved 24,688 views on YouTube. One attendee at the debate commented that ‘it widened my view and made me consider other interpretations’. Our partners confirm the value of using our research in this way: ‘these links allow us to further our aims of bringing world class research to an engaged and enthusiastic audience’ **\[E10\]**. 

 **Informing audiences via the media** 

 The unit’s research on Scottish history also had a high media profile, a key way in which it informed public understanding. Contributions to media coverage and discussions of the historical context of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum were extensive. Whatley’s expertise on the Union of 1707 and its legacies was in high demand from local and national journalists. Whatley was sought out for comment by Associated Press, STV, *Scotsman*, BBC Scotland, BBC Radio 2 \(Jeremy Vine\), BBC Radio 4, Sky News, *Le Figaro*, *Frankfurter Allgemeine*, *La Segunda*, *British Politics Review* \(Norway\), and the American news and comment website *The Daily Beast* \(1m readers per day\). One newspaper which used his research to advance political debate, described Whatley as a ‘top historian voicing his view on independence’ \( *Daily Record* 12/11/13; circulation c.106,000\). *Publico* translated Whatley’s conclusion that the Union of 1707 made sense to eighteenth\-century contemporaries and that it had long created a positive environment for Scots \(14/9/14\). The Europe correspondent for ABC Radio in Australia, Barbara Miller, interviewed Whatley to help her listeners understand why the analogous economic challenges of 1707 were apparently being ignored in the 2014 debate \(‘Scots divided on eve of historic poll’, 17/9/14\). A survey of academics who attained impact during the Referendum debate concluded: ‘top of the list of honour is Professor Chris Whatley’ \(Kerevan & Cochrane, *Scottish Independence,* 2014: 134\-5\). Because of its influence in shaping public debate, 5MQ and Whatley’s research were featured in Channel 4’s ‘Dispatches’ \(7/7/14\) and in *The Times*, following a lecture given in the Scottish Parliament \(29/9/14\). The objectivity of 5MQ was endorsed by the First Minister \(Scottish Parliament, 13/11/13\). Brian Taylor, Political Editor for BBC Scotland, portrayed 5MQ as ‘thoughtful and valuable’ for the insights it gave to his reporting \(BBC News, 22/9/15\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The overall impact of the work detailed in this case study is to give voice and visibility to issues around migration and racism and the specific impact of the above projects can be summarised as follows: 

-  \- Gives a voice to migrants and refugees, giving them the opportunity to voice their desire for inclusion, their rights and quality of life while raising awareness of their circumstances and stimulating discussion about equality and human rights. Through creative practice \- films, animations and other outputs \- the work detailed in this impact case study opened new avenues for them to explore and share their experiences in an open context. 

-  \- Gives visibility to issues of institutionalised as well as more widespread racism in the cultural industries. BAME students have benefitted from these works which have changed their perception of the educational and industry environment. 

-  \- Contributes to the understanding and analysis of migration as a wider phenomenon. Starting from a general theoretical analysis moving into practice\-based production, the micro\-stories of immigrants are surfaced. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

###  The underpinning research is based on Dr Kostas Maronitis’ work on European immigration and Ricardo Barker’s practice\-based research on filmmaking and institutional racism and the gap in student retention for BAME \(Black, Asian and Minority, Ethnic\) students within British universities. Maronitis’ book *Postnationalism and the Challenges to European Integration in Greece: The Transformative Power of Immigration* \(2017\) is one of the first examinations of the immigration crisis and its impact on politics and society. This research offers a timely assessment of immigration policies and perspectives in Europe; reflects the salience of immigration in recent debates and electoral contests across Europe; and examines Greece’s experience of harmonising and integrating itself with the EU while dealing with the phenomena of immigration and asylum. Maronitis formulates the concept of “Europia” in order to analyse how the immigration crisis creates utopian and dystopian visions regarding the present and future of the European project. The book is comprised of distinctive yet interconnected case studies around the themes of political theory and the EU; immigration policy and control of mobility; detention and human rights; and integration and tolerance \(R1, R2, R3\). 

###  The socio\-political themes of integration and tolerance are explored from a creative and a pedagogical point view in a number of practice\-based projects. In this context, and as part of the ongoing discussion within MFC, film practitioner Barker developed a practice\-based research filmic project on BAME students in higher education through which he visually analyses issues of retention and discrimination. *Re:Tension* \(2019\) is a 20\-minute film that follows the character Thapelo, a bright and capable university student, on a day where he is unwittingly forced to question the judgements of his tutors and peers, and delve deeper into his own actions, choices and beliefs \(R5\). The film addresses the topic of institutional racism and the issue of retention amongst ethnic minority students within British universities. The film’s research is grounded in statistical data that highlights the unexplained dropout rate of BAME students. Furthermore, the film attempts to provide a real insight into unconscious racial harassment within the Higher Education system and the micro\-aggressions that often go unnoticed. BAME students were also involved in the whole production process of the film. 

###  Alongside producing Barkers’ film, our in\-house production company: Trinity Vision also developed audio\-visual projects in this area of research, often in collaboration with the International Research Centre for Interactive Storytelling \(IRIS\) at Leeds Trinity. These projects are \(R4\): 

###  *ADIRA/SADACCA – Mental Health and Me \(2019\-20\) \-* A collection of conversations: Sheffield based charity ADIRA and SADACCA members discuss their thoughts and experiences of mental health, cultural identity and breaking a cycle of misconceptions both within and towards BAME communities. 

###  *“Our Keighley” \(The Good Shepherd Centre\) 2017 – 2019 An exhibition of 12 videos exploring individual residents’ experiences.* Intended for use in schools, focussing on children living on a particular housing estate in Keighley some of whom have recently migrated from Poland, Slovakia and Iraq. 

###  *Leeds City Council & The Children’s Society \(2018\)* 

###  Young Refugees who have recently been moved from London to Leeds by the government talk about their lives in Leeds. 

 *Hearts & Hopes / My Bright Kite \(2016\-2018\).* Two Films: “An intercultural child voice project linking children in Leeds with children seeking refuge around the world” 

###  The above list of practice\-based productions clearly shows the involvement of Trinity Vision in ongoing research within MFC on immigration and BAME people and its contribution to the general engagement of the team in research that brings theory into practice and vice\-versa.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 All projects involved in this case study have an impact on the general perception of issues linked to immigration, racism and BAME communities which results from wide\-spread sharing across media, public organisations, film festivals and educational work 

 Dr Kostas Maronitis has been quoted in and given interviews in over 30 national and international media outlets, such as BBC Radio, LBC, The Yorkshire Post, the Daily Express, Huck Magazine, Radio Aire and the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita. In 2017 the political weekly magazine New Statesman published his article on the legacy of New Labour and Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour Party. Moreover, his article on automation and immigration has been disseminated to members of the RMT Union, the International Workers Union of Great Britain and the United Voices of the World Union through internal mailing lists and publications. In 2020 Maronitis was acknowledged as an expert contributor by the Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology \(POST\) for submitting questions to the House of Commons and House of Lords around the themes of the future of work and the pandemic; immigrant workers and no recourse to public funds; welfare, public health and workers’ rights – the questions asked were two, on the 30<sup>th</sup> of June 2020 and 8<sup>th</sup> of October 2020 **\(S6\)**. 

 Ricardo Barker’s film has been screened at two festivals, demonstrating impact nationally and internationally \(reach\) as well as with large audiences. *Re:Tension* was screened at *the Queen Palm* film festival 2020 \(Social Awareness Shorts section\) on streaming platforms and at the *Festival International du Film PanAfrican de Cannes* 2020. The latter has an audience of 300\+ people and a Facebook page with 12k followers which gave large visibility to the film. Furthermore, in a teaching and learning context, it was shortlisted for the prestigious: *Learning On\-Screen Awards: Educational Film Award* \(University/Colleges category\) **\(S4\)**. According to the Learning on Screen official website: “Entries to this category can have been produced to educate either a general audience or those with a specific interest”, recognising the education quality of the film. 

 It played an important role in achieving the REC Bronze award for Leeds Trinity University \(as referred to by the awarding Equality Challenge Unit’s feedback report\) **\(S1\)**. 

 The film is now complemented by a newly created Aftermath Toolkit which gives organisations a framework through which to discuss the issues raised in the film. The film premiere \(at Leeds Trinity in 2019\) received extensive media coverage regionally and nationally **\(S2, S3\)**. Based on our experience at LTU, the screening of the film enables and provokes constructive discussions about racial micro\-aggressions among students and between students and the institution. Due to the visibility gained by the film, a number of universities have already booked screenings within their institutions and are planning to use it as an educational tool. Universities include, Leeds Beckett University – intended January 2021 \(both postponed due to Covid\-19\), University of London UCL, Falmouth University, Durham University, Kingston University of Art and Norwich University of the Arts. Furthermore, it was screened to the executive team of Salford University on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of December 2020. 

 *Re:Tension* has also been used by the Fashion Academics Creating Equality \(FACE\) as part of their FACE N.S.S. campaign: https://www.weareface.uk/about\-us. The film was also presented at the EDI Conference – Advance HE, 19 March 2020, addressing issues of racial abuse in HE in the UK. Re:Tension is still at an early stage of dissemination \(due to Covid\) so we believe that its impact value will increase over the coming years. 

 In addition, the film has influenced the design and delivery of the new 30 credit programmes recently launched within MFC, focussing on equality and BAME student involvement. This was achieved through regular discussions with students and with the effort of the University’s BAME network in decolonialising the curriculum putting in place workshops bd events for academic staff. 

 The impact of our Trinity Vision production has been to work with a range of organisations to help them bring voices and issues to life through media artefacts, to support them in creative ways of bringing issues and concerns to realisation and providing them with a means of sharing ideas and generating discussion. All Trinity Vision productions are available in the public domain through Youtube. Such a platform allows a wider engagement with international audiences, easy access and large visibility. The short film *ADIRA/SADACCA – Mental Health and Me \(2019\-20\)* is a collection of conversations that gives people voices that are often not heard. Sheffield based charity ADIRA and SADACCA members discuss their thoughts and experiences of mental health, cultural identity \- breaking a cycle of misconceptions both within and towards BAME communities. This project was screened as key contribution at: “Mental Health and Me” conference organised by ADIRA in Sheffield on the 12<sup>th</sup> of October 2019. ADIRA is an organisation that organises events to raise awareness of issues affecting the black community in Sheffield, in particular in relation to mental health. The video on the Youtube’s Trinity Vision channel has, currently, 200\+ views **\(S5\)**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 An exercise and lifestyle intervention for young people \(aged 16\-25\) experiencing a first episode psychosis, developed in partnership between an interdisciplinary research team at the University of Worcester and Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust, has been shown to bring both economic benefits for service providers and significant health benefits for users. The intervention has been rolled out across Worcestershire by a dedicated team \(and extended to all outpatient mental health service users\) but has also been adopted more widely in the UK and internationally thanks to a coordinated good practice dissemination programme. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Researchers in Exercise Science \(Peters and Griffiths\) have brought their research expertise to the evaluation of physical activity interventions over a period of 10\+ years. Peters was part of a multidisciplinary team, funded by local government \(Grant 1\) to evaluate child weight management interventions in the West Midlands. The results of this evaluation highlighted the limitations of the interventions and set out recommendations for future commissioning to ensure increased effectiveness \(Reference 1\). 

 Peters was subsequently commissioned to evaluate a further PA intervention with Griffiths \(Grant 2\), the final report for which was published in 2013. The findings of this study again highlighted the ineffectiveness of the intervention but also pointed the way forward for future interventions, with emphasis on the need to adopt a multicomponent approach that draws support from across multiple sectors and environments and to take full account of the socio\-cultural context in community\-based interventions \(Reference 2\). 

 Subsequently, bringing the findings from earlier research on PA interventions, Griffiths became part of the interdisciplinary team which developed and evaluated, through Health Foundation funding \(Grant 3\), an exercise and lifestyle intervention for young people who have recently experience first episode psychosis. The SHAPE intervention consisted of a 12\-week programme, with weekly, 90\-minute sessions comprising a healthy behaviour education session, followed by a facilitated exercise session. 27 participants were recruited to the pilot. Anthropometric data from participants was collected at baseline, 12 weeks, and 12 months post\-intervention. Health behaviours and clinical measurements were assessed at baseline and 12 months. 

 Mean baseline data suggests participants were at an increased health risk on entry to the program, with elevated values in mean body mass index \(BMI; 70% overweight/obese\), waist circumference, resting heart rate, and triglycerides. 50% reported smoking daily, 64% ate less than 5 fruits/vegetables per day, and 52% of participants were prescribed highly obesogenic antipsychotic medications \(i.e., Olanzapine\). At 12 weeks and 12 months, contrary to expectations that these would be elevated, no changes were observed in mean BMI, waist circumference or any other clinical variable \(p > 0.05\). At 12 months, participants reported a positive impact on health behaviours including improved diet, increased physical activity levels, and cessation of substance use, alcohol use, and smoking. Focus groups captured participant experiences, engagement with and satisfaction with the program, including challenges/barriers to program adherence. Overall, the research showed that the programme supported participants to attenuate their physical health risk which was sustained at 12 months follow up \(Reference 3\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The evaluation of the SHAPE programme \(Source A\) showed the clear clinical benefits of the intervention. The programme: 

-  effectively supported weight maintenance 

-  reduced harmful lifestyle behaviours such as tobacco and alcohol use 

-  increased physical activity levels. 

 An economic evaluation of the programme \(Source B\) highlighted a wide range of potential costs savings derived from: 

-  improved clinical outcomes for users 

-  improved “quality of life years” for users \(QALY\) 

 Following the success of the pilot programme, in 2017 Worcestershire Clinical Commissioning Group extended the delivery of the SHAPE intervention to all outpatient mental health service users in the county and introduced three new permanent job roles \(Physical Health Lead, Physical Activity Health Coordinator, Physical Activity Support Worker\) to oversee, deliver and support the delivery of the SHAPE intervention across Worcestershire at a cost of £70,000 \(Source C\). The introduction of the programme, with associated referral processes, has enabled the Trust to improve their collection of physical and mental health data, with associated benefits for service users, but also Trust performance against nationally identified performance measures, e.g. CQUINs, and national initiatives, e.g. Making Every Contact Count; Don’t just screen, intervene \(Source C\). 

 The ongoing delivery of the programme was supported by the SHAPE project team through: 

-  the development of a new clinical health assessment form to standardise screening, now used as part of the standard clinical assessment process in Worcestershire. 

-  the design and delivery of a one day training course entitled ‘Physical Health Training for Mental Health Nurses’ which provides an overview of the NHS Commissioning for Quality and Innovation \(CQUIN\) responsibilities and training for physical health assessments \(blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference\) for mental health care professionals to assess and monitor patient physical health \(Source D\). 

 The SHAPE team received an additional £30,000 funding from a Health Foundation *Spreading Improvement* grant to disseminate further the findings of the project and the resources developed. This supported the development of a ‘mySHAPE’ website to provide patients, carers, providers and commissioners online access to physical health care information for individuals with psychosis and to give healthcare providers free access to all SHAPE intervention programme materials, allowing them to deliver the SHAPE programme in their region. 

 The SHAPE team adopted a wider dissemination programme which saw them deliver to both academic and practitioner audiences regionally, nationally and internationally. This included: NHS National Learning Network \(April 2015\); Health Services Journal \(HSJ\) Value in Healthcare Congress \(May 2016\); American College of Sports Medicine Annual Meeting, Boston, USA \(June 2016\); IEPA 10th International Conference on Early Intervention in Mental Health, Milan, Italy \(October 2017\); West Midlands Early Intervention Psychiatry regional network \(March 2017\); NICE Shared Learning Awards \(June 2017\). 

 The SHAPE intervention has been recognised in the NICE Shared Learning Database which underlines how the intervention addresses recent NICE guidance and quality standards \-NICE CG178, NICE CG155, NICE QS80, NICE QS102 \(Source E\). The intervention is also highlighted in the King’s Fund learning network for *Integrated Physical and Mental Health* \(Source F\). Further, the intervention was identified as a key area of evidence in the British Association for Psychopharmacology \(BAP\) Guidelines \(co\-authored by Jo Smith\) on the management of weight gain, metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular risk associated with psychosis and antipsychotic drug treatment \(Source G\). 

 The SHAPE programme has now been delivered \(and continues to be delivered, including online during the Covid pandemic\) in a number of NHS trusts across the Midlands: 

-  North and South Worcestershire \(Worcester, Malvern, Evesham, Kidderminster, Redditch, Bromsgrove\) 

-  Dudley and Walsall 

-  Hereford \(in partnership with a local fitness centre provider \(Halo\) and offered to service users from a range of different adult mental health services \(not restricted to the FEP / EI service\) 

-  Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust 

 The SHAPE programme has thus been delivered to 38 groups of service users across 4 NHS trusts in the West Midlands. 

 SHAPE has also informed the development of a similar programmes nationally, e.g. in the Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, and internationally, in Australia and Portugal. This wider impact on the SHAPE programme is articulated by Dr David Shiers, lead for the National Early Intervention in Psychosis Programme \(2004\-2010\), who states: “the SHAPE programme continues to play an important role in influencing other healthcare professionals within EIP services, made a compelling case for how services can help tackle this health inequality by addressing health risks in the critical first few years of psychosis and its treatment” \(Source H\). 

 To sum up, the research described in section 2 has had the following impacts on health and wellbeing: 

-  the development of a new lifestyle intervention trialled with users which demonstrated a positive outcome for users and healthcare providers alike 

-  informed decisions taken by a health service and improved provision of health services 

-  influenced the content of CPD for health professionals 

-  raised awareness of the importance of exercise in the treatment of mental health and early cardio\-metabolic risk for young people with FEP

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The research of McCleave and her colleagues at Queen’s University Belfast on the significance of Irish writer and polymath Thomas Moore to European cultural exchange in the 19<sup>th</sup> century has stimulated interest in Moore and enhanced knowledge regarding the promotion and appreciation of his work across Europe. Following a major exhibition on Moore at the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, this research has had a demonstrable impact on curatorial practice and the exhibition has changed visitor perceptions about Moore. An accompanying radio documentary about Moore, broadcast on RTE, reached over 100,000 listeners. Following this broadcast, the British Museum used a project exhibit in a major exhibition entitled ‘Inspired by the East’. This exhibition was due to transfer to the Islamic Arts Museum in Malaysia in 2020 but this was delayed due to the Covid\-19 pandemic.

-  **Underpinning research** 

 McCleave is a leading participant in the 21<sup>st</sup> century revival of Thomas Moore, demonstrating the extent and significance of his cultural impact across Europe during the 19<sup>th</sup> century. In order to document and interrogate Moore’s significance to this cultural exchange, McCleave, together with Professor Brian Caraher \(then a QUB Professor in English\) commissioned and co\-edited a volume of essays entitled *Thomas Moore and Romantic Inspiration* which was published in 2017. In this volume, 14 authors made the case for a contemporary re\-evaluation of Thomas Moore as a figure of artistic and cultural significance, in Europe and further afield \( **1**\). As well as an introduction by Caraher and McCleave, the edition features an essay by Roberts on Moore’s poem *Lalla Rookh*. Drawing on themes that are integral to the larger project, Roberts’ essay explores the complex orientalist impulses in the lyrics and prose sections of the poem and reads these as an exchange between Anglo\-Irish cultural identity and Indian historical writing \( **1**\). 

 In September 2015, McCleave \(with Dr Tríona O’Hanlon, QUB\) embarked on a major two\-year study of Thomas Moore’s cultural impact in Europe, funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme \( **2\)**. ‘Europe’s Reception of the Irish Melodies and National Airs: Thomas Moore in Europe’ \(Project ERIN\) was designed to reveal the breadth of Moore’s cultural reach, with reference to European art music published between 1808 and 1880. In particular, the project uses Moore’s work to examine a wider European fascination with the ‘orient’. In tandem with Roberts’ examination of the lyrics of *Lalla Rookh* \( **1**\), and further demonstrating the interdisciplinary \(English\-Music\) collaboration at the heart of this project, ERIN explored Moore’s role in promoting this fascination by featuring little\-known music inspired by Moore’s *Lalla Rookh*. As part of Project ERIN, McCleave and O’Hanlon produced sixty blog posts, eight digital collections of images and narrative exhibitions, and an online catalogue of 1250 music imprints from eight European libraries. This is the only known fully functioning digital resource dedicated to Thomas Moore’s work; the catalogue and these collections are unique resources that enable readers to discover Moore’s impact on European culture \(music, literature, fine art\) – and also how he stimulated further cultural works dedicated to ‘oriental’ themes. The ERIN website also features 41 newly commissioned recordings of rarely heard music to Moore’s lyrics. Collectively these outputs offer a uniquely enriched and curated documentation of Moore’s role in European cultural exchange during the 19<sup>th</sup> century \( **2**\). 

 As part of Project ERIN, O’Hanlon also co\-ordinated a radio documentary, ‘An oriental romance: Thomas Moore’s Lalla Rookh’ for which she and McCleave were contributors and helped devise and shape the content. This was first broadcast by RTÉ in September 2017 \( **4**\). McCleave and O’Hanlon also commissioned and co\-edited a volume of scholarly essays – *The Reputations of Thomas Moore* \( **3**\). These demonstrate Moore’s significance in the cultural networks of four European countries – Ireland, England, Germany and Greece – and also in Canada, the USA, and India. The editors wrote two chapters which drew on the catalogue and collections collated for Project ERIN. McCleave’s chapter reveals how communities and networks functioned as conduits for disseminating Moore across Europe. O’Hanlon’s contribution exposes the community loyalties that drove Moore\-related activities in Dublin. Developing these themes of transnationalism and cosmopolitanism, Caraher’s essay explores the circulation and reception of Moore’s poetry in the United States in the late nineteenth\-century as part of an emerging Irish cultural diaspora \( **3**\). 

 In 2019, McCleave drew on Project ERIN and on the collection of the Royal Irish Academy to create another public\-facing output. She was the principal curator for an exhibition entitled ‘Discovering Thomas Moore: Ireland in nineteenth\-century Europe.’ The exhibition, which was held at the RIA from June 2019 to February 2020, was designed to demonstrate the European impact of Moore’s work more broadly than previous outputs, and so featured his fictional and non\-fictional prose as well as musical works \( **6**\). To accompany the exhibition, McCleave wrote a 22\-page guide which contextualised the exhibition’s contents, highlighting the findings of previous research outputs on the extent and nature of Moore’s cultural impact in Europe \( **5**\). This was published in June 2019 \(1000 copies\) with a later reprint and legal deposit copies were sent to libraries in the UK and Ireland.

 **Details of the impact** 

 The research has raised public awareness of Moore’s cultural significance during the 19th century and brought Moore’s work to new audiences in Ireland and elsewhere – prompting members of the public to engage with Moore's work and to listen to his music. Perceptions of Moore have been changed \[ **A, G**\], while McCleave’s research has had a demonstrable impact on the curatorial practice of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin. A radio documentary about Moore, broadcast on RTE, reached an estimated audience of over 100,000 listeners \[ **B**\]. Following this documentary, an exhibit came to the attention of the British Museum and was subsequently included in an exhibition entitled ‘Inspired by the East’ which ran from October 2019 to January 2020. 

 **Developing new audiences for Moore:** The research has reached tens of thousands of people in Ireland and Britain \[ **A, B**\]. The specific impact of this research is tied to three primary outputs: the radio documentary, the Royal Irish Academy exhibition, and the inclusion of a Project ERIN recording in a major exhibition of the British Museum. The radio documentary was initially broadcast by the RTÉ classical music and arts radio station, Lyric FM, in September 2017. It was broadcast on the station’s weekly documentary slot, The Lyric Feature, to mark the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the publication of *Lalla Rookh* \( **B**\). The programme was broadcast again on two further occasions, on Easter Sunday, 2018, and in November, 2019, when it formed part of the station’s prestigious Opera Night slot, which features a live broadcast of the Wexford Opera Festival \( **B**\). The documentary’s producer acknowledges the key role played by McCleave and O’Hanlon in shaping the content of the broadcast: 

 The input of Tríona O’Hanlon, through ERIN, was invaluable…The programme could not have been made without this input, as well as the expert advice I received on versions of the songs and other music to feature in the programme, both from \[O’Hanlon and McCleave\] and the access \[they\] facilitated to performers who made new live recordings especially for the broadcast at Queen’s University \( **B**\). 

 While specific listening figures are not available, it can be assumed that the documentary would have reached, at a minimum, tens of thousands of listeners in Ireland and, quite possibly thousands more internationally. RTÉ’s average listening and online figures for this slot suggest some 80,000 people would have heard the programme through one of the first two broadcasts, with thousands more hearing its final broadcast in Ireland and internationally. \( **B**\). As the programme’s producer notes, ‘the programme will potentially have reached a much vaster audience worldwide than we could ever have imagined \[…\] this programme is reaching many, many more listeners than any programme I have ever worked on previously’ \( **B**\). Moreover, many in that audience would probably have been previously unfamiliar with the work of Thomas Moore. 

 One output from the research gained a new and large audience after being featured in a high\-profile exhibition at the British Museum. Following the broadcast of the RTÉ documentary, a recording from Project ERIN which featured in the programme came to the attention of the team who were curating ‘Inspired by the East’, a major exhibition which explored the impact of the Islamic world on Western art and which was staged by the Museum from October 2019 to January 2020. The team decided to include the recording in question – G. Kiallmark’s setting of ‘Araby’s Daughter’ from Moore’s *Lalla Rookh* – in the exhibition \( **B, C, E**\). The exhibition was seen by more than 65,000 people \( **E**\). Visiting the exhibition in January 2020, the programme producer reports that she ‘had to queue for ten minutes to get a chance to listen to the recording Araby’s Daughter’, suggesting the exhibit was proving popular with visitors \( **B\)**. 

 The exhibition was a joint initiative with the largest museum of Islamic Art in South East Asia, the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia \(IAMM\) in Kuala Lumpur. Originally, the exhibition was scheduled to go on display at the IAMM from June to October 2020. However, due to the Covid\-19 pandemic, the exhibition’s IAMM run was postponed \( **C**\). 

 **Enhancing public understanding of Moore**: The research has not only promoted public engagement with Moore’s work; it has also raised public awareness of Moore’s role and status as an artist in Ireland and Europe. This is evident in responses to the ‘Discovering Thomas Moore: Ireland in Nineteenth\-century Europe’ exhibition at the Royal Irish Academy, which ran from June 2019 to February 2020 and attracted in the region of 3,250 visitors \( **A**\). 

 Underscoring the transformative potential of the exhibition, the Academy’s Librarian stated: ‘The Moore exhibition proved popular and I can definitively state that it introduced a new audience to Moore’ \( **A**\). Indeed, the results of a small\-scale survey of exhibition visitors \(n = 29\) indicate that many visitors were non\-academics; only a third \(9\) identified themselves as academics or retired academics, while two\-thirds \(19\) said they were either local residents or tourists \( **H**\). Most respondents \(21\) said the exhibition had changed their perception of the breadth of Moore’s contribution to 19<sup>th</sup> century literature and culture. More than three\-fifths \(18\) also said that the exhibition had changed their perception of the extent to which Moore’s work was of interest across Europe at the time. As one respondent observed: 

 There is so much I did not know about Thomas Moore \- especially from the oriental aspects. The ERIN project is an excellent way to capture the wide span of information on his works. 

 Another commented: 

 I knew something \[of Moore as\] I have sung \[his\] songs but this has revealed so much more, Moore as scholar and bibliophile as well as musician. \( **D**\) 

 Drawing on additional visitor comments, The Academy’s Librarian further notes: 

 ‘People already aware of Moore commented that the exhibition shed a completely new light on his *oeuvre* and its reception in Europe and beyond. Visitors with a musical background, incl. two young composers, who had found the exhibition serendipitously, were anxious to follow up on Moore’s musical output and influence’ \( **A**\). 

 In addition, some two\-thirds of the respondents \(19\) said the exhibition had inspired them to read some of Moore’s writing, while a similar proportion \(18\) said they now wished to listen to or play some of Moore’s music. \( **D**\) 

 **Impact on curatorial practice**: The research had a beneficial impact on curatorial practice and exhibitions programming at the Royal Irish Academy. When it received McCleave’s exhibition proposal, the Academy had already held two exhibitions about Thomas Moore within the preceding 17 years. However, according to its Librarian, the Academy opted, nevertheless, to stage ‘Discovering Thomas Moore’, in part, because “… Dr McCleave’s proposal involved new perspectives on Moore’s work and influence abroad, as well as the external influences to which he was exposed ..’ and because the exhibition provided ‘..the opportunity to engage with Dr McCleave as curator and the first\-rate scholarly input which this brought to the resource’ \( **A**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Cystic Fibrosis is a life\-limiting condition affecting 10,500 people in the UK. Patients are usually prescribed three nebuliser treatments each day, however only 36% of treatments are taken. Non\-adhering patients are more likely to need hospital treatments, which disrupt their lives and result in higher costs. Arden's research informed the development and refinement of an intervention ‘CFHealthHub’. This intervention is now being used in clinical practice at more than three\-fifths of sites in the UK, with more than 1400 patients registered by 2020, and significant NHS funds committed to its roll\-out. It is being used by patients to self\-manage their treatments and has increased treatment adherence by up to 18%. It has changed the practice of health professionals and the delivery of services within the NHS, generating health gains \(0.17 QALYs\) and offering cost savings of £2.5m per year. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Cystic Fibrosis \(CF\) affects 10,500 people \(6000 adults\) in the UK, with patients experiencing life\-limiting conditions and typically dying at 31 years of age. Patients are usually prescribed three treatments a day, taken through a nebuliser, which delivers medications directly to their lungs as a fine mist. Good adherence is vital for treatment effectiveness. However objective measurement shows only 36% of prescribed nebuliser treatments are taken. 

 The development of an intervention to promote nebuliser adherence in adults with CF was undertaken as part of a NIHR funded programme grant \(total grant £2.5 million\). The project team included Arden, as lead for the behaviour change strand, Martin Wildman \(Sheffield Teaching Hospitals; clinical lead\), Alicia O’Cathain \(University of Sheffield\) and academics from universities including Sheffield, Manchester and Queen’s University Belfast. Arden was instrumental in the development of the intervention in the following three areas. 

####  Identifying Key Barriers to Adherence 

 Interviews with a cohort of CF patients led to the identification of key barriers to adherence, with important differences between high and low adherers \[ **R1**\]. This was the first study to use participants’ personal objective adherence data as a prompt within an interview, to assess specific barriers and facilitators to treatment\-taking, rather than relying on subjective recall of adherence \(which is likely to be inaccurate\). The research determined that the barriers and facilitators were highly variable, indicating that a one\-size\-fits\-all intervention would not be appropriate. It was also found that there were key differences between higher and lower adherers, including that higher adherers had routines and habits for treatment\-taking. Further analysis of the same interviews explored how participants used ‘forgetting' in their explanations of non\-adherence. Low adherers utilised 'forgetting' to present a socially acceptable reason for non\-adherence, to help to normalise their behaviour, given that they knew they should adhere \[ **R2**\]. This emphasised the importance of contextualising explanations with objectively\-measured behavioural data and the importance of avoiding judgement in discussions about non\-adherence. 

####  Co\-producing the Intervention with Patients and Clinicians using a Systematic Approach 

 The prototype CFHealthHub intervention was developed and launched in 2016 and comprised two parts: i\) a web platform and smartphone app providing information and behaviour change tools that can be accessed by patients and health professionals, and ii\) an intervention manual and training programme for health professionals to work alongside patients; this uses the web platform content and behaviour change tools to support patient adherence. The prototype was developed based on the barriers and facilitators established in **R1**, where Arden identified evidence\-based behaviour change techniques to address each specific barrier. One of the techniques included was a type of coping plan called a volitional help sheet, shown to be effective in Arden’s previous research \[ **R6**\]. The intervention was co\-produced and iteratively developed with patients and clinicians, with changes made in response to interview feedback and monitored use of CFHealthHub \[ **R3**\]. 

####  Ensuring that the Intervention Worked in Practice 

 A research study ran in three UK sites, which randomised CF patients into ‘intervention’ and ‘usual\-care’ groups. Measures taken pre\-intervention and at five\-month follow up found that the intervention was acceptable to patients and that those in the ‘intervention’ group showed a 10% increase in adherence \[ **R4**\]. A process evaluation identified 14 key changes to the intervention procedures that were needed to maximise the chance of intervention success \[ **R5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The CFHealthHub intervention has had an impact on patients, service delivers and practitioners \- delivering health, financial and skills benefits. 

####  Benefits to Patients with Cystic Fibrosis 

 Research data showed that the intervention is successful in supporting patients to increase and importantly to maintain increased adherence to medication over a 12\-month period. On average patients who received the intervention had 10% higher adherence than those receiving usual care. The difference was even more substantial in patients who started the trial with low \(26\-50%\) or moderate \(51\-75%\) adherence and received the intervention. Their adherence was 18% and 15% greater respectively than with usual care \[ **E1**\]. 

 Patients who receive the intervention reported decreased concerns about medication, lower perceived effort of treatment and increased habit strength. They also report lower perceived treatment burden, which is a top research priority in CF according to a recent priority setting exercise by the James Lind Alliance. Therefore, while patients are taking more of their treatment because of the intervention, this is not negatively impacting on their perceived treatment burden \[ **E1**\]. 

 The intervention also enhanced the patient experience. Interviews with patients indicated that they found CFHealthHub helpful in supporting their adherence: "" *It's helped me find a pattern, which I didn't have before*"" and “\[it’s\] *drastically improved my using of treatments, my overall health and my understanding of CF*”. Patients also appreciated the support they received from health professionals who delivered the intervention: “ *It was good to have that one\-on\-one aspect and it kind of gave me the confidence to then continue without as many meetings*"" \[ **E2**\]. 

 Increased patient involvement in shaping the intervention has resulted in a usable system that patients are invested in engaging with to improve their adherence \[ **E2**\]. Patients chose to use the CFHealthHub system during the research \[ **E1**\] and subsequently when it became available in clinical practice. Between August 2019 and December 2020, patients logged into CFHealthHub 28,135 times in total \[ **E3**\]. 

####  Benefits to the Delivery of Cystic Fibrosis Services 

 CFHealthHub provides a tool that can easily be integrated into care pathways to inform medical decision\-making and to increase adherence in CF patients. NHS England offered NHS Trusts across England £8 million of investment for the intervention to be rolled\-out within care pathways for adults with CF as part of its 2019/20 Prescribed Specialised Services Commissioning for Quality and Innovation \(CQUIN\) scheme \[ **E4**\]. This funding supported the adoption of CFHealthHub in 16 CF centres in England \(Barts, Birmingham, Blackpool, Bristol, Exeter, Frimley, Leicester, Newcastle, Norfolk/Norwich, Nottingham, Oxford, Plymouth, Sheffield, Southampton, Stoke, Truro and York\). CFHealthHub has also been adopted in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh under separate arrangements with the devolved nations. CFHealthHub is therefore currently used in 19 out of 26 centres in the UK, with 1416 patients registered by the end of 2020, representing around 24% of adults with CF \[ **E5**\]. 

 An NIHR economic analysis of the intervention calculated that it generated health gains of 0.17 additional QALYs and cost savings of £1,790 per patient per year, compared with usual care. The savings are from both reduce medicine wastage and lower the risk of exacerbations that lead to hospitalisation. This is therefore offering estimated savings to CF service delivers of £2.5 million annually \(£1,790 average saving x 1416 patients already registered\) \[ **E1**\]. 

 The coronavirus pandemic posed a particular problem for the care of people with CF, who were classified as clinically extremely vulnerable and were asked to shield during the early part of the pandemic. CFHealthHub was recommended by NICE as an innovation that allowed remote delivery of care, with virtual clinics supporting people and providing them with behaviour change tools to self\-manage their condition while they were shielding: 

 *“CFHealthHub enables remote monitoring and virtual clinics for people with CF. This is critical for CF monitoring during the COVID\-19 pandemic”* \[ **E6**\]. 

 The intervention has also been adapted for use in paediatric settings in the UK, with the first feasibility study having begun in Southampton \[ **E7**\]. 

 There has been international interest in CFHealthHub, with CF centres in the USA and France having expressed an interest in adopting it \[ **E7**\]. 

####  Benefits to Health Practitioners 

 Health professionals delivering adherence support to patients, including physiotherapists, pharmacists, nurses and psychologists, have benefitted from CFHealthHub. Practitioners have increased their skills, knowledge and capability for supporting patient adherence using CFHealthHub. Arden has delivered training in behaviour change and the use of CFHealthHub behaviour change strategies and tools to over 100 health professionals working in CF \[ **E8**\]. 

 Health professionals found the CFHealthHub enhanced their decision making and enabled a more patient\-led approach within their practice. A survey of 85 healthcare professional conducted in November/December 2020 found that 95.3% agreed that CFHealthHub supported an open honest conversation that improved the patient\-practitioner relationship, while 90.6% agreed that CFHealthHub provided tools to empower patients to self\-care. \[ **E9**\]. Interviews with health professionals confirmed that it significantly changed and improved their practice. One reported that: 

 *“It changes your whole practice. I think you more ask open ended questions, rather than making assumptions. I think you learn different ways… and making that acceptable, and then something that you do together, is different than you sitting in a clinic and saying ‘well why aren’t you doing the nebuliser, it takes five minutes’*”. Another acknowledged that: *“It has definitely changed my practice in terms of the way that I approach things, it…\[has become\] more patient led now, rather than me firing questions and getting the answer that they think I want back.”* \[ **E9**\]. 

 Experts who reviewed CFHealthHub as part of the NICE briefing stated that *“The innovative aspect of CFHealthHub is the included behaviour change tools*”, and that *“CFHealthHub had improved clinical consultations by enabling…honest discussion about the data…how the patient may be struggling with the burden of treatment…and how the CF team can support them*.” \[ **E6**\]. 

 Health professionals use CFHealthHub as a regular part of their practice. Currently 412 clinicians across 19 UK sites are registered to use CFHealthHub. Between August 2019 and December 2020 there were an average of 1,517 clinician log\-ins per month, during which healthcare professionals looked at patients’ adherence data pages 34,541 times in total \[ **E3**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The numerical algorithms, datasets and outputs of the LISFLOOD\-FP flood inundation model developed by the University of Bristol’s Hydrology Research Group have been adopted by >1600 non\-governmental organisations, multinational companies, governments, \(re\)insurers, specialist risk modelling firms and non\-commercial users serving the world’s flood risk management sector to protect assets worth >USD1.35 trillion and the infrastructure used by billions of people. 

 The impact has been realised directly and through the team’s start\-up company Fathom \(12 staff in 2020, with turnover >USD2 million\) which has created the first high\-resolution simulations of continental and global flood dynamics, hazards and risks. 

 The work has improved flood risk management and decision making globally, resulting in avoided losses, reduced risk to populations, better asset management and the creation of numerous jobs in the hazard risk analysis sector since August 2013. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2008, there has been a concerted effort to develop a first generation of national\-to\-global scale flood inundation models. Prior to this, flood risk analyses were typically conducted over relatively small areas \(river reaches a few 10s of km long\) using detailed models and local data, such as hydrometry and ground survey, collected specifically for the purpose. Flood inundation modelling for larger domains or for regions outside the handful of developed countries with good local data was effectively prevented by: \(i\) the computational cost of running highly detailed flood simulations globally; \(ii\) the low suitability of global terrain data sets for flood modelling; \(iii\) the lack of suitable data detailing global river widths; \(iv\) the absence of methods to calculate extreme flood magnitudes for all global rivers; and \(v\) the need to automate the model building process. However, many problems in flood science and management explicitly demand large scale, national and even global views of hazard and risk. These include insurance and reinsurance pricing, corporate supply chain and risk management, environmental rating and risk analysis of global investment portfolios, financial authority stress testing, humanitarian response to disasters, climate change analysis and decisions on national flood defence spending levels. 

 Ground\-breaking research, conducted by the Hydrology Research Group at the University of Bristol \(UoB\) between 2008 and 2020, has addressed and provided solutions to each of these previously intractable problems and has led to the development of the first ever high resolution \(3 arcsecond, approximately 100m\) simulations of global flood dynamics that have predictive skill down to these scales **\[1\].** 

 The developments pioneered by this group that contributed to these high\-resolution global flood simulations were: 

-  In 2010, the researchers published a set of highly efficient numerical solutions derived from shallow water theory that could be used by flood inundation models **\[1\]**. This numerical solution was between 100 and 1000x faster than the code it replaced and has subsequently been developed for implementation on high performance computing within the LISFLOOD\-FP model to achieve a further 10x speed\-up. 

-  The team developed code to automatically create and conduct wide area, high\-resolution simulations using only globally available datasets **\[2, 3\]**. 

-  Working with a team from Japan \(University of Tokyo, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency\), they developed bespoke and open source variants of NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission \(SRTM\) global terrain dataset expressly designed for flood inundation modelling using tests and diagnostics developed by the UoB team **\[4\]**.  SRTM is the current global benchmark terrain dataset, but prior to this work contained significant artefacts, errors and noise which rendered it unsuitable for inundation prediction. 

-  The development of new methods to predict the probability distribution of extreme river flow anywhere on the global river network to provide the boundary conditions for global inundation simulations **\[5\]**. 

-  The production of global, open source databases for river width and hydrography – key parameters in hydrodynamic river simulations – which could then be applied to continental and global scale river modelling. This was done with collaborators from University of Tokyo and University of North Carolina, with UoB researchers involved in all aspects of the work **\[6\]**. 

-  The above components were combined within an automated model build and execution framework that allowed regional to global scale hazard simulation by the hydrodynamic model LISFLOOD\-FP **\[1\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of this research is as follows: 

### 1.  A new business was created in November 2013, co\-founded by Bates and Neal, to apply the equation sets and algorithms in the underpinning research \[1\-6\] to produce flood risk analytics for organisations around the world. 

 This business, Fathom \( [www.fathom.global](http://www.fathom.global/)\), has so far created 12 permanent jobs and will generate turnover in excess of USD2 million in 2020 **\[a\]**. Using these equation sets and algorithms, Fathom have developed: \(i\) global 90m resolution flood hazard layers \(i.e. maps of water depths at this scale\) for 10 different return periods, from 1 in 5 years to 1 in 1,000; \(ii\) a similar dataset for the US using higher resolution data at 30m resolution; \(iii\) a set of 100,000 years of realistic flood patterns over the US that can be used to estimate flood losses; and \(iv\) a US catastrophe risk model for flood by combining developments ii and iii. Fathom also works in collaboration with technology companies Simplitium \( [https://www.simplitium.com/](https://www.simplitium.com/)\) and Oasis \( [https://oasislmf.org/](https://oasislmf.org/)\) to implant their data products within standard risk modelling platforms which enable insurers to model portfolio losses using the Oasis open loss modelling framework. This was the first implementation of flood hazard data within Oasis over large areas. 

 The work has been recognised by industry prizes, including ""Best piece of research / evaluation / validation"" at the London Catastrophe Modelling Association 2020 awards \( [www.catinsight.co.uk/ awards](http://www.catinsight.co.uk/%20awards)\) and the 2019 Allianz Climate Risk Research Award to Dr Ollie Wing, who at the time was a joint Fathom/UoB employee \( [www.allianz.com/en/sustainability/low\-carbon\-economy/climate\-risk\-research\-award/meet\-our\-finalists1.html](http://www.allianz.com/en/sustainability/low-carbon-economy/climate-risk-research-award/meet-our-finalists1.html)\). 

1.  **The insurance industry, blue\-chip companies, NGOs and regulators around the world have benefitted from the global flood hazard and risk datasets developed through Fathom Ltd since November 2013 and underpinned by the research conducted at the University of Bristol.**  Examples include: 

1.  US, UK and Asian insurers, including Aon, Canopius, Chaucer, Sompo International, Hiscox and Trans Re, who use Fathom’s data directly in the pricing of flood risk for millions of assets worth at least USD1.35 trillion \(Hiscox: USD1.2 trillion; Sompo: USD134.5 billion; data from other companies withheld as commercial in confidence\). This resulted in payable annual insurance premiums of at least USD1.5 billion \(Trans Re, USD1 billion; Sompo, USD500 million; data from other companies withheld as commercial in confidence\) **\[a, b\]**.  Fathom data are also used by these insurers and re\-insurers to identify new market opportunities and to better understand their risk and exposure **\[b\]**. Examples include risk assessment and underwriting for the US National Flood Insurance Programme \(NFIP\) by Hiscox Ltd. and for consistent flood risk underwriting for all types of insurance across all locations by Sompo International. The data have allowed insurers to “ *improve both underwriting and portfolio management practices by providing greater certainty in the quantification of a critical catastrophe risk*” \(Global Risk Analytics Director, Sompo International\), make “ *more informed underwriting decisions, manage downside risk and develop new products*” \(Head of Digital Product, Canopius\) and “ *more holistically approach client’s flood risk management and quantification needs*” \(Head of Client Management, Aon\).  As a result of the data, Hiscox have been able to generate “ *very strong growth year on year in our flood business*” \(Group Head of Catastrophe Research\). Numerous insurers state that the strong basis of Fathom’s work in the peer\-reviewed science conducted at UoB and the close connection between UoB and Fathom are key reasons for their adoption of these datasets **\[b\]**. 

1.  First Street Foundation, *“a non\-profit research and technology group committed to defining America’s flood risk”*, who use the data to calculate the past, present, and future flood risk of every home and property in the United States and who make these data freely available to the public and researchers **\[c\]**. Most Americans rely on the Federal Emergency Management Agency \(FEMA\) for flood risk information, yet recent and repeated flooding events across the US have destroyed thousands of homes classified as low risk in the FEMA database.  Seventy\-five per cent of FEMA maps are outdated and fail to account for changing environmental factors, like rising sea levels and changing precipitation patterns. As a result, millions of Americans are unaware of their true flood risk and are consequently unprepared. The First Street Foundation aims to correct this knowledge imbalance and in doing so heighten awareness of both flood risk and climate change.  Data access is provided through: \(1\) Flood Factor \( [https://floodfactor.com/](https://floodfactor.com/)\), the Foundation’s online database and visualisation tool; \(2\) an Application Programming Interface \(or API\); and \(3\) by integrating the data within the web searches from leading online US real estate database companies, such as Realtor and Zillow. These data have also been used to determine the economic, fiscal, and social impacts of the US’s changing flood risk in the country’s first national flood risk assessment \( [https://firststreet.org/flood\-lab/research/2020\-national\-flood\-risk\-assessment\-highlights](https://firststreet.org/flood-lab/research/2020-national-flood-risk-assessment-highlights)\). *“Fathom are producing new and updated versions of their US hazard data for pluvial, fluvial, coastal and hurricane\-induced flooding that will sit at the heart of the data sets we will deliver to the US public and decision makers. In turn these data are based on the world\-leading science that your group has produced over the last decade, thereby giving us assurance that the methods have been rigorously tested and peer\-reviewed”*  \(Executive Director, First Street Foundation\) **\[c\]**. 

1.  Risk analytics companies, such as Four Twenty Seven \(a subsidiary of the ratings agency Moodys\), who offer risk information and products to investors, corporations, and governments.  Four Twenty Seven use Fathom’s data to correctly price current and future flood risk for a variety of financial sectors and instruments through on\-demand risk scoring, creation of company risk scores for investors, and analysis of sovereign risk **\[d\]**. 

1.  The World Bank, whose Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery \(GFDRR\) licenses Fathom’s global data to provide the default global source of flood hazard information for the entire Bank. The data are used in GFDRR’s web\-based ‘Think Hazard’ tool \( [http:/ /thinkhazard.org/](http://thinkhazard.org/)\), which enables over 10,000 users per month in any country to consider the impacts of flood disasters on new development projects.  Fathom data are also used in the Bank’s City Resilience Programme, which provides information on risk and resilience conditions of urban centres in Bank client countries around the world to aid intelligent planning, and in numerous projects to assess national scale flood risk in territories including Argentina, Belize, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Georgia and Armenia.  These latter studies are used by the Bank to decide on multi\-billion USD investments and loans for infrastructure and disaster resilience projects that enhance the lives of millions of people.  In total, based in part on Fathom data, the Bank disbursed nearly USD50 billion in funding in 2019 **\[e, a\]**. 

1.  Microsoft uses Fathom data to assess and manage risks to its global cloud infrastructure, including location decisions and risk mitigation actions, and to optimise service delivery during extreme events. In this way, Fathom data help protect network infrastructure worth over USD15 billion that stores over 30 trillion data objects and which is relied upon by over 400 million people **\[f\]**. 

1.  The Nature Conservancy \(TNC\), which is one of the largest environmental non\-profit organisations in the world, with annual revenues in excess of USD1 billion.  TNC is based in the US and protects over 0.5million km<sup>2</sup> of land in 79 countries across 6 continents. UoB research and Fathom data are used by TNC in their Mississippi River Basin Floodplain Prioritization Tool \( [http://fptool.org/](http://fptool.org/)\) to inform spatial decision making and floodplain management by local and regional agencies across the basin, to help guide floodplain conservation projects across the US and to develop the economic case for investment in floodplain conservation \(summarised in a paper published in Nature Sustainability by TNC and UoB authors in 2020\) **\[g\]**. 

### 1.  **Direct users of LISFLOOD\-FP model outputs and science created by the University of Bristol.** Examples since August 2013 include: 

1.  The UK’s Department of International Development \(DFID\), for whom the UoB researchers provided flood risk assessment that informed the planning and humanitarian response during cyclones Idai and Kenneth which affected Southern and East Africa in 2019. For this effort, the team provided rapid\-response real\-time forecasts of future flood inundation based on climate model ensembles created by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting and hydrology analysis by the University of Reading. This allowed flood risk maps to be disseminated to risk managers in the region 24 hours ahead of cyclone landfall, which were then updated daily during the crises. The analysis was used in the daily situation reports of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and by the Government of Mozambique to establish aid airbridges and to prioritise locations to which ground response teams should be sent **\[h\]**. The success of the process resulted in an identical study being performed for the recent cyclone Amphan, which struck Bangladesh, India and Burma in May 2020, and an ongoing contract to provide these services in the future via DFID’s Expert Advisory Call Down service. 

1.  Google, which has used the LISFLOOD\-FP algorithm blueprint **\[1, 3\]** to develop its own flood inundation forecasting model, which has been run operationally for basins in India over the last two years.  Google has already used the system to send out hundreds of flood alerts to millions of people, and is looking to expand this initiative to more basins globally and thereby improve flood risk knowledge for hundreds of millions of Google users **\[i\]**. 

1.  The Swedish Meteorology and Hydrology Institute, which uses LISFLOOD\-FP **\[1, 3\]** in Sweden’s national flood forecasting system \(SHYPE, Swedish Hydrological Predictions for the Environment\). LISFLOOD\-FP has been used to generate flood mapping for all catchments in Sweden larger than 50km<sup>2</sup> at a spatial resolution of 5m, thereby covering more than 98% of Sweden’s land surface area. This will create an archive of flood extent maps relating to different flow conditions that can be drawn from to provide real\-time predictions of future inundation extent and flood depth for use by first responders and risk managers \(e.g. for road and rail closures, evacuation decisions and deployment of temporary flood defences\) **\[j\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Misdiagnosis and undertreatment of chronic diseases places huge burdens on developing countries. Five African and Brazilian randomised trials by UEA researchers demonstrated that clinical decision tools and health care worker training significantly improved patients’ care and health, and established pioneering nurse\-led antiretroviral treatment \(ART\) for HIV in South Africa. The Practical Approach to Care Kit \(PACK\), incorporating these interventions, was delivered to all 3500 government clinics in South Africa \(population 59 million\), throughout Ethiopia \(population 112 million\), and in three regions of Nigeria. Since 2014 >12,000 health workers received PACK training and >1.9 million South Africans started nurse\-led ART, improving the health and saving the lives of millions. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Chronic diseases like tuberculosis, HIV, asthma, diabetes and hypertension are common, but often undetected, misdiagnosed and undertreated, in low and middle income countries, largely because frontline health workers lack the requisite clinical skills. In most of those countries, policies, guidelines and training typically focus on single diseases, undermining comprehensive primary care. These defects in the quality of primary health care harm the health of hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and overload already struggling health systems with severe illness and costs. 

 **2.1 Practical Approach to Lung Health in South Africa \(PALSA\)** 

 Since 2000, UEA researchers \(Bachmann, Barton and Murdoch\) have collaborated with the University of Cape Town’s Knowledge Translation Unit \(KTU\) to show that educational interventions, developed incrementally by KTU, continued to improve primary health care in low and middle income countries. This started with development of the **PALSA \(Practical Approach to Lung Health in South Africa\)** clinical guidelines and training on integrated care of tuberculosis and lung diseases, working with the World Health Organisation. PALSA guidelines used algorithmic flow charts guiding health workers to make accurate diagnoses and prescribe effective treatments, building on national policies and evidence of effectiveness. Training to use the guideline was delivered iteratively to health workers at their workplaces by KTU\-trained health ministry trainers, enabling delivery at scale. Our randomised trial showed in 2005 that PALSA increased diagnosis of tuberculosis \(by 72%\), asthma treatment \(by 90%\) and emergency referrals \(by 159%\) \[3.1\], and was cost effective. 

 **2.2. PALSA PLUS** 

 **PALSA PLUS** expanded PALSA to cover HIV, AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. Our randomised trial of PALSA PLUS showed in 2011 that it increased the diagnosis of tuberculosis by South African primary care nurses by 28%, and appropriate treatment of HIV by 17% \[3.2\]. 

 **2.3 Primary Care 101** **and** **Practical Approach to Care Kit \(PACK\)** 

 PALSA PLUS guidelines and training were expanded to cover diabetes, hypertension and depression. This intervention \- **Primary Care 101** \- was evaluated with a randomised trial which in 2016 demonstrated that it intensified treatments of diabetes by 68% in obese participants, hypertension by 44%, and cardiovascular disease by 176% \[3.3\]. 

 **PACK** **Global** was the international version of Primary Care 101, delivered at scale in Brazil, Nigeria and Ethiopia. Our randomised trial of **PACK Adult Brazil** showed in 2019 that PACK improved testing and treatment for respiratory disease \[3.4, PI Bachmann\].  The PC101 and PACK Brazil trials thus supported large scale delivery of PACK in low and middle income countries beyond South Africa. 

 **2.4 Nurse\-led initiation and monitoring of antiretroviral treatment \(ART\)** 

 **STRETCH \(Streamlining Tasks and Roles to Expand Treatment and Care for HIV\)**, was a package of guidelines, training and primary care reorganisation, enabling nurses to take over ART prescribing from doctors in South Africa. Our randomised trial of 15,500 patients with HIV showed in 2012 that nurse\-led ART, supported by STRETCH, improved patients’ health and was safe \[3.5, co\-PI Bachmann\].  Our parallel economic evaluation showed that STRETCH was cost\-effective, and affordable by other middle income countries. Our cohort study of ART rollout in South Africa showed in 2015 that ART halved tuberculosis incidence \[3.6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our REF2014 impact case study described how, in South Africa until 2013, our research led to delivery of PALSA, PALSA PLUS and Primary Care 101 \[2.1\-2.3\], and enabled nationwide expansion of antiretroviral treatment for HIV based on STRETCH \[2.4\]. Since 2014, impact has evolved and expanded. The previous four interventions were incorporated into PACK, which was further developed and delivered throughout South Africa and internationally \[5.1\-5.7\], while ART expansion continued in South Africa \[5.8\]. 

 **4.1 From Primary Care 101 to PACK in South Africa** 

 Building on our evidence that Primary Care 101 guidelines and training, and their predecessors, led to improved management of TB, HIV, respiratory disease, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, KTU developed Primary Care 101 into a comprehensive clinical decision support tool called PACK Adult \(also called Adult Primary Care \(APC\)\) \[5.1,5.2\]. PACK Adult and APC now cover the commonest and most important adult conditions, including 40 symptoms, and 20 communicable and non\-communicable diseases. In 2015 the South African National Department of Health launched its Ideal Clinic programme, based on PACK and APC, aiming to integrate and strengthen chronic disease management in all 3500 primary care clinics in the country. These clinics are the main source of health care for 50 million South Africans without health insurance. Evidence that a clinic uses PACK or APC is an Ideal Clinic audit standard \[5.2\]. Four South African nursing schools and three medical schools added PACK to their undergraduate curricula since 2014 \[5.1\]. 

 **4.2 PACK extended to Brazil, Nigeria and Ethiopia** 

 KTU adapted PACK for international dissemination. PACK Global Adult is the prototype, which is then adapted for each country. KTU updates the guides annually, using the latest evidence about accurate diagnosis and effective treatment \(supported by the BMJ Evidence Centre\). By 2020, over 185,000 guides had been distributed and 30,000 health workers trained in 6 countries, \(including >12,000 trained and 3 new countries involved since 2014\) \[5.1\]. 

 Since 2015, PACK Global Adult has been marketed internationally to government and private providers, in partnership with BMJ Publishing Group. PACK Global Adult is delivered to each country through a comprehensive localisation package which includes: i\) PACK Adult Guide \(mentoring local partners to adapt content to match local policies and priorities, with annual updating\), ii\) training \(mentoring to adapt training methods\), iii\) health system strengthening, and iv\) monitoring and evaluation \[5.4\-5.6\]. PACK Adult was implemented, through training and dissemination of materials, in 52 clinics in 3 Nigerian states from 2016 to 2018, with World Bank funding \[5.4\].  In 2018 PACK Adult was adapted for Ethiopia, and 100 master trainers from the Ethiopian Ministry of Health were trained; they are currently training frontline primary care workers in every primary care facility in all 9 regions of the country \[5.5\]. PACK Adult was first rolled out as a randomised controlled trial in the Brazilian city of Florianopolis in 2016, and in 2018 was extended to cover the whole city of 480,000 residents \[5.6, 5.7\]. Expansion of PACK Adult Brazil to all of Brazil is currently being negotiated, although disrupted by COVID\-19. 

 Using PACK Adult principles, PACK Child guidelines and materials were written, training was piloted and optimised in South Africa from 2017\-2019, and planning for province\- and nationwide implementation are under way. PACK Adolescent guidelines have been written, and piloting of training begins in 2021. Using this experience, Bachmann is also working with UK and East African researchers, and health ministries, on a randomised trial and upscaling of integrated primary care for HIV, diabetes and hypertension in Uganda and Tanzania, which began in 2020. Impact from this research is expected after 2020. 

 **4.3 Further expansion of antiretroviral treatment in South Africa** 

 Continuing the impact of the 2010 STRETCH trial of nurse initiation and monitoring of antiretroviral treatment \(ART\) \[2.3\], ART continues to expand in South African, reaching 5.2 million people by 2019, with over 1.9 million having started ART since 2014 \[5.8\]. 

 **4.4 Health impact** 

 The health impact of these programmes on African and Brazilian populations is likely to be huge. Independent research has shown that implementation of Primary Care 101 guidelines in South Africa would reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease and diabetes by 7.5 disability adjusted life years \(DALYs\) per 1000 population per year and would save USD24,902 per DALY gained \[5.3\]. 

 Almost everyone currently receiving ART in South Africa would eventually die of AIDS without it. Our cohort study \(Fairall LR, Bachmann MO, Louwagie G, et al, 2007\), completed before and justifying the STRETCH trial, used data from a province\-wide government HIV programme and rigorous causal modelling, to estimate that ART reduced the risk of death by 86%. This means that >4.4 million lives would be saved \(85% of 5.2 million\), including >1.6 million who started ART since 2014 \(85% of 1.9 million\). Tuberculosis incidence in South Africa decreased by about 177,000 cases per year from 2014 to 2019 \[5.9\], primarily due to ART expansion.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 ​For 20 years, academics at Manchester Metropolitan University Business School have conducted research into entrepreneurship, leading to the development of evidence\-based frameworks around the concepts of ‘strategic space’ and social capital in small and medium\-sized enterprises \(SMEs\). Since 2014, collaborative research has supported 891 small firms through funded projects worth over GBP26,000,000. The Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Programme has enabled 181 high\-growth small enterprises to unlock the economic and job creation potential of their businesses. Through a sustained programme of research around people management in SMEs, researchers have also created a substantial and important evidence base for policy\-makers and businesses. The research directly influenced The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development \(CIPD\)’s decision to create a national People Skills Advisory Hub, in partnership with the JP Morgan Chase Foundation, which has supported over 22,500 small businesses since 2019. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 SMEs are the lifeblood of the UK economy, comprising more than 99% of the nation’s business population and providing 60% of private employment.  In 2013, The Witty Review highlighted the crucial role that universities must play in engaging with their local SMEs, and “injecting technology, expertise, talent and knowhow into them” \(The Witty Review: 34\). At Manchester Metropolitan Business School, researchers in the Centre for Decent Work and Productivity \(DWP\) collaborate with the Centre for Enterprise \(CfE\), a specialist knowledge exchange centre, to develop partnerships with national policy organisations and regional SMEs. 

 **Working with SMEs – Developing Strategic Space and Social Capital** 

 Research undertaken by DWP demonstrated a lack of understanding in traditional SME support programmes of the importance of strategic space and social capital.  Between 2003 and 2006, Jones led the ESRC\-funded ‘Evolution of Business Knowledge’ \(EBK\) project, which focused on how businesses acquire knowledge. Jones researched the evolution of business knowledge in SMEs and developed the concept of ‘strategic space’ that enables owner\-managers: ""to focus on strategic renewal and change"" **\[1\]**. Strategic space recognises the need for owner\-managers to have the resources, motivation and capability to engage in critically\-reflexive processes to review and revise organisational practices in order to accomplish learning and transformation. Research developed from the New Entrepreneur Scholarship \(NES\) programme, which supported 900 new entrepreneurs from 2001 to 2008 \(G1\). Rouse’s analysis of the financial barriers faced by disadvantaged entrepreneurs added to the evidence base **\[2,3\]**. 

 Rouse’s research showed that the acquisition of social capital, specifically through large networks, bonding ties, trust, reciprocity, obligations and expectations, is crucially important for entrepreneurs. Recognising the importance of both social capital and the strategic space to “work on the business, not in the business”, DWP researchers have focused on developing innovative SME support programmes, reinforced by robust research. These initiatives explicitly develop capacity for strategic space and cross\-disciplinary peer network\-building, rather than more traditional business support approaches, which often fail to recognise the complexities around the way in which SMEs acquire knowledge. 

 **Working to improve SME people management practice** 

 DWP academics have a significant track record in people management research. This has focused on strengthening people management practice, including flexible working, equality, diversity and inclusion, and employment regulation **\[4,5,6\].** In 2017, in recognition of this research expertise, the CIPD \(the professional body and industry voice for HR and people development with over 150,000 members worldwide\) commissioned Atkinson and Lupton to undertake a research evaluation of its unique People Skills Pilot Programme \(funded by the JP Morgan Foundation\) **\[H\]**. The aim of the programme was to support more effective people management and leadership practices in SMEs to increase productivity. It, again, drew on the concept of strategic space, offering one\-to\-one consultancy to SME owner\-managers and the opportunity to design bespoke solutions for their people management challenges. In a national study, evidence was collected via surveys, focus groups and face\-to\-face/telephone interviews from 459 firms, including 21 in\-depth case studies. The findings demonstrate that there is significant demand for HR support by SMEs, and that developing the principles of people management through face\-to\-face provision by independent specialists is highly beneficial in making effective HR decisions. The provision of HR advice provided business owners with strategic space and the opportunity for strategic renewal and change, creating a foundation for boosting the quality of management practice and workplace productivity **.**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Working with SMEs to boost productivity and growth** 

 Manchester Metropolitan research has led to the design and delivery of innovative programmes of support for small firms, based on strategic space and social capital development. These partnerships with the business community have led to significant impacts on the economic development of the region particularly around innovation and job creation **\[A\]**. In all of the programmes, business owners are supported to understand how to develop and exploit their networks more effectively to create opportunities for innovation and to explore new markets and products. Research\-informed knowledge exchange programmes include: 

 **The Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Programme** 

 Between 2010 and 2015, Manchester Metropolitan was one of only four universities in the UK chosen to design and deliver the  [Goldman Sachs\-funded programme](https://www.goldmansachs.com/citizenship/10000-small-businesses/UK/) for High Growth Small Businesses. Engaging with the CEOs of 300 SMEs in the North West, the programme created new communities of entrepreneurs and peer learning opportunities over a six\-month intervention. Since 2014, 181 SMEs have received specialist support with 77% reporting an increase in the number of people they employed in the previous 12 months, and 66% confirming that their turnover had increased in comparison to the previous 12\-month period **\[A\].** 

 **European Regional Development Fund Programmes** 

 Since 2014, DWP research has underpinned eight growth and innovation\-focused ERDF projects with a total value of GBP26,741,728. Examples of these pioneering research\-led initiatives include: 

 **i. Growth\-Focused Programmes** 

 *The Cheshire and Warrington Business Growth Programme* is a North West consortium developed to deliver business growth activities across local priority sectors from 2016\-2021. This GBP3,385,000 ERDF\-funded programme utilises concepts of strategic space and social capital to bring entrepreneurs together to create new networks. Research\-based activities around peer learning and mentoring, coaching and masterclasses have directly supported 168 businesses to expand their networks, as well as 61 new start\-ups and the creation of 76 new jobs in the regional economy **\[B\]**. *The Greater Manchester High Growth Network* is a GBP750,000 programme, in partnership with the Greater Manchester Growth Hub, designed to support firms with high growth potential in Manchester. It has worked with over 200 SMEs to embed research\-led learning within their business strategies **\[B\].** The CEO of Black Milk confirms the impact of the Manchester Metropolitan programme on their business growth, which has enabled them to move into e\-commerce and expand their online products. In 2020, during lockdown, its e\-commerce sales quadrupled: *From taking time out from day to day operations and gaining valuable new insights, business tools and new networks, Black Milk have successfully opened cafes in multiple locations”*\(CEO, Black Milk\) **\[B\].** *The SMART Cheshire Innovation Programme* is a GBP1,700,000 project designed to support entrepreneurs and small businesses increase innovation across Cheshire. From 2016 \- 2020 it has supported 135 SMEs to develop their ideas and products through an innovation process, facilitated by strategic space and development of peer networks. This has resulted in the creation of 33 jobs and the launch of 92 new products **\[C\],** and in 2018, Hydraulics Online won the Federation for Small Businesses’ North West Business Exporter Award **\[C\]**. The CEO, Hydraulics Online, confirms the vital role *Smart Cheshire* played in developing peer networks to help drive her business forward: *SMART Cheshire not only gave me the confidence that I needed to take my business forward, it also put me in touch with the Women In Business Network. It was through this network that I won a scholarship to study an MBA at Manchester Metropolitan and this, combined with the continued support from the University, has been instrumental in the success of my business.* \(CEO, Hydraulics Online\) **\[C\].** 

###  ii. Interdisciplinary Innovation Programmes 

 In 2018, the GBP4,000,000 *Manchester Fuel Cell Innovation Centre* brought together industry and academic researchers and experts \(e.g. Greater Manchester Combined Authority, Transport for Greater Manchester, and Greater Manchester Hydrogen Partnership\) to support small firms to innovate and grow. Using the concept of strategic space and social capital development in a programme of support workshops and bespoke one\-to\-one sessions, Manchester Metropolitan research has helped 71 SMEs to create ten market\-disrupting products in the nascent fuel cell industry **\[D\].** In 2020, the Centre was ‘Runner Up’ in the Guardian Awards for Business Collaboration, which recognises excellence and innovation in the field of business\-university partnerships **\[D\].** Since 2018, this approach of combining research\-led growth expertise and scientific input has been pivotal to success in funding and leading several regional consortiums, delivering to over 320 SMEs in the region. These include the *Greater Manchester Cyber Foundry,* which engages with regional small firms to support research\-led innovation, and by December 2020, the project had recruited 95 SMEs \(39 through Manchester Metropolitan\) **\[E\]**. The SME founder of Digital Oracles, comments: *Before joining the Cyber Foundry, our business idea was really just a piece of paper…working with the Cyber Foundry has added value to our business; when they see who we have worked with they invite us to collaborate and give us business opportunities* **\[E\]**. Building on the success of the Cyber Foundry, the GBP6,000,000 *Greater Manchester AI Foundry* \(2020\) is currently focusing on business development with SMEs who have high potential for business growth through the application of AI. Additional interdisciplinary collaborations have utilised DWP’s research\-led growth development, together with scientific expertise. These include the ECO\-I NW project \(GBP14,000,000, 2020\), which is supporting low carbon business innovations from 369 SMEs across the North West, and the PrintCity Networks, focused on growing SMEs through business expertise and 3D printing capability. 

 **The Small Business Charter** 

 In recognition of its innovative approach to SME development, the Business School was one of only 20 in the UK to receive the CABS Small Business Charter Award in 2014 **\[F\]**. Re\-accredited in 2019, with exemplar status, this award led to the research programme ‘Leading to Grow’, funded by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. As a consortium of 15 SME\-specialist business schools across England, this research project was originally designed to understand how microbusinesses could increase productivity through the adoption of new technologies. At the beginning of the UK lockdown in March 2020, the programme pivoted to deliver vital support, using the concept of strategic space and entrepreneurial learning, to 25 Greater Manchester companies via an ‘Entrepreneur in Residence’. The CEO of Coolbox Ltd underlines the importance of ‘Leading to Grow’ during the Covid pandemic: *The Leading to Grow team have been a fantastic help during the COVID\-19 pandemic. Much of our work is related to the food, drink and hospitality sectors, so the lockdown had a very big impact on us as a business…It was a huge help to have an experienced and knowledgeable advisor involved with decision making during such a tough time for SMEs* **\[F\].** The Business School is also a key partner in the UK’s CABS *Small Business Leadership Programme,* which delivers research\-informed training to help SMEs develop their potential for growth and productivity. Acknowledging the impact of the School’s SME initiatives and enterprise support programmes, the Chief Executive of CABS states: *Manchester Metropolitan University Business School has demonstrated the hugely important contributions business schools can make locally to support small businesses and a city’s enterprise ecosystem* \(CEO, CABS UK\) **\[F\]**. 

 **Working with policy\-makers to improve SME productivity and growth** 

 Research undertaken by DWP has had a direct impact on organisations and policy\-makers that support SMEs. In 2017, Atkinson and Lupton’s research findings **\[G\]** led the CIPD to adopt effective people management support in SMEs for the first time as one of their key strategic priorities rolled out across CIPD’s nationwide activities. Building on Atkinson and Lupton’s evidence, the CIPD called on the Government to invest in HR business support as part of a renewed focus in the Industrial Strategy on enhancing workplace productivity **\[G\].** In November 2018, the CIPD used Atkinson and Lupton’s evidence to support a funding request to the Treasury in the Autumn Budget Submission for GBP39,000,000 to ‘revolutionise’ the quality of support to SMEs via a funding roll out of its People Skills programme **\[G\]**. Although not funded, Innovate UK and Business Basics funding was subsequently secured to support the roll\-out. Findings also supported the development of the  [CIPD People Skills Hub **,**](https://peopleskillshub.cipd.co.uk/) providing evidence\-based essential HR and people management advice to over 22,500 UK SMEs. As Head of Public Policy for the CIPD confirms: *Manchester Met findings provided the evidence for the CIPD to include effective people management support in SMEs as a key national strategic priority, which directly informed its lobbying to Government*. *In 2019, the research findings also informed the development of the CIPD’s People Skills Hub, a unique direct\-to\-SMEs service to support productivity and people management in small firms* **\[G\].** CIPD’s ‘Manifesto for Work 2020’ also cites Atkinson and Lupton’s evaluation evidence, thus confirming its impact on the wider workplace agenda **\[G\].** In 2019, the CIPD invited Atkinson and Lupton to undertake further research exploring the role of Local Enterprise Partnerships \(LEPs\) in driving the productivity and skills agenda in local economies. Their final report emphasised the importance of effective people management in combatting low productivity **\[H\].** In recognition of her wider expertise, Atkinson was invited by the Women and Equalities Committee to submit evidence on her research into employment in SMEs. Atkinson’s evidence is cited several times in the final report, including her argument that the business support landscape is complex, fragmented and difficult for time\-poor SMEs to navigate. The final report \(2018\) also highlights Atkinson’s recommendation of using local partners, e.g. city councils, LEPs, Growth Hubs and Chambers of Commerce to engage with SMEs to develop manager capability and expertise **\[I\].** In 2020, building on their previous research **\[1\-6\],** the DWP team were awarded GBP1,000,000 ESRC funding to establish the Good Employment Learning Lab \(GELL\). GELL adopts an engaged scholarship methodology approach to exploring good management practice in SMEs across Greater Manchester. It has already engaged with key partners \(CIPD, the Institute for Small Business & Entrepreneurship, the NHS, the Federation of Small Business, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority councils, the TUC and ACAS\) to co\-design effective management practice interventions. In recognition of her research excellence in SME management development, Atkinson was recently invited to sit on the Greater Manchester Good Employment Charter Board. 

 **Using SME research to lobby policy\-makers during COVID\-19** 

 In 2020, Rouse used her research into strategic space and entrepreneurial development to establish the Women’s Enterprise and Policy Group \(WEPG\) and develop a framework of policy actions to help women to form thriving and sustainable businesses **\[J\]**. In October 2020, Rouse shared key research findings with the IFM\-Bonn International Roundtable on SMEs and COVID 19, which subsequently fed into the European Union SME Assembly. The importance of her work has been highlighted across national \(The Telegraph and The Mirror\) and regional media, generating a significant response from struggling business owners seeking her expert advice **\[J\].**

topic we find research that supports and informs business, entrepreneurialism, management as well as research informing public and private investments often for regional growth and development as well as policies aimed at improving productivity and firm growth in various forms. Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research. Several projects are also concerned with sustainable practices in business and entrepreneurialism for a greener economy and with enabling more socially responsible corporate practices.",25.32,26.24,50.43,33.17,61.53,41.8,38,10,170,68,114,7,501,210,85,18,-0.0847222222222222,0.1785886172650878,0.0979797979797979,0.1292970049458599,0.1319408369408369,0.1230375523946952,551

 This research has transformed the assessment practice of Speech and Language Therapists \(SLTs\) working with people with aphasia \(communication difficulties post\-stroke\) nationally and internationally. The Comprehensive Aphasia Test \(CAT\), developed by Howard, has become the assessment of choice for clinical use in the UK, with subsequent adaptation into 24 languages; for some countries the adapted CAT is the first aphasia assessment in that language. Via an influential textbook, written by the wider research team, SLTs and student SLTs have been equipped with the knowledge to use and interpret the CAT, facilitating their work with people with aphasia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Aphasia is a communication disorder following stroke that can affect understanding and production of spoken and written language, with wide\-ranging impacts on everyday activities and peoples’ wellbeing. In the UK, 100,000 people have a stroke each year and a third of those who have had a stroke have aphasia \(Stroke Association, 2018\). Speech and Language Therapists \(SLTs\) working with people with aphasia use assessments to understand the nature of the person’s difficulties, consider the impact on everyday functioning and to plan appropriate intervention. Assessments need to be grounded in up\-to\-date theory and be accessible and time efficient to allow use in clinical practice. SLTs need to understand the theoretical rationale underpinning assessments in order to interpret results and use the findings to plan appropriate intervention. Within the management of aphasia, it is important to assess skills in the language\(s\) of use. For English speaking countries, there is a tradition of aphasia assessment, with a wide range of tests available. However, in some countries there are no, or a very restricted number of often poorly designed, assessments available. Comparable cross\-linguistic assessment would allow results across languages to be collated for clinical and research purposes. The research discussed here has provided SLTs with an innovative clinical assessment \(CAT\), facilitated access to the theoretical knowledge that enables them to use the test to determine diagnosis and plan treatment and considered the contribution of formal language assessment in a clinical setting. 

  

 The CAT **\(PUB 1\)** was developed by Howard, working in collaboration with Swinburn and Porter, who were working in the NHS at the time. The CAT was an innovation in aphasia assessment, uniquely combining language assessment based on a particular theoretical perspective \(the cognitive neuropsychological approach\), assessment of wider cognitive skills and consideration of the impact of aphasia on the person’s everyday life. Howard led on design of sub\-tests and subsequent analysis of the test’s psychometric properties. The advantages of the CAT are: \(i\) being comprehensive, as it assesses a wide range of language and cognitive impairments and the effect of the language impairment from the patient’s perspective; \(ii\) being clinically useful because it is brief; \(iii\) being able to monitor recovery and outcome; and \(iv\) being psychometrically well constructed. CAT reports crucial psychometric properties including inter\-tester reliability, test/re\-test reliability, construct validity, predictive and concurrent reliability \( **PUBS 2 & 3\)**. Well\-constructed assessments report this data, enabling the user to be confident about the interpretation and scope of the tool. 

 Whitworth, Webster and Howard identified the need to support SLTs to be able to access and apply research to clinical practice, producing the first edition of their bestselling textbook on aphasia in 2005. The second edition was published in 2014 **\(PUB 4\)** and was revised primarily to include reference to the CAT. The book provides an introduction to the cognitive neuropsychological approach, guiding clinicians through the choice of assessments and their interpretation and treatment options. Howard’s research was fundamental to the development of the cognitive neuropsychological model and this is reflected in the introductory chapters. Within the book, the authors provide expository summaries that synthesise findings and the issues to be considered. Whilst drawing together treatment studies across a range of researchers, the book includes a high proportion written by researchers based at Newcastle University \(Morris, Howard, Webster and Whitworth\), \(2 out of 8 studies on auditory comprehension, 9 out of 29 studies on noun retrieval, 2 out of 13 studies on verb retrieval\); these intervention studies were all originally published in peer reviewed journals. 

  

 As researchers, we need to consider the clinical use of aphasia assessments to understand the impact of current tests and to guide the development of future measures. In a recent International survey, Morris and Webster investigated the role of formal language assessments **\(PUB 5\)**. Clinicians reported using a combination of informal and formal assessment, with CAT playing a valuable role in diagnosis, goal setting, planning of treatment and evaluating outcome.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This research has transformed the assessment practice of SLTs in the UK and internationally. It has equipped SLTs and student SLTs \(the next generation of therapists\) with the knowledge they need to use a theoretically guided approach to assessment, promoting accurate diagnosis and the planning of effective treatment. 

 **Use of CAT by Speech and Language Therapists** CAT \(English language version\) is sold as a standalone product. Even though there is a restricted market for tests such as these and it is common practice for clinical departments to buy only one copy of a test for use across multiple clinicians/settings, CAT has sold 1,339 copies worldwide since August 2013 \(2,966 copies since publication\), with sales in the UK \(1,894\), the US \(439\), Australasia & Pacific \(327\), Ireland \(188\), Asia \(41\) and Europe \(40\) **\(IMP1\)**. The continued sales of the test and the scoresheets \(2,321 packs of 10 since August 2013\) emphasise that CAT is a cornerstone of clinical practice. The widespread use of CAT in the English\-speaking world **\(IMP2\)** made it a candidate for adaptation into other languages. 

 **Cross\-Linguistic Adaptation and Use of CAT** 

 CAT’s significance for clinical practice and value to practitioners is emphasised by its translation and/or adaptation to other languages. It has been adapted for and published in Arabic \(2013\), Dutch \(2014\) and Danish \(2017\) **\(IMP3\)**. In an interview where written responses were provided, authors of the Danish version state that they chose to adapt the CAT following a comprehensive review of tests available in Denmark, recognising the limited availability of standardised tests, the psychometric strengths of CAT and the inclusion of the cognitive screen and client self\-evaluation **\(IMP4\)**. It was recognised that ‘there were no Danish aphasia tests available that investigate aphasia from the point of view of cognitive neuropsychology’ **\(IMP4\)**. The results of on\-line surveys to clinicians working in Denmark \(64 respondents\) **\(IMP5\)** and Holland \(26 respondents\) **\(IMP6\)** show that the adaptations of CAT are being used extensively, with over 80% \(Danish\) and 92% \(Dutch\) respondents using the test in part or in full. Two thirds of respondents felt the CAT had benefited their work with people with aphasia. When asked to consider the benefits for the people with aphasia, respondents highlighted the planning of better/more targeted intervention, as well as allowing the patient to gain insight into their difficulties **\(IMP5, IMP6\)**. 

 Significantly, CAT is now being adapted into a range of other languages via the work of the  [Collaboration of Aphasia Trialists](http://www.aphasiatrials.org/), an Erasmus Collaborative Research Network. The Collaboration is an international network of multidisciplinary aphasia researchers which aims to enhance aphasia research knowledge, skills, methodologies and infrastructure. Scientific analysis of CAT **\(IMP2\)** showed that it met the criteria for a cross\-linguistic tool, making it the language test of choice for adaptation. These criteria included being comprehensive, relatively short, clinically relevant in informing further assessment and treatment approaches and user\-friendly **\(IMP2\)**. When established in 2014, the Assessment and Outcomes Working Group of the Aphasia Trialists focused on adaptation of the CAT into 12 languages \(Basque, Catalan, Croatian, Cypriot Greek, French, Greek, Hungarian, Norwegian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish\), of which some \(e.g. Croatian, Cypriot Greek\) have no assessment tools available and no diagnostic tradition for aphasia in place **\(IMP2\)**. Cross linguistic adaptations provide clinicians with robust means to assess people with aphasia, at times when no assessment existed before, including a summary of the person’s linguistic abilities and impairments and a means of monitoring recovery and measuring outcome **\(IMP2\)**. By January 2020, the project had expanded with an additional nine languages now included in the CAT adaptation project \(Finnish, German, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Irish, Italian, Russian, Slovenian, Moroccan Arabic, Punjabi\) **\(IMP7, Snapshot of website from 31 January 2020\)**. There is no other aphasia assessment that exists in this many languages, allowing comparison of results across languages for clinical and research purposes. The Assessment and Outcomes Working Group are now also adapting several assessments focusing on the psychosocial impact of aphasia; this work, now encompassing 26 languages, would not have progressed without the trailblazing work on the adaptation of CAT **\(IMP7, Snapshot of website from 26 September 2020\)**. 

 **Enhancing the Knowledge of Qualified and Student Speech and Language Therapists** 

 As with the clinical tests, there is a limited market for textbooks about aphasia. The first 2005 edition of *A Cognitive Neuropsychological Approach to Assessment and Intervention in Aphasia* sold 5,553 copies worldwide. The second edition published in 2014 has sold 2,476 copies \(2,145 paperback, 135 hardback and 208 electronic books\) with primary sales of hard copies in the UK \(1,216\), US \(293\), Australasia & Pacific \(367\), Ireland \(14\), Europe \(232\), Asia \(101\) and the Middle East \(45\) indicating significant reach \( **IMP1\)**. The second edition is ensuring the next generation of SLTs are familiar with CAT and have the theoretical understanding to use it. Lyndsey Nickels, an eminent aphasia researcher in Australia, described the book as ‘essential reading for students and an invaluable reference for clinicians’. The book has been translated into Japanese \(published 2015\) and Chinese \(published 2016\) **\(IMP8\)**. 

 Surveys in 2019 to the universities with pre\-registration SLT courses **\(IMP9\)** and to student SLTs **\(IMP10\)** in the UK \(14 universities\), Ireland \(4\) and Australia \(18\) highlighted the significance of the CAT and the book in student learning. A total of 19 universities and 151 students responded. 84% of the universities reported that students were explicitly taught about CAT **\(IMP9\)** and 90% of students were familiar with CAT. The Whitworth et al. \(2014\) book was a recommended text in 84% of the universities, making it the most popular aphasia textbook **\(IMP9\)**. 80% of students were familiar with the book, with 59% using it frequently to support their learning; this made it the most frequently used aphasia textbook in the three countries surveyed **\(IMP10\)**. 

 Students who were familiar with the book were given the opportunity to provide qualitative comments about how it had contributed to their learning. Students commented on the link between the book and their teaching on aphasia e.g. *‘main text book for relevant areas of the course \- required reading for every lecture’* and its value in supporting their learning e.g.  ‘ *brilliant resource to aid the assessment & intervention processes in relation to the cog neuro model \- I have found this text highly beneficial as a resource to support my understanding of lecture topics and content \(and to clarify some areas of uncertainty\), for exam revision, and across both aphasia placements as a 'quick guide' to make sure that I'm 'on the right track' in my approach to assessment and/or intervention.’.* One student commented *‘this book is like the bible\! it is so helpful when considering aphasia and is my go to book for looking at diagnosis and also therapy planning and management’.* **\(IMP10\)**. 

 This evidence has demonstrated the global impact of this research for speech and language therapists working with people with aphasia.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Fundamental research, led by Plymouth’s Professor Neil James, into process\-property\-performance relationships in friction welding and associated residual stress underpinned development of a highly portable solid\-state coring and repair process platform \(WeldCore\). The technique has been coupled with through\-thickness fracture toughness determination by small punch creep testing to provide a transformation in creep condition monitoring and repair/life extension decisions in power generation and chemical process plant in South Africa. 

  

 This step\-change derived from certification as a qualified welding process in Supplement 3 of the ASME  Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code in 2015.  Routine deployment in South Africa was then possible, initially by ESKOM and subsequently by SASOL, in creep condition monitoring and assessment.  Impacts include savings of millions of pounds in delayed procurement costs of power generation components by ESKOM, as well as increased power generation availability from lower unplanned outage figures.  WeldCore is in use on high temperature process plant operated by Sasol, a South African synthetic fuel and chemical manufacturing company that in 2018 employed 20,945 people, made capital investments in South Africa with a value of circa £1 Billion and provided circa 24% of the liquid fuel needs of South Africa from coal \(data from Sasol Integrated Report 2018, 5.10\).  Their business is therefore centred on chemical process plant and the WeldCore technology has enabled more accurate creep condition monitoring and remnant life assessment of important plant.

### 1.  Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Friction stir welding \(FSW\) is a solid\-state process with major advantages in cost and performance, compared with fusion welding.  Optimum welding parameters give low residual stresses and defects, with high fatigue strength, although process parameters are generally chosen empirically, which is sub\-optimum.    Detailed research understanding of process\-property\-performance relationships is required for development, deployment and certification of any new welding technique in industrial practice. 

  

 At Plymouth, process\-property\-performance relationships for welding, and for FSW techniques in particular, have been a primary research area for James since 1997.  In 1998 a long\-term and highly productive FSW collaboration was initiated with Hattingh at Nelson Mandela University \(NMU\) in South Africa \[3.1 – 3.6 & 5.8, 5.9 & 5.11\], and with industrial partners from the Dutch steel and aluminium firm Hoogovens, subsequently Corus R&D, Rotherham. In 2005, ESKOM, the South African power utility, became actively involved in the work on welding and associated neutron and synchrotron diffraction residual stress experiments led by James. 

  

 In collaboration with Hattingh, James’ research on interaction between performance and defects, residual stress and process optimisation \(Plymouth PhD projects with Lombard and Bradley\) \[3.1\-3.3\] enabled a transition from purely empirical selection of FS welding parameters.  The FSW and friction taper hydro\-pillar processing \(FTHPP\) research led to a thorough understanding of the influences of tool speed, feed rate and geometry on residual stresses, microstructure and defects, and hence on mechanical and fatigue properties.  A significant outcome \(jointly supervised PhD at NMU \- Blignault\) was a unique technique for assessing optimum process parameters via a graphical FSW interface, termed the force footprint diagram \[3.4\]. 

  

 In response to an existing industrial need, these research insights led Hattingh to develop an instrumented FSW platform measuring forces, torque and temperature. Further extensive research into the primary parameters influencing weld output properties as a function of tool geometry \(2005\-2008 – Blignault, Lombard\) demonstrated that maximum force on a tool during its rotation \(the force footprint apogee\) and its angular rotation during welding captured aspects of the plastic deformation in the stir zone which were fundamental to achieving high\-performance, defect\-free welds.  This research showed that fatigue performance and defect population in FS welds could be correlated with frictional power and heat input into the welds \(Lombard\).  For the first time, this allowed prediction of optimised regimes of tool feed and rotational speed in FS welding \(Bradley, Lombard\) \[3.2 & 3.3\]. 

  

 The complementary range of expertise in this 20\-year series of projects was fundamental to translation of research from university into industrially\-useful computer\-controlled platform development \[5.1, 5.2, 5.8, 5.9 & 5.11\] and the ASME code qualification case \[5.3a\] that is necessary for routine deployment in condition monitoring \[3.6\].

### 1.  Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins> **Fundamental research**</ins> 

 Plymouth \(James\) has led work into process\-property\-performance relationships in friction welding and its associated residual stress states.  This work provided the necessary research foundation \[5.9\] to support development of a condition monitoring process \(Weldcore\) suitable for integration into a highly portable, automated, friction taper hydro\-pillar processing platform and for the submission of an ASME code approval case in 2015.  This platform is currently used in thermal power generation \(ESKOM\) and chemical process \(SASOL\) plant for creep condition monitoring of thick\-walled high\-temperature pressure vessel components.  Accurate creep condition monitoring is given additional urgency by the fact that much of the electrical generating capacity and other high\-temperature plant is now operating well beyond its original design life.  Historically, it has been challenging to accurately assess in\-depth creep damage, the associated fracture toughness and remnant life in such components, which are critical to meeting the energy, and chemical \(e.g. fertiliser\) requirements of the modern world. 

  

 <ins> **WeldCore</ins> <ins>development**</ins> 

 The fundamental research directed by James underpinned and supported the design, development and manufacture at NMU of automated friction processing platforms for industry \[5.9\].  The automated platform cores out an 8 mm diameter sample of the alloy steel, for example on thick\-walled steam pipe with diameters of 600 mm to 1050 mm, to a depth of 23 mm and immediately repairs the cored hole by solid\-state friction taper hydro\-pillar processing \(FTHPP\).  The process is trademarked in South Africa as WeldCore and the eNtsa group at Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth \(led by Hattingh\) designs and builds the WeldCore platforms used in the creep sampling \[5.1, 5.2 & 5.8\].  The impact case study submitted in REF 2014 described this development to the prototype stage.  The present case study outlines the additional impact since 2014 that has primarily derived from the successful submission of code case approval documentation to ASME for use of the WeldCore technology on high temperature, high pressure plant.  The research input provided by Plymouth encompassed the linkages that exist between welding process, microstructure, and residual stress state that control the service performance. 

  

 This technology does not require taking the plant out of service nor excising a section of pipe for through\-thickness creep damage assessment, which had been the established technique in high\-temperature components.  The WeldCore process also avoids the necessity for repair by fusion welding, where residual stresses and defects are less controlled than in FTHPP. 

 <ins> **ndustrial</ins> <ins>use and impact**</ins> 

 In the South African situation, where the ESKOM power utility \(the largest in Africa\) generates 44.17 GW with 36.5 GW provided by steam and 1.86 GW being nuclear, aging plant contributes to high levels of unplanned generation losses and consequent electrical load shedding on a rotating basis around the country.  Accurate creep condition monitoring is an essential input into both unplanned and planned maintenance, and the WeldCore process supports improvements in planned creep condition monitoring and assists in reducing the number of unplanned power outages for ageing plant.  However, to move from a prototype platform \(which was the situation in 2014 to routine industrial deployment as an improved condition monitoring tool, requires qualification of the technique as safe to use in the boiler and pressure vessel industry.  This needs certification by an international standards authority. 

  

 A code case was therefore submitted in 2015 to the American Society for Mechanical Engineers for approval in their International Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.  As was the case for development of the friction hydropillar welding process used in the WeldCore platform, ESKOM was the industrial pull for this, and Plymouth/NMU collaborated on the fundamental process\-property\-residual stress state research \(e.g. synchrotron and neutron diffraction residual stress experiments at the ESRF and ILL with James as the PI\).  This code case was approved in Supplement 3 Section IX, published in September 2015 \(p. xix\) \[5.3a & b\]. 

  

 Subsequent to the ASME approval, impact has been greatly enhanced through routine application of the technologies in condition monitoring of chemical process plant at SASOL \[5.10\] as well as expanded use in power generation plant. The transformation in creep condition monitoring described in this case study encompasses automated creep sample extraction by coring, combined with immediate in\-situ hole repair, and the subsequent generation of explicit fracture toughness values for creep damaged material at all depths into the alloy, via small punch creep tests on the cored steel.   The long\-term outcome is more accurate estimation of remnant life for thick\-walled, high\-temperature industrial components and plant. 

  

 <ins> **South African recognition of innovation and impact**</ins> 

 The success and impact of the achievements described in this case study has been widely recognised in South Africa and derives from a combination of research excellence, innovative platform development and a strong industrial pull.  For instance, the collaboration between Plymouth and NMU was chosen as an exemplar of good practices in innovation collaboration between South Africa and Europe \[5.8\] in the 2015 case studies report produced by the European South African Science and Technology Advancement Programme \(ESASTAP\).  ESASTAP is a collaborative initiative between South Africa and the European Union whose main objective is to strengthen ties within the field of science, technology and innovation and which aims to foster innovation partnerships. 

  

 In this context, Hattingh has also received the Gold Medal of the South African Institute of Welding in 2012 for the WeldCore process development \[5.6\], was a finalist in the 2019/2020 National Science and Technology Forum \(NSTF\) innovation awards in recognition of an outstanding contribution to science, engineering, technology and innovation, and was recipient of the 2020 Honorary Medal of the Faculty of Natural Science and Technology of the South African Academy for Science and Art. 

  

 <ins> **Commercialisation and extension**</ins> 

 The WeldCore process has been commercialised via eNtsa, a South African government research, innovation and engagement hub initiative, whose expertise in FSW technologies is internationally recognised. eNtsa is based at NMU and directed by Hattingh The eNtsa team responsible for WeldCore has grown since 2014 by 12 employees and delivered a total of 15 projects with the technology providing an income of over £1m to eNtsa \[5.1 & 5.4 & 5.5\], which up to end\-2019 had an annual turnover of around the equivalent of £2.5 million, from its complete range of industrial support activities.  This growth would not have been possible without the expertise gained from FTHPP research and the associated WeldCore development. 

  

 ESKOM has a high current level of unplanned losses of generation capacity and a history of under\-investment in maintenance that in 2019\-2020 had a very significant impact on South Africa, with rolling domestic power outages commonplace to preserve generating capacity for industrial use \[5.2\].  The October 2020 ESKOM System Status and Outlook Briefing by the Chief Operations Officer \[5.2\] stated that “the majority of the coal power stations are operating past the midway of their operational life, resulting in high amounts of breakdowns” and that “the drive to implement the reliability maintenance and refurbishment projects in order to address the unreliability is under way.  Part of this drive represents the work done under contract by the eNtsa group which continued on power generation plant during the Covid lockdown in South Africa. 

  

 Since 2014, experience gained with ESKOM has enabled the group to extend its work into planned annual condition monitoring of chemical process plant at SASOL \[5.11\] and to develop a substantial small punch creep testing facility along with associated automated scoop specimen sampling for near\-surface creep assessment \[5.11\].  Small punch data from both the surface and through\-thickness cored specimen can be combined with microstructural assessment of creep\-induced damage \(voids\) and linked with finite element analysis to allow the derivation of direct fracture toughness values from the small punch test data.  The improved condition monitoring support process therefore encompasses creep sample extraction by coring, combined with automated in\-situ hole repair, and obtaining explicit fracture toughness values from small punch creep testing.  The outcome is better estimation of remnant life for thick\-walled, high temperature industrial components and plant. 

  

 Improved plant condition monitoring assists SASOL in keeping its South African synthetic fuel and chemical process plant fully operational and reduces unplanned expenditure on repair and replacement.  Much of the plant is aging, and was installed in the absence of detailed fracture mechanics design, which means that accurate assessment of current condition is critical to continued operation, remnant life assessment and replacement planning.  Effective control of repair and replacement expenditure benefits South African society, because SASOL impacts on the lives of many South Africans in a variety of ways \[e.g 5.8\], including direct employment \(20,985 people in South Africa\), an investment of the equivalent £56M in skills development in South Africa in 2018, a powerful social investment approach, and its embracing of transformation through broad\-based black empowerment and the SASOL Foundation.  In addition, as its industrial plants supply South Africa with fuels and oils, chemicals and gas, any unplanned plant downtime affects its income and the South African economy. 

  

 The importance of this technological development to the power generation and chemicals industries operated by SASOL \[5.10\] in South Africa arises from the approval by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers \(ASME\) in September 2015 of a Code Case for the use of the FTHPP for the coring and integrated repair of holes on high temperature and high\-pressure plant \[5.3\].  Certification approval was granted for the technique in Supplement 3 of the 2015 International ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section IX p.xix Case 2832 \[5.3\].  ASME code approval means that the process can be routinely used in condition monitoring, in South Africa and further afield, potentially enabling savings in the billions of Rand \[5.4\].  Interest in the technology and WeldCore platform has also come from further afield, in the form of visits by personnel from the Electric Power Research Institute in the United States of America and VTT in Finland, along with invitations to give keynote and plenary lectures at international conferences. 

  

 <ins> **Summary**</ins> 

 The impact described in this case study is being felt across South Africa through ESKOM, in terms of increased  availability of ageing generating capacity and a reduction in unplanned outages, and from the cost benefit contribution  to SASOL achieved from more accurate condition monitoring and creep assessment.  The skills and training provided through collaboration with Plymouth, and the joint research performed with Hattingh since 1999, and with Newby \(ESKOM\) since 2005, have enabled a very significant expansion in condition monitoring capability and its impact since 2014 \[5.2\- 5.7\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Marjon researchers developed the ‘Transformative Evaluation’ methodology for use in youth work contexts. Application of this tool has enabled a wide range of youth and community work organisations internationally to demonstrate the impact their work has on the lives of young people and across their wider community, thus filling an identified gap. Impact is threefold: enabling youth workers to better evaluate their practice, leading to improved practice through reflection, increased understanding and deepened relationships with young people; enabling organisations to better identify and share the outcomes of their work; and facilitating changes in evaluation processes within both organisational and national policy.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The premise of this research is a belief among academics that existing evaluation regimes are inadequate as they focus on quantitative data and prescribed outcomes \(Ellis and Gregory, 2008; Issitt and Spence 2005\). This results in youth workers being unable to identify qualitative outcomes, as well as being de\-skilled in evaluation \( **3.1, 3.2**\). The initial underpinning research was conducted by Dr Susan Cooper, Associate Professor of Education, developing, testing and reviewing the viability of an innovative evaluation methodology between 2009 and 2017 \( **3.2, 3.3**\). This involved an action research process and produced a rigorous means of generating qualitative data. The fieldwork took place in a medium\-sized voluntary sector youth work organisation in Cornwall, England. A qualitative study of the youth workers’ perceptions and experience of conducting evaluations identified that youth workers felt alienated by the dominant quasi\-experimental quantitative evaluation approaches in use at that time and supported the need for an alternative approach \( **3.1, ch. 3**\). Therefore, the **novel Transformative Evaluation \(TE\) methodology** was developed and piloted in the organisation \( **3.1, ch. 6**\), and a further qualitative study highlighted the benefits of this participatory methodology for practice, practitioners and organisations \( **3.1, ch. 7**\). 

 The methodology synthesises aspects of transformative learning, appreciative inquiry, the most significant change technique and practitioner evaluation. Its participatory nature engages young people, youth workers and external stakeholders in the generation of narratives of change. **The key findings of this initial research indicate that TE improves understanding of the demands of evaluating practice for both youth workers \(3.2\) and their wider organisations \(3.3\), promotes youth workers’ active re\-engagement with evaluation, and enables practitioners to identify and communicate the impact of youth work to a range of stakeholders \(3.1\).** 

 Funded by an Erasmus grant, the second stage of underpinning research, led by Dr Jon Ord, Associate Professor of Education, involved testing the applicability of the TE methodology among larger groups of professionals and more diverse youth work organisations between 2015 and 2017, in five European countries \(England, Finland, Estonia, Italy, France\) \( **3.A**\). The Erasmus research project generated 715 stories from individual young people in three open\-access youth centres in each of the five countries to identify the impact of youth work \( **3.5**\). The data was coded separately in each of the five country contexts and then over\-arching themes were produced through further thematic analysis – the themes were Sense of self, Creating places and spaces for young people, Relating to others, Experiential learning, Social inclusion *.* 

 **The outcomes of this underpinning research were two\-fold – firstly, that youth work organisations were able to better identify the outcomes of their work \(3.1; 3.3; 3.4; 3.5; 3.6\), and secondly, that youth workers re\-engaged in the process of evaluation believing that the methodology provided a useful means of assessing and improving their practice \(3.1; 3.2; 3.4; 3.5; 3.6\).**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Background:** 

 The case study is set within the context of the challenges across Europe in evaluating youth work practice \( [EC, 2014](https://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/youth/library/study/youth-work-report_en.pdf);  [EC, 2015](https://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/youth/library/reports/quality-youth-work_en.pdf)\), which emphasises the importance and benefits of identifying impact. Similarly, in 2011 the UK government challenged the sector to produce ‘robust but sophisticated outcome measures … on young people's personal and social development’. Despite the production of the government\-funded Outcomes Framework \( [2012](https://youngfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Framework-of-outcomes-for-young-people-July-2012.pdf)\), methodologies identifying impact remain limited. 

 Our **innovative evaluation methodology – Transformative Evaluation** – was developed to respond to these challenges, despite a UK youth policy vacuum. **It is significant because it provides youth work organisations with a tool to demonstrate the impact of their work** and was initially implemented within North Devon Homes, southwest England. 

 Bolstered by favourable results and facilitated by Erasmus\+ funding \( **3.A**\), and later, with the initial research serving as foundation for further rigorous, peer\-reviewed research projects which carried out TE in Scotland \( **5.1**\) and Western Australia \( **5.2**\), the methodology has been implemented successfully across the youth work sector. For example, the Deputy Director of the Estonian Youth Work Centre commented of TE, ‘ **as an assessment tool, it filled a gap across Europe**’ \( **5.3**\). 

 **1\) Individual level** 

 Between 2016 and 2020, **young people, as beneficiaries, in a variety of national and international youth work settings reported ‘feeling heard and listened to’ during the TE process** \( **5.4; also 5.5**\), thus having their voice amplified \( **5.2, p.2; 5.6, p.34**\). **This impact is significant, because it helped increase their trust, leading to improved relationships with youth workers and greater engagement in programmes**. For example, Helsinki charity Youth Guarantee House’s Manager reported that young people in Finland said TE made them feel valued for themselves rather than their accomplishments when youth workers listened to them and changed their practice to focus on relationships instead of tangible outcomes \( **5.5**\). 

 **The methodology also empowers young people.** One example involves a young person at Space\*, a social enterprise in Devon, who verbalised how he gained a greater awareness of himself and his responsibilities through TE discussions, and **he can thus ‘take better life opportunities’** \( **5.7**\). Others, in Scotland, ‘ **spoke about their recognition of the youth worker as a trusted adult…for advice and support**’ \( **5.1, p. 24**\). Evidence from a report published in 2019 by NHS Health Scotland indicates that ‘young people consistently view the trusted adult role as positive and indicate that it can help achieve outcomes such as higher educational attainment, optimism, self\-efficacy and reduced internalising symptoms’ \( **5.8, p.2**\). By enabling youth workers to recognise the importance of their role as a trusted adult and improve their practice \(noted below\), **TE supports better outcomes for young people in adult life**. 

 TE has numerous positive impacts on **youth workers as beneficiaries**. Youth workers corroborated the underpinning research findings of feeling alienated from existing methods of evaluation \(section 2\). In Estonia, **they reported being reinvigorated by TE**, finding it more complementary to their working practices, of greater relevance and producing better evidence of impact \( **5.3**\). Further, the Director of the UK charity Barefoot maintains the methodology **‘engendered a realisation among practitioners of the extent and importance of their work’**, especially of the ‘far\-reaching impacts on \[young people’s\] lives’ \( **5.4\); it also provides them with a tool to more easily demonstrate to others the impact of their work** \( **5.3**\), a task that they often find difficult. 

 In addition, youth workers in Finland, England, Estonia, Australia and Scotland reported that, since 2014, **the cyclical nature of TE has helped them improve their practice**, including through opportunities for reflection. In Australia, one stated, ‘\[It\] helped to more actively identify changes in a young person and provide that feedback for them….I was able to identify the things that I do well and perhaps other aspects of my work that I could improve on’ \( **5.6, p.39**\). Other impacts included: being better able to perceive and respond to young people’s preferences and needs \( **5.2, p.8; 5.4; 5.5**\); increased understanding of the significance of and need to develop trusting relationships \( **5.5; 5.2, pp.1\-2,7\-10; 5.1, p.26**\) and of the importance of providing an inclusive, non\-judgmental, safe space for young people \( **5.1, pp.24,26,28; 5.2, pp.7\-9,12\-13; 5,3; 5.5; 5.6, p.39; 5.7**\), which in turn reinforced these practices. **TE thus resulted in youth workers’ ability to better contextualise young people’s stories to inform future work and development of programmes, activities and policies affecting them \(5.4; 5.9\).** 

 **2\) Organisational level** 

 **At organisational level, TE leads to more robust evidence of impact \(5.3\). This results in better understanding of best practice at managerial level, further leading to improvements in procedures.** The Manager at Youth Guarantee House commented that the information arising from TE led directly to a policy shift in 2019 where developing relationships was prioritised \( **5.5**\). The Director of Barefoot asserted TE revealed the importance and effectiveness of relationship\-building and outdoor activities; thus, specific funding was recently sought and acquired \(from The Health Trust\) for trips out combining these two elements of youth work \( **5.4**\). **Such impact benefits the organisations, practitioners and young people**. 

 Because TE evidence is reliable and accessible, **organisations can better communicate the outcomes and value of youth work to stakeholders**, for example, local councillors, health board officers, politicians, parents and headteachers, **and to the wider community** \( **5.1, pp.5\-6; 5.3; 5.4; 5.6, pp.41\-43**\), all of whom benefit. Organisations in Western Australia report that the methodology made a significant contribution to stakeholders gaining a better understanding of youth work, appreciating the knowledge, skills and complexity of judgement required by youth workers \( **5.6, pp.41\-43**\). Various Scottish organisations stressed that TE ‘\[provided\] much\-needed evidence to support the youth work sector to sustain and further develop their service’ \( **5.1, Executive Summary**\). In England, the Director of Barefoot maintains ‘ **TE served to change people’s perspectives about youth work, affirming the organisation, especially \[outside\] the sector**’, with plans for local residents to become involved in the process \( **5.3**\), **indicating that TE’s positive impact extends into society more generally**. 

 Moreover, **TE strengthens staff learning, facilitates sharing practice, and builds teamwork.** In England, TE has been used as a staff learning tool, because it ‘fostered in youth workers the ability to become better attuned to noticing what young people want, hearing them when they say it, and adjusting their practice accordingly’ \( **5.4**\). In Estonia \( **5.3**\) and Australia, TE ‘created opportunities for reflection and peer discussion around practice’ \( **5.6, p.39**\). 

 **3\) Policy level** 

 **Transformative Evaluation has been adopted at regional and national policy levels**. Most significantly, **the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research implemented the methodology as a key qualitative evaluation tool for the assessment of youth work**. The Estonian Youth Work Centre, under the Ministry’s authority, embedded TE into its current Annual Activity Plan 2020 \( **5.10**\) and provided financial support in 2019 for the Estonian Association of Youth Workers to roll out the methodology in 10 municipalities. In 2019\-20, youth workers were trained in the methodology and it was disseminated throughout Estonia \( **5.3**\). 

 **The methodology has also been integrated into youth work organisations’ policy and extended to other organisations, thus enhancing assessment and practice.** Perth Inner City Youth Service \(PICYS\) in Australia and Space\* in Devon have embedded TE into their service model \( **5.2, p.15; 5.9**\). In 2019, Youth Guarantee House integrated its use into its normal annual procedures and extended it across Finland \( **5.5**\). In Plymouth, Barefoot recently acquired expansion funding, and TE is being built into the new structure of the organisation \( **5.4**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The MEDMIG project has generated new insights into the dynamics of migration and experiences of migrants that challenge dominant political and media narratives and support the efforts of the UN, NGOs and the private sector to change policy and practice in the UK, Europe and beyond. Specifically, the findings from the research have **\(a\)** increased representation of migrant experiences and perspectives through extensive engagement with policy makers in the UK, Europe and internationally; **\(b\)** increased public awareness of migrant experiences, voices and perspectives through extensive media engagement; **\(c\)** supported the work of the UN and private sector in bringing about narrative change; and **\(d\)** increased understanding of migration among teachers and young people through the design and delivery of curriculum in schools in the UK and online teacher training. The influence of the MEDMIG research findings can be directly observed through the funding, underpinning objectives and impact pathways of the £20million GCRF MIDEQ Hub \(2019\-2024\) led by Professor Crawley.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research was undertaken by Professor Heaven Crawley, Dr Katharine Jones and Dr Simon McMahon at Coventry University and colleagues from the Universities of Oxford and Birmingham in 2015 and 2016. In 2015, the ESRC and the Department for International Development co\-funded the Mediterranean Migration Research Programme in response to the increase in refugees and other migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe. This was largely represented by European politicians, policymakers and the media as a ‘crisis’. In direct response to this, MEDMIG was one of eight projects selected to conduct research with migrant and refugee populations who entered Europe across the Mediterranean. The main purpose of the project was to develop new evidence on the dynamics of migration and ensure that migrant voices and perspectives were better understood and able to inform the development of appropriate policy responses by governments, international organisations and other actors. The MEDMIG project provided the first large\-scale, systematic and comparative study of the backgrounds, experiences, aspirations and routes of migrants in four European countries \(Italy, Greece, Malta and Turkey\). The team conducted over 500 interviews with refugees and other migrants that had recently arrived from more than 30 countries and more than 100 interviews with stakeholders. In centring the voices and perspectives of refugees and other migrants, the research challenged underlying assumptions about the drivers of migration, the nature of migrant decision\-making and people’s journeys to Europe \[R1, R2, R3, R4\]. The research also drew attention to the ways in which knowledge and understanding of migration processes \(typically produced in disciplinary silos within institutions in the Global North\), reflect, feed into and reinforce dominant political, policy and media narratives. This was evidenced by supplementary analysis of 648 migration\-related stories in UK tabloid and broadsheet newspapers, and undertaken in partnership with Migrant Voice and funded by the Open Society Foundation’s Open Europe Initiative \[R6\] in 2016. Taken together, these projects have produced significant research findings that can be summarised in seven core conclusions and recommendations: 

1.  The representation of the movement of refugees and other migrants as linear, singular uninterrupted journeys or flows of people heading toward Europe is grossly misleading. These simplifications distract from what were often multiple separate movements which converged in Libya and Turkey – the places to which people initially travelled were often destination rather than ‘transit countries’. Understanding those movements was critical in explaining the arrival of refugees and migrants in Italy and Greece during 2015 \[R1, R2, R4\] 

1.  The production of knowledge on migration is frequently produced in the Global North, driven by the political and policy interests of Europe and ignoring or marginalising the experiences of refugees and migrants prior to their decision to cross the Mediterranean \[R1, R2, R3, R4\] 

1.  There is often a complex and overlapping relationship between ‘forced’ and ‘economic’ drivers of migration to Europe. Many of those who left their home countries primarily for economic reasons effectively became refugees during their journeys and were forced to continue moving even when they had not originally intended to travel to Europe \[R2, R3, R4\] 

1.  Border controls create irregularity. Not all participants crossed all borders irregularly \(without authorisation and/or the necessary documentation\), all of the time. There were significant differences between groups depending on their nationalities, access to documents and other resources \[R3, R4, R5\]. 

1.  Death and violence were a feature of migrant journeys and were exacerbated by immigration controls. 76% of respondents interviewed in Italy and Malta said that they had directly experienced physical violence. 29% stated that they had witnessed the death of a fellow traveller \[R1, R5\]. 

1.  All participants engaged smugglers for at least one leg of their journey to mitigate risks of violence and death from state actors, bandits and dangerous terrain. Smugglers are a symptom, not a cause, of unequal access to legal migration \[R1, R4, R5\]. 

1.  The voices and perspectives of migrants are rarely included in newspaper articles on migration that frequently rely upon ‘victim’ and ‘villain’ stereotypes \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Migration\-related policy making is often driven by political priorities, supported by ill\-informed assumptions about the motivations and aspirations of those who move, and ignoring, marginalising or misrepresenting the voices and perspectives of refugees and migrants themselves. Through the research team’s migrant\-centred approach and extensive engagement with the UN, parliamentarians, policy advisors, NGOs, media and the private sector, the MEDMIG research has contributed to significant shifts in public, political and media understanding of migration and supported UN, NGs and the private sector efforts to create narrative change and influence policy. The main impacts include: 

###  **Increased understanding and representation of migrant experiences and perspectives through extensive engagement with policy makers in the UK, Europe and internationally** 

 At the **UK level**, Crawley’s MEDMIG\-based evidence in 2016 to the House of Lords, EU Committee’s Inquiry on ‘Unaccompanied Migrant Children in the EU’ \[R1\], was cited numerous times throughout the Committee’s final report \[S1\].The MEDMIG findings were also cited extensively in the Independent Commission for Aid Impact’s \(ICAI\) 2017 review of the UK government’s aid response to irregular migration in the central Mediterranean \[S2\].  At the **European level**, the research team worked closely with the European Commission’s \(EC\) Joint Research Centre \(JRC\) on a series of policy briefings, seminars and launch of the MEDMIG findings in Brussels \[R1\]. As a consequence of this engagement, MEDMIG is referenced in the EC 2018 report *European migration: dynamics, drivers, and the role of politics* and informed the EU’s Pact on Migration and Asylum adopted in 2020 \[S3\]. Additional impact has been realised through the results of MEDMIG being embedded within Friends of Europe initiatives that engaged more than 300 stakeholders within its network of policymakers in Brussels and facilitating direct contribution of refugees and migrants to policymaking processes \[S4\]. At the **International level,** the MEDMIG findings were presented at a side\-event at the 2016 UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants in New York in partnership with the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \(OHCHR\) \[S5\]. Crawley also served as an expert adviser at UNHCR’s thematic discussions in Geneva in 2017 and organised and delivered an expert roundtable on *‘Ensuring a rights\-based approach to refugee protection and assistance’* in November 2017, the report of which was published by UNHCR on their website. The report was presented at the UN High Commissioner’s Global Dialogue event in December 2017, further extending the reach and significance of the MEDMIG research findings. 

###  **Raised public awareness of migrant experiences, voices and perspectives through extensive media engagement** 

 The research team have used the findings of MEDMIG \[R1, R2, R5\] to significantly enhance public awareness and understanding of migrant voices and perspectives through the media. In a special issue of the Escapism magazine, the UK’s biggest independent travel magazine with an average global readership of 250,000 and a UK readership of 88,000, MEDMIG data was used to raise awareness of the extent, challenges, and misconceptions of migration in the Mediterranean \[S6\]. An exclusive report in The Independent \[S7\] reporting on the findings of the MEDMIG project also enhanced awareness of the dynamics of migration in the Mediterranean, as did further articles and op\-eds in The Guardian, der Spiegel, Foreign Affairs, Times Higher, Open Democracy, Thomson Reuters Foundation, BBC and New York Times. These articles brought the voices of migrants and refugees to the public in an evidence\-based manner, challenging the popular media portrayal of migrants as ‘victims’ or ‘villains’.  As a result of this work, Crawley and McMahon secured additional funding from the Open Society Foundation’s Open Initiative for Europe to undertake research with Migrant Voice on the representation of migrants in the British media during the 2016 UK General Election. This report \[R6\] was launched at the Palace of Westminster in February 2017, attracting an audience of politicians, NGOs and the public. The MEDMIG team also presented the findings at numerous events organised, for example, by ODI and The Frontline Club, providing the public with evidence that did not exist previously. Public engagement with this new evidence led to the MEDMIG project being runner\-up in The Guardian Research Impact Awards in 2017 \[S8\]. 

###  **Supported the work of the UN and the private sector in bringing about narrative change** 

 The MEDMIG team has worked closely with the OHCHR, using the MEDMIG findings \[R1, R3\] to support UN efforts to secure narrative change. Crawley has contributed to the development of various tools and messaging materials including the ongoing global campaign \#StandUp4Migrants \[S5\]. This work is now being developed further through the GCRF MIDEQ Hub: OHCHR is a project partner and ‘narrative change’ is one of the project’s core impact pathways. The team’s efforts to secure narrative change have also engaged the private sector. As a result of the MEDMIG research project, Crawley, Jones and McMahon were commissioned by Ben and Jerry’s to write *‘Beyond Fear and Hate: Mobilising People Power to Create a New Narrative on Migration and Diversity’* which presents evidence and strategies for challenging negative public narratives towards migration and migrants and underpins Ben and Jerry’s efforts to change the debate on migration and diversity \[S9\]. According to the Head of Ben and Jerry’s Social Mission Strategy, this research was ‘ *the foundation for us to explore external work under our ‘One Sweet World platform’* which resulted in 4 million views across YouTube and Facebook and a PR reach of 56 million. Furthermore, on the back of this research *, ‘we launched our 3 year strategy which was a complete focus for our work across Europe on supporting refugee and asylum rights’*. An additional impact of this work was the development by Ben and Jerry’s of a public position around refugee and asylum rights that was launched at the Global Refugee Forum in 2019 \[S9\]. 

###  **Increased understanding of migration among teachers and young people through the design and delivery of curriculum in schools in the UK and online teacher training** 

 The MEDMIG project data \[R1\] underpins the award\-winning Maths of Migration \(MOM\) platform, a teacher\-led collaboration between PositiveNegatives and Oaklands School which increases understanding of migration and the experiences of refugees and other migrants through curriculum development. MOM has used the MEDMIG database in open\-access lesson plans for cross\-curricular secondary school teaching which, to date, has been implemented in multiple UK secondary schools and downloaded nearly 8,000 times. The learning from the MOM teacher training course has been extended across other subject areas and geographically in the form of a MOOC entitled ‘Teaching migration through data and storytelling’ delivered via Future Learn. The first course ran from October to November 2020 under the auspices of the GCRF MIDEQ Hub, attracting 632 learners from 31 countries \[S10\]. A further demonstration of how MEDMIG has impacted education and increased understanding of migration among teachers and young people is evidenced through the Royal Geographical Society \(with IBG\) that uses MEDMIG in online GCSE and A\-level educational resources, the importance of which was cited by John Howell MP \[S11\] in a UK Parliamentary debate on the teaching of migration history in schools. Indeed, the Head of Research and Higher Education at the RGS \(with IBG\) further details the impact of MEDMIG by concluding that the project *‘has fundamentally impacted our Education team in terms of how we deliver events for teachers on data skills and opportunities to work across the curriculum’* and the *‘research has enhanced understanding of migration in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and helped a significant cohort of teachers and students fundamentally reframe their understanding of a complex issue’* \[S12\] *.*

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research on cryogenic separation for the removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from a gas mixture has involved experimental research and modelling work. This research has led to the establishment of the start\-up company PMW Technology Ltd. by Paul Wilson, former Head of Innovation at consultants WSP. The research underpinned the development of the patented A3C \(advanced cryogenic carbon capture\) process. This process mitigates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from industrial sources that are harder to decarbonise through conventional technologies. The impact of this process is reduction of carbon emissions, helping to meet national and international commitments to tackling climate change, in line with the Government's Clean Growth Strategy. This work has created a full\-time job and the innovation has attracted industrial collaborators, such as Thyson Technology and Houlder Ltd, demonstrating the commercial potential of this cryogenic technology. Thyson Technology is a process engineering company specialising in complex analyser systems for oil and gas, with a global reach. Houlder Ltd is a marine design and clean technology company focussed on maritime decarbonisation.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research involves a novel cryogenic carbon capture process patented by the start\-up company PMW Technology Ltd. The established technology for carbon capture is chemical absorption using amine\-based solvents, but the large volumes of solvent used require significant thermal energy for regeneration. Cryogenic carbon capture through freezing out the CO<sub>2</sub> in industrial emissions is a physical separation that avoids dealing with hazardous chemicals, achieves high CO<sub>2</sub> removal levels and delivers a high purity CO<sub>2</sub>, which could be further used in the food industry and/or to produce chemicals. Since cryogenic separation often involves multiple beds and heavy frost deposition, at temperatures below \-100ºC, the advanced cryogenic carbon capture \(A3C\) technology, which we are working on, overcomes some limitations of previous cryogenic systems by using a moving bed of metallic beads as a heat transfer medium and frost capture surface. 

 The University of Chester has contributed to this research through the expertise in process simulation of Dr Carolina Font Palma and Dr Georgios Lychnos, and with the construction and demonstration of the cryogenic process by the PhD student David Cann. One final year MEng project student and 5 BEng project students have also contributed to the project, exemplifying the University of Chester approach to engaging students with research at all levels. 

 Our earlier work involved a feasibility study and we secured £157k funding to evaluate the process performance and commercial potential under various industrial scenarios, we and found that at small scales the cost of capture of the A3C process was up to 70% lower than the benchmark amine\-based process \[1\]. In our earlier work, carried out between October 2017 and December 2018, the University of Chester and PMW Technology developed a model using Aspen Plus® software \(material and energy balance process simulation tool\) to model and simulate the cryogenic process; the University of Sheffield produced a model and performed the economics of the benchmark amine\-based carbon capture process; and industrial partners WSP Consultants, DVN GL and Costain provided support for the design and costing of the A3C process \[2\]. 

 Subsequent work with PMW Technology has identified that the A3C process can be adapted to produce biomethane \(a green non\-fossil source of energy\) from agricultural waste converted through anaerobic digestion to upgraded biogas, which can then be injected into the gas grid \[4\]. 

 Further, our PhD student \(David Cann\), sponsored by the Eco\-Innovation European Regional Development Fund \(ERDF\) from October 2017 until September 2020, has built an experimental rig which demonstrates the fundamentals of the cryogenic separation process \[3\]. 

 Both projects have led to national and international conference presentations. The promising results are being used to support further grant applications, and the Transport\-Technology Research and Innovation Grants \(T\-TRIG\) project has secured funding from the Department for Transport from January to July 2020, with the aim to continue proving the concept and ultimately to build a pilot plant. 

 The strength of this innovative research was recognised through a Fossil Fuels Award at the Rushlight Show 2018\-19 for the outstanding A3C carbon capture process \[5\].

###  Impacts on commerce and the economy 

 A Thornton Science Park\-based start\-up company, PMW Technology \(founded in August 2016\), was created as a result of preparing a project proposal and securing Innovate UK funding to perform a feasibility study of the concept for cryogenic carbon capture and identification of its commercial applications \[1\]. The collaboration has involved knowledge transfer from the University to the start\-up company \[2, 3\] on process simulation, resulting in creation of one job for a process analyst. 

 This research collaboration has led to the design of a novel process to remove carbon dioxide from industrial sources \[4\]. The technology offers economic advantages over existing well\-established technologies, offering a cost\-effective way forward for industries where carbon capture is difficult by conventional methodologies. The A3C process has potential applications in diverse areas such as marine decarbonisation and in food, drink, and metals sectors, where high purity CO<sub>2</sub> captured from exhaust gases can be directly recycled to replace imported gas. 

 The innovative A3C process is already attracting interest from larger industrial partners: Thyson Technology is willing to invest in this development and commercialisation for biogas upgrading. Subject to raising investment to build a pilot plant, Thyson Technology \[5\] have committed to an investment of £250k. In a second collaboration, Houlder Ltd is interested in a marine transport application to aid decarbonisation of shipping \[6\] and has become an industrial partner through the feasibility study ‘Decarbonising the Transport System \- Evaluation of the Marine Application of Advanced Carbon Capture Technology.’ This is funded through the Transport\-Technology Research and Innovation Grants \(T\-TRIG\) programme of the Department for Transport. The A3C process offers a relatively simple solution to marine decarbonisation that may be 50% cheaper than switching to alternative fuels. 

 This project has generated societal impact through inspiring undergraduate students to do research placements. Five undergraduate students have undertaken research placements and one MEng student has collaborated with the research group on this research project, extending their experience and enthusiasm for careers in industry\-relevant research \[7\]. 

###  Impacts on the environment 

 The A3C process is an essential mechanism to deliver the urgent need for reduction of significant greenhouse gas emission from different sectors. The lower cost and more widely applicable technology gives rise to opportunities to implement carbon capture in industries where conventional methods have proved difficult. 

 The A3C process requires less than 150 kWh/tCO<sub>2</sub> for separation and is simple to apply as no heat or hazardous chemicals are required, thereby adding a secondary benefit to the environment.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by Professor Buckland involved the development of distance sampling methods and the associated software package *Distance,* which is now the global industry standard. *Distance* was downloaded from 22,150 distinct email addresses from 181 countries between August 2013 and July 2020.  These methods are vital for estimating the size of natural populations, and are widely used by government agencies for management and conservation \(e.g. NOAA in the US and Defra in the UK\), by international commissions that manage natural resources \(e.g. International Whaling Commission, Inter\-America Tropical Tuna Commission, International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas\), and by NGOs \(e.g. Wildlife Conservation Society, BirdLife International, World Wildlife Fund for Nature\). Population estimates obtained using our methods are used to inform plans to conserve threatened species \(e.g. polar bears of the Barents Sea\), to manage the cull or take of harvested populations \(e.g. Atlantic bluefin tuna\), and, increasingly, to monitor biodiversity trends \(e.g. the BTO/Defra/JNCC/RSPB Wild Bird Indicators\).

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 To monitor biodiversity and to manage wildlife, it is necessary to estimate the size of populations.  The most common method for estimating abundance of vertebrates is distance sampling.  This comprises a suite of methods that involve estimating distances to detected animals from lines or points, allowing detectability to be modelled, so that animal counts can be converted to abundance estimates. 

 The distance sampling team was established at St Andrews in the 1990s and the key areas of development since 2000 are: 

1.  Model\-based distance sampling methods \(Buckland, Borchers, Oedekoven\): to extend the applicability of distance sampling, it was necessary to develop a fully model\-based approach, rather than to rely solely on a design\-based approach.  We published the first formulation of a fully model\-based approach in 2002 \(R1\).  Generalisations of this approach appeared in 2013, 2014 and 2016.  The last of these shows that the methods developed by Royle and colleagues in the US in 2004 and 2008 are a special case of the methods we published in our 2002 book \(R2\). 

1.  Spatial distance sampling \(Borchers, Buckland\): this work was started by a research student, with the key publication being selected as the best JABES paper of 2004\-05 \(R3\).  With the input of Lindgren \(now at Edinburgh University\), INLA \(an advanced spatial modelling tool\) was used to provide an improved mathematical underpinning of spatial distance sampling \(R4\). 

1.  Camera\-trap distance sampling \(Buckland\): camera\-trap surveys have rapidly become a widely used method for monitoring vertebrate diversity.  For animals that are individually identifiable from images \(usually due to unique natural markings\), spatial capture\-recapture methods provide a powerful method for estimate abundance.  However, methods that can be used on species for which individuals are not recognisable are less satisfactory.  We therefore developed a distance\-sampling approach for use in such surveys \(R5\). 

1.  Distance sampling software \(Thomas, Buckland\): the methodological developments described above are implemented through regular new releases of the software *Distance* \(R6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 The distance sampling methods developed at the University of St Andrews are widely used as an abundance estimation tool by natural resource managers for monitoring the status of populations of conservation concern \(example impact: actions triggered by trends in abundance estimates under the US Marine Mammal Protection Act\), for managing the take of harvested populations \(example impact: quotas for Atlantic bluefin tuna set based on aerial survey estimates of biomass\), and for routine, often statutory, monitoring of biodiversity trends \(example impact: Defra policy is influenced by biodiversity trends as measured by the Wild Bird Indicator, one of 15 headline UK Quality of Life Indicators\). 

 **Providing the global standard software for estimating animal abundance from sightings surveys** 

 The Distance team at St Andrews has disseminated its work through a multi\-pronged, sustained strategy:  1. Publish methodological developments in top journals. 2. Publish introductory and advanced texts. 3. Provide user\-friendly software *Distance*. 4. Back this up with responsive support via email and an online forum. 5. Provide annual training workshops, and a free online course. 6. Publish papers that promote best practice in ecology and taxon\-specific journals, targeting wildlife managers. 7. Provide a consultancy service to key user groups.  The Royal Statistical Society recognised the success of this strategy by awarding Buckland with the Guy Medal in Gold in 2019.  Part of the citation for this award read: “ *Stephen has opened up advanced statistical methods to the user community by leading the development of freely\-available software \(notably Distance now with over 50,000 \[people\] users from 130 countries\) and associated core textbooks*.” \[S1\]. 

 Our *Distance* Windows software is the global industry standard and has been downloaded from 22,150 distinct email addresses from 181 countries between 1st August 2013 and 31st July 2020.  \(The figures in the above quote correspond to an overlapping but mostly earlier time period.\)  The official reference for *Distance* is R6, and as of 26 August 2020, Google Scholar showed 2,075 citations for this paper.  The software *Unmarked* is the only serious competitor; its official reference is Fiske and Chandler \(J Stat Software, 2011\), and had 1,409 citations in Google Scholar on the same date.  As *Unmarked* is for use on a wider set of methods, many of those citations do not relate to distance sampling. 

 Although research papers establish the credibility and utility of methods, it is crucial to publish textbooks and tutorial\-style papers to make the methods more accessible to the user community.  Buckland is senior author of all four books that are dedicated to distance sampling:  an initial book in 1993, an introductory book in 2001, an advanced book in 2004, which have led to the current a book on methods and applications, “ [Distance Sampling: Methods and Applications](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319192185?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=commission_junction&utm_campaign=3_nsn6445_brand_PID4003003&utm_content=de_textlink)” published in 2015.  We also offer a series of annual training workshops, which include online workshops.  Software development plays a key part in making methods accessible.  Underpinning research \(Section 2\) is implemented in the software on an ongoing basis, and since August 2013, the following features have been available or implemented:  a link to the free statistical software R, providing a major expansion in analytical capabilities;  a density surface modelling \(DSM\) analysis engine, written as a library in R;  a simulation engine and a multi\-analysis engine;  point transect analyses for the MRDS \(mark\-recapture distance sampling\) and DSM engines;  a Shape Import Wizard.  In parallel with these developments, the methods of *Distance* for Windows have progressively been made available through R packages \(Miller *et a*l., J Stat Software, 2019;  [http://distancesampling.org/](http://distancesampling.org/)\). 

 **Supporting MCS compliance of the eastern tropical Pacific tuna fishing industry** 

 The eastern tropical Pacific \(ETP\) is a massive area that extends from Central America to Hawaii, and from California to Peru.  ETP tuna purse seine fleets use fishing methods that result in some dolphin mortality. There is a need to monitor trends in the affected species of dolphins, to assess whether the industry is having a negative impact on populations.  In the absence of such a study, tuna exports from Mexico to the US are under threat.  \(Mexican exports of tuna are worth over USD150,000,000 per year, with the US accounting for well over half.\)  The US used to conduct surveys at a cost of around USD10,000,000 per year, but have now stopped, due to budget cuts.  Our multiple\-covariate distance sampling methods were used to analyse the sightings data \( [https://www.int\-res.com/abstracts/meps/v291/p1\-21/](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v291/p1-21/)\).  Their final survey was in 2006.  On the basis of the US stock assessments that use our methods and other evidence, the Marine Stewardship Council \(MSC\) for sustainable fishing awarded the Pacific Alliance for Sustainable Tuna \(PAST\) MSC certification in 2017.  One of the conditions of the award required: “ *significant financial investment in an international research program to assess dolphin populations in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean*”.  A research programme is now underway to satisfy this condition.  Oedekoven \(PI\) and Buckland \(CI\) are working closely with the Inter\-American Tropical Tuna Commission and PAST to implement a new survey, and they coordinated a trial shipboard and aerial drone survey off Mexico in November 2019.  The methods of analysis for the data are based on our model\-based distance sampling research \(R2\), using both multiple\-covariate and mark\-recapture distance sampling.  The subsequent main survey has been delayed by the Covid\-19 lockdown.  The Director of the Inter\-American Tropical Tuna Commission, notes that our methods are “ *key to determining whether the purse\-seine fleet that catches tunas found in association with dolphins can continue to fish for tuna with the confidence that the fishery is sustainable*” \[S2\]. 

 **Quantifying the effect of climate change on marine mammals in the Arctic for monitoring purposes** 

 We have also worked with scientists in Denmark and Norway to design and analyse surveys of populations of beluga whales \(survey conducted in 2012, estimates published in 2017\), bowhead whales \(survey conducted in 2006, revised estimates published in September 2013\) and polar bears \(survey conducted in 2015, estimates published in 2017\).  These surveys are important as they allow population trajectories to be estimated, and the impact of ice loss in the Arctic to be assessed.  Our methods \(R6\) allow estimation of abundance from the data recorded on aerial and shipboard surveys.  The Head of the Norwegian Polar Institute’s Polar Bear Programme, which advises Norwegian authorities on matters concerning polar environmental management, comments:  “ *Your methods have played a key role in establishing the status of the Barents Sea polar bear population, so that we can monitor the impact on this keystone predator as summer sea ice cover reduces* …” \[S3\], while a Professor of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources comments:  “ *Your \[Buckland’s\] methods have played a key role in understanding the effects of sea\-ice loss on beluga whale distribution and abundance, and on the population trajectories of bowhead whales and narwhals off Greenland.”* \[S4\]. By quantifying size of populations and time trends in the size, our methods allow the impact of climate change on Arctic marine mammals to be monitored. 

 **Changing professional practice for monitoring biodiversity of terrestrial vertebrates** 

 In 2017, we developed camera\-trap distance sampling \(CTDS\) to allow estimation of population sizes \(R5\).  The method is being applied to monitor vertebrate diversity in a range of terrestrial environments, from the Himalayas to desert.  Its greatest impact has been in quantifying biodiversity of rain forests, for which wildlife surveys are particularly difficult to conduct and biodiversity trends problematic to estimate, given the dense vegetation.  A Senior Scientist and Project Manager of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology notes that the following organisations have switched to using CTDS for monitoring in rain forests:  World Wildlife Fund, Wildlife Conservation Society, Wild Chimpanzee Foundation, the government of Guinea, and the Office Ivoirien des Parcs et Réserves \[S5\].  The first two organisations monitor rain forests across Africa, Asia and the Americas. 

 **Providing a scientific basis for two proposed Scottish Marine Protected Areas** 

 To safeguard marine biodiversity around Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage \(renamed NatureScot in 2020\) proposed the Southern Trench Marine Protected Area \(MPA\) in 2014 and the North\-east Lewis MPA in 2019, whose boundaries were chosen based on SNH commissioned reports  [573](https://www.nature.scot/naturescot-commissioned-report-573-review-available-statistical-approaches-help-identify-marine) and  [594](https://www.nature.scot/naturescot-commissioned-report-594-statistical-approaches-aid-identification-marine-protected-areas), published in 2014, which used our distance sampling and density surface modelling methods \(R3\).  These reports were commissioned because at that time, no quantitative evidence was available on which to propose MPAs and their boundaries \[S6, S7\]. 

 **Contributing to wildlife management on a global scale with diverse applications of** Distance **software** 

 Our *Distance* software and distance sampling methods are used for a wide range of surveys.  Between 1 Aug 2013 and 26 August 2020, Google Scholar lists 2,075 publications that cite R6, and most of these are studies that have used our software to address wildlife management issues. We list a small sample of the studies published in the first 5 months of 2019 that do so to illustrate the diversity of applications and wildlife issues addressed:  management of declining populations of Arabian gazelles;  assessing impact of poaching on ungulate populations in Iran;  estimating the distribution and abundance of guanacos \(a species of conservation concern\) in Patagonia;  managing livestock and populations of large wild mammals in the Yaeda Valley in Tanzania;  estimating chimpanzee densities in the Ivory Coast so that population trends can be monitored;  assessing viability of Madagascar lemur populations;  managing rabbit populations on the Iberian Peninsula;  estimating feral cat densities in an urban environment;  improving ringed seal density estimates, so that harvests can be managed more effectively;  modelling the spatial abundance of fin whales in the Gulf of St Lawrence;  estimating blue whale density off California so that their recovery may be assessed;  effect of windfarms on upland bird densities;  evaluating methods for assessing abundance of a forest songbird in the US;  monitoring forest bird populations in New Zealand;  estimating the sizes of raptor populations in Uganda’s conservation areas;  response of reptiles to fire in NW Africa \[S8\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Based upon University of Manchester \(UoM\) research, the Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle, a quality improvement programme to identify and manage risk factors for stillbirth, has been implemented nationally. Implementation reduced stillbirth by 20% in all 19 NHS Trust early adopter units, saving 161 stillbirths in these units. In 2019/20, implementation of the care bundle was incorporated into the standard NHS contract. UoM studies describing women’s experiences after stillbirth and in pregnancies after loss have underpinned regional, national and international guidelines for the care of women who experience a stillbirth. Public awareness campaigns based upon our research including \#sleeponside and \#movementsmatter have reached >2,500,000 women in the UK and internationally. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2014, the UK stillbirth rate ranked in the lowest third of high\-income countries at 1 in 219 births, with 3,563 stillbirths occurring in the UK in 2014.The National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit’s Listening to Parents report \(2014\) found that whilst quality of care for bereaved parents was generally good, there were gaps in care and variability between services. Changes were needed both to improve stillbirth rates in UK and to better help families deal with the loss of a baby. 

 UoM research has focussed on three main themes: i\) understanding of conditions associated with stillbirth, ii\) identifying risk factors for stillbirth and iii\) using this information to improve the quality of clinical care to prevent stillbirths and enhance the quality of care following a stillbirth. 

 In the first theme, UoM researchers conducted basic scientific studies to demonstrate placental dysfunction in women with an increased risk of stillbirth including: fetal growth restriction, maternal obesity, women with a perceived reduction in fetal movements, maternal diabetes and mothers over 40 years of age. This has provided a crucial scientific basis to associate these risk factors with stillbirth \[1\]. Heazell also undertook systematic reviews to demonstrate the frequency and significance of placental lesions as a cause of stillbirth \[2\]. As a result, there is now an established link between risk factors, placental dysfunction and stillbirth. 

 Since 2010 UoM has developed “research clinics” to better identify placental dysfunction in women at high\-risk of fetal growth restriction including women whose previous pregnancies were complicated by fetal growth restriction, hypertension or stillbirth. UoM researchers used these clinics to develop and test clinical algorithms to improve outcomes for mothers and babies and have conducted national multicentre studies to investigate the impact of better screening and treatment for fetal growth restriction and management of reduced fetal movements. 

 Heazell led the largest case\-control study of novel risk factors for stillbirth \(Midlands and North of England Stillbirth Study, n=1,035\) which demonstrated an independent association between maternal going\-to\-sleep position and late stillbirth \[3\]. UoM’s subsequent collaboration in an international individual patient data meta\-analysis identified underpinning mechanisms. The UoM team were co\-investigators on the AFFIRM study the largest ever clinical trial of the management of reduced fetal movements \(n=409,175\), leading site visits, writing the protocol, analysing and disseminating study findings \[4\]. This study provided important data emphasising the importance of testing, after women attend with reduced movements, as detection of small infants \(compared to gestational age\) improved, but also indicated that unwarranted intervention may increase Caesarean section without clear benefit. 

 Heazell’s mixed\-methods study was the first to describe bereaved parents’ experiences in the UK for over 20 years. This study has provided evidence for effective care practices and those that were detrimental to parents \[5\]. In addition, these studies demonstrated barriers and facilitators to post\-mortem consent in women who have had a stillbirth, allowing care to be restructured and optimised to maximise the information obtained for parents about the cause of their baby’s death \[6\]. Heazell’s systematic review of care in pregnancies after stillbirth and cross\-sectional studies describing care in pregnancies after stillbirth in the UK has led to leadership and generation of an international consensus statement for the care of women in pregnancies after stillbirth. This body of evidence has made a significant contribution to data regarding parents’ experiences following the death of their baby.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Pathways to impact 

-  **Parliamentary POST notes:** UoM research cited informing MPs about stillbirth issues \(POSTbrief 21 July 2016, Bereavement Care, POSTNOTE 527, May 2016, Infant Mortality and Stillbirth in the UK\). 

-  **Heazell presented to All Party Parliamentary Group on Baby Loss \(2016\):** Co\-chair described Manchester’s hospitals as displaying best practice with their stillbirth\-specific integrated pathway. 

-  **Patient guidance:** UoM research informed patient\-information leaflets from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists \(RCOG\), Kick’s Counts, Tommy’s \(for NHS England\), StillAware \(Australian charity\) and \#movementsmatter campaign \(published 24 Oct 2016, >65,100 YouTube views\). 

-  **International \#sleeponside campaign:** Launched in 2018, by Tommy’s, to educate mothers about sleeping position in late pregnancy \[3\]. Tommy’s estimate this reached >2,500,000 women globally. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

###  **20% reduction in stillbirth followed Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle’s introduction in 19 UK early adopter trusts** 

 In 2014, NHS England launched the four element Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle. The third element focussing on Reduced Fetal Movements was authored by Heazell and underpinned by UoM research \[Ai\]. In 2018, UoM conducted the SPiRE study to determine the bundle’s impact on pregnancy outcomes. Stillbirths were reduced by 20% over the implementation period \(2015\-2017\) \[Aii\]. UoM’s findings informed the bundle’s second iteration \(released March 2019\) which included the sleep on side message \[Ai, 4\]. National Clinical Director for Maternity and Women’s Health, NHS England noted, “ *Heazell’s research contribution was an important factor in allowing us to make these positive changes. In my view, the development and subsequent evaluation is an excellent example of how translational research can be used to effect positive change in NHS services*” \[B\]. Implementing the bundle was included in NHS planning guidance and incorporated into the standard NHS contract for 2019/20. 

###  Influence on Australian Safer Baby Bundle 

 UoM findings influenced the Australian Safer Baby Bundle \(SBB\), launched in 2019. Heazell was an international advisor. SBB handbook states it is *“based on the approach used in the UK Bundle Versions One and Two*” \[Ci,3,4\]. Victoria’s Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services confirmed, “ *There is no question that we would not have been able to develop the Safer Baby Bundle without the resources and insights…generously shared by Professor Heazell…an example of how sharing research insights can rapidly enable application internationally*”. He confirmed, “ *initial evaluation of the care bundle in 21 Victorian maternity services is that it has been associated with a reduction in stillbirth by 27%”* \[Cii\] *.* 

###  National/international clinical guidance 

 UoM reduced fetal movements work was cited as best practice in: guidance from RCOG \(reviewed 2014 and  2017\) \[Di\]; Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand \[Dii\]; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \[Diii\]; national Perinatal Confidential Enquiries into stillbirth \(2015 \[Ei\], 2017 \[Eii\]\). 

###  Creation of North West Regional Stillbirth Care Pathway 

 Initiated in 2014/5, updated in 2018, UoM’s research was cited in North\-West regional stillbirth care pathway guidelines \[5,6,Fi, Fii\]. A pathway audit in August 2016 demonstrated 25% more women were: receiving information; being cared for in labour more safely; and accessing investigations to determine the cause of stillbirth \[Fiii\]. 

###  Creation of National Perinatal Post Mortem Consent Package and Bereavement Care Pathway 

 In January 2013, Sands \(Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Charity\) launched a perinatal post mortem consent package and training programme. Sands confirmed Heazell’s *“research informed the development of the...package and substantially aided our efforts in producing this important resource, which benefits both health professionals and parents*” \[G,6\]. A 2016 maternity unit audit of UK’s bereavement care provision demonstrated 52 UK Trusts use the package and, of these, 85% believed it had improved staff confidence \[H\]. 

 In 2017, Sands launched a national bereavement care pathway \(NBCP\) and audit tools, stating UoM “ *research into post\-mortem consent, the value of investigations and parent’s experiences following stillbirth was instrumental in informing Sands as we developed and launched the…documents*” \[G,5\]. A 2020 NBCP progress report documented, within the pilot sites, that 76% of professionals aware of the pathway agreed that bereavement care improved during the pilot \[I\]. The pathway was rolled out nationally in October 2018. Sands confirmed, by August 2020, 52% of English sites have fully committed to NBCP and 99% have engaged with NBCP in some way \[G\]. Additionally 5 Scottish NHS Boards are currently piloting the NBCP as early adopters \[G\]. 

 In 2014, ‘Listening to Parents after Stillbirth’ reported only half of women whose baby died before labour felt involved in decision making and confident about decisions made at the time. By contrast, NBCP’s 2020 progress report found 89% felt decisions they made in hospital were the right ones at the time, 89% felt communication was sensitive and they received information about relevant support organisations. 92% agreed they were treated with respect \[I\], demonstrating NBCP’s positive impact for these parents. 

###  Improved care delivered in pregnancies after stillbirth 

 A clinic model for care in pregnancies after stillbirth was developed from UoM’s systematic review of women and families’ needs in these pregnancies. Over 800 families have been treated at Manchester’s Rainbow Clinic since January 2014, which provides specialist care for pregnant women who have previously had a stillbirth and supports partners and family. It was cited in a Parliamentary debate as an example of excellent care \[Ji\]. 

 Manchester’s Rainbow Clinic has improved clinical outcomes. A 2016 review showed it had reduced: preterm birth \(10% *vs* 21%\); and low birthweight infant numbers \(9% *vs* 18%\) \[Jii\]. An independent study by NEF Consulting found clinic attendance reduced anxiety and post\-natal depression \[Jiii\]. It also demonstrated the Rainbow Clinic gave tangible healthcare financial benefits of GBP6.10 of benefit per pound invested solely from clinical outcomes \[Jiii\]. 

 Twelve satellite Rainbow Clinics have opened in the UK to date, delivering the UoM care model with a further 25 in development. Further afield, UoM researchers are working with care providers wishing to adopt the model in Melbourne \(Australia\), Toronto \(Canada\) and Wisconsin \(USA\).

 Research undertaken by Dr Gearoid Millar at the University of Aberdeen’s Institute for Conflict Transition and Peace Research has examined the role and impact of external interventions in post\-conflict societies. Millar has made an important contribution to better understanding how external actors in post\-conflict societies can hinder the prospects of long\-term peace. Millar has shown both how external organisations can negatively affect local communities, contrary to their intended goal, and how scholarly work can better understand these errors and contribute to better policy. As such, the research has impacted the advocacy work of international organizations and non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) attempting to inform policy.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Aiming to promote job creation and sustainable economic growth, Development Finance Institutions \(DFIs\) invest heavily in private sector projects in low, middle\-income, and often conflict affected countries. Despite their intentions to create productive employment and facilitate peace, particularly in post\-conflict societies, these development projects can also adversely affect local communities when they fail to recognize the complex sociocultural, political, and economic environments into which they intervene. As such, a gap exists in the development finance sector in the lack of methodologies for assessing the long\-term impacts of development interventions and the lived experience of DFI\-funded projects on the communities they seek to support. 

 Dr Gearoid Millar’s work has addressed these problems in two ways. The first is by providing an in\-depth examination of one case \(Addax Bioenergy\) in Sierra Leone that has led to substantial contributions to the understandings and advocacy work of a number of Land Rights and Food Security NGOs \[2\-7\]. And the second is through the development of the Ethnographic Peace Research \(EPR\) approach, which is a means of assessing the impact of international interventions from the perspective of local individuals and communities in post\-conflict societies \[1\]. Both of these elements are intertwined and exhibit the contribution Millar has made to this important field of policy and intervention practice \[6\]. 

 Through the former, for example, and by focusing on the role and impact of the Addax project in Sierra Leone, Millar has demonstrated how a corporation sought to produce ethanol in rural Sierra Leone for export to Europe, claimed that the project would be a ‘positive social actor’, and engaged with local communities in order to employ local labour whilst claiming to protect local livelihoods and food security \[3\-5\]. Millar’s work however, illustrates the highly damaging impacts of the project on the customary order and structures of authority within the area of the project \[3, 7\], on women’s livelihoods and security \[4\], and through the generation of new conflicts over the resources the company inject into this highly unequal and impoverished economy \[5\]. His work shows that the investment landscape in conflict affected societies is far more complex than appreciated and that a substantial level of unpredictability results from the interaction between global and local actors. As a result, the powerful interveners often fail to understand the potential fallout of their actions and very often that their interventions do not contribute to sustainable peace \[5\]. 

 The EPR approach Millar has developed and promoted is central to overcoming this failure on the part of DFIs and the projects they fund. This approach is widely cited as a tool by which to understand the complex interaction of global and local actors in peacebuilding interventions \(Kreikemeyer, 2020,  [<ins>Pingeot</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13533312.2019.1673739), 2019,  [<ins>Richmond</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2019.1637729), 2018;  [<ins>Brauchler</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21647259.2017.1368158?scroll=top&needAccess=true), 2017\). His EPR method deviates from the standard practice in the field and encourages semi\-structured interviews, participant observation and extensive qualitative field notes to generate grounded understandings of how local individuals and communities perceive and experience international interventions. It acts as a methodological roadmap for developing relevant and accessible forms of data that can bring to the fore local voices and local contexts, and encourages knowledge exchange between scholars and peace practitioners \[1, 6\]. These two contributions together have impacted on the advocacy efforts and achievements of international organizations and NGOs which seek to influence how DFIs approach post\-conflict and development investments.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research undertaken by Dr Millar at the University of Aberdeen has directly impacted the advocacy efforts of international and domestic NGOs in their attempts to inform policy discussions regarding DFI\-funded investments in post\-conflict societies. In addition, his work has introduced a roadmap by which DFIs and the projects they fund can be held accountable in order to limit the corporate deployment of power in rural Africa that has already negatively impacted communities. 

 **Providing an evidence base for NGO advocacy** 

 Millar’s research in Sierra Leone has provided a detailed evidence base that has enabled NGOs to analyse the developmental impact of European and other DFIs and to advocate for changes based on those impacts. Swedwatch, for example, a Swedish NGO dedicated to investigating the extent to which companies take responsibility for human rights and the environment through responsible investment, used an early draft of Millar’s paper titled ‘We have no voice for that’ \(published in the *Journal of Human Rights* in 2015\), as the basis for a high\-profile 2013 report titled ‘ [<ins>Utan Mark, Utan Makt’</ins>](https://swedwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/swedwatch_-_utan_mark_utan_makt.pdf), \(translated as ‘ [No land no power](https://swedwatch.org/en/regions/africa-south-of-the-sahara/no-land-no-power/)’\) \[S1\]. The report argues that; despite Addax’s ambitious sustainability targets, they needed a ‘clearer rights perspective’ in the investment venture, so that women could participate and benefit from the project. The lead researcher from Swedwatch stated that: 

 \(Millar’s research\) *strengthened our focus on and understanding of the gendered impacts and the need to highlight them both as human rights impacts in themselves but also to see the linkages between gendered impacts and conflict* \[S2\]. 

 Sweden’s national broadcaster, SverigesRadio, then highlighted the new focus enabled by Millar’s ethnographic research. As they noted when discussing the Swedwatch report: 

 *According to a report presented today, it is mainly the women in the area who have been affected…The report has focused on women’s rights – as it is a stated goal of Swedish aid policy… according to the report, the communication works poorly between Addax Bioenergy and the locals* \[S3\]. 

 Following on from these early uses of Millar’s research findings, a 2017 briefing paper released by the Dutch NGO, Fern – commissioned to track European Union involvement in forested regions and the rights of people who depend on them – drew heavily on Millar’s research and used the bioenergy project \(now controlled by Sunbird Bioenergy Mabilafu\) as one of the primary case studies \[S4\]. As well as concluding that the project had an overall negative impact on the local population, the briefing advocated for a set of recommendations that align with Millar’s findings; evidencing how Millar’s research directly informed Fern’s advocacy efforts. 

 This impact can be seen most directly in the 2020 monitoring report \[S5\] jointly prepared by one national NGO \(the Sierra Leone Network on the Right to Food – SiLNoRF, Austria\), and one international NGO \(Brot Für Alle \- Bread for All\), a Swiss\-based organisation and member of a multi\-partner network\). This report draws directly on Millar’s research and culminates in recommendations to Sunbird, to the government of Sierra Leone, and to local stakeholders, again based on Millar’s findings.  As the author of the report, Land Rights Expert in Sierra Leone has stated \[S6\]: 

 *Dr Miller’s research has provided valuable insights to the lived experiences of communities affected by the project, strengthening the argument that large scale monocultures are by no means ‘sustainable’ developments. Dr Millar’s research publications have underpinned a number of the central arguments of our report and providing evidence that clarifies which lands were used, the cost of these negotiations and gendered impacts of the negotiations*. 

 The author goes on to note that: 

 *Dr Millar’s findings have contributed towards our efforts to begin addressing the knowledge gap that exists and communicating findings to the current company involved at the project site, to policymakers, and to the DFIs in order to create a platform to facilitate much needed dialogue as well as raising awareness amongst stakeholders of the ongoing issues facing communities and providing a voice to those disadvantaged by operations*. 

 Bread For All Agricultural and Land Rights Expert \(Sierra Leon and Liberia\) corroborated the value of Millar’s research to the report, highlighting Millar’s role in ‘clarifying which lands were used, the cost of these negotiations’ stating \[S7\]: 

 *The work of Dr Millar supported Bread For All in defining a strong position on large\-scale land acquisitions based on scientific evidence. This kind of evidence also helps us in our lobby work towards the governments in Sierra Leone, towards the DFIs and also the company*. 

 **Enhancing understanding of the challenges surrounding foreign direct investment in post\-conflict societies** 

 While the narrative above evidences Millar’s impact on NGO advocacy work regarding DFI supported projects in Sierra Leone, his larger effort to develop the EPR approach to better allow peace studies scholars to contribute to advocacy and policy formation has impacted on how scholars contribute to policy and practice. Millar’s work has also been widely shared for public readership, including through *The Conversation*, farmlandgrab.org in 2016 \( [https://bit.ly/2OzSFdt](https://bit.ly/2OzSFdt)\) and in the *Huffington Post* in 2016 \( [https://bit.ly/3cjDeyn](https://bit.ly/3cjDeyn)\) \[S8\]. Aimed primarily at a targeted audience of NGOs, journalists, and social activists, the articles explore the role of DFIs in funding international projects that fail to uphold humanitarian and environmental sustainability goals; goals that DFIs explicitly cite as their raison d’etre. 

 As noted above, the EPR approach is widely cited by scholars as a tool by which to understand the complex interaction of global and local actors in peacebuilding interventions \(Kreikemeyer, 2020,  [<ins>Pingeot</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13533312.2019.1673739), 2019,  [<ins>Richmond</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2019.1637729), 2018;  [<ins>Brauchler</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21647259.2017.1368158?scroll=top&needAccess=true), 2017\), but in 2018, the Peace Science Digest also undertook an analysis of Millar’s research and found something similar \[S9\]. Peace Science Digest is a project of the  [War Prevention Initiative](https://warpreventioninitiative.org/) of the  [Jubitz Family Foundation](https://www.jubitz.org/) and it acts as a tool to facilitate change by translating academic texts for policy audiences and increasing the visibility and application of academic knowledge. As a result of their review, Peace Science Digest  stated that Millar’s work: 

 *examines one of the very concerns the Peace Science Digest was created to address: the difficult of making academic scholarship accessible and useful to peace practitioners*. 

 They further note that the research: 

 *brings up big, philosophical questions about the extent to which our actions can influence the world in the ways intended—with practical implications for how we understand our role in the world and the usefulness and value of our interventions* \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The impacts are generated via a set of novel and innovative technologies, called the CloudSME Simulation Platform \(CSSP\), the CloudiFacturing Platform \(CFGP\) and MiCADO, which were invented and developed across a string of European projects. Prof Kiss and his team was the lead partner driving the conceptualisation and implementation of CSSP and MiCADO, and they contributed significantly \(overall concept and 2 out of 5 platform components\) to CFGP. 

-  CSSP/CFGP has enabled 86 SMEs \(small and medium sized enterprises\) from over 20 European countries to generate an estimated cumulative turnover increase of 100 million Euros, approximately 550 new products or services, 650 new jobs, and 1,100 new business/commercial partners or customers by the end of 2020. 

-  CloudSME UG, a for\-profit start\-up company through which CSSP/CFGP and their MiCADO extension are primarily marketed, reported EUR 222,701 turnover in 2019, with 39,823 annual profit. 

-  Public sector organisations have also benefitted from the CSSP coupled with MiCADO. The local government of the Aragon region of Spain reported higher satisfaction towards government services, and \[text removed for publication\] \(UK\) estimated gains including 100 \(10%\) new business partners/customers, 212K Euros \(7.5%\) increase in turnover, 20% more efficient business processes, and 50% reduction in time to market by July 2019.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 CSSP/CFGP is a combination of novel and innovative technologies directly brought about by the Centre for Parallel Computing \(CPC\) team at the University of Westminster between 2005 and 2020, based on the following major research findings. 

##  Science gateways for interoperable grid and cloud infrastructures \( **Kiss**, **Terstyanszky**\): 

 CSSP/CFGP originates in **WS\-PGRADE/gUSE** \[1\], an open source **science gateway framework** \(an interface for those who want to use grid and cloud infrastructures\). WS\-PGRADE/gUSE is the outcome of five FP7 European  [<ins>projects</ins>](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/research/groups-and-centres/centre-for-parallel-computing/projects) between 2008 and 2014 that were either led by, or featured significant contributions from, the CPC team. The main contribution of the CPC was to extend the framework to provide **interoperability for applications, data and workflows,** as evidenced in \[1\]. WS\-PGRADE/gUSE was originally intended for academic users and grid computing platforms. However, with significant contribution from CPC within the  [<ins>SCI\-BUS</ins>](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/283481) \(Scientific Gateway\-based User Support\) project, the gateway framework was integrated with the commercial  [<ins>CloudBroker</ins>](http://cloudbroker.com/) platform so industry applications could be run on a **variety of cloud computing resources**. 

##  Generic cloud\-based simulation platform for industry \( **Kiss**, **Terstyanszky**, **Michalas**\): 

 The next stage of research, when the above commercial application came to be known as the CSSP \[2\] \[3\], was undertaken via the  [<ins>CloudSME</ins>](https://portal.effra.eu/project/1086) \(Cloud\-based Simulation Platform for Manufacturing and Engineering\) project that was led and coordinated by Westminster’s CPC \( **Kiss**\). CSSP was specifically tailored to support **large\-scale industry simulations on cloud resources**, especially within the manufacturing / engineering sector. CSSP specifically enables SMEs to use state of the art simulation technology in a cost\-efficient way. 

 To further enhance CSSP, research and development activities were funded by the H2020  [<ins>CloudiFacturing</ins>](https://www.cloudifacturing.eu/) \(Cloudification of Production Engineering for Predictive Digital Manufacturing\) project. The outcome of this research is the CloudiFacturing Platform \(CFGP\); a new and enhanced version of CSSP. CFGP supports the **dynamic combination of workflows** and features a newly developed service model for SMEs in the form of a dedicated **Digital Marketplace**. The CPC team was responsible for the development of its executable artefact \(workflow and application\) repository \( **Terstyanszky**\) and security framework \( **Michalas**\). Additionally, development of the workflow execution and data transfer components were strongly influenced by the work of the CPC from past EU projects \( [<ins>SHIWA</ins>](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/261585) \(2010\-2012\),  [<ins>ER\-FLOW</ins>](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/312579) \(2012\-2014\) \( **Kiss**, **Terstyanszky**\). 

##  Innovative cloud\-based business models \( **Kiss**, **Dagdeviren**\): 

 In order to further facilitate the industrial take\-up of CSSP, further research was carried out in the area of **cloud\-based business models,** with particular focus on the application of such business models for large scale simulations in manufacturing \[4\]. These business models enable software vendors to efficiently sell simulation services to manufacturing end\-users using a cloud\-based service provision model. 

##  Application\-level cloud orchestration \( **Kiss**, **Terstyanszky**, **Michalas**, **Pierantoni**\): 

 As part of the H2020 European  [<ins>COLA</ins>](https://project-cola.eu/) \(Cloud Orchestration at the Level of Application\) project, led by CPC \( **Kiss**\), the CSSP has been further extended with a **secure cloud orchestration framework** called  [<ins>MiCADO</ins>](https://micado-scale.eu/) \[5\]. MiCADO is an external service to the CSSP and allows for various services connected within the cloud to utilise the optimal amount of resources, thus boosting the efficiency of cloud\-based applications. The framework enables companies to run applications on various heterogeneous clouds and to define highly flexible scaling and security policies that govern the execution of their applications \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Simulation and optimisation can significantly improve the competitive position of companies and public sector organisations by reducing their costs as a result of more efficient development, production, procurement, logistics or financial processes. However, the take up of simulation / optimisation software by SMEs and the public sector has been low due to barriers of entry such as hardware prices, licensing costs and required technical expertise. With Prof Kiss and his team leading the research and technical development efforts, CSSP/CFGP, combined with MiCADO, proved efficient to **overcome these barriers** and has since generated significant **economic impact and further efficiency gains** for a large number of organisations in Europe. 

#  Impact on SME clients: 

 By April 2020, **86 SMEs from over 20 European countries** – manufacturing, engineering and technology companies that participated in the CloudSME, COLA and CloudiFacturing projects as beneficiaries or as Third Parties – reported the following estimated economic impact as a direct result of applying either CSSP or CFGP, in tandem with the MiCADO secure autoscaling framework: a cumulative yearly **turnover increase of over 100 million Euros**, the development of over **550 new / enhanced products or services**, contribution to the creation of **650 new jobs**, and the establishment of **1,100 new business/commercial partners or customers**. This economic impact occurred between 2015 and 2020. 

 These figures are evidenced in the official project reports/deliverables of the CloudSME, COLA, and CloudiFacturing projects that were provided by executives of the participating companies and approved by the European Commission \[a, b, c, d\]. This approval affirms the credibility and accuracy of the forecasted economic growth by these 86 companies, as attributable to the CPC’s research across these three projects. Figures 1, 2 and 3, on pages 4 and 5 below, summarise the above detailed numbers. 

 Figure 1 summarises the impact of CSSP on 24 companies within the CloudSME project. Figure 2 provides details of the economic impact of utilising MiCADO with the CSSP by 10 companies within COLA. Figure 3 encompasses the impact of the CFGP on 52 companies that were supported in three waves during the CloudiFacturing project \(please note that due to the very large number of companies, only cumulative figures are shown here, details are available in \[c,d\]\). 

 Additionally, these companies reported **improved business processes**, **improved business practices**, **reduction in time to market**, and **improved customer satisfaction**. Two online videos made by Hobsons Brewery \[e\], a UK\-based craft\-brewer, and Podoactiva \[f\], a Spanish manufacturer of tailored foot insoles, provide narrative accounts detailing these impacts. 

 Beyond the directly reported figures, it is also important to note that **significant economic impact has been generated for the clients of the directly supported / involved companies**, across a wide range of sectors. For instance, the Managing Director of Saker Solutions, which provides “ *a range of 3D simulation and modelling services*” to clients within industrial and commercial sectors and is one of the 86 SMEs mentioned above, states the company itself benefitted from “ *an increase in turnover of at least £200k pa since 2014 which has allowed us to employ additional staff”* and also estimates that *“over the last 7 years we have generated some £2 to £3 million of benefit”* for their clients: *“Primarily this benefit would be in the Nuclear sector but savings will have also been generated within Manufacturing, Defence and Retail*” \[g\]. He concludes that: “ *Overall, Prof Kiss has had a major impact on our company*” \[g\]. 

#  Impact on CloudSME UG; the commercial service provider: 

 CSSP/CFGP is primarily marketed and provided by **CloudSME UG**, a for\-profit start\-up company that also offers related expertise and consultancy to clients. Established in January 2016, the company’s profits have substantially grown through its continued collaboration with the Westminster researchers, as the Managing Partner confirms: *“the product and service portfolio offered by CloudSME UG is based and heavily relying on novel and innovative technologies that were invented, designed and implemented by Prof. Kiss and the Centre for Parallel Computing research team”* \[h\]. The technological and research contribution of the CPC in the creation of CSSP was also acknowledged via the appointment of Kiss as the Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the company. In this unpaid role, Kiss acts as their main scientific and technology consultant and helps to define their current and future direction. The company made steady growth on the market between 2016 and 2020 by securing and successfully delivering its commercial contracts. As a result of utilising the CSSP, CloudSME reported **222,701 Euros turnover in 2019**, with **39,823 Euros annual profit** \[h\]. 

 As CloudSME’s CEO states, since July 2019, “ *the product portfolio of my company* \[CloudSME\] *has been further extended and we are now offering fully managed professional cloud\-based services utilising MiCADO*” \[h\]. As part of this activity German Data Center HKN, their business partner, is offering fully managed  [<ins>enterprise data clusters</ins>](https://www.hkn.de/nextcloud/drei-loesungsansaetze-nextcloud) based on MiCADO. CloudSME expects an **additional contribution of 387,030 Euros to its turnover** by the end of 2020 as a direct result of commercialising MiCADO, as evidenced in document \[i\]. 

#  Impact on Government and Charity Sectors: 

 Within the COLA project public sector organisations, namely the Aragon Local Government \(ALG\) in Spain and \[text removed for publication\], a charity organisation funded by the UK Arts Council, have also benefitted from the CSSP coupled with MiCADO \[b\]. These organisations run data intensive web applications for which resources are managed and optimised by MiCADO. 

 Applications offered by ALG via its public company SARGA – which “ *acts as manager of all public infrastructures and services related to agriculture and environment*” – utilise the CSSP and MiCADO, and the technical solutions provided by the CPC team “ *have improved the recommendation engines of the Aragón Government in order to **provide better services to the people of Aragón and to result in higher general satisfaction within the people of the region**” \[j\]. SARGA and ALG representatives specify that: “ *Based on the technical solution invented and developed by **Prof Kiss and his team**,* *the operational organization of our IT infrastructure have improved significantly”* such that *“we have **achieved more efficient processes related to software development and public services delivery**” \[j\]. 

 By July 2019, \[text removed for publication\] had achieved an estimated increase of **100 \(10%\) new business partners/customers**, **212K Euros \(7.5%\) increase in turnover**, **20% more efficient business processes**, **3% increase in employment**, **50% reduction in time to market**, **10% increase in customer satisfaction**, and **4 \(15%\)** **new service offerings** as a result of applying MiCADO \[b\]. The company’s planned exploitation of CSSP and MICADO is expected to have increased, by Jan 2022, to 200 \(20%\) new business partners/customers, 1.35 million Euros \(15%\) increase in turnover, 30% more efficient business processes, 6% increase in employment, 50% reduction in time to market, 30% increase in customer satisfaction, and 8 \(30%\) new service offerings, as a result of applying CSSP and MiCADO \[b\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Emotional detachment in surgical practice remains central to popular understandings of effective practice. The Wellcome Trust Investigator Award project ‘Surgery & Emotion’ \(2016\-20\), led by Michael Brown, explores the emotional cultures of British surgery from 1800 to the present and has challenged historical and contemporary preconceptions. The project’s research interrogates and complicates entrenched ideas about the timelessness of, and necessity for, emotional detachment in surgical practice. Through collaborative workshops, policy statements and public engagement events, the research has: 

1.  promoted and shaped debates within the surgical profession about the importance of emotion and emotional intelligence in collaboration with the Royal College of Surgeons \(RCS\) and the Royal College of Nursing \(RCN\); 

1.  enhanced clinical practice and enabled and shaped advocacy; and 

1.  challenged widely\-held stereotypes about surgical culture and identity, bringing together practitioners and the public to discuss the emotional complexities and demands of surgical practice. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Surgeons are not noted for emotional intelligence or wellbeing; the former heart surgeon Sir Stephen Westaby claimed ‘you’ve got to have the characteristics of a psychopath to make a good surgeon’. Such comments feed negative stereotypes. Within the profession, bullying and other forms of domineering behaviour are rife. Stress and burnout are a common feature of surgical careers, and relations with patients are often characterised by poor communication and emotional detachment. Outside of the profession, surgeons are often regarded as aloof, arrogant and uncaring, even if heroic. The research for the Surgery & Emotion project challenges these stereotypes through historical methodologies, demonstrating to practitioners and public alike that emotions have played a longstanding and vital role in the cultures and practice of surgery. 

 The research grew out of work by Brown \( **R1**\), which considered a highly\-publicised botched operation undertaken at Guy’s Hospital in 1828. This prompted questions about the emotive language used to critique the surgeon concerned and the perceived failings of his emotional demeanour. To answer these, and related, questions, Brown developed a broad\-ranging project exploring the emotional landscape of surgery from 1800 to the present. This project was funded by a Wellcome Trust Investigator Award \( **G1**\) and a subsequent Research Enrichment \- Public Engagement award \( **G2**\). 

 Brown’s research involved extensive archival work in such repositories as the RCS, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh \(RCSEd\), and the Wellcome Library. It encompassed printed and manuscript materials including letters, diaries, casebooks and images, offering an unprecedented insight into the history of surgery. Brown explicated the emotional cultures of ‘Romantic surgery’, from c.1790s to c.1850, an era defined in historical retrospect by the absence of anaesthesia \( **R3**\). Traditionally, this period has been regarded as a surgical ‘dark age’, characterised by suffering, death, and dispassion, not to say cruelty: stereotypes evident in both academic scholarship and popular histories. However, Brown’s research conclusively showed that Romantic surgery was far more emotionally complex. It was defined by rich emotional expressivity and self\-reflection, and the relationship between surgeons and their patients was characterised by pity, sympathy, and compassion \( **R2**\). The research also demonstrated that this surgical culture was rooted in the ‘emotional regime’ of Romantic sensibility and was linked to surgeons’ desire for social and professional advancement \( **R4**, **R5**\). Such historical insights challenge the perceptions of the public, and also question widely\-held professional beliefs about the timelessness of professional detachment. The research has had profound implications for current debates about the place of emotion in surgical practice.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 At the outset of the project, the Surgery & Emotion team sought to use their research findings to inform debates about the place of emotion within surgery. The grant from the Wellcome Trust included funds to host workshops in collaboration with the RCS and RCN to inform professional practice, while funds were subsequently secured to run a series of public engagement activities to challenge and complicate popular perceptions of surgery, now and in the past. In particular, the research has complicated notions of surgical detachment and demonstrated that emotions play a vital role in surgery. It has influenced three key areas: healthcare policy, clinical practice and advocacy, and public perception. 

1.  **Promoting and shaping debates within the surgical profession about the importance of emotion and emotional intelligence in collaboration with the RCS and RCN** 

 In collaboration with the RCS and RCN, Brown’s research \( **R1**\- **R5**\) has created space for surgeons and other clinical practitioners to address sensitive issues and discuss the place of emotion in professional practice. In so doing, it has altered the perceptions of, and had a material impact on, the conduct of a range of healthcare practitioners. 

 Surgery & Emotions research into the emotional demands of surgery \( **R2**\) gives a unique view on the need to pay greater attention to the emotional health of surgeons, the emotional burden of the profession, and the emotional relations surgeons have with their patients and with work colleagues involved in surgical procedures and their outcomes. In 2017, the Surgery & Emotions team submitted written evidence to the RCS’ Commission on the Future of Surgery, which had asked for contributions to envision what surgical care would look like 20 years in the future, considering advances in medicine and technology. Brown’s submission argued for the need for better emotional support for surgeons and other healthcare practitioners who work with them. Specifically, it recommended training to promote emotional wellness and resilience, and the use of practices such as Schwartz Rounds, which provide a structured forum where clinical and non\-clinical staff can come together to discuss the emotional and social aspects of working in healthcare. Schwartz Rounds were developed in the USA and are not consistently used in UK healthcare, and usually not at all. In response to the Commission, the RCS produced a Report on the Future of Surgery \(2018\), which set out their ‘compelling and achievable vision of the future of surgery in the UK’ \(see page 4 of **IMP1**\); Brown’s historical evidence proved so compelling that the Surgery & Emotion project was the only non\-clinical submission to be cited in the report. The Commissioners acknowledged the Surgery & Emotion team’s recommendations concerning improved mechanisms to support surgeons emotionally, concluding that, ‘The Commission believes that more support is needed through surgical training and the entire career pathway’ \(see page 77 of **IMP1**\). 

 Following the Commission’s recognition of the importance and potential of the Surgery & Emotions research, Brown and the project team set up accredited Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) training to further advocate for the emotional health of surgeons. In June 2018, a workshop brought together approximately 60 surgeons, historians and other stakeholders to discuss the emotional experience of surgery, past and present. In evaluations of the event, 80% of respondents indicated that they felt historical perspectives on the role of emotions in surgery could shed light on current or future practice. One attendee stated that it had ‘really cemented my belief that what’s happened in the past has an enormous impact on what’s happening today’ and that ‘history can have a strong part to play in where we go from here and how we react/practice’. Asked whether the event had changed their views, a surgeon commented that they ‘now \[saw\] the danger of becoming impersonal and so unprofessional. I also am now aware of the need to care for ourselves not only our patients’ \( **IMP2**\). The event further highlighted the importance of the mental health of surgical practitioners to the RCS, resulting in their production of a special edition of the college’s *Bulletin* which was contributed to by the Surgery and Emotions team, and which reached the college’s 25,000 Fellows and Members \( **IMP3**\). 

 As a result of the collaboration between the Surgery & Emotions team and the RCS, the RCS’s Acting Head of Learning & Access notes how the project has enabled RCS to become more outward\-facing concerning debates about the surgical profession. Surgery & Emotions, she notes, ‘allowed Members and Fellows the chance to see the importance of bringing surgery to the public’s attention outside of a medical setting and how surgeons engaging with the public on this level creates conversations that have an effect on both parties. The work with Dr Brown and his team has further encouraged us to think about how we can open events up to wider audiences… Previously we saw the public, academic and professional audiences as entirely separate’. The collaboration is ongoing: RCS is now ‘in conversation with Dr Brown about how the work of the… project could form the basis of future exhibitions’ in RCS museums \( **IMP3**\). 

 The Surgery & Emotions team have also extended their advocacy for better mental health support to all members of the surgical team, engaging them in discussions about workforce wellbeing. CPD\-accredited training co\-organised by the RCN and Brown attracted 100 different healthcare practitioners, including surgeons, nurses, anaesthetists, junior doctors, and operating department practitioners. Evaluations of the training show how the discussion of historical emotion would shape their practice; one planned to ‘reach out and offer more support’, while another said they would ‘consider the use of role modelling in healthcare’. Three delegates planned to introduce Schwartz Rounds to their hospitals, while many noted they would draw on the learning for training sessions they delivered in their own hospitals \( **IMP2**\). A further result of the event has been its shaping of policy at the RCN in relation to staff well\-being. As their Associate Director of Nursing notes, the ‘historical research… suggest\[ed\] new ways of exploring how to challenge these stereotypes today in order to improve staff wellbeing. The event resulted in the production of a policy document, which has helped to inform the RCN’s long\-term priority work focusing on staffing for safe and effective care'. In the long\-term, the project has ‘helped us to create new partnerships and enhanced RCN’s profile with a public audience’. As she further attests, ‘the impact on the RCN’s work will be ongoing and we value how it will influence our future programmes of work. The Library and Archive team will continue to use the learning to consider myths and stereotypes around emotions in nursing as they develop new exhibitions and events… \[and\] the impact of COVID\-19 on nurses’ \( **IMP4**\). 

1.  **Enhancing clinical practice and enabling and shaping advocacy** 

 Through these collaborations with RCS and RCN, the research has also enabled and shaped advocacy efforts and attempts to shift the culture of surgery in the UK. One Orthopaedic Registrar has commented on how engagement with Surgery & Emotions project events has shaped ongoing work with his own social media campaign designed to begin conversations about negative behaviours in healthcare, \#HammerItOut and \#CutItOut. This campaign is endorsed nationally and internationally by 16 major healthcare associations and colleges \( [http://www.bota.org.uk/hammer\-it\-out/](http://www.bota.org.uk/hammer-it-out/)\). As he reports, ‘Your research… has allowed me to build networks and further finesse the ongoing work I undertake in the culture change landscape’ \( **IMP5**\). Surgery & Emotions has also enabled advocacy: the founder and former\-CEO of The Point of Care Foundation, a London\-based charity that works to humanise healthcare, noted how RCS and RCN events encouraged the organisation to advocate for the introduction of Schartz Rounds to the UK \( **IMP6**\). 

 **The research has also shaped and enhanced clinical practice, particularly in reference to the training of new surgeons.** An Orthopaedic Surgeon who works in surgical education at Imperial College London attests to how the research \( **R1**\- **R5**\) ‘changed how I respond to the needs of my junior team when dealing with loss’. The surgeon notes that the project has changed the way she uses the appraisal process: instead of viewing it as ‘a tiresome administrative exercise’, and now uses it as an opportunity to ‘pause for a while and consider the emotional impact of testing work on an individual and address issues that could end in burnout or contribute to moral harm’ \( **IMP7**\). The project continues to shape clinical practice through its former Engagement Fellow, now the Workforce Policy Manager at the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, who has reported that in her work, she used the project’s research to inform ‘one of my recent projects explor\[ing\] the formation of professional identities in multi\-professional teams’ \( **IMP8**\). 

1.  **Challenging widely\-held stereotypes about surgical culture and identity** 

 The Surgery & Emotion team has also engaged the public in the history of surgery and in discussions about surgery’s place in society, reaching approximately 123,600 members of the public through events and the broadcast media \( **IMP9**\). In March 2019, Brown was involved in BBC Radio 3’s ‘Free Thinking Festival’, using his research \( **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\) to contribute to a panel discussion with a surgeon, a general practitioner and a critical care physician/author on the topic ‘Should Doctors Cry?’ \( **IMP10**\). This programme has been broadcast on Radio 3 several times with listening figures of 93,000. Linked to this event, Brown also featured in a short film made by BBC Ideas entitled ‘Is it OK for doctors to cry?’ which has been viewed over 34,000 times \( **IMP9**\). 

 Complementing these broad engagement strategies, to extend the reach of the research and to support public discourse and understanding, a series of targeted events have simultaneously brought surgeons and the public into dialogue with one another, whilst also contributing to the enrichment of cultural life. Amongst the most significant events were two ‘surgical speed\-meets’ which were funded by a Wellcome Trust public engagement grant \( **G2**\) and took place in London and Manchester in 2019, attracting over 40 attendees \( **IMP9**\). These events enabled surgeons and members of the public to have candid, informal one\-on\-one conversations about how it feels to practise \(and undergo\) surgery and were designed to demystify surgery and challenge stereotypes about surgical detachment. After the event, attendees were more likely to respond to the statement that ‘Surgeons are usually detached’ with the response ‘Strongly disagree’. That the speed\-meets challenged stereotypes about surgeons is further evident in written evaluation. As an example, a member of the public stated that the event had ‘radically changed my view of surgeons’ reflecting that ‘they were all very thoughtful and emotionally engaged’ \( **IMP2**\). 

 The public engagement grant \( **G2**\) also funded a major Museums Late event organised in collaboration with the RCN. The event, which included a presentation by Brown about his research \( **R2, R3, R4, R5**\), provoked debate about the place of emotion in medicine and surgery. Evaluations show the extent to which attendees at the event, mostly composed of young adults, had their ideas and behaviours changed. One wrote that ‘It made me realise that emotions are fundamental to medical practice’ and that ‘I will be more understanding about the demands that medical practitioners face’ \( **IMP2**\). The Associate Director of Nursing reports that the Museums Late event ‘helped us to raise awareness of nursing past and present with a wider public, exploring the way historic stereotypes of nurses impact the way they are viewed and understood today’ and commented on the RCN’s new and ongoing interest in using ‘the learning to consider myths and stereotypes about emotions in nursing’ \( **IMP4**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Producing high\-quality character animation involves a significant amount of time\-consuming manual work, making character animation production difficult and inefficient. Research from Bournemouth University \(BU\) tackled this problem, resulting in an improvement in production practices and economic impact for Humain Ltd, using BU’s newly developed character animation techniques. These newly developed techniques: 

-  reduced the time needed to create a facial rig from several weeks to several minutes, 

-  helped Humain Ltd. attract GBP1,096,000 investments and generate GBP1,153,000 revenue in 3 years, 

-  and helped Humain Ltd. become a world\-leading technology and entertainment leader with high\-quality products and services.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2019, the global animation market was valued approximately USD335,700,000,000 \( [<ins>Market Watch</ins>](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-animation-market-size-study-with-covid-19-impact-by-component-software-and-services-deployment-mode-cloud-and-on-premises-by-type-traditional-animation-2d-vector-based-animation-3d-computer-animation-motion-graphics-and-stop-motion-by-industry-media-and-entertainment-education-retail-healthcare-manufacturing-and-others-and-regional-forecasts-2020-2026-2021-02-26?siteid=bigcharts&dist=bigcharts&tesla=y), 2021\). This demand places significant pressures on animation studios to produce high\-quality virtual characters in a short time scale, which involves tedious and time\-consuming manual work. Since 2008, BU researchers have tackled this problem, leading to: 

-  The development of two new techniques: 

    -  Characteristic curve\-based dynamic skin deformation \[R1\] and, 

    -  Efficient numerical dynamic skin deformation to create a horse animation of 30 frames in less than 0.5 seconds \[R2\]. 

-  A European Commission funded research project \(2018\-2021, EUR535,500\) to develop new techniques \[T1\] and their software tools \[S1\] of partial differential equation\-based geometric modelling, image processing and shape reconstruction \(PDE\-GIR\). 

-  An Innovate UK funded Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) project \(2018\-2020, GBP173,010\) to develop new techniques of facial blendshapes \[R3, R7\]. The completed KTP project was awarded the highest grade of “Outstanding” by the KTP Grading Panel for its achievement in meeting KTP’s objectives. 

 BU’s research findings can be summarised as follows: 

####  Facial rigging tools 

1.  **Hybrid facial rigging tool.** This newly developed tool integrates facial blendshapes and bone\-driven facial animation to create various facial expressions easily and quickly \[R3\]. 

1.  **Automatic correspondences for deformation transfer.** To tackle the problem of deformation transfer in manually specifying correspondences of facial landmarks, this newly developed technique achieves full automation and avoids manual operations \[R3\]. This formed the basis of another Innovate UK funded project led by Humain Ltd. to develop a new technique of immersive hands. 

1.  **Machine learning\-based 3D facial expression production.** This technique combines a 3D face morphable model with machine learning to reuse existing datasets for reducing manual work in producing facial animation from a single image \[awaiting publication\]. 

####  Skin deformation techniques 

1.  **Automatic rigging.** Manually placing a skeleton in a 3D character model involves heavy manual operations. This newly developed technique automates the process and creates an animation skeleton in a few milliseconds \[R4\]. 

1.  **Analytical physics\-based skin deformation.** This technique \[R5\] was developed to tackle the difficulty in implementing the numerical dynamic skin deformation technique \[R2\] and achieve higher efficiency. It obtains the first analytical solution to physics\-based skin deformations to create the animation of a horse model with 10,128 vertices at 205 frames per second \[R5\]. 

####  Character modelling methods 

1.  **Fast character modelling with sketch\-based partial differential equation \(PDE\) surfaces.** To tackle the incapability of sketch\-based modelling in creating detailed 3D models easily and quickly, this project developed a simple, easy\-to\-use, efficient, and sketch\-based character modelling tool for fast creation of detailed character models \[R6\]. 

1.  **Character model creation with ordinary differential equation \(ODE\) based C2 continuous surfaces.** This technique was developed to avoid tedious and time\-consuming manual operations of existing techniques in stitching two separate patches together to achieve the required continuities, significantly reduce data size, and provide more flexible and powerful shape manipulation handles \[R7\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Producing high\-quality character animation involves time\-consuming manual work, making its production difficult and inefficient. Humain Ltd. aims to create the world’s best automated online character creation service through new techniques, to produce high\-quality virtual characters and their animation efficiently. 

 Dr Shaojun Bian was employed via the KTP to develop new techniques \[R3, R7: E1, E3, E4\]. She previously researched automatic rigging and skin deformation \[R2, R4\] as part of the European Commission funded PDE\-GIR project \( [<ins>http://pde\-gir.com/</ins>](http://pde-gir.com/)\). The new techniques developed by the PDE\-GIR project have been applied in Indeform Ltd. \[E3\], disseminated to many audiences through two PDE\-GIR workshops \[E4\], and provided a foundation for the subsequent KTP \[E5\] and resulting impact \[E2, E6\]. 

 As Humain Ltd. highly appraised, “BU development of the facial rigging tools and techniques for skin deformation, machine learning\-based 3D facial expression, fast character modelling with sketch\-based PDE surfaces and automatic rigging has given the company an edge over the competition, enabling the company to use photographic and video input into their process instead of a scan as well as use algorithms” \[E6\]. 

####  Impact on industry practices 

 Before developing the new techniques, getting a 3D virtual character into production required between a few days to a few months. The new techniques \[E1, E2\] enabled Humain Ltd. to automate the transfer of Action Units from their own database to another character, removing the need for 3D modellers, which “reduced the time frame to create complete models with realistic facial expressions from 30 days to a few minutes” \[E2, E6\]. This is a significant time and cost saving to Humain Ltd. 

 As well as saving time, the new techniques have helped to make Humain Ltd.’s workload more streamlined and efficient. Producing high\-quality 3D virtual character requires experts, modellers and animators from different disciplines to work together, and heavy and time\-consuming manual operations are involved in the production process. The new techniques have been integrated into the company’s product offerings, transformed the company’s facial development pipeline from a labour\-intensive process by highly specialized artists to a simple command line interface that everyone in the company can run. According to Humain, this has “enabled \[them\] to develop technology and capability that has moved the company from being purely considered as an outsource vendor to a state\-of\-the\-art R&D partner to world leading technology and entertainment leaders” \[E2, p.6\-8\]. 

 The impact on industry practices is also highlighted by Indeform Ltd.’s comments: the main benefits of PDE\-based modelling Blender plugin \[S1\] application in medical and engineering areas are “Flexibility and ability” and “Speed of predefined models generation”, “it takes seconds to generate new model”, and “This is a huge benefit” \[E3\]. 

####  Impact on innovation 

 Transforming Humain Ltd.’s ways of working has changed its external reputation. As Humain Ltd. stated, “the game\-changer contribution of BU researchers” has enabled the company “to achieve its goals while reducing the time and effort required to create a facial rig, which is a breakthrough which has and will become a huge profit centre for the company as it enables Humain to complete industry leading facial rigs with much fewer resources” \[E6\]. 

 The techniques developed by BU researchers at Humain Ltd. have made it possible for them to “work on cutting edge projects with world\-leading organisations in the technology and entertainment industry, such as Activision and Google, sign contracts to expand our portfolio and services \(e.g. Axis Studios and The Imaginarium\) and obtain further funding to develop our technology which have placed us as a reference in a highly competitive business market” \[E6\]. 

####  Economic impact 

 Humain’s increased competitiveness is demonstrated by the following examples: 

-  Humain Ltd. was asked by leading entertainment organisation HBO to provide the evidence of developing non\-photorealistic \(NPR\) characters. With the new techniques, Humain Ltd. delivered a fully realised NPR character with animation running inside the Unreal Engine, 24 hours later. Humain Ltd. won the USD400,000 contract \[E2, p.8\], beating two other competitors. 

-  The Imaginarium Studios required rigging characters for an innovative television show for a world leading streaming company. Using the developed techniques, Humain Ltd. offered a unique approach to capturing the actors’ movement and won the contract \[E2, p.8\]. 

-  The developed techniques contributed to the successful delivery of a GBP500,000 project to Microsoft \[E2, p.11\]. 

-  The developed techniques served as the basis for a successful application to the Audience of the Future Immersive Technology Investment Accelerator in 2019. The company secured GBP90,000 in equity investment from TechStart NI and GBP210,000 from Innovate UK \[E2, p.6\]. 

-  Over the past 3 years, the company has worked on 16 different projects, generating a revenue of GBP1,153,000 \[E6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Opera’s exclusive use of Received Pronunciation \(RP\) in sung English means that it is often accused of being an ‘elitist’ artform. Salford researchers developed singing techniques using the accents of English speakers not normally heard or seen in classical music and this resulted in the world’s first opera ever written in a Yorkshire accent \(The Arsonists, 2017, with librettist Ian McMillan\). The opera generated awareness in audiences new to opera via media coverage, challenging attitudes to both Yorkshire accents and opera itself. A project in 2020 trained emerging composers in these singing techniques and this generated five new works in Mancunian and Nigerian accents for Psappha, a professional contemporary classical music ensemble, as well as a commission for Ian McMillan to translate Rossini’s Barber of Seville into Yorkshire dialect for the annual Bradford Festival. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The context for the underpinning research was that, at a time of economic austerity, opera’s substantial public funding and conspicuous expenditure had led to accusations of elitism. Calls had emerged for public subsidy to be transferred away from opera. Northern Voices was an Arts Council England funded research and development project which addressed a significant contributing factor to these accusations \- that opera singers are trained to use an accent when singing in English that connotes privilege. 

 Through a combination of workshops and a full\-length opera production, Salford researchers sought to address the following research questions: 

-  What techniques are necessary for other accents in English to be perceived by opera audiences in the sung parts? 

-  What techniques are best for singers who are not speakers of the accent in question to learn a specific accent and pronunciation? 

-  How true is the commonly stated objection to singing in an accent other than Received Pronunciation \(RP\), that it will not be possible to project over the ensemble? 

-  What aspects of the spoken language can, and what aspects must the composer reflect in the rhythms and stresses of musical material to achieve an audible Yorkshire accent? 

 Phase One of the project consisted of a series of five workshops, involving singer Omar Ibrahim, who premiered the role of the ‘Northern Shepherd’ in Harrison Birtwistle’s 1986 chamber opera Yan Tan Tethera; Conrad Nelson, Director of Northern Broadsides Theatre Company; singers Zoe Milton Brown, Richard Strivens, Nick Sales, Tom Eaglen, and Sarah Helsby Hughes, poet Ian McMillan and sociolinguist Phillip Tipton. The project was funded by Arts Council England and took place between July 2014 and March 2015. In Phase Two a full\-length opera in a Yorkshire accent was rehearsed and performed between October and November 2017 **\[3.1\]**. 

 The techniques we developed can be summarised as follows: 

 Performing techniques: 

-  Diphthongs \- whereas in conventional training the second part of the diphthong comes very late in the sung vowel, we brought it forward 

-  Voiced Consonants \- unlike conventional training we lengthened the voiced consonant to allow for a short vowel on a long note 

-  Vowel Modification – this technique facilitates control in high notes, particularly in soprano voices. It obscures the specific quality of vowels in Yorkshire accented English, so we abandoned it, even where this resulted in an ‘ugly’ tone. 

 Composing techniques: 

-  The rhythm of the spoken voice, in particular short and long vowels, were reflected precisely in text setting, based on an audio recording of the poet’s speaking voice, as in Hungarian and Finnish settings 

-  Setting material lower in range for the key vowels which identify the accent gave the singer more control over their accuracy. 

 In interview with the BBC’s Arts Correspondent David Sillito, soprano Sarah Helsby Hughes commented on vowel length: 

 DS: *So all the sounds are…\[i.e. in words like ‘productivity’\] …really short ends – is that difficult for singing?* 

 SHH: *No, it’s better because there’s not so much of a diphthong on the end. In that way it’s closer to Italian.* 

 Our findings were that: 

-  It is possible to project the operatic voice over a large ensemble in a Yorkshire accent 

-  Yorkshire is easier to sing than RP 

-  Accents in English are so distinct that they need to be localised to the speaking voice of the librettist 

-  The use of International Phonetic Alphabet transcription, combined with recordings of the poet’s own voice, and accent coaching enabled accents to be heard 

-  Relative length of vowel is as important as particular vowel quality 

-  It is the composer’s task as much as the performer’s to create the vocal impression of a particular accent in spoken and sung English. 

 These findings were disseminated through a series of blog posts, videos and a paper at the ‘Grim up North’ conference at the University of Hull in September 2017 **\[3.2\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 *The Arsonists* represent people from sections of society who are often not seen on the opera stage, using accents as close as possible to their speaking voices. This challenged conventional perceptions of opera as elitist. The opera, and the research and development phase that led to it **\[3.1, 3.2\]**, did this by generating greater public awareness of opera, class and northern identity as well as addressing new audiences for the artform. This subsequently led to the training of composers, librettists and singers in the techniques developed from the research and resulted in the commissioning of new work using non\-standard accents in contemporary classical music and the translating of existing opera texts into Yorkshire dialect. 

 **4.1. Generating public awareness of opera, class and northern identity and addressing new audiences for the artform** 

 *The Arsonists* garnered considerable media attention following its premiere in 2017, and brought the artform to new audiences, in particular younger demographics \(for example, via extracts on  [Buzzfeed](https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedUKNews/videos/1074740552662411/) \(200,000 followers\)\) and audiences beyond the traditional opera community, through appearances on <ins>BBC Look North</ins>, the <ins>Manchester Evening News</ins> video site, and in the national  [print media](https://alanwilliams123.wordpress.com/projects/the-arsonists/press-and-media-coverage/). <ins>The Mirror</ins>, for example, released an article headlined ‘ *It's Nessun t'Dorma\! First Yorkshire opera to challenge posh image of art form by featuring thick Northern accents’* and described its purpose as *‘removing the perception of opera being about posh people and for posh people’* **\[5.1\]**. 

 Ian McMillan, poet and librettist, also known as the ‘Bard of Barnsley’, speaking to the Manchester Evening News in November 2017, stated *‘It's been an absolute joy to experience my words being brought to life by Alan Williams's amazing music and this project has reinforced my idea that new writing and music can be at the heart of what a university does in the local and wider community. Here's to the next collaboration\!’* **\[5.2\]**. 

 Its impact even extended to a <ins>BBC Yorkshire</ins> broadcaster singing a report live on Look North in response to the Northern Opera idea **\[5.3\]**. While the execution, described by <ins>The Sun</ins> as a *‘bizarre operatic sing\-along live on air’,* may have lacked professional finesse, the broadcaster’s enthusiasm communicated itself to a broad audience \(viewing figures approximately 900,000\) **\[5.3\]**. Responses to this and other media coverage on Twitter showed that awareness of opera was being changed by the project, with one follower tweeting: ‘ *Oh wow, this changes everything \- Opera in a northern accent*’ **\[5.4\]**. 

 The research continues to resonate in popular and mainstream culture and was, for example, the subject of a question in BBC Radio 4’s music quiz  [*Counterpoint*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bgbzjg) \(27 August 2018\). It was also discussed by popular science writer and Senior Editor at New Scientist, Rowan Hooper, in his 2018 book <ins>‘</ins><ins> *Superhuman: Life at the Extremes of Mental and Physical Ability</ins><ins>’*</ins> **\[5.5\]**. On singing, Hooper stated that ‘ *The short vowel sounds of the north of England are better \(which is why the composer Alan Williams, from Salford University, has created an opera designed for the northern accent\)’* **\[5.5\]**. 

 Interest around the opera was also picked up by the tourism industry, with <ins>Welcome to Yorkshire</ins> using it as part of its cultural offer: its 2018 Guide made reference to homegrown poet Ian McMillan in a section on Yorkshire’s literary history, stating that he ‘ *recently wrote the libretto to The Arsonists, the world’s first opera written in a South Yorkshire dialect’* **\[5.6\]**. 

 In 2019 and 2020 additional in\-person and online screenings of *The Arsonists* were held as a further means of making the artform accessible to a new audience. Comments from audience members, many with little experience of opera, demonstrated the way in which this unique opera offering has transformed their views: 

  

 ‘*It has made me realise that operas can be about people who I’ll be able to relate to’* 

 ‘*I enjoyed that the characters seemed very “working class” as opposed to more traditional characters in opera, which made the narrative easier to follow*’ 

 ‘*With the language and accent being personally relatable to me, I found that I was easily engaged*’ 

 *‘It definitely brought a new perception to me, and now what I think opera is/can be, instead of me having the stereotypical view that opera is just for the wealthier people within society and only touches on relatable subjects to them. However, I am more open to the idea that opera isn’t necessarily just that’* **\[5.7\]**. 

 Two\-thirds of respondents confirmed that viewing the opera had made it more likely that they would attend similar performances in the future **\[5.7\]**. 

 **4.2. Training professionals in new techniques and commissioning new works in non\-standard English** 

 Between March and June 2020, an Arts Council England funded project \(GBP12,695\) with leading UK contemporary music ensemble <ins>Psappha</ins> used the same techniques applied in *The Arsonists* with four emerging professional composers in five half\-day workshops. The composers worked with two poets to set texts to be sung in the poets’ own performing accents, this time in the context of contemporary classical music rather than chamber opera. Two new accents and one related language were set as part of this project: Nigerian accented English and Nigerian Pidgin \(considered a discreet language\); and the English poet’s Mancunian accent **\[5.8\]**. 

 A composer of contemporary classical music was one of those commissioned to write a piece of music set to the poetry. He found it an enlightening experience, commenting that: ‘ *During the process I’ve learnt a huge amount about how to foreground language in my music and how to communicate a sense of ‘place’ to the listener’* **\[5.8\]**. 

 The four songs commissioned by Psappha from these emerging composers are now programmed for their  [world\-premiere performances in March 2021](https://www.psappha.com/event/in-focus-music-for-cimbalom/?psa_nrdr=1) and have reached their final form. One of the composers confirmed that he is *‘confident that this research will spur an interest in others to further develop the artistic potential of setting regional accents to classical music’* **\[5.8\]**. 

 Further to this, <ins>Bradford Festival</ins> and <ins>Freedom Studios</ins> commissioned Ian McMillan to write a new translation in Yorkshire dialect of Rossini’s opera *The Barber of Seville*: two arias were performed from the work\-in\-progress in October 2019 and the final piece was due to be performed at the Festival in July 2020 but was postponed because of the COVID\-19 pandemic **\[5.9\]** *.* In response to his commission, McMillan commented: ‘ *I’ve often spoken about the ways that different accents are regarded in the UK and I think that this project shows that work like The Arsonists is starting to change attitudes’*. He added: ‘ *This work wouldn’t have been commissioned if it hadn’t been for The Arsonists and the research led by Alan and his colleague Phillip Tipton’* **\[5.10\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 EvoFIT is a system of software and procedures that helps police to identify suspects of serious crimes, such as rape and assault. Our research has resulted in a system that is easy to use and highly effective, with identification rates around 60 to 70% compared to 5% for traditional systems like E\-fit. During the REF period, EvoFIT has been used by 26 police forces in 11 countries for over 2,500 investigations, assisting in the identification and arrest of an estimated 1,500 serious offenders, including a murderer. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 If you are a victim or witness of crime, the police may ask you to create a ‘composite’ of the perpetrator’s face. This is a difficult task, but we have applied our understanding of the psychology of human face recognition to create a system to make it easier and more accurate. EvoFIT is the culmination of 25 years of funded research, initiated at Stirling and more recently in close collaboration with the University of Central Lancashire \(UCLan\). It had its origins in Hancock’s work at Stirling in the 1990s \(see output **R1**\), which resulted in a studentship for Charlie Frowd. After 2000, it was funded by a link grant \(DTI/EPSRC\) and a further EPSRC grant \(2005\-7\). Since then, research has continued at Stirling and at UCLan, where Frowd moved in 2007, with the aid of small development grants, student project work and income from the system. The research has been collaborative, principally between Hancock and Frowd but involving numerous other researchers, including police practitioners. 

 Beyond developing the software, we have investigated the whole process of composite production, from interviewing the witness to presenting the final image. We developed a novel ‘holistic cognitive interview’ that invited witnesses to consider the overall appearance of the face; we showed an advantage for asking witnesses to focus on internal features of the face, which are most important for familiar face recognition; and demonstrated that presenting the complete composites as animated caricatures promotes recognition. A key part of our methodology is to evaluate composite systems in a way that emulates, so far as possible, the usage by police, with a realistic delay before making the composites. We were thus able to determine that combining techniques produces an additive improvement in final recognition rates \( **R2**\). Our extensive research enabled us to perform our own meta\-analysis, to identify what aspects are most important across studies. This confirmed the benefit of using internal features and the holistic\-cognitive interview \( **R3**\). 

 Our research has continued to refine our understanding of each stage of the process. During the initial interview, we now ask witnesses to concentrate on the eye region, which is known to be the critical area for familiar face recognition \( **R4**\). During composite construction, it is possible for witnesses to become confused and lose their memory of the target face. We have shown that focussed breathing exercises significantly improve the final composites \( **R5**\). Finally, we have developed methods for adding ‘paraphernalia’ such as beards, hats and sunglasses to the final composites, which shows what the suspect might look like when thus disguised \( **R6**\) \(see example usage, below\). We were able to show that this achieves more than simply recreating the appearance of the suspect: covering up areas that were not seen by the witness prevents someone who is attempting to identify the composite from being misled by inaccurate information.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 **Summary** 

 This case study details effective systems and procedures for the police to identity offenders of mainly serious crime. The primary impact is its use in over 2,500 investigations across the UK and 10 other countries. This has been achieved through: 

1.  the EvoFIT facial\-composite system 

1.  enhanced interview techniques developed specifically for facial\-composite construction \(detailed recall of environment, holistic\-cognitive interview\), and 

1.  post\-production techniques \(stretched composite, hat\-sunglasses presentation\) for enhancing recognition of finished composites by police officers and members of the public. 

 **Overview** 

 EvoFIT was conceived from the outset as a system to be used by police. We consulted police composite operators early in the development; they told us our image quality was too good and might confuse people into thinking it was an actual photograph. Cycles of development resulted in a first operational use in 2009 for a case of indecent assault; the composite led directly to the identification and confession of the perpetrator. EvoFIT is now deployed in 26 police forces \( **S1**\), comprising 17 of the 43 \(40%\) constabularies in England and Wales, plus Police Scotland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. This figure includes 14 new users gained since 2013. In the UK it is used by police forces in Essex, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, South Wales, Staffordshire, Dyfed Powys, Cheshire and Wiltshire. Beyond the UK, it is now used across Ireland and has been used for case work in Boston Police Department, Austria, Czech Republic, France and an Israeli embassy. In 2020 it was trialled in Costa Rica. The Irish police were so pleased with their new system that they made a video about it \( **S3**\). Thirty\-eight five\-year software licenses, totalling 190 years, have been purchased, and 117 police officers / staff have completed \(usually\) five\-day practitioner training. Total income to the project to December 2020 is GBP343,600. 

 A recent development has been the production of an online version of EvoFIT that will permit access from anywhere with web access. The system is being trialled by Boston Police Department; early results are positive with indications that it will save time and therefore money. It has been authorised for use in one UK police force, with another in progress. 

 To achieve the highest identification of offenders, training courses have incorporated best procedures and software emerging from underpinning research. Each development is novel \(not used previously in policing\) and involved a change of practice: stretched view \(published 2013 but introduced in 2015\), evolve with attention to eye region \(2016\), ignore facial width \(2016\), detailed recall of \(environment\) crime scene \(2017\), enhanced \(eye\-region\) Holistic\-Cognitive Interview \(2018\) and hat\-sunglasses secondary exhibit \( **R6**\) \(2019\). These milestones in research were initially introduced for police to trial to elicit feedback, and then released as a procedural or software enhancement during annual workshops attended by trained police practitioners. Users report good uptake of techniques relating to underpinning research during this REF cycle: detailed recall of environment \(80% of all composites constructed\), Holistic\-Cognitive Interview \(89%\) and attentional focus to eye region \(50%\). See the example usage \(below\) for a recent illustration of the ability to add hats, beards, and sunglasses. 

 **Detailed assessment** 

 In an assessment of impact completed by trained police practitioners \( **S2a**, **S2b**\), covering the period from September 2013 to December 2019, 2,802 witnesses and victims of crime constructed an EvoFIT composite. Based on the mean number of composites constructed by police forces per month, an additional estimated 709 composites were likely to have been created by July 2020, for a total of 3,149 constructed from September 2013 to July 2020. Police field trials \( **S4**\) indicate an arrest rate of 60%, which translates to identification of 1,889 suspects, with 29% \(548\) leading to conviction. For comparison, identification rates from the traditional ‘E\-fit’ system are about 5% \( **S6**\). EvoFIT composites were requested by 1,657 different police investigators and were circulated internally to an estimated minimum cumulative total of 18,700,000 police staff \(based on the mean circulation rate per force, see **S2a**\). The assessment also revealed that, in addition to police\-managed websites, investigators have published EvoFITs in 33 different media outlets. We further analysed a sample of the first 150 police appeals for information returned on the Internet using search terms such as “evofit appeal” and found EvoFIT composites were constructed in a wide range of serious crimes. A total of 250 offenders were sought by 17 police forces for serious offences including murder, rape, \(sexual\) assault, \(attempted\) child abduction, stabbing, robbery, and burglary. Asked for feedback from victims, one officer replied, “Even though it was initially explained that the composite is more like a drawing, at the end the victim exclaimed 'It's him\!' \(she thought that the composite is the real photo of the offender\)” \( **S2b**\). 

 **Public engagement** 

 In addition to the formally assessed impact described above, we have undertaken various forms of public engagement to inform a wider audience of the technology. With funding from EPSRC \(rated ‘Tending to outstanding’\) we installed an interactive exhibit at the Dundee Science Centre; further funding from the British Psychological Society \(BPS\) enabled exhibits for Glasgow Science Centre and ‘We the Curious’ in Bristol. A portable version of this popular exhibit has been used at over 15 science festivals and public events in the UK, including BPS events designed to attract school students to Psychology \( **S6**\). Hancock has talked about the development of EvoFIT, for example at an invited workshop at the University of Reading in 2018 and at a Science Cabaret at Stirling in 2016. The system has featured in TV dramas, such as ‘Spooks’ and ‘The Fall’ \( **S7**\) and featured in a BBC Ideas video about facial composites that has been viewed over 17,000 times since release in May 2020 \( **S9**\). 

 **Example usage** 

 There are numerous examples where EvoFIT led to identification of offenders \(e.g., **S4**, **S5**, **S8**\).  One notable case, which we cannot illustrate for legal reasons, identified a child sex offender from the 20\-year\-old memory of the victim. The system also produced an image of a man sought for rape in Dublin that was described by the Irish police as ‘almost perfect’; the man was subsequently found, arrested and charged \( **S5**\). Because of the problems of disguise \( **R6**\), EvoFIT was deployed in a widely advertised investigation by Dyfed Powys in 2018 to locate murder suspect Wayne Tidy. An EvoFIT of Tidy was created from the police photograph \(Fig. 1, far left\) with a range of disguises \(Fig. 1, middle four images\); Dyfed Powys reported these were very helpful \( **S8**\) when briefing officers on his likely appearance: on arrest \(Fig. 1, far right\), he had grown a beard similar to the centre depiction.

 **Conclusion** 

 Our research has revolutionised the production and presentation of facial composites, resulting in many solved cases, reduced effort for the police and a less stressful experience for the witness/victim. While we can assess usage, it is much harder to quantify the effect on public perceptions of safety or the mental state of victims. However, the likely effect on the recovery of a rape victim whose composite directly leads to the identification and capture of her attacker feels like the most important impact of all.

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Imperial College researchers have taken bronchoscopic lung volume reduction techniques for people with severe emphysema from proof\-of\-concept, through first\-in\-man case series and randomised controlled trials demonstrating clinically significant improvements in lung function, breathlessness, exercise capacity, quality of life and survival, to an established place in both NICE and international guidelines for COPD management. The team established a national register and identified inequalities of access, which, combined with evidence of effectiveness and value, led to approval for Specialist Commissioning by NHS England in November 2020, allowing treatment for thousands of breathless and disabled COPD patients with otherwise irreversible disease.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 There are 1,300,000 people with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \(COPD\) in the UK. In selected patients with lung hyperinflation due to emphysema, surgical removal of the worst affected area of lung reduces gas trapping and allows the relatively healthy areas of lung to function more effectively. Around 1% of COPD patients are suitable to benefit from this technique. Lung volume surgery involves resecting target lung – it is effective, but little used because of concerns over morbidity and cost. 

 Researchers at Imperial College London have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of an alternative approach, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction, as a treatment for emphysema through case series, physiological studies and definitive randomised controlled trials. 

 Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction is achieved by placing endobronchial valves into the airways supplying the target lobe of lung. These allow air to leave but not enter, causing the target lobe to collapse and facilitating safe lung volume reduction. The approach is less invasive than surgery and can be more widely applied with less risk of morbidity and mortality with a reduction in usage of healthcare resources. 

 The Imperial College team conducted the first randomised controlled trial \(RCT\) of lung volume reduction surgery \(LVRS\) which proved the concept that lung volume reduction for people with emphysema improved breathlessness, quality of life and exercise capacity \(1\). The researchers then demonstrated, in the first case series describing the use of endobronchial valves for lung volume reduction, that they could be placed safely and that the procedure improved lung function \(2\). 

 Further work in clarifying the importance of achieving lobar occlusion demonstrated that endobronchial valves reduced dynamic hyperinflation during exercise and that this was associated with a substantial improvement in exercise capacity, particularly in individuals where radiological atelectasis \(where the target area of lung collapses down\) was demonstrated \(3\). The team established the importance of careful patient selection \- if emphysema has broken down the barriers between lobes, collateral ventilation occurs, and valve placement is ineffective because air can still get into the target lobe from adjacent lung. 

 The team of researchers also demonstrated a survival benefit with successful valve placement \(4\), which is important given the absence of treatments that alter the natural history of COPD. They also established the beneficial impact of lung volume reduction \(a\) in improving oxygen kinetics because lung hyperinflation impedes cardiac function and \(b\) on ventilatory synchrony, using the novel, non\-invasive optoelectronic plethysmography technique. 

  

 The Imperial College team went on to perform the first double\-blind BeLieVeR\-HIFi RCT of valve placement, funded by the NIHR\-MRC EME programme \(5\), and to lead the TRANSFORM multicentre RCT \(6\). These studies confirmed clinically significant benefits in quality of life, breathlessness, lung function and exercise capacity. 

 The work of these researchers within the field of advanced therapies for emphysema have also demonstrated that LVRS can be conducted more safely in modern practice and that access to lung volume reduction techniques is highly inequitable, underling the importance of the decision of NHS England \(NHSE\) to support specialist commissioning.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 COPD, the third leading cause of death globally after cardiovascular disease and cancer is a combination of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. In emphysema, the alveolar walls and small airways are destroyed, causing the lung tissue to become baggy and trap air. This gas trapping increases the work of breathing, restricts vital capacity and cardiac function and manifests as disabling breathlessness, impaired ability to do physical activity, reduced capacity to withstand acute exacerbations of the condition and premature death. Inhaled medication can relieve symptoms but does not alter the natural history of the disease and lung hyperinflation has been an intractable problem. 

 There are an estimated 16,000 people in the UK and 660,000 in Europe, who might be eligible for a lung volume reduction procedure, equating to approximately 1% of people with COPD. These procedures, indicated in patients with severe COPD who are highly symptomatic, improve breathlessness, exercise capacity and quality of life, as well as prolonging survival in a condition that is otherwise progressive and relentless. The scale of benefit with lung volume reduction is dramatic and typically far exceeds those seen with inhaled medications. 

  

 Initial case series investigations by the Imperial team generated a body of work on the physiological mechanisms and data on mortality benefit from successful valve placement \- previously the only other interventions shown to improve survival in COPD were smoking cessation and supplemental oxygen in individuals with respiratory failure. 

  

 This led to funding of the BeLieVeR\-HIFi trial, the first device study supported by the NIHR\-MRC EME programme. The results of this RCT and the individual patient meta\-analysis performed by the Imperial team, combined with data from the Dutch STELVIO trial, informed a Cochrane review \[ **A**\]. Importantly the improvements in quality of life seen were double that observed with inhaled medication. Collectively this formed the evidence base on which the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) health technology appraisal \[IPG600\] approved the use of endobronchial valve placement within the NHS in 2017 \[ **B**\]. These data also informed international guidelines and clinical practice, with their inclusion in the international GOLD COPD guidelines. 

  

 These data, together with that from the Imperial\-led multi\-centre TRANSFORM trial contributed to the NICE COPD guideline committee making a clear recommendation that endobronchial valve therapy should be offered to appropriately selected patients in 2018 \(NG115 recommendation 1.2.88\) \[ **C**\]. The decision was supported by data estimating the cost per quality\-adjusted life years of endobronchial valve placement at approximately £22,500, putting it within an acceptable range for NICE \[ **D**\]. 

 This evidence of efficacy together with data gathered on inequity of access to the procedures led NHSE to approve endobronchial valve placement for Specialist Commissioning \(November 2020\) so that all patients within the NHS who are suitable should be able to access it \[ **E**\]. 

 Data from the UKLVR registry show that our work has led to 14 centres performing LVR procedures in the UK with around 500 lung volume reduction procedures performed since 2017. The Specialist Commissioning with associated funding and support for referral pathways, will lead to a substantial further increase in patient access and benefit. 

 Endobronchial valve placement is also now recognised in international guidelines for the management of COPD \(e.g. the GOLD guidelines 2020, p63, “endobronchial valve placement shows comparable benefits to LVRS but with fewer complications”\), meaning that the impact has been global \[ **F**\]. According to the website of one valve manufacturer >19,000 emphysema patients worldwide have already undergone an endobronchial valve placement procedure using their product \[ **G**\]. Another manufacturer, Olympus, estimates that globally over 11,000 patients have been treated using their valve product \[ **H**\]. 

 The UK Taskforce for Lung Health states that lung volume reduction procedures remain an underused therapy. Newer and less invasive lung volume reduction technologies, such as valves, broaden the pool of eligible people to as many as 16,300 people in England who could benefit from such a procedure \[ **I**\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor **Bochmann’s** research at UEA has provided an understanding of the mechanism of olefin polymerisation that has had a sustained and significant **economic impact** throughout this impact period. The industrial uptake by, for example, the petrochemical sector of new activator systems and improvement in catalyst performance have underpinned the development of numerous commercially viable polyolefin products \(e.g. used in the automotive, luggage, and food packaging industries\) with sales equating to USD500,000,000. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Between 2000 and 2016, the research group of **Bochmann** carried out a series of research programmes into the activation chemistry and mechanisms of single\-site catalysts for olefin polymerisation, mainly metallocenes. This research was undertaken in collaboration with industrial partners and with industrial funding, thus maximising the opportunity for knowledge transfer to the manufacturing industry throughout the period. The research can be described under the following broad headings: 

 **Weakly Coordinating Anions \(WCA\) \(References 1 & 2\):** Early work on the identification and spectroscopic characterisation of the active species of molecular olefin polymerisation catalysts was followed by the development of activators that led to ultra\-active catalysts of a type that are presently used in industrial solution phase processes. This included the development of “super\-weakly coordinating” anions for generating highly active soluble catalysts. 

 **Trityl Effect \(Reference 3\):** From 2000\-2007 studies on polymerisation kinetics, the solution dynamics and on aggregation phenomena of metallocene catalysts led to the discovery of the “trityl effect”, which can increase the activity of metallocene catalysts by up to an order of magnitude without the need for expensive modification of the metallocene component. 

 **Trimethylaluminium and Hafnium Catalysis \(References 4 & 5\):** Research into the role of trimethylaluminium \(TMA\) in polymerisation catalysis included the first identification of TMA association equilibria and their influence on catalyst activity in zirconocene and hafnocene polymerisation catalysts. Hafnium\-based catalysts are now accepted for polyolefins produced for food packaging. 

 **Cationic Polymerisation and Butyl Rubber Production \(Reference 6\):** In collaboration with Bayer Leverkusen \(Germany\) and Lanxess Inc. \(Canada\) \(1995\-2008\), **Bochmann** developed an alternative to the current process for producing butyl rubber, originally developed before WWII, which requires extremely low operating temperatures \(\-100 °C\) and consequently high energy costs. Using his weakly coordinating anion chemistry, **Bochmann** was able to provide a more energy\-friendly alternative which yields industry\-standard polymers at \-30 °C.

 4. Details of the impact 

 Despite a general move away from single\-use plastics, the need for polymers continues, with global polyolefin production having risen from 25,600,000 tonnes in 1983 to over 180,000,000 tonnes forecast for 2022. The global polyolefin market is expected to gross USD300,000,000,000 at the end of the 2022 and to grow at approximately 7% p.a. from 2016 to 2022 \[ **corroborating source A**\]. Since polyolefins are thermoplastics, they are in principle easily recyclable. Research at UEA focussed on so\-called “single\-site” polymerisation catalysts \(i.e., catalysts based on well\-defined molecules\) and this market sector shows an annual growth rate of more than 10% p.a. 

 A key route to economic impact for the UEA research on olefin polymerisation catalysis continues to be through industry funded IPR protection. Within the butyl rubber polymerisation area, UEA research has resulted in 5 world\-wide ‘patent families’ each containing 5\-7 filings and naming UEA academics as the inventors \[ **corroborating source B**\]. These patents were all financed and continue to be maintained by the industrial partner. 

 The specific uptake of UEA discoveries within the industrial sector remains a matter of commercial secrecy. Statements from key industrial partners, DSM and Sabic, first obtained for REF 2014 and updated for REF2021 \[ **corroborating sources C and D**\], underline the continued importance of the UEA research. 

 DSM is a Dutch\-based global life sciences and materials company with a wide range of products including ultra\-high molecular weight polyethylene \(UHMwPE\). DSM’s production of this material is reliant upon the **trityl effect** discovered by UEA. This material has applications such as knee implants and high\-tensile strength fibres \(Dyneema® used for nets and ropes for the commercial fishing / shipping industry, and personal ballistic protection\). Thus, UEA discoveries are underpinning secondary impact for society in areas of health, productivity and defence. In 2017 DSM had net sales figures of EUR8,600,000,000. 

 UEA research on the **trityl effect** was instrumental in the development of commercially viable polyolefin products at DSM, as shown by the following statement from the Principal Scientist \(Polymer and Catalysis\) at DSM: 

 ‘*If I was asked to be specific on a particular theme that has had industrial significance and that can be easily linked to $$$ then his \[Professor Bochmann’s\] work on the ‘trityl effect’ would stand out. This work has long been regarded as a step change in our knowledge and has led to the commercial success of a family of polyolefin products that only became commercially viable by the addition of an extra equivalent of ‘co\-catalyst’ that led to a 3\-4 fold increase in activity and a 2.5 fold decrease in catalyst cost per ton of polymer. Through this atom efficiency, products became economically attractive to produce. ….their sales equate to a 500M USD business.*’ 

 ‘*The ‘trityl effect’, insight into MAO, C\-H activation work and the mechanistic review papers have aided the development of commercial homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts.*’ 

 \[ **corroborating source C**\] 

 Sabic, a Global Top 10 petrochemical companies based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, reported 2017 total sales of GBP31,000,000,000. In Europe, Sabic is a major producer of plastics and chemicals with approximately 6,300 employees. Sabic\-Europe operates 13 petrochemical production sites, including a site at Geleen in The Netherlands which produces large volumes of polyethylene \(940kt per annum\), and polypropylene \(620kt per annum\). These materials, used in the automotive, luggage, and food packaging industries, are produced by Sabic using weakly coordinating anion discoveries made by UEA. 

 A supporting statement from the Chief Scientist at Sabic shows the continued importance of UEA research on **WCA** to the operation of the petrochemical plant at Geleen: 

 ‘*To the best of my knowledge, almost all low pressure/high temperature solution processes make use of such WCA’s as discrete activators. It is especially in this important area where Professor Bochmann and his co\-workers have played a major role in the discovery, fundamental understanding and subsequent further development of boron containing WCA’s as activators for polyolefins that allowed commercialization of this ground breaking technology.’* 

 \[textredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextreaactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextreaactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredactedtextredacted 

 *‘In 2015, …we started a one\-year bilateral collaboration with him …, enabling our company to commercialize new polyolefinic materials using the catalyst system studied in this collaboration.’* 

 \[ **corroborating source D**\] 

 The packaging market accounts for nearly one third of all Sabic\-Europe’s polymer sales within Europe. For the production of food packaging materials, it is crucial that all polymers comply with EU Plastics Regulations, including the catalysts. The economic relevance of **hafnium\-based polyolefin catalysts** is illustrated by the admission of hafnium containing polyolefins to the EU’s positive list for substances allowed in Food Contact Applications for polyolefins. 

 UEA research on **hafnium catalysis** has been important within such polymer production, as corroborated by the statement from the Chief Scientist at Sabic: 

 ‘*The commercial relevance of hafnium was not very well recognized because of the generally encountered low productivity. For this, pioneering publications on the performance of hafnium\-based polyolefin catalysts by Professor Bochmann’s group were and still are leading references and inspiration sources for the research efforts on hafnium.’* 

 *‘Leading companies like Dow Exxonmobil, NOVA Chemicals and Mitsui have commercialized similar high temperature solution technologies, including plants in Europe, the US and South East Asia.*’

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In the current REF cycle, Dr Mahon has worked extensively as a researcher, curator and curatorial advisor with world\-leading art museums to bring about a fundamental transformation in attitudes to modern art – especially Surrealism – by including the work of women artists, which were previously neglected or ignored. This has led to more museum exhibitions of women artists; the elevation of women artists in the public eye; the bringing of Surrealism to new, diverse audiences; a significant increase in the market value of women artists; and the long overdue discovery and recognition of women artists by art critics, art collectors, and government officials responsible for the arts. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Mahon’s work for these exhibitions was informed by her research and publications on gender, sexuality, and modern art over the past twenty years, resulting in three monographs, one co\-authored book, one edited catalogue, and thirty\-nine essays and journal articles, of which one monograph, the catalogue, and thirteen essays and articles were produced in the current REF cycle. Mahon’s work on this research theme has most recently culminated in her monograph *The Marquis de Sade and the Avant\-Garde* \(2020\) \[R1\], which documents and analyses the ways in which Sade's radical rethinking of female sexuality and libertinage inspired many female Surrealists and their questioning of patriarchy in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. It includes a chapter on Fini’s illustrations for Sade’s *Juliette* \(1944\) and etchings for the erotic novel *Histoire d’O* \(1962\), material which was included in the exhibition *Leonor Fini: Theatre of desire 1930\-1990* held at the Museum of Sex \(MoSEX\) in New York in 2018\-2019 because of Mahon’s input as chief advisor to that exhibition. 

 The questioning of patriarchy and the expression of female sexuality in modern art were also key themes in Mahon’s research and publication of two of the four essays in the catalogue for the exhibition *Dorothea Tanning: Behind the door, another invisible door* at the Reina Sofia Museum, Madrid \(3 Oct. 2018\-6 Jan. 2019\) and the Tate Modern, London \(28 Feb.\-9 June, 2019\) \[R2\]. Mahon also edited the catalogue, published in Spanish and English editions, as a whole. The first of her two essays, ‘Dorothea Tanning: Behind the door, another invisible door’, examined the door motif as a talisman for space and sexuality as explored in many media across Tanning’s seventy year career. Her second essay, ‘Life is something else: Dorothea Tanning’s *Hôtel du Pavot, Chambre 202*’, offered the first scholarly analysis of Tanning’s soft sculptures and installation *Poppy Hotel, Room 202* \(1970\-73\), drawing on unpublished archival material and interviews. This research led Mahon to locate and inventory all Tanning’s previously\-unknown and never\-displayed hand\-crafted soft sculptures, fourteen of which she arranged to have removed from storage for exhibition. 

 Mahon’s interest in avant\-garde sculpture and its subversive play with both Freudian and consumer fetishism also informed her analysis of the avant\-garde’s turn to the hand\-crafted doll and ready\-made mannequin in her essay ‘The Assembly Line Goddess: Modern art and the mannequin’, a 10,000 word essay in the catalogue of the exhibition *Silent Partners: Artist and mannequin from function to fetish* \(Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, 14 Oct. 2014\-25 Jan. 2015, and Musée Bourdelle, Paris, 1 April\-12 July 2015\) \[R6\]. This theme was further developed in her analysis of Dada, Surrealist and Contemporary artists’ uncanny use of the domestic object and space in ‘Gender Politics and the Home: Place of intimacy’, a 4,000 word essay in the catalogue of the exhibition *No Place Like Home* \(The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 25 Feb. 2017\-19 Aug. 2017\) \[R4\]. 

 In ‘The domestic as erotic rite in the art of Carolee Schneemann’, a 9,000 word essay in the *Oxford Art Journal*, 2017 \[R3\], Mahon explored the domestic in Schneemann’s film and performances, drawing on interviews she carried out with the artist. Thanks to Mahon’s discussions with the curatorial team, Schneemann was included in the major exhibition *Sexology and the artistic avant\-garde* \(Wellcome Trust, London, 20 Nov. 2014\-20 Sept. 2015\) for which Mahon wrote a 6,500 word catalogue essay assessing the use of sexology and taxonomies of difference by the Surrealists, Schneemann and Zanele Muholi \[R5\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Mahon’s work challenges the orthodox history of the avant\-garde, notably Surrealism, which has centred on white male European artists. Women are discussed by the majority of scholars and museums only as muses, lovers, and marginalized presences. High profile public exhibitions and events have raised the status of the work of women artists and have demonstrated how their recognition and inclusion is crucial for the history and appreciation of the aesthetic, socio\-political, and emphatically collective ambitions of the avant\-garde. As a result, new audiences have discovered women artists while museums, collectors, and critics have been catalysed into a newfound appreciation of their art. 

 **Persuading Museums to Exhibit More Women Artists** 

 At the Museum of Sex Mahon brought Fini’s body of erotic art, especially works which challenged sexual hierarchies and gender binaries, to new audiences as well as empowering the typical visitor for this museum – ‘60% female and female\-identifying individuals … looking to find new ways to express their desires or seek information about their own bodies’ \[E4\]. The first museum show of Fini in the US, it was attended by over 150,000 visitors, and named one of the top ten exhibitions of 2018 by *Art News*. This led the Weinstein Gallery to receive ‘more inquiries of acquisition for Leonor Fini’s work than any other artist’ \[E4\]. 

 The Reina Sofia invited Mahon to curate a major Tanning exhibition as part of their commitment to avant\-garde women artists ‘whose voices were silenced by the historical periods in which they lived’ \[E1\]. In press meetings, the Director spoke of the ‘great necessity’ for this overdue Tanning exhibition. The Spanish Minister of Culture and Sport praised the Tanning exhibition for supporting the Reina Sofia’s aim to ‘reformulate and reactivate the legacy of modernity’ \[E2\]. He noted that the Reina Sofia and Tate Modern relied on Mahon’s ‘extensive scholarship’, and he pointed to the collaboration of Mahon, the two museums, and the Spanish government as a ‘model of institutional cooperation’ \[E2\]. The retrospective received 429,000 visitors at the Reina Sofia and made a profit of EUR839,508 \[E1\]. Mahon spearheaded a lively public programme – public curator tours, and interactive workshops for teenagers exploring movement and Tanning’s poetry within the exhibition galleries. 

 At Tate Modern, *Dorothea Tanning* attracted 115,000 visitors, with a significant increase in Tate membership \[E3\]. It was named one of the top ten exhibitions of 2019 in *The Guardian*. \[E5\] 6,503 copies of Mahon’s edited *Dorothea Tanning* catalogue were sold at the Tate and 1,642 at the Reina Sophia \(1,150 in Spanish, 492 in English\). It helped prove the museum’s new commitment to underrepresented women artists. The Director of the Tate Modern testified to Mahon’s ‘acute, intelligent and committed cultural vision’ in bringing one of the first women artist shows to Tate Modern and ensuring ‘a talented and visionary artist who had long been overshadowed by her husband, the surrealist Max Ernst’ was redressed. It enabled five works by Tanning from the Tate collection to be showcased anew and shed ‘fresh light on our understanding of surrealism and pointing to a broader geographical and historical scope of surrealist practice’ \[E3\]. Mahon led two public curator’s tours, a public conversation with Tanning’s niece, Mimi Johnson, and an event on Tanning’s *Family portrait*; all sold out. She made a *TateShots* video on Tanning \(7 mins\) which has received over 290,000 views \[E9, p. 203\]. One viewer commented: ‘This just goes to show how sexist the world is that I didn’t learn about this supremely talented artist back when I was an art major some time ago. Learned all about the usual boys, but not her. Crazy’ \[E9, p. 241\]. 

 **Elevating Women Artists in the Eye of Critics and the Public** 

 Both exhibitions were met with overwhelmingly positive responses in the international press. With *Leonor Fini*, a reviewer in *Artforum* noted ‘Today, MOMA has no paintings by Fini in its collection. It has 283 by Ernst … That this retrospective is held at the Museum of Sex underscores institutional art history’s missed encounter with Fini’s work’ \[E4, p.187\]. *Le Temps* wrote ‘I had never heard of Leonor Fini before I entered the Museum of Sex and I noticed that it was really the first time that I saw the feminine represented in this way by an artist of that time’ \[E4, pp. 1\-2\]. *The Art Newspaper* invited Mahon to do a podcast interview on Fini in Nov. 2018; it has had 6,400 listeners to date. In Nov. 2020, Katy Hessel of *The great women artists* podcast invited Mahon to do a further podcast on Fini. It has had over 10,000 listeners to date \[E6\]. 

 The Tanning retrospective was also perceived by the press and public as ‘rescuing’ an artist from the art historical obscurity to which she had been consigned because of her gender. A review in *El Norte de Castilla* was given the subtitle: ‘The Reina Sofia has claimed the genius of a multi\-talented, original artist excluded from the canon’; while *El País* called Tanning a ‘woman surrealist against patriarchy’ \[E8, pp. 91 and 22\]. *The Guardian* gave it a rare five\-star review, noting ‘it’s easy to give Tanning a crucial place in the canon of feminist art’ \[E9, p. 26\]. *ARTnews* described it as ‘a superb Dorothea Tanning retrospective connected with present \(and surely, future\) controversies over sexism’ \[E9, p. 185\]. Many commentators noted the nature of ‘discovery’ round the exhibition: it was described as a ‘nonstop revelation’ \( *The Observer*\) \[E9, p. 101\], ‘an exciting revelation’ \( *The Brooklyn Rail*\) \[E9, p. 145\], an ‘absolute revelation’ \( *The Arts Desk*\), a ‘revelatory exhibition’ \( *Europhile*\) \[E9, p. 168\] and a ‘feast of surprises’ \( *The Sunday Times*\) \[E9, p. 103\]. The exhibition was featured in specialist dance and fashion publications including *The Dancing Times, Dance International, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Stylist* and a *Whistles* blog \[E9, pp. 30; 197; 75; 99; 130; 109\]. It inspired a fashion shoot in *The Financial Times* – ‘10 ways to dress like a surrealist Artist’ – and even a new hairstyle, invented by the London\-based stylist Daniel Dyer \[E11\]. 

 **Celebrating Difference and Serving Diverse Audiences** 

 Mahon’s exhibitions presented Fini and Tanning as exemplary of the ‘modern woman’, as noted by critics and the public. *Leonor Fini* was hailed in *The* *Art Newspaper* as ‘a joyful exploration of freedom, creativity and gender non\-conformity’. David Noh wrote in *Gay City News*, ‘If and when I die, I would love to be resurrected in a world created by Leonor Fini — a realm where it is the female who is all powerful, holding complete yet salubrious sway over all men, being more nurturing, empathetic, infinitely sagacious, and rather more beauty\-loving than the true weaker sex, exemplified by the treasurable show Leonor Fini: The Theater of Desire’ \[E4, p. 176\]. 

 Tate shared several Instagram posts on the Tanning exhibition, which accrued a collective 233,214 likes and where comments repeatedly featured the words: ‘amazing’, ‘fabulous’, ‘fantastic’, ‘stunning’ ‘inspiring’. One Instagrammer commented: ‘Genuinely one of the best exhibitions I’ve seen. Thank you’. There were private viewings for Brad Pitt and Madonna who publicized the show to her 14,100,000 Instagram followers and credited Tanning with providing inspiration for her most recent incarnation: Madame X \[E12, p. 8\]. Tanning’s depictions of motherhood, in particular, touched visitors. The author of an article in *Oh Comely* magazine said: ‘The first time I saw \[ *Maternity*, 1946\] at Museo Reina Sofia, I felt a deep connection with it and my own internal debate about motherhood’ \[E9, p. 36\], while a piece in *Elephant Magazine* said: ‘At Dorothea Tanning’s exhibition at Tate Modern, it comes as a great relief to see motherhood depicted in nightmarish glory … Seeing this kind of depiction hanging in a major museum is vital’ \[E9, p. 183\]. An article on the healing effect of art on mental health in *Dazed* cited the Tanning retrospective in particular: ‘I feel a confusing juxtaposition of restless and disengaged; my palms are sweaty and there’s a risk I might vomit. I soothe myself by remembering that in an hour or thereabouts, I can skip over Millennium Bridge to Tate Modern and lose myself in \[Tanning’s\] “Endgame”...’ \[E9, p. 176\]. Mahon also spoke on ‘Women, Sex and Surrealism’ at the Doyce Street Studios’ pop\-up exhibition \(1\-7 May 2019\) organised by ‘a group of diverse artists’ and celebrating ‘beauty and sex and a sisterhood’ in response to Tanning \[E7\]. 

 **Increasing the Market Value of Women Artists’ Work to Museums and Collectors** 

 Mahon’s research on women Surrealists, notably Fini and Tanning, reached new audiences through her public talks at museums and auction houses and media coverage: MoSEX \(2018\), the Reina Sofia Madrid \(2018\), Tate Modern, London \(2019\), Fondation Giacometti, Paris \(2019\), Witte de With, Rotterdam \(2019\), Fine Art Museum, Sedona \(2019\) Christie’s, Paris \(2018, 2019\). Mahon shared her research and promoted women Surrealists in a number of podcasts \(three times for *The Art Newspaper*\), and was prominently featured in a 2019 ARTE documentary on women Surrealists, *Gelebte Träume* \(52 mins\) \[E6\]. In 2020 a record price of USD980,000 for Fini was achieved at Sotheby’s and Weinstein Gallery notes that between 2018\-2020, ‘From the website Artsy alone, we receive 3\-5 inquiries from curious collectors per week. In most all cases, they have only recently learned of the artist’ \[E4\]. In 2018 Fine Arts Brokers noted a dramatic increase in prices for Tanning with *The temptation of St Antony* \(1945\-46\) selling for USD1,152,500 \[E10, p. 6\]. Gallerist Alison Jacques, noted the impact of Tanning’s ‘well deserved retrospective at the Tate Modern last year … \[now\] her paintings can command prices between USD75,000 and $1m’ \[E10, p. 11\]. Further, Mahon advised Reina Sofia on the acquisition of 4 works – *Hôtel* \(1988, collage\), *Étreinte* \(1969, sculpture\), *Even the young girls* \(1966, painting\), *Les 7 Périls Spectraux* \(1959, lithograph\) – and National Galleries of Scotland on their bid to the Art Fund to purchase *Tableau Vivant* \(1954\). In 2020, Tate bought *Murmurs* \(1976\) and MOMA *Notes for an apocalypse* \(1976\) – both paintings featured in Mahon’s exhibition.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Oxford led to the development of treatments for the lysosomal storage disorder Niemann\-Pick disease type C \(NP\-C\), a rare but devastating multi\-system disorder. The resulting drug, miglustat, is the only drug currently licensed for NP\-C. Miglustat significantly slows disease progression, improves quality of life, increases life expectancy, and is used by the majority of NP\-C patients worldwide. In the UK, between 70% and 90% of the approximately 100 patients receive the drug. The introduction of miglustat generic drugs in 2019 has reduced costs, leading to healthcare savings. University of Oxford researchers have developed other new drugs for NP\-C that are benefiting patients worldwide in clinical trials, and new tools for monitoring disease progression that are being adopted as international standards. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

####  Developing therapies for lysosomal storage disorders 

 Niemann\-Pick disease type C \(NP\-C\) is a lysosomal storage disorder \(LSD\) in which molecules destined for breakdown and recycling \(e.g. glycosphingolipids\) accumulate to pathological levels, affecting multiple organs including the central nervous system. In prior research, Platt and colleagues at the University of Oxford had developed a glucose analogue \( *N*B\-DNJ or miglustat\) that inhibits glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, providing the potential for an oral\-based treatment for LSDs termed **‘**substrate reduction therapy’ \(SRT\). The drug was initially approved for the LSD type 1 \(Gaucher disease\) in 2002/2003 and marketed by Actelion as Zavesca. 

 Platt and her colleagues then investigated the use of miglustat in NP\-C. Although this disease had previously been considered to be a cholesterol storage disorder, in 2004 the group demonstrated that treating a patient with miglustat reduced pathological lipid storage, improved endosomal uptake and normalised lipid trafficking \[1\]. Since miglustat has no direct effect on cholesterol metabolism, this research indicated that accumulation of glycosphingolipids was the primary pathogenic event in NP\-C and so miglustat could be an effective treatment. An international clinical trial followed, and in 2009 miglustat was approved by the European Medicines Agency as the first and only targeted therapy for treating NP\-C. In 2009/10, Platt began working with the company Orphazyme to investigate whether therapies targeting the Heat\-Shock\-Protein\-70 \(HSP70\) family of chaperones might have therapeutic potential. Platt and colleagues showed in mouse models that increasing HSP70 levels by direct administration of recombinant HSP70 or with arimoclomol or a related drug bimoclomol \(both small molecule inducers of HSP70\) improved neurological function and reduced lipid storage in mouse models of three LSDs: NP\-C, Sandhoff disease and Fabry disease. These proof\-of\-concept studies were published in 2016 \[2\]. 

 In 2016, Platt started to investigate the potential of acetyl leucine as a treatment for NP\-C patients. Building on observational clinical studies that indicated that the racemic compound improved symptoms of ataxia in NP\-C patients, Platt and colleagues at the University of Oxford and elsewhere undertook work in mouse models of NP\-C. They found that the L\-enantiomer \(ALL\) but not the D\-enantiomer delayed disease progression and extended life span in mouse models, and that patients treated in the observational study showed stabilisation or improvement in multiple neurological domains, not just those relating to ataxia, after 12 months \[3\]. 

 Next, Platt and colleagues developed a second\-generation compound for SRT that also inhibits glycosphingolipid biosynthesis \- the galactose analogue of miglustat, *N*B\-DGJ. They tested this compound, named lucerastat, in a mouse model of the LSD Sandhoff disease where it showed greater therapeutic efficacy than *N*B\-DNJ \(miglustat\) with no detectable side effects \[4\]. Lucerastat could be tolerated at high dose, leading to extended life expectancy and increased delay in symptom onset. Platt and Priestman subsequently carried out preclinical work with lucerastat in collaboration with Actelion for another LSD, Fabry disease, in which the first\-line treatment is not fully effective \[5\]. 

####  Developing tools for monitoring NP\-C disease progression 

 Platt and her collaborator Mario\-Cortina Borja, an applied statistician at UCL, developed an annual severity *increment* score \(ASIS\), that uses several criteria to monitor disease severity and progression. Working with clinical colleagues they demonstrated that ASIS can be used to better stratify patients and measure response to therapy in clinical trials \[6\]. Platt and Cortina\-Borja also showed in this study that a less burdensome 5\-domain severity scale, comprising a subset of the full scale of 17 neurological domains with most relevance to quality of life, correlated well with the full scale and could therefore be used more easily and consistently to assess clinical severity in patients.

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  Background and context of impact 

 NP\-C is a rare disease \(1 in 100,000 live births\) with a highly variable but uniformly fatal clinical spectrum, ranging from a perinatal, rapidly progressive systemic disorder to an adult\-onset chronic and life\-limiting neurodegenerative form. Platt’s research has had an impact on patients with NP\-C and other LSDs in three main areas: \(a\) Miglustat is the only approved targeted therapy for the disease and has had a transformational impact on the treatment of NP\-C patients worldwide; \(b\) Benefits to the companies Orphazyme, IntraBio and Idorsia in reaching clinical trials of efficacy of new treatments, and in one case FDA Breakthrough Therapy status ahead of full approval; \(c\) development and validation of a simplified clinical severity scale that has been recommended for multiple clinical purposes including in clinical trials. 

 **“**The impact of Professor Platt’s work in the area of Lysosomal diseases and in particular NPC, has been truly immense. It has not only led to the only approved therapy for NPC, but has greatly expanded our understanding of the disease, and contributed to the development of other therapeutic targets and new ways to monitor and assess disease progression.”* 

 Niemann\-Pick UK \[A\] 

####  Impact of miglustat and its generics on quality of life 

 Multiple studies have shown that miglustat substantially slows or stabilises progression of neurological manifestations of the disease and leads to significant improvements in both life expectancy and quality of life. This is affirmed by two long\-term follow\-up studies of the largest cohort of miglustat\-treated NP\-C patients from 2009 to 2017 \[B\]. One of these studies described a range of improved treatment outcomes for 472 patients from 22 countries and reported that 70% of patients on continuous treatment had improved or had stable disease \[Bi\]. The other study found a significant reduction in the risk of mortality for 789 patients from 21 countries; compared with patients not treated, median survival of treated patients was longer by approximately 10 years from onset of the patients’ neurological manifestations \[Bii\]. 

 Miglustat is authorised for use in most countries except the US and has been recommended as the standard of care for NP\-C patients since 2018 \[C\]. There are approximately 100 NP\-C patients currently in the UK, between 70\-90% of whom are treated with miglustat. This proportion has increased from an estimated 50% in 2013, and has contributed to a greater proportion of patients diagnosed as children living into their teens/adulthood \[A\]. The number of patients diagnosed with NP\-C, in particular adult\-onset patients, has also increased in recent years \[A\]. A detailed analysis in France showed that during the period 2009\-2016, half of new NP\-C diagnoses were in adults compared with only one fifth during the period 2000\-2008, and suggested this was due to ‘ *improvement in awareness of NP\-C among neuropsychiatrists after miglustat therapy became available*’ \[D\]. 

 Although miglustat is not approved by the FDA for treatment of NP\-C in the US, it can be prescribed to patients ‘off\-label’ because it is approved for the treatment of Gaucher disease. The Mayo Clinic estimates that there are approximately 500\-600 NP\-C patients in the US, of whom at least half are treated with miglustat \[E\]. 

####  Economic benefits to pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers 

 Sales figures from Actelion, available up to 2016 before the company was taken over by Johnson and Johnson, reflect the increasing use of miglustat \(brand name Zavesca\) for NP\-C \[F\]. Total sales for miglustat \(outside the US\) were strong in 2014 \(CHF103,000,000\), with an increase since 2013 attributed to its indication for NP\-C and as a result of “ *expanding diagnostic tools and heightened awareness*”. Demand against NP\-C indication increased in 2015 and gave ‘double\-digit growth’ for 2016. The report for 2016 states that “ *Globally, patients receiving Zavesca grew by 6% compared to 2015, driven by a 13% increase in the treatment of patients with NP\-C*”. 

 Following expiry of the patent for use of Zavesca in NP\-C in 2019, generics became available that year in many countries. In the UK, all three regional contracts for miglustat use in NP\-C patients are currently held by generics companies \[G\] and in France, most patients are using generics. Generics were introduced at a reduced price compared with Zavesca and the costs of both have fallen over the subsequent 18\-month period. The saving varies across European countries from 20% to 50%. In Italy, where contract prices are available, the generic product was first marketed at EUR32 per capsule \[text removed for publication\] whereas the cost is now EUR15\-20 \[G\]. Given that the daily dose is 6 capsules, the annual saving from using the generic is of order EUR40,000 per patient, per year. The generic is the preferred drug for insurance companies in the US because of its lower cost. 

 A study published in 2020 showed that miglustat may reduce aspiration risk and improve quality of life, providing further evidence of the benefits of miglustat therapy \[H\]. This new study, along with supporting evidence from other recent studies, is being used by patient groups and \[text removed for publication\] \[E\]. 

####  Impact of other, novel treatments for NP\-C and related LSDs 

 As a result of work by Platt and collaborators \[2\], Orphazyme chose NP\-C for its first clinical trial of arimoclomol \[I\]. The Phase II/III trial in NP\-C patients \(50 in total, 34 receiving arimoclomol\) reported improvement in neurological clinical symptoms and quality of life for patients and slower rates of disease progression \(annual progression reduced by more than 60% compared with placebo\) following 12 months of treatment \[Ji, Jii, Ki\]. The best outcomes were seen in patients on miglustat and arimoclomol. Based on these findings and in order to bring the product to patients as soon as possible, the US FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designations to arimoclomol for NP\-C in November 2019 \[Kii\]. A small but increasing number of patients in the US and Europe are being treated via this expanded access programme \[I, Ki\]. Orphazyme has submitted an application for marketing approval to the FDA in the US \(July 2020\) \[Kiii\] and submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application to the European Medicines Agency in November 2020 \[Kiv\]. 

 There has also been substantial economic impact from the development of arimoclomol with Orphazyme’s CSO stating that “ *Professor Platt has been instrumental through the development of Orphazyme from being a one\-person company \[in 2010\] to one of Europe’s most prolific young biotechs....with >150 employees with offices in Denmark, US, France and Switzerland*” \[I\]. 

 In October 2020, IntraBio announced results from its trial of ALL in NP\-C \(NCT03759639, N=32\). The compound demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms, functioning, and quality of life for paediatric and adult patients with NP\-C \[L\]. 

 The company Idorsia has invested in the testing of lucerastat, the second generation miglustat analogue developed and tested by Platt and colleagues \[4,5\], through a randomised, double\-blind Phase III trial for Fabry patients across multiple international centres \(MODIFY, NCT03425539\) \[M\]. This progressive and potentially life\-threatening LSD is more common than NP\-C, affecting between 1 in 40,000 and 1 in 60,000 males, and has no fully effective first\-line treatment. 

####  Impact of tools for monitoring NP\-C disease progression 

 The work carried out by Platt and colleagues on developing tools for monitoring NP\-C disease progression \[6\] has had improved the ability to monitor treatment responses in clinical trials. Orphazyme already commenced its trial of arimoclomol before validation of the ASIS metric, but applied the metric to their initial cohort and as a result were able to recruit a larger cohort in order to be more confident of having meaningful outcomes from the study \[A\]. The company also used the 5\-domain clinical severity scale validated by Platt and Cortina\-Borja \[6\] as the primary outcome measure in its trial of arimoclomol \[I,J\] and used the ASIS metric to examine the rate of disease progression at the start and end of the trial.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Professor Geels’ research on socio\-technical transitions has transformed how reducing greenhouse gas emissions is understood and addressed. The traditional approach focused on taxes and regulations. In contrast, Geels’ research frames environmental problems in terms of underlying unsustainable socio\-technical systems, leading to new debate and policies focused on sustainable energy, food and mobility systems. This new framing and Geels’ multi\-level perspective have transformed how the European Environment Agency \(EEA\), the EU and the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Cange \(IPCC\) approach policies concerning energy, decarbonisation, and biodiversity loss. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Since September 2012, Geels has undertaken world\-leading research into socio\-technical transitions at Alliance Manchester Business School. Socio\-technical transitions are large\-scale shifts in energy, food and transport systems, which involve new technologies as well as changes in user practices, business models, cultural meanings, public policies and infrastructures. Over the last eight years, Geels has conducted multiple studies that have all demonstrated how these large\-scale shifts are needed to deliver significant climate change and sustainable development goals. An important outcome of Geels’ research using his multilevel perspective, published in *Science* \[1\], is that, instead of simple causality in transitions, it emphasizes co\-evolving elements and interacting social groups. 

 Geels’ multilevel perspective provides a ‘big\-picture’ understanding of transitions as interactions between radical niche\-innovations, established locked\-in regimes and exogenous landscape developments.  According to the multilevel perspective, radical niche\-innovations provide the seeds for socio\-technical transitions. The emergence and diffusion of these innovations depends on how they co\-evolve with social, technical, political, cultural and economic dimensions. In turn, this co\-evolution influences and is influenced by prevailing governance structures. Struggles between challengers and incumbent actors thus play out on multiple dimensions and involve various social groups. 

 Geels tested and refined his analytical framework on different historical case studies, including sea, land and air transport, water supply, farming, horticulture and coal \[2\].  He has also applied the framework to contemporary and future sustainability transitions in biogas, electricity, renewable energy technologies and automobility \[3\]. Hence, the framework has proven useful in multiple contexts. In the past eight years, socio\-technical transitions research has become a cumulative research program to which many scholars now contribute and provides a comprehensive framework for policy actors, as documented in a recent review by Geels \[4\]. 

 With regard to environmental policy, Geels’ research shows that persistent environmental problems should be considered in terms of underlying socio\-technical systems. To support the governance of sustainability transitions, identify and assess potential transition pathways, Geels developed a ‘bridging approach’ that combines insights from computer models, socio\-technical transition research and on\-the\-ground demonstration projects \[5, 6\]. By addressing the differing knowledge needs of international, national and local policymakers, this combination of approaches is more comprehensive and useful than a single catch\-all approach.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Since 2014, Geels’ research has made a substantial contribution to shaping environmental thinking and policy\-making at the international level, for example with the European Environment Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 

 **Changed Understandings and Influenced Policy Recommendations at the European Environment Agency** 

 Geels’ research has had a profound impact on the EEA, which is a scientific advisory body designed to provide independent information on the environment to inform policy\-making at European level. Impact has been facilitated through extensive engagement with EEA officials since 2014 that culminated in Geels’ appointment to the EEA’s Scientific Committee in 2017. The Committee provides scientific advice on areas of work undertaken by the Agency and is influential in framing the agenda of the Agency. As described below, Geels’ work and close involvement with the EEA has significantly influenced the EEA’s thinking and informed its knowledge base. The Executive Director of the EEA, credits Geels with “ *inform\[ing\] the European Commission, the European Parliament, Member States, and the wider public about the need to frame climate and environmental challenges in a systemic sustainability transitions perspective*” \[A\]. 

 **Changed EEA Thinking** 

 Since 2014, the EEA has explicitly adopted Professor Geels’ socio\-technical transition framework to frame the causes of persistent environmental problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource scarcity problems. The 2014 work programme *Expanding the Knowledge Base for Policy Implementation and Long\-term Transitions* \[B\] used Geels’ concept of ‘socio\-technical systems’ to argue the need for transitions. The work programme was significant because it set out the EEA’s vision and agenda for the provision of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy\-making agents across the 27 EU member states.  The work programme was the prime source of knowledge at European level informing the implementation of European and national environment and climate policies between 2014 and 2018.  One of the four Strategic Areas outlined by the work programme was ‘Assessing Systemic Challenges’, which heavily relied on Geels’ work on socio\-technical transitions. For example, environmental policy was traditionally framed in terms of externalities and input\-output problems, leading to a focus on taxes and regulations as environmental policy instruments. However, for long\-term, structural problems, the EEA recognised that this approach was not sufficient. Geels’ work helped to reframe the issues in the work programme in terms of the need to fundamentally change core socio\-technical systems \(particularly food, energy, mobility\), which involved changes in technology, markets, industry, consumption and values \[B\]. The Executive Director of the EEA has attested that “ *Professor Geels’ research on socio\-technical transitions has increased our fundamental understanding of sustainability transitions...He has been the most influential academic in the domain of sustainability transitions and technological innovation that we have worked with” \[A\].* 

 In 2016, Geels wrote a scientific background paper for the EEA based on his research into the multilevel perspective that provided key understandings of sustainability transitions. Since then, the EEA has used Geels’ multilevel perspective as an analytical framework underpinning much of its work.  For example, in 2016/2017 the EEA published three reports \( *Sustainability Transitions: Now for the Long term*; *Transitions towards a more sustainable mobility system* and *Circular by Design: Products in the Circular Economy\)* which extensively apply the multilevel perspective and draw on Geels’ work throughout. The first report uses Geels’ research \[3\] to identify the trade\-offs of transforming socio\-technical systems. The second report uses the multilevel perspective to guide empirical work in four chapters concerning the shape of future transport systems. The third report uses Geels’ observations on the dynamic and power\-laden nature of transitions to provide insights into the mechanisms required for successfully transitioning towards a circular economy. 

 This increasing reliance on Geels’ work prompted the EEA to invite Geels to write a chapter on the multilevel perspective in the EEA report *Perspectives on Transitions to Sustainability* \(2018\). The general introduction to this report \[C\] states that “ *the multi\-level perspective \(MLP\) has emerged as the dominant analytical framework for understanding transitions*”. The Executive Director of the EEA reports that the framework is utilised in several subsequent assessment reports on sustainable mobility, the circular economy, and food systems and through Geels’ research “ *our knowledge base on Sustainability Transitions has developed substantially since 2015*” \[A\]. 

 Geels’ work has most recently influenced the EEA’s five yearly flagship report SOER 2020 \( *The European Environment: State and Outlook 2020: Knowledge for Transition to a Sustainable Europe*\) \[D\] which offers science\-based insights on how society and policy\-makers must respond to huge and complex environmental challenges. The report’s analysis of worsening environmental trends stresses how Europe will not achieve its 2030 goals without urgent action to address the increasing impacts of climate change and the overconsumption of natural resources. The report uses Geels’ multilevel perspective as an organising framework and dedicates a whole chapter to Geels’ concept of transitions, namely Chapter 17 ‘Responding to Sustainability Challenges’, which references five of Geels’ Manchester publications, including \[1, 2\]. 

 **Influenced Policy Recommendations** 

 Since 2018, Geels’ research has directly fed into policy recommendations made by the EEA to the EU and its member states. Geels was the Principal Investigator on three specific service contracts for the EEA within a wider framework contract for “ *provision of expert assistance on forward\-looking analysis, sustainability assessments and systemic transitions*”. This research resulted in the 2019 EEA report *Sustainability transitions: Policy and practice* \[E\] that highlights how transitions thinking is being operationalised at different scales across Europe. The report uses the multilevel perspective as its core framework, citing 11 of Geels’ Manchester produced articles \(including \[1\], \[2\], \[3\]\). As the Executive Director of the EEA highlights, Geels’ framework underpins several of the report’s specific policy suggestions — illustrated through cases from across Europe — concerning innovation, diffusion, impacts, cities, finance, missions, and wider governance challenges; as such, Geels provides “ *concrete approaches and instruments that policymakers can use to advance sustainability transitions*” \[A\]. 

 The EEA launched its Policy and Practice report on sustainability transitions \[E\] on 10 September 2019 in Brussels at a closed, high\-level meeting, with participation from one deputy secretary\-general, four directors\-general, two deputy directors\-general, and six directors from multiple European Commission departments, including the departments of Environment, Climate Action, Research and Innovation, Regional and Urban Policy, Agriculture and Rural Development, and Mobility and Transport. This endorsement enabled the report to feed into discussions about the European Green Deal, which is an ambitious set of policy initiatives by the European Commission with the aim to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050 across buildings, agri\-food, energy and mobility systems. The Green Deal will affect all 27 member\-states and will invest an estimated EUR1,000,000,000,000 in sustainable transitions to a carbon neutral society \[F\].  As the Executive Director of the EEA attests: “ *The ideas developed over the last years of collaboration \[with Geels\] are deeply embedded in the European Green Deal, formulated by the President of the European Commission, Mrs. Von der Leyen … I am confident to say that it is the thinking of academics like Professor Geels that is pivotal to our society meeting challenges framed in the Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals and multiple other ambitious processes of European and global importance.” \[A\]* 

 **Informing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\)** 

 Geels’ research has had a pivotal influence on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\), a body of the United Nations that provides evidenced\-based advice to governments and citizens to help society tackle global climate change. 

 Geels gave a Keynote Talk in 2016 at the Scoping Meeting of the IPCC for the Special Report on 1.5<sup>0</sup>C Global Warming.  The corresponding IPCC report \[G\], *Global warming of 1.5<sup>0</sup>C* \(published in October 2018\), was strongly framed in transition terms, especially Chapter 2 \(on mitigation pathways\) and Chapter 4 \(strengthening and implementing the global response\). The report explicitly defines Geels’ concept of socio\-technical transitions in its glossary of key underpinning concepts and terms, and cites Geels numerous times, drawing on five of his publications, including \[1\], \[2\], \[3\] and \[6\]. The report recognises that *“the socio\-technical transition literature points to multiple complexities in real\-world settings that prevent reaching ‘idealised’ policy conditions but at the same time can still accelerate transformative change through other co\-evolutionary processes of technology and society \(Geels et al., 2017\).”* \[G\] 

 The IPCC report argued that limiting climate change to 1.5<sup>0</sup>C will require deep and rapid transitions in several systems \(energy, land\-use, cities, transport and industry\). The report received global coverage in the media. The New York Times described it as a “ *landmark report*” \[H\]. It featured on the front page of The Guardian and on the evening news reports of ABC, NBC and PBS in the USA. 

 Following the IPCC report, the Secretary General of the United Nations convened a Climate Action Summit in December 2019. The official report from the summit recognized that “ *the Climate Action Summit reinforced 1.5°C as the socially, economically, politically and scientifically safe limit to global warming by the end of this century*” \[I\].  The report calls for nations to develop plans “ *in line with the findings of the IPCC 1.5<sup>0</sup>C report*” and observes that the summit secured “ *the commitments of 70 countries to deliver more ambitious NDCs \[Nationally Determined Contributions\] in 2020 in line with net zero emissions by 2050 strategies*” \[I\]. 

 As a result of Geels’ expertise and influence following his involvement with the Scoping Meeting of the IPCC for the Special Report on 1.5<sup>0</sup>C Global Warming, Geels was chosen to be a Lead Author for the Working Group III contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report \(AR6, due in 2021\), particularly for Chapter 5 – “ *Demand, services and social aspects of mitigation*” \[J\]. The IPCC Assessment reports are important policy\-relevant documents that feed into the international negotiations to address climate change.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A team at the Department for Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge have developed novel technologies, tools and processes to transform online interactive and blended learning for 14\-19 year\-old students and teachers. The approach has been applied to learning physics through the Isaac Physics platform and, more recently, to learning Computer Science. The impact of this research has been to: 

-  <ins>improve grades and University entrance outcomes</ins> for A\-level students studying physics. Engaging with the Isaac platform can significantly raise a cohort’s A level grades and increase their attainment of places at Russell Group Universities. This contributes towards government priorities to increase STEM graduates to meet the current skills shortage. 

-  <ins>support students</ins> from non\-traditional HE backgrounds and engage under\-represented groups like women in Physics. Approximately 21% of the current A\-level cohort are women, but over the past 6.5 years 34\-36% of Isaac Physics online users have been women. 

-  <ins>reduce teachers’ workload and contribute to high quality physics lessons</ins>. Teachers using Isaac Physics report an average reduction in workload of 3.8 hours per week, freeing up time for the development of skills and resources. The School Standards Minister, Nick Gibb, commented in 2018 that “Isaac Physics…has already helped thousands of teachers to deliver high quality physics lessons”. 

-  <ins>engage 30% of all A level computer science students in England</ins> through the Isaac Computer Science platform

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Andrew Rice, an expert in programming and software engineering, and Professor Alastair Beresford, an expert in computer security and mobile systems, observed that students arrived at the University of Cambridge with very diverse backgrounds in programming, and therefore the content and pace of lectures which might be suitable for one student were unsuitable for another. As a result, Beresford and Rice developed new online methods and technologies to enhance the teaching of computer programming at the University. 

 <ins>Supporting the teaching of the computer language</ins> <ins>Prolog</ins> 

 Using their joint expertise in programming languages and tools in the sciences, Beresford and Rice wrote software and produced short videos focused around the undergraduate course on teaching programming in Prolog. However, they wanted to go beyond the passive viewing experience and encourage more interaction and feedback tailored to an individual student’s understanding. To achieve this, they developed the first version of the Interactive Lecture Video Platform \(ILVP\) that supported in\-video quizzes with immediate feedback on numerical and multiple choices answers, and that supported a variety of viewing approaches \(e.g. once\-through, twice\-through, section repeat, skipping\). 

 In ‘Investigating Engagement’ \[R1\], Beresford and Rice analysed how students used the video and quiz feedback to test their knowledge, skipping content they were familiar with and revisiting more challenging content. The statistics gathered by the platform demonstrated that students made significant use of non\-linear playback for both learning and revision. This data was complemented with semi\-structured interviews and online surveys to analyse the effectiveness of this new method of delivery. The data showed a high level of engagement: students viewed over 80% of the videos on average. Of those that viewed videos at least once, they attempted over 80% of the embedded multiple choice and text entry questions. The less popular questions were thought to be due to an increased difficulty \(later addressed through hints below\), and an over\-questioning \(once every two minutes\) on one video. A rate of one question every eight minutes seemed acceptable. The analysis of student questionnaires also strongly suggested that the questions should be designed with a variety of student motivations in mind, including Completionism, Challenge Seeking, Feedback and Revision. Since 2012\-2013, the Prolog course has been taught using this new style of teaching, and in 2014 Rice and Beresford won a Cambridge Pilkington Prize for a substantial and excellent contribution to a teaching programme within the University. 

 <ins>Expansion to Physics</ins> 

 In 2013, the Department of Physics at Cambridge University were bidding for funding from the DfE to improve physics problem\-solving in English schools, with the intention of encouraging more students to take STEM subjects to fill the recognised skills gap and shortage of good physics and maths teachers. Based on the success of the Prolog course, Professor Mark Warner and Dr Lisa Jardine\-Wright from the Department of Physics met with Rice and Beresford to discuss their experience with online platforms for what was to become the Isaac Platform. Rice and Beresford’s initial work on ILVP was a useful starting point, but significant new features were required to deliver an interactive problem\-solving platform for physics. 

 <ins>Equation entry and feedback on structure and correctness.</ins> 

 In particular, interactive learning of the core mathematics underlying the physics teaching would require the entry and parsing of equations. In 2015 Rice, Beresford and their colleagues created a new tool for the platform, *Equality*, for equation entry using free\-form layout of components drawn from a palette of symbols. This was designed to enable learners to manipulate the structure of their equations easily on both desktop and mobile environments, and to minimize the amount of experience required to use the tool \[R2\]. In particular, it emphasized the ability to easily revise the structure of equations after entry, while remaining machine\-readable for effective feedback. Later work added the ability for the feedback software to evaluate the structure of answers as well as their mathematical correctness, in order to provide better feedback on aspects such as simplification or factorisation \[R3\]. 

 <ins>Hints</ins> 

 Early work \[R1\] had indicated that the more difficult questions were attempted less often. This led the group to investigate hints as a form of scaffolding for users of Isaac Physics in 2016 \[R4\]. Hints were classified in to five main types \(Concepts, Information, Diagrams, Equations and Videos\), and student behaviour was analysed to determine common patterns of usage, including motivations such as Decomposition, Correction, Verification and Comparison. 

 The results of this research was then used to provide students with more effective revisions and feedback, so that the more difficult physics questions become less intimidating and more flexible. 

 <ins>Privacy\-aware data sharing</ins> 

 Online educational tools often generate learning data, and sharing such data between tutors and students can often improve learning outcomes. However, too much data sharing may put off the less confident students. For example, the number of incorrect attempts at the in\-video quizzes is not made known to teachers so that students are encouraged to experiment and learn from the feedback. To make data sharing more palatable to students, the group investigated the transparency and user control aspects \[R5\]. The developed approach uses tokens through which students may grant \(and revoke\) access to their latest answers, to individually identified tutors. This gives the students control over their learning data, and helps to build trust in their tutors, particularly when those tutors are not provided directly by their teaching institution. 

 <ins>Overall</ins> 

 These research advances work together to provide Isaac Physics with a powerful and easy\-to\-use platform combining the interactive video learning with flexible quizzing, immediate feedback, effective hinting, and straightforward revision. In September 2019, the Isaac Computer Science platform, which uses the same underlying technology found in Isaac Physics, was launched.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Isaac Physics platform, based on the Cambridge group’s research, is playing a crucial part in transforming physics teaching. It has achieved impressive reach: a quarterly report to The Department for Education \(DfE\) at the end of August 2019 showed that, across all year groups, there were 55,481 active users of Isaac Physics \(206,570 registered users\), of whom 7,603 were teachers \[E1\]. Currently more than 3,600 schools participate, many with over 50 students registered. Monthly, 28,000 students and 1,300 teachers use the platform with daily peaks of 145,000 problems answered \[E2\]. 

 In relation to A\-level physics students in UK schools specifically, over the period August 2017 to January 2018, there were 11,604 Isaac Physics users in year 12, and 6,758 in year 13 \[E3 page 13\]. Since roughly the same number of students study A level physics in years 12 and 13 in the UK overall \(around 36,000 students in each year group\) \[E4\], this equates to at least 25% of the A\-level cohort being users of Isaac Physics \[E3, page 13\]. 

 The significance of this impact is described below: 

 <ins> **Impact 1:**</ins> <ins>improving</ins> <ins>grade</ins><ins>s and University entrance</ins> <ins>outcomes for A\-level students studying physics</ins>. 

 As a result of a collaboration with the UCAS STROBE service, the Isaac Physics user cohort was compared with 500 non\-Isaac Physics cohorts, matched to remove potential biases, including demographic, GCSE grades, gender, and ethnicity. The analysis found that results at schools which actively engage with the Isaac platform show an improvement equivalent to 40% of the cohort raising their grade from C to B \[E3, page 3\]. Furthermore, when compared with non\-users, Isaac Physics students were very significantly more likely to apply to, receive an offer from, and accept a place at high tariff universities. The correlation between the amount of Isaac activity and achievement of predicted grades was strongest for students applying to Russell Group universities, showing that using Isaac Physics improves chances of a place at leading universities \[E3\]. When asked, 74% of students agreed or strongly agreed that the Isaac platform helped them to improve their physics grade, and 75% said it helped them become more confident in physics \[E3\]. 

 <ins> **Impact 2:**</ins> <ins>supporting</ins> <ins>students from non\-traditional HE backgrounds and under\-represented groups in Physics:</ins> 

 Physics students from non\-traditional HE backgrounds may be under\-supported by their schools, teachers or families, who are insufficiently experienced with the requirements of HE entry. The Isaac platform provides access to many of the resources that these students are missing. The technology enables them to self\-study by providing hints and online tutorials, and gives them direct access to subject specialists. Progression in difficulty allows students to continually challenge themselves. One student wrote: ""When I started in November 2016 I was doing level 1\-3 questions, sometimes even struggling with these.  Now I am frequently tackling level 4\-6 questions, on topics that I have <ins>self\-taught</ins> through the Isaac platform.  That alone is testament to how much progress I have made thanks to this site"" \[E3\]. 

 Under\-represented students are those whose participation in physics is less than half the level that their group size would merit, irrespective of HE backgrounds. Approximately 21% of the current A\-level physics cohort are women, but over the past 6.5 years, 34\-36% of Isaac Physics online users have been women \[E2\]. ""Fear of failure"" is a well\-documented issue for under\-represented groups, particularly women \[E5\]. The Isaac platform has been designed and built as a low stakes, high\-trust environment to enable such students to develop confidence, realise that getting things wrong is part of the learning process, and that reflection leads to progression. Typically, students take three attempts to get questions right, demonstrating a level of resilience and confidence in the process. 

 The value of the online learning platform and the project more widely to improving student access to Physics has been recognised by DfE, who awarded the project GBP6.3 million in 2014, and a further GBP1.05 million in 2018. The School Standards Minister, Nick Gibb, said of the funding announced in 2018: “As part of our modern Industrial Strategy, we are focused on helping young people improve their knowledge and skills in science, technology, engineering and maths. Entries to A Level physics have increased by 18% since 2010 but the Government wants to see even more young people – especially girls and those from disadvantaged backgrounds – pursuing sciences” \[E6\]. 

 The 2019 Lawrence Bragg Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics was awarded to Dr Lisa Jardine\-Wright and Prof Mark Warner \(the Physicists co\-directing the project\) in recognition of the scale and reach of Isaac Physics. The award recognised that “this radical, mass\-scale programme harnesses technology to help all students, especially those exposed to the national shortage of physics teachers with consequent social disadvantage in entering STEM at university” \[E2\]. 

 The Ogden Trust, a charitable trust founded to help science students from less\-well\-off families, also provides funding to Isaac Physics \(including a gift of GBP350,000 in 2018\). Clare Harvey, Ogden Chief Executive, said: ""We are really pleased to be involved with Isaac Physics….The continued, and growing, engagement with the platform by teachers and students is really encouraging and the feedback shows what a positive impact Isaac Physics is having on those who use it” \[E6\]. 

 **Impact 3:** <ins>enabling</ins> <ins>teachers to reduce their workload</ins><ins>, freeing time to develop skills and produce quality physics lessons</ins><ins>.</ins> 

 Teachers can use the Isaac platform to set, mark and report homework, saving thousands of labour hours monthly. Most teachers feel their marking workload is too great, and cite workload as a major reason for leaving the profession \[E7\]. The Isaac platform has a direct impact on improving teachers’ workload. Teachers who use Isaac have self\-reported an average reduction in workload of 3.8 hours per week which in turn frees up time for improving teaching and learning \[E1\]. The School Standards Minister, Nick Gibb, commented in 2018 that “Isaac Physics, which the government funds and supports, has already helped thousands of teachers to deliver high quality physics lessons” \[E6\]. Teachers also report that the platform and associated outreach events like the Teacher Symposia help to develop their own knowledge of physics and their teaching abilities \[E8\]. A female teacher of Physics to A level at an academically non\-selective state school commented: “first and foremost, this has given me a chance to upskill and therefore it has a direct impact on my teaching practice” \[E3\]. Another teacher commented that the symposium “was useful to gain a better insight into the functionality of Isaac Physics. I had not been aware of many of the features and I can now see much more clearly how to embed it in my teaching and make the best possible use of it” \[E8\]. Analysis shows that teachers who set and track student homework using Isaac also answer questions themselves to enhance their own problem\-solving ability and subject knowledge \[E3\]. 

 <ins> **Impact 4:**</ins> <ins>e</ins><ins>xpansion to Computer Science</ins> 

 Building on the success of Isaac Physics, the University and the Raspberry Pi Foundation received GBP4 million in funding from the DfE in November 2018, to introduce Isaac Computer Science for A level students in England. The Isaac Computer Science platform uses the same underlying technology found in Isaac Physics and was launched in September 2019. 

 Over 30% of all A level computer science students in England are now using the platform \[E9\], and since its launch, over 2,200 teachers and 27,000 students have joined the Isaac Computer Science community \[E10\]. There are 39 separate topics and 527 questions on the platform, covering the whole A Level specification. Each question has three hints, with video support in the hints, and students have made in excess of 1.2 million question attempts. The platform also supports online and in\-person events, and the project has run 55 events since September 2019, including 31 online in recent months, engaging 385 teachers and 710 students \[E9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) protocol is used by billions of people on a daily basis for secure web browsing, and many other activities such as e\-commerce, social networking and Internet banking. In 2013, Paterson led a team that found significant cryptographic weaknesses in the RC4 encryption algorithm when used in the TLS protocol. At that time, RC4 was used in approximately 50% of all TLS\-secured web browsing sessions. As a direct consequence of the research, major vendors including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla removed RC4 as an encryption option in their browsers, and the RC4 usage figure is now well below 1%. By identifying and fixing a problem in a protocol that is core to Internet security, the research has benefitted the world’s digital infrastructure and its billions of daily users. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 By default, Internet traffic is vulnerable to eavesdropping and modification. Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) is a protocol that has become the *de facto* method for securing application\-layer messages sent on the Internet. TLS is implemented in all major web browsers and servers and is used daily by billions of people for applications such as e\-commerce, social networking and Internet banking. 

 In a sequence of papers published in top conference venues beginning in 2013 \[R1 to R5\], a team led by Prof. Paterson identified flaws in the way TLS encrypts data when it uses a particular encryption algorithm, RC4. This resulted in cryptographic attacks that compromised the confidentiality goal of TLS. The flaws result from the RC4 algorithm having many tiny biases in its outputs. These biases make it possible to infer plaintext data that should be protected by TLS in certain situations, such as when TLS is used to protect browser\-to\-website communications. The team systematically explored RC4 biases, found ways to exploit them in attacks in the TLS context, did simulation work to estimate attack complexities, and then implemented the attacks to validate the findings \[R1\]. As part of the follow\-up work, the team analysed the attack scenarios more carefully and uncovered even more powerful attacks \[R4\]. This work established that RC4 in TLS had no long\-term future. In turn this forced the industry to act in changing how browsers use TLS. 

 At the time the 2013 analysis \[R1\] was announced, roughly 50% of all TLS traffic was using RC4. This figure had become inflated because of prior work attacking the other widely deployed encryption mode in TLS, the subject of a REF 2014 case study from RHUL. Paterson’s team, and other researchers \(notably Vanhoef and Piessens at USENIX 2015\), then built on the 2013 paper to drive the attacks towards practicality. The end result was that the continued used of RC4 in TLS became indefensible. By the middle of 2018, less than 1% of all TLS traffic was using RC4 \[R5\]. 

 In addition, Paterson’s 2014 papers at FSE \[R2\] and ASIACRYPT \[R3\] showed that similar attacks could be applied to an important wireless encryption protocol, WPA/TKIP. In their follow\-up work in 2015, Vanhoef and Piessens showed that the 2014 WPA/TKIP attack could be made fully practical, meaning that this protocol is no longer safe to use. 

 The initial team consisted of AlFardan \(PhD student, now Principal Security Architect at Cisco\), Bernstein \(Research Professor at University of Illinois, Chicago\), Paterson \(EPSRC Leadership Fellow, now Professor of Computer Science at ETH Zurich\), Poettering \(PDRA, now at IBM Research, Switzerland\) and Schuldt \(PDRA, now permanent staff member at AIST Japan\). One of the follow\-up works involved van der Merwe \(EPSRC CDT PhD student, now Head of Cryptographic Engineering with Mozilla\) and Garman \(visiting scientist from Johns Hopkins University, USA, now Assistant Professor at Purdue University\). One of the papers was an invited paper at ASIACRYPT 2014 \[R3\], corresponding to Paterson’s prestigious invited talk at the same conference. Another of the papers \[R5\] won a Distinguished Paper Award at ACM Internet Measurement Conference in 2018.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Accelerating the deprecation of RC4 and improvement of Transport Layer Security** 

 In February 2015, the IETF, the organization that maintains the TLS standard, published a document entitled “Prohibiting RC4 Cipher Suites” formally deprecating the use of RC4 in TLS, see \[E8\]. This document cites Paterson’s 2013 research paper, stating “ *Recent cryptanalysis results \[…\] exploit biases in the RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted plaintexts. These recent results are on the verge of becoming practically exploitable \[…\] As a result, RC4 can no longer be seen as providing a sufficient level of security for TLS sessions.*” 

 Major vendors, including **Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla changed the way their desktop and mobile browsers perform encryption** in TLS as a direct consequence of the research. This is clearly evidenced in the accompanying letters of support from Apple \[E1\], Google \[E2\] and Mozilla \[E3\], and from the formal Microsoft announcement in September 2015 that RC4 would no longer be supported in its browsers \[E6\]; similar public announcements were made by Google \[E5\] and Mozilla \[E7\], also in September 2015. These four vendors account for the vast majority of the web\-browsing market. Google, Microsoft and Mozilla performed a coordinated switch off of RC4 in their browsers in early 2016, while Apple disabled RC4 in version 10 of Safari desktop \(and in iOS 10 in mobile clients\) in September 2016. 

 The world’s leading content distribution networks and website hosting services also changed their default configurations to stop using RC4. A good example is provided by Cloudflare, whose letter of support \[E4\] states that Paterson’s research “ *represented a real threat to the security of TLS*” and also states that *“\[a\]s a result of the work, Cloudflare changed the TLS configuration for millions of web domains*”. 

 The amount of TLS traffic encrypted using RC4 has dropped sharply – from approximately 50% of all traffic in 2013 to reach less than 1% by the middle of 2018. This drop is documented in Paterson’s award\-winning paper published at ACM IMC 2018, and there is a clear correlation between a drop in the amount of RC4 traffic with the switching off of support for RC4 in major browsers \(see figure below, taken directly from the ACM IMC paper\) \(R5\). 



 As well as leading to the abandonment of RC4 in TLS in web browsers, Paterson’s RC4 research promoted the widespread adoption of TLS 1.2 in web browsers and web servers. TLS 1.2 was standardized in 2008 but, in early 2013, before Paterson’s RC4 research was announced, none of the four main web browsers supported this later version of TLS offering stronger encryption options. By mid\-2018, all four browsers did, and the amount of traffic using stronger encryption algorithms \(namely AES\-GCM\) is now approximately 90% \(the majority of the remainder still uses CBC mode, and, as noted above, almost none uses RC4\). To quote from Mozilla’s letter of support \[E3\], “ *As a direct result of this work, the TLS community rapidly moved to deprecate RC4, resulting in RFC 7465, which banned them entirely*” and “ *Dr. Paterson’s work was also a major impetus behind the move to AES\-GCM.*” This impact is also evidenced by Apple’s letter of support \[E1\]: “ *TLS 1.2 adoption rates went from a negligible percentage in 2013 to around 90% by 2016*”. 

 In April 2014, the IETF TLS Working Group began to work on a new version of TLS, and this work was completed in late 2018 with the issuance of TLS 1.3 as RFC 8446 \( [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)\). This new version does not allow RC4 at all; the TLS Working Group’s charter \( [https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tls/charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tls/charter)\) explicitly says that one of the priorities for TLS 1.3 was to “ *Update record payload protection cryptographic mechanisms and algorithms to address known weaknesses in the CBC block cipher modes and to replace RC4*.” Thus, Paterson’s research is having a long\-lasting impact on the development of the TLS protocol as a whole. To quote from Mozilla’s letter \[E3\], “ *It is very rare to see this direct and immediate an impact by research on a standard as widely deployed as TLS*”. 

 Beyond the impact of the research on the web, it has impacted other sectors including improving the security of card payment data protection. The initial RHUL attack on RC4 in 2013 was assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures record \(CVE\-2013\-2566\). In 2014 the CVE score eventually became high enough that the US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) published “Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) Implementations” \[E9\] in which the use of RC4 was not approved. Following the NIST guidelines in February 2015 the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council banned the use of RC4 when assessing compliance with the PCI\-DSS standard for payment data protection \[E10\]. 

 **Global benefits of improved security** 

 Since just about everything that we do on the Internet, including e\-commerce, website logins and e\-mail relies for its security on TLS, a vulnerability in TLS has a blanket impact, affecting individuals, service providers, merchants, governments, utilities and the military. More succinctly, identifying and fixing a security problem in a protocol that is core to Internet security benefits the approximately 4,800,000,000 Internet users \( [http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet\-users/](http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/)\), which includes the 2,200,000,000 email users and the approximately 600,000,000 website owners, as well as the companies that provide service hosting solutions and the service providers that run them. The global annual value of e\-commerce alone has been estimated at several trillions of US dollars. To suggest a percentage of this that could be affected by the research would be speculation, and of course by detecting and preventing a problem we lose the chance to measure its effects. However, it is clear that the total value of e\-commerce makes it an enormous target that justifies attacker efforts to implement very sophisticated attack strategies, and so the research to identify and fix serious vulnerabilities in TLS, the main protocol used to secure e\-commerce, and thereby to contain losses, is absolutely vital. The longer\-term beneficiary is the emerging electronic society at large, which will benefit from having more secure, and therefore more confidence\-inspiring systems. We conclude by quoting from Cloudflare’s letter of support \[E4\]: “ *This research was highly significant: TLS is one of the world's most important secure protocols, and the foundation for most secure communications on the Internet, so understanding and improving its security is of critical importance to Cloudflare’s mission and the Internet at large*.”

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Simeon Nelson and Rob Godman’s research at the University of Hertfordshire \(UH\) deploys large\-scale sculpture, video and spatial sound performance to offer new insights into pattern, perception, and systemic connections between art and science. Working with a range of leading arts and funding organisations, their work has been shared with the public through exhibitions, public artworks, *lumières*, performances, publications, lectures and community outreach. Their public artworks have reached non\-academic audiences in excess of 1.46 million, outreach work with 14 schools has reached over 1,100 students, and cumulative audiences of over 3,300 have attended concert performances. Feedback and evaluations demonstrate that the works have inspired audiences to think about scientific concepts, encouraging a greater understanding of our place in the world. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Nelson and Godman have worked for over ten years on interdisciplinary art/science projects collaborating with scientists, engineers, programmers and producers to create visual art and sound installations which evoke natural phenomena, such as the cellular aberrations of cancer, and scientific concepts from fluid mechanics to models of the cosmos. Their projects explore the human response to pattern, change and decay. They provoke questions about scale and the relationship between disorder and order, including the relationship of the human scale to the very small and very large. The physical and sonic scale and structure of the works are organised around geometric and iterative systems – repeating forms into which some kind of anomaly is introduced. Three\-dimensional multi\-speaker spatialisation is an intrinsic aspect of the overall experience. 

 **Plenum \(2010\-2012\)** is a computer\-generated architectural light projection, developed by Nelson and Godman with computer scientist/artist Nick Rothwell \(Ravensbourne University London\). It was shown at festivals in the UK and Europe, projected onto buildings including King's College Chapel, Cambridge and at KickArts \(now NorthSite\) Contemporary Arts gallery, Cairns, Australia. Based on textbook illustrations of crystal lattices, the light and sound projection runs on a 15\-minute algorithmic loop; no two iterations are the same. Its custom code employs the physics of gravity and attraction: every point affects and is affected by every other point. 

 This collaboration led to a residency and commission funded by the Wellcome Trust and University College London Hospital NHS Trust, **Anarchy in the Organism \(2012\-2014\)**, which challenged attitudes to cancer. By situating it within a wider context of complex evolving systems from cities to trees to landscapes, the work attempts to reconcile cancer as an inherent feature of being in the world. It consists of four 55\-inch screens in portrait format embedded in a geometric vinyl pattern on which computer\-generated organisms demonstrate growth, mutation and decay as systemic aspects of life. The sound features constantly changing tempi, creating a shifting accelerando/rallentando effect; any definitive pulse becomes difficult to ascertain and perceptually chaotic. 

 This interdisciplinary collaborative practice was taken forward into **Cosmoscope \(2015\-2018\)**, led by Nelson in collaboration with Godman, Rothwell and a team of physicists working on three scales: the very small, the human and the very large. It culminated in a monumental sound and light sculpture made of 52 laser\-cut steel 3D Platonic elements bolted together into a spherical geometry. Sound and light patterns propagated through it via 2,000 integrated LEDs and 16 loudspeakers suggestive of time and length scales from the infinitesimal to the infinite. By situating humans at the midpoint of the quantum and the cosmological scales, *Cosmoscope* asked the viewer ‘what is our place in the universe?’. 

 **Faraday Waves \(2016\-18\),** led by Godman, is a short audio\-visual work written as a companion piece for a concert\-hall performance of *Poème électronique* by Varese, and takes its source material from the classic ‘Faraday Waves’ undergraduate physics experiment. Michael Faraday \(1831\) discovered that the flat surface of a liquid undergoing vertical vibration, whose frequency exceeds a certain value, becomes unstable, forming non\-linear standing waves. Godman collaborated with Professor Stephen Morris \(Physics Department, University of Toronto\), creating video documentation of the Faraday experiment using sound as the stimulus. The project’s visualisation, created by Samantha Jury \(UH\), uses this documentation, and visualises vibration and sound as the starting point for the creation of the music. The musical composition uses speech rhythms found in the E.E. Cummings poem “\[i carry your heart with me\(i carry it in\]”. Sounds are constructed from the resonance formed through the cross\-synthesis of a child's voice and an English bell peal, symbolizing the creation and birth of a new life.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Nelson and Godman’s works have inspired a broad range of audiences – cultural audiences, school participants, teachers, patients, academics and practitioners – to engage with the connections between art and science. The projects have experimented with varied contexts, themes and media in which to allow this science/art relationship to unfold, sharing findings with both public\-art and concert\-hall environments. 

 Cumulative audiences for the public artworks are in excess of 1.46 million, and concert hall performances have reached over 3,400. Outreach activities have extended the impact to over 1,100 school children, students and family members. This has stimulated cultural tourism, contributed to the quality of the tourist experience, and to economic impact of over £7.6 million. Through engaging with diverse audiences as well as those who may not normally access such types of media or arts programmes, the research has increased cultural participation, and has led to reported benefits to individuals’ wellbeing and impacts within education. 

 **Cosmoscope** 

 *Cosmoscope,* produced in partnership with arts production company Artichoke, aimed to “introduce questions about human biology and the context of life on earth to the widest possible audiences, through a large\-scale light and sound sculpture incorporating molecular physics, biomedicine and cosmology” \[ **5.1**\] – reaching beyond the traditional science audience. It has been experienced by substantial audiences across the country, principally as part of Lumiere, the UK’s largest light festival. It was first presented at Lumiere Durham \(16\-19 November 2017\), which attracted 245,000 visitors; it was then shown at Lumiere London \(18\-24 January 2018\), with an audience of 1,200,000 \[ **5.1**\]. *Cosmoscope* was 7<sup>th</sup> most cited, out of 29 light installations in total, when visitors were asked ‘which installations made you think about science?’ \[ **5.2**\]. 

 Artichoke delivered a schools outreach project in partnership with Durham County Council. 420 primary school pupils from 14 schools across County Durham took part in workshops related to *Cosmoscope* \[ **5.1**\]. These contributed towards learning objectives in KS2 Science, Art and Maths \[ **5.4**\]. Artichoke worked with schools at a measurable disadvantage \(e.g. higher than average free school meals\), and those who have limited or no access to arts or extracurricular activities \[ **5.1**\]. The children investigated key questions posed by *Cosmoscope*; they then created their own artworks, which were exhibited as part of Lumiere – this encouraged further engagement with *Cosmoscope* by the children and their families, increasing cultural participation and providing “public recognition for their achievements, improving their self\-esteem and wellbeing” \[ **5.4**\]. Nearly all pupils – 99% – identified something they had learned from the experience, most commonly “the smallest things in the universe \(quarks\) and the biggest things in the universe \(cosmic web\)…the inside of human bodies/cells and space / the universe”. 72% said there was no aspect that they hadn’t enjoyed \[ **5.2**\]. Teachers praised the experience and the learning opportunities it provided: “a fantastic project which all the children were excited to take part in. Even though the topic is quite a difficult concept for Year 3 and 4 children, it was delivered brilliantly so the children were interested.”; “It provided fantastic art opportunities and opportunities for scientific exploration. The range of activities…engaged all pupils”. Teachers also anticipated taking concepts from the project into the curriculum, and “including more art in relation to science” \[ **5.2**\]. Activity packs and resources were made available to any school on request. 

 *Cosmoscope* had a workshop stand at *Celebrate Science* \(24\-26 October 2017\), Durham University’s family science festival \(c.8,500 attendees overall\). The stand’s feedback wall reveals children engaged with learning about ‘galaxies’, ‘the stars’, ‘physics’, ‘cells’, and ‘light’ \[ **5.4**\]. 

 Durham County Council concluded: “the 2017 Lumiere Festival was a significant success in terms of both economic and social impact”, with a total net economic impact of £7.6m \[ **5.3**\]; 91% of attendees reported visiting Durham specifically for Lumiere \[ **5.2**\]. *Cosmoscope’s* inclusion is likely to have played a solid role in this stimulation to cultural tourism, having been identified by Artichoke as “a highlight for the audiences in both Durham and London” \[ **5.1**\]. Images were shared on social media and featured in national and international press, with the *Daily Mail* identifying *Cosmoscope* as “one of the most moving sights” at Lumiere \[ **5.5**\]. 

 The New Scientist created a video showcasing *Cosmoscope*, the team and concepts behind it and how it was made \(‘ *See inside the universe in this stunning light sculpture*’, 18 January 2018\); the video had received c.4,800 views on YouTube by the end of 2020. It was also discussed in The Psychologist, the official organ of the British Psychological Society, read by more than 50,000 members \[ **5.5**\]. 

 *Cosmoscope* continued to reach further audiences, with an installation at the Watts Gallery’s *Moonscapes* exhibition \(9 April – 23 June 2019\), which coincided with the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the moon landing. *Cosmoscope* was one of four ‘contemporary art interventions’ installed in the grounds of the gallery \(c.10,000 visitors\). Reviews of *Moonscapes –* covered in local and national press as well as specialist publications – demonstrate how the dramatic appearance of *Cosmoscope*, at this gallery known principally for Victorian art, prompted viewers to engage with its scientific concepts: “startling…an extraordinary construction in the gardens as you arrive” \(Fortean Times, 1 June 2019\); “spectacular…a splendid attempt to conjure an inter\-galactic sense of awe and wonder” \(Farnham Herald, 4 April 2019\).  Nelson and Godman gave a talk at the Gallery about *Cosmoscope* and the themes of science, myth and the visual arts – an attendee stated: “the whole course put ‘Moonscapes’ in a historical and scientific context”. \[ **5.6**\] 

 **Anarchy in the Organism** 

 Originally conceived as a public artwork with the aim of challenging attitudes to cancer, installed at UCLH Macmillan Cancer Centre, London \(2011\-2013\), Godman later created a scored algorithmic concert\-hall version for Eb Clarinet, responsive electronics and video \(a collaboration with Dr Kate Romano and the Goldfield Ensemble\). This migration from public art to concert hall introduced the research to a second, distinct audience thus increasing and diversifying its reach. Two high\-profile concert performances for this chamber version were achieved: 

  -  Huddersfield International Music Festival \(October 2013\) – audience c. 400 \(capacity\) 

  -  Kings Place, London \(January 2014\) – audience c. 120 \(75% capacity\) \[ **5.7**\] 

 A focus group conducted after a small\-scale, intimate performance at the Frome Festival \(July 2015, c.40 attendees\) revealed a profound personal effect on audience members’ understanding of cancer, with reported benefits to their wellbeing: “ *I am a cancer sufferer and people were saying to me ‘are you sure you want to go to this?’ I’m so glad I did. It has taught me so much and put my illness into context. It has made me feel a lot better about this illness*.” “ *Thank you for tonight, very helpful to someone recovering from cancer*.” “ *Personally, the whole project has opened up whole new understanding, information and emotions towards the subject of cancer. Artistically and creatively, it has stimulated my own further exploration into the subject*.” \[ **5.8**\] 

 Public talks further extended the project’s reach: *Art and Cancer* at the ONCA Centre for Art and Ecology \(July 2016\) where Nelson discussed the human implications of *Anarchy in The Organism* for an audience of 50 health workers and artists; a public lecture at the London Laser Talks \(November 2016\) where Nelson and one of the scientific collaborators on the team, Dr Simon Walker\-Samuel \(UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging\) discussed the project’s intersection of art, science and technology. This attracted an audience of c.65 artists, academics, students and public; feedback indicated they found the talks engaging, with all responses rating them very good or excellent \[ **5.9**\]. 

 The *Anarchy in the Organism* collaboration had a lasting influence on the ensemble’s creative practice; Romano states: “the process of working with Rob enabled all Goldfield musicians to fully understand the role of a sound projectionist; we consider Rob a fellow chamber musician, not a technician.” It has become part of the established repertoire for Godman and Romano, and has been used as a workshop composition for the Guildhall School of Music and Drama \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **Faraday Waves** 

 This project brought the sheer beauty of this classic physics experiment to broad, non\-specialist audiences, with figures in excess of 3,000 people. The first performance was at the prestigious Art & Science Days 2016 Concerts, Concours Bourges, a leading centre for the performance of electroacoustic music. Faraday Waves later toured five UK venues in 2016/17 as part of the *'Ritual in Transfigured Time'* tour \(Kate Romano and the Goldfield Ensemble\), for which Godman designed and coded a unique performance system \(total audience 735; funded by the Arts Council of England, RVW Trust and the Britten\-Peers Trust\). Audience feedback described “ *an extraordinary and powerful work…it makes so much more sense to hear and watch it live*”; “ *I have never really understood Varese until I heard it in this context*…” \[ **5.10**\]. After initial performances at these niche, prestigious electroacoustic venues, *Faraday Waves* reached entirely different audiences through festival appearances in Italy, Greenwich and Bath \(2017\-2018\), and more ‘mainstream’ music crowds in 2019 at the Noisily and WOMAD festivals \(physics pavilion, c.2,100 visitors\). 

 Educational impact was achieved through a tour of Cambridgeshire schools \(720 pupils\), which again went some way to removing the art/science division within learning and understanding. In this workshop, polyrhythms were demonstrated to children in KS1 and KS2 using hackable Scratch coding templates developed by Godman. Schools feedback stated: “ *the children and adults all absolutely loved the show and learnt so much too… \[it\] exceeded all expectations*”; “ *the children were buzzing…I’ve never seen them so animated*…” The Scratch template is available freely online; estimated take\-up 200 \[ **5.10**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Professor Dawn Archer specialises in deciphering how language is used to influence, manipulate and deceive. She has used her expertise to train more than 150 European Air Marshals, who protect in excess of 5,000,000 passengers passing through European airports each year. Training for 27 police negotiators has led to linguistic techniques being incorporated into their daily practice, and to the ongoing development of a language\-focused toolkit for current and future operational UK police negotiators. Her parliamentary work has led to her being consulted on the spelling of ‘anti\-Semitism’ in Lords Hansard Official Debates, bolstering their style guide practices. Her expertise has also been noted for influencing the conception and production of True Crime documentary programming. Her media appearances and press coverage have an estimated combined circulation of 981,828,907, exposing new audiences to an empirically validated understanding of the linguistic markers of deception and its detection. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In collaboration with the Emotional Intelligence Academy \(EIA\) Group, Archer’s work on deception and its detection is underpinned by the development of two empirically validated analysis systems for uncovering deception. SCAn\-R is a real\-time analysis system that considers cues across six verbal and non\-verbal communicative channels. SCAnS is a semi\-automated version of SCAn\-R that pioneers the use of corpus linguistic tools to make the analysis more reliable and effective. This work improves on current, predominantly psychological, models of deception detection by focusing on the combined power of linguistic, behavioural and physiological indices. By focusing on mismatches in what a speaker says, their baseline interactional style, and what their body language and other physiological signs communicate, users can identify persons of interest and then test the hypothesis that they are engaging in deception **\[1\]**. Prior to this work, the role of deceptive language had hardly been addressed at all, especially in contexts such as European airports, and no empirically validated tools for analysing suspects’ verbal output had been proposed. Archer and her colleagues introduced pioneering ways of using corpus linguistic tools \(where permissible\), in addition to improving upon currently available verbal elicitation techniques. Archer has demonstrated, for instance, how small talk can be employed as a covert elicitation technique to catch out suspected ‘persons of interest’ in airport contexts, while being perceived by genuine passengers as innocuous ‘chit\-chat’ **\[2\]**. 

 Archer’s work on crisis negotiation is underpinned by a set of original concepts, including the ‘reality paradigm’, which designates a whole range of cognitive filters through which we perceive and interpret the world **\[3\]**. Archer has demonstrated that by homing in on what subjects say and how they say it, negotiators can familiarise themselves with a subject’s reality paradigm, and hence more easily secure common ground by tailoring their own speech to the situation at hand. She has also demonstrated how pragmatic techniques can be employed by negotiators to deliver their message more effectively while, importantly, avoiding further conflict. For instance, she advocates the use of ‘face\-enhancing’ techniques, including the affirmation of subjects’ positive actions/decisions and honesty, and has demonstrated how such language builds rapport and trust in high\-stake crisis negotiation scenarios **\[4\]**. 

 Archer’s parliamentary work highlights the importance of linguistic analysis in formally describing how House of Lords and Commons speakers negotiate their political differences. She has introduced novel ways of combining linguistic analysis and corpus linguistic tools to uncover pragmatic phenomena in Hansard Official Debates and has demonstrated how such an approach can successfully disclose implicit meaning. Applying these methods, she has revealed, for instance, how speakers make subtle pragmatic choices, such as veiling their intended meaning in superficial politeness, and using impression management strategies to avoid being reprimanded and censored for using ‘unparliamentary language’, while clearly conveying their intentions nevertheless **\[5, 6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Keeping Airports Safe** 

  

 Archer’s collaboration with the EIA Group saw the development, delivery and evaluation of training for European Air Marshals and Behavioural Detection Officers \(BDOs\) as part of ARMLET \(2016 and 2017\), a pan\-European project that attracted a EUR1,600,000 grant from the EU’s ‘Prevention of and Fight Against Crime Programme’. Two cohorts of European Air Marshalls were trained in Romania to use the SCAn\-R system. The Training Coordinator for the ARMLET programme notes that this novel approach ‘significantly improved \[security personnel’s\] ability to analyse behaviour, making them more effective at their job, whilst also prioritising \(and maximising\) the safety’ of the ‘24,000 passengers/civilians that pass through \[the Romanian\] airport each day. In 2018 alone, this totalled 5,077,693 passengers’. The training was promoted ‘as a standard for training programs dedicated to Air Marshal and BDO operators’, and has since been ‘integrated \[...\] into current training and operations at the airport as well as work with Diplomatic partners’. In\-house trainers have subsequently instructed ‘an additional 116 Air Marshals/BDOs from seven EU member states’ in use of the SCAn\-R system. The Training Coordinator remarks that the airports that engaged with, and benefitted from, the guidance ‘now have a reliable internal procedure in place for helping people to detect suspicious behaviour’ **\[A\]**. The Managing Director of the EIA Group notes that, following SCAn\-R training, Air Marshals could ‘correctly identify persons of interest 87% of the time \- a significant increase from around 40% pre\-training’. The training also helped to ‘significantly reduce the false\-positive rate \[…\] resulting in better time and human resource management, reduced inconvenience to genuine passengers, and shorter wait times when going through security checks.’ The team have now been ‘approached by other European airport security agencies in Germany, France, Belgium and Poland’ and work is underway ‘to extend \[the\] training programme across Europe’ **\[B\]**. 

  

 **Changing Police Negotiator Practices** 

  

 Based on her work on negotiation and influence, Archer developed and delivered CPD training \(‘ *Negotiating Influence*’\) in 2016 for 27 locally\-based UK Police Negotiators. A senior representative of Greater Manchester’s Police’s \(GMP\) Hostage and Crisis Negotiation Unit \(HCNU\), states that, prior to this, ‘negotiator training had been based on a psychology\-driven approach of behavioural change’ and that Archer’s training ‘provided novel insight into how language can be used in crisis negotiation scenarios and was a welcome addition to standardised training’ **\[C\]**. Feedback obtained from a post\-training questionnaire indicated that the experienced negotiators taking part in the training viewed it as both innovative and valuable. Attendees indicated that ‘I was initially trained as a negotiator in 2005. I don’t recall any learning involving linguistics as part of our training. Most negotiator training revolves around psychology and behavioural interpretation not language in my view’ and that the guidance allowed them to develop ‘a deeper understanding about why \[subjects\] may be using’ the words and structures that they do **\[D\]**. This CPD work led to Archer’s ongoing collaboration with the National Negotiation Group \(NNG\), which includes the development of a ‘Police Negotiator’s Toolkit’ that prioritises linguistic techniques matched to specific incident\-types, such as barricades, sieges and suicide intervention. As the Assistant Commissioner for the Metropolitan Police notes, ‘it is the first time that training has been looked at and refreshed in this way for a long time’. The research conducted was judged to be ‘high\-quality, rigorous and scientifically based’. In a testimony, the Assistant Commissioner commends Professor Archer’s ‘genuine passion for negotiation, compassion for others and saving lives’ **\[E\]**. Comments from three focus groups \(based on the Report written for the NNG and prototype training materials\) were also especially positive. Contributors signalled the importance of being able ‘to apply some science to what we do, particularly if some things are shown to work better in different scenarios’. It was noted that ‘by having a better\-informed understanding of the nature of language and the way in which it can affect a subject's mood/belief/action’, negotiators ‘can be better prepared to negotiate more effectively’ **\[D\]**. 

  

 **Informing Government Record\-keeping Practices** 

  

 Archer’s Hansard\-related work attracted the attention of the Editor of Lords Hansard, John Vice, in 2017. Following a claim from a pressure group that certain variants of the contentious term ‘anti\-Semitism’ can legitimise ‘a form of pseudo\-scientific racial classification’, and hence ‘jeopardi\[se\] \[the\] political impartiality’ of Hansard, Vice deemed it ‘vital \[…\] to assess the validity of this claim and, if necessary, take action to correct it’. Archer was therefore asked, alongside PhD student Oliver Delgram\-Nejad, to determine the different connotations of eight variants based on frequency\-of\-use versus neutrality\-of\-use. The research used corpus linguistic techniques \(including determining the verbal ‘company’ each variant keeps in texts\) to analyse data taken from electronic news outlets, social media platforms, politically\-focused websites, and other sources. Vice notes that the ensuing report ‘enabled me to walk with some assurance this awkward and potentially fraught line between spelling and politics, and to push back against the lobby group with the knowledge that our current style is not obviously problematic. Her authoritative research was a crucial point of stability in a potentially fraught area’. Vice additionally noted that his ‘style guide team’ developed ‘a more mature awareness of the sensitivities of their decisions’. The Lords Hansard team was, therefore, confident to continue using its original formulation, with the additional bonus of gaining a fuller and more rounded understanding of the sensitivities and complexities involved. **\[F\]**. 

 **Engaging the Public and Influencing True Crime TV Production Practices** 

  

 Archer appears regularly on television as ‘the Listener’ on *Faking It: Tears of a Crime* \(Series 1\-4, 2017\-2020\) and has served as a communications expert on a three\-part Beverley Allitt special \( *The Beverley Allitt Tapes*\) *,* broadcast by Sky Crime \(02/08/2020\). She has also contributed widely to radio discussion of linguistics, most notably on BBC Radio 4’s *Word of Mouth.* Archer’s analysis for these popular programmes calls on her research insights based upon using linguistic and paralinguistic ‘points of interest’ from ‘multi\-channel’ communication, in order to identify possible deception in taped interviews with murder suspects and high\-profile subjects of legal action. During the latter part of 2020, Archer also contributed to a TV special, covering ‘Prince Andrew, Maxwell and Epstein’ for Discovery Plus UK, as well as two special editions of *Faking It*, covering ‘Saville’ and ‘Trump’. 

 Steve Anderson \(Shearwater Productions Ltd.\), producer of *Faking It*, notes that the first two\-part series ‘broke Investigation Discovery UK’s viewing records’ and that ‘Series 2 Episode 2 alone attracted 209,000 viewers’. Series 4 Episode 1 \(aired 12/09/2020\) attracted 280,137 viewers: it was also Quest Red’s most watched programme on replay \(on 14/09/2020\) **\[G\]**. Anderson states the following about Professor Archer’s role in the programme: 

 ‘As “The Listener”, her expertise was used to analyse the speech of those suspected of serious crimes \- predominantly murder. She studied videotapes and other footage of bogus appeals recorded by TV News bulletins to identify words, phrases and patterns in speech that may point to potential guilt. In doing so, she was able to introduce the public to complicated linguistic topics and explain them in accessible terms. Throughout the series, Professor Archer educated the public on how language can be used to identify dishonest people. The educational value was made clear by comments left across social media platforms. On Professor Archer’s Twitter account, for example, we can read the following: “It is a pleasure observing how you can infer lies from the audio tapes of criminal 

 interviews. I never noticed how significant pauses were until I watched your segment in 

 \#FakingIt …It is a case of not taking any…tone/words with a pinch of salt. Brilliant stuff”’ **\[G\]**. 

 Other social media commenters point out that they became aware of how significant pauses, tone and words can be, and that Archer’s guidance is ‘good to use every day’. A third indicated their plan to put into practice what they had learnt in their viewing by ‘testing \[it\] out \[…\] at school’ **\[H\]**. 

 Katie McDougall \(Woodcut Media\), producer of *The Beverley Allitt Tapes*, points out that ‘a large part of my concept \[...\] was to have a communication expert look at original interview recordings done under police caution’. She ‘became aware of Archer’s work having listened to her appearance on Radio 4’s *Word of Mouth*’ **\[I\]**. McDougall notes that Archer’s input ‘was invaluable’ and ‘helped shape my understanding of the language used by \[Allitt\]’. Furthermore, Archer ‘was able to go above and beyond’ in her analyses and ‘the amount of knowledge and additional content she brought to the project \[…\] influenced my approach to developing the concept for the screen and had a strong impact on how I went about filming the series’ **\[I\]**. Currently, cumulative viewing figures for *The Beverley Allitt Tapes* stand at 217,286 **.** As of 12/09/2020, Archer has appeared in programmes reaching an estimated 2,660,523 viewers \(excluding repeats\) to demonstrate how linguistic analysis can be put into practice to analyse the verbal behaviour of individuals suspected of deception **\[J\].** 

 Archer’s radio work includes appearing on BBC Radio 4’s *Word of Mouth* to discuss the linguistic indicators of lying, as well as appearances on BBC Radio Leeds and BBC Radio Merseyside to discuss linguistic deception associated with specific crimes/locations. Archer’s appearance on *Word of Mouth* stemmed from the producers being ‘particularly interested in \[Archer’s\] work on lying’, having ‘really enjoyed \[her\] contribution on *Faking It: Tears of a Crime*’ **\[K\].** *Word of Mouth: Lying,* alone, reached an estimated 6,560,000 listeners **\[J\]**. Because ‘the response to the programme \[was\] fantastic’, Archer was subsequently commissioned to write a feature that *Word of Mouth* used to ‘promote the programme heavily’ **\[K\]**. Archer’s work has also featured in magazine and newspaper articles where she has been asked to comment on deceptive language more generally. As of 12/09/2020, these articles had an aggregated potential circulation of 971,621,383 **\[J\].**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A theoretical model of firesetting developed by Professor Theresa Gannon and colleagues at Kent led to the creation and implementation of novel assessment and treatment protocols for firesetters.  This has been used internationally from August 2013 onwards across a range of contexts, including high\-security psychiatric settings such as Broadmoor Hospital. Users report that the programme is ‘incredibly helpful for enabling patients to move forward in their care pathway’  **\[b\]**, as well as in discharge **\[c\]** and security\-level decision\-making **\[d\]**. Approximately 500 professionals working in hospitals, prisons, fire rescue services, and probation are now fully trained in the protocol across 13 countries, including the UK, USA, Australia, Germany, and Japan. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 With the aid of a major grant awarded by the ESRC \( **2011\-14**\) **\[G1\]**, Professor Theresa Gannon and colleagues from the University of Kent generated ground\-breaking advances in understanding firesetting: a devastating and intractable crime that costs the UK over £50 million each week. Their controlled study on clinical treatment needs demonstrated that firesetters have unique psychological characteristics compared to other types of offenders and pointed to fire\-specific and general psychological factors that should be targeted in order to reduce firesetting behaviour **\[R6\]**. From this research programme, the team developed the *Multi\-Trajectory Theory of Adult Firesetting* \(M\-TTAF\). The M\-TTAF proposes five causal pathways to offending, characterised by either excessive interest in fires, antisocial cognition, grievance, the need for recognition/expression of emotion, or a combination of both excessive interest in fire and antisocial cognition **\[R5\]**. 

 The M\-TTAF provides professionals with a new way of conceptualising the cluster of motivations and risk factors associated with firesetting and forms the basis of the first\-ever dedicated assessment and treatment protocols for practitioners working in correctional, probation, or mental health settings. The two programmes, *Firesetting Intervention Programme for Mentally Disordered Offenders* \(FIP\-MO\) **\[R1, R4\]** and *Firesetting Intervention Programme for Prisoners* \(FIPP\) **\[R2\]**, were developed by Professor Gannon between **2011** and **2014**. The Four Factor Fire Scale assessment protocol that also informs the programme was developed by Dr Caoilte Ó Ciardha and colleagues at Kent **\[R3\]**. It provides practitioners with an assessment of fire\-related constructs, which is easy to administer and score. It also provides practitioners with data norms for male prisoners, male young offenders, and male and female mentally disordered offenders, which enables the practitioner to evaluate accurately whether their client holds, for example, problematic fire interest or fire safety views that require intervention. 

 This research project was hosted by the Centre for Research and Education in Forensic Psychology \(CORE\-FP\). The team also includes Dr Caoilte Ó Ciardha and Dr Emma Alleyne, plus past and present Kent research staff and PhD students, including Dr Magali Barnoux, Dr Helen Butler, Dr Nichola Tyler, Dr Katarina Mozova, and Katie Sambrooks, as well as a team of NHS collaborators headed by Dr Lona Lockerbie \(Service Director, KMPT, UK\). The underpinning research and its impact beyond academia to date have led to Gannon and colleagues being nominated for, and winning, multiple awards. These include a team nomination for the international Grawemeyer ‘Best Idea in Psychology’ Award in **2019** and receiving the ESRC Outstanding Impact in Society Award in **2016** **\[G2\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 As the first evidence\-based and dedicated treatment and assessment programmes for firesetters, the *Firesetting Intervention Programme for Mentally Disordered Offenders* \(FIP\-MO\) **\[a\]** and *Firesetting Intervention Programme for Prisoners* \(FIPP\) **\[b\]** have been implemented internationally across a range of settings since **August 2013**, including within high\-security institutions.  Firesetting is a type of criminal activity that often results in offenders becoming stuck in custodial settings for extended periods because of the high risks associated with release. Access to effective assessment and treatment protocols allows practitioners to help participants progress along care or rehabilitation pathways. This case study evidences the following between **August 2013** and **December 2020**: 

-  The reach of the FIP\-MO and FIPP programmes, as evidenced by the number of professionals participating in the commercial training programme worldwide; 

-  The significance of implementing the FIP\-MO or FIPP for organisations involved in assessing and treating firesetters, as evidenced by statements from selected institutions. 

 **International Reach of FIP\-MO and FIPP** 

 In brief, training on how to use the two programmes has been delivered commercially to around 500 practitioners in the REF2021 period \(despite being halted in March 2020 because of COVID\-19\) and includes the following **\[f\]**: 

-  All three high\-security NHS psychiatric hospitals in the UK \(i.e. Broadmoor Hospital, Rampton Hospital, Ashworth Hospital\) 

-  50 medium\-secure UK hospitals 

-  15 UK prisons 

 Fully trained practitioners now include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, occupational therapists, nurses, social workers, and fire service professionals. A total of 31 English, Welsh, and Scottish fire and rescue services also commissioned specialist training on how to approach the assessment and treatment of adults. This included a dedicated session for London Fire Chiefs in **March 2019 \[f\]**. 

 Professionals in 12 other countries, including the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Singapore, have also participated since **August 2013,** with the treatment manuals translated into Portuguese and Japanese **\[f\]**. 

 **Significance of FIP\-MO and FIPP in Assessing and Treating Firesetting** 

 As statements from some of the trained practitioners demonstrate, implementing the programme has helped aid decisions regarding leave, security levels, as well as discharge or release for those exhibiting high\-risk firesetting behaviours. 

 A cohort of staff from Broadmoor Hospital attended FIP\-MO training as participants in the original research phase \(early 2013\) and have since adopted FIP\-MO as their standard treatment for firesetting. As Broadmoor’s Head of Psychological Services stated in October 2020, implementing FIP\-MO over the intervening seven years has proved an important development in addressing this dangerous and intractable form of offending: 

 ‘Having an evidence\-based treatment model for patients at our service has been incredibly helpful for enabling patients to move forward in their care pathway. The treatment model is one of the only evidence\-based treatment models available in forensic mental health services internationally \(see Mallion, Tyler, & Miles, 2020\). It is for this reason that Broadmoor Hospital has adopted the FIP\-MO treatment model as the treatment of choice for use with patients who have set deliberate fires’ **\[c\]**. 

 A statement from Secure Services at the NHS Essex Partnership University Foundation Trust \(which adopted the programme after receiving training in **2017**\) illustrated the benefits of the programme in psychiatric settings: 

 ‘The FIP\-MO treatment is particularly useful when we are seeking to discharge people to the community. This is because we can demonstrate that these people have engaged in a structured intervention for firesetting, that teaches them the skills to cope with life in a more positive way rather than using firesetting.  Previously, trying to find accommodation for discharged individuals with a firesetting offence in their background was almost impossible. However, using the FIP\-MO provides both us and accommodation placements with evidence\-based and safer decision\-making in this regard’ **\[d\]**. 

 A further statement from the CPD Board Chair of the Psychological Services team at HM Prison and Probation Service, which trained 36 staff to deliver the programme on either **20/3/2017** or **25/10/2018**, confirmed similar successful outcomes in prison settings. These are described in the collated feedback by training participants, which includes a selection of specific case studies: 

 ‘An adult male serving a life sentence. The index offence involved starting a house fire in his local neighbourhood, which led to the death of one of the inhabitants. In addition to the index offence, there was a history of 2 fires started with prison \[…\]. The flexibility of the FIPP enabled the firesetting to be explored alongside the other risk taking behaviours that he had engaged in. During the programme he decided to engage in methadone withdrawal, at the beginning of the programme he had been stable on the prescription he received and had not felt that he could achieve withdrawal while in custody \[…\]. At the end of the programme, the formulation and recommendations for future risk management were shared with professionals supporting the client in future, and were reported as valuable additional information \[…\]. He was able to describe how fire and other risk taking behaviours had served a particular function for him, and to acknowledge that not setting fires in future \(which he was resolved to do\) would be a loss for him. This enabled replacement activities to be discussed which might provide reward for him’ **\[e – Response 7, case 2\]**. 

 ‘\[…\] the service user made significant progress. This included increasing his insight into how his difficulties with coping and interest in fire had contributed to a range of firesetting offences. \[…\] since completion of FIPP, he has progressed to lower secure conditions and has been referred to a therapeutic environment to support him further’ **\[e – Response 9\].** 

 One US\-based licensed psychologist at FirePsych Inc. confirmed that he has conducted 50 assessments since completing the training in **January 2019**, which have facilitated ‘safe placement transitions and the delivery of needed supports and services’ **\[g\]**. He further reported that the State of Connecticut’s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services ‘initiated a two\-year plan to develop assessment and treatment capacity at their two largest state inpatient hospitals. Team members have begun completing assessments and delivering treatments to inpatient adults, some of whom have remained hospitalized for firesetting events occurring decades earlier’ **\[g\]**. 

 A psychologist from Forensicare, a community forensic mental health service in Melbourne, Australia, reported: 

 ‘As \(FIP\-MO\) is the only validated treatment program available in Australia, it has been a useful tool for ensuring that the relevant risk/needs areas are covered, while allowing flexibility to treat some of the other needs we typically see in our treatment cohort \(i.e. personality disorder or complex comorbidities\). When training new staff on firesetting, I direct them both to the treatment program and the M\-TTAF as a starting point for developing skills in this area’ **\[h\]**. 

 In **2018**, the training programme was judged by the British Psychological Society to meet the professional standards required for publication in their approved CPD catalogue **\[i\]**. It also won the ESRC Outstanding Impact on Society Award in **2016** and was shortlisted for the Criminal Justice Alliance Award in **2017** **\[G2\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Professor Zdenek Zdrahal** and **Dr Martin Hlosta’s** pioneering research in Predictive Learning Analytics has developed new tools which successfully improve higher education student retention, by providing an early warning when students are at risk of failing or abandoning their studies. These tools have reduced from 37% to 19%, the average drop\-out rate for first\-year students at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague, thus saving 422 students from abandoning their studies and preventing the faculty from losing close to GBP1 million in government funding. **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta’s** work has also improved professional practice, student outcomes and retention rates at The Open University. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Students dropping out of higher education is a critical problem for the sector, especially for distance education institutions. If universities fail to identify and support those students at risk of abandoning their studies, they risk wasting talent. As tuition fees and funding associated with student numbers are vitally important to universities, reducing drop\-out rates is also a financial imperative. Since 2011, Professor Zdenek **Zdrahal** and Dr Martin **Hlosta** have investigated how to use students’ data to discover their learning patterns and predict their likelihood of experiencing difficulties. This work on Predictive Learning Analytics offers institutions an early warning system to develop support strategies which deliver timely, effective and meaningful support to students. 

 In a 2015 article, **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** explored how machine learning techniques can predict students’ success or failure **\[O1\]**. The researchers collected a sample of Open University students’ tutor\-marked assignments, weekly interactions through the virtual learning environments and their demographic information. They then used the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance algorithm to select most predictive features and generated multiple models for prediction of students’ weekly performance. Finally, **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** applied the Majority Voting Algorithm to the results of this modelling to create a final forecast of expected student performance in the next assignment. Evaluation of these predictions demonstrated that the approach could identify at\-risk students early in the module. It also indicated that the predictive model’s performance increases as it collects more data. This approach to predict short\-term milestones is distinct from other proposals in the literature. In particular, it allows tutors to monitor student learning continuously and set the most appropriate short\-term goals. 

 Concurrently with this analysis of Open University student performance, the researchers explored how to transfer their proven predictive framework from distance learning to classroom\-based university education at Czech Technical University in Prague. **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** used student data from previous years to build a probabilistic model to predict, for each week, the probability of student success based on the number of credits the student earned to date. Their 2016 formal evaluation of this StudentAnalyse system confirmed its predictive ability **\[O2\]**. In particular, this research demonstrated the importance of planning interventions before the Christmas break to prevent students from dropping out in the following semesters. 

 In a 2017 article, **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** tackled the problem of predicting student performance in new modules, which lack legacy data, by applying their self\-learning model to data about the students’ first submission for the module in question **\[O3\]**. In a subsequent publication the same year, the researchers improved this approach by incorporating a problem\-based sampling method, which they also generalised to enable the more detailed prediction of students’ achievement of specific learning goals within a set deadline **\[O4\]**. 

 In the 2015/2016 academic year, **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** developed a pilot platform based on their research that Open University tutors could use to monitor students’ performance. Their formal evaluation of this OUAnalyse dashboard, published in 2019, evidenced that tutors’ increased use of the platform resulted in higher student pass rates **\[O5\]**. These results confirmed the value of the approach and paved the way for deployment at scale within The Open University.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** have applied solutions derived from their research **\[O1\-O5\]** on Predictive Learning Analytics in two real\-world organisational settings, to improve student retention at the Czech Technical University in Prague and The Open University. 

 **Improving student retention at the Czech Technical University** 

 In the 2015/16 academic year, the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Czech Technical University in Prague \(FME\-CTU\) invited the researchers to deploy the StudentAnalyse system **\[O1, O2\]** to address its historically high first\-year drop\-out rate average of 37% **\[C1\]**. After using the system to identify key student milestones and at\-risk students and applying relevant intervention strategies based on the system’s data, FME\-CTU tutors have reduced this failure rate to an average of 19% between 2015/16 and 2018/19. As a result, 422 additional students have advanced to second and third\-year study **\[C1\]**. In a November 2020 letter, the Vice\-Dean for Education at FME\-CTU states that the system’s success in the early identification of at\-risk students had enhanced the “ *general wellbeing prospects for affected students*” and the institution **\[C1\]**. Each year, the Czech Ministry of Education grants funding to the Czech Technical University on the basis of the overall number of students. In his letter, the Vice\-Dean explains that the improved student retention delivered by StudentAnalyse for the four academic years, from 2015/16 to 2018/19, has resulted in a total additional financial income of CZK27,900,000 **\[C1\]**. Converted at the average exchange rate during these years, this corresponds to approximately GBP950,000. 

 StudentAnalyse also provided additional benefits to FME\-CTU during its response to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. The Vice\-Dean noted that the faculty was able to deploy learning strategies proven successful by the system since 2015/16, “ *to move to fully online teaching by redesigning the exam strategy for the whole undergraduate programme*” **\[C1\]**. As a result, they explained, all of the faculty’s 2,251 students continued to receive “ *all essential educational functions with the maximum possible care for the health and safety of both students and staff*” **\[C1\]**. 

 **Improving professional practice, student outcomes and retention rates at The Open University** 

 Improving student retention is a critical strategic priority for The Open University \(OU\). As a distance teaching institution, the university has historically suffered from higher\-than\-average drop\-out rates. In the five academic years to 2015/16, an average of 30% of students abandoned their studies in the first year, 20% more than the average among UK higher education institutions **\[C2\]**. Since 2015, **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** have piloted predictive learning analytics solutions to this problem, based on their research **\[O1\-O4\]**. The product of these pilots, the OUAnalyse platform **\[O5\]**, has had demonstrable success in three critical ways: 

1.  OUAnalyse usage by tutors is now one of the two significant predictors of whether students will complete and pass a course, alongside previous best score. 

1.  Teachers who regularly access the student performance platform have better student retention rates. Those who use it at least 41% of the time have average student retention of 56%, compared to 48% for those who do either limited or no use of the platform. 

1.  Teachers had better student outcomes in the years they used OUAnalyse than in previous years **\[C2\]**. 

 In a November 2020 letter, The Open University’s Director for Students explained how, in April 2019, this evidence “ *led the university internal review panel to recommend using Predictive Learning Analytics in all faculties*” **\[C2\]**. They also described how, as a result of this decision, from November 2020 “ *all of the OU’s 3,581 tutors in the undergraduate modules have been given training materials on how to use OUAnalyse directly in their primary teaching portal \- TutorHome. As such, Learning Analytics and monitoring students’ progress using OUAnalyse has become part of teaching for 118,963 students*” **\[C2\]**. 

 Interviews with tutors also reveal that using OUAnalyse complements existing teaching practices. In feedback collected by email in December 2019, Open University tutors wrote that the system is “ *the best method*” for monitoring student performance they have worked with and provides an efficient way “ *to work out if there may be potential problems*” **\[C3**, p.2 **\]**. Others explained that OUAnalyse “ *pushed*” them to monitor and contact struggling students more quickly than they usually would. One tutor, who explained they had a particularly challenging group, said that without OUAnalyse, they “ *would have lost around four or five of them, but all of them made it ‘til the end and passed*” **\[C3**, p.2 and p.3 **\]**. 

 In its 2016 report, From Bricks to Clicks, which includes an entire case study about the use of OUAnalyse at The Open University, the UK House of Lords’ Higher Education Commission pointed out that “ *apart from the OU the Commission does not believe that any UK institution has made significant headway in this area*” **\[C4**, p.53 **\]**. Finally, in September 2020, the DataIQ Awards recognised OUAnalyse by awarding the prize for ‘Best use of data by a not\-for\-profit organisation’ **\[C5\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Equestrian sports, horseracing and leisure riding are popular worldwide. Water treadmill and physiotherapy interventions are increasingly being used within sport horse management to maintain musculoskeletal health, increasing competitive success and extending career longevity, however little standard guidance exists to inform their effective use. Research at Hartpury combined with over 15 years of practice, have been combined to develop evidence\-based standards and guidance, which are informing industry practice. The standards and guidance are endorsed and promoted by international governing bodies for therapists and equestrian sports in the UK, and across the world. The application of this research has improved outcomes for equine athletes within British Equestrian’s World\-Class Programme leading to Olympic medal success, and informs the training of hundreds of sport horses and racehorses worldwide on a daily basis. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Hartpury’s Equine Therapy Centre has a long\-standing reputation for providing high quality training and rehabilitation of sport and race horses and implementing innovative approaches that advance sector practice, in the UK and internationally. This case study identifies two areas of research, which have had a direct impact on guidance and practice: the use of water treadmill exercise and application of objective measures in veterinary physiotherapy within sport and racehorse management and training. 

 **2.1 Equine Water Treadmill practice** 

 Worldwide, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of equine water treadmills within the last 25 years but a global understanding of good practice guiding usage has been lacking. Hartpury installed the UK’s first ‘ground level’ water treadmill in 1999. This unique design allowed the user to alter water depth within and between exercise sessions, which provided flexibility in designing and researching potential benefits of exercise protocols to improve sport horse performance and rehabilitation outcomes. Drawing on experience and research, Dr Nankervis and colleagues developed internal best practice guidelines that were implemented successfully across elite sport and racehorse clients, including within the training programmes of GBR Olympic Gold medallists in individual and team dressage prior to the London 2012 and Rio 2016 games. 

 An international survey was funded by the British Equestrian Federation’s UK Sport Lottery supported World Class Programme to identify how existing users were employing water treadmill exercise for training and rehabilitation of sport horses. The results revealed a high number of relatively ‘new’ venues offering water treadmill exercise commercially, over a third of venues had less than 12 months experience with no formal training available for water treadmill operators \[3.1\]. The research also found that new users tended to experiment with the full capabilities of their water treadmills, combining high water with high speed \[3.1\], often with an incline. The research findings recognised this practice would be, at best, unlikely to improve performance and could actually lead to unnecessary injury. An urgent need for the development and dissemination of best practice guidelines for water treadmill use was therefore evident. 

 The next step was a detailed study looking closely at differing practice. It compared the range of movement of the forelimbs and hindlimbs on a normal treadmill at 1.6 m/s with a water treadmill at 0.8 m/s \(i.e. ‘slow’ treadmill belt speed\) \[3.2\]. This study showed significant decreases in forelimb range of movement and significant increases in hindlimb range of movement as water depth increased. The range of movement of the forelimb on the water treadmill was significantly lower, and the range of movement of the hindlimb was significantly higher than on the normal treadmill. This information supported the need to exercise horses more slowly in water than at typical speeds used overland, to minimise the effects of drag on the forelimb and maximise the potential benefits for increased range of movement of the hindlimb \[3.2\]. This evidence established that ‘ *slow*’ exercise on water treadmills was beneficial for performance. 

 A further empirical study examined the effects of water depth on the movement of the back \[3.3\]. This study showed that water at a depth of the horse’s knee \(i.e., ‘ *low*’\) was optimal for gaining lumbar flexion \(desirable in sport horses\) whilst avoiding extension in the thoracic spine \(undesirable in sport horses\). The conclusion was that high water \(i.e., water above the level of the horse’s knee\) should be avoided for horses with ‘kissing spines’, a common back disorder in sport horses. The final step towards producing best practice guidelines was a review collating existing evidence \[3.4\], including findings from 3.2 and 3.3, to inform recommendations for the effective use of both treadmills and water treadmills within the training and rehabilitation of sport horses. In response to industry need \[3.1\] the ‘Equine Water Treadmill Exercise: A Guide for Users’ was released in 2020, which was informed by the existing evidence base \[3.2, 3.3\] and supported by experience in practice \[3.4\]. 

 **2.2 Outcome measures for Equine rehabilitation** 

 Physiotherapy professional standards of practice state clinical reasoning and evidence\-based practice should be used when selecting appropriate measures and tests for the assessment of neuro\-musculoskeletal health, to promote sports performance, prevent injury, and to assess progress in rehabilitation programmes. In animal physiotherapy, no guidelines were available to assist practitioners with this approach in their practice. 

 Building on the approach used to develop the water treadmill guidelines, the Equestrian Performance Research Centre has led research to develop evidence\-informed physiotherapy practice for use in the management and rehabilitation of sport and racehorses. To assess athlete status, physiotherapists should use objective, standardised and validated outcome measures. We surveyed animal physiotherapists to see if this approach was implemented in their practice in sport and leisure horses, and dogs. The results found this was not the case and that practitioners often used subjective assessment methods and outcome measures. We identified that limited outcome measures existed, which are time\-efficient, inexpensive, and easy to use in practice and an urgent need for the development of clinical guidelines to support practice \[3.5\]. 

  

 To understand what was required from the equine physiotherapy and rehabilitation industry specifically, consensus was gathered from experienced practitioners actively engaged in the management of sport horse health and performance across the world, including veterinarians, physiotherapists and equine researchers using a Delphi process \[3.6\]. This process agreed areas of assessment deemed essential to include in individual outcome measures, providing a basis for clinical assessment guidelines for horses and dogs engaged in sport. The reliability and validity of specific outcome measures have been supported by further studies undertaken at Hartpury.  In 2020, this body of work underpinned the production of equine and canine assessment clinical guidelines validated by the Association of Chartered Physical and Animal Therapists \(ACPAT\) for use in practice, in competitive and companion animals.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Hartpury’s research presented in this case study has had a positive impact on the management and training of sport and race horses in three ways: developing best practice across industry, promoting success in equestrian sport, and through education and research\-led teaching. 

 **4.1 Developing best practice** 

 *Equine water treadmill practice:* Hartpury combined with national and international partners from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, North America and China to establish The Hydrotherapy Working Group in 2019. The group consists of researchers, commercial equine hydrotherapy centres, equine veterinary surgeons and physiotherapists from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, North America and China. This group developed guidelines for water treadmill use, underpinned by Hartpury research, ‘Equine Water Treadmill Exercise – A Guide for Users’ with Nankervis as corresponding author \[5.1\]. These guidelines detail how water treadmills should, and should not be used, in the management and rehabilitation of sport horses. The guidelines are endorsed by British Equestrian and inform the use of water treadmills for horses on the British Equestrian World Class Programme \[5.2\], as well as being adopted as standard practice across equine therapy centres around the world \[5.3\]. 

 In 2020, the Institute of Registered Veterinary and Animal Physiotherapists established an ‘Institute of Equine Hydrotherapists’ to set the standards for professionalism and clinical proficiency in equine hydrotherapy. The Institute advocate the use of the Hartpury guidelines as standard practice across the industry \[5.3\]. Practitioners recognise the value of applying our research\-informed approach to their own practice, and use this the research to design protocols based on the ‘ *low and slow’* methodology to generate a positive impact on horse health, performance and welfare \[5.3\]: 

 “*The research work has helped me educate staff with clear procedure guidelines, avoiding unnecessary injuries and getting the best results I can for my horses.*” 

 Grainne Ni Chaba\-Byrne, Chair of the Institute of Equine Hydrotherapists \[5.4\]. 

 Additionally the research \[3.1\-3.4\] has been used to advise individual water treadmill users including leading racehorse trainers \(e.g. Lucinda Russell\), sports horse rehabilitation centres \(e.g. Ivy Lodge, Northern Ireland and AK Equestrian, Netherlands\), and major sport and race horse training venues \(e.g. Conghua Training and Rehabilitation Centre, China\). The research has also positively influenced how water treadmill manufacturers \(Idots Aquatrainer, FMBs Therapy Systems, ECB Equine, Aqua Equine Treadmill Ltd.\) support their clients to apply an evidence\-informed approach to water treadmill use in practice: 

 *“Our commercial customers are putting between 8 and 22 horses through their treadmills daily. The research work has helped my customers use their machines more effectively and safely. The ‘Guide for Users’ researched and published by Dr Kathryn Nankervis and Hartpury is included now in our handbook for all our customers.”* 

 \(Serena Hickson, Managing Director FMBs Therapy systems \[5.5\]\). 

 *Supporting clinicians \(veterinary surgeons and animal physiotherapists\) in the management of sport and race horses:* The research on outcomes measures has been used to assist veterinary surgeons’ clinical decision\-making informally individually, and formally via British Equine Veterinary Association CPD \[5.3\]. The equine water treadmill guidelines were also circulated to all UK equine veterinary surgeons via the British Equine Veterinary Association website to inform referral, and are supported by leading clinicians who use these with clients to enhance performance and within rehabilitation \[5.3\]. The video abstract for paper 3.3, explaining why high water should not be used for horses with back pain, or for dressage horses, is the most frequently viewed Equine Veterinary Journal video abstract:   [https://vimeo.com/267791535](https://vimeo.com/267791535) \(over 2,500 views\). 

 *Evidence\-based Assessment Guidelines for Equine Physiotherapy* **:** In 2020, a working group consisting of experts from ACPAT and Hartpury researchers \(Tabor and Allen\) compiled physiotherapy clinical guidelines based on current best practice evidence and Hartpury research for use in the assessment of neuromuscular health and performance in horses and dogs. The UK national professional group for animal physiotherapists, ACPAT, recommend that the clinical guidelines are adopted in practice by all those involved in musculoskeletal care of sporting, leisure and companion animals including physiotherapists, veterinary surgeons and therapists \[5.6\]. The guidelines and underpinning studies have been disseminated via publications and meetings to international physiotherapy practitioner groups including the Danish and the Canadian Physiotherapy groups and the Australian Physiotherapy Association Animal group \[5.7\]. 

 **4.2 Supporting Olympic Success in Equestrian Sport** 

 The *‘low and slow’* water treadmill exercise protocol used within the Equine Therapy Centre at Hartpury University underpins professional practice in the Centre. In this REF period, hundreds of sport and race horses have been cared for using this protocol resulting in successful return to competition post injury and improved competitive success. In 2014, having achieved a World Record score of 94.3%, Charlotte Dujardin attributed her horse Valegro’s fitness to twice weekly water treadmill sessions within the Equine Therapy Centre at Hartpury University \[5.2\]. The ‘ *low and slow’* protocol we advocate has been applied to the training programmes of British, Irish, and Italian team horses, across dressage and eventing within Hartpury’s Equine Therapy Centre, including that of Valegro, winner of Olympic Gold in Individual dressage in Rio 2016. The value of this contribution is recognised by British Equestrian \[5.3\]: 

 *“The protocols developed as a result of work done by Hartpury University have been of great value in the training of horses on our Podium and Podium Potential Pathways, particularly in the preparation for major international competition, including those aiming for the Tokyo Olympics”.* 

 \(Dr Robert Oulton, British Equestrian Squad Veterinarian \[5.8\]\). 

 The much\-publicised use of Hartpury’s water treadmill enhancing performance within the GBR Dressage gold medal horses \[5.6\], stimulated widespread uptake of water treadmill exercise for training of elite dressage horses and wider equestrian disciplines: 

 *“The equine water treadmill industry has grown 10\-fold over the last 5\-6 years. I truly believe this is down to new research coming out proving that water treadmills are not only a tool to be used for rehabilitation work post injury but also are very effective to support training with horses and ponies from many disciplines improving performance”* 

 \(Serena Hickson of FMBs Therapy Systems \[5.5\)\]. 

 **4.3 Education and research\-led training** 

 Hartpury University is one of only two universities that runs an MSc programme for Chartered Physiotherapists who want to qualify as an animal physiotherapist, accredited by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists. Successful completion enables registration as a professional practitioner with ACPAT and the Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners. The research presented across this case study is embedded into delivery, supporting the development of sound clinical reasoning and best practice approaches in equine therapy and rehabilitation, which students take with them into professional practice \[5.9\]. It is also integrated into animal and equine programmes across Level 3 to 7 \(28 programmes; \~ 1000 students\), enabling these students to enter the equestrian industry with a foundation of best practice in the management and training of sport and race horses. Our research also underpins equine hydrotherapy training courses around the world \[5.10\]: 

 *“Based on the studies that Dr Nankervis conducted, we created an underwater treadmill course \(the Aquatrainer Academy\) for professional horse people in the Netherlands. The goals of this course are to increase the quality of the exercise on the treadmill, decrease the risks and increase the welfare of the horse”.*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Antibiotic resistant \(AMR\) pathogens are responsible for millions of hard\-to\-treat, hospital\-acquired infections \- 1.7 million in the US and 2.6 million in Europe \- that are often fatal. Severe or high\-risk multi\-drug resistant infections are currently treated by carbapenem antibiotics as drugs of last resort, but resistance to these drugs is escalating rapidly. The impact of Livermore’s research is: \(i\) contributing to the development of novel alternative antibiotic candidates to replace antibiotics of last resort such as carbapenems, including two that are now approved and in clinical use \(2020\) on a global stage; \(ii\) the design of bespoke individual antibiotic regimes which have informed practitioners and both enhanced and saved the lives of patients with life threatening infections; \(iii\) the implementation of a toolkit to reduce carbapenem resistant infections in UK hospitals by improving infection control procedures and policies in the health care sector across the UK. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Antimicrobial resistance \(AMR\) is a major threat to global health, reducing treatment options and recovery, and with annual death rates in excess of 99,000 \(USA\) and 37,000 \(Europe\). Until the turn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, carbapenem antibiotics were a ‘ **last resort’** drug used to treat AMR Gram\-negative pathogens that cause serious, hard to treat infections. However, as global levels of AMR infections increased significantly there has been a transition to the use of carbapenems as **first\-line** treatment options. This has led to the emergence of dangerous carbapenem resistant pathogens, which are extremely difficult to treat. **Livermore’s** research has mapped the global emergence of resistance mediated by plasmids encoding carbapenemase genes. **Livermore** discovered how microbes that employ carbapenemase enzyme to break down carbapenem antibiotics are spreading these carbapenemase resistance genes on a global stage, including the Indian Subcontinent, Europe and the UK. The spread of carbapenem resistance poses a significant challenge to vulnerable hospitalised patients and to the first\-line antibiotic treatments being used \( **3.1**\). Understanding the mechanism and dynamics of AMR spread is a critical first step in the design and delivery of prospective new antibiotic therapies, enabling pharmaceutical companies to decide which new candidate should be prioritised in clinical trials. In December 2019, there were 41 new antibiotic candidates in this Global Antibiotic Drug Discovery Pipeline, including some novel combination drug therapies with carbapenems. **Livermore** has performed *in vitro* antibiotic resistance analysis on nine novel antibiotic candidates or novel drug combinations currently either under development or under license by six different, international, pharmaceutical companies. These candidates represent new treatment options after all other treatment options have failed: drugs of last resort. These international pharmaceutical companies include, Merck & Co. Inc, Shionogi & Co. Ltd, & Wockhardt Ltd that are discussed in detail in Section 4 \( **3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5**\). 

 Between 2011\-18 **Livermore**, was seconded to Public Health England \(PHE\), for 1.5 days per week \(2013\-2018 >GBP186,000 to UEA\) to chair the weekly surveillance meetings for bacterial pathogens sent in by English hospitals. In 2013 this role led, to a key epidemiological surveillance review that assessed global levels of AMR including carbapenem resistance in Gram\-negative pathogens \( **3.1**\). The conclusion of the research was that there were limited treatment options and a paucity of new drugs in the Antibiotic Drug Discovery Pipeline. Therefore, infection control had to become a primary mechanism for combatting AMR. In 2014 **Livermore** was part of an expert group that developed a set of recommendations and a toolkit for English hospitals to combat AMR by improving infection control and reducing levels of antimicrobial prescribing in a secondary care setting to preserve the efficacy of Carbapenems to treat infections \( **3.6**\). 

 **Livermore’s** significant contributions to the study of AMR both nationally and internationally is evidenced by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy \(BSAC\) Garrod Medal in 2018, the highest honour afforded by the Society. Livermore was listed among Clarivate Analytics most Highly Cited Researcher in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Livermore's** research has led to both the generation of new antibiotics and treatment options, as well as the adoption of measures to prevent the spread of AMR infections in secondary care settings. This has been of benefit to pharmaceutical companies, medical practitioners treating patients with life threatening infections, hospital management who manage the treatment of patients with life threatening infections in secondary care settings, as well as the patients with antibiotic resistance infections. 

 <ins> **Discovering New Antibiotics and Treatment Options**</ins> 

 **Impact on Industry Practice** 

 Two drug candidates, for which **Livermore** performed and published *in vitro* analysis \( **3.2, 3.3**\) have recently been approved for clinical use \(Fetroja \(Cefiderocol \- Shionogi ltd\) and Recarbio \(MK7655 with imipenem \- Merck & Co. Inc\)\). These two drugs represent a significant breakthrough for previously untreatable urinary tract and hospital\-acquired bacterial pneumonia, and ventilator\-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by highly resistant gram\-negative pathogens. Both drugs are considered as drugs of last resort \( **5.1**, **5.2**\). Fetroja \(Shionogi ltd\) is the first new treatment which provides coverage against all Gram\-negative pathogens considered of critical priority by the World Health Organization. It was given FDA approval in the US in 2019 \(> USD10,000 treatment course\) and European Union Approval for use in 2020 \( **5.2**\).  Recarbrio \(Merck & Co. Inc\) \(> USD7,000 treatment course\) has been designed for use in patients aged 18 and above with limited or no alternative therapies \( **5.2**\). The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use – part of the European Medicine Agency\- that grants approval to new drugs stated that for the drugs Recarbrio and Fetroja \( **5.2**\) *:* 

 *“Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit\-risk balance of \[…\] is favourable in the following indication; Treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram\-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options*.”  European Agency Assessment report for Recarbrio \(pg. 277\) and Fetroja \(pg. 155\) \( **5.2**\). 

 Two other candidates analysed by **Livermore** are in Phase 2 trials including WCK4282 \( **3.5**\) \(a high dose combination of cefepime\-tazobactam\) and WCK6777 \(ertapenem\-zidebactam\) produced by Wockhardt.  Emphasising **Livermore’s** role, The Chief Scientific Officer of Wockhardt states: 

 “*Dr Livermore’s work has provided independent, valuable scientific evidence for substantiating the unmet need addressed by Wockhardt’s three antibiotics \[WCK4282* \( **3.2**\) **,** *WCK6777, WCK5222* \( **3.4**\) *\] that target Gram\-negative pathogens*” and “ *we recognise that Prof Livermore is a world\-renowned expert in this area and our collaborations have been extremely fruitful and together we have made great progress in our hunt for new antibiotic drugs to tackle the unmet need of antimicrobial resistance and the growing need for new drugs*” \( **5.3**\). 

 Wockhardt’s investment in AMR is the largest program anywhere in the world. 'Wockhardt's' CEO commented on their drug portfolio which contains the three drugs analysed by Livermore: 

 “*In 2019\-20 our sales were $440 m* \[USD440,000,000\] *\(Rs 3325 Crore\). It is a matter of great pride that we are now the only company in the world to hold QIDP \(Qualified infectious disease product\) status for six antibiotics, three of which target Gram Negative pathogens while the other three target Gram Positive difficult\-to\-treat ‘Superbugs’*” \( **5.3**\). 

 Global Phase 3 studies for WCK4282 and WCK6777 have been held back by the COVID pandemic but hope to be re\-established in 2021. WCK6777 has received the Qualified Infectious Disease Product \(‘QIDP’\) from the United States Food and Drug Administration indicating. The QIDP status provides fast track approval to drugs that are effective against a set of multi\-drug resistant pathogens, which have a high degree of unmet need in the treatment of infected patients. \( **5.3**\) The Chief Scientific Officer of Wockhardt \( **5.3**\) states that: 

 “*Livermore’s studies of one of these drugs WCK4282 reaffirmed the clinically interesting aspects of this antibiotic as a work horse antibiotic used against hard\-to\-treat Gram negative pathogens*” 

 He also describes the potential benefit of the third Wockhardt drug WCK5222 \(cefepime\-zidebactam\) \( **3.4**\) as “ *WC 5222 meets the urgent threat of Carbapenem\-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae and serious threats like multidrug\-resistant Acinetobacter and multidrug\-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is positioned as a novel MOA\-based, high\-efficacy destination therapy for XDR pathogens beyond the treatment scope of existing products in the US and Europe.   The investigational product is manufactured for Phase III trials at FDA\-approved contract manufacturing sites in Europe. An abridged Phase III global study protocol has been finalised in consultation with US FDA, European Medicine Agency \(EMA\) and Chinese regulator, National Medical Products Administration \(NMPA\)”* \( **5.3**\). 

 **Impact on Patient care: Saving lives of Patients with Hard\-to\-Treat Life Threatening Infections** 

 **Livermore’**s expertise in identifying and interpreting resistance mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria was invaluable in guiding treatment of specific patients, some with life\-threatening infections \( **3.1**\). During **Livermore’s** part\-time secondment to PHE \(1.5 days per week from 2011\-18\) he was frequently \(often on a weekly basis\) consulted by clinicians to use his expertise and knowledge to advise on unconventional regimens for infection caused by multidrug\-resistant pathogens, where standard treatment options had been exhausted. It sometimes included compassionate use of developmental agents prior to licensing. Three such examples \( **5.4a\-c**\), have been published as patient case notes where bespoke antibiotic drug regime led to successful patient outcomes. The Director for the Centre for Clinical Infections and Diagnostics Research, a consultant microbiologist at Guy’s & St Thomas’ Hospital states that “ *one such case study was a 78\-year\-old woman who was admitted to the intensive care unit at London Bridge Hospital with aortic valve endocarditis that was not controlled by all currently available antibiotics and therefore life\-saving surgery to replace the heart valve could not proceed. Blood cultures grew an extremely drug\-resistant \(XDR\) Pseudomonas aeruginosa due \[..\]that we rarely see in the UK. The patients was colonised with other resistance bacteria that complicated the situation \(Klebsiella pneumoniae with OXA\-48 carbapenemase and Acinetobacter baumannii with OXA\-23/OXA\-51 A\). Discussion led to a decision to make a successful, formal request for compassionate use of cefiderocol \(subsequently licensed under the trade name Fetroja\) after **David \[Livermore\]** had arranged urgent susceptibility testing of cefiderocol to confirm its activity against the isolate. Two days after starting cefiderocol treatment the septicaemia was stopped and aortic valve replacement could proceed with a successful outcome. It is highly likely that without this successful treatment plan this patient would not have survived. This was a particularly successful case which illustrates the path we have to follow, that **David \[Livermore\]** has helped with over the years at multiple stages*” \( **5.4a**\).

 **Livermore’s** research highlighted the scale, mechanism and global spread, of rapidly emerging multi\-drug resistant carbapenemase\-producing organisms \( **3.1**\). **Livermore’s** research expertise in this area and his secondment role with PHE informed 1\) the updated screening criteria for suspected cases of carbapenem resistant infections including travel from abroad including Indian subcontinent 2\) guidance on the therapies to be prescribed to treat carbapenem resistant infections, 3\) advice on monitoring infection trends in trusts and robust diagnostic plans using laboratory services. In 2013, **Livermore** was invited to join a British Working Group commissioned by PHE. This group outlined AMR concerns and developed a **toolkit** \(published 2014\) \( **5.5** designed to prevent and reduce the spread of carbapenemase\-producing Enterobacterales \(CPE\) infections in health and residential care settings. This was a key pathway to raising awareness of CPE infection and prevention methods in Trusts across England as evidenced by widespread uptake of the toolkit into local trust guidelines \( **5.5**\). The Director for the Centre for Clinical Infections and Diagnostics Research, a consultant microbiologist at Guy’s & St Thomas’ Hospital states “ *the toolkit they published in 2014 to reduce the spread of carbapenemase\-producing Enterobacteriaceae \[…\]is a landmark reference document on which the framework for infection control of CPEs is based at probably all NHS hospitals including our own”* \( **5.4**\). The toolkit advised front line staff about the 1\) early detection of these infections through early recognition of individuals who may be colonised 2\) improved laboratory screening methods for these infections 3\) prevention and control of infections through enhanced cleaning and decontamination protocols 4\) isolation procedures for patients with infections. It also provided a series of checklists for the Trust Boards, Executive and IP&C teams to ensure effective infection prevention practices are in place within Trusts and information sheets on CPE infections for patients and families. An accompanying letter to the toolkit from the Chief Executive of PHE sent to all Trusts in England stated that: “ *The toolkit is intended to provide a framework to support local risk assessment, providing the minimum interventions required to safeguard patient safety and prevent an escalation of the problem*” \( **5.5**\). 

 A 2019 PHE commissioned quantitative evaluation of the toolkit in all English trusts \( **5.8**\) showed; 

-  92% of Trusts, implemented or wrote new local prevention plans based on this toolkit; 

-  75% reported consistent compliance with screening and isolation of CPE risk patients outlined in the toolkit. 

 A qualitative evaluation was undertaken on the implementation of the toolkits in 2017 based on 44 interviews with staff from 12 Acute Trusts. This report includes a statement that one Trust used the toolkit *‘to inform and check their own CPE prevention, management and control plans in particular in the event of an outbrea*k’ \( **5.7** pg. 18\). In addition, the toolkit has been used as a catalyst for change and influenced individual trusts to change their funding priorities. 

 “*The CPE toolkit was seen as a credible source of information, which could help to secure management support for financial investments to address resource challenges such as a shortage of isolation facilities or funding for additional training’ \(* **5.7** pg 6\) Individual hospital trusts have also provided accounts of how they have implemented the toolkit. The Royal Wolverhampton Trust UK, reported to its Trustee’s that “ *So far there have been 12 patients identified as having CPE\-producing organisms in the New Cross Microbiology Laboratory \[..\] So far during 2014 there have been two incidents during which the toolkit has had to be actioned and these account for four of the twelve patients. Local application of the toolkit has been successful in these instances, and there is no evidence of widespread dissemination of these resistant organisms*’ \( **5.9**\). 

 In October 2020, this toolkit was updated and published as a new document ‘ *Framework of actions to contain carbapenemase\-producing Enterobacterales* that also draws on **Livermore’s** research \( **3.6**\) *.* This update was in response to the published evaluation reports \( **5.7, 5.8**\) and feedback from key stakeholders requesting one document in a simplified format that provides a framework of actions for all health and social care providers in acute and non\-acute settings. The objectives of the new framework are the same namely 1\) to provide a framework of actions and tools to support health and social care providers 2\) support development of local guidance and tools for the early detection of CPE with the aim of preventing transmission and containing their spread for the safety of patients and the wider population 3\) direct health and care professionals to the relevant guidelines for laboratory methods, including reporting of results to PHE. The original Acute trust toolkit for the early detection, management and control of carbapenemase\-producing Enterobacteriaceae has also been used to develop similar, specific toolkits for Scotland in 2017, Wales in 2018 and for non\-acute and community settings in England 2019 \( **5.6**\). Finally, in 2020 the Department of Health and Social Care changed its policy on notifiable diseases stating ‘ *Acquired carbapenemase\-producing Gram\-negative bacteria to the list of causative agents which, when identified in a human sample, **must be notified** by the operator of a diagnostic laboratory to Public Health England \(PHE\)’* \( **5.10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Meek’s research on sport and physical activity in prisons resulted in policy change and improvements for the 80,000 adults and children held in English and Welsh prisons. Her research led to a new cross\-government Sports Forum, an audit of every youth prison and the development of a physical activity strategy for women and girls in custody. Meek’s research facilitated sporting bodies to work in prisons and empowered prison staff to improve physical activity provision. She has given evidence to major government inquiries, prompted the UN resolution on the use of sport to reduce youth crime, and instigated transnational prison sport initiatives. The research has stimulated widespread coverage in national and sports media. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 With a prison population of 80,000, England and Wales have one of the highest rates of incarceration in Western Europe. However, over half of adults and over 70% of children released from prison will reoffend within a year and the total annual estimated economic and social cost of reoffending is GBP18,100,000,000. Working with people in prison and tackling reoffending is one of the biggest challenges our society faces. Professor Rosie Meek’s research demonstrates that sport and physical activity have a unique and important – yet often overlooked \- role to play in responding to this challenge. 

 Research led by Meek has explored the rehabilitative potential of sport and physical activity as a crime prevention technique, demonstrating that sport can offer an alternative means of excitement and risk\-taking to that gained through engaging in offending behaviour. It can provide access to pro\-social networks, positive role models, and offer the opportunity to gain new experiences and achievements. Sport and physical activity can be a positive, cost\-effective and healthy leisure activity representing an alternative to offending which not only has intrinsic value but also provides a relatively easy way to establish a more positive self\-identity and support desistance from crime \(R2, R6\). Meek’s research showed that women and girls in prison are significantly less likely to participate in sport and physical activity than their male counterparts, demonstrating a monthly average participation in physical activity of only 48% of women in prison, with some women’s prisons recording participation as low as 29% in a month \(R3, R4\). It also confirmed that despite an expectation that those held in custodial settings should have the opportunity to be physically active, most prison establishments fail to meet minimum standards in this domain and sedentary behaviour in prisons has consequently been identified as a high\-risk health behaviour \(R1, R3\). 

 Access to and uptake of physical activity and sports based interventions have been shown to improve health and wellbeing, support prisoners’ attitude change and the development of life skills and foster relationships that inspire and motivate adults and children, including those with complex offending histories and challenging and disruptive behaviour \(R5, R6\). 

 Since 2013, research into physical activity and prisoner behaviour has identified the following key findings: 

-  Health promotion and wellbeing of prisoners with a particular focus on the types of activity which have the greatest impact \(team\-based\) and in what capacity/context \(adopting a collaborative approach based on choice and diversity of offering\); 

-  The sport and fitness sector being a route into further education and employment for young people and adults in the Criminal Justice System \(for example as personal trainers, coaches and mentors\); 

-  The manner in which sport and physical activity can be used as a violence reduction strategy in prisons and a way of improving relationships between staff and prisoners and between different groups of prisoners. For example, Meek demonstrated an 83% reduction in incidents of violence among detainees at HMP High Down who took part in their community\-led table tennis programme; 

-  An increase in the number of transferable skills, including communication, goal setting, fostering enhanced interpersonal relationships, prosocial behaviour and the regulation of emotions; 

-  Changes in staffing structures, resource allocation and partnership arrangements between prisons, community groups and sporting bodies to bring about reforms and best support efforts to reduce reoffending. 

 Collectively, this work has led to the increased adoption of sports\-based interventions and evaluations in prison settings, enhanced prison staffing and targeted governance to support effective sport and physical activity in prisons. This includes better sports and Physical Education resources in prisons, a heightened awareness of the importance of access to physical activity in prisons, and a greater commitment to the development of prison\-community partnerships that draw on sports initiatives in efforts to reduce reoffending.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Drawing on her extensive academic research, Meek’s independent review ‘A Sporting Chance’ was undertaken on behalf of the Ministry of Justice in 2018, in order to improve sports and Physical Education \(PE\) provision in prisons, young offender institutions, secure training centres and secure children’s homes throughout England and Wales. Good practice examples were identified and the findings informed a dozen recommendations, 11 of which were accepted by government and have subsequently shaped national policy and practice \(E1\). The key areas of impact resulting from this body of work are as follows: 

 **Enhancing prison governance and staffing to support the effective use of sport and physical activity in prison.** 

 Meek’s research has directly influenced the work of the Ministry of Justice and HM Prison and Probation Service \(HMPPS\), and shaped daily practice in all 122 prisons across England and Wales. There is now a greater recognition and understanding of the role of sport by prison managers and staff, and the profile of sport and physical activity in prisons has been elevated across the prison staffing structure. Job descriptions for prison PE staff have been adapted to reflect Meek’s recommendation that staff engage more closely with community organisations in supporting prisoners to prepare for release. 

 Meek’s work is cited in two key HMPPS operational documents, the 2019 *Strategic Review of Physical Education in Prisons* and the 2018 *Model for Operational Delivery: Young Adults \(18\-25\).* Alongside leading the 2018 independent review on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, Meek’s research featured in the Digital, Culture, Media & Sport Committee inquiry, their 2019 report \(E1\), and in a further ten citations in Hansard parliamentary debates since December 2017 \(E1\). 

 \[text removed for publication\], at HMPPS confirmed in November 2020 that \[text removed for publication\]. Specifically, the resulting governance included a joint action plan between HMPPS and the Youth Custody Service, with the creation of local action plans to address the Review’s recommendations: \[text removed for publication\] \(E2\). In addition, the governance recommended the creation of the *Sports Forum*: a strategic, cross\-government approach, bringing together Sport England, the NHS, the Home Office and Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport: \[text removed for publication\] \(E2\). 

 **Improving outcomes for children and preventing youth crime** 

 Meek’s research has been instrumental in improving health and educational outcomes for the 650 children in custody in England and Wales, through improving access to and better integrating sport and physical activity in youth custody settings. Her 11 adopted research recommendations have been integrated into the way that the Youth Custody Service awards tenders for externally contracted work  Overseeing these reforms, Rob Lawman, Senior Policy Advisor in the Youth Justice Policy Team confirms: *“Rosie's piece of work raising the profile of this agenda of youth custody shouldn't be underestimated”* \(E3\). 

 This development has been driven by a commitment from prison leaders to adopt Meek’s recommendation that physical activity and sports\-based interventions are more effectively used to support the most vulnerable and excluded children in our youth justice system: \[text removed for publication\] \(E2\). On improving outcomes for children in prison, Novus, the educational provider for 570 children held in youth custody establishments within England, confirm that Meek’s research has led to the development of a new specialist post within the staffing team, who has full time responsibility for Sport and Enrichment Coordination \(E6\). 

 This work has also improved access to physical activity for young people at risk of engaging in crime. Meek was the sole academic representative to lobby for better access to sports facilities for socially excluded youth, which was subsequently incorporated into the Conservative manifesto for the 2019 General Election. Huw Edwards, CEO of UK Active testifies that: “ *Rosie’s influence on the framing and engagement of that agenda has been huge… Rosie’s influence on opening up schools and public facilities to lower\-income families and at\-risk young people has also led to practical interventions on the preventative side of criminal justice* \(E7\). Specifically focusing on improving access and outcomes for the BAME children who now represent more than half of all children in youth justice settings, Meek’s work has resulted in the funding and delivery of new initiatives that seek to tackle disproportionality in justice settings: 

 *“Recommendation 8 …led to our launching the £1.7m Levelling the Playing Field project in January 2020 alongside the Youth Justice Board”* \(E4\). 

 Meek’s research has also been instrumental in developing international use of sport for youth crime prevention. Her work with the UN Office for Drugs and Crime \(UNODC\) led to the 2019 adoption of General Assembly resolution 74/170 entitled “Integrating sport into youth crime prevention and criminal justice strategies”. The UNODC have confirmed that: \[text removed for publication\] \(E5\). 

 **Increasing physical activity and improving conditions for women and girls.** 

 Meek’s research highlighting the low rates of physical activity for women and girls and the gendered barriers to engaging in physical activity in prison has led to improved conditions for women and girls in England and Wales, including the construction of a dedicated strategy, the procurement of women’s PE clothing and targeted interventions and programmes: \[text removed for publication\] \(E2\). 

 Focusing specifically on the small number of girls in custody, Novus has provided a clear link between Meek’s research calling for a trauma\-informed approach to working with girls and engaging more effectively with this under\-served and vulnerable group: *“With boys making up the majority of learners at Rainsbrook \[Secure Training Centre\], girls had previously been left behind and put off sport for a variety of reasons. Now, we have sought the girls’ feedback about what they want and have initiated specific girls’ gym sessions, as well as dance and netball”* \(E6\). 

 **Establishing relationships between prisons and community groups.** 

 As well as facilitating prison staff to engage in more community partnership working, Meek has addressed the All Party Parliamentary Group for Sport and used her research findings to support a broad range of voluntary, community and sporting organisations \(including UK Coaching, England Boxing, Table Tennis England, parkrun, UK Active, the Change Foundation, and the Youth Sport Trust\) on the use of sport and physical education in prisons and in reducing crime. Her research findings have been instrumental in establishing relationships between prisons and external providers, leading to the delivery of new initiatives that support people in prison and after release from custody: “ *Rosie’s recommendations in this area have given us personally the opportunity to open up those conversations and we’ve found prison staff more receptive as a result”* \(E6\). Meek’s research has been instrumental in enabling sporting organisations and bodies to deliver programmes in Criminal Justice settings for the first time, as demonstrated by the CEO of UK Active, representing their 4,000 members: “ *We now have partnerships and projects in place, and many ongoing conversations taking place investigating those two key areas from Rosie’s Review that are relevant in our area \- raising physical activity levels and developing employment opportunities post\-release. That narrative wasn’t on the radar of my membership prior to our engagement with Rosie*” \(E7\). 

 In turn, her work has also led to prison education providers engaging directly with sporting bodies: *“We are now empowered to approach local organisations and national governing bodies as the examples cited in Rosie’s report provide all the evidence we need to prove the potential benefits of them getting involved… these fruitful partnerships are what will leave a massive ‘Rosie footprint’ all over the prison estate. It will be her legacy”* \(E6\). 

 In providing the theoretical framework and evidence base for organisations to deliver in criminal justice settings, the research has led to sustained impact in the sports for development sector. Brighton Table Tennis Club and Richmond RFU have enacted programmes using Meek’s research as a ‘way in’ to prison settings. The Head of Community Rugby at Richmond Rugby states *“... we thank Rosie for providing the evidence base which laid the platform for our holistic programme to flourish”* \(Head of Community Rugby, Richmond Rugby\) \(E10\). 

 As well as empowering organisations around the world to develop an evidence\-based approach to using sport as a crime reduction technique, Meek was also a key figure in the establishment of the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice, a charitable organisation with a global membership of over 400, *“It’s fair to say that the Sporting Chance Review has positively impacted on the work of all these members. It’s changing the game for sport in criminal justice in so many ways*” \(E4\). With further global reach, Meek’s work has been critical in the development of parkrun in custodial settings, an initiative promoting health and wellbeing, as confirmed by World Champion Triathlete Chrissie Wellington, Head of Health and Wellbeing at parkrun: “ *We drew heavily on her research to inform the development of this initiative, and its evaluation… To date, parkrun events have been set up on over 30 custodial sites in the UK, Ireland and Australia, with the demand for more to be activated. As of December 2019 \- two years on from the first ever prison parkrun at HMP Haverigg in Cumbria \- over 4,000 parkrunners had clocked up over 23,000 walks, jogs and runs within prison walls""* \(E8\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Substantial changes in global airspace management were necessary after the Eyjafjallajökull volcanic ash crisis of 2010. Research at the University of Bristol \(UoB\) has played a central role in these changes by: 

-  Enabling Rolls\-Royce to develop plane engines that can be safely flown through volcanic ash clouds 

-  Building new methods and tools to improve ash forecasting and monitoring, now used by Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres around the world 

-  Advising NATO on safe military operations, not only in ash clouds but also in other dusty environments, reducing risk to personnel 

-  Avoiding airport closure during volcanic eruptions by advising the Guatemalan Civil Aviation Directorate and Geological Survey 

 These impacts have resulted in socio\-economic benefits for the aviation industry, including minimising exposure to liabilities of over GBP2 billion, and safer flight for passengers and aviation personnel all over the world. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Volcanic eruptions can inject huge quantities of ash high into the atmosphere, where it presents significant risk to civil and military aircraft.  Mitigation strategies are costly, requiring cancelled flights, rerouting and more intense maintenance regimes.  Research across the School of Earth Sciences at UoB has made a significant contribution towards the global understanding of volcanic ash cloud composition, dynamics and hazard, particularly in the reduction of uncertainty in modelling and observation. 

###  Volcanic ash effects on aircraft engines 

 Work by the experimental petrology group, in conjunction with Rolls Royce, tested the behaviour of a range of volcanic materials with engine components at high temperatures. This research demonstrated that the nature of volcanic ash \(median grain size and composition\) strongly affects its transport and deposition and its deleterious effects, such as accretion, erosion and corrosion, on the engine \[ **3.1**\]. The results, using UoB’s experimental design, indicated that ash with lower silica content and finer ash particles are more likely to stick to engine parts.  Silicic ash, on the other hand, tends to form cindery deposits, which are more likely to self\-clean \[ **3.2**\]. At the request of Rolls\-Royce, UoB researchers performed experiments with desert dust, which is chemically similar to volcanic ash and can also cause problems with engine function and, thus, flight safety.  These experiments demonstrated that desert dust with lower quartz content can behave similarly to volcanic ash, and presents greater damage to engines than volcanic ash as it is usually present at lower altitudes. 

###  Volcanic ash modelling 

 Volcanic ash dispersion models are crucial in forecasting ash clouds for aviation hazard management. They are used by all nine Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres \(VAACs\) worldwide, who issue warnings to pilots. These models had typically ignored the relationship between the rise height of volcanic plumes and the rate that particles are injected into the atmosphere. UoB research showed that neglecting wind effects, as was operational practice, can lead to underestimates of the amount of ash released by as much as a factor of 100, as was the case at Eyjafjallajökull **\[3.3\]**. The UoB modelling group developed a free web tool, PlumeRise, which gives more accurate estimates of the amount of ash injected into the atmosphere during a volcanic eruption because, uniquely, it properly accounts for the effect of the atmospheric state and wind. This reduces the risk of underestimating the amount of ash released and the extent of airspace containing ash, which would otherwise compromise the management of airspace during volcanic crises. 

###  Characterisation of volcanic ash 

 The UoB group have made significant developments in methods for observing and characterising volcanic ash from satellites. As more satellite observations of an ash cloud become available, the observed location of the cloud at a particular time can be used to reinitiate the dispersion model in a process known as data insertion. This method was first applied by UoB academics, supported by researchers at the Met Office, to two recent eruptions which affected European airspace \(Eyjafjallajökull and Grímsvötn\). UoB demonstrated, for the first time, large reductions of up to 50% in the uncertainty of forecasts **\[3.4\]**. In addition, uncertainty in well\-established observational methods was delimited, improving confidence in satellite measurements **\[3.5\]**. Further improvements have been made by taking the shape of ash particles on the distance travelled into consideration. The traditional assumption that particles are spherical can lead to underestimation by up to 400km of the distance they will travel **\[3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The transport of ash by the wind can result in dispersion over vast areas at heights where aircraft fly. The ash poses a severe hazard to airframes and engines, requiring mitigating restrictions on flight operations.  A notable example affecting the UK was the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull \(Iceland\) which resulted in extended closure of airspace, the cancellation of more than 100,000 flights and an estimated economic loss across all sectors of USD5 billion.  The research conducted by UoB has led to safer air travel and demonstrable impacts which benefit the aerospace industry, airlines, airspace management and the military. These impacts continue to mitigate the level of disruption by ash in the UK airspace seen in 2010. 

### 1.  Ash\-tolerant engines for Rolls\-Royce 

 Triggered by the 2010 crisis, Rolls\-Royce approached the UoB researchers in 2011 and instigated a collaborative project \(running 2011\-2017\) aimed at minimising aviation disruption caused by volcanic clouds whist maintaining high safety requirements \[ **5.1**\]. In March 2017, Rolls\-Royce published a technical note \[ **5.1**\] which established, for the first time for any engine manufacturer, a dosage up to which their engines can tolerate ash and led to a 2018 UK Civil Aviation Authority Flight Safety Award. In developing this dosage, Rolls\-Royce relied on underpinning research carried out by UoB, drawing on the new understanding of how ash affects engines \[ **3.1**, **3.2**, noting publication of **3.1** was delayed at the funder’s request\] and observations and modelling of volcanic ash clouds \[ **3.3\-3.6**\]. The translation of this UoB research into practice represents a wholly new and very valuable approach that is “ *ultimately based around engine exposure dose rather than simply ash concentration.* \[This\] *will save the aviation industry, and the wider economy, multiple 10s of £millions annually*” through reduced disruption and better maintenance regimes \(Engine Environmental Protection, Rolls\-Royce\) \[ **5.1**\]. 

 Rolls\-Royce are the first engine manufacturer in the world to do this and, as a result, they are currently the only engine supplier certified to operate in volcanic ash. Rolls\-Royce lease their engines to airlines who can now operate in volcanic ash conditions. Rolls\-Royce’s engines are thus a more desirable option: “\[which\] *gives Rolls\-Royce a competitive advantage when selling aircraft engines to airlines that operate in regions prone to frequent volcanic eruptions, because no other engine manufacturer has the knowledge and capability to allow their customers to use the approach*” \(Engine Environmental Protection, Rolls\-Royce\) \[ **5.1**\]. Improvement in understanding of engine exposure and damage mechanisms enables clear boundaries to be defined in terms of responsibility for ash\-related damage, reducing Rolls\-Royce’s exposure to the costs of ownership. Rolls\-Royce estimate the cost of liabilities to be “ *over GBP 2billion*”, a cost which “ *the Bristol group’s knowledge is being used to help reduce*” \[ **5.1**\]. 

### 1.  Better ash forecasting with PlumeRise and robust ash characterisation 

 Dispersion forecasts for volcanic ash are reliant on inputs to characterise the eruption conditions and ash properties. The British Geological Survey state “ *The fundamental research on volcanic plume dynamics at the University of Bristol has contributed greatly to the international effort to   better understand and respond to volcanic ash emergencies”* \[ **5.3**\].  The London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre \(VAAC\) is responsible for managing airspace in N. Europe and the N. Atlantic. Underpinning research using the PlumeRise model \[ **3.6**\] resulted in their decision to invest in developing their own operational plume model. This model has increased the capability of the London VAAC to better initialise volcanic ash cloud dispersion models and uses non\-spherical particles and two new particle size distributions as a direct result of research carried out at UoB \[ **3.3**\]. This has enabled improved forecasting of the early stages of ash dispersion when there is incomplete knowledge of the ash particle size distribution \[ **5.2, 5.3**\]. 

 The PlumeRise model has an online interface which is available to users globally and, as of March 2020, 500 unique users have requested over 95,000 model runs. Users, who in total represent eight of the nine VAAC regions, include the London, Darwin and Buenos Aires VAACs and the Icelandic Met Office \[ **5.4**\]. The Darwin VAAC now runs a local version which it uses for monitoring Indonesian airspace, one of the world’s busiest for flights, combined with a high density of active, ash\-producing volcanoes and have stated “ *The PlumeRise model, web\-interface and under\-pinning research have contributed significantly to the work of VAAC Darwin and the Bureau of Meteorology, and therefore to the management of the ash hazard to aviation within our area of responsibility and more widely through our connections with the global VAAC network. The PlumeRise model supports our operational responsibilities, helping us to provide informative and science\-based advice to the aviation industry*‘’ \[ **5.4**\]. The model is used operationally many times each year, including for activity from Krakatau in Indonesia and Ulawun in Papua New Guinea in 2020. 

 The Icelandic Met Office have used PlumeRise in their eruption scenario planning exercises and incorporated it into their forecast and response system. During the Bardarbunga eruption in 2014\-2015 the model provided daily, high\-quality outputs that allowed for rapid assessment of the risks \[ **5.5**\]. The Icelandic Met Office describe PlumeRise as “ *an invaluable tool for assessing potential eruption scenarios and initializing ash dispersion models ….  At the time of the recent Holuhraun eruption \(2014\-15\), the PlumeRise model was the only accessible plume model that could run with the real atmosphere*” and further “ *These outputs were shared in the regular meetings between IMO and the Department for Civil Protection, and would have allowed for rapid assessment and dispersion model initiation had an explosive eruption occurred*” \[ **5.5**\]. Through formal communications between the Icelandic Met Office and the UK Met Office, these benefits were passed on to the London VAAC. PlumeRise training has been included in the annual International Training Schools on Convective and Volcanic Clouds Detection Monitoring and Modelling since 2015, reaching over 100 early career practitioner professionals from over 20 countries, as well as established research scientists. 

### 1.  Safer military operations for NATO 

 Watson, Phillips and Brooker of UoB were invited by NATO to co\-author a technical report, completed in 2018, for NATO and the UK Ministry of Defence that defines NATO’s position on safe military operations in hostile environments \(including desert dusts and sea salt, as well as volcanic ash\) \[ **5.6**\]. The UoB team led Chapter 3 of the report, which detailed the current state of the art in satellite remote sensing observations \(specifically uncertainties\), dispersion modelling and data assimilation, based upon previous research \[ **3.3\-3.6**\]. At \~400 pages and \~200,000 words the full report is available to over 2,000,000 NATO personnel as a guide for best practice. The report defines research and development priorities on safe operations in contaminated environments for the 28 countries within NATO. The UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory \(DSTL\) state “ *The University of Bristol were responsible for one of the key chapters of the AVT\-250 final report that set the context for the EP \[Environmental Particulate\] problem in aviation. This chapter included: a summary of EP characterisation methods, tools  and  equipment;  the  impact  of  meteorology  on  EP  endurance  and  its  dispersion; and guidance on the likelihood of encounter of EP at critical locations of interest to the NATO Nations when operating in other parts of the world and during different times of the year*” \[ **5.7**\]. 

 The former Chief Scientist of US Air Mobility Command, who led two research task group \(RTG\) efforts in which Watson played a pivotal role, states “ *The most significant impact has been the creation of a new research effort, with direct lineage to AVT\-RTG\-250, in The Technical Cooperation Program \(TTCP\) collaboration.  TTCP is a collaborative S&T forum among Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom.  A recent major program start is “Owning the Extreme Environment”, with the audacious goal of safe operations in conditions previously denied to or avoided by operators.  The \[NATO AVT\-\]250 study …helped focus and inform the TTCP.  I ... can attest that the structure and methodology Dr. Watson and his team originated to characterize, analyze, and forecast environmental threats will provide a foundation for our study*” \[ **5.8**\]. 

### 1.  Minimising airport closure in Guatemala during volcanic eruptions 

 UoB research is also informing national responses to volcanic eruptions, helping to minimise economic and societal disruption, continuing the work undertaken for the Icelandic ash crisis.   Guatemala has some of the world’s most persistently active explosive volcanoes, two of which lie within 40km of the main airport, La Aurora. The UoB researchers ran a workshop in 2017 to disseminate research on managing airspace in proximity to a volcanic ash source with the Guatemalan Civil Aviation Directorate, DGAC. At this workshop, training in the tools developed by UoB \[ **3.1\-3.6**\] was given to over 40 air traffic control staff. As a result, DGAC could ensure that La Aurora airport stayed open during the major eruption of Fuego in 2018, except for a period of about 24 hours on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> of June: “ *You* \[UoB\] *have run several workshops in the last five years, including with SENACYT \(the executive secretariat for STEM in Guatemala\), INSIVUMEH and DGAC \(the Guatemalan civil aviation authority\). They cite you as the key leader advising them in policy making around volcanic ash and aviation safety, and because of this INSIVUMEH were able to pass better information about the eruption to the DGAC more quickly during the eruption*” \[ **5.9**\] and “ *As a result, DGAC was able to manage the eruptions of February, June and November 2018 with greater certainty and that better understanding enabled us to keep the airport open when otherwise we might have closed it*” \[ **5.10**\]. As Guatemala’s only international airport, La Aurora airport is an absolutely vital transport hub serving the entire country and was a critical entry point for overseas aid after the disaster. 

### 1.  Queens Anniversary Prize 2015 

 Testament to the UoB research team’s achievements, they were awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize in 2015. The award recognised the “ *outstanding research into the risks posed by volcanoes to aviation, developing an innovative computer model for predicting ash plume movement and helping to make airspace safer for the public”*.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Maintaining cost\-effectiveness while reducing carbon emissions and increasing resource efficiency is one of the most pressing challenges facing businesses today. Research led by Dr Alok Choudhary resulted in the development of optimisation methods and SUSTAIN, a data\-driven sustainability toolkit for manufacturing and logistics operations, which have helped organisations from multiple sectors benchmark sustainability performance, cut emissions, optimise operations, and achieve financial benefits. Thanks to optimisation methods and SUSTAIN, six large companies in India and the UK have experienced annual cost savings of up to GBP750,000, lowered emissions by up to 24% and improved sustainability performance by up to 28%. Additionally, through research\-led fora, workshops and engagement with the Carbon Trust, hundreds of SMEs and other UK organisations have received tools to enhance their sustainability and competitiveness and reduce risk.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Businesses face mounting pressure from regulators, investors and consumers to address environmental and social issues such as climate change, carbon emissions, resource scarcity, forced labour and poor employment conditions. As a result, companies that do not integrate sustainability into their day\-to\-day operations increasingly risk serious financial and reputational consequences, as well as potentially failing in their duties to a wide variety of stakeholders. By developing and applying novel analytical methodologies for designing and managing sustainable supply chains, research at Loughborough has helped firms meet this challenge. 

 With around GBP660,000 in funding from sources including EPSRC, the Newton Fund, the European Union, and the British Council, Choudhary led or co\-led six projects between 2013 and 2020. Most involved collaboration with international academic partners, such as IIT \(India\), as well as various organisations, many of which are beneficiaries \(see section 4\). Focused on the manufacturing and logistics sectors, the research specifically addressed the evaluation and benchmarking of sustainability performance based on a rigorous set of key performance indicators \(KPIs\) **\[R4\]**; the identification of hotspots and the prioritisation of low\-cost interventions and best practices for operations improvement **\[R4, R5\]**; and the optimisation of logistics operations for cost\-effectiveness, reduced emissions, and resource efficiency **\[R2, R3\]**. 

  

 The research developed significant innovations for designing and managing supply chains by using mathematical models for optimisation and multi\-criteria decision\-making \(MCDM\). Such methodological advances are needed to utilise large\-scale, multi\-objective optimisation models while recognising real\-life constraints. 

 For example, the research developed a novel two\-stage methodology that combined MCDM and multi\-objective optimisation models for sustainable supply\-chain decision\-making **\[R1\]**. This allowed decision\-makers to assess the impacts of environmental, social and financial sustainability and to identify trade\-offs between them in selecting suppliers and designing efficient supply\-chain networks. 

 Similarly, by integrating financial and carbon\-emission objectives, the research developed and applied a novel optimisation methodology for tactical supply\-chain planning decisions **\[R2\]**. This provided important organisational and policy insights on the financial and emissions\-reduction impacts at a tactical planning level; the use of cost/emission trade\-off analysis for making informed decisions on investments; and the pricing of carbon for maximum environmental returns per dollar increase in supply\-chain cost. This research was further extended to logistics\-related operational decision\-making to optimise lead times, cost\-effectiveness, environmental impact and resource efficiency **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 Building on the projects mentioned above, Choudhary led the development of the SUSTAIN toolkit, a decision support system \(DSS\) underpinned by mathematical optimisation models **\[R1, R2\]**, machine learning algorithms **\[R3\]** and novel multi\-criteria decision\-making methods **\[R4, R5, R6\]** for the manufacturing, freight transportation and logistics sectors. The decision\-making frameworks were developed by using a rigorous mixed\-method approach for KPI identification, prioritisation, and industrial validation **\[R4, R5\]**. An intervention database was created by using qualitative and quantitative data collected through reports, policy documents, surveys, semi\-structured interviews, and active engagement of users via a series of industrial workshops in India and the UK. 

 SUSTAIN provides evidence\-based decision\-making to evaluate and benchmark sustainability performance in supply chains **\[R4\]**, freight transportation **\[R5\]** and managing risk **\[R6\]**. Its integrated frameworks **\[R4, R5\]** help companies to identify hotspots – that is, KPIs needing improvement – and prioritise low\-cost interventions and best practices for operations enhancement, using multi\-dimensional KPIs. SUSTAIN’s flexible and modular approach also allows decision\-makers to cut carbon emissions, increase cost\-effectiveness, improve health and safety, and even reduce traffic congestion and road accidents.

 Sundar Transport/JSA Logistics specialises in the Indian paper industry and has access to more than a thousand trucks. It implemented SUSTAIN as a part of the REINVEST EU\-India project \(2017\-2019\). In 2019 the Director of Sundar Transport credited SUSTAIN with giving the company “a structured approach and vast deal of knowledge and best practices for growth”, adding: “In the last two years, using a continuous improvement approach underpinned by the sustainability tool, we have transformed the way we manage our business sustainability goals... which has led to improving sustainability performance by 28%, environmental performance by 24% and increased retention of truck drivers by 20%. These figures are well above the Indian industry standard in this sector and of the size of the company – clearly a competitive differentiation for us, leading to new orders.” **\[S4\]**

 **• BT Plc and the telecoms industry supply chain** 

 The research team collaborated with BT Plc’s procurement group as a part of the UK\-India project \(2015\-2016\). With support from the team, the group developed an in\-house sustainability assessment tool for thousands of suppliers. In 2021 a senior executive of BT Plc stated: “Your sustainability research contribution to the development of BT’s Sustainability Assessor Tool \(SAT\) was very useful. It helped us to reach out to BT’s wider pool of suppliers. Our suppliers use \[SAT\] to set targets and start initiatives. Since 2017 the Telecoms Industry Association has adopted it as its tool for hundreds of member companies in the ICT sector, including AT&T, which has mandated its use amongst hundreds of direct suppliers.” **\[S6\]** 

 **• Capacity\-building for UK businesses** 

 To extend the reach of the research, impact has been delivered via knowledge\-sharing and training through industry practitioner fora and workshops **\[S7\]** under the banner of the UK Forum for Supply Chain Sustainability. Since 2016 Choudhary has co\-led the forum, which has benefited more than 200 practitioners across the UK. For example, in 2020 the Carbon Trust UK’s Head of Footprinting said: “This initiative provides supply\-chain professionals in the UK access to innovative insights, solutions and best practices to pursue initiatives and tackle sustainability challenges in the supply chain... \[and\] gain a competitive advantage.” **\[S7\]** In 2020 the Senior Manager – Risk, Policy and Governance at BT Group said: “The research\-led industry practitioners’ event at Loughborough helped us to expand our supplier base and promote sustainability in particular UK SMEs, learn from best practices and as a result reduce supplier risk.” **\[S8\]** 

 **• Regional businesses** 

 Engagement with regional businesses through umbrella organisations and policy influencers has also formed part of the strategy to extend the research’s impact. Since 2018 the team has collaborated with the East Midlands Chamber, which has more than 4,300 members, to deliver research\-led workshops and training events to hundreds of businesses **\[S9\]** and thereby contribute to regional strategies for two key growth sectors, low carbon and advanced logistics, which are worth a combined GBP8.1 billion GVA to the economy **\[S9\]**. In 2019 the East Midlands Chamber’s Director of Policy and External Affairs said: “These applied research\-based best practices have helped to enhance the performance, and sustainability of key manufacturing and logistics SMEs in the region... \[and\] very tangibly helped improve the competitiveness of SME businesses when looking to win business with companies such as Heathrow Airport, the Carbon Trust and BT.” **\[S9\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 For over a decade Whitworth’s research has been at the forefront of analysis of UK employment support policy. Whitworth’s research combines critical and comparative policy analysis with applied empirical analyses of the social and spatial impacts of policy interventions. Reaching beyond the academic community to affect real change in policy is a core component of his research practice. His work has directly influenced and led to significant impacts on priority health\-related employment support policies at national, regional, and local levels across the UK: 

-  Department for Work and Pensions \(DWP\) national employment support policy. 

-  World’s largest Individual Placement and Support \(IPS\) employment trial across the Sheffield City Region. 

-  New cross\-cutting governance mechanisms in the nine local authorities of the Sheffield City Region to deliver better integrated employment support.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Around 75% of unemployed benefit recipients in the UK have health\-related barriers to work and most wish to be in employment. However, this large group, despite being a policy priority, has for many decades suffered from markedly weaker outcomes and experiences within the UK’s employment support interventions. In response, Whitworth’s research activities have advanced understanding in: 

 Identification and payment\-by\-results redesign 

 DWP’s flagship £3 billion contracted\-out Work Programme promised to transform employment support experiences and outcomes. Serving 2 million unemployed participants across Great Britain between 2011\-19, Work Programme relied on an aggressive and differentiated outcome\-based payment model to seek to incentivise providers to support all service users effectively. In practice, Work Programme saw poor targeting, generic support, disappointing outcomes, and evidence of deliberate neglect \(‘parking’\) of more challenging unemployed participants \[R1\]. Parking refers to deliberately neglecting to give time, energy, or resources to unemployed claimants with more substantial barriers to work, given that such claimants are considered to be relatively unlikely to move into paid work and/or to require considerable, and usually expensive, employment support to make a move into paid work realistic \[R2\]. Whitworth’s innovative statistical analyses provided the first and most robust quantitative decimation of Work Programme’s flawed participant identification process and payment model design as well as alternative evidence\-based proposals for each \[R2\]. 

 Transforming work\-health support 

 Individual Placement and Support \(IPS\) is an internationally recognised employment support model for service users with severe mental health conditions. It involves IPS employment advisors working to an IPS fidelity scale co\-located into secondary mental health teams. IPS is well\-evidenced internationally to be effective but is niche in terms of its cohorts, settings, and participant volumes. As such there is enormous policy attention internationally in seeking to modify IPS models and successes to far larger and wider health cohorts across primary care and community settings. The key to success of modified IPS models is to amend the core IPS fidelity scale for these changed cohorts, settings and volumes whilst retaining IPS’s evidenced effectiveness. Whitworth’s research has led international scholarship, setting out an original analytical framework and critical guidance for the rigorous design of modified IPS models tailored to local contexts \[R3\] as well as then in their robust cost\-benefit analysis to inform policy decision\-making \[R4\]. 

 Devolution and integration 

 Local integration is key to delivering coordinated whole\-person support for unemployed individuals with health conditions and wider multiple needs, a key weakness and strategic priority in UK employment support. Whitworth’s research has advanced governance scholarship through his original distinction between its ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ forms and zooming in on positively networked accountability as the key but currently neglected route to effective policy integration \[R5, R6\]. 

 His policy engagement has transformed health\-related employment support in the UK in four key areas: design of payment\-by\-results models; identifying the right individuals for programme participation; transforming work\-health employment support interventions; and unpacking the potential of devolution for locally integrated interventions.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Whitworth’s research has transformed policy understanding, and the design and effectiveness of health\-related employment support policies in the UK at national and regional levels. 

 National policy impacts in the UK 

 Enhancing policymakers’ understandings of programme design 

 Since 2019 the £600 million voluntary Work and Health Programme \(WHP\) has replaced the Work Programme as Great Britain’s main contracted\-out national employment support programme. DWP’s key performance lever in WHP was a payment\-by\-results model through which to drive employment outcomes, taxpayer value\-for\-money and positive service user experiences. From 2015\-16, Whitworth was seconded to the DWP and embedded into DWP’s two key teams responsible: firstly, for the WHP participant identification and segmentation tool and, secondly, for WHP’s payment\-by\-results model. Whitworth guided the team through the key considerations, led team design workshops, and input to senior submissions. Whitworth’s impacts on WHP design were both general and specific. As the DWP Lead Analyst responsible for the WHP payment design summarised: *“Adam’s expertise in segmentation and payment\-by\-results across similar international contracted employment programmes provided an invaluable evidence base and guidance to our thinking”* \[S1\]. 

 Beyond guiding DWP’s overall understanding and thinking in these design teams, Whitworth’s impacts were central to shaping three specific elements of the WHP design: 

 1. Identifying the right unemployed individuals for the programme 

 The WHP is designed with a specific cohort in mind \- unemployed individuals with health conditions or disabilities and who have a reasonable prospect of moving into paid work with additional intensive support. Therefore, it is essential that the correct individuals are identified and referred to the programme. If they are not specific, key features of the WHP, including funding per participant, delivery model, support services, and outcome targets on providers cannot be realised. Whitworth’s research expertise in statistical profiling and segmentation \[R2\] was central to shaping WHP’s final design, including the development of WHP’s Identification Tool to select appropriate referrals from Jobcentre Plus into WHP. Whitworth provided expertise around profiling and segmentation and various profiling options. In addition, he recommended and advised on the incorporation of knockout questions to exclude referrals clearly outside of the target cohort as well as scoring questions to then prioritise the most appropriate referrals of those remaining. Both were incorporated into Identification Tool used by the DWP. As the Head of Health Provision, Change and Design at DWP summarises: “ *His recommendations around priorities and a proposed design approach for the Identification Tool to achieve them was influential in shaping our thinking and impacted directly on its final design and operation in Work and Health Programme”* \[S2\]. 

 2. Payment\-by\-results design: avoiding the previous pitfalls from differential pricing 

 Whitworth’s research \[R2\] identified that incorporating different payment groups and levels into the Work Programme created perverse incentives and ‘parking’ risks and, as a result, undercut DWP’s outcomes, user experiences, and value\-for\-money objectives. His findings were key to DWP’s decision not to attempt to incorporate these different payment groups and levels into WHP. Whitworth’s research \[R2\] was cited to this effect in DWP’s official impact evaluation of Work Programme \[S3\] and as the central piece of research evidence in the design team’s key recommendation to DWP’s Senior Programme Board to avoid payment groups and differential pricing in WHP \[S4\]. This recommendation was accepted and WHP therefore avoids problematic differentiated payment groups. As the DWP Lead Analyst summarises: *“Adam’s research into the weaknesses of the Work Programme payment model, and his knowledge of the limits of DWP’s administrative data for profiling, was key to our recommendation…and fed directly into shaping the eventual payment\-by\-results design”* \[S1\]. 

 3. Introduction of up\-front secure fees whilst maintaining outcomes incentives. 

 Finally, Whitworth’s research \[R1, R2, R5\] was key to persuading DWP that secure up\-front service fees of around £600 per customer needed to be included into WHP alongside its outcome\-payments, unlike the predecessor Work Programme. This is to both to mitigate ‘parking’ risks and to help smaller specialist third sector providers to be able to engage with the programme – key weaknesses of Work Programme. Whitworth’s contribution directly shaped the eventual payment\-by\-results design and the decision to use upfront payments \[S1\]. 

 **Regional policy impacts in the UK** 

 1. Evidence\-based design of the world’s largest IPS trial 

 From 2016\-2018 Whitworth led the design of Sheffield City Region’s \(SCR\) modified IPS health\-led employment trial \(HLET\) during his extended secondment to SCR \(£102,000 financed by SCR\). With the aim of transforming employment support for individuals with health conditions across the UK, the HLET is a randomised control trial and flagship national policy of the DWP\-DH joint Work and Health Unit \(WHU\). SCR contains around two million residents across nine local authorities spanning South Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire. 

 Individual Placement and Support \(IPS\) is a well\-evidenced employment support model for individuals with severe mental health conditions. The HLET is the world’s largest IPS trial \(£20m, 15,000 service users\) and innovatively modifies the traditional IPS model for new cohorts, settings, functions, and volumes. Specifically, unique IPS features designed into in SCR’s HLET by Whitworth are its expansion to a low to moderate mental health and/or physical health cohort, its expansion to an in\-work cohort at risk of sickness absence, and its co\-location with wider primary care teams \(e.g. GPs, physios, IAPT mental health teams\) and community services. 

 Whitworth led protocol development, design, costings, profiling, and evaluation strategy for the HLET. As the HLET Programme Lead at the national WHU describes, Whitworth’s research expertise provided *“considerable added value”* in a number of areas. This includes model design, costings, profiling, and local evaluation strategy, but particularly in the central IPS task of *“careful adaptation of the IPS fidelity scale to address the need of our trial cohorts, which differ from the \[IPS\] norm in terms of key patient characteristics, caseload sizes and delivery settings”* \[S5\]. As the Director of Public Health in Rotherham, writes: *“Adam’s knowledge of international employment schemes for people with health issues and of the IPS fidelity scale and evidence base, and how to flex it, has been essential to guide us through the project winning, design and launch so successfully”* \[S6\]. Dan Jarvis MP, Mayor of SCR, writes: *“Your excellent modelling and extensive knowledge of employment support programmes will transform the lives of those who are unemployed or in work and struggling within the City Region”* \[S7\]. 

 The HLET has successfully transformed experiences and outcomes for this key cohort. As of October 2020, the HLET had supported 3,010 service users in total: 1,800 unemployed individuals of whom 33% had successfully been supported into paid employment and 1,210 employed individuals at risk of sickness absence of whom 76% had successfully sustained their employment \[S8\]. HLET’s 33% success rate compares to a 10% ‘business\-as\-usual’ Jobcentre Plus counterfactual for the unemployed cohort where reliable benchmark data are known. For this HLET cohort alone this equates to an expected Treasury gain in reduced benefit spend and increased tax take of £6.3 million over 5 years. Although important, such financial calculations fail however to capture the HLET human impacts. One service user says of her success with the HLET: *“It’s a very lonely place when you are out of work. But now that I have a job my whole outlook has changed, and things are on the way up. I’m over the moon with my new role and it’s a real pleasure to come to work\!”* \[S8\]. 

 2. Building new regional governance to drive enhanced local integration. 

 Underpinned by Whitworth’s research into the potential for devolution to drive local integration \[R5, R6\], a second strand of regional impact relates to SCR’s development of innovative new cross\-cutting governance mechanisms – Local Integration Boards \(LIBs\). Each of the SCR’s nine local authorities use these new governance arrangements to enable effective whole\-person employment support. As the Director for Health Improvement in Sheffield, says: *“Adam has presented and shared some of his academic work on these ideas to those of us closely involved, and those concepts and thinking have shaped the development of the local system and policy landscape… As a result SCR and political leaders have signed up to building a set of new governance mechanisms called Local Integration Boards \(LIBs\) across the nine local authorities in SCR”* \[S9\]. Over 100,000 SCR residents are currently unemployed and with multiple support needs but failing to receive the coordinated whole\-person support that they require. LIBs represent a key strategic change locally in overcoming this current fragmentation of services. 

 Taken together, the changes to the employment support system, and how that benefits service user experiences and outcomes, are significant.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 For social workers, effective communication with children in challenging circumstances is key to gaining their trust. Sussex researchers’ child\-centric training workshops and digital learning resources have enhanced social work practice, enabling more meaningful conversations between social work professionals, children and caregivers. The project’s partnership with the British Association of Social Workers \(BASW\) and the International Futures Forum \(IFF\) has reached over 150 Children's Services Departments across England and led to social work organisations and practitioners adopting these methods, which supplement existing direct work practices with specialist adapted materials \(a ‘Kitbag’ that includes prompt cards and puppets\). The project has been developed into an Assessed and Supported Year in Employment \(ASYE\) academic module for newly qualified social workers, and also become a frequently\-used learning resource in a social work qualifying programme at the University of South Australia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since the 1970s, serious shortcomings in social workers’ communication skills with children have been a recurrent feature of reports published following the death or serious maltreatment of a child known to Children’s Services. Despite the chronic nature of this problem, research evidence about how social workers communicate with children in their everyday encounters remains scarce. 

 **The Talking and Listening to Children \(TLC\) Project \(2013\-15\)** 

 The TLC research is an ESRC\-funded four UK nations project which began in 2013 and was conducted by a team of academics from the Universities of Sussex, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Queens’, Belfast \( [http://www.talkingandlisteningtochildren.co.uk\)](http://www.talkingandlisteningtochildren.co.uk/). The research explored how social workers communicate with children in their everyday practice. Over a two\-year period ethnographic, interview and documentary data from diverse UK\-wide childcare social work settings were gathered and analysed. The scarcity of empirical research derived *directly* from ethnographic observation in this professional domain underlines the distinctive and extensive nature of the TLC dataset which comprises: \(i\) 82 observations of direct encounters between social workers and children/families; \(ii\) over 100 pre\- and post\-encounter interviews with social workers; \(iii\) extensive ethnographic observation conducted over 4\-5 months in eight diverse childcare social work teams \(two in each of the four UK nations\); \(iv\) 10 video\-stimulated recall recordings of social worker\-child interactions. The amalgamated UK\-wide findings underpin the research impact reported here. 

 **Key Research Findings** 

 Firstly, the research found that social workers’ communication with children is highly context specific, shaped by the individual *child*, their *case* \(i.e. their circumstances e.g. child in need, child at risk, looked after child\) and the wider organisational, societal and political *context*. It underlined that social workers need to treat each child as unique and recognise that children and young people have a range of understandings about and responses to social workers. Some, often taking the lead from a parent, experience their social worker negatively as a stranger, a threat, an intruder, ‘the enemy’. Others accept their social workers more positively as a visitor, a friend and/or a source of support \(R2, R3, R4\). This key finding has informed the creation of the TLC 3Cs – *child\-case\-context* – ecological model of communication, a conceptual framework to help social workers to respond to each child in their own right \(R1\). 

 Secondly, the research highlighted the efforts social workers make to engage positively with children and their parents, but how they often lack professional confidence and child\-centric resources to assist them in communicating with children. Indeed, the research revealed that less than 20% of the social workers who were observed used any type of resource to facilitate their communication with children \(R1, R5, R6\). This finding led to the discovery of a remarkable shortfall in the provision of resources by employers to facilitate social workers’ effective communication with children and young people. Very few local authorities have suitable child\-friendly meeting spaces and when social workers were observed to use play resources, they had, almost always, purchased them themselves \(R1, R5, R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Transforming social work practice through TLC practice development workshops, professional development digital resources and an ASYE module** 

 In 2017, the University of Sussex delivered TLC practice workshops to social workers in Brighton and Hove City Council \(BHCC\), and East Sussex County Council \(ESCC\). TLC colleagues in Scotland ran similar workshops for social workers in the City of Edinburgh and Fife County Council. Introducing practitioners to the TLC’s 3Cs model and the TLC website’s digital resources in these workshops supported the development of their conceptual understanding of, and practical skills in, communicating with children. Feedback included in the BHCC workshops evaluation report \(S1\) highlighted how the majority of the participants reported a marked improvement in their confidence in working with and listening to children. One practitioner’s description of the significant shift in her professional mindset towards a more child\-centred understanding of communication and engagement captured the workshops’ overarching impact on the participants: 

 “At the beginning when I was doing assessment, I was talking to the parents and whenever I met the children, I am interviewing them rather than doing stuff with them. Now I’ve realised that I can actually play or do things with the children and actually still get information out of them, and I end up asking my questions within whatever we are doing…. So yes over the last 6\-7 months there has been a noticeable change for me” \(BHCC Newly Qualified Social Worker\) \(S1\). 

 Around 50 social workers in total attended the workshops. On the \(modest\) calculation of each practitioner having, on average, 15 families in their caseload, often with two or three children per family, this suggests that the potential reach of these workshops’ impact encompasses over 1500 children. 

 The creation of the TLC open access website \( [http://www.talkingandlisteningtochildren.co.uk](http://www.talkingandlisteningtochildren.co.uk/)\), which includes online professional development resources that were co\-created with social workers, has proved to be of wide\-reaching and influential impact. Data analytics indicate that since the website’s inception in 2015, in a typical year the site receives over 3000 visits by 2400 unique users \(with the majority self\-identifying as social workers\) with approximately 1/5th returning twice more \(S2a\). Evidence of the TLC online reach includes adoption of the website’s professional development resources by the academic lead for the social work qualifying programme at the University of South Australia who introduced it to 150 4th year students: 

 “I introduced the Talking and Listening to Children You\-Tube videos to our website last year to guide students preparation and have found that the videos are a wonderful resource to help students understand the application of theory to practical aspects of social work with children. Students have a major assessment based on reflections on their role plays and I noted last year that they frequently drew on the Talking and Listening to children videos to inform their practice and reflections” \(S2b\). 

 The digital resources, comprising TLC findings, data and scenarios, have been a key influence on the curriculum design, content and delivery of the practice workshops \(above\) and the ASYE module \(see below\). A further tangible educational/professional development impact, arising directly from the TLC workshops, was the decision of the Principal Social Worker for Children and Families in BHCC to commission the University of Sussex to deliver a bespoke TLC research\-informed ASYE academic module for newly qualified social workers: 

 “The feedback was positive about the impact this \[the workshops\] had on their practice with children and young people and especially how it helped practitioners reflect on this. In response to this we are now working with the University of Sussex to include the project as part of the module for our newly qualified social workers as it is an important part of supporting new workers to demonstrate how we prioritise direct work with children and young people in our model of practice” \(S3a\). 

 In the academic year 2019\-20, twenty\-five newly qualified BHCC social workers were enrolled on the new ASYE module structured around the TLC research. All the participants were given their own Kitbag, a child\-centric resource designed to promote children’s emotional wellbeing. Kitbag has supported social workers in embedding the TLC research findings in their practice by: \(i\) promoting a child\-centred approach that understands each child and encounter as unique; \(ii\) equipping social workers with a bespoke resource to facilitate emotional wellbeing. Evidence from students \(e.g. S3b\) indicates that practitioners’ engagement with the TLC research findings via their practical take\-up of Kitbag has transformed their professional awareness and confidence and, more specifically, their child\-centred communication and engagement skills. The BHCC’s significant institutional investment represents a direct impact of the TLC research and demonstrates their ongoing commitment to embedding TLC research\-informed approaches in their wider, relationship\-based practice agenda. 

 In 2019 the TLC research findings were pivotal in the development of collaborative research impact partnerships with the British Association of Social Workers \(BASW\) and the International Futures Forum \(IFF\), a small Scottish charity that created Kitbag. The BASW 80\-20 relationship\-based practice campaign is committed to recalibrating the time social workers spend in direct contact with children and families \(currently only c.20% of their time\) and as part of this initiative BASW endorsed the TLC digital online resources and Kitbag as core components of their campaign. In April 2019, the University of Sussex co\-hosted with BASW a national 80\-20 campaign conference. Over ninety social work practitioners and managers attended the event, heard about the TLC research findings and were introduced to Kitbag. 

 Following the 2019 conference, groups of childcare social workers in eight English local authorities were provided with Kitbags. Beginning in June 2019, a programme of TLC practice workshops was established in each local authority with follow\-up workshops in 2020. More than 100 social workers, ranging from newly qualified to advanced practitioners, have taken part in the workshops. The workshop feedback concurred with that derived from the practice workshops and ASYE module \(above\) and provides similar compelling evidence of the beneficial impact on practice of the TLC findings/the 3Cs model/Kitbag combination. Social workers have reported how their mindset and approach to communication with children have been radically altered and their low professional confidence about direct work \(a concern identified by the TLC research\) has been significantly boosted: 

 “I feel that this session has changed my mindset in terms of direct work. It has shown me how to incorporate the Kitbag and other tools for direct work in my everyday work. It has made me feel less fearful as I feel clearer on how to make my visits more meaningful” \(S4\). 

 In December 2020 a follow\-up 80\-20 TLC Kitbag Practice Week \(held in lieu of a face\-to\-face conference owing to the Covid\-19 pandemic\) attracted 140 online participants to the keynote TLC Kitbag session. Overwhelmingly positive feedback from the event highlights the inspirational impact on practitioners of the TLC Kitbag message: 

 “Hope, the black bird.  Even the wounded bird still sings... there is always hope and it opens the conversation from despair and trouble to hope for change.  This is the nature of our work \- we are change makers\!” \(S5\). 

 Following the online BASW event and reflecting on the significance of the TLC research for local authority policy and practice, the BASW England National Director underlined the pivotal importance of resource\-based approaches and training, for practice: 

 “Its reach into local authorities across England is making a vital contribution to raising awareness amongst social work practitioners and managers of the crucial importance of more time being spent in direct contact with children and families and helping this be achieved in practice” \(S6\). 

 **Improving children’s and parents’ communication skills and interactions** 

 Since the TLC impact work began, feedback provided to social workers from children and families has underlined how awareness of the TLC research findings and access to Kitbag has enabled social workers to support children and parents to have challenging conversations *with and about* each other: 

 “This led the family to start to have a conversation with one another about their feelings and what they need from each other. The family found the session really helpful and T’s \(child’s name\) wish was for everyone to have a Kitbag\!” \(S7\). 

 Social workers have also reported how using Kitbag, in particular, has helped to open up meaningful conversations with children and parents living in challenging circumstances **:** 

 “We went through the cards and P said she wanted to pick some for her and then I could pick some. She knew what they all meant and was confident in picking some she could explain. After I had picked some she then asked to pick some for mum. Mum has been really ill from drinking, but things are getting better. P picked some which showed this, such as energy and courage, and then some such as trust and hope that helped her share that mum has had a slip up with drink again. I was then able to share this with mum in the Child in Need meeting which was really powerful to share the good things, and the ongoing worries and to help mum understand that P was sharing this rather than being directly asked about her drinking. P would like us to use this in the summer holidays at home with mum so that’s my next plan” \(S8a\). 

 In another instance a social worker described how the family “were inquisitive about the other parts of the Kitbag and asked if I could bring it again” \(S8a\). She went on to endorse how whilst working with the same family, Kitbag helped her to adopt a TLC\-informed focus by identifying one of the children’s individual needs, which, in turn, benefitted the child: 

 “It helped me a lot, as one of the children is very quiet and is currently going through an assessment for potentially having some additional needs, this really opened up the session and he appeared to feel at ease and really enjoyed the session” \(S8a\). 

 For one eight\-year\-old girl with emotional regulation difficulties, her social worker could see how by recognising her individual needs and selecting the elements of Kitbag’s specifically intended to address emotional regulation had a positive impact on her behaviour and their working relationship. Many children have requested that social workers bring the Kitbag with them on subsequent visits. Social workers have reported that parents have indicated their wish to purchase a Kitbag to help their family functioning. 

 **Improving and impacting on organisational culture and the policy agenda** 

 In February 2020, the University of Sussex successfully bid for Higher Education Innovation Fund monies and received £25K, which purchased 450 Kitbags for all the social workers and foster/family carers in two local authorities – BHCC and Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council \(RMBC\). TLC workshops for Designated Kitbag Leads, facilitated by the University of Sussex and IFF, are producing powerful repeated qualitative evidence of the very positive impact on individual practice and organisational culture of the TLC research findings and the adoption of Kitbag. The RMBC Principal Social Worker has reported how the TLC research findings and introduction of Kitbag are showing dividends in terms of a healthy organisation and a happy and invested workforce: 

 “Since beginning this work with you it is noticeable that the organisation's commitment to direct contact with children and families has increased and social workers are demonstrating creative and customised ways of introducing the Kitbag to children and parents. Social workers have told me how children really enjoy using it in their meetings and how the Kitbag opens up conversations that otherwise would be much more difficult to have. Our colleagues within Nurture Units in schools have found the resource invaluable in respect of mindfulness and calming techniques for those children who really struggle to talk. Teams are really valuing using this tangible tool which elicits curiosity when they talk to children, and so it's having a positive impact on workforce morale too” \(S8b\). 

 Another successful funding application to the What Works Centre for Children’s Social Care \(£107K, July 2020\), underscores the reach of the TLC research impact into the policy arena. The funding will support the expansion of the TLC Kitbag practice intervention, with approx. 800 social workers and foster/kinship carers in a further four local authorities being provided with TLC training and with a Kitbag. Reporting in 2022, this unparalleled practice intervention will be subject to an independent randomised trial evaluation. 

 As a direct result of the TLC research findings and its collaboration with BASW, the University of Sussex has significantly raised the IFF’s profile and brokered the introduction of Kitbag to a brand new market in England and Scotland. The distribution of mini Kitbags to 240 Children’s Services frontline managers in 90 English Children's Services Departments via the Department of Education funded Practice Supervisors’ Development Programme has elicited positive feedback, and in January 2021 the Principal Social Workers in all of the 151 Children's Services Departments in England will also receive a mini Kitbag. Total Kitbag sales attributable to the reach of the TLC project are currently in the region of 2000. \(S9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research in particle physics and cosmology at The University of Manchester \(UoM\) has had a global impact. Research in particle physics has been crucial in establishing the global media impact of Brian Cox, which has increased public awareness and understanding of science, and generated significant economic impact. UoM research has contributed to the scientific success of the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite project and to sharing that success with the general public. Brian Cox has engaged audiences of millions, especially through his world tour and popular book which feature and draw upon Planck data. This engagement has generated significant revenue in excess of \[text removed for publication\] and enabled people to understand, appreciate and enjoy science. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Brian Cox’s success as a research scientist underpins his media and public engagement success. His high academic standing makes him an authoritative voice and his specific expertise in particle physics regularly informs his media work. His success as a research scientist is evidenced by the following papers. 

 As part of the H1 collaboration, Cox led a novel measurement to probe the theory of strong interactions in the high\-energy \(diffractive\) scattering regime **\[1\]**. The simulation of collision events in this regime was the focus of **\[2\]** and in **\[3\]**, Cox and Forshaw identified a new technique for identifying boosted massive particles. This has since developed into a sub\-field of studying “boosted particles” through “jet substructure” and is being used to study the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. Largely as a result of this work, Cox became the leader of the “FP420” project to make the case for installing low\-angle proton detectors at CERN **\[4\]**. 

 Work published by Davis *et al*  **\[5\]** chronicles the design, construction and testing of the 30 and 44 GHz Front End Modules for the Low Frequency Instrument on the Planck satellite. This project, led by UoM, provided two of the satellite's nine frequency channels. The data collected from these modules was crucial for accurate foreground subtraction. In particular, the 30 GHz map was used as a tracer of galactic synchrotron emission in the cleaning of the large\-angle polarization data crucial in determining the optical depth to reionization. Accurate knowledge of this quantity is necessary in determining cosmological parameters such as the age of the Universe. Both the 30 and 44 GHz maps are used in the fits to the large\-angle temperature data. The cosmological analysis of the cleaned\-up data, first published in **\[6\]**, provided the most accurate prediction of the age and composition of the Universe. Data collected by the Planck satellite has led to a new era of high\-precision cosmology and allows scientists to study in detail the Universe shortly after the Big Bang and trace its evolution to the present time.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Context and pathway to impact** 

 UoM has a long history of research in particle physics, including notably the Higgs boson discovery **\[2, 3\].** Cox’s early public engagement work emerged in particle physics and cosmology, where astrophysics and particle physics meet. UoM research has led to Cox engaging the public in astronomy at Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, via programmes such as the BBC’s Stargazing Live. The Chair of the Royal Society Public Engagement Committee verifies that, “ *Brian Cox’s research, conducted at The University of Manchester, has been critical in establishing his position as one of the world’s leading science presenters. It was his BBC work on cosmology that really established him in the public consciousness. He set out to convey the excitement of particle\-physics research, through the broadcast media, contributing significantly to public interest in, and understanding of, the search for the Higgs boson, and has gone on to popularise many other areas of science*” **\[A\].** 

 Cox’s research, conducted at UoM **\[**e.g. **1\-4\]**, has been critical in establishing his position as one of the world’s leading science presenters. Through worldwide tours, popular science books, TV and radio work, Cox has engaged audiences in their millions. Cox has formed three registered companies \(BCLive LLP, BCLiveUK Ltd, Apollo’s Children Ltd\) to manage these media and public engagement activities. His public engagement and service to science is recognised by his OBE and Royal Society professorship \(see section 3\). 

 The Planck project, in which UoM research played a crucial role **\[5, 6\],** directly inspired Cox and Forshaw to write their popular science book “Universal: a journey through the cosmos” and Cox to design a tour with a heavy focus on cosmology. Cox and Forshaw wrote this book with the primary goal of enabling a lay reader to understand some of the details of the Planck measurements and their importance. Armed with the book, Cox designed a tour with explicit reference to the Planck data. The Universal book and tour would not have been possible, or would not have occurred in the same way, without the Planck data. 

 Links between UoM research and engagement activities that have led to impact are shown in the figure below. 



 **Economic impact of book sales and live tours** 

 ‘Universal: a journey through the cosmos’ was published via Penguin Books in 2016. The total consumer market sales for this book in the UK were 30,307 copies in hardback \(HB\) and 30,261 copies in paperback \(PB\) as of September 2020, at a combined value of \[text removed for publication\] **\[B\].** Other books authored or co\-authored by Cox and published since August 2013 are: 

-  The Planets \(2019\), \[text removed for publication\] 

-  Infinite Monkey Cage \(2017\), \[text removed for publication\] 

-  Forces of Nature \(2016\), \[text removed for publication\] 

-  Human Universe \(2014\), \[text removed for publication\] 

 As of September 2020, a total of 413,454 copies of these five books have been sold, generating \[text removed for publication\] **\[B\].** Note that several of these books have sold well in the USA and have been translated into >20 languages. Sales figures are for the UK only. 

 Within the REF impact period, Cox has delivered two tours: 

-  The Brian Cox Live tour, from 21/09/2016 \- 26/05/2017, involving 55 shows in the UK and Ireland \(debut, sell\-out tour\); 

-  Universal: Adventures in Space and Time, 7/02/2019 \- 16/10/2019, involving 68 shows in Europe, USA, Canada, Asia, New Zealand and Australia. 

 The Brian Cox Live tour sold 158,589 tickets and set the Guinness world record for “most tickets sold for a science tour” **\[C\]**. Brian Cox also holds the Guinness world record for “most tickets sold for a science show” with 11,433 people attending his Universal tour date at The Arena Birmingham, UK on 23/02/2019, beating his previous record of 8,787 in attendance at the Brian Cox Live performance from the SSE Arena, Wembley, UK on 26/05/2017 **\[C\]**.

 **Increased public understanding of cosmology through live tours** 

 Beyond economic impact, engagement with audiences via these tours has increased knowledge and changed attitudes around cosmology. 

 A critical review of the Universal Tour in the Guardian describes how it has changed attitudes, “ *by the time Cox concludes with “the planet is all we have, so let’s treasure it”, you’re left in awe of the rarity and preciousness of humanity, the skies, our Earth, and the magic all around us*” **\[Fi\]**. A review in the Liverpool Echo describes the audience learning concepts relating to Planck data, “ *Concepts such as the speed of light, black holes and the extraterrestrial seemed to be of particular interest to the audience in the Q&A, as we were taken to the edge of current understanding about the origin and evolution of our solar system and the universe*” **\[Fii\].** 

 A critical review of the earlier Brian Cox Live tour in the Yorkshire Evening Post shows audience enjoyment and learning, “ *my jaw dropped and I sat hypnotised for the next two* *and a half hours but completely immersed with the knowledge that was pouring out of the professor’s \[Cox’s\] mouth”* **\[Fiii\].** 

 **Reach of TV appearances** 

 Cox has hosted eight TV series for the BBC and ABC since 2014: Human Universe, Space, Time & Videotape, Forces of Nature, The Entire Universe, Life of a Universe, The 21st Century Race for Space, The Planets and Stargazing Live. 

 The Planets was a five episode series which ran from 28/05/2019 \- 25/06/2019 *,* recording an average of 2,500,000 viewers each night. It was the top science series of 2019 for BBC2 in terms of viewing figures and outperformed the channel average for the 9pm Tuesday slot by \[text removed for publication\]. Notably, The Planets series had in excess of \[text removed for publication\] views in China. 

 **Economic impact of media companies** 

 Cox is Director of three companies which manage his public engagement activities **\[G\]:** 

-  BCLive LLP – \[text removed for publication\] 

-  BCLiveUK Ltd – \[text removed for publication\] 

-  Apollo’s Children Ltd – \[text removed for publication\] 

 **Reach and impact on teaching physics to UK secondary school children** 

 BBC Head of Science states, “ *Research conducted at the University of Manchester, through the engagement activity of Professor Brian Cox, has had a significant impact on teaching physics and astronomy to UK school children through BBC TV programmes and BBC educational videos.* 

 *Professor Brian Cox has co\-developed and presented educational resources for primary and secondary school students. Partly based on his research at the University Of Manchester, Professor Brain Cox has developed and presented 11 educational videos for physics key stage /GCSE and National 4, covering Wonders of the Universe. These educational videos have been viewed* \[text removed for publication\] *times since the start of the financial year 20/21. Content is also available via BBC Bitesize for GCSE Physics \(Single Science\) including Professor Brian Cox explaining how we can analyse starlight using spectroscopy, which relates to UoM cosmology research. These videos have inspired a generation to learn about the universe and have been well received by teachers and students.* 

 *During the Covid\-19 pandemic, Professor Brian Cox delivered science lessons to 11\-12 year old secondary school children while schools were closed, as part of the BBC’s biggest online educational push in its history. ‘Science with Prof Brian Cox’ aired on 1<sup>st</sup> May 2020 and was requested* \[text removed for publication\] *times since it was launched”* **\[H\].** 

 **Impact on science policy and government investment in science** 

 In direct response to the challenges Brian Cox posed at the Royal Society Faraday Lecture titled ‘Making Britain the best place in the world to do science’, David Willetts \(Minister of State for Universities and Science, 2010\-2014\) stated at the Conservative Party Conference in September 2013 that, “ *Our aim is for Britain to be the best place in the world to do science. That is the challenge Brian Cox has set and, Brian, we are up for that. But to achieve that we must invest long term and get the next generation doing science and engineering. That means girls as well as boys""* **\[I\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In an effort to address the social marginalization of an ageing population, this research conducted in Italy has enabled older people’s participation in the creation of cultural heritage, while enhancing their wellbeing through reminiscence activities. The project has captured memories of Italian cinema audience members \(who in 2013 were over 65 of age\), thus rescuing and preserving intangible cultural heritage for future generations. By co\-creating a digital archive, the project has ensured the sustainability of this legacy while enabling older people’s digital inclusion beyond the project’s lifetime. Moreover, the research has fostered intergenerational collaborations between older and younger audiences, furthered younger generations’ involvement in a community forged through cinema\-going and enhanced public understanding of Italian cultural heritage.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Funded by a substantial Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) award, *Italian Cinema Audiences* **\(R1a\)** was a collaborative research project involving Oxford Brookes University \(as Principal Investigator\), the University of Bristol and the University of Exeter. It explored for the first time cinema audiences in Italy in the 1950s. Using oral history methodologies the project gathered cinema\-going memories from over 1,200 participants across eight Italian regions. With the assistance of our project partners UNITRE \(University of the Third Age in Italy\) and Memoro \(Memory Bank, an international non\-profit organisation dedicated to the collection of memories and life stories of people born before 1950\), these memories were captured using a combination of questionnaires and individual video\-interviews. These personal accounts have been contextualised with a variety of archival sources \(press reviews, box\-office figures, and film industry data\), allowing us to uncover the hidden side of Italian film history: its spectators **\(R2a\)**. 

 In February 2017, *Italian Cinema Audiences* launched the next phase of its research: the development of CINERICORDI \(based at Oxford Brookes University and funded by the AHRC Follow\-on Funding, specifically aimed at research dissemination and impact\) **\(R1b\)**. CINERICORDI **\(R2b\)** is an online interactive archive where the general public can explore the history of Italian cinema\-going through the memories of its audiences. The digital archive integrated our collected data \(questionnaires, video\-interviews, and cartographical data on 1950s cinemas\) with new and unexplored archival resources, including digitised artefacts related to cinema\-going, as well as crowd\-sourced collections from older cinema\-goers’ private archives \(comprising of photos, programmes, leaflets, private letters, signed posters, etc.\) **\(R3\)**. 

 Led by Daniela Treveri Gennari as Principal Investigator, with an interdisciplinary team of international experts on Italian cinema and culture, this research has provided the first nationwide study of cinema audiences in post\-war Italy. It was an innovative collaboration between universities, public and private archives, members of the general public and cultural organizations. The research has pioneered a process of rewriting history from “below”. By offering insight into audiences’ experiences, the project has empowered these protagonists and challenged the traditional top\-down understanding of Italian film culture, going beyond canonical histories of Italian cinema dominated by great auteurs and renowned movements such as Neorealism **\(R4\)**. 

 The international significance of this research has resulted in the adoption of the *Italian Cinema Audiences* model for further studies. These include the British Academy/Leverhulme\-funded *Mapping European cinema: a comparative project on cinema\-going experiences in the 1950s* \(2016–2017\) **\(R1c\)** and the AHRC\-funded *European Cinema Audiences* project \(2018–2021\), both led by Treveri Gennari **\(R1d\)**. The latter is the first large scale qualitative comparative study of cinema audiences in post\-war Europe. As with the *Italian Cinema Audiences* project, the memories of the cohort were used to investigate the personal, cultural and social significance of cinema\-going for European audiences. These memories enhance Europe’s multi\-vocal cultural heritage as a shared common history, curating it for future generations. 

 The innovative contribution to scholarship has been recognised by the international academic community \(the model has been adapted by other academics, for example, Dr Asa Jernudd’s *Swedish Cinema and Everyday Life: A study of cinema\-going in its peak and decline* project funded by the Swedish Research Council\). It has also raised awareness and understanding of the importance of autobiographical memories for the elderly **\(R5\)**. Moreover, the project has identified how the older generation can bridge the digital divide, becoming the curators of an online archive of the cinema\-going experience **\(R6\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The cinema audience research has had an impact in two main areas: ‘creativity, culture and society’ and ‘understanding, learning and participation’. Moreover, it has impacted positively on the social welfare and wellbeing of older people. 

 CINERICORDI has developed an accessible digital archive \(with 6,900 page views since April 2018\) that allows the general public to explore and contribute to a new history of Italian cinema\-going through the sharing of personal memories. It gathers data collected in *Italian Cinema Audiences* with further crowd\-sourced visual material \(over 1,200 items\) donated by cinema\-goers in Italy. Enabling older people’s participation in cultural heritage creation and preservation has been demonstrated to enhance their wellbeing, confirming the utility and success of the co\-creation practice, as highlighted in a report by Age UK ‘Creative and Cultural Activities and Wellbeing in Later Life’ \(2018: 3\). In fact, the main beneficiaries of this research\-led engagement were older people, who have been largely ignored in the creation of culture, especially in digital and online contexts. Through CINERICORDI they have become part of a community forged through cinema\-going: this has enabled them to be at the forefront of reconstructing the history of post\-war Italian film culture, traditionally only written by film scholars. 

 Ten public engagement events were held across Italy and three in the UK \(with over 1,000 participants between the two countries\) **\(S1\)**. Through collaborating with UNITRE \(which shared access to their national network of over 80,000 members\), 200 older participants have shared their positive feedback on these events and highlighted the benefit generated by the project’s activities both in terms of their sense of inclusion and valorization of their cinema memories: *“People my age feel the need to tell about themselves to realise that they exist”; “The recovery of memories feeds self\-esteem\!\!\!”; “It helps us remember and stimulates our relationship with others”.* Many have also highlighted the pleasure they feel in the process of remembering: *“They make me relive the good times”; “\[the project\] is helpful in remembering pleasant things”; “memories hidden and forgotten in a drawer, dug out with your help”.* **\(S2**\) Furthermore, CINERICORDI has inspired the creation of new knowledge and cultural expression amongst its participants. This includes: a book on cinemas in Amelia \(Italy\) written by one of the participants and presented at the Turin International Book Fair \(one of the largest book fairs in Europe\) **\(S3\)**; an exhibition on film culture in Manduria \(Italy\), which attracted around 1,500 visitors in one week **\(S4\)**; and research on local cinemas in Messina \(Italy\) **\(S5\)**. 

 Importantly, the project has rescued and preserved intangible cultural heritage for future generations. It has captured memories of Italian culture and created an accessible digital archive to ensure the sustainability of this legacy. A training programme delivered to the UNITRE members, both online and face\-to\-face across the country during the public engagement events, has extended the geographical scope of the project and enriched its crowdsourced collection **\(S6\)**. In fact, it was through the training programme that further crowdsourced data was added to the digital archive **\(S5\)** and new courses on the history of Italian cinema were developed for the members of UNITRE, using CINERICORDI as learning material **\(S6\)**. 

 The project has also fostered an intergenerational collaboration through online learning and research. Through CINERICORDI, two generations of cinema\-goers have taken control of their shared cultural heritage. This collaboration has tackled the problem of digital exclusion of older people through the development of a digital platform in which they are both curators and users. In addition, the project has enabled interaction with younger people, who helped the older users to navigate digital contexts in two events organised by the team in Rome. These interactions have benefitted the participating students through key activities and events. For example, in collaboration with the Italian Ministry for Education and the Society for Italian Studies in the UK, CINERICORDI organised a national competition ‘ *Come Andavamo al Cinema*’ for high school students **\(R2b, ‘Competition’\)**. By encouraging students to engage with the content of the archive in creative ways, the aim of this competition was to promote inter\-generational collaboration and greater awareness of the history of cinema\-going. The winners of the first edition of the competition were the students of class III K, ISIS Alfonso Casanova from Naples. The students, together with their teacher Prof Luigi Barletta, presented the winning film at the award ceremony at the Experimental Center of Cinematography in Rome on April 27, 2017. 

 This competition allowed students to engage with the digital archive and use it to learn about a significant aspect of the history of Italian culture: cinema and its audiences. The tools developed in the project have also enabled students to use CINERICORDI as an educational resource, both in Italy and abroad. The educational impact has enhanced student’s understanding of post\-war Italian culture as well as demonstrably improving academic attainment through face\-to\-face and online intergenerational engagement. It has also provided new materials for use by teachers, as part of their syllabi. In an evaluation of the project, a teacher described the students’ enthusiasm: *“they guided their grandparents in the use of the digital archive”* and *“developed a sense of self\-esteem which helped reduce the gap in academic attainment”* **\(S7\)**. 

 The new knowledge generated by this research has contributed to a wider discussion over Italian film culture. Public engagement has occurred at national and international level, with events and across radio, TV, press and social media platforms, as well as our website \(both in English and in Italian\), which has attracted an international audience \(over 52,000 page views since January 2015\) **\(S10, see also S1, S8, S9\)**. This has enhanced public understanding of the historical culture of movie\-going in postwar Italy. 

 The project also had a variety of positive impacts on our partner, Memoro **\(S11\)**. Participating in the *Italian Cinema Audiences* project has enabled them to develop their international reach, leading them to develop collaborations with other international projects \(ECA and We HOPE with Lincoln University\). It also helped them to define the new technical standard for all their future video projects and create an app connecting Nvivo metadata \(research outputs\) to the videos. These will have long term benefits for the organisation. 

 In summary, the *Italian Cinema Audiences* project has: enabled older people’s participation in the creation of cultural heritage, while enhancing their wellbeing through reminiscence activities; rescued and preserved intangible cultural heritage for future generations; fostered intergenerational collaborations that have furthered younger people’s skills and understanding; and been pivotal for our project partner’s future development.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Cambridge researchers developed the first automated network of ultra\-violet sensors to monitor volcanic gases at active volcanoes. Since the initial work on prototype instrumentation in 2002, the design has been implemented on 42 volcanoes across 18 countries and five continents. Sensors have been developed to be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles, which allows monitoring of highly active and difficult\-to\-access volcanoes. Worldwide, 500 million people live in areas at risk from volcanic eruptions. The impact of this research has been to: 

-  Protect life, property and livelihoods through: 

  -  enhancing the capability of volcano observatories worldwide to forecast eruptive activity in order to provide warning of imminent eruptions 

  -  providing critical input into government decisions leading to a\) evacuations and b\) mandatory exclusion zones 

-  Allow safe industrial re\-development \(e.g. geothermal on Montserrat\) 

-  Allow the people of Manam to stay on their own land, rather than being permanently displaced, through developing the ABOVE project community\-led resilience programme

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Up to the mid\-2000s, volcanoes were monitored largely using the occurrence of earthquakes and displacements of the ground surface, because these data were available at a high temporal resolution \(several measurements every second\) and were a reliable indicator of magma movement. Geochemical monitoring, which yields the only direct indication of magma close to the surface, was in its infancy, yet increases in gas fluxes from volcanoes often preceded eruptions and so provided a tantalising yet untapped source of information about eruptive activity. Gas flux data were available so infrequently \(once per day or per week, using cumbersome instrumentation\) that their utility was severely limited, despite their potential to track magma ascent and forecast eruption style. 

 Sulfur dioxide \(SO<sub>2</sub>\) fluxes are a critical part of volcano monitoring. When magma ascends towards the surface and decompresses, sulphur exsolves from silicate melt and enters the gas phase. This process is analogous to removing the cork from champagne, which results in CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles forming. The gas phase may migrate to the surface ahead of the magma, through permeable bubble networks. Increases in gas flux \(SO<sub>2</sub> is one of the primary gas species, the others are H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>\) therefore indicate the impending arrival of magma to the surface, i.e. they can be used, in tandem with seismicity and ground displacements, to forecast eruptions \[R1\]. 

 The impact described in this case was underpinned by research that took place within the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge between 2002\-2019, during which time a miniaturised UV spectrometer was developed for measurement of volcanic sulphur dioxide \[R2\] and the first network of scanning UV spectrometers was installed at volcanoes by **Edmonds, Oppenheimer** and co\-workers \[R3, 4\]. A network of three UV spectrometers was developed and installed in Montserrat during the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano in 2002 \[R2, 3\], whereby the spectrometers were connected to a scanning optical assembly and fibre optic cable, with power and telemetry, and code – which was made widely available \- was written to both acquire spectra and to retrieve SO<sub>2</sub> column amounts. SO<sub>2</sub> column amounts were combined with meteorological data to derive SO<sub>2</sub> fluxes every few minutes through the day, allowing the geochemical and geophysical data to be compared and interpreted on similar timescales, revolutionising the integrated monitoring of volcanoes \[R1, R5\]. 

 This development provided the model and basis for UV spectrometer networks elsewhere \[e.g. R3\]. In 2006, a modification of the instrument was awarded a US patent \(number 7,148,488: ""Apparatus for measuring radiation and method of use""\); **Oppenheimer** is a co\-holder of the patent and the instrument described has been distributed under the name of ‘FLYSPEC’. Scanning spectrometer networks were installed on 42 volcanoes \(for context, around 50\-60 volcanoes erupt every year\) across five continents between 2002 and 2020 \( **27 since 2013**, the period covered by this impact case\) by a number of research groups \(e.g. EU\-funded NOVAC, led by PI B. Galle, Chalmers University, co\-I **Oppenheimer**\) and volcano observatories *,* based on the design of the first installation in Montserrat, West Indies in 2002. 

 The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle \(UAV\) technology provided the opportunity for the ABOVE project, led by University of Cambridge researchers **Liu** and **Edmonds**, funded by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation, and including collaborators from the University of Bristol, USA, New Zealand, Germany, Sweden, Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica. The project developed cheap and portable sensors that could be mounted on UAVs to be flown into dangerous, highly active and difficult\-to\-access volcanoes \[R6\]. The data from these sensors showed previously unrecognised patterns in gas emissions related to bubble bursting, puffing and conduit dynamics \[R6\]. Subsequently, field campaigns to Guatemala, Montserrat and Papua New Guinea \(places with active volcanoes and particularly vulnerable populations\) in 2017\-2019 have established these UAV\-based methods, through training and sharing knowledge, as part of the regular toolkit of local volcano observatories for monitoring and hazard assessment. 

 Following the eruption of the White Island volcano in New Zealand in December 2019, and the tragic loss of life that followed, Edmonds was asked in August 2020 to provide consultant expert advice on gas monitoring data to the New Zealand Health and Safety Executive \(Worksafe\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Worldwide, 500 million people live in areas at risk from volcanic eruptions \[E1\]. The spectrometer networks first developed by Edmonds and colleagues at the University of Cambridge have been adopted by volcanological observatories on 42 volcanoes \(27 since 2013\) across 18 countries and five continents \[E2, E3\]. They are used to protect life, property and livelihoods through forecasting eruptive activity and informing critical decisions on evacuations and exclusion zones; to allow safe industrial re\-development; and – through the ABOVE project resilience programme \(Aerial\-Based Observations of Volcanic Emissions\) \- to allow the Manam islanders to remain on their island. 

 **Forecasting Eruptive Activity and providing warning of imminent eruptions** 

 The Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences \(GNS\), New Zealand, were among the first government bodies to develop a spectrometer system based on the design Edmonds and colleagues pioneered. Senior Scientist at GNS, Dr Craig Miller, states \[E4\]: 

 ‘*the UV scanning spectrometer network installed by Edmonds, Oppenheimer and colleagues in Montserrat provided the template for GNS volcanologists to develop a similar system at White Island, New Zealand. It is used for monitoring volcanic activity at this hazardous and unpredictable volcano. An increase in gas flux, along with increased levels of seismicity and ground deformation, would significantly increase the probability of eruption and consequently the alert level at the volcano, which is used for decision\-making surrounding issues such as restricting access and warnings to the public*’. 

 In October 2019, SO<sub>2</sub> fluxes measured by the scanning spectrometers \(and accompanying tremor\) at White Island increased to the highest levels since 2016, suggesting an eruption was imminent over the coming weeks and months \[E5, 6\]. On 18 November 2019, the alert level was raised to ‘2’ \(the highest before eruption\) signalling ‘heightened volcanic unrest’ and ‘potential for eruption hazards’ \[E7\]. 

 Tragically, an eruption on 9 December 2019 killed 19 people. In this case, clear warnings were not heeded, and preventative action which could have saved lives was not taken. 

 At Volcán Tungurahua \(Ecuador\), 30,000 people live in areas at risk from pyroclastic flows and lahars. A spectrometer system based on the Cambridge design was installed in 2004. Eruptions in 2013, 2014 and 2016 have had considerable impacts on livelihoods, particularly agricultural activities \(with crops damaged and land made unusable due to the deposition of volcanic ash\). The scanning spectrometer stations provide SO<sub>2</sub> flux data for the assessment of risk and early warning of eruptions. In February 2014 >600 people were evacuated after alert levels were raised in response to increasing SO<sub>2</sub> flux \(to over 2000 tonnes per day\), as well as increased rates of earthquakes and ash venting at the summit: 

 ‘*The automatic scanning DOAS stations as first developed at Soufriere Hills* 

 *Volcano, and which nice results have been shown by Edmonds and colleagues in 2003,* 

 *have been widely adopted by volcanological observatories over the past 15 years*… *At Tungurahua, we installed 2 DOAS systems directly based on the Montserrat UV* 

 *spectrometer system, the UV scanning spectrometer network yielded important data which,* 

 *when used in combination with other monitored parameters as seismic activity, allowed us* 

 *to assess hazard levels and advise local authorities on the general level of volcanic* 

 *activity’* \[E3, Instituto Geofisico, Ecuador\] *.* 

 **Providing critical input into mandatory exclusion zones** 

 In Montserrat, the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano ceased in 2011, yet it remains restless. One key characteristic is continued high flux of SO<sub>2</sub>, as measured by the spectrometer network, leading the government to retain an exclusion zone around the volcano. The Montserrat Volcano Observatory \(MVO\) and Scientific Advisory Committee \(British Foreign Office\) continue to rely on the SO<sub>2</sub> flux data to assess whether the eruption is over or has merely paused. The March 2019 MVO Scientific Report \[E8\] states: 

 ‘*the potential for continuing activity has been considered against the following three criteria:* 

1.  *Seismicity* 

1.  *Gas – daily SO<sub>2</sub> emission rates above 50 tonnes per day* 

1.  *Ground deformation* 

 *Criteria 2 and 3 are currently being met*.’ 

 Consequently, the volcano remains in an elevated state of unrest, with an exclusion zone including over half the island. 

 **Allowing safe industrial re\-development** 

 However, on Montserrat, the monitoring networks are now making economic recovery possible. The Government has permitted a geothermal plant to be established in the exclusion zone, a decision informed by advice from the MVO, based partly on gas flux information. The Director of the MVO \[E9\] states: 

 *‘In 2014 the Government of Montserrat gave permission for a geothermal company, the* Iceland Drilling Company *, to begin operations generating two boreholes from which it was projected that much of the island’s energy needs would be provided. A third well is planned for 2020. This permission was based on advice from the Montserrat Volcano Observatory on volcanic risk; gas fluxes were one part of the critical evidence upon which the low risk level for that particular area was assigned.’* 

 Test results indicate that geothermal power could generate more electricity than is needed by the island, freeing it from reliance on diesel\-powered generators – among the most expensive electricity in the world – and reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by replacing fossil fuel generated electricity \[E10\]. 

 **Allowing islanders to remain on their land** 

 The ABOVE project, led by University of Cambridge researchers Liu and Edmonds, involves field campaigns to Papua New Guinea volcanoes Rabaul and Manam to deploy UAV gas sensors and train local people in these techniques. Manam is a small island with > 2000 people, who are regularly evacuated to the mainland during eruptions every few years \(there have been nine since 2000\). Islanders live with extreme volcanic risk, as permanent relocation is unacceptable because the island is essential to their way of life and rehoming on the mainland brings risk of conflict. The UAV technology and training provided by the ABOVE project offers a means for them to remain. An ABOVE project video includes interviews with local people: 

 ‘*Those major eruptions \[in 2004\] were never addressed properly by the government… we have been waiting for 15 years and nothing is happening… We are regarded as IDPs – Internally Displaced Persons \- on our own land*.’\[E11\]. 

 The ABOVE project provides equipment and training to the local volcano observatory to continue measurements of gas fluxes using UAVs. One representative from each province in Papua New Guinea came to the training workshop in February 2019 and, thereafter, successfully lobbied provincial governments for additional funding \[E1\]. The islanders had relied on visual monitoring, but now fly UAVs over the volcano to monitor gas flux and activity to see what and who is most at risk, allowing them to remain on their own land.

 Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The PROFHER trial \(PROximal Fracture of the Humerus: Evaluation by Randomisation\) was funded \(c. GBP1,500,000\) by the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\). The trial produced high\-grade evidence that surgery did not improve patient\-reported outcome \(Oxford Shoulder Score\) in adults up to two years after a displaced proximal humeral fracture, compared to conservative management \(sling immobilisation\). Furthermore, the health economics analysis showed that surgery was not cost\-effective. The clinical\- and cost\-effectiveness findings formed the definitive evidence for the 2016 National Institute of Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) guidelines for the treatment of these fractures: a strong recommendation was made for conservative management, as no additional benefit was indicated with surgery. A 2017 survey of UK National Health Service \(NHS\) specialist orthopaedic and trauma surgeons found that around half of respondents had changed practice based on the trial results by operating on fewer eligible patients, with greater confidence in treatment decision making. Around one\-third of those who had not changed practice were already managing patients non\-surgically. This group reported that the PROFHER trial findings provided evidence\-based support for their treatment decisions and had also aided discussions with patients. The trial has also informed international practice, with examples from Denmark.

 Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Approximately 5% of fractures in adults in high income countries are those of the proximal humerus \(top end of the upper arm bone\), with over 700,000 occurring worldwide annually. Also called “broken shoulders”, these serious fractures occur mainly in older people. They are very painful and debilitating, often in the long\-term. Most fractures are treated conservatively by immobilising the affected arm, such as with an arm sling, followed by physical exercises.  Surgery typically involves fixation with a plate and screws, or partial or total joint replacement. Although surgery is indicated for very seriously disrupted fractures, prior to the PROFHER trial there was a trend for increased surgery in the largest subgroup of ‘displaced’ fractures; around 40% of the fracture population. Prior to the publication and incorporation of the PROFHER trial findings, a regularly updated Cochrane review conducted by Handoll et al. found insufficient evidence to inform on the use of surgery for these fractures. The review also noted several abandoned and under\-recruited trials, illustrating the major challenges in conducting randomised trials on this topic. 

 Initiated by Teesside University \(trial sponsor\), a trial group of orthopaedic surgeons \(lead applicant: Amar Rangan, James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough and Visiting Professor at Teesside University\) and methodologists \(University lead, Handoll; and members of the York Trials Unit, trial management\) received NIHR funding to conduct the PROFHER trial \(PROximal Fracture of the Humerus: Evaluation by Randomisation\). The trial was registered on 25 March 2008: http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN50850043. Handoll was the lead regarding co\-ordinating and writing\-up the various topic\-specific and methodological aspects of the trial protocol, published in 2009 \[3.1\]. This contribution included working with physiotherapist Goodchild \(formerly at James Cook University Hospital\) and Hanchard \(physiotherapist and Reader at Teesside University\) to develop a patient information leaflet for initial self\-care, as well as a physiotherapy protocol; rehabilitation aspects reported in \[3.2\]. Handoll was a core member of the trial management group. The PROFHER trial involved a substantial investment in terms of GBP1,500,000 funding through the NIHR and via contributions from hundreds of people, including surgeons and other clinicians at the participating sites. 

 The PROFHER trial recruited 250 adults from the orthopaedic departments \(fracture clinics or wards\) of 32 acute care UK NHS hospitals between September 2008 and April 2011 within 3 weeks of sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus. Patients were randomly assigned to surgery \(fracture fixation or humeral head replacement\) or non\-surgical treatment \(sling immobilization\). Standard outpatient and community\-based rehabilitation was provided to both groups. The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score – a patient\-reported outcome with a range of 0\-48, with higher scores indicating better outcomes – reported at 6, 12, and 24 months. The results showed no significant difference between groups for the mean Oxford Shoulder Score averaged over 2 years of follow\-up \(39.07 points for the surgical group vs 38.32 points for the nonsurgical group, a difference of 0.75 points \[95% CI, \-1.33 to 2.84 points\]; P = 0.48\). Also, there were no significant differences between groups in physical and mental health\-related quality of life. The data did not support the trend of increased surgery for patients with displaced fractures of the proximal humerus. 

 Handoll was the lead author and responsible for the contents and structure of the comprehensive account of the trial published in the funder’s journal \[3.3\] as well as in the leading medical journal, JAMA \[3.4\]. The health economic analysis was published separately and was centred on UK NHS costs \[3.5\]. A cost\-utility analysis examined differences between surgery and non\-surgery treatments in costs and quality adjusted life years \(QALYs\) at two years. The QALY is a commonly used metric in health economic analyses and combines quality and quantity of life into a single score. The QALY can be calculated using a utility value \(quality of life\) between 1 = perfect health and 0 = dead: a person living in perfect health for one year will have 1 QALY. Medical treatments are evaluated on a cost per QALY basis. The health economic analysis revealed that patients in the surgery group accumulated greater costs and slightly lower QALYs than patients randomised to non\-surgery \[3.5\]. On average, the surgical intervention cost GBP1,758 more per patient. The probability of surgery being cost effective was less than 10% at the threshold used by NICE for ‘willingness to pay’ of GBP£20,000 per QALY. The analysis showed that surgical treatment is not cost effective for most displaced fractures of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck in the United Kingdom's NHS. It was estimated that a 50% reduction in surgery would equate to an annual cost saving of GBP2,500,000 for NHS England. 

 In 2010, Handoll et al. successfully applied for additional funding to extend follow\-up to five years. Oxford Shoulder Score data were available for 164, 155 and 149 participants at three, four and five years, respectively. There were no substantial differences between surgical and non\-surgical treatment groups at each timepoint. The results at five years were consistent with those at two years \[3.6\]. Thus, overall, the results do not support the trend of increased surgery for patients with these fractures.

 Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The PROFHER trial underpinned clinical guidelines and altered the practice of surgeons treating proximal fractures of the humerus. The trial findings provided the definitive evidence for treatment recommendations for these fractures in the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) guideline NG38, 2016 \[5.1\]. Professionals and practitioners are expected to take NICE guidelines ‘fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service’ \[5.1, p.19\]. 

 The full report for the assessment and management of non\-complex fractures by NICE describes the trial \(cited as Handoll et al. \[3.3\]\) as ‘a well conducted UK based trial’, with the Guideline Development Group indicating that ‘a strong recommendation should be made for the conservative approach as no additional benefit was indicated with surgery’ \[5.2, p.222\]. As a result of this pivotal underpinning research, these new guidelines state specifically that ‘for adults \(skeletally mature\) with displaced low energy proximal humerus fractures: offer non\-surgical management for definitive treatment of uncomplicated injuries’ \[5.2, p.221\]. 

 Handoll et al.’s health economic analysis \[3.5\] was the only research identified by the NICE Guideline Development Group comparing conservative treatment to surgery for cost\-effectiveness, with this evidence ‘assessed as directly applicable with minor limitations’ \[5.2, p. 223\]. The results showed a slight increase in QALYs \(0.01\) for the conservative treatment group as well as a relative reduction in overall costs \(GBP1,758 per patient\). Therefore, the NICE Guideline Development Group concluded that the clinical effectiveness evidence was consistent with the cost effectiveness data and ‘agreed that conservative treatment should be recommended for people with fractures of the proximal humerus’ \[5.2, p. 223\]. 

 Subsequently, Handoll et al. sought evidence of the influence of the PROFHER trial results on surgeons’ clinical practice \[5.3: selected for REF2021, cited 10 times on Web of Science\]. They conducted a survey of UK NHS specialist orthopaedic and trauma surgeons, using a questionnaire piloted with six orthopaedic surgeons using a ‘think aloud’ process. The questionnaire was distributed online to surgeon members of the British Orthopaedic Association and British Elbow and Shoulder Society. Complete responses were obtained from 265 orthopaedic and trauma surgeons who treat patients with proximal humeral fractures. The results showed that around half \(137/265\) of respondents had changed practice entirely \(n=90\) or partly \(n=47\) based on the PROFHER trial results, by operating on fewer eligible patients \[5.3\]. A substantial number of this group of surgeons also reported that the PROFHER trial had given them greater confidence in making a decision to treat non\-operatively \(n=22\) \[5.3, p. 596\]. Additional free\-text feedback from surgeons included reduced concerns around liability as their practice was now evidence\-based further to publication of the PROFHER trial \[5.3, p. 596\]. The evaluation also revealed that some surgeons used the trial findings to ‘inform a patient\-centred approach, for example, through discussions of treatment options with patients in light of the trial findings \(21 cases\)’ \[5.3, p. 596\]. A total of 43 of the 128 respondents who had not changed practice were already managing patients without surgery, and a number of these reported that the PROFHER trial findings provided evidence\-based support for their treatment decisions \(n=19\) and had also aided discussions with patients \(n=9\). Overall, the survey showed that high\-grade evidence from definitive randomised clinical trials like PROFHER was the most important influence on surgeons’ decisions to change practice \[5.3\]. 

 Testimonials from two consultant surgeons in Denmark demonstrate that the PROFHER trial has had influence beyond the UK, with the trial shaping practice within their institutions to a non\-operative approach to treating proximal fracture of the humerus \[5.4, 5.5\]. One testimonial pointed to national guidance in Denmark: ‘we have agreed within the Danish Orthopaedic Society on a non\-operative approach to most displaced proximal humeral fractures’ \[5.4\]. 

 In summary, the underpinning research – in the form of a pivotal randomised clinical trial – provided the definitive evidence for the NICE treatment recommendations for displaced proximal humerus fractures. The trial findings changed the practice of surgeons treating these fractures in the UK NHS and beyond, resulting in a reduction in unnecessary surgery and large potential cost savings.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 By taking a functional physics approach whereby the generation of knowledge of laser physics and light\-matter interactions is applied to problems identified by industrial partners, we have enabled the launch of a new laser system, generated novel laser\-based processes and diagnostics, and produced a high\-quality workforce that supports the UK laser industry. Specifically, our research partnership with Luxinar Ltd has enabled the launch of their ultrashort pulse, high average power, laser and it has taken them into new markets \- helping them maintain a specialised workforce of 160 and a turnover of £40m. Working with The Welding Institute, we have contributed to the reduction of the need for digital displays that use the rare element indium \(identified as an “at risk” material by the EU\). Equally, by developing fume sampling techniques for laser processes, we have increased the capability of BOFA Ltd to address workplace safety. Lastly, we have generated a talent\-pipeline that transitions alumni of the group into laser\-based industries, which supports the UK National Strategy for Laser\-based Manufacturing. Our longstanding cooperation with laser companies in our region also underpins the UK’s capacity in this key industry in the North East of England. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Hull Laser Group \(HLG\) has a long history and built its first laser in 1965. At that time, the research emphasis focused on the early development of laser devices and the Hull group accumulated a series of key breakthroughs \- including the world record for the generation of the shortest laser wavelength. Laser manufacturing companies spun out of these early research activities and the university began a sustained relationship with industrial partners in this field. The activities of the group shifted to encompass laser applications by the mid\-1980s whereby the applied physics expertise of the Hull academics was focussed on understanding the interaction of light with materials. Our three current research areas that underpin the impact case are: \(2.1\) non\-linear processes with ultra\-short laser pulses, \(2.2\) laser irradiance regimes for glass processing, and \(2.3\) non\-reciprocity in laser irradiation of polymers. 

 2.1 Non\-linear processes with ultra\-short laser pulses 

 Innovations in laser design have continued throughout the group’s history and our focus has evolved from predominantly gas laser research to solid state sources \[1\]. The sub nanosecond nature of this solid\-state laser naturally lead to studies of even shorter pulse interactions in the femtosecond regime \[2\]. Utilising non\-linear, two\-photon, absorption allowed laser light to couple with normally transparent materials. In the case of reference \[2\], this was a cancer treatment drug and greater penetration into the tumour could be achieved using this novel process. Utilising this mechanism in other transparent materials also generates laser\-induced absorption and dielectric breakdown. In this way, crack free machining of “difficult” glasses was achieved \[3\]. 

 2.2 Laser irradiance regimes for glass processing 

 Increased use of chemically toughened glasses in displays \(e.g., “Gorilla glass” in tablets and mobile phones\) together with a need for ever more complex geometries \(e.g., display formats and holes for sensors\) is challenging traditional glass machining techniques. Earlier pioneering work from Hull Laser Group laid out the principles of laser\-induced cracking in glasses. Utilising this knowledge in the current REF period, we have shown that ultrashort pulses can avoid micro crazing and produce defect free features \[3\]. Surface forming poses a further problem if optical quality finishes are required. We have studied the effect of high laser intensities in producing colour centres in glass and the concomitant change in chemical reactivity. Utilising a hybrid laser\-chemical procedure, we have enabled surface figuring suitable for novel, Laplacian, optical elements \[4\]. 

 2.3 Non\-reciprocity in laser irradiation of polymers 

 Many digital displays rely upon indium tin oxide, but the use of indium represents a risk factor for steady supply due to its scarcity. The display and photovoltaic industries can be made more resilient to this risk by developing indium\-free alternatives. The current candidate materials require heat treatment to increase their conductivity, but this then precludes the use of temperature sensitive substrates such as polymers for flexible electronics and low\-cost photovoltaics. However, rapid laser heating on timescales shorter than the rate of decomposition allows the survival of these materials at higher temperatures. Using our understanding of laser\-polymer interactions \[5\] we have developed a laser\-based process that localises the heating in space and time to enable the use of plastic substrates in devices \[6\].

This research impact helps laser companies to remain financially viable in a harsh, competitive market, and, in time, to develop their market share and proliferation. Our impact is also manifest through the development and retention of long\-term research\-relationships with high profile companies that specialise in laser\-based technologies and their applications. 

 **4.1 New product launch for Luxinar Ltd.** 

 Our research and development work with Luxinar Ltd emerges from longstanding relationships and collaboration with the company and its core employees through their evolution from Laser Applications Ltd, to Lumonics, to Coherent \(Hull\), and to Rofin\-Sinar \[A\]. This relationship has spanned 40 years of laser development and our more recent laser\-material interaction research. It enabled Luxinar to maintain and grow its market share in a very competitive industry. The benefits of this collaboration led to the construction of a joint University of Hull / Luxinar Laser Applications Laboratory in January 2017 \(with investment of around £350,000, including £120,000 and the loan of a £140,000 laser from Luxinar, and £50,000 from the University\). This development allowed Luxinar to move beyond gas laser manufacturing to produce a portfolio of solid\-sate ultrashort pulse lasers. These lasers offer higher pulse repetition rates, at shorter pulse durations and higher average power than is currently available in a system suitable for industrial deployment. Specifically, the collaboration has facilitated the development of the new LXR100 product \[B\], launched in February 2020. The digital display industry is a major target for the applications of this laser. By modelling the laser interaction with glass, the University was able to define the required specifications for this laser as part of its design process. This ensured that the research and development investment of Luxinar was focussed successfully on developing a device with the correct characteristics to succeed in a specific, target market. 

 The technology and innovation director at Luxinar explains \[A\]: 

 *“Luxinar has invested £3.4m, with the aim to recoup our investment by 2023. The collaboration with Hull aided both the generation of the required specification whilst contributing technical know\-how and insights into the development process.”* 

 Furthermore, the University/Luxinar Joint Applications Laboratory now provides the capability for the company to optimise the software control to fulfil specific customer requirements in real world scenarios. This is essential in a competitive market and Luxinar’s continued success supports its £40m turnover and 160 highly\-skilled employees. Luxinar’s director agrees: 

 *“…the ability to collaborate with the laser group at the University of Hull has complimented and enhanced our technical capability thereby ensuring greater resilience and helping secure high value photonics manufacturing within the UK.”* \[A\] 

 **4.2 Laser applications and safety** 

 The UK Roadmap for Laser\-based Manufacturing, published by the EPSRC CIM\-LbPP and the Association of Industrial Laser Users, calls for an increase in the use of lasers to enable the UK to compete internationally. The Hull Laser Group underpins this roadmap through our interactions with our industrial partners and, in this way, the importance of our work continues to develop. 

 Dr Snelling was invited by The Welding Institute \(TWI\) to lead the laser interaction work for the H2020 Indium Free Novel Technology \(Infinity\) programme. This project required heat treatment of thin film compounds already formulated by TWI, whilst not compromising the integrity of a polymer substrate suitable for flexible electronics. The HLG has a wide range of laser sources that cover wavelengths from the vacuum ultraviolet to the far infrared, and pulse durations from milliseconds to femtoseconds. This facility, unavailable elsewhere in the UK, allowed the HLG to study the physics of the laser interaction, and to define appropriate laser characteristics \(rather than reformulating the chemistry to match a preselected laser source\). The success of the Infinity programme in developing such a tailored laser process has reduced the need for indium in display and photovoltaic devices. Studying the physics of the interaction of light with matter \(rather than preselecting a laser for the process\) is a defining feature of how the Hull Laser Group works. This was recognised by the TWI Manager – New Business Streams, who wrote: 

 *“Engagement between this group and TWI has demonstrably enabled industrial challenges to be successfully addressed in a far more rapid and satisfactory manner than would otherwise have been achieved.”* \[C\] 

 The HLG has paid sustained attention to the fume hazard associated with laser processing of materials. This research interest dates back to the first EU programme on laser safety in the 1990s. More recently, a 2009 Knowledge Transfer Partnership on the filtration of laser\-generated gases and particulates was undertaken with Purex International Ltd. This successful project, together with outputs from the H2020 Infinity work package on fume, brought our research to the attention of BOFA International Ltd \(fume and dust extraction leaders\) and generated our current research collaboration with them on fume capture devices. We have used the fume collection techniques and analysis protocols that we have developed to jointly produce an in\-factory, laser\-produced fume sampling system. The research and development manager at BOFA says: 

 *“It affords us the unique position of being able to offer testing of laser installations, and from it ensure the correct specification of extractor is used in order to ensure compliance with ever tightening emission regulations.”* \[D\] 

 The international scale of BOFA’s business and the global reach of their products ensures that our research impact will improve the safety of many other industries such as canning, packaging, soldering, and clothing. BOFA consider that working with Hull has: 

 *“…embedded knowledge of the sampling and testing process into the* company and opened new areas of investigation. *We learned about analytical techniques and processes that were previously not part of our toolkit. In this way, the collaboration transformed the way that our company considers laser\-generated fume.*” \[D\] 

 **4.3 Talent pipeline** 

 As identified by the UK national strategy for laser\-based manufacturing, the UK lags other manufacturing nations in the wider industrial uptake of laser technologies. This deficiency cannot be addressed without an appropriately trained and skilled workforce. The wider range of laser systems researched at Hull \(compared to the more limited range used at some institutions\), together with our decades of collaboration with laser\-based industries, puts HLG in a unique position to equip students with the skills and experiences that are tailored to the needs of industrial employers. This capacity was formalised in the EPSRC\-funded Laser Applications in Micro\-machining and Processing \(LAMP\) MSc that ran from 2001 to 2007 and was then incorporated into MPhys final year modules. The technology and innovation director of Luxinar Ltd says of his team trained at Hull, that: 

 *“The skills and knowledge they have learned from Hull’s laser research have greatly contributed to our product and process development.”* \[A\] 

 North\-Eastern England is a region with proportionately few high\-tech laser manufacturers and a relatively weak socio\-economic profile. In this context, our undergraduates and research students underpin recruitment to local high\-technology companies and reinforce the region’s development. Quoting Luxinar again: 

 *“Attracting high quality graduates and postgraduates with the necessary skills and knowledge into the Humber region has been extremely challenging for a number of years. Therefore, having a local educational establishment of the quality of the University of Hull has been pivotal to our success.”* \[A\] 

 Equally, alumni of the HLG are currently deploying their laser\-related expertise at companies and institutions around the UK and abroad \[E\]. In summary, our talent pipeline in laser technologies has underpinned industries regionally and nationally. The sustainable relationships we have built over the past decades make us confident that the impact described here will grow further and contribute additionally to the UK’s laser expertise.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Middlesex Computer Science undertakes world\-leading research to improve the quality of software systems development. Today, quality of software is dependent upon large\-scale, networked, semi\-autonomous interdependent systems. Such systems no longer have fixed behaviour and must invariably adapt to achieve their intended function and even change function over time. Consequently, software architects and designers require higher level abstract tools to understand system complexity and interdependencies. Simulation and modelling are core aspects of such work. Beyond software, similar methods of working are also applicable to engineering problems associated with large\-scale infrastructures. During this REF research period, these approaches have coalesced around the notion of a Digital Twin \(DT\). Generally, a DT is a virtual representation of a real\-world physical artifact or system that is linked to enable use of real\-time data to enable learning, reasoning and dynamically adapting for improved decision making. DTs can be of many types depending upon the features in play and the purpose for which they are defined. 

 This section describes <ins> **two**</ins> broad directions of research activity associated with what is now widely known as a Digital Twin \(DT\): first, our work on software engineering and, second, our more recent work on structural health monitoring. The integration of model\-based software engineering and the proving of conceptual advances in complex scenarios is a hallmark of our approach to DT research. 

 <ins> **\(a\)</ins> <ins>Software Engineering:**</ins> Barn and Clark’s work has developed language\-based simulation and modelling techniques to design, analyse and adapt the quality\-assured development of complex enterprise systems. After initial research on lightweight methods for enterprise modelling, the entirety of this work has been performed in collaboration with TCS and its research lab in Pune. Critically, it is not *just* an application of research, but much more: it is industry and academia working in collaboration to address emerging industry\-scale problems. Barn and Clark’s contribution has led to new methods and technologies, the development of which is described in the rest of this section. The collaboration illustrates how the research has responded and adapted to the emerging sub\-discipline of DT that first became significant in 2016. 

 Existing approaches to digital twin representation of enterprise modelling are not suitable as a basis for simulation and analysis.  Barn and Clark’s collaborative research directly led to the construction of an executable modelling language called LEAP \(Lightweight Precise Enterprise Architecture\), together with a toolset for enterprise simulation \[R1\]. This research was reported in India’s premier Software Engineering Conference – ISEC, attended by representatives from most of India’s premier industrial research labs. ISEC has an acceptance rate of around 13\-15% and is notable for the representation of industrial researchers. The LEAP work was identified by TCS as potential technology that could be exploited by TCS as they embarked on a research strategy focused on idea of the Model Driven Organization \(MDO\). LEAP thus formed the basis of a collaborative initiative between Middlesex and TCS Research leading to a conceptual research paper published in the Core\-ranked A conference \- HICSS \[R2\]. MDO was promoted by a series of dedicated workshops at international conferences. MDO subsequently became integral to the research strategy for TCS software engineering research area. 

 From 2013 to date, Barn has been hosted annually by TCS Research in Pune India for two weeks to co\-develop research that has had a direct influence on the TCS Research strategy and their interactions with clients. These visits led to the co\-creation of a technology\-based method for organization modelling and decision\-making, reported in the leading ACM/IEEE Models Conference series \[R3\].  This work was a development derived directly from the original work in LEAP. The key contribution of this work is a conceptual meta\-model expressed in terms of goals, execution traces, simulation levers, and agents, for constructing enterprise models that can be used to aid decision\-makers. Aspects of this work were also executed by TCS’s funding of a distance learning PhD student, a senior scientist at TCS, to undertake doctoral studies at Middlesex. Souvik Barat completed in 2018 and his work, supervised by Barn, led to the development of methodology for enterprise decision making. This annual collaboration, initially seeded by the groundwork of the research published in \[R1\] has led to new products being marketed by TCS \[S7, S8\]. 

 To validate the conceptual model, a number of case studies were developed and reported in publications. A particular interest was focused on the use of the technology for modelling socio\-technical contexts. Some of that research used ESL and its underlying conceptual model in an exploratory case study examining India’s demonetization strategy of 2016. This validation would provide confidence later in the work done on COVID\-19 reported below. 

 Clark led on the development of a technology to support the modelling and decision\-making approach. The agent\-based technology takes the form of a novel programming language called ESL and an associated development platform called EDB \( [http://www.esl\-lang.org](http://www.esl-lang.org/), \[R4\]\) both of which are open source. The platform was then extended and used in a Digital Twin context with research being reported in \[R5\]. 

 Following expansion and evolution of DT research, in 2019, Middlesex established the London Digital Twin Research Centre Centre \( [https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdt.mdx.ac.uk%2F&data=04%7C01%7CB.Barn%40mdx.ac.uk%7Cb9ac1274a5224106a3c108d8eeb7b7c8%7C38e37b88a3a148cf9f056537427fed24%7C0%7C0%7C637521820114988075%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=IsAoWKiV4TDoIV%2F793TqFKVS9lHrCLWwy2%2FT65uqN8E%3D&reserved=0)\) . Further work now includes: Building Information Management, and Smart Factory \(working closely with Festo and Siemens\) as well as consolidating work on Structural Health Monitoring. The Centre’s ethos is that modelling gains from application, complexity spurs research innovation, and international collaboration enables both. 

 <ins> **\(b\)</ins> <ins>Digital Twins for Structural Health Monitoring</ins> <ins>\(SHM\)</ins><ins>:</ins><ins>**</ins> 

 A well\-documented use for Digital Twins is in the area of structural health monitoring of large infrastructure artefacts such as bridges and buildings. In 2018, Prof. Nguyen received funding for two international collaboration grants \- from the Newton Fund \( [https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/?page\_id=36](https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/?page_id=36)\) and from the UKIERI \( [https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/?page\_id=37](https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/?page_id=37)\). 

 In collaboration with the University of Transport and Communications \(UTC\), Vietnam, Prof. Nguyen has been addressing the problem of how to detect damage and predict future maintenance requirements of large infrastructures such as bridges due to aging, environmental change, vehicular loads and other human\-induced factors. 

 The research reported in \[R6\] addressed the issue of inherent high dimensionality of measured structure data in raw time series sensory signals for SHM using different deep learning techniques to assess the reliability as well as the trade\-off between accuracy and of different deep learning models, assisting the relevant stakeholders to make informed decision in maintenance and operation of bridges. 

 The work in \[R7\] makes use of physical features embedded in raw data and an elaborated hybrid deep learning model, featuring two algorithms—convolutional neural network \(CNN\) and long\-short term memory \(LSTM\). Building on advances in algorithms for health monitoring uniting machine learning, structural mechanics and signal processing Nguyen developed a novel hybrid approach that delivered highly accurate results in detecting damage and its severity even for multiple damage scenarios. The resulting method has been a practical end\-to\-end data\-driven framework used for defining a Digital Twin for automatically monitoring the operational state of structures. This framework is reported in the *IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering* \[R7\]. These works were integrated in a Cloud based Digital Twin platform \( [http://3.140.199.12/](http://3.140.199.12/)\) that was critical to the repair plan development of the Thăng Long bridge in Hanoi, Vietnam by the Ministry of Transport resulting in savings of £1.5 million on repair costs and benefits of £7.6 million in economy \[S12\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 International and industry collaborations have shaped Middlesex’s leadership in applied digital twin research. It has been arrived at from two different starting points but shares the underlying principle of *model based design*. This section outlines the impacts from both strands of work. 

 <ins> **\(a\)</ins> <ins>Impacts arising from our</ins> <ins>Software Engineering</ins> <ins>research</ins><ins>:**</ins> 

 The work in software engineering, closely developed with TCS, is an example of a pioneering research collaboration in an emerging area of technology between academia and industry where knowledge transfer is continuous and facilitated by annual sabbatical residencies, presentations to TCS staff, joint publication, and supervision of TCS research staff. 

 TCS Research is a pioneer in core technology infrastructure to support Model Driven Engineering \(MDE\) and has delivered several large business critical software systems using this infrastructure for almost 20 years. They recognized that MDE could be applied to address all aspects of an enterprise such as vision, mission, goal, strategies and operational processes. These research questions were congruent with the LEAP research conducted by Barn and Clark \[R1\] and it is this that shaped the collaboration. The \[S1\] letter from the Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of TCS confirms the basis of the collaboration, the ongoing work and the benefit of contributions of Barn and Clark to TCS activity. 

 After the initial influence of R1, the research collaboration between Middlesex and TCS was formally noted in a memorandum of cooperation. A co\-designed research agenda was initiated, with the aim that it should lead directly to products for creating agent\-based simulation models of enterprises. The research roadmap was conceptualized in the MDO vision paper \[R2\] and then formalized into a research roadmap report for TCS customers and shareholders \[S3\]. 

 As a result of this research collaboration, TCS has been able to raise their profile in the area of enterprise modelling and simulation.  This has had a positive impact on client satisfaction and loyalty, the generation of new revenue streams and their reputation for research\-led innovation. Specific examples include: 

-  Development of the TCS world\-leading digital twin product – TwinX™ based on the meta model developed by Barn and Clark. The TwinX™ product is now being being provided as solution by TCS to companies such as VodafoneZiggo and has a product manager assigned – Kaustav Bhattacharya \[S2\]. 

-  Proof\-of\-concept demonstrators. The technology arising from the research has been showcased by TCS using proof\-of\-concept demonstrators \[S1\]. Case studies covering various business optimisation requirements based on  ESL \[research reported in R7\] were developed. These included:  Optimizing operation of a parcel sorting terminal;  Optimization of order\-to\-activation process of a telecommunications company using digital twin based on ESL; and Optimized stock\-replenishment for shops in a retail supply chain using digital twin based on ESL. 

-  New Business.  The extension of ESL with machine learning capabilities described in \[R5\] has been applied by TCS Research to a commercial problem provided by a European supermarket client. The company has, to date, been using a system\-dynamics approach to simulation which takes several weeks to stabilize and produce a solution. Using the ESL\-based machine learning simulation, TCS Research has been able to demonstrate the reduction of the stabilization time to a matter of hours. In this case, both the approach and the ESL technology have supported TCS in promoting TCS Research to existing and new clients \[S1\]. 

-  Conceptual scope in company R&D.   TCS research labs incorporated MDO as one of their research themes as described in their promotional literature to clients and shareholders \[S2\]. 

-  Barn and Clark co\-supervised a TCS Research employee on a doctoral programme at Middlesex from 2015\-18. \[S4\].  The successful PhD has diffused ESL knowledge within the TCS through the recruitment of three new researchers specifically to develop local expertise in ESL. This was seen as critical for transferring research knowledge to the end user and building capacity in digital twin simulation at TCS. 

 To reach a broader audience beyond research, Barn is a co\-editor of a book initiated by TCS Research ‘Advanced Digital Architectures for Model\-Driven Adaptive Enterprises’ with IGI\-Global. The book contains by\-invitation contributions from industry leaders in the field and aims to establish TCS as a thought leader in the field of model driven enterprises and simulation\-based methods \[S5\]. The book is aimed at practitioners seeking to understand digital twin technology. It was promoted via a post by Sankha Som, Chief Innovation Evangelist to his 500\+ connections on LinkedIn. His post reported on the collaboration with Middlesex regarding Enterprise Modelling and stated how this “ **area has already made its way into Enterprise Digital Twins that we are developing for various domains such as Telecom…”** \[S8\]. 

 Our earlier research had already indicated that the design approach and the ESL technology was viable in socio\-technical systems \[R6\]. In early April 2020, colleagues at TCS developed a local Java implementation of ESL that originally developed at Middlesex. The TCS implementation has been productized as the Java TwinX™ Library. This software has been used to model scenarios for non\-pharmaceutical interventions for the COVID\-19 pandemic in the Pune region by working closely with a local Pune based NGO \(PrayasPune.org\). The fine\-grained analysis of COVID\-19 pandemic management was led by Dr Souvik Barat using the TwinX™ Java library based on ESL. Details of the simulation are described in \[S7\] where the role of Dr Barat as lead on the TCS team is documented. This \(ongoing – March 2021\) activity has been reported in a Pune\-based newspaper and in national newspapers and is shown in \[S6\]. On 03/03/2021, the national TV channel, MirrorNow, ran a debate about Maharashtra’s recent COVID\-19 pandemic spike in infections \(available at:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x48G7\-bOvPY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x48G7-bOvPY)\). On this programme, Dr Abhay Shukla \(national convenor, the People’s Health Movement\-India\), noted: 

 *“The TCS\-Prayas model that has been published, it has predicted the second wave back in mid\-December, at a pretty accurate level.”* \[S9\] 

###  <ins>\(b\)</ins> <ins>Impacts from Digital Twins for Structural Health Monitoring:</ins> 

 The digital twin developments arising from the TCS collaboration and collaboration with Prof. Nguyen led to the Faculty of Science and Technology establishing the  [London Digital Twin Research Centre \(LDTRC\).](https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/) Research outputs \[R6, R7\] from an international collaboration funded by the Newton Fund and UKIERI were brought to the attention of Ministry of Transport of the Vietnamese Government.  The Ministry of Transport collaborated with a project team from Middlesex and the University of Transport and Communications, Hanoi. Using the conceptual and modelling developments reported in section 2. The collaboration has led to: 

-  Preparation of a repair plan by the research team for the Thăng Long bridge in Hanoi, Vietnam by the Ministry of Transport resulting in savings of £1.5 million on repair costs. 

-  Early re\-opening of the Thăng Long bridge helped reduce traffic flow resulting in an estimated further benefit to the economy of Hanoi of around £7.6 million. 

-  Policy development in digital transformation for infrastructures in Vietnam. The Ministry of Transport intends to use the digital twin technology developed by Middlesex and UTC on other bridges including Nhật Tân bridge, Cần Thơ bridge, and  Mỹ Thuận bridge 

 The engagement and utilisation of the research \[R6, R7\] was essential in reducing the maintenance costs and was reported as critical in policy development in helping Vietnam towards digital transformation for infrastructures \[S10\], which was reported on the national TV programme “Digital Nation” in Vietnam on 7<sup>th</sup> March 2021 \[S11\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Rabies post\-exposure prophylaxis \(PEP\) is a vital tool for reducing rabies deaths worldwide but access to this life\-saving treatment is restricted by a lack of consensus, and thus investment, in appropriate treatment regimens. UofG research has provided epidemiological and cost\-effectiveness modelling that underpins changes to World Health Organization \(WHO\) policy on rabies PEP regimens. The WHO’s streamlined policy, together with UofG models of the impact of investment in PEP, were instrumental in the 2018 decision by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to add the rabies PEP to their 2021–2025 investment strategy, supporting access to rabies PEP across 57 developing countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 UofG is at the forefront of research to eliminate canine rabies. Its internationally recognised researchers and rabies programme have made landmark contributions to understanding rabies transmission and to the development and implementation of rabies\-control measures. In regions where rabies is still common, rabies PEP is given to people bitten by suspect dogs within 24 hrs and is essential for preventing the fatal onset of rabies. Several safe and effective regimens for PEP vaccine delivery are recommended by WHO, involving intramuscular \(IM\) or intradermal \(ID\) injection, often with multiple doses, but these regimens are inconsistently implemented and there are no clear recommendations about which to use in specific settings. In 2010, a Glasgow research team \(Hampson and Cleaveland\) developed a framework for comparing the cost\-effectiveness of a range of existing and experimental PEP vaccination regimens in urban and rural settings \[3.1\]. This study showed that PEP is a highly cost\-effective intervention in all cases, but that a universal switch from IM to ID delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims \[3.1\]. 

 To put the ongoing need for investment in rabies control into context, UofG research led by Hampson performed a comprehensive estimation of the global burden of endemic rabies \[3.2\]. This study revised the global human rabies mortality up to 59,000 per year and highlighted the disease’s economic burden, which is mainly due to premature death \(55%\), followed by direct costs of PEP \(20%\), and lost income whilst seeking PEP \(15.5%\). In 2017, the WHO commissioned Hampson, in recognition of her earlier study \[3.1\], to lead a quantitative assessment of the benefits and costs of PEP, pre\-exposure prophylaxis \(PrEP\), and rabies immunoglobulin \(RIG\) regimens \(the ‘vaccine model’\) \[3.3\]. Using the model defined in \[3.1\] as a basis, this study modelled a range of IM and ID regimens and concluded that a one\-week, two\-site ID injection was most cost\-effective, using between 25−85% fewer vaccine vials than IM injection owing to the smaller vaccine dose needed \[3.3\]. PrEP was considered unlikely to be an efficient use of resources. The study was reviewed by the WHO IVIR\-AC \(its immunization and vaccines related implementation research advisory committee\), which evaluates evidence for policy recommendations — the first time rabies PEP had undergone this process. 

 In parallel work, Hampson and Dr Caroline Trotter \(University of Cambridge\) led the first study to consider the impact of a major investment in rabies PEP by ‘Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance’ \(Gavi\)—a public\-private global health partnership that aims to increase access to vaccines in developing countries. To support the modelling, the WHO formed the WHO Modelling Consortium, consisting of 47 members and 30 academic and government institutions in 18 countries, led by Hampson and Trotter. Hampson and Trotter developed a multidisciplinary modelling framework \(the ‘impact model’\) \[3.4\] to integrate epidemiological and economic burden data generated by the consortium to predict the impact of investment into PEP treatment across 67 Gavi\-eligible countries and to model different outcome scenarios \[3.4\]. These scenarios included the scaling up of mass dog vaccinations and limiting wasteful PEP use by undertaking integrated bite case management—an approach to assessing the rabies status of the biting dog. Of vital importance to the impact model were UoG field studies that assessed how access to PEP can be improved \[3.5, 3.6\]. One study addressed uncertainty about treatment\-seeking behaviour in Tanzania and provided empirical estimates of the risk of death following a rabid dog bite in the absence of PEP or following late or incomplete PEP \[3.5\]. This vital work provided the first demonstration that even in a very resource\-poor country, ID vaccination can be easily adopted by health workers. A second study performed in Madagascar revealed the health improvements that are possible when PEP is provided for free: 84% of rabies\-exposed people sought PEP \(90% of whom completed\), while also reducing vaccine use by 50% through use of an ID regimen \[3.6\]. 

 The impact model showed that an investment to fund rabies PEP would prevent \~489,000 deaths of the 1 million forecasted to occur across 67 developing countries between 2021−2035, and that the number of vials needed globally \(73 million\) would remain the same if the ID regimen is used \[3.4\]. The study thus supports a case for increased investment in PEP by the global community and provides a tool to address specific scenarios needed by stakeholders.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Canine rabies is an infectious viral disease that is universally fatal following the onset of clinical symptoms. Rabies transmitted from domestic dogs is responsible for over 99% of human deaths from the disease. Annually, it causes \~59,000 human deaths worldwide, 3.7 million disability\-adjusted life years \(DALYs\) and costs the global economy USD8.6 billion. Effective and timely rabies PEP is a vitally important tool for reducing rabies deaths while canine rabies remains endemic. But in Africa, it is often unavailable in the communities that need it most, while in Asia it is resourced at great cost and used wastefully to treat all dog bites. 

 UofG modelling research has delivered vital data for international policy and investment strategies. This work provided a crucial framework that supported new global policy on rabies PEP by the WHO. This policy, together with the models that predict the impacts of PEP investment, provided the basis for a decision by Gavi \( [http://www.gavi.org/](http://www.gavi.org/)\) to add rabies PEP to their global vaccine investment strategy. Gavi brings together key global stakeholders, including WHO, the World Bank, UNICEF, governments of donor and developing countries, the vaccine industry in developed and developing countries, research agencies and philanthropic organizations, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which are each represented on Gavi’s executive board. 

 **Engagement with Gavi** 

 In 2013, Gavi considered investing in rabies PEP as part of their 2015−2021 vaccine investment strategy \(VIS\). In an expert consultation, to which UofG’s Prof. Hampson contributed, Gavi considered a range of factors but decided in November not to support rabies PEP. In their decision, they cited key knowledge gaps that limited the feasibility of vaccine implementation, including a lack of consensus on PEP treatment regimens \(10 different regimens were recommended and in use at the time\), uncertainty about PEP demand and treatment\-seeking behaviour, and the cost\-effectiveness of different investment scenarios \[A\]. Gavi instead elected to fund a USD2 million ‘learning agenda’, awarded to WHO, to address these gaps for their next investment decision in December 2018. 

 **Revision of WHO policy on rabies vaccines** 

 A crucial step towards Gavi investing in rabies vaccination was for WHO to develop an updated consensus position statement on rabies PEP to address discrepancies between its earlier recommendations \(2010\) and how PEP was being used in endemic regions, and to consider evidence for newly proposed regimens that could be evaluated. To facilitate this work, in 2016 the WHO established a Strategic Advisory Group of Experts \(SAGE\) working group on rabies vaccines whose role was to develop practical and feasible recommendations to prevent human rabies. Concurrently, WHO used Gavi learning agenda funding to commission Hampson and Trotter to undertake two key modelling studies—the vaccine model \[3.3\] and the impact model \[3.5\]. In April 2017, WHO convened a meeting of the WHO Modelling Consortium to develop a consensus on the modelling approach and, through SAGE, to commission a portfolio of research from across the consortium, to address Gavi’s learning agenda and to feed data to the modelling studies led by Hampson and Trotter. 

 From June 2017, Hampson and Trotter discussed the findings of the vaccine model study with SAGE during several meetings, with SAGE endorsing a final, clear position on shorter and less costly PEP regimens in October 2017 \[B\]. The WHO published their position paper in April 2018 \[C\], ahead of Gavi’s investment shortlisting in June 2018 \[C\]. The WHO 2018 position paper draws on evidence about the magnitude of the global rabies burden established by Hampson et al. in 2015 \(global burden study\) \[3.2\] and the pivotal findings from the Gavi\-funded/WHO\-commissioned PEP modelling work \[3.3\], stating: “ *ID administration of rabies vaccines provides a cost\-saving and dose\-sparing alternative to IM vaccination. ID PEP regimens use at least 25% less vaccine vials than IM PEP regimens. As numbers of patients seen in clinics increase, ID regimens become increasingly cost\-effective, using up to 85% less vaccine vials”* \[C\]. A summary document published by the chair of SAGE explicitly sets out the updates to WHO’s position on vaccine regimens, stating that, “ *WHO now also recommends newer, shorter vaccine regimens that reduce costs, quantity of vaccine, and number of clinic visits…*” citing the UofG research \[3.1, 3.3, 3.4\] throughout as background to changes \[B\]. 

 **Gavi invest in rabies PEP in their 2021–2025 investment strategy** 

 Drawing on the IVIR\-AC validated PEP regimens, the impact modelling study \[3.4\] was able to offer key insights into the health impact \(future deaths averted\), costs and value for money of various scenarios of investment in these PEP regimens, both with and without additional rabies control programmes. Hampson & Trotter shared these findings iteratively and responsively with Gavi to address the board’s questions \[D\]. In November 2018, Gavi announced the addition of rabies PEP to their 2021−2025 investment strategy \[E\]. The Gavi board’s documentation cited as strategic rationale for the investment case: 1\) the WHO recommendations on the choice of regimen \(2\-site, 1\-week ID regimen\); and, 2\) the UofG\-Cambridge modelling projections, citing Hampson and Trotter \[D, F\]. The Head of Policy at Gavi said, “ *The estimates that Dr Hampson and Trotter used formed the basis of our projections on future demand for and impact of rabies PEP. This was a critical foundation for determining financial implications for Gavi, the relative cost\-effectiveness of rabies PEP and other important criteria to support the Board’s ultimate decision to approve the investment case*… *The synthesis of research contributed by UofG researchers helped to simplify what had been a complicated investment proposition—contextualising the global burden and identifying a universal and simple strategy*” \[D\]. 

 Rabies PEP is for the first time one of Gavi’s strategic goals, opening an investment window across the 57 countries eligible to apply for Gavi vaccine support for the next five years, which could prevent an estimated 489,000 deaths from rabies. 

 **Emerging secondary impacts on national vaccination policies** 

 Despite significant disruption to international discourse in 2020 ahead of the Gavi investment window, and in response to the WHO position on rabies PEP, several countries have changed, or are in the process of updating, their rabies PEP policies to bring them into line with WHO recommendations. Currently the Philippines, Nepal and Bhutan have revised guidelines; Bangladesh, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar and Cambodia are in the process of revising \[G\]. In India, Pakistan and Tanzania implementation has been more regional. In India the state of Himachal Pradesh  [issued new guidelines](http://www.nrhmhp.gov.in/sites/default/files/files/Approved%20%20HP-IDRV%2017-6-2019%20%20Rabies%20Guidelines.pdf) in response to the WHO position statement \[H\]. UofG researchers led by Hampson have also supported a switch to the 1\-week ID regimen in the 28 districts of South Eastern Tanzania and in the Mara region in North West Tanzania.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research into ecosystems and environments that support social innovation at GCU has led directly to the establishment of 21 Social Innovation Support Units in Latin America, Southeast Asia and five European regions, driving the development of new ideas to meet social needs that are unmet by economic markets. Devising a suite of tools and services and fully equipped co\-working maker spaces, attracting funding totalling EUR3m, these units/networks have directly enabled the creation, incubation and development of over 200 new social innovations and enterprises, from collaborative housing initiatives in Rio de Janeiro, to a mine clearance social enterprise in Phnom Penh. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In the past decade, social innovation has increasingly been considered an essential tool for identifying and responding to social challenges where the market and the public sector have failed. GCU researchers have developed an interdisciplinary programme of research around ‘Supportive ecosystems and environments for social innovation’ which has directly informed the design of Social Innovation Support Units. 

 In 2013\-14 we conducted systematic reviews of academic literature to conceptualise and theorise social innovation. Synthesis of this literature led us to theorise social innovation as involving new forms of interdisciplinary collaboration \(also including research users\) \(R1\); such collaboration leads to ‘better’ ideas \(or innovations\) for addressing social problems. In turn, these social innovations can lead to wider social change when implemented in participatory ways. \(R1, R2\) 

 Subsequently we sought to understand how social innovation can be supported. The EFESIIS Project \(Enabling the Flourishing and Evolution of Social Entrepreneurship for Innovative and Inclusive Societies \- GBP2m\) involved partners from 11 countries across Europe. Findings from an extensive survey of 258 stakeholders led to the development of a typology of ecosystems that can support the growth and flourishing of social innovation \(R3\). This was supplemented by an explanation of how social innovations \(e.g. social impact bonds\) interact with these ecosystems. \(R4\) 

 Research on social innovation ‘Hubs’ \(funded by EMES and Impact Hub in 2014\) sought to understand how they could be made more inclusive and attract more diverse participants. Findings showed that existing support structures favoured relatively privileged entrepreneurs rather than encompassing those in the greatest need. Recommendations were that Hubs should seek to offer financial support packages to less privileged participants; and ‘reach out’ into local communities through developing capacity, motivation and experience. \(R5\) 

 An in\-depth auto\-ethnographic case study on social innovation education \(in 2014\) focused on five management students developing links with practitioners \(from Nepal\), and supported by academics from different disciplinary backgrounds, as part of the Hult Challenge Competition \( [https://www.hultprize.org](https://www.hultprize.org/)\). Findings were that practice\-based co\-curricular activities are not an easy option for faculty: that students need extensive support, and that learning outcomes are enhanced through students working closely with those with a deep, contextualised familiarity of context in order to co\-produce solutions. \(R6\) 

 Findings from the research \(R1\-R6\) were combined to conceptualise a new approach to Knowledge Exchange which centred upon the development of a specialised Social Innovation Support Unit. The model aimed to: 

1.  Increase the generation of new social innovations, social enterprises and projects through the development of supportive ecosystems. \(R4, R1\) 

1.  Generate new collaborations between university academics, students, communities and social programmes at both a local and international level, in particular in low\- and middle\-income countries, benefitting more disadvantaged or marginalised \(potential\) entrepreneurs in resource poor environments. \(R6, R5\) 

1.  Provide all students with opportunities for entrepreneurial co\-curricular activities to enhance the curriculum. \(R6\) 

1.  Lead to new funding opportunities, including microcredit resources. \(R5\) 

1.  Facilitate university engagement with communities \(R6, R5, R1\), providing students and academics with the capacity, motivation and experience to do so. 

1.  Develop tools to demonstrate and measure impact as well as the potential to develop new innovative models for social change. \(R4\)

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Type of Impact: Contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity through the design and delivery of new products or services</ins> 

 GCU organised a series of international brokerage events to present its research and concept, culminating in  [‘Social Frontiers \- The next edge of social innovation research’](https://www.nesta.org.uk/event/social-frontiers/), hosted by GCU in collaboration with NESTA and the Young Foundation with 17 countries represented. This led to opportunities to apply its approach to social innovation support in low/middle income regions across the world. \(R1\) 

 <ins>Latin America</ins> 

 GCU\-led a consortium of 15 partners including eight universities from Colombia, Panama, Chile and Brazil, to form the Latin American Social Innovation Network \(LASIN \-  [https://lasinsisu.net/](https://lasinsisu.net/)\) attracting national and international funding, including European Commission’s CBHE Programme \(EUR992,578\). Applying GCU’s locally contextualised approach \(R2, R4\), the consortium established eight pilot ‘Social Innovation Support Units’ \(SISUs\). Each unit consisted of a maker space equipped with digital tools, 3D printing and VR resources \(with the value of approximately EUR30,000\) in order to prototype social innovation projects, at the disposal of students, academics and external stakeholders \(R1, R3\). They also organised regional social innovation awards programmes and six complementary workshops to mixed cohorts of a total of 180 students, academics, community groups and social innovators. \(R5, R6\) 

 As a result of their activities, between 2015 and 2018, the SISUs in Latin America have developed and incubated 127 social innovations/enterprises \(C1\), involving 275 students and community practitioners \(C2\). Innovations included: 

-  Brazil: Theatre In Communities; Universidade Das Quebradas 

-  Chile: Balloon Latam; Take A Hand 

-  Colombia: Music Schools‘ Network of Medellin; Park Of Life; Asakaa, The Greeting of Areandina 

-  Panama: School Farm Casiciaco Maria Haren; Youths United For Dialogue; Art With Cause 

 The SISUs continue to thrive as borne out by testimonials from the university partners: for example, from UFRJ, Brazil: ‘The social innovation work developed by GCU has had a continuous impact on the UFRJ and the way we are providing support to social innovators and developing social innovations in the city of Rio de Janeiro.’ \(C3\) 

 Two large\-scale conferences promoting the SISU model in Panama and Colombia with over 400 attendees from across Latin America increased LASIN membership to 67 institutions across the region. \(C4\) 

 A letter from the European Commission to EU Ambassadors in Panama, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, highlighted the ‘remarkable results achieved’ and underlined that ‘Thanks to the contribution made by the project, Social innovation issues are now at the top of the Partner Countries' public agenda and public policies and there is an increased number of local private and public funds aimed at promoting social innovation and financing social innovation ventures.’ \(C5\) 

 <ins>Southeast Asia</ins> 

 A follow\-up project, also led by GCU, was launched in Southeast Asia in 2016 with partners in Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand. With funding of EUR999,445, the Southeast Asian Social Innovation Network \( [http://www.seasin\-eu.org/](http://www.seasin-eu.org/)\) established SISUs which are currently incubating and supporting 74 new social innovation projects and enterprises \(C6\). The impact of the project in the region has been endorsed by the British Council which states ‘The SEASIN project led by GCU has strengthened the fledgling social innovation eco\-system within universities in Southeast Asia. It has done this by offering new approaches and models to developing organisations and initiatives \(including social enterprises\) that are addressing social needs that are currently unmet by either the public or private sector.’ \(C7\) 

 Social innovations and enterprises supported by the SISUs include: 

-  Cambodia: Color Silk Enterprise Cambodia; Tree Alliance 

-  Malaysia: The Good Tavern Social Market; Agricultural Transformation Project involving Indigenous People in Lojing Highland, Gua Musang, Kelantan; Human Library Malaysia 

-  Myanmar: Career Enhancement Program for Social Enterprises /Entrepreneurs by Myanmar Business Executives Association; Recycle Myanmar 

-  Thailand: Local Alike, a Travel Social Enterprise; GLab; The Guidelight 

 The SISUs continue to be operational as supported by testimonials: for example, the Dean of the International College at the National University of Management, Phnom Penh states “In terms of sustainability, our university's Social Innovation Lab is now fully sustainable… and we continue to run design thinking workshops and design challenges for both our students and also social sector organizations ....all of this would not have been possible without the support from Glasgow Caledonian University.” \(C8\) 

 <ins>Europe</ins> 

 Further initiatives \- including Social Innovation through Knowledge Exchange \(SIKE \-  [https://sike\-eu.org/](https://sike-eu.org/) \(976,575 Euros funding\)\), which was showcased at the 8th European University Business Forum \( [https://ec.europa.eu/education/events/8th\-university\-business\-forum\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/education/events/8th-university-business-forum_en)\), have focussed on applying the same conceptual approach within Europe. This has led to the establishment of SISUs supporting 75 new projects in Scotland, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Croatia, and has culminated in GCU being endorsed by Scottish Government as the UK’s National Social Innovation Competence Centre. \(C9\)

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Sensing Place \(SP\) is an ongoing suite of work of multimodal, participatory projects with positive impacts on participants’ sense of personal well\-being and community building.  It seeks to counter the stigma and devaluing of spaces ‘left behind’ by Industrialisation and negative stereotypes of the North. More recently, SP provided recommendations for a local business, to aid its ability to maintain communities of older clients online over lockdown.  SP has produced impacts on communities’ abilities to express and explore ‘belonging’ and to see space ‘anew’. This has bolstered well\-being, brought communities together and re\-affirmed the value of participants’ everyday experiences.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Taylor and Tew Thompson work at the intersections of non\-representational theories, interdisciplinary ‘turns’ to spatiality and affect, and participatory mobile methodologies. Their aim is to explore and counter the negative impact of deindustrialisation and urban change on people’s everyday lives. This case study explores affective connections to place. This is the first stage of a wider unfolding portfolio of work on space and place that has as its goal the creation of intersectional policy change to make places fit for liveable lives.  This first stage seeks to impact on ordinary and the everyday disconnections and reconnections with spaces. 

 Taylor’s  work develops original and significant responses to spatial, architectural and social change, and develops interdisciplinary, creative approaches to the real\-life problems of post\-industrial areas where communities are eroded or divided. *Being* and *belonging* are key aspects of her work.  This has prompted \(i\) her co\-founding of the Commoners’ Choir with Boff Whalley \(ex\-member of Chumbawamba\) **\(3.2\)** \(ii\) her focus on community belonging online **\(3.3\)** and in the ruins of deindustrialisation **\(3.1\)** and \(iii\) her new insights into the expression of ‘taste’ to home\-making \( **3.5\)**.  Her work offers robust criticism of nostalgia, to develop sensuous, mobile ethnographic encounters with peoples’ memories of the shift from an industrial to a post\-industrial village \( **3.1\)**. 

 Tew Thompson’s originality rests in her elucidation of the connections between two cultural theorists, Benjamin and Baudrillard to argue to methodological contribution with the idea of the ‘surface ethnography’ **\(3.6\)**. This work underpinned explorations of urban transformation and cultivation through embodied/sensory practices of place\-making through significant contributions to ‘walk and talk’ methods: **Urban Constellating’ \(February 2015\)** took place in Leeds city centre and ended with a ‘making workshop’, where 20 participants shared experiences from the walk and created their own city snow globe.  A free ‘zine of participants’ photographs and essays was circulated across the city. The **‘You Are Here: Leaving the City’ Walk \(July 2015\)** was a 16\-mile night walk. 25 Participants experienced darkness advancing and receding to understand the interrelationship of city to countryside and consider the relationship between our internal landscapes and the external landscape.  Recognising that engagements with space evoke memories, her empirical research \( **3.4**\) has examined regional TV, to argue that *Last of the Summer Wine* is a living memory for the local people and a broader imaginary. This original argument makes a significant contribution to understanding of the role of ordinary television in cultural memory through ethnographic work.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 SP has had positive impacts on participants’ understanding of their own localities, and consequently, well\-being and sense of belonging. This is the first stage of a wider portfolio of work that seeks to inform policy change to make places fit for liveable lives.  This first stage seeks to impact on ordinary, everyday disconnections and reconnections with spaces. 

 **Commoners Choir: reconnecting politics to space** 

 Concern with community \(3.1\), Northern identity \(3.5\) and space, fuelled Taylor’s desire to make a creative, change for local people. Collaborating with Chumbawamba’s  Boff Whalley, Taylor founded the Commoner’s Choir \(3.2\). Participants reported experiencing enhanced wellbeing: ‘I’m not arty at all, I’m an accountant, yet suddenly I was performing with people from very different walks of life’ \(5.4\) : ‘the choir is a community to which everyone contributes, whether its printing badges, writing song lyrics’ \(5.1\); ‘the shared act of singing in harmony…is very bonding’ \( **5.4**\). A sense of community helped participants to regard themselves as activists: *‘*Joining \[Commoners’ Choir\] was life changing. For the first time in my life… it made me realise I could protest about access to green space’ \( **5.1**\). Examples of this activism include \(i\) celebrating the Mass Trespass of Kinder Scout and \(ii\) commemorations of the Magna Carta. Both highlighted the enduring barriers to access for ordinary people to much of the British landscape.  **‘**when we sang at the top of Kinder Scout it gave me this indescribable feeling in my belly that singing about things that really matter produces.’ **\(5.1\).**  Extensive media attention in addition to local word of mouth on the benefits of the choir, have grown the membership from 28 in 2015 to 74 today. 

 **Landscapes: Reconnecting to the past \(3.1\) and to the North \(3.5\)** 

 Taylor’s ongoing research explores residents’ responses to a landscape altered by the demolition of a carpet factory that was a village’s main employer. With residents, she co\-produced an exhibition of ex\-workers’ photographs and artefacts.  Participants noted how significant it was for them to have their working past valued. ‘the project helped me feel more important about my working life, which up to now had seemed pointless.’ \( **5.5**\).  Giving people a voice with a future view to provide recommendations to policy makers was a valued aspect of this work: participants noted: ‘we should be included in the planning decisions about what happens to old works villages in the future. The clock, some of the looms could be made into monuments to remind folk that we made fantastic carpets. Policy\-makers should read your work and act with it in mind\!’ \( **5.5**\). This criticality was evident too in Taylor’s work on owners of Hockney’s work; participants testified to greater understanding about why Hockney’s landscapes mattered as a counter\-force to stigma of the North \( **5.2**\). 

 **Keeping communities through Covid \(3.3\)** 

 Exercise and social interactions are important to older citizens and both were threatened by Covid. Taylor with Raisborough and Harrison, used their expertise to evaluate an exercise business’s transition to online classes for older clientele in the first lock down. The work produced a list of recommendations on pricing, and ways to sustain older people’s sense of belonging with the business and other class members in the uncertain times of Covid. The business owner embraced the recommendations. The owner said: ‘I learned they wanted the choice to use both studio and Zoom pilates and it gave me the confidence to make the key business decision to fully invest in both.’ \( **5.6**\) The report enabled her to glean a tighter sense of the ontological security home held for her clients and gave her a ‘more 3D sense of the circumstances of their physical and mental lives during pandemic.’ **\(5.6\)** 

 **Seeing the places anew: reconnecting to present \(3.4 and 3.6\)** 

 Tew Thompson work \(3.4, 3.6\) argues that experiential and sensory elements of walking can have positive psychological benefits.   Testimonial evidence affirms this. Participants’ in her walking tours in and out of the city testified to the wellbeing benefits of taking part \(’the walk did me so much good for such a long time’\) and the positive health effects of night walks \(‘the stress of work just melted away throughout the walk’\) \( **5.4**\).  It also invited participants to see their city afresh:  ‘It didn’t occur to me that that would be something of interest, so it elevated something that was quite everyday to me’ \( **5.3**\). 

 Overall, the projects have led to an enhanced sense of community for its participants.

# 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Professor Campling’s research on the global value chains in tuna, international fisheries trade and development, and his ongoing policy work with international agencies, provided the bases for: 

-  contributing to the official thinking and positions of six Pacific Island members of the World Trade Organisation \(WTO\) in the negotiations of prohibitions on fisheries subsidies, as reflected in formal textual submissions and a draft WTO agreement 

-  successfully advising the Pacific Islands Forum \(14 countries\) to not enter into a trade arrangement with the US, saving financial resources and personnel time 

-  successfully recommending more development\-friendly ‘rules or origin’ for local fish processing to the East African Community in its trade agreement with the EU 

-  informing the decision by the United Nations General Assembly to grant an extended transition to the Solomon Islands in its graduation from Least Developed Country status, preserving \~1,800 fish processing jobs. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Campling’s research since 2004 on the articulations of international fisheries trade, global value chains \(GVCs\) in tuna and the political economy of small island developing states \(SIDS\) have drawn on interviews with almost 1,000 people in 20 countries. His theoretically\-informed, but empirically\-driven research has fed into policy making to improve fisheries trade for development at national, regional and international scales. 

#  Advancing political economy analysis of marine capture fisheries 

 Campling’s research has intervened critically into siloed, technicist scholarship on fisheries and brought the field into conversation with debates in development studies \[3.6; 3.7\] and economic geography \[3.4; 3.5; 3.8; 3.9\]. This includes a long\-standing collaboration with Elizabeth Havice \(University of North Carolina\-Chapel Hill\). The main findings include: 

1.  Historicizing fisheries trade and development patterns and relations to understand the potential for developing countries to negotiate change to contemporary trade rules in bilateral and multilateral economic relations \[3.1; 3.2; 3.3\]. 

1.  Mapping and identifying principal drivers in fisheries GVCs that were otherwise ‘hidden’, including how nature shapes GVCs based on natural resources and vice versa \[3.8\] and how environmental governance is used by dominant firms as a business strategy to capture value from, and pass on risks and costs to, other firms \[3.4\]. 

1.  Theorising property relations over mobile living resources, and how state control over resource access can be leveraged for development outcomes \[3.5; 3.6; 3.9\]. 

 Campling’s academic research and policy work have developed iteratively. His expertise is world\-leading as evidenced in invited contributions for policy advice and commissioned research by international agencies.

#  Understanding how the international trade regime and the private governance of global value chains \(GVCs\) in tuna articulate and contribute to unequal outcomes for countries and firms 

 The global tuna industry is worth an estimated annual USD42,000,000,000 in sales. In a stream of work on EU\-Africa, Caribbean and Pacific group \(ACP\) relations, Campling has shown that current rules of origin associated with EU trade preferences for tuna products are designed to benefit French and Spanish fishing interests. However, at the same time these preferences were a central component in one of the very few success stories of industrial upgrading in 40 years of EU\-ACP trade relations \[3.1; 3.3; 3.5\]. He has shown that to improve economies of scale and investment\-potential in ACP\-based processing, more flexible EU rules of origin are needed, but negotiations must contend with mercantilist interests in the EU. Further, preferences are a necessary but not sufficient component in this upgrading process \(see below\). 

 A second steam of research is on multilateral negotiations at the World Trade Organisation \(WTO\). Here Campling showed the tensions inherent in the much feted ‘triple win’ rhetoric of WTO negotiations since 2001 on proposed rules to end fisheries subsidies. Instead, Campling argued that negotiators should start by teasing out the commercial interests at stake among the various ad hoc negotiation blocs and how each use, in different ways ‘sustainability’ discourse to advance these interests \[3.2\]. 

#  Understanding how small island developing states \(SIDS\) can leverage their sovereign rights over fisheries resources to enhance trade and development 

 Many SIDS are dependent on fisheries\-based revenue and employment, but the odds are against these politically\-marginal, fiscally\-weak polities that suffer from diseconomies of scale. Campling’s research has shown the actual and potential policy mechanisms available to SIDS in leveraging improved socio\-economic development outcomes from their articulations with tuna GVCs and trade regimes. This includes the use of sovereign rights under the Law of the Sea to capture revenue \[3.6; 3.9\] and/or to encourage onshore investment \[3.5\]. He has shown that trade preferences and sovereign rights are necessary but not sufficient developmental tools, and the interplay of broader ecological, regulatory and commercial factors need to be understood in understanding SIDS policy articulations with tuna GVCs \[3.1; 3.4; 3.7\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

#  Institutionalising more development\-friendly rules of origin in the East African Community\-EU Economic Partnership Agreement \(EPA\) 

 Based upon his research demonstrating that European Union \(EU\) trade preferences need more flexible rules of origin to benefit local fisheries industry \[3.1, 3.3\] and his analysis of the structure of the Western Indian Ocean fishing industry \[3.7\], Campling advised the East African Community \(EAC\) in 2012 to push for more ‘development\-friendly’ rules of origin in trade negotiations with the European Union \(EU\). As the EAC’s Director General, Trade and Customs put it, EAC negotiators used this research successfully to justify a position ‘that more than doubled the prior derogation decision’ \[5.1\] in its EPA with the EU \[5.2\], which was signed in October 2014 and authorised by the EU in June 2016 and provisionally applied. 

#  Pacific Island leaders decided not to enter into negotiations with the US on a new trade and investment arrangement 

 Drawing on his single\-authored and joint research on fisheries trade policy and its articulations with tuna global value chains \(GVCs\) \[3.1, 3.2, 3.5\], Campling was a named author on a 2014 report \(led by Elizabeth Havice\) that recommended against the 15 Pacific Island countries \(PICs\) entering into negotiations for a trade and investment arrangement with the US. The report found that US trade preferences would not offset high PIC cost structures for tuna processing because of the combination of existing global competition and low\-profit US retail markets. As fish products are among the very few PIC exports that might benefit from preferential goods trade with the US, the report advised that a deal offered limited gains. This was not the anticipated outcome, but the research persuaded leading figures in the region such as the Director General of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency who, at a meeting of senior PIC officials in July 2015, ‘urged the meeting to weigh the reality and practicality of PICs ability to access US markets and to determine the feasibility of pursuing such an arrangement’ \[5.3\].  The final PIC decision to not enter into negotiations with the US saved considerable financial and personnel resources for very small, fiscally\-squeezed states \[5.6\]. 

#  Influencing World Trade Organisation fisheries subsidies negotiations, especially Pacific Island positions 

 Global commitment to reach agreement on fisheries subsidies rules at the WTO by 2020 was re\-affirmed in 2015 by Heads of State in UN Sustainable Development Goal 14.6. Campling’s research on the political economy of WTO fisheries subsidies negotiations \[3.2\] and international fisheries trade and GVCs more generally \[3.1; 3.4\], feeds into his impact on the oral and text\-based positions and thinking of Pacific Island and other WTO members in these negotiations **.** There are \(a\) public\-facing and \(b\) confidential dimensions to Campling’s impacts on this negotiation process. 

 \(a\) The public\-facing dimension uses Campling’s research to develop independent policy briefs \(with Havice\) for  [UNCTAD](http://unctad.org/en/pages/PublicationWebflyer.aspx?publicationid=1662) \(2016\) and  [Commonwealth Secretariat](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/c295c5f3-en.pdf?expires=1505914459&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=750C7C978CC2EE7A3EDF6A4A974CB0EB) \(2017\) on the developmental implications of proposed WTO rules, which were presented by Campling in high\-level policy seminars at the WTO \(4 October 2016\) and the Commonwealth Small States Office, Geneva \(23 March 2017\). This work translated abstract proposed trade rules into implications for real\-world fisheries development \[5.4; 5.7\] and recommended an approach to negotiating Special & Differential Treatment \(S&DT\) that simultaneously provides developing Members with low levels of fisheries capacity the policy space to develop their fisheries into the future, while disciplining the most harmful subsidies and subsidising Members \(which include larger developing Members\). The recommendation seeks to bypass the ‘differentiation problem’ between divergent developing countries by focusing on the volume of catch \(i.e., SDT based on a ‘de minimis’ provision\) rather than self\-declared Developing Country status at the WTO. This developing country ‘small fishing nation’ exemption appeared in a formal submission to the WTO by the African, Caribbean and Pacific group \(ACP\) in February 2020, was picked up in a subsequent formal submission by India in March, and mirrored in the Draft Consolidated Text produced by the Chair of the WTO Negotiating Group on Rules in June 2020, which formed the basis for negotiations from September 2020 \[5.7; 5.10\]. 

 \(b\) The confidential dimension is funded by the UK’s Department for International Development \(DfID, \(now FCDO\)\) since July 2018 and involves working with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat \(PIFS\) Geneva Office that represents six Pacific Island WTO Members \(‘the Pacific Group’\). Campling is directly informing the negotiation positions and thinking, and textual proposals of these countries in their relations with their allies – the ACP – and in bilateral and multilateral settings in Geneva and online. Impacts include: 

-  Additions and revisions to official ACP room documents submitted to the WTO membership. These included proposed text in February 2020 that seeks to preserve the policy space made available to coastal states by virtue of their sovereign rights over marine resources \[3.6; 3.9\], in part through the charging of access fees and variable licencing arrangements for domestic vessels. Campling’s research has also informed a Pacific Group submission to WTO Heads of Delegation in July 2020 which elaborates conceptually on access fees and domestic vessel licensing. These were successfully introduced as \(i\) unbracketed text on access agreements in the third draft of the Chair’s negotiating text in December 2020, \(ii\) mention of variable licencing arrangements as a topic for ongoing negotiation in 2021 in the Chair’s explanatory text to all Members in December 2020 \[5.8\]; and \(iii\) the developing country ‘small fishing nation’ SDT noted above \[5.10\]. 

-  Capacity building of the Pacific Group in relation to the implications of proposed WTO rules on the diverse fishing interests from artisanal to industrial scale, and the threats and prospects for Pacific Group in particular. As Permanent Representative & Ambassador Falemaka, Permanent Delegation of the Pacific Islands Forum in Geneva put it, Campling’s ‘depth and breadth of knowledge and expertise on fisheries economics and global fisheries development … has greatly assisted the Pacific negotiating team, who are essentially trade experts, in Geneva and in capitals, to better understand the interface between trade rules and the fisheries sector. This has helped to sharpen the focus of our negotiations on key elements and outcomes that are beneficial to the Pacific’ \[5.4\]. 

-  Capacity building of the Pacific Group to act as a distinct entity, especially in enhancing its engagement in bilateral meetings with leading WTO members in January, May, and November 2019, and February and March 2020 negotiation clusters, and online during the Covid\-19 pandemic \[5.4; 5.5\]. As Ambassador Falemaka explains this heighted ‘sensitisation \[of\] the WTO membership to Pacific\-specific concerns, especially as they relate to threats to our fisheries management systems and development policy space, access agreements and government revenue, and the role of variable fishing licences in underpinning our domestic fisheries development both now and into the future’ \[5.4\]. 

-  Enhancing national level engagement with the negotiations, especially among national delegates from capitals in Fiji and Papua New Guinea, and their subsequent taking of concrete national positions on a negotiation issue \[5.4; 5.5\] 

-  Drawing on his recommendations \[5.6\], FFA submitted a statement to the annual Pacific Islands fisheries ministers meeting in 2019. This set out the policy objective of achieving a balance between supporting a global reduction in fisheries subsidies for environmental and economic reasons with that of ensuring ‘that any outcome should not unnecessarily constrain the ability of SIDS \[small island developing states\] to develop their tuna fisheries and that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for SIDS should be an integral part of these negotiations’ \[5.9\]. 

#  Extending Solomon Islands’ graduation from Least Developed Country status 

 Campling’s research \[3.1, 3.4, 3.5\] underpinned a 2018  [Commonwealth Secretariat investigation](https://www.ffa.int/node/2090) of the socio\-economic impacts on the Solomon Islands of its graduation from Least Developed Country \(LDC\) status. This informed the Solomon Islands’ government request and recommendation by the UN Committee for Development Policy \(CDP\) to offer an extended transition period \[5.7\]. Tuna exports from the Solomon Islands depend upon duty\-free access to the EU market under its ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative \(EBA\) for LDCs. The investigation made clear that the trade effect of the removal of LDC status would result in the cessation of onshore tuna processing. The United Nations General Assembly agreed to the CDP recommendation and granted ‘on an *exceptional* basis \[…\] an additional preparatory period of three years \[to 2024\] before the start of the three\-year preparatory period leading to graduation’ \( [Resolution 73/133, 13 December 2018](https://undocs.org/pdf?symbol=en/A/RES/73/133)\). The earliest possible year for graduation was 2021, which means that \~1,800 fish processing jobs are more likely to remain secure for an additional six years, buying the government time to pursue alternative EU market access arrangements. In addition, Head of Section, International Trade Policy, Commonwealth Secretariat noted that this ‘study had a major impact with the Secretariat as well as with the other development partners \(United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and the Small Island Developing States \(OHRLLS\)\) and donors \(Australia\).’ \[5.7\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Mauritius has the world’s 2<sup>nd</sup> highest Diabetes fatality rate. Lewis’s expertise in the early identification of Peripheral Arterial Disease \(PAD\) and experience establishing UK screening led to her appointment to establish Diabetic foot screening within a Mauritian national screening programme. As a result, 78 Nurses covering 149 centres have been trained, conducting 239,888 screenings between 2016 and 2019. Actions taken as a direct result of these PAD screenings will save at least 2,144 lives by 2029 and the success of the Mauritius screenings has led to requests for a similar programme from the government of Trinidad **.** 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Background 

 As an experienced clinician by 2002, Lewis had concerns over the lack of systematic early intervention programmes for Peripheral Arterial Disease \(PAD\). These concerns led to her embarking on a PhD at Cardiff University under the supervision of Prof. David Owens, then Director of the Diabetes Research Network for Wales, Consultant Diabetologist and Clinical Lead for Diabetes at Cardiff & Vale University Health Board.  Her novel PhD research showed that Pulse Volume Waveform \(PVW\) profiles were more effective in identifying PAD than the standard method for measuring peripheral lower limb blood flow – known as ‘manual ankle\-brachial pressure’ \(ABI\). ABI has known limitations in detecting lower limb arterial diseases, partly because Diabetes can cause arterial stiffening. As a direct result of Lewis’ PhD findings, Huntleigh Diagnostics developed a PVW capability for their ‘Dopplex Ability’ Automatic Ankle Brachial Index System machine, which was launched in \(2010\)**Footnote:**

 This device has since been sold in 66 countries, generating £8,675,000. A letter from Huntleigh is available to confirm Lewis’ influence on its design development but is not included in this submission because both Lewis’ PhD and the Dopplex launch predate her employment with Cardiff Metropolitan University. Details included here for contextual information only. 
. 

 Research at Cardiff Metropolitan University 

 On joining Cardiff Met, Lewis continued her research into developing efficient, low cost and accurate PAD screening, the findings of which underpinned the Diabetic foot screening programme in Mauritius. For example, it involved validating PVW’s accuracy, testing efficiency concepts in foot screening to save time and money and developing further insights into the connections between rapid expert assessment of lower\-limb ulcer episodes and healing. 

 As part of this programme of research, between 2014 and 2017, Lewis established the accuracy of the low cost, easy\-to\-use PVW method, testing it on 189 patients against the datum of the current ‘gold standard’ test \- an expensive, non\-portable ultrasound duplex scanner operated by a highly trained Medical Physicist. The Dopplex Ability in PVW mode gave 97% similar results \[R1\]. A further study of 326 patients examined the feasibility of reducing costs and improving screening through increased efficiency by conducting Diabetes foot screening as part of an existing national Diabetes Retinopathy Screening programme. This study used the Dopplex Ability’s now clinically proven PVW function to automate PAD measurement. A non\-technical healthcare worker conducted 3\-5\-minute tests during an existing 20\-minute pupil dilation break in the screening required for retinal photographs to be taken. Previously undiagnosed PAD was found in 26.4% of patients. Following the trial 100 patients were contacted at random and asked about the experience. All supported the approach becoming standard practice \[R2\]. Lewis was also part of a team behind the National Diabetes Foot Care Audit \(NDFA\) that collected details of over 33,000 ulcer episodes in over 27,000 people in England and Wales between 2015 and 2018. The team confirmed the critical need for early diagnosis, and found ulcers referred for assessment within 14 days were significantly less severe and likely to heal within 12 weeks \[R3\]. 

 Why Mauritius? 

 The use of Lewis’s research expertise in Mauritius came via her PhD supervisor, Prof. Owens. In 2006 Owens was invited to advise the country on how to develop a proactive scheme to deal with Mauritius’s Diabetes problem through retinopathy screening. Owens eventually realised that a wider\-ranging programme was needed, so in 2013\-14 he formed a foot screening team of seven. Lewis’s PAD expertise led to her appointment as head of the PAD screening development programme \[E1\] and the impacts described here. It also contributed to a UK Royal College of Physicians Excellence in Patient Care International Award in 2018 \[E2\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 ""Over the last five years, a huge leap has been made in terms of structuring the diabetic foot care clinics across Mauritius” \- Head of Diabetic and Vascular Health Centre, Mauritius \[E4\]. 

 Mauritius, a low to middle income country, is  [world number 2 for Diabetes\-related deaths](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/mauritius-diabetes-mellitus)**Footnote:**

 Note that this data is subject to change. Accurate at time of writing – 25/11/20 
. The nation’s intake of both sugar and alcohol is high, which goes some way to explaining why, according to the World Health Rankings, 26% of all deaths in Mauritius are linked to Diabetes Mellitus. In part this is because, prior to 2014, Mauritius had no proactive, structured Diabetes screening programme. 

 Low levels of intensive care services further heightened the need for a structured and formal screening programme to reduce the burden on existing services: The UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division  [estimates Mauritius’ population at 1,271,767](https://population.un.org/wpp/), yet at the time of writing, there is only one Podiatrist, one Vascular Surgeon and one Orthotist to serve the entire island. Lowering the number of patients needing the services of these professions is therefore a critical step to improving survival rates from Diabetes Mellitus. 

 Lewis established Mauritius’s first systematic Diabetic foot screening programme in 2014 \[E3\]. In doing so she drew on her experience of developing screening in the UK. For example, she is part of a comprehensive partnership including Welsh Government and Public Health Wales to pilot ‘One Stop Shop’ diabetes screening programme for the 196,000 people with Diabetes registered in Wales – an evolution of her feasibility study into combining PAD and retinopathy screening \[R2\]. 

 In Mauritius, Lewis trained 18 nurses as fully qualified Diabetic Footcare Officers \(DFCOs\), dealing in ulcer management, foot screening and the use of PVW to test for PAD \- one of the key signs of advancing Diabetes. These 18 DFCOs consequently established foot screening clinics in all 6 of Mauritius’s hospitals, training a further 60 Diabetes Specialist Nurses to serve 149 centres throughout Mauritius in the foot care of Diabetic patients \[E4\]. Further, all new trainee doctors and nurses also received intensive training by the DFCOs.  This relationship between the DFCOs and medics has had a sizeable effect, with the referral rate of patients to specialist Diabetic Footcare Units rising 57% from 3,263 in 2016 to 5,650 in 2018. The collective effect of this activity has been marked. Between 2016 and 2019, Mauritius moved from having **no** systematic Diabetic foot screening, to screening 239,888 people previously diagnosed with Diabetes, marking a critical breakthrough in dealing with a serious national health problem. Lewis’s foot screening programme is therefore an essential step in improving the survival rates of people with Diabetes in Mauritius because it allows early detection of PAD before ulceration. 

 Mauritius’s 26% Diabetes fatality rate means that in the normal course of events, at least 62,300 of these 239,888 people would have developed the fatally serious lower limb circulatory diseases associated with the advanced stages of Diabetes. One of the first signs of these diseases are Diabetic Foot Ulcers \(DFUs\). Between 2016 and 2019 5,611 Mauritians had DFUs, but no previous diagnosis of Diabetes\-related foot disease. Of these, 3,046 were healed thanks to early detection \(\[E5\], \[E6\], \[E7\], \[E8\]\). Ulcers that progress too far to be healed are the first point of a sequence of events that lead to limb amputations and death. In 2015,  [a systematic review of studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/iwj.12404) found that 40% of patients with DFUs had died after 5 years. A  [2012 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447849/) found that 70.4% had died after 10 years [](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447849/). We can therefore construe that between 2016 and 2019, 3,046 Mauritians were saved from the suffering associated with limb loss, that around 1,218 will not die of Diabetes by 2024 and that approximately 2,144 will not die of it by 2029 as the statistics suggest they otherwise would**Footnote:**

 Figures for the whole period would likely demonstrate further impacts but are unavailable. 
. An  [average Mauritian household of 3.5 people](https://population.un.org/Household/index.html)  means that for each of these 3,046 individuals whose ulcers were healed thanks to early detection, a further 2.5 individuals \- 7,615 people \- were saved from the direct consequences of the death of a family member. Since many people with Diabetes are parents and breadwinners, there is an extended but presently unquantifiable impact in terms of poverty prevented. 

 Lastly, Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke are  [Mauritius’ 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> greatest killers](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/mauritius-diabetes-mellitus) at 19.9% and 11.6% respectively**Footnote:**

 Note that this data is subject to change. Accurate at time of writing – 25/11/20 
. PAD is a risk factor for both diseases meaning that an unknown number of Mauritians will also not develop these diseases because of Lewis’ PAD screening. 

 Further reach 

 Following the success of PAD screening programme in Mauritius, Lewis has been asked to lead a PAD screening programme in Trinidad \[E10\] where Diabetes is the second leading cause of death at over  [17% of all deaths](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/trinidad-tobago-diabetes-mellitus), with coronary heart disease and strokes as the number 1 and number 3 causes of death respectively.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Diabetes affects over 450 million people worldwide, of whom \~30 million have Type 1 diabetes and are wholly dependent on insulin replacement therapy. Most other diabetes patients have Type 2 diabetes, and about 25% of these will also require insulin treatment for part of their lives. Ground\-breaking University of Surrey research led to a new understanding of a hepato\-selective long\-acting insulin analogue \(detemir\) which informed the development of a further long\-acting insulin analogue degludec \(sold in 86 countries\), and of a complementary rapid\-acting analogue, Fiasp \(sold in 33 countries\). Substantial benefits have resulted for diabetes patients and for healthcare policy, and considerable commercial impact has occurred through sales of the new insulin analogues \(>£1.6 bn\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Effective management of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin therapy is essential to prevent potentially life\-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis and minimise associated long\-term complications by maintaining close to normal, healthy levels of blood sugar. Poor glycaemic control can lead to early\-onset and increased severity of long\-term complications affecting eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels of diabetes patients. 

 In 2004, Professor David L. Russell\-Jones led a collaboration between The University of Surrey and King’s College London which established that because Novo Nordisk’s insulin analogue detemir \(trade name Levemir®\) bound albumin, it would have relatively less access across the tight endothelium in peripheral tissues and relatively more access across the open sinusoidal lining in the liver **\[3.1\]**. 

 These features restore the physiological gradient of greater insulin exposure to the liver than to peripheral tissues. The result is better glycaemic control in diabetes patients than by traditional insulin replacement therapies which create a different \(‘unphysiological’\) distribution of insulin throughout the body when compared to the natural situation, in which the majority of insulin produced by the pancreas is delivered to the liver, and relatively less reaches peripheral tissues. 

 This new knowledge on the value of liver\-selective insulin analogues prompted a step\-change in insulin research by Novo Nordisk, the major provider of global diabetes pharmaceuticals. 

 In collaboration with Novo Nordisk, Prof Russell\-Jones joined an international consortium of academics and clinicians which went on to research and optimise insulin analogues. Modifying the structure of insulin and the way in which it is carried within the circulation makes it possible to alter both the distribution and the biological effects of the resulting ‘insulin analogues’. Such insulin analogues can be longer acting and can offer better glycaemic control for diabetes patients: \(i\) by providing a continuous low level of insulin in the circulation throughout the day, rather than a peak activity at administration that can compromise glycaemic control; and in so doing, \(ii\) reducing the risk of night\-time variations in blood glucose levels. This crucial collaborative research resulted in the development of the detemir follow\-on, degludec \(Novo Nordisk, trade name Tresiba®\), a long\-acting insulin analogue for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes **\[3.2, 3.3\]**. 

 Whist long\-acting insulin analogues greatly improve chronic glycaemic control over previous insulin treatments; a number of diabetes patients receiving them may still struggle to achieve control of their blood glucose levels around mealtimes. To further improve glycaemic control in these patients, Prof Russell\-Jones led trials that established an enhanced clinical value for Type 1 patients of the rapid\-acting insulin aspart \(Novo Nordisk, trade name Fiasp®\). Fiasp® more closely matches the healthy body’s physiological response to improve glycaemic control after mealtimes by working more quickly in the bloodstream following injection than existing treatments **\[3.4, 3.5\]**. This Surrey led research identified that the combination of the long\-acting degludec \(Tresiba®\) and fast\-acting insulin aspart \(Fiasp®\) improved night\-time glycaemic control, compared with the combination of Fiasp® and the previous conventional treatment of glargine **\[3.2, 3.6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research at the University of Surrey led by Professor David L. Russell\-Jones prompted a new vision for the design of insulin analogue therapies for diabetes patients. By exposing the liver\-selective properties of the long\-acting detemir, his work underpinned the development, clinical testing and approval to market of the improved insulin analogue, degludec. To complement this long\-acting treatment for diabetes, a rapid\-acting analogue, Fiasp®, was also developed and approved. These new insulin products have impacted on national and international healthcare policy and significantly benefitted diabetes patients worldwide **\[5.1\]**. The commercial impact has been considerable. 

###  **1.** **Impact on national and international healthcare policy** 

###  Degludec 

 In the UK, degludec was accepted for use in September 2013 when it was featured in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) Type I diabetes Evidence Summary **\[5.2\]**; Prof Russell\-Jones co\-authored all three clinical studies on which this evidence summary was based **\[3.2, 3.6\]**. On the basis of this evidence summary, degludec was recognised by the NICE diabetes guidelines for the treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, in children, young people and adults, including those with diabetic co\-morbidities such as eye disease **\[5.3\]**. Following UK approval, degludec was then authorised by the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) for the treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in the European Union, in adults and children aged 1\-18 years **\[5.4\]**. The basis of this authorisation included evidence published by Prof Russell\-Jones **\[3.3\]**, such as clinical study NCT01079234. Furthermore, degludec was approved in the USA by the Food & Drug Administration \(FDA\) in 2015 **\[5.5\]**, who also cite NCT01079234 by its other study identification number NN1250\-3770. 

 **Fiasp**® 

 Underpinned by the clinical trials led by Prof Russell\-Jones **\[3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]**, Fiasp® was approved throughout the European Union in January 2017 by the EMA **\[5.6\]**, citing clinical trial NCT01831765 to which Prof Russell\-Jones’ studies contributed **\[3.4, 3.5\]**, in Canada by Health Canada, also in January 2017 **\[5.7\]**, and in the USA in September 2017 by the FDA **\[5.8\]** who cite clinical trial NCT01831765 by its other study identification number NN1218\-3852. 

###  **2.** **Impact on patient quality of life and cost\-effectiveness of healthcare delivery** 

 The long\-acting liver\-selective nature of degludec enables more consistent day\-to\-day blood glucose profiles. Also, it reduces glucose variability during the day compared with conventional neutral protamine Hagedorn \(NPH\) insulin preparations **\[5.9\]**. This mitigates extreme fluctuations in blood glucose, which in turn defers the onset and reduces the severity of the widely experienced long\-term complications of glycaemic dysregulation which affects the eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels of diabetes patients. Furthermore, it helps to prevent blood glucose levels falling too low \(hypoglycaemia\) when patients can feel hungry and eat more, contributing to weight gain with concomitant poorer health outcomes. Despite the advantages of the long\-acting insulin analogues, many diabetes patients receiving them still struggle to achieve control of their blood glucose levels around mealtimes. Prof Russell\-Jones’ research demonstrated that the fast\-acting insulin analogue Fiasp® improves glycaemic control after mealtimes and that combining the long\-acting \(degludec\) and fast\-acting \(Fiasp®\) insulin analogues significantly reduced night\-time episodes of dysregulated glycaemic control **\[3.2, 3.6\]**. This work has significantly benefitted diabetic patients globally and contributed to improved cost\-effectiveness of healthcare delivery for diabetic patients. The cost\-effectiveness of degludec has been analysed using the IMS CORE diabetes model. The model showed that over a lifetime, treatment for Type 1 with degludec is cheaper and more effective than treatment with either glargine or detemir, with a cost per quality\-adjusted life\-year \(QALY\) of £13,220 \(below the commonly used cost\-effectiveness threshold of £20,000/QALY\) **\[5.10\]**. 

###  3. Commercial impact 

 Degludec \(Tresiba®\) and insulin aspart \(Fiasp®\) are truly ground\-breaking products providing not only significant patient benefit but also impressive revenue generation. They are currently marketed globally by Novo Nordisk both as discrete products and in insulin combinations \(Ryzodeg® & Xultophy®\) with a combined sales revenue in 2019 in excess of £1.6bn **\[5.11\]**. 

 \- Tresiba®, insulin degludec \(DKK9259m=£1.1bn\) 

 \- Fiasp®, fast\-acting insulin aspart \(DKK1243m=£151m\) 

 \- Ryzodeg® 70/30, insulin degludec/insulin aspart \(DKK993m=£120m\) 

 \- Xultophy®, insulin degludec/liraglutide \(DKK2210m=£269m\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Ensuring the ‘legacy issues’ faced by families of people serving indeterminate Imprisonment for Public Protection \(IPP\) sentences \(abolished in 2012\) are understood and acted upon has been at the heart of research by Dr Harry Annison at Southampton Law School. Raising awareness of the ongoing issues that remain for the 3,400 IPP prisoners still incarcerated has resulted in: 

-  Putting on the policy agenda the continuing support needs of families of people sentenced to IPP – for politicians, policy\-makers and practitioners in the criminal justice system 

-  Changing policy and practice by national organisations including the Parole Board, HM Prison and Probation Service \(HMPPS\) and Spurgeons children’s charity. 

-  Ensuring that voices of families of people sentenced to IPP are heard, and their needs and lived experiences recognised. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background** 

 The IPP sentence was introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and implemented on 4 April 2005. The introduction of an explicitly risk\-based sentence, ensuring the indeterminate incarceration of ‘dangerous offenders’, was a radical departure from existing practice. Swiftly rising numbers of IPP prisoners not matched by adequate resourcing or the timely development of bespoke systems and processes resulted in many people serving sentences much longer than their tariff \(the period the offence was ‘worth’\), with often tragic consequences: rates of self\-harm are nearly three times higher than for prisoners serving life and determinate sentences. Over 8,000 IPP sentences were imposed in total. 

 The IPP sentence was repealed in 2012 but only prospectively; the decision not to make the abolition retrospective, or to take some other form of action, caused considerable upset for families \[ **3.1**\]. Annison’s monograph *Dangerous Politics* made clear the exclusionary dynamics at the heart of the creation, amendment and abolition of the IPP sentence, with families not being consulted and indeed a wide range of relevant groups being largely ignored \[ **3.2**\]. 

 Approximately 3,400 IPP prisoners currently remain incarcerated, of whom 2,000 have never been released and a further 1,400 have been recalled to prison. Official statistics show that the recall rate for released IPPs continues to grow, indicating that the issues caused by IPP are far from resolved. This poses significant challenges for the criminal justice system: indeterminate\-sentenced prisoners are resource\-intensive; hopeless prisoners pose significant challenges for prison management; and more fundamentally it risks undermining the legitimacy of the system \[ **3.3**\]. 

 **Research Findings and Activities** 

 Annison led a research project ‘Exploring the Secondary Pains of Indeterminate Imprisonment: The case of IPP families’ in 2017\-18 with Professor Rachel Condry \(University of Oxford\). Drawing on survey \(199 responses\) and in\-depth interviews with affected families \(15\), this research for the first time provided a detailed and theoretically\-informed understanding of families’ experiences of the ongoing dynamics of the IPP sentence \[ **3.1**, **3.4**\]. 

 The findings made clear the negative material impacts, including the effects on family relationships and health, of the IPP sentence on families. The over\-arching thematic issues identified were an ongoing sense of injustice for the families, uncertainty, hope and hopelessness. It found that families were forced to exist in a liminal state of *near*\-hopelessness, and that release from prison for their relative brought little relief due to the constant fear of recall. The research thus identified the ways in which criminal justice organisations’ policies and practices, within the specific context of the IPP sentence, were causing significant harm. 

 This research – disseminated via electronic and physical publication, presentations to the Parole Board, HMPPS and Prison Reform Trust \(PRT\), and a parliamentary Policy Briefing Launch on 17 October 2018 – led directly to commitments by the Parole Board, HMPPS and National Probation Service better to understand the experiences of IPP families, and to explore the development of appropriate information and guidance materials in response to this. 

 Dr Annison secured funding to enable a collaborative project entitled ‘The Contribution of Families to the Resettlement of People Serving IPPs’ \[ **G.1**\]. The project addressed the pains of IPP families and also the increasing number of recalled IPP prisoners. The project utilised a co\-production method that involved families of IPP prisoners as collaborators in order to identify specific issues and potential solutions. This was informed by Annison’s argument, based on his empirical analysis of elite policy making \[ **3.2**\], that mechanisms are required by which policy participants are better able to learn from people with a range of perspectives and in particular to learn from those with lived experience of penal policy \[ **3.5**\]. 

 The resulting report ‘A Helping Hand’ \[ **3.6**\] set out detailed findings and recommendations in relation to the prison service, probation service, Parole Board, HMPPS psychology, and voluntary sector organisations that support prisoners and their families. These included the need for: legislative change to address the ‘left behind’ IPP prisoners; policy and practice changes by organisations in order better to recognise and support families of IPP\-sentenced prisoners; sufficiently detailed and clear information and communication with families; and training and guidance for relevant staff in alignment with those other recommendations.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1 Putting on the policy agenda the continuing support needs of families of people sentenced to IPP** 

 The project and related activities resulted in substantially raised awareness and understanding of the issues facing families of indeterminate\-sentenced IPP prisoners by key stakeholders including the Ministry of Justice, the Parole Board for England and Wales, HM Prisons and Probation Service and voluntary sector organisations. The Head of Policy at PRT considered that the issue “ *had previously been substantially neglected by policy\-makers since the prospective repeal of the IPP sentence in 2012*” \[ **5.1**\]. 

 A parliamentary launch event in October 2018 for \[ **3.1**\] was sponsored by Jo Stevens MP, with Robert Neill MP \(Chair, Justice Committee\) and Martin Jones \(Chief Executive, Parole Board\) responding to the report. It was attended by senior representatives of HMPPS, the Parole Board and other relevant organisations. Martin Jones stated that “ *the evidence\-based research had provided key insights which were of great interest to the Parole Board*” \[ **5.2**\]. Dr Annison’s research, in the view of PRT, “ *put the issue of families of people serving IPPs firmly on the agenda*” \[ **5.1**\]. Government support was indicated by Robert Buckland QC MP’s statement \(then Minister of State, Ministry of Justice\) to the House of Commons in June 2019 that, “ *We are very much aware of the work of Professor Harry Annison, who works in partnership with the Prison Reform Trust and has already given us an important insight into the impact on families of their loved ones serving IPP sentences. I am looking forward to seeing the conclusions of the next stage of his work, which is currently being supported by IPP and family leads from Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service*.” \[ **5.3**\] 

 As part of the PRT collaborative project that resulted in ‘A Helping Hand’ \[ **3.6**\], a Stakeholder Roundtable was held in April 2019 to discuss preliminary findings and recommendations. This was attended by senior representatives of HMPPS, National Probation Service, Parole Board, POPS \(‘Partners of Prisoners’, national family charity\) and chaired by the PRT. This enabled a better understanding of existing developments in related areas such as the emerging roll\-out of the Families Agenda in criminal justice, as well as understanding the constraints faced by organizations as well as opportunities to achieve our emerging draft recommendations. The subsequent policy report ‘A Helping Hand’, was published with the Prison Reform Trust and “ *was welcomed across the criminal justice system. A launch event on 6<sup>th</sup> November 2019 in Winchester was well\-attended and clearly demonstrated the support and interest of a range of practitioners in the sector*.” \[ **5.1**\] 

 While HMPPS did develop a Families Strategy from 2017, this activity “ *did not cover any unique aspects of the experience of families of those serving IPP sentences*.” Dr Annison’s work “ *provided compelling evidence that really got the families’ voices heard by both staff and politicians*” \[ **5.4**\]. 

 Wider awareness of the issues facing families of people serving IPP has also been achieved by the publication of supporting pieces in the prison newspaper *Inside Time*, the Probation Quarterly practitioner journal, the influential Russell Webster criminal justice blog; the HMPPS ‘Insights’ blog and voluntary sector body Clinks. The ‘A Helping Hand’ report was also featured exclusively in *The Guardian* by Home Affairs Correspondent Jamie Grierson \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **4.2 Changing policy and practice by \(and in collaboration with\) national organisations including the Parole Board, HM Prison and Probation Service \(HMPPS\) and Spurgeons children’s charity** 

 As regards the Parole Board, “ *When Dr Annison first contacted \[us\], there was very little specific resource for families of prisoners in the parole system, either in terms of information available for families or to have their voice heard*.” \[ **5.2**\] The research and subsequent ‘A Helping Hand’ report “ *presented a very compelling rationale which directly informed the Board’s decision to establish a specific policy workstream on families of prisoners*” \[ **5.2**\]. 

 For HMPPS, the research and ‘A Helping Hand’ report was “ *particularly helpful in informing our policy and practice in relation to how we support IPP prisoners and their families, with some added benefits to the broader group of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences*.” \[ **5.4**\] One key output emerging as a result of Dr Annison’s work was the development of publications targeted at families. These were identified as one key means to achieve some of the recommendations of ‘A Helping Hand’. Those developed collaboratively with Dr Annison include: 

-  ‘Offering a Helping Hand: Resources and guidance for families and others supporting people serving IPP’ booklet, published by Spurgeons children’s charity in July 2020 \[ **5.6**\] 

-  ‘Information for Families or Friends of Prisoners Having a Parole Review’, published by Parole Board for England and Wales in August 2020. This includes sections targeted specifically at indeterminate\-sentenced prisoners. \[ **5.7**\] 

-  ‘A guide for the families & significant others of those serving Indeterminate Sentences in prisons’, was intended for publication by HM Prison and Probation Service in November 2020, but has been delayed “ *due to the impact of the pandemic*” and now “ *will be published by HMPPS, following COVID\-19 related delays, in January 2021*” \[ **5.4**\] 

 All publications have been distributed online and in hard copy to key stakeholders, including being distributed to all prisons and relevant personnel. Prior to these publications, “ *there has been very little guidance tailored to families and free of jargon, and families often don’t understand the process and don’t know what’s going on. This is a major step forward that has pulled directly from Dr Annison’s work with families of IPP prisoners*.” \[ **5.4**\]. For the Parole Board, “ *The recommendations from Harry and Christina’s research provided a clear message about the gap in information for families and friends about parole, and \[identified\] where something could be developed…that could make quite a difference to a lot of people*” \[ **5.8**\]. The Board’s ‘Information for Families…’ booklet \[ **5.7**\] comes directly “ *off the back of recommendations from research undertaken by experts from Southampton Law School…on the impact of the IPP sentence on families*” \[ **5.7**\]. 

 Annison’s research, and subsequent collaboration, also led to the following activities and publications targeted at relevant practitioners: 

-  The HMPPS staff training course ‘Life and IPP Prisoners’ was updated in 2020, with “ *the insights from ‘A Helping Hand’ report \[used\] to inform the redesign of that training*” \[ **5.4**\]. 

-  A new supplementary information sheet on the experiences of families of people serving IPP was made available to Parole Board members in October 2020, by the Parole Board as part of a wider updating of member guidance. 

-  The Parole Board also published in October 2020 guidance for people sentenced to IPP \(and those supporting them\) on applying to terminate their licence. The need for advice and support in ending the licence period was a key message from our research with families. 

 The HMPPS Head of Indeterminate Sentence Operational Support considered that changes to the HMPPS staff training was “ *particularly important in light of the concern mentioned in the ‘A Helping Hand’ report about lack of awareness of IPP by many staff, particularly in prisons, where staff turnover/movements can be high*.” \[ **5.4**\] Changes include “ *greater emphasis on recognising the sense of injustice that families feel*” about IPP and staff recognising “ *the need to provide clear, simple information to families so that they understand processes and what is happening to their loved ones*” \[ **5.4**\]. 

 The information sheet for Parole Board members provides an “ *aide\-memoire for members as they consider cases of the anxiety that families will be going through*” \[ **5.2**\]. In addition the ‘Offering A Helping Hand’ booklet produced with Spurgeons, though targeted at families, also serves as a useful tool for practitioners and volunteers supporting them. 

 **4.3 Ensuring that voices of families of people sentenced to IPP are heard, and needs and lived experiences recognised** 

 Relevant practitioners – including prison officers and family support workers – attending the launch for ‘A Helping Hand’ \[ **3.5**\] reported gaining a better understanding “ *of the impact of the sentence on families*”, and of “ *the huge information/communication gap which exists*” between criminal justice organisations and families \[ **5.9**\]. Their feedback on planned action included: “ *sharing the research findings*” with staff they manage \(for example “ *distribute to the \[Offender Management Unit\] hub*”\); ensuring that “ *relevant information \[is\] provided in the \[prison\] visitor centre*”; and exploring if “ *families could be involved with sentence planning board*” meetings for IPP prisoners \[ **5.9**\]. These individual efforts are strengthened by HMPPS work in updating its training to “ *directly reference the impact of the IPP*”, using “ *the feedback from families*” \[ **5.4**\]. 

 National charity Pact, who support parents and children affected by criminal justice, testify to the positive change brought about by the research: ‘ *One difficulty identified in 2017\-18 was the lack of information and guidance that people could rely on, when trying to support families affected by the IPP sentence. Dr Annison’s work … meets this need*.’ **\[5.10\]** Pact also run the Ministry of Justice\-funded Prisoners’ Families Helpline. They “ *provided informal ongoing support*” for Dr Annison’s research from 2017 onwards, and have welcomed the ‘Offering a Helping Hand’ booklet, sharing it “ *with all of our relevant helpline staff, so that they are better equipped to provide support to families in this situation*” \[ **5.10**\]. 

 Invisible Walls is an award\-winning initiative at HMP Winchester, whose Family Interventions Co\-ordinator stated that “ *feeling heard and realizing that their experience is shared by others can be massive help to prisoners and their families; the \[Offering a Helping Hand\] leaflet does that but also links to further useful information from the Parole Board and HMPPS for example*.” \[ **5.10**\]. The feedback received from families they work with to date “ *has been really positive*” \[ **5.10**\]. 

 Families have reported, “ *Your \[Offering a Helping Hand\] booklet is excellent Harry and the guidance and support in it has been very very much needed for 15 years. It is very informative, and sympathetic to everyone involved*.” \[ **5.10**\] POPS, another national charity supporting families affected by criminal justice, told us that the impacts achieved by Dr Annison “ *are important steps that, within the confines of the substantial political constraints on the IPP issue, address some of the key needs identified by ‘A Helping Hand’ and indeed which we had identified in our own work with families*.” \[ **5.10**\] 

 COVID\-19 has had a devastating impact on the criminal justice system from early 2020. Reflecting on the particular challenges posed by the pandemic, Invisible Walls stated “ *This is a particularly difficult time for those in the prison system, and the support and guidance of Southampton Law School has been very helpful for both IPP prisoners and their families*.” \[ **5.10**\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research at UCL’s Institute of Ophthalmology to develop gene therapies for inherited retinal diseases \(IRDs\) has led to a 2015 spin\-out company Athena Vision Ltd. and partnership with gene therapy company MeiraGTx, creating 85 jobs and generating significant initial investment of GDP20,000,000. MeiraGTx has built a MHRA\-registered current Good Manufacturing Practice \(cGMP\) facility for manufacturing of ocular gene therapies, and has a portfolio of products in clinical trials in Europe and the US for diseases including achromatopsia and retinitis pigmentosa. In 2019, MeiraGTx entered into a broad strategic collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, worth an initial USD100,000,000 to develop and commercialize its ocular products.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Inherited retinal diseases \(IRDs\) are collectively the commonest cause of sight impairment affecting children and young adults, with a global prevalence of 1 in 3,000 individuals. Gene defects are responsible for dysfunction and/or degeneration of retinal cells, causing severe impairment of sight from birth or during childhood. Sight impairment has a profound impact on affected individuals’ quality of life and independence, with significant financial cost to their families and to society. 

 UCL’s Institute of Ophthalmology has established an extensive programme of retinal gene therapy. In 2000, it demonstrated for the first time that recombinant adeno\-associated virus \(rAAV\) vectors can mediate efficient sustained delivery of genes to the retina, and provided the first robust proof\-of\-concept for gene therapy of retinal disease, using a rAAV vector to improve photoreceptor cell structure and function in a mouse model of IRD **\[R1\].** The group went on to build an expanding pipeline of candidate gene therapies for IRDs, publishing evidence of benefit in laboratory models of more than 15 different forms of the condition **\[R1\-R4\].** 

 In 2007 they launched the world’s first clinical trial of gene therapy for IRD, including 15 adults and children \(6 to 23 years of age\) with an early\-onset severe retinal dystrophy caused by defects in the gene encoding RPE65 \(retinal pigment epithelium–specific protein 65 kDa\). In 2008 they published the early results on the first 3 subjects, showing that the gene therapy improved retinal sensitivity and night vision **\[R5\]**. In 2015, they published the longer\-term results, showing that the benefits lasted at least 3 years for some patients after a single administration of the product **\[R6\]**. This work, along with trials for RPE65 gene therapy by two other groups, established a proof\-of\-principle for retinal gene therapy in humans with IRD and was recognised in 2018 by the award of the  Champalimaud Vision Prize \(EUR1,000,000\) jointly to Robin Ali and James Bainbridge and teams from Florida, Pennsylvania and the NIH. Bethesda. 

 The group has embarked on an accelerated clinical development programme and begun early phase trials for IRDs under their partnership with MeiraGTx as follows: 

-  2016 \- LCA2 \(RPE65 deficiency\): 15 participants, complete, showed benefit and is now supporting proposals for a pivotal trial. 

-  2017 \- congenital achromatopsia \(CNGB3 deficiency\): 21 participants, fully recruited and in follow\-up. 

-  2017 \- x\-linked retinitis pigmentosa \(RPGR deficiency\): 27 participants, ongoing, early results showing benefit supporting plans for a pivotal trial. 

-  2019 \- congenital achromatopsia \(CNGA3 deficiency\): 7 participants, recruitment ongoing. 

 In 2017, the group manufactured a clinical grade gene therapy vector for AIPL1 deficiency under a hospital exemption “Specials” licence and in 2019 provided experimental treatment for 4 affected infants \(outcome to be determined\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 In 2015, UCL supported the formation of biopharmaceutical spin out company Athena Vision Ltd and licences to intellectual property for a pipeline of four programmes of gene therapy for eye disease, with the sole purpose of accelerating the development of new products based on this body of research. Athena Vision Ltd attracted an initial investment of USD20,000,000 from MeiraGTx to develop and commercialise Athena's ocular gene therapy programme. Athena Vision Ltd. was subsequently acquired by the company in 2016 to complement their gene therapy technology portfolio. 

 In 2018, MeiraGTx floated on NASDAQ with a market capitalisation of USD425,000,000, raising USD75,000,000 at the close of its initial public offering. In January 2019, the company concluded a licensing deal for its four UCL\-led IRD programmes with Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. Janssen was drawn to collaborate with MeiraGTx because of their novel gene technology, internal manufacturing capabilities and IRD pipeline, based on UCL’s four early\-stage trials **\[S1\]**. These two companies agreed to collaborate in the clinical development of MeiraGTx’s leading IRD pipeline, including product candidates for achromatopsia \(ACHM, caused by mutations in either CNGB3 or CNGA3\) and X\-linked retinitis pigmentosa \(XLRP\). In addition, MeiraGTx and Janssen entered into a research collaboration covering MeiraGTx’s pipeline of pre\-clinical programs for IRDs, the development of AAV manufacturing technology, and supply agreements. Janssen is funding all clinical development and commercialization costs. The agreement gave MeiraGTx USD100,000,000 in up\-front costs, with a further USD390m in milestone payments to come, and stands to benefit from untiered royalty on annual net sales of commercialized products. 

 Through the continued collaboration between the Institute and MeiraGTx and its partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, the group has been able to accelerate its clinical programme and early phase trials. Impact from these trials so far include improved vision for 15 participants in completed trial testing of an optimised RPE65 vector **\[S2, S3\].** \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] **\[S1, S5\].** 

 To drive these four therapies towards commercialisation and patient delivery, MeiraGTx has brought considerable financial investment into the UK. In London, the company has established a presence in close proximity to UCL’s Institute of Ophthalmology, created 150 new jobs to date and established a Good Manufacturing Practice \(cGMP\) gene therapy production facility that meets MHRA, EMA and FDA regulatory standards to support plans for global commercialisation. This state\-of\-the\-art 29,000\-square foot manufacturing facility, completed in 2018, has the flexibility and capacity to produce sufficient product for all of the group’s clinical trials and can then scale to commercial capacity **.** More recently further investment was raised on the back of the London facility to extend MeiraGTx’s manufacturing capability with the construction of a USD70,000,000 manufacturing complex based in Shannon, Ireland to produce MeiraGTx’s gene therapy portfolio **\[S5,S6\].** \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] **\[S1\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Overseas aid can change the lives of the world’s poorest, but governments around the world struggle to win support for aid from their sceptical publics. One reason the British government has refocused aid policy from overseas needs to national interests is to win over its domestic audience. But can the public be persuaded that aid serves national interests? Essex\-led research addressing that question, co\-produced with the Department for International Development \(DFID\), contributed to reshaping the department’s communication strategy. Based on underpinning research on political opinion, a series of survey experiments tested existing and potential new DFID communications to identify whether and when citizens can be convinced that giving aid pays off at home. Key findings were that arguments about health and border security were persuasive and boosted support for aid, while neither general claims about national interests nor specific claims about economic benefits were found to be credible. These and other findings were used to update DFID’s communications guidelines and are evidenced in examples of Ministerial and Departmental social and print media messaging. It is rare for academic insights to be injected so directly into government communications – and thus given such reach.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Johns was Principal Investigator alongside co\-investigator Professor Graeme Davies on an ESRC\-funded study of public opinion on foreign policy \[G1\]. The research findings offered two relevant features: i\) an experimental method for testing different ‘national interest’ messages – that giving aid delivers benefits at home as well as abroad – on the public; and ii\) the first survey evidence of British public reactions to that key message. 

1.  *Testing the effects of different ‘national interest’ messages* 

 Professor Johns’ research was at the forefront of bringing the vignette\-based survey experimental methods into the mainstream of British public opinion research – and bringing the results into foreign policy circles. In this approach, the detail, context and framing of a policy are manipulated with a view to measuring their effect on public approval. Several publications by Johns and Davies \[R1\-R4\] report results from such experiments. \[R2\] showed the potential of Prime Ministerial rhetoric to persuade the public to support unpopular policies of appeasing adversaries. The experiments in \[R1\] and \[R4\] examined how the public balanced humanitarian and utilitarian motivations when considering the risks of military action. Most telling for DFID, \[R3\] revealed a public more responsive to national self\-interest than to ethical considerations when deciding whether to support multilateral action. 

 As a whole, this research demonstrated the strong potential of survey experiments: first, to examine what shapes support for different foreign policies; second, to gauge the effectiveness of different frames or phrases for conveying DFID’s chosen ‘national interest’ message. 

1.  *Public priorities: needs vs. interests* 

 The ESRC\-funded research \[G1\] also addressed DFID’s main concern directly, one question asking: “Some people say that Britain's foreign aid should simply be distributed to the countries which are most in need of help. Others say that we should put our own national interests first when deciding how to distribute foreign aid in the developing world. Which best represents your view?” As that government agenda gathered momentum, the research team – now joined by aid expert, Dr Simon Lightfoot – was able to repeat the question in 2015 and published a  [blog post based on the new results](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/uk-foreign-aid-what-do-the-british-public-think-aid-should-be-for/). In both surveys, the question revealed mixed opinions but a clear skew towards national interests. For an Essex workshop in 2016, the team wrote a working paper that analysed responses to the need\-interests question in more depth \[R5\]. It highlighted that those prioritising ‘interests’ were more sceptical about aid in general, questioning whether a national\-interests approach really would boost public support. 

 The marriage of substance and method was taken up again in co\-produced research with DFID. It was funded by an application by Professor Johns and co\-authors to the Universities of Essex and Leeds for matching ESRC Impact Acceleration Account funding. DFID provided a statement of support \[S2\]. A total of £20,000 \[G2\] was obtained for a two\-stage data collection: 

-  *Pilot:* testing ‘national interests’ messages to identify promising versions for the main experiment. \(Fielded via Prolific Academic, September 2017, N=1,995.\) 

-  *Main survey*: messaging experiments embedded among standard survey measures of attitudes, aid engagement and socio\-demographics. \(Fielded by BMG Research, October 2017, N=5,008.\) 

 The experimental designs were informed by DFID’s summary \[S2\] of what they had taken from the research so far and what they wanted to address further. DFID specified various broad narratives \(economic interests, global leadership, health security, and a general assertion that aid is in the national interest\) and a number of specific messages, some existing and some new wordings. These were incorporated alongside the team’s own research ideas; Professor Johns added variables by which to identify audiences more responsive to national\-interests frames. After piloting, the team reported key findings to DFID, informing refinements for the main data collection \[R6a\]. 

 That survey yielded a wide range of findings \[R6b,c\] which were condensed into four core insights for DFID \[R6d\]: 

1.  Specific projects are both more popular than aid in general *and* are more likely to convince British citizens that aid is in the national interest. 

1.  Mentioning the level of expenditure is counter\-productive, eroding support for aid even when justified in terms of national interests. 

1.  Different audiences responded to different security threats: 

  1.  *overall*, health security was the arena most likely to convince people of a national\- interests case for aid; 

  1.  *among the ‘marginally engaged’* \(DFID’s primary target group\), national and border security were more persuasive concerns. 

1.  General beats specific in claims about the domestic gains from aid. Specific predictions were not thought credible, partly because the causal chains \(e.g. investment in infrastructure in Ethiopia creates jobs and wealth on the ground there, which boosts export opportunities for British firms, which creates jobs in the UK\) are too complex. 

 Professor Johns also conducted a follow\-up analysis in February 2018, breaking down responses according to a new schema for ‘market segmentation’ adopted by DFID, based on media consumption \[R6e\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact process fell into four broad stages: initial engagement, co\-production of knowledge, presentation of findings, and updating of policy practice. 

 **Engagement** 

 Professor Johns presented the team’s early findings about public aid priorities \[R5\] at a workshop at Essex in April 2016. This was attended by DFID’s Head of Strategy and Insight \(Communications\) who noted the match with their policy interests and arranged a meeting at DFID on 7 July 2016 \[S1\]. The team presented the underpinning research \[R1\-5\], resulting in a stated interest from DFID for collaboration with Johns and co\-investigators \[S2\]. Findings would inform DFID’s Insights team about the efficacy of their narratives and thus improve their communications strategy \[S3a, b\]. 

 **Co\-production of knowledge** 

 This is described in detail in Section 2. The research most directly underpinning the impact, i.e. the IAA\-funded series of survey experiments testing DFID’s national interests messaging, was co\-produced with staff from DFID’s communications division \[R6\]. 

 **Presentation of findings** 

 The main findings were communicated via two meetings: first a debrief with the core DFID Insights team on 20 October 2017, and then a presentation to DFID’s senior communications team \-\- the Heads of Strategy & Insight and of Corporate Communications; the Deputy Director of Strategic Communications & Employee Engagement; and an Evaluation & Branding Advisor – on 15 December 2017 at the Department in Whitehall. 

 **Updating policy practice** 

 As summarised by a Communications Insight and Evaluations Adviser \[S4a\], the four core insights from Section 2 fell into two categories for DFID: \#1 and \#2 provided representative\-sample confirmation of indications they had from focus groups; \#3 and \#4 were new insights. All four fed into the Department’s communications practice. 

 The project’s impact was thus achieved via a two\-step process. First, research insights were used by DFID *to revise and update its guidance on communicating aid in the national interest*, the refreshed guidance then being circulated throughout DFID, notably its Communications Division. This dissemination process is summarised in a February 2018 e\-mail from the then Head of Strategy & Insight \[S5\]. 

 The second step was the *use of this refreshed guidance, and particularly our core insights, in writing Ministerial and Department communications*. DFID provided two specific examples of this via stories that it placed in the national media \(thereby highlighting the reach of the redesigned communications\) \[S4b\]. Example A reflects core insights \#3b, \#1 and \#4: it focuses on national security, the primary concern of the marginally engaged, and it reports on a specific project but makes only general claims about the benefits to the UK. Example B reflects core insights \#1 and \#2: specific projects with tangible outcomes are reported on, with expenditure relegated to the subheading. 

 A letter from DFID’s Director of Communications \[S6\] highlights the series ‘100 ways aid works’ as another strand of communications influenced by our insights. A sample of those social media posts and videos provides further illustration of the way in which the core insights listed in Section 2 were used to shape DFID’s communications \[S7\]. 

 That same letter \[S6\] also summarises the broader uses and impact of this research. It attests that the project achieved its core aim of informing and thus improving the way that DFID talks about aid and the national interest. It is rare for academic insights to be injected so directly into government communications, and thus for them to have such reach. 

 Two aspects of that reach are worth emphasising. The first is within government. As the Director of Communications puts it, our insights are \[text removed for publication\] \[S6\] – that is, not only throughout DFID but also in other aid\-spending departments. Second, the reach of the resulting communications is considerable. The \#100waysaidworks videos were circulated by a DFID Twitter account with close to half a million followers. This included relevant players within the aid policy community as well as the wider public. As illustrated, the latter are also targeted by adverts and placed stories in high\-circulation national newspapers such as *The Sun* and the *Guardian* online. 

 A postscript: the process described above all took place prior to DFID being folded into what became the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office. However, there is good reason to suppose that the impact is ongoing. This is partly because much of DFID’s operation transferred into the new department. Above all, though, it is because the national interest agenda remains prominent in UK Aid communications – indeed, that agenda was a driving motivation behind the merger.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The climate and biodiversity crisis shows that people’s relationships with nature are breaking down. Researchers at the University of Derby \(UoD\) have transformed the way people interact with nature to improve wellbeing and promote pro\-nature behaviour, by developing the ‘Pathways to Nature Connectedness’, a behaviour change framework that focuses on experiencing rather than mastering nature. The National Trust, Wildlife Trust, European Forest Therapy Institute, and the New Zealand Government Department of Conservation \(DOC\) have all made improvements to their policy and practice by adopting the framework, which has improved the wellbeing of the public. The creation of the Nature Connection Index \(NCI\) allowed Natural England to gain a population measure of the UK’s relationship with nature. The United Nations \(UN\) reviewed the framework, and it has influenced the development of the UN’s post\-2020 Biodiversity Framework.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Nature Connectedness Research Group \(NCRG\) was established at UoD in 2013 and has produced over 30 peer\-reviewed journal articles and received over £300,000 in external research funding \[G3.1, G3.2\]. In 2018, Universities UK recognised their work as one of the UK’s best 100 breakthroughs for research impact. The group is led by M. Richardson, core researchers include D. Sheffield, R. Lumber and K. McEwan. The group conducts behavioural research including: 

 ● A multi\-study project \(2013–16\) on the development of the ‘Pathways to Nature Connectedness’, has identified and operationalised five types of activity and relationships that improve people’s nature connectedness \[3.1\]. The foundational idea took Kellert’s nine values of biophillia from 1993 and identified those that improve nature connectedness through cross\-sectional research and final empirical testing. The pathways provide a unique framework for designing nature connectedness interventions, from visitor programming to green infrastructure design. 

 ● Development and evaluations of interventions to improve mental wellbeing and pro\-environmental behaviours by increasing nature connectedness. The research group worked with the Wildlife Trust to use the pathways in the design of the annual ‘30 Days Wild campaign’ \(2015–20\). Yearly evaluations have shown significant improvements in nature connection, health, happiness and conservation behaviours sustained for two months. An evaluation of 273 people who took part in the campaign identified specific groups within the population that benefitted most \[3.2\]. The clear rationale, theoretical basis, delivery, content and focus on defined outcomes, met criteria for public health interventions. 

 ● In 2016, a low\-cost intervention to improve nature connectedness was trialled with 92 participants; approximately half had to note three good things in nature every day \(intervention\) and were compared with the remainder who noted three factual things every day \(control\) \[3.3\]. The intervention group showed sustained and significant increases in nature connectedness compared to the control group. Increases in nature connectedness were associated with psychological health improvement in the intervention group. This research provided evidence that paying attention and noting the good things in nature each day can deliver sustained increases in people’s connection with nature. 

 ● An RCT \(n=582\) of a nature connectedness green prescription app \[3.4, G3.1\] based on noticing the good things in urban nature delivered clinically significant improvements in mental health. Providing everyday opportunities to improve wellbeing through engaging with urban nature using a brief, portable, widely accessible and cost\-effective smartphone app intervention is valuable new knowledge. 

 ● A key benefit of nature connectedness is pro\-nature behaviours. Although there are several measures of pro\-environmental behaviours \(broadly carbon/resource use\) related to climate warming, there were no psychometric scales to measure pro\-nature conservation behaviours \(broadly habitat creation or protection\) related to the crisis of biodiversity loss. Therefore, the NCRG developed the first scale to measure these behaviours \[3.5\] which subsequent research showed were increased by improved nature connectedness. 

 ● Psychometric scale development with the Nature Connection Index \(NCI\): a new population measure of nature connectedness developed for national statistical research \[3.6\]. To establish the reliability of the new Nature Connection Index \(NCI\) three factor analyses were conducted. One was based on a large Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment \(MENE\) dataset for adults \(n=3568\) with replication using datasets collected online \(n=553\), and a third used MENE data from children \(n=351\). MENE \(now called the People and Nature Survey\) was part of the UK’s national statistics and uses the robust protocols required when collecting data to inform policy. The results showed that the NCI was a reliable and valid scale for both children and adults, and they gave insights into the links between nature connectedness and pro\-nature behaviours.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Nature Connectedness is a recent psychological construct that benefits mental wellbeing and pro\-environmental behaviours. Researchers at UoD, led by Richardson, have discovered ways to improve nature connectedness that have changed the practices of UK \[5.1, 5.2, 5.3\] and European organisations \[5.4\] and the New Zealand government \[5.5\]. The research has also informed the implementation and evaluation of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ \(DEFRA’s\) 25 Year Environment Plan and Natural England’s 5\-year policy in the UK \[5.6, 5.7\]. It also influenced approaches to mental wellbeing in the UK and Europe \[5.8, 5.9\], and has been adopted by the UN \[5.10\]. 

 **Using the pathways framework to engage people, improve wellbeing and increase pro\-nature behaviours** 

 Research by Lumber *et al*. \[3.1\] identified the types of activity that led to improved nature connectedness in the ‘Pathways to Nature Connectedness’. The Wildlife Trust used the pathways to design and organise the ‘Random Acts of Wildness’ activities as part of their innovative ‘30 Days Wild’ national programme \[5.1\] which has run from 2015 to the present. Evaluations evidenced sustained improvements in happiness, health, nature connectedness and pro\-environmental behaviours \[5.1\] and over one million people have taken part over 5 years \[5.1\]. The greatest impact was among people who began the programme with lower nature connectedness \[5.1\]. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Following the success of the Wildlife Trust’s campaign, in 2018, the National Trust asked Richardson to produce an internal report introducing the evidence base for the benefits of nature connectedness. This resulted in the organisation embedding NCRG pathways into their practice and strategic vision for outdoor experience programming, which was available to the National Trust’s 6 million members and 25 million visitors from 2018 \[5.2\]. The Trust organised a series of workshops with staff who were responsible for the visitor experience, facilitated by videos and guidance on the pathways by UoD. One part of this work was a refresh of the national campaign ‘50 things to do before you’re 11<sup>3/4</sup>’ launched in Spring 2019, which activated the pathways to nature connectedness amongst children. The pathways approach will also form the basis of the new Easter 2021 programming. 

 The new ‘50 Things’ campaign was implemented in at least 270 properties and led to a 405% increase in web traffic and engagement and has shown a positive impact on visitors’ nature connection as well as enrichment of the visitor experience overall \[5.2\]. A National Trust Project Manager remarked: <sup>“</sup> *The \[UoD\] research has really helped the National Trust find ways to encourage visitors to connect to nature and therefore our places in new and more meaningful ways. For the staff it has given a clear framework for how to shape activities to provide richer and more immersive experiences, transforming garden tours, ranger days, dawn chorus events, season long programs, national campaigns \(like ‘50 things’\) and everything else in\-between. For some this has been a considerable shift from a knowledge\-based approach to a more personal one, but many have adopted it with enthusiasm and the emerging results have been transformational. For visitors, the change in approach to these activities has helped them to see our places in a new way, develop much deeper appreciation and connection, and ultimately inspiring them to want to care for nature in a better way”* \[5.2\]. The National Trust Head of Insight remarked: “ *The work on Pathways, translated into practical guidance for our teams, has resulted in a transformation in how we design nature experiences, as well as our ‘on property programming…’*” It has been, “ *a positive cultural change*”. Furthermore, the approach: “… *had a dramatic impact into our wider communications…* \[We\] *…have translated the principles of the pathways into operational guidance, as well as a language guide on nature communications.*” Additionally, it: “… *significantly shifted the focus of our marketing and communications teams … inspiring creativity for our in\-house marketing teams to deliver a more profound and purpose\-led approach to engaging people with nature at a time of crisis. We took this further through a high\-profile TV advertising campaign, which again, founded on principles and evidence we established through our work with the team at Derby”* \[5.2\]. 

 More organisations across the UK are now using UoD research to inform their work, including: the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds \(RSPB\), to inform their evaluation and engagement work \[5.3\] and their ‘nature prescription’ offer in Scotland \[5.3\]; the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust are using the Pathways as a guiding principle to establish the Trust as a fore\-runner in promoting nature connectedness \[5.3\]; and the Derby Museum, who experienced a 100% increase in exhibit dwell times after UoD research informed new exhibit design \[5.3\]. Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust are using the pathways research to inform organisational guidelines for visitor experience. The Durrell Director of Conservation Science stated: *“In 2017, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust launched its new 2018*– *2025 organisational strategy which put nature connection front and centre of what we do… The Pathways to Nature Connectedness research provides a really useful framework for reframing and designing many of the ways we interact with…people…The Pathways research feeds directly into a set of organisational guidelines”* \[5.3\]. 

 Internationally, the pathways form a key part of the ‘5x5’ Forest Bathing training provided by the European Forest Therapy Institute to influence the practice of 180 practitioners from 30 countries including Turkey, Ireland, UK, USA, Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Spain, Portugal, Croatia, Slovenia, Slovakia and Costa Rica \[5.4\]. The pathways framework changed the practice of the New Zealand Department for Conservation \(DOC\) who collaborated with the UK National Trust and implemented their own version of the ‘50 things’ campaign \[5.5\]. In an emergency response to the COVID\-19 pandemic, the international charity, SOS Children’s Villages International \(SOS CVI\), used UoD’s ‘good things in nature’ intervention \[3.3, 3.4\] as part of the resources provided to improve the psychological health of their staff, children and community during the lockdown in Italy \[5.8\]. 

 **Influencing policy change in the UK and Internationally** 

 Research conducted by the NCRG has influenced a number of national and international policies for nature, environments and wellbeing. The NCRG worked closely with Natural England to inform the development and evaluation of DEFRA’s 25 Year Environment Plan \[5.6\], published in 2018, which included policy on ‘connecting people with the environment to improve health and wellbeing’. Richardson is an invited member of Natural England’s Strategic Research Committee leading projects such as the validation of the Nature Connections Index \(NCI\) \[3.6\], used for population survey work \[5.7\].  In 2020, nature connectedness was included in Natural England’s new online People and Nature Survey \(formerly the MENE Survey\), the world’s largest survey of people’s interaction with outdoor green spaces, using the UoD\-developed NCI measure \[5.7\]. The UoD\-developed Pro\-nature Conservation Behaviours Scale was also included \[3.5, 5.7\]. The results from this survey provided information on how COVID\-19 affected the population’s relationship with nature. The group’s research is also cited in the September 2019 DEFRA review of National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Beauty and is the only research evidence cited in Natural England’s new 5\-year plan in relation to the aim to connect people with nature \[5.6\]. Nature connectedness now forms a key part of Natural England’s 5\-year plan and is one of the four strategic areas of focus. Richardson also chairs the expert advisory group on the UK Government 25YEP Nature Friendly Schools programme to create nature\-friendly schools. 

 Natural England’s Principal Adviser stated: “ *The insight provided through research led by Derby University into the relationship between nature connection and wellbeing and a range of pro\-environmental and pro\-nature behaviours has made a profound impact on Natural England’s approach to public engagement and the means of evaluating the impact of that engagement work”* \[5.7\]. The impact is further illustrated by the fact that applicants to the Connecting People with Nature stream of the Government’s GBP40,000,000 Green Recovery Challenge Fund \(GRCF\) were directed to work on the pathways to nature connectedness framework in a key part of the funding guidance administered by the National Heritage Lottery Fund \[5.7\]. 

 The charity, Student Minds, used NCRG research \[3.3, 3.4\] to develop the ‘University Mental Health Charter’, launched in 2019 with the support of the Universities Minister, and is currently using the University of Derby as a pilot site to implement the Charter Award Scheme \[5.9\]. A consumer version of the mental health smartphone intervention developed during G3.1 and found to be effective \[3.4\], was released as part of the Go Jauntly App in May 2020. Between launch and 14 August 2020, the app had 30,701 downloads; a 300% increase compared with the 3 months pre\-launch \[5.9\]. Internationally, the DOC implemented NCRG research into their national teacher training course to improve nature connectedness among New Zealand children \[5.5\]. The Outreach and Education Coordinator commented: “ *Since the introduction of the Pathways to Nature Connectedness research into the team, there has been a shift in focus on how we develop and promote nature\-based learning. The research has been a key factor in shaping the strategic direction of DOC’s education engagement from development of resources to promotion campaigns.* *The marketing and social media teams have identified the pathways as a key tool for engaging new and old audiences in national conservation campaigns”* \[5.5\]. 

 Richardson was invited to co\-author the ‘Connecting People with Nature’ \[5.10\] report by the Children & Nature Network, a US non\-profit organisation aimed at improving children’s access and interaction with nature globally. The report was presented at the November 2018 UN Convention on Biological Diversity. This led to a call for the pathways model to be included in the post\-2020 Biodiversity Framework \[5.10\] in order to achieve the UN’s Strategic Plan and Aichi Biodiversity Targets to promote pro\-nature behaviours and improve mental wellbeing.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Moscati’s work on sexual and gender diversity in mediation has been integrated into the work of national mediation bodies and organisations supporting couples and children through family conflict in the UK and Italy, resulting in: 

-  Changes to the policies and practices of mediation bodies and organisations supporting couples and children through family conflict; and 

-  Improvements in the training of new and existing family mediators. 

 Her work has also created new understanding in other European countries of the diversity of family structures and what this means for professionals and service providers who work with families. It is contributing to more responsive – and therefore more effective – mediation and dispute resolution services for the sexually\- and gender\-diverse couples, families and children using them. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 European legislators and governments emphasise the use of mediation and its benefits for families, in terms of avoiding the often taxing and potentially damaging experiences of engaging with the formal legal system. At the same time, European countries increasingly recognise same\-sex and gender\-diverse relationships in a variety of forms. Despite these phenomena, mediation and dispute resolution services have continued to prioritise the needs of heteronormative relationships, assimilating the experiences of sexually\- and gender\-diverse couples and their children on the basis of hetero\-normative assumptions \(R4\). These overlook: the variety of family structures, the way in which children are conceived, the lack of harmonious legal frameworks and their impact, and the existence of social prejudices and stigma. As a result, inadequate attention has been paid to the particular needs of families that do not conform to the heteronormative family model, including in their diverse structures \(R2, R3\). Moscati’s research, building on her particular expertise and experience in the UK and Italy, addresses this gap. It breaks with traditional approaches to family mediation, and to the involvement of children during family mediation, to suggest a theoretical approach which draws upon the intersection of dispute resolution, access to justice discourses, the concept of ‘child protagonism’ which recognises the agency of the child and their ability to contribute to processes that affect them, and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child \(R4\). 

 The research addresses the following questions: First, what is the nature of disputes within sexually\- and gender\-diverse families? Second, to what extent and why do sexually\- and gender\-diverse families or family members resort to mediation? Third, what kind of issues arise during family mediation within sexually\- and gender\-diverse families? Finally, in what ways and to what extent might the concept of ‘children’s protagonism’ be effective when applied to the role of children during such family mediation experiences? 

 Moscati’s research methodology critically applies dispute resolution literature in the context of same\-sex legislative developments and related family mediation in the selected jurisdictions. It is also based on qualitative methods which include: semi\-structured interviews with same\-sex couples, lawyers, mediators and judges; a survey of mediation service\-providers’ websites; and analysis of Moscati’s training for mediators \(Section 4\). Through the use of these methods the findings demonstrated that: 

-  Recourse to mediation for sexually\- and gender\-diverse families is still limited; 

-  In the jurisdictions analysed, there are no specific guidelines for mediators regarding mediation with sexually\- and gender\-diverse families \(R3\); 

-  There is a lack of informative, relevant material focusing on the needs of partners and children in sexually\- and gender\-diverse families \(R4\); 

-  Mediators tend to assimilate members of sexually\- and gender\-diverse families, adopting the same styles and models of practice as they use for third party intervention in disputes within heterosexual and cisgender family settings \(R4\); 

-  Debates and practices relating to the involvement of children during family mediation overlook the needs of children raised in sexually\- and gender\-diverse families \(R3\); 

-  Religion may influence dispute resolution between same\-sex couples in several ways, including causing family disputes, determining whether and how to take legal steps, and influencing the mediation process \(R1\); 

-  Domestic violence and abuse between lesbian partners can be a source of dispute and may influence the mediation process \(R5\). 

 The data collected has provided new insights into family mediation, with implications for policy, practice and training. Furthermore, the findings have filled a gap in the literature and practice of family mediation and increased understanding of the many reasons members of sexually\- and gender\-diverse families attend mediation, including common grievances around parenting and finances, but also problems relating to coming out, sexual and gender identity, and internalised homophobia, biphobia and transphobia. 

 While research on these issues began prior to Dr Moscati joining the University of Sussex, the majority of this body of work was conducted and published – and the most significant and tangible impact activity was undertaken – after January 2015 \(when Dr Moscati started her appointment at Sussex\) and while she, as Principal Investigator, coordinated ‘Litigious Love: Same\-Sex Couples and Mediation in the EU’, the first comparative project on this topic \(R2, R3\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Moscati’s research has been used to: 1\) diversify mediation policy and practice at an organisational level; 2\) secure changes in mediation training leading to improved mediation practice; and 3\) help to put these issues on the agenda at national and local levels. Her work – which is ongoing – has helped to make mediation guidance and resources more inclusive. Moreover, it has been adapted to specific national contexts: in Italy, many of those receiving training based on her work were encountering same\-sex mediation issues for the first time. However, in the UK, her work contributed to an existing understanding of same\-sex relationship breakdowns by promoting greater support across the LGBTIQ\+ spectrum, to include the needs of trans and non\-binary couples and families. 

 Moscati has also used her research in creative ways, including writing a book to support children from diverse family structures when relationships break down – ‘ [*Rainbow After the Storm*](https://www.academia.edu/29641881/Rainbow_after_the_Storm_Mylo_and_his_dads_go_to_the_mediator) *’* – which is available in five languages and free to download \(to date more than 500 downloads\). This has been of benefit at a local level; for example, the joint Headteachers of one London primary school – where Moscati talked to Year 6 students – described how this enabled students ‘to speak openly about themselves without masking their emotions’ \(S9\). 

 **4.1 Diversifying mediation policy and practice** 

 Moscati’s work with the UK College of Mediators \(CoM\) – an independent standards\-setting organisation that approves mediation training providers and membership body for mediation with more than 350 practicing members – has informed CoM policy and, through that, mediation practice in the UK. After delivering a workshop at the CoM 2018 AGM, she was invited to join the College’s Diversity and Inclusion Working Group. She is also Co\-editor of the CoM journal ‘Mediation Theory and Practice’ \(S1.1, S1.2\). 

 As a member of the Working Group, in November 2020, Moscati contributed to drafting a new diversity policy for the CoM. Together with contributing to the drafting of the whole policy, Moscati drafted the principle of the policy which links diversity in mediation to intersectionality. Once approved by the CoM Board in 2021, the policy will be provided to all CoM members to use in their client practice, as well as being incorporated into the training, networking days, monthly digests and conferences of the College that benefit its 350 members \(S1.3\). According to the Chair of CoM’s Professional Standards Committee, Moscati’s research ‘has made a very valuable contribution in helping mediators to broaden their understanding of the nature of intra\-family disputes between same sex partners, and in equipping them with the tools to support parties to mediation more effectively’ \(S1.1\). 

 Moscati’s research has influenced the work and communications approach and materials of Resolution, a UK\-based organisation with a membership of 6,500 family lawyers and other professionals working on the resolution of family disputes and providing public information. Resolution’s Director of Operations wrote: 

 ‘We first encountered Maria's booklet, ‘Rainbow after the storm \- Mylo and his Dads go to the mediator’, which presents in an engaging and clear way the many different family dynamics that a child may experience. The resource highlighted that our current materials only spoke of divorce and separation within heterosexual relationships. As a result, we \[are\] now reviewing and updating our materials.’ \(S2.1\). 

 Two years later, she stated that ‘those conversations and the use of Maria's publication came early on in our work around diversity so their impact was profound and felt across the organisation’ and ‘Maria's publication was part of a really important change in focus and approach for the organisation, one we're still working on’ \(S2.2\). 

 In 2017, the UK charity \[text removed for publication\] \(S3.1\). \[text removed for publication\] \(S3.2, S3.3\) 

 The GeA \(Genitori Ancora\) is the first established school of mediators in Italy and has similarly adapted its approaches and materials in response to Moscati’s work. In addition to the training module it has introduced \(see below\), GeA has improved its mediation forms to include gender\-neutral language, previously based on the binary male/female distinction \(S4.2\). 

 **4.2 Changes in mediation training and practice** 

 In Italy, Moscati’s research has been the inspiration for GeA’s development of a compulsory module on same\-sex couples and mediation as part of its annual professional training for mediators, a module which Moscati has delivered since 2017 \(S4.2, S4.6, S4.7\). As their  training coordinator, Paolo Scotti, explained in 2017: ‘Moscati’s initiatives have allowed us to tackle a theme that is still in its infancy in Italy and is suffering from a difficulty linked to the absence of trained and serious trainers’ \(S4.1\). In November 2020, GeA’s subsequent training coordinator, Ilaria Viganò, testified to the impact that had been realised: 

 ‘This is the fourth edition of Dr. Moscati's training \(2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020\) and in all about seventy professionals, mediators and others, participated. Over the years, the attitudes of the participants have definitely changed: every year there is a more active participation, a greater ability to become aware of their own prejudices and the desire to further explore the various issues that have emerged. Both during the seminar and in the questionnaires completed afterwards, to which I refer for specific comments, the majority of the participants pointed out that the training provided them with a much broader knowledge of LGBT families, often confused with homosexual families only, and made them take awareness of the impact that gender identity and the acceptance of one's sexual orientation can have in the parents' experience, and in the mediation room, topics that are still too little talked about in Italy.’ \(S4.4\) 

 For mediation students and their trainers, Moscati’s training provided a new formative space for participants to, as one family mediation course tutor stated, ‘reflect on their stereotypes and prejudices, on the roles of biological and social parent and in particular on how to deal with the different dynamics that arise from the situations of conflicting separation’ \(S4.5\). A participant in Moscati’s training in October 2020 stated ‘I think it \[the training\] will change my way of thinking and feeling and therefore of listening and understanding parents more free from prejudice’ while another said ‘I feel I have gained more tools to carry out work with non\-heterosexual couples’ \(S4.10\). 

 GeA was the first Italian mediation school to introduce this module; however, other mediation providers in Italy have since used Moscati’s training \(S7\). 

 The research has contributed to the development of a Masters course for future mediators at the University of Verona. \[text removed for publication\] \(S5\). 

 In the UK, the research has underpinned the development of a training programme accredited by the College of Mediators, delivered by prominent family mediator Stuart Hanson, whose own mediation company website ‘attracts in excess of 40,000 visitors a year’ \(S6.2\). As a result of the training, mediation practitioners have made changes, such as ‘amending their websites and literature to include the LGBT flag and including gender neutral language’ \(S6.1\). Hanson has also used Moscati’s work to improve his own firm’s training and services, stating that: ‘As a firm, we have made a commitment to being inclusive and on the basis of Dr. Moscati’s work, we have done the following: 

-  Rewritten our policies and procedures to be gender neutral 

-  Created interactive forms that when asking about gender include non\-binary 

-  Challenged the Legal Aid Agency and the Family Mediation Council on their position of recording gender as just male or female 

-  Given our staff training on not assuming a heterosexual normative when speaking with clients 

-  Emailed out to LGBT\+ charities, including Stonewall, to try and engage with the community 

-  Future plans include doing targeting SEO on the LGBT\+ community via our blog’ \(S6.2\). 

 A member of the CoM Professional Standards Committee, herself a practicing mediator, stated that: ‘Maria’s booklet for children of same sex parents who are separating is highly accessible and gives messages of importance to children, parents and mediators alike. I train mediators to meet with children directly in mediation and I refer to the booklet regularly on the training and provide details on the booklist’ \(S1.2\). 

 **4.3 Developing understanding among European countries** 

 Moscati’s work has informed ‘DoingRight\(s\)’, an Erasmus project to develop a trans\-national and cross\-sectoral curriculum on family diversity and raise awareness of family diversity in European countries, thus ensuring that mediation was included in the project’s remit. The project concluded in February 2020 with outputs including ‘Key training challenges for professionals working with LGBT parents and their children’ \(S8.3\). Moscati’s work was used to underpin the section on LGBT families. According to the Principal Investigator, this meant that ‘mediators have been targeted as pivotal figures in the “law” section, while previously they were not foreseen’ \(S8.1\). She adds: ‘\[Moscati’s\] insights supported the development of the outputs in relation to topics such as how the rules of law affect family perception and daily life; power imbalance within the couple, shaping the relationship; variety of children conception and raised; strategies to make explicit family structure and configuration’ \(S8.2\). In addition, she confirms: ‘These outputs have been disseminated in Italy, Spain and Poland through 8 public events, national and international. Total participants were 690. They were mostly lawyers, psychologists, social workers’ \(S8.2\). In this way, Moscati’s work has put sexual and gender diversity in family mediation and dispute resolution on the agenda in numerous new contexts.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Whilst an ageing population is seen as a global phenomenon, in China this population is rising more rapidly than in many other countries. As a consequence, demand for health care has increased, and delivering a good\-quality service is a challenge for providers. Research from the University of Reading on an integrated clinical pathway management approach and a digital platform has been used by over 1,000 major public hospitals \(over 400 Grade A hospitals\) and 1,400 suburban hospitals, covering 31 provinces and 200 cities in China. Informing the decision\-making of over 1,500,000 doctors, the integrated pathway management approach has improved the quality of hospital service and increased capacity, with reduced medical error, reduced patient waiting time, shorter hospital stays, and fewer unnecessary tests. The successful adoption of this research also led to the growth of the Chinese company, Sinldo Information Technology \(Beijing\) Co. Ltd, where Li is the Scientific Advisor and which is now listed on a Chinese Stock Exchange. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 In addition to China's large \(1,400,000,000\) and ageing population, shortages in critical health and care workers have compounded the demand for health care, in a country where major hospitals can have over 4,000 beds, with outpatient volumes of 4,000,000 patients per year. Within this context, research at the University of Reading has addressed how the quality, efficiency and safety of hospital services can be significantly improved through the effective use of information, data and clinical pathway knowledge. Prior to this, there was limited research on integrating best\-practice clinical pathways with local hospital practices and existing technical information systems. Although digital systems are increasingly used in hospitals, they form information silos; thus, their effectiveness has been limited, owing to a lack of alignment with clinical pathways. By developing an integrated clinical pathway platform, the research has addressed the lack of connection between best practice clinical pathways, local hospital practices and existing hospital information systems. 

 Funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC\), this research first developed a theoretical underpinning and a co\-designed research methodology for integrated pathway management by drawing on organisational semiotics. Led by Li \(Ref 1\), the integrated clinical pathway management approach was piloted by working closely with key hospital staff in selected hospitals \(Hospitals 301 and 309, China\), including the hospital’s Director of Information. It built on research understanding and encoding the complex clinical pathway knowledge into a knowledge\-based management system \(Ref 2\). The first pilot in Hospital 301 was with 70 staff participants; the second pilot, funded by the hospital R&D fund, was implemented in Hospital 309 and a total of 342 patient pathways were analysed. The findings since the second pilot \(in 2014\) show that the integrated clinical pathway management approach and the digital platform can significantly reduce medical errors, costs and waiting times \(Ref 1\). 

 The introduction of the co\-designed integrated pathway management approach through agent technology differentiates this work from other clinical decision systems; it generates a personalised patient support pathway, whereby best\-practice clinical pathways are integrated with existing hospital processes and information systems. Further work on the integrated digital platform has incorporated cloud and mobile technology for wider adoption \(Ref 3\). Having received funding from Sinldo Information Technology, ESRC, and NSFC, the innovative approach is now enabling further collaborative research, with data generated from the integrated hospital data platforms informing medical science and the pharmaceutical industry on differing medication patterns for different patient groups \(Ref 4\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Improving hospital practices and patient experience 

 Responding to the challenge of rapidly increasing health\-care demand in China, research at the University of Reading has underpinned a major change in hospital practice across the country. In addition to improving clinical outcomes, it has brought significant benefit to the quality of the patient experience prior to, during and after a hospital visit. Through the development of a digital integrated clinical pathway management approach, and a digital platform linked to existing hospital information systems, the research has enabled up\-to\-date clinical pathway knowledge and healthcare data to be readily accessible through mobile technology by the patient, clinician and hospital management. In so doing, it has considerably improved hospital service capacity, and reduced medical error, patient waiting time, length of hospital stay, and unnecessary tests. At the same time, it has increased patient surgery and patient referrals. The integrated clinical pathway approach has also been responsible for improved diagnoses, resulting in the saving of lives \[sources 5 to 7\]. 

 Through successful pilots in collaboration with Chinese hospitals, the novel approach was developed and demonstrated by the Reading team. On the basis of this approach, and informatic tools derived from the research, the Sinldo Information Technology company was set up, with Li acting as the Scientific Advisor \(see below\). By 2018, research at Reading had underpinned the delivery of bespoke digital platforms and integrated clinical pathway management systems across 2,400 hospitals in China \[source 1\]; this includes 1,000 major public hospitals \(over 400 Grade A hospitals\) and 1,400 suburban hospitals, covering 31 provinces and 200 cities in China \[source 4\]. In summary, the research outcome has been translated into products and services including the following: 

1.  A digital platform 

-  a knowledge\-based platform to facilitate decision making based on best\-practice clinical pathways, integrated with existing hospital systems 

-  front\-end applications for doctor workstations \(providing integrated information on patient pathway activities, treatment progression and patient condition\), and nurse workstations \(providing integrated information on care activities and patient condition every day along the pathway\) 

-  patient applications \(integrating hospital service information along a patient’s journey\). 

1.  A consulting tool to map best\-practice clinical pathways to local hospital processes \(outpatient and inpatient processes, and doctors’ working processes\) with the support of the digital platform. 

 The research has enabled better utilisation of health\-care resources and improved service quality, despite the dramatically increasing demand for health care. It supports 1,500,000 doctors and helps 600,000,000 outpatients and 25,000,000 inpatients each year by enabling the right information to be available at the right time on the clinical pathway. Moreover, it supports hospital services for 480,000,000 patients with hypertension, 350,000,000 patients with cardiovascular disease, 270,000,000 patients with diabetes and 120,000,000 patients with cancer \[source 9\] every year. 

 According to statistics from 100 major hospitals that applied this research, it has on average reduced medical error by 30% \(from an average of 252 adverse events and prescribing errors on six disease pathways during six months before implementation to 168 adverse events and prescribing errors after implementation\), and reduced waiting times by 50%, patient record and treatment data accessing times by 90%, and admission/discharge/referral times by 85%, with a total reduction of average length of stay from 12 days to 10 days \[source 6\]. Specifically, 23 hospitals were assessed for detailed impact \(31 pieces of evidence collected\). 

 For example, Wuhan Central Hospital adopted the mobile health application for integrated care service in September 2014. By December 2015, 98% of patients felt the process had been improved; there was a 55–83% reduction in medical errors; a 27% reduction in unnecessary tests and an 80% reduction in waiting times. The average time for patient record updating \(including in ICU\) was reduced by 24.4 hours. Due to the significant reduction in waiting time, the overall outpatient time was reduced from 260 to 170 minutes, while the average inpatient stay was reduced by 176.8 hours \[source 6 and ref 4\]. 

 A further example is that of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University, which adopted a hospital\-wide information integration platform in 2015. This has significantly improved the hospital’s service capacity: completed outpatient cases increased by 62%, completed inpatient cases increased by 49%, completed surgery cases increased by 99%, outpatient cost reduced by 9% and patient referrals increased by 40% \[source 6\]. This has benefited patients by improving their experience of hospital \(through reduced waiting times and fewer medical errors\), benefited doctors by providing them with more efficient workplaces, benefited hospital chief executives by giving them an improved overview of performance supported by an integrated data platform, and benefited hospitals by improving their use of resources and the quality of the service they offer. 

 Professor Xijing He, the former dean of the hospital, confirms that “the integrated clinical pathway platform enabled seamless access to various systems linking to doctors’ mobile applications, where they can get the most up\-to\-date information at the point of care. Furthermore, with the best practice clinical pathway knowledge incorporated in the digital platform, doctors will be warned of abnormal values \(in patient test results\) … for timely interventions, which ensures patient safety and service quality” \[source 6\]. 

##  Adoption and commercialisation of the research 

 As a result of the Reading team’s research, a system was developed with Sinldo which embraced the integrated clinical pathway management approach. In order to maximise care provision, it bridged the gap between healthcare best practices and the patient journey. Through Li’s continued engagement with these hospitals, she was instrumental in demonstrating more broadly to the Chinese health\-care sector the added value of the informatics tools developed. She also successfully pitched the potential of these artificial\-intelligence\-based systems to investors \[source 1\]. The number of employees in the company grew from 89 in 2014 to 171 in 2017, and it has received four rounds of financing/investment \(attracting GBP14,568,598 in total\) since 2013 \[sources 2–4\]. In April 2017, Sinldo was listed on the National Equities Exchange and Quotations \(NEEQ\) stock market \[source 2\]. It was recognised as China’s first digital health company listed on that market since China’s national strategy of “Internet \+ Health” was introduced in 2015. This has also given Sinldo a means to make an eventual transition to being listed on the main stock exchanges in the future and competing with larger firms. 

 Hongqiao Yang, Chairman of Sinldo Information Technology \(Beijing\) Co. Ltd. confirms that “Sinldo became a leading technology company providing a data integration platform and Weizi \[Li\] has been playing a key role in research and development before and after Sinldo’s establishment. The successful pilots of her research outcome led to the start of the company and she has been working continuously with the company team and hospital staff to develop applications in different hospitals. Weizi’s research has brought inspiration and innovation in our products and our partnership development with hospitals and investors.” \(source 1\) 

 This research from the University of Reading, which was a winner in the 2018 ESRC Excellence in Impact Awards \[source 8\], has made a highly significant contribution to addressing the challenge of providing high\-quality health care to the whole of the Chinese population, considered to be the fastest\-growing elderly population globally. Through the design, implementation and subsequent commercialisation of appropriate informatics technology, it has improved patient health outcomes through increased efficiency and efficacy of hospital service delivery, reaching 600 million outpatients and 25 million inpatients each year. Critical to this has been the encoding of the complex clinical pathway information into a knowledge\-based management system. For the Chinese nation, this has been highly significant, with both social and economic benefits in terms of increased efficiency and improved health outcomes. For individuals, it has meant not just a decrease in inconvenience \(for example, through shorter waiting times, referral times and length of hospital stay\), but for many patients, it has provided more fundamental benefits, such as reduced medical errors, with lifesaving ramifications.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Ekiti is a state in Nigeria, with a population of around 2,200,000. Prior to 2015 there was no formal Information and Communications Technology \(ICT\) training delivered in Ekiti schools due to a lack of skills, low staff confidence, and insufficient digital infrastructure. Between 2018\-2020, Northumbria University’s DIGISTEM project \(funded by the World Bank\) designed and delivered interventions for digital skills training for teachers. In addition to reaching 3,745 teachers, thus significantly increasing access to ICT skills in state schools, this work directly led to a 30% increase in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics \(STEM\) subject enrolment in participating schools. Northumbria researchers also contributed to rapid response efforts in Ekiti State during the COVID\-19 pandemic, helping to ensure that around 35,000 students remained engaged with learning activities during lockdown. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2018, Nigeria’s Ministry of Education stated in their ‘2018\-2022 Education for Change: A Ministerial Strategic Plan’ report that digital skills training in children’s education was hampered by a range of structural problems. These included a lack of digital infrastructure and resources, the number of teachers with low digital skills and low confidence in using digital resources as educational tools, and low enrolment in STEM classes, especially among young women. The Ministry of Education identified these issues as a strategic priority, in order to develop the digital economy and offer improved educational and career opportunities to Ekiti children. Ekiti State only began offering ICT training in schools in 2015, and teachers’ skills and resources were insufficient to deliver this new strategy. 

 Researchers from the Northumbria University Digital Learning Lab \(DLL\) have an established research history in applying digital literacy and access to technology to the field of education. Initial DLL research \[ **R1**\- **R3**\] established the use of digital games to teach mathematics to children, and these early results were followed up by studies of their acceptance and incorporation into the curriculum by teachers in Nigeria \[ **R4**\- **R6**\]. 

 DLL established that few studies have either examined the design process for digital educational games or considered how they can provide engagement experiences comparable to those found in entertainment\-focused games \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. Even fewer studies have specifically investigated how aspects of inclusivity and diversity can be built into games \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. A series of qualitative interviews and surveys with students and young people \(aged 7\-16\) investigated what features of entertainment games children engaged with. This led to a ‘framework’ of features that could be used to build a more sustained and effective learning experience in educational games \[ **R1**\]. These included: clarity of goal, thematic appeal, visual appeal, rewards, feedback, social interaction, creativity, challenge, and immersion \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. 

 DLL applied this framework to a new mathematics teaching game, *SpeedyRocket,* which used spaceflight to teach basic mathematical principles. By embedding the identified engagement factors into the design and development of *SpeedyRocket*, researchers created an immersive educational experience that not only offered the key entertainment factors that typically engage children, but also empowered student learning \[ **R2**, **R3**\]. *SpeedyRocket* adapted to the learning pace of the student and offered learners some level of control and ownership of the learning process, thereby fostering better understanding and retention of concepts \[ **R2**\]. The researchers evaluated engagement factors with children in Ekiti State by asking participants to rank them according to how they affected their enjoyment of the game. This revealed gendered differences; male students preferred to play games that are challenging and centred on achievement, competition, and feedback; females were more interested in instructive games that provided clear aims and allowed them to interact socially and share their experience with others \[ **R2**\]. 

 In addition to this work, DLL also considered the needs of teachers in schools with differing access to technology, internet, and electricity \[ **R4**\- **R6**\]. DLL adapted a pre\-existing Technology Acceptance Model \(TAM\) – an evaluation tool used to assess how the design of some technology or artefact meets the needs of the intended users, in order to encourage its adoption. This modified TAM included factors identified by teachers that made them more or less likely to use digital games in the classroom \[ **R4**, **R5**\]. A mixed methods approach drew on DLL’s previous studies with teachers, complemented by action research with 220 teachers in Nigeria, and generated insights into how the modified TAM could better incorporate contextual external variables specific to the teaching environment \[ **R4**, **R5**\]. For example, although the internet and digital devices are becoming increasingly accessible to people in Nigeria, classroom adoption and integration levels are still low, due to low teacher confidence and lack of familiarity with using digital tools in classrooms \[ **R6**\]. The modified TAM was then tested independently by discipline experts \[ **R4**\] and 20 science teachers in Ekiti State, Nigeria, through a combination of focus groups and questionnaires \[ **R6**\]. Results showed that the main barriers to the adoption and integration of ICT in the classroom included a lack of adequate and well\-trained personnel, poor internet service, and high cost of access \[ **R6**\]. 

 Taken together, the insights of these research projects resulted in the DIGISTEM project \(2018\-2020\), managed by DLL researchers. The project aim was to use digital tools to address \(1\) stereotypical and negative views held by young people about science and scientists, \(2\) the gendered delivery of science and digital education in formal learning environments, and \(3\) the narrow aspirations of young people. The game engagement framework \[ **R1**, **R2**\] led to the development of *SpeedyRocket* \[ **R2**, **R3**\], which, together with the TAM work \[ **R4**\- **R6**\], formed the basis of the case for support for DIGISTEM. DIGISTEM was delivered in partnership with the Nigerian StemRes Learning Initiative and sponsored by the World Bank through their State Education Program Investment Project.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Northumbria University’s DLL advised Ekiti State on key policies, programmes, and interventions around digital literacy and technology\-enhanced teaching, and accepted an invitation from the Deputy Governor to design interventions with the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology \(MoEST\). Professional development courses, workshops, seminars, and training sessions were delivered to their schoolteachers in 2018\-2020 through the DIGISTEM project and Northumbria University’s in\-house STEM outreach team NUSTEM, in partnership with Nigerian educational outreach organisation ‘StemRes’. These activities, in addition to DLL leading the design and delivery of the online teaching response to the Covid\-19 crisis with MoEST, enabled rapid innovation in digital learning in Ekiti State. 

 **4.1 Enhanced digital skills and confidence for teachers to use technology in the classroom** 

 DIGISTEM directly trained 25 outreach staff employed by the Ekiti State \[ **E1**\] using DLL research on student engagement, the modified TAM to encourage adoption of technology and the *SpeedyRocket* game. These trainers then worked with teachers to develop their digital skills and increase their confidence in using technology in the classroom. This training empowered the use of digital technology by teachers in the classroom, integrated technology into teaching practice across the state for the first time, and enhanced the overall effectiveness of teaching. As Mr Eweje Olaonipekun, the STEM and Digital Education Officer for Ekiti State, explains: 

 *‘\[t\]he project was a huge success, and it has changed education in our state…The training programmes designed and delivered as part of the DIGISTEM project moved our teachers from novice to people who are confident to use the devices in improving not just teaching and learning but administrative tasks’* \[ **E1**\]. 

 Mr Olaonipekun confirmed that the DIGISTEM training has so far reached a total of 3,745 teachers and more than 10,000 pupils in the state \[ **E1**; **E2**, p16\]. Mr Alufa Adedamola, Programs Manager for the DIGISTEM project, described how practice in the classroom has changed: *‘\[w\]hat DIGISTEM brought was a totally different approach from what has been in operation in our educational ecosystem’* \[ **E3**\]. One teacher characterised the problem teachers faced as a feeling that ‘ *we knew something was missing in our approach to teaching science, we felt there should be more creative ways to teaching these students*’ \[ **E3**\]. Prior to working with DLL and the DIGISTEM project, teachers ‘ *were ready to pass across quality knowledge to the students, but the methods in use were not very effective’* \[ **E3**\]. However, by April 2019 *'65% of the teachers we engage with report a better self\-efficacy to deliver science in the classroom*' \[ **E4**\]. 

 **4.2 Increased enrolment, engagement, and inclusivity in STEM education in public schools** 

 DIGISTEM worked directly with 2,355 young people aged 7\-16 in 50 partner schools in Nigeria to specifically enhance their engagement with science and mathematics subjects through digital gaming \[ **E5**, p3\]. Evaluation performed by the team showed that the revised teaching practice ‘ *resulted in a 30% increase in the number of young people choosing to do science across our partner schools*’ \[ **E4**\]. 

 Partner teachers who had participated in the DLL\-led training reported to Mr Adedamola that ‘ *enrolment in the science class has now increased and that could not be unconnected to the fact that students offering science now find it interesting to learn, you know it's contagious when students discuss how they were taught chemistry*’ \[ **E3**\]. 

 The project also had wider positive impacts on the public school system. Mr Oloanipekun explained that: 

 *\[t\]hree years ago, you wouldn’t believe if someone said ICT education in a public school. Maybe one or two very expensive private schools ... no public school was doing any ICT class. It limited the possibilities for the students in these schools, but the confidence in public school education has increased shown by the increase in the enrolment across the schools where we have introduced ICT education'* \[ **E1**\]. 

 Improvements were also made in terms of addressing gender imbalance in STEM subjects, through training that was based on DLL research findings \[ **R2**, **R5**\]. Mrs Afolalu Oluyemi, Headteacher of the Amazing Group of Schools, explained that the ‘ *sessions around gender stereotypes and the importance of models have supported our teachers in selecting gender\-balanced materials for use in the classroom…\[t\]his in turn has resulted in girls knowing that they can study science and that science is for them*’ \[ **E6**\]. 

 **4.3 Implemented COVID\-19 lockdown digital skills teacher\-training to sustain children’s education** 

 During the COVID\-19 lockdown, training plans were rapidly developed to help teachers to deliver teaching remotely. Mr Adegbola Adesina, Change Management Officer of the Ekiti State Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, worked with Dr Opeyemi Dele\-Ajayi of the DLL to address the challenges they faced, explaining that at the beginning of lockdown they started using state TV and radio for teaching, but this raised problems around learning assessment and feedback, and caused concerns about the quality of delivery \[ **E7**\]. Dr Opeyemi ‘ *designed a training plan leveraging on everyday tools like Google forms, WhatsApp and Telegram, Endnote, etc. to help our teachers reinvent the delivery of teaching and learning activities during the pandemic*’ \[ **E7**\]. As a result of this work ‘ *we have now been able to reach a lot more students during the pandemic, and the teaching is no longer one\-way through the radio and TV, we are now doing assessments, getting feedback on learning from both parents and students using an array of tools and technologies’* \[ **E7**\]. This training has been rolled out to over 5,000 teachers in the state \[ **E7**\]. 

 This intervention was only possible due to DLL's existing involvement in DIGISTEM, and it was based on principles developed and experience gained during the project. The intervention significantly aided student engagement and retention, and improved the ability of Ekiti State to maintain teaching: 

 ‘*We have been able to sustain these efforts and continue to deliver teaching, ensuring we do not lose our students... Our state is one of the few states in Nigeria to maintain daily learning \[during\] this period due to the support we received. We would not have been able to achieve the level and quality of reach we have done and continue to do if not for the new ways of working we embraced as a result of Dr. Opeyemi’s work*’ \[ **E7**\].
