 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The expansion and secure transmission of large\-scale offshore wind energy is likely to require direct current \(DC\) high\-voltage electrical grids. Research undertaken at the University of Aberdeen High Voltage Direct Current \(HVDC\) research centre, led by Professor Jovcic, has demonstrated the advantages of building DC offshore grids using DC/DC converters designed in his research projects. Building on this research, Jovcic has contributed to the development of influential documents via the establishment of working group B4.76 in the International Council on Large Electric Systems \(CIGRE \- a leading organisation, which informs decision\-makers and regulators\). The team’s research has underpinned the implementation of a hardware prototype DC/DC converter for Réseau de Transport d'Électricité \(RTE\) in Europe and shaped the development of a CIGRE DC grid benchmark system, used around the world including in Norway and China.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The International Energy Agency predicts that wind will become Europe’s number one source for power generation by 2027, and European Green Deal estimates that European offshore renewable energy capacity needed by 2050 is 240\-450GW, mostly located 100\-200km from the shore. Existing onshore power networks are based on AC, which can only be used offshore over relatively short distances \(tens of kilometres\).  High voltage Direct Current \(HVDC\) is considered suitable for the transmission of power over long distances, but needs to be substantially further developed to facilitate high\-reliability, meshed, offshore DC grids. The technologies for DC circuit interruption and DC/DC voltage transformation at high powers do not exist, and their perceived costs present a major barrier to uptake by industry. 

 The Aberdeen HVDC research centre has attracted significant external funding to develop high gain, GW\-scale DC/DC converters, which will be one of the building blocks in the development of a multi\-terminal HVDC network in the North Sea. Jovcic has developed new DC/DC converter topologies, which offer benefits in terms of efficiency, reliability, and cost compared to the alternatives. In collaboration with colleagues at McGill University, he evaluated the potential benefits of DC/DC conversion over traditional methods of offshore wind energy integration and found that a DC collection grid using DC/DC converters would allow a substantial reduction in the weight of the cables and magnetic components \[1\]. 

 This research led to a new project, sponsored by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \(EPSRC\), to investigate the feasibility of developing the DC/DC converter technology \[P1\]. The designed converter achieves current regulation even under extreme external DC faults and, therefore, can operate through DC faults \[2\]. In the subsequent EPSRC research project \[P2\], together with 3 Chinese institutions and the University of Strathclyde, Jovcic’s research team evaluated applications in DC grids and developed 30kW prototypes in Aberdeen \[3\] and at the Chinese grid operator site, thereby increasing confidence in the technology. The hardware results have confirmed the technology’s techno\-economic advantages over other DC/DC systems studied worldwide, and removed perceived barriers related to losses and feasibility of DC/DC at high power levels. 

 In parallel to \[P2\], Jovcic was also awarded a starting grant under the FP7 Ideas programme by the European Research Council \[P3\] to develop modelling tools for designing high\-power, multi\-terminal DC grids. Additionally, through this project, the DC/DC concept is expanded towards advanced multi\-port converters \(hub or electronic substation\), resulting in a converter with the ability to operate normally through DC faults on any single port \[4\]. The findings attracted the attention of French company RTE, Europe’s largest grid operator. RTE have an interest in utilising DC grids as the means to connect numerous offshore wind farms in the Mediterranean and the North Sea with the French electricity transmission system. Based on the findings, RTE provided funding for a new project \[P4\], which compared a range of DC transmission options, concluding that the use of DC/DC converters may enhance operating flexibility and power security while keeping costs and power losses competitive \[5\]. 

 With increasing interest from industry, the HVDC Research Centre began an initiative in 2013 to explore the use of modern modular multilevel converter \(MMC\) technologies for building DC hubs. With this aim, a new project was subsequently funded by Scottish grid operator, SSE \(Scottish and Southern Energy\) \[P5\]. Through the SSE\-proposed MMC DC hub test case, the team has shown an acceptable frequency range for onshore and offshore applications, considering detailed loss, weight, and harmonic analysis \[6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Wind energy is expected to be the primary source of electrical energy by 2027, necessitating an increase in the pace of the renewable energy buildout. Considering the expected cost, in excess of GBP100,000,000 per gigawatt \(GW\) DC/DC converter, development of these technologies relies on scaled\-down hardware prototypes, and simulation on full\-power test cases and Benchmark models agreed with all stakeholders. Upscaling of these prototypes requires a long lead time and considerable investment. Research carried out at the University of Aberdeen has yielded important new evidence demonstrating the potential role for DC/DC converters in future offshore DC transmission grids. 

 The acceptance of new technologies is conditional on studies and consensus in international working groups, largely in the CIGRE community. CIGRE is the most influential international professional organisation in the power transmission industry, bringing together global expertise \(manufacturers, grid operators, and developers\) and is the authoritative source of power system technical reference documents. CIGRE activities \(WG meetings, brochures, articles, conferences, green books\) have substantial weight in the professional community in defining best practice, professional methods, in system planning and policy making, while brochures serve as de\-facto standards. 

 **Informing best practice and building confidence in the technology** 

 Within the current REF period, Jovcic was an invited member of and representative of the UK in CIGRE WG \(Working Group\) B4.58, “Control Methodologies for Direct Voltage and Power Flow in a Meshed HVDC Grid” from 2013\-2017. The findings, resulting from Aberdeen research on DC/DC converters were used as technical background for Chapter 5 of brochure 699 \(B4.58\) \[S1\] and were also employed as test cases based on research projects \[P1, P2, P3\] and results in \[1\-5\]. This technical brochure represents an important attempt to provide international consensus on the requirements, classification and description of methodologies for direct voltage control and power flow control in a meshed HVDC grid. The working group affirmed that DC grids are feasible, enabling planning to move to the next stage, including more detailed component and system studies. 

 Jovcic, as WG B4.58 representative, participated in the development of a CIGRE DC grid benchmark test system, supported by two CIGRE working groups \(B4.57 and B4.58\), which is based on topology and parameters agreed by wider industry in CIGRE. In this regard, a DC grid benchmark model can provide a common reference and study platform for researchers to compare the performance and characteristics of different DC control functions and protection strategies \[S2\]. This model has become the primary DC grid test system, providing a common reference platform employed in most EU Horizon2020 research/demonstration projects on DC power transmission grids, allowing researchers to compare the performance and characteristics of a DC grid with different DC control functions and protection strategies. Major operators have used the model including SINTEF, the Norwegian grid operator \[S8i\] and the State Grid Corporation of China, which is the largest utility company in the world \[S8ii\]. EU projects that have used the model to address research challenges include Best Paths \(2014\-2018\), which used the model to analyse the impact of various conditions on the degree of coupling of different subsystems in an interconnected AC/MT\-HVDC system  \( [http://www.bestpaths\-project.eu/](http://www.bestpaths-project.eu/)\) and MEDOW \(Multi\-terminal DC grid for offshore wind; 2013\-2017\) to demonstrate a scaling method, which has potential for further development in order to achieve uniform dynamic responses between experimental test rig and HVDC system. \( [https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/317221](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/317221),  [http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/medow/](http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/medow/)\) \[S9\]. 

 **Establishing and chairing B4.76 CIGRE working group** 

 Jovcic recognised early on that there would be a necessity for DC\-DC converters, which do not currently exist at transmission level, in order to build the safe, flexible and economical offshore DC transmission systems necessary for integration of 100s of GW of offshore energy in projects \[P1\-P5\]. By 2017, the research and development of GW\-scale DC/DC converters had advanced to a point where it was considered technically feasible but coordinated work across the professional community was needed for the acceptance of this new technology. To meet this need, in 2017 Jovcic submitted a proposal to establish a new Working Group on DC/DC converters in the CIGRE B4 study committee, which was approved under the title: B4.76, “DC\-DC converters in HVDC Grids and for connections to HVDC systems” and Prof Jovcic was appointed WG chairman \[S3\]. 

 CIGRE working group B4.76, consisting of 15 members and 5 corresponding members from 7 countries, provided the initial recommendation for high power test DC\-DC converter based on non\-isolated approach. While worldwide manufacturers have their own preferred topology for non\-isolated DC\-DC, commonly IP protected and only some reported in public, the developed test case is vendor\-neutral but represents functionalities and performance acceptable for all vendors \(manufacturers members of B4.76 included ABB, Siemens and Mitsubishi\). In June 2019, Jovcic and members of the B4.76 working group \(including representatives from ABB and Supergrid Institute\) presented a CIGRE paper \[S10\] outlining the topology, test system parameters, performance and models  for the CIGRE DC\-DC test converter. The DC\-DC test case enables DC grid developers to perform studies on a single DC\-DC model, with the understanding that conclusions will be largely valid for DC\-DC supplied by various vendors. The design study in \[S10\] further illustrates CIGRE expert consensus that the non\-isolated DC/DC converter will have an overall semiconductor count comparable to an AC/DC converter of similar rating, which provides the first credible estimates for the system costs, size and weight and therefore reduces concerns relating to cost\-effectiveness. 

 This case study forms a basis of technical work in B4.76, which includes a further isolated DC\-DC test case developed on similar principles. The working group completed work in 2020 and a technical brochure 827 \[S4\] was released in March, 2021. This technical brochure includes a comprehensive survey of all worldwide DC\-DC manufacturers, conducted in 2019 \(5 responses were received\). The responses present manufacturers views on the expected application areas, deployment, functionalities, technologies and readiness level, and these responses are provided in full in the Appendix of the brochure. They give first\-hand information to DC grid developers and planners on the technologies under development. 

 **Influencing decision making and strategic objectives of EU grid operator** 

 As part of their 2017\-2020 R&D programme, RTE indicated that their Research and Development \(R&D\) activities had oriented towards ‘improving performance and securing its technical choices, including increasing the transmission capacity of cables, qualifying new technologies to master their impacts before deploying them on an industrial scale’. Towards meeting these objectives, RTE initiated a project that incorporated the Aberdeen DC/DC converter \[P4\] into a European laboratory DC grid prototype project at École Centrale de Lille, financed and operated by RTE \[S7\]. In 2017, in collaboration with Jovcic and Hajian, Spanish university UPC \(Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, BarcelonaTech\) was contracted by RTE to build the 10\-kW Aberdeen converter under a license agreement. The confirmation of performance and benefits of this demonstrator have been shared in a 2017 publication \[S5\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A protocol \(the *Sheffield Elicitation Framework*: *SHELF*\) was developed for eliciting expert knowledge about uncertain quantities, and representing uncertainty using probability distributions. Guidance and software ensured elicitation methods were accessible to diverse sectors. In parallel, “assurance” methods were developed for using elicitation to improve decision\-making in clinical trial planning. 

 This research has changed practice in three areas. GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis now use the assurance method combined with SHELF when planning clinical trials, to improve productivity by reducing the risk of costly unsuccessful trials. The European Food Safety Authority now uses SHELF to improve risk assessments. The reinsurers Swiss RE now use SHELF to obtain more robust forecasts of life and health risks. 

 SHELF was used to help update the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) guidelines on the use of surgical instruments in managing risks of CJD transmission: a policy decision affecting £13 million of NHS expenditure annually.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In numerous decision\-making and risk analysis problems, values of important quantities of interest are unknown, and suitable data to estimate these values are not available. Expert elicitation enables uncertainty about these quantities to be described using probability distributions, so that decision\-makers can better understand the risks of proposed decision options, and consequently make decisions that are more robust to uncertainty. 

 There are three challenges in expert elicitation. Firstly, experts will typically *not* be experienced in making probability judgements required in most elicitation methods, and may find the process difficult. Secondly, the experts’ judgements are, by definition, subjective, and may be biased; the judgements are not always reliable. Thirdly, different experts will have different opinions, and it is not always clear how to reconcile disagreements between experts. 

 In 2003\-2006, O’Hagan led a team of statisticians and psychologists, funded by the NHS’s Research Methodology Programme, researching best practice in expert elicitation. The team's research **\[R1\]** included the most comprehensive survey of elicitation methodology at the time and was unique in drawing together perspectives from the fields of statistics and psychology. This multidisciplinary approach enabled different elicitation methods to be evaluated in terms of their feasibility and risk of bias, given the findings from the psychology literature. 

 This research **\[R1\]** underpinned the development of ‘SHELF’: the Sheffield Elicitation Framework \(also known as ‘the Sheffield Method’\), designed by O’Hagan and Oakley. SHELF includes a new protocol for eliciting a single distribution from a group of experts, supporting software, training materials, and templates for reporting the results. 

 In addition to research on SHELF, methodology was developed to assist the planning of phase III randomised clinical trials **\[R2, R3, R4\]**. The standard practice in the pharmaceutical industry is to use ‘power’ calculations, where the number of patients to be recruited to a trial is chosen to achieve a desired probability of the trial producing a successful outcome. Critically, the effectiveness of the new drug to be tested is assumed to be its *desired* effectiveness. This can give the impression, sometimes misleading, that a successful trial can be ‘guaranteed’, as long as sufficiently many patients are recruited. 

 An alternative to a power calculation is the ‘assurance’ method: expert uncertainty about the performance of the drug is elicited, allowing a more realistic assessment of the probability of success if taken forward to phase IIl. Assurance methods for a range of different types of clinical trial data were developed at Sheffield **\[R2, R3, R4\]**.  The key step in implementing the assurance method is the elicitation of the probability distribution for the effectiveness of the drug, and this is where the elicitation methodology of SHELF can be brought to bear. Uptake of assurance in the pharmaceutical industry depends on the availability and ease\-of\-use of suitable elicitation methods; for impact, it was necessary to research assurance and elicitation methods in parallel.

 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\): updated guidance on reducing the risk of transmission of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease \(CJD\) from surgery 

 In 2020 NICE issued updated guidance **\[S3\]** on surgical procedures considered at risk of transmitting CJD. The guidance was based on a decision\-modelling exercise **\[S4\]**, in which elicitation with SHELF was essential to quantify uncertainty in the model predictions. The decision\-modelling showed that a precautionary approach of switching to single\-use instruments would not be cost\-effective, even accounting for the uncertainty quantified by SHELF. Based on the annual number of operations and the costs of single\-use surgical instruments, the cost of implementing this precautionary approach in England was estimated to be approximately £13 million every year; such costs would have had significant implications for patients elsewhere in the healthcare system **\[S4\]**. 

 European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\): changing the use of expert knowledge in food safety risk assessments 

 In 2012, SHELF was one of three methods recommended by EFSA’s new guidance on best practice in expert elicitation. In 2015, 50 EFSA staff and 17 EFSA experts were trained in the use of SHELF **\[S5\]**. EFSA have since used SHELF for elicitation in risk assessments in areas to provide quantitative data where qualitative was only possible before, \[Text removed for publication\] **\[S6\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Lifespan has increased, but older adults are spending more time, proportionally, in poor health. Many older adults also suffer from memory problems that can lead to depression and anxiety. Owing to the **A**ston **R**esearch **C**entre for **H**ealth **A**geing established status, and Brown’s burgeoning personal reputation in biogerontology, Brown \(ARCHA’s director\) was invited to design and analyse the scientific experiments that underpinned two Channel 4 series of “Old People’s Home for 4 Year Olds”. Those programmes and Brown’s subsequent involvement with multiple stakeholders have led to improvements in national attitude, commercial reputation and individuals’ quality of life. 

 Impacts on **Health & Wellbeing**, **Culture** and **Commerce** are claimed. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background:** Human lifespan continues to increase in the UK, but the number of years spent in poor health is increasing yet more quickly \(Office for National Statistics, 2016\-2018\); a challenge to individuals, their families, healthcare systems and society. Functional decline associated with the ageing process is a significant cause of morbidity \(disease/other medical conditions\) and mortality. In many older adults, later years are spent in frailty and/or cognitive decline. These age\-related states of vulnerability are associated with increased risk of falls, disability, mental or physical illness and hospitalisation. Indeed, estimates suggest that 17.4% of the global population is frail and 49.3% ‘prefrail’. Many older adults also suffer from over\-general memory – a condition associated with both depression and anxiety. 

 In 2009, Griffiths founded the Aston Research Centre for Healthy Ageing \(ARCHA\) as an interdisciplinary centre of excellence involving biologists, psychologists, pharmacists, opthalmologists and engineers, to engage holistically in all aspects of ageing research with the over\-arching aim of achieving research contributions to good health in older adults. 

 **Underpinning Research:** Within ARCHA, from their respective backgrounds in metabolic disorders, psychology and redox biology, Brown, Holland and Griffiths have together created a body of knowledge involving the metabolism associated with ageing, the link between physical activity and biomarkers of ageing, simple interventions to reduce hospital re\-admission post\-discharge by the NHS and the assessment/therapy of frailty and cognitive decline in older adults. 

 **Research Insights/Findings:** Frailty is not inevitable or irreversible and has many means of detection. ARCHA research identified that a biological marker of frailty \(telomere length\) is influenced by irisin, an exercise hormone in healthy subjects \( **S3.1**\), whilst fats in the blood associated with diet and exercise can predict ageing in healthy individuals \( **S3.2**\). Particularly pertinent to the current pandemic, Brown, Griffiths and colleagues reviewed the role that metabolic programming and loss of redox homeostasis play during ageing in the decline of T cell function, which is thought to contribute to reduced response to infection and vaccination \( **S3.3**\). On the psychological front, Brown and colleagues determined that a simple phone call from a community nurse with potential to follow\-up via primary care where needed, reduced re\-admission to hospital of over\-65\-year\-olds by more than 40% \( **S3.4**\), whilst Holland and colleagues demonstrated that both Memory Specific Training \(MEST\) and life review could help to restore autobiographical memory, so reducing over\-general memory and alleviating symptoms of both depression and anxiety \( **S3.5**\). Via systematic review, they also determined the absolute necessity of patient and carer inclusion in identification of needs and interventions to reduce refusal of key services \( **S3.6**\). 

 **ARCHA Roles:** Prof Helen Griffiths founded ARCHA in 2009. Dr Carol Holland became ARCHA director in 2016. Dr James Brown was ARCHA’s first\-appointed postdoctoral researcher, was promoted to Lecturer, Senior Lecturer and Associate Professor in 2013, 2016 and 2018 respectively and was appointed director of ARCHA in 2018.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Context:** ARCHA’s research\-based interaction with care homes started when Holland studied the effect on older adults of moving into an Extracare Charitable Trust retirement community. By 2015, she had demonstrated that Extracare’s approach of integrated housing, care and support led to quantifiable reductions in NHS/social care costs at 12 months, plus a 10.1% improvement in residents’ autobiographical memory and accompanying 14.8% reduction in depressive symptoms at 18 months \( **S5.1**\). Meanwhile, in 2017, TV company CPL productions Ltd. \(CPL\) chose to create a TV series examining the benefits of intergenerational care \(regular interaction between nursery children and care\-home residents\). Importantly, CPL wished to substantiate their episodes with scientific evidence, rather than relying simply on anecdote. 

 Brown’s established research expertise in biogerontology \( **S3.1\-S3.3**\), wellbeing in older adults \( **S3.4**\) and ARCHA’s past experience with care homes \( **S5.1**\) led CPL productions Ltd. to select Brown, as director of ARCHA, to design the series’ scientific underpinning tests \(a package of physiological and cognitive analyses\) to quantify the effects of intergenerational activities on older adult volunteers \( **S5.2**\). Brown was teamed with clinicians experienced in intergenerational activities and an early\-years expert, to conduct the study for Channel 4. Series 1 \(2 episodes\) was followed by a second series \(5 episodes\) based in the same Extracare village that Holland had studied previously.  Brown consulted in both series, analysed the data, featured on\-screen in series 2 and importantly, continued his research/engagement with participants after Series 2 completion. Brown’s work with CPL, the resulting broadcast of Old People’s Home for 4 Year Olds \(OPHF4YO\) and Brown’s follow\-up interactions with participants have led to: 

####  Impact on Health and Wellbeing 1 \- demonstrable improvements for older adults: 

 In series 2, Brown recorded statistically\-significant improvements in balance, walking speed, grip strength, mood, overall cognitive function and episodic memory in older adult volunteers. His follow\-up research found that these improvements were retained 6 months later and were also accompanied by outstanding improvements in residents’ quality of life \( **S5.3**\). Qualitatively, a resident stated “Personally, I improved in every one \[test\], sometimes spectacularly….I still find that I can converse freely and have lost the fear of starting up dialogues” \(this resident had described himself previously as “almost a hermit” **S5.3**\). 

 Importantly, this impact was not limited to the care home/nursery featured in the TV series. The owner of Berrington Lodge Nursery \(opened Sept\-2018\) wrote to Brown in December 2018, to say that OPHF4YO had inspired her to undertake similar intergenerational activities with a neighbouring care home \( **S5.4**\). Her recent update revealed that by mid\-2019, their intergenerational activity had “grown from strength to strength” *.* Describing multiple indoor and outdoor co\-activities, she also described the two\-way curiosity between generations and quoted a care home resident who stated “ **This has switched my brain back on, I now have something to look forward \[to\] and think about**”. With interactions currently curtailed to remote activities, the manager states: “We can’t wait for the time when we can visit the residents once more” \( **S5.4**\) *.* 

####  Impact on Health and Wellbeing 2 \- demonstrable improvements for nursery children: 

 Brown also worked closely with the early years expert who confirmed accompanying improvements in the children’s behaviour, both quantitatively from test data and qualitatively from parents’ observations. These confirmed that most children in OPHF4YO had improved confidence, language development, independence, imagination, maturity, empathy and concentration \( **S5.5**\). Qualitatively, a parent cites Brown’s continued \(post\-series\) engagement and states numerous benefits to her son, including “It has opened up \[son’s\] circle of friends. He refers to his favourite of the older adults … when listing his friends – right alongside his 5\-year\-old friends from school. In his eyes there is no difference” \( **S5.5**\). This change in perspective is again supported by Berrington Lodge’s manager who states “The strong bond we have with \[care home\] has reinforced their \[children’s\] respect for the elderly” **\(S5.4\)** *.* 

####  Impact on Culture and Society \- the OPHF4YO legacy: 

 Numerous other UK care homes and nurseries cite OPHF4YO as their inspiration for commencing intergenerational activities \( **S5.6**\) whilst the Secretary of State for Health, the Rt Hon. Matt Hancock MP called for “intergenerational care to become routine” \( **S5.7**\). Intent has been followed by investment. United for All Ages \(UAA\) state “intergenerational activities have exploded due to the two series of OPHF4YO”. Working with Millenium Care, UAA are delivering a £12m intergenerational development program \( **S5.8**\). Meanwhile, OPHF4YO inspired ParkDean Resorts to commission research into intergenerational benefit and consequently, Brown consulted in developing the ‘Great Grandparent Getaway’ campaign. Despite the pandemic, ParkDean have now launched the UK’s first four\-generation holiday package \( **S5.9**\). 

####  Impact on Commerce & Economy \- international reputational & financial gains for CPL Productions Ltd. and Red Seven Entertainment: 

 Series 1 of OPHF4YO reached >2.5 million viewers per episode. Series 2 averaged 1.8 million viewers over 5 episodes, was 4th among human interest documentaries on Channel 4 and was a top\-10 UK trending subject on Twitter in each week of broadcast. Multiple awards and a BAFTA nomination accorded to OPHF4YO benefitted CPL’s reputation, culminating in their nomination for best Independent Production Company at the Broadcast Awards 2019 \( **S5.10**\). This high profile has also led to international sales: the format is now licensed to 15 countries over 3 continents, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and multiple European countries \( **S5.10**\) with associated financial gain.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The on\-going energy frontier programme of the Large Hadron Collider \(LHC\), and the discovery of the Higgs boson in particular, have stimulated interest in physics on a scale unprecedented by any other single experiment. Since 2013, UCL physics researchers who participated in the discovery of the Higgs boson and the ATLAS experiment have contributed to media features, written articles, blog posts, public and school talks, panel discussions and published books on the topic. These efforts have reached millions of audiences worldwide \(including in the UK, US, China, France and Italy\) and have continued to spark interest in physics and improve public understanding of the nature and purpose of scientific research.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The ATLAS detector, one of two general\-purpose particle detectors at the CERN LHC, aims to understand electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of mass; in the Standard Model the Higgs boson is responsible for these phenomena. The LHC began physics operation in late 2009, and on 4 July 2012 the ATLAS collaboration announced the discovery of a new particle, since shown to be a Higgs boson and consistent with the Standard Model \( **R1**\). As a result, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to the theorists, Englert and Higgs, in 2013. 

 The High Energy Physics \(HEP\) group, part of UCL’s Department of Physics & Astronomy, played a major role in the discovery of the Higgs boson. HEP researchers were involved in constructing ATLAS’s detector \( **R2**\). They built electronics for the data acquisition and trigger systems; wrote simulation, trigger and visualisation code for the experiment; and worked on the mechanical engineering of the Semiconductor Tracker \(an essential component of the detector\), including cable layout and thermal properties. Other major UCL research outputs contributing directly to the impact included the measurement of several key processes for the first time at the unprecedented LHC energies, including “minimum bias” collisions, high energy jet production and the production of electroweak bosons, \(for example \( **R3**\). As conveners of the ATLAS Standard Model group, several ATLAS subgroups, and lead authors on papers, developed a new way of finding Higgs bosons using the boost and jet substructure, overcoming the challenges of high backgrounds and high particle densities in this key channel \( **R4**\). This has since been essential to the observation of high momentum Higgs production \( **R5**\) and played a role in the first observation of the Higgs in the decay channel to bottom quarks \( **R6**\), all of which were UCL\-led publications. UCL also made major contributions to work on jet calibration and event simulation \(leading the subgroups responsible\), and aspects of the discovery analysis, including simulation. 

 Key UCL researchers responsible for this research were Jonathan Butterworth \(Professor, ATLAS UK PI 2007\-2009, ATLAS Standard Model Convener 2010\-2012\), Emily Nurse \(Lecturer and RS URF, convener of soft QCD subgroup 2010\), Mario Campanelli \(Lecturer, jet subgroup convener 2011\), Nikos Konstantinidis \(Professor, ATLAS UK PI 2016\-2019\), Tim  Scanlon \(Lecturer and Royal Society URF, leader of Higgs to bb analysis group\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 There is a clear appetite from the public for accessible information about cutting\-edge physics, which helps inform and raise the quality of public discourse around science and research in general; this is perhaps more obviously crucial now than ever before given the challenges we face. UCL contributions to the physics programme of the CERN Large Hadron Collider and related public engagement activities have both met and further stimulated this appetite. This research addresses fundamental questions about the nature of the universe via experiments, deploying advanced technology and engineering. It has led to improved understanding of particle physics concepts and, more widely, of the nature of scientific evidence among the public and pupils, which has changed attitudes, influenced public discourse, and encouraged uptake of opportunities in STEM, as evidenced below. 

 <ins> **Increased</ins> <ins>public understanding of particle physics through blog, books and media activity**</ins> 

 Professor Butterworth’s *Life & Physics* blog began as a record of the research behind the Higgs boson discovery in an effort to present science and discoveries in a more accessible way. The blog was hosted by *The Guardian* website between August 2010 and August 2018. Subsequently, the blog moved onto Wordpress with associated articles on the Cosmic Shambles network, a platform for people who want to find out more about our universe through science, art, history, philosophy, music and literature. From August 2013 to December 2020, *Life & Physics* posts discussing UCL research have been published weekly attracting 3,700,000 unique visitors \(with peaks of approximately 20,000 per day\) from many countries, including the UK, USA, Germany, France and Australia \( **S1**\). 

 Readers acknowledged the value of the research on particle physics discussed on the blog and the technological advancement it led to: “The physics is important from a fundamental understanding of the nature of matter in our universe and the technological advances have been monumental in the collider and detectors structure”, one comment read, “It's knowledge for the sake of knowing things. I think that's worthwhile. In some ways it's what makes us human” \( **S2**\). Although the benefits of fundamental research on particle physics are not immediate, these blog posts improved readers’ understanding of particle physics and its potential: “Learning how to manipulate the Higgs field may also bring about technologies we can't even dream of today,” read one comment, while another said, “Explain why we need to prove Higgs boson exists as at all, why not just believe the theory and move on and start to take advantage of whatever it can be used for? If it has some uses, let’s start applying the science to develop the uses” \( **S2**\). Furthermore, UCL’s research described in the *Life & Physics* blog provided a resource for physics teachers to engage students with STEM subjects and led to changes in teaching practice. A secondary school teacher commented: “These posts \[on the *Life & Physics* blog\] were not only the perfect source for being up to date with new discoveries in particle physics, but also an inspiration and a great resource for teaching physics. Indeed, I have used Professor Butterworth’s articles during physics classes on many occasions” \( **S3**\). 

 Butterworth’s other public engagements with broadcast media in response to public interest included television and radio appearances where he discussed his underpinning research. These include Infinite Monkey Cage \(BBC4; 04/07/2017\), Today Programme \(04/01/2017, 16/01/2018, 27/03/2019\), BBC Inside Science \(03/09/2015, 29/04/2016, 17/05/2018, 21/06/2018, 28/06/2018\). Each episode of Infinite Monkey Cage featuring Butterworth gathered approximately 2,000,000 listeners and 400,000 podcast downloads \( **S4**\). 

 The large readership of the blog and the positive feedback evidenced a clear public interest in physics. Consequently, Butterworth wrote two books – *Smashing Physics* \(published on 7<sup>th</sup> May 2015\) and *A Map of the Invisible* \(published on 6<sup>th</sup> September 2018\) – that provided a systematic explanation of his research in particle physics to the public in an accessible way. *Smashing Physics* and *A Map of The Invisible* have been published in the UK, the US, China, Germany, Taiwan, France, Italy and Russia, with over 36,800 copies and 22,000 copies respectively sold \( **S5**\). The Royal Society acknowledged *Smashing Physics* for making *“*the most advanced science around seem within our grasp” and shortlisted it for the Winton Prize \( **S6**\). Reviews of *A Map of the Invisible* evidence improved understanding of particle physics concepts by its readers: “It \[ *A Map of the Invisible*\] has lots of information regarding particle physics put in a way that's easy to understand for anyone who is new to the field”, and “I've been teaching myself about the quantum world for two years and the analogies used in this book provided more than a handful of a\-ha moments” \( **S7**\). 

 Additionally, in response to demands from schools internationally for accessible content on physics research, ATLAS and TED created the animation lecture *What’s the smallest thing in the universe,* detailing Higgs research conducted at UCL and ATLAS *.* Between its publication on 18<sup>th</sup> November 2018 and 15<sup>th</sup> November 2020, the video reached a viewership of approximately 678,000 and received 904 comments. The animation increased viewers’ understanding of matter and fundamental particles and inspired them to learn more about the subject as evidenced by viewers’ comments: “I've always wondered what the particles that are smaller than subatomic particles were. I also really love how you can explain complex concepts in a really simple way that people can understand and that can be easily accessed,” one said. Another noted, “I have known about the elementary particles for years but this quick video just gave me more info about the interactions of the particles then I ever knew. Now it's time for more advanced vids” \( **S8**\). 

 <ins> **Inspiring</ins> <ins>public and</ins> <ins>school children</ins> <ins></ins><ins>through talks about</ins> <ins>particle physics**</ins> 

 Approximately 15,000 people attended talks at which Butterworth and his team discussed the Higgs and related research, including Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless/Curious People \(2017 and 2018\), End of the World Show \(2017\), New Scientist Live \(2018\), British Science Festival \(2018\), and Royal Institution public lecture \(2018\). Butterworth also took part in *Sceptics in the Pub* events between 2014 and 2019 \(9 events; 40\-50 participants each\), where the audience engaged in discussion of his research on the Higgs boson. The organisers for New Scientist Live \(2018\) highlighted the contribution from Butterworth to the event: “We had 40,000 attendees this year... and the Cosmos stage had 10,595 attendees over the course of the event\! \[…\] It was incredible to observe the festival come to life and watch visitors engage so fully with all the talks and exhibits. We want to thank you for taking the time to prepare and present a talk that was both engaging and informative” \( **S9**\). 

 Members of the UCL High Energy Physics group, including Professor Butterworth and his team, delivered at least 20 ATLAS\-related school talks since January 2015, reaching approximately 1,200 Year 9\-13 students in total. Students were interested and engaged in lectures that covered particle physics and aspects of researchers’ work as evidenced by a teacher’s testimonial: “Approximately 50 of them \[students\] from year 9\-13 attended the lecture that covered not only principles of physics and insights about the ATLAS experiments, but also aspects of the day\-to\-day life of a researcher. Students were very interested and engaged in the lecture as evidenced by a lively question session after the lecture and a positive feedback. This was an excellent preparation for our trip to LHC and an inspiration for our students. Out of the students in year 12 and 13 during that academic year \(2015\), 4 of them decided to read physics and 9 chose engineering at university” \( **S3**\). Another teacher confirmed that students found “the lecture of the professor as very informative and that \[the lecture\] had given them a better understanding of the particle word” \( **S10**\). Such engagement effort has contributed to an 66% upsurge of applications to UCL undergraduate Physics courses from the schools that Butterworth and his team have given talks to between 2012/2013 and 2019/2020.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Andrew Rogers’ research addresses the belief and practice of Black Majority Churches \(BMCs\) in the UK. The growth of BMCs has not been matched by a corresponding awareness in UK public institutions of their needs, contributions and concerns. Rogers’ research has directly addressed the implications of this awareness deficit through investigating BMC spatial needs and engaging directly with faith groups, government and planning professionals to create new networks and find innovative ways to involve religious minorities in public planning by: 

1.  informing policy and shaping the practice of government in London and Scotland, of planning professionals across Europe, and of new research projects being undertaken by religious policy institutes; and 

1.  inspiring the creative practice and commission of two exhibitions at the Tate Modern 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Rogers has undertaken research into the spatial engagement of BMCs in London through three funded research projects. The public practical theology project, *Being Built Together* \( **G1**\) analysed how 38 BMCs in the London Borough of Southwark engaged with the planning policy and practice of local government, as well as offering accounts of their demographics and ecclesiology. The project’s original aim was to generate an account of new black congregations in Southwark, with regard to demographics and ecclesiology. The resultant report provided a snapshot of the wide variety and huge number of churches that are being built in Southwark, and how issues of availability and provision of buildings for prayer, worship and community service proved challenging for these groups, causing them to repurpose old structures and often put them to multipurpose use. Key findings included the recognition of Southwark as having the highest concentration of diaspora African congregations in the world at the time, and the influence of the planning system on BMC ecclesiology along with 16 corresponding recommendations for revised policy and practice to redress the lack of positive planning for BMCs by government at all levels, packaged into a report, Being Built Together: Final Report \( **IMP1**\) in 2013. 

 Two further funded projects developed the key research insights of *Being Built Together*, publishing them in rigorous academic fora. The AHRC *Faith and Place network* \( **G2**\) addressed critical issues around UK diaspora faith groups \(including BMCs\), places of worship and the planning system, leading to the publication of a policy briefing with 15 recommendations for planners, policymakers and all faith groups, across England and Wales. The *Religious Meeting Places* project \( **G3**\) had a particular focus on long\-term demographic projections for diaspora faith groups \(including BMCs\) in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, finding that government needs to plan far ahead for their significant spatial needs. 

 Research published by Rogers \( **R1**, **R2**\) built on the findings of *Being Built Together* \( **G1**\), incorporating them into a larger research project. Rogers’ research argues that London has experienced a complex form of desecularisation \( **R1, R2**\) but through examining the demographics and growth of BMCs it contextualises paradoxical Borough\-level BMC growth within the wider London and national context of church decline. Considering BMC growth factors such as ecclesiological distinctiveness, ethnic minority demographics, geographical location and marketplace clustering effect, he argues that the predominant church decline narrative needs to become more nuanced and complex, given the paradoxical and multi\-layered reality on the ground. 

 The influence of the planning system on BMCs is examined in detail in Rogers’ article ‘Lived Theologies of Place: Finding a Home in the City’ \( **R3**\). Drawing on the thinking of Michel de Certeau and the idea of ‘lived theology’, this research demonstrates how the planning system influences BMC beliefs and practices through the interplay of particular strategies and tactics. BMCs’ tactical responses to the scarcity of suitable premises and associated planning constraints have involved significant repurposing of the space that is available, making creative use of the ‘unsuitable’ and thus shaping the churches’ theologies of place. Constraints on ‘noise’ have influenced the style of worship and strategic notions of the local have seen tactical changes to BMC practices of community engagement. Rogers’ research demonstrates that place is a crucial nexus for understanding lived theologies, and that its contestation of place reveals the significance of power\(lessness\) for the same.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

1.  **Informing policy and shaping the practice of government, planning professionals and policy institutes** 

 After Rogers completed the *Being Built Together* project \( **G1**\) he founded and led the *Faith and Place network* \( **G2**\) between 2014 and 2016. The network was established to explore issues at the interface of faith, place and planning for minority faith groups in England and Wales with the specific objective of informing policy through engagement with policymakers at the local, regional and national governmental levels. The network brought together 70 members including 12 faith group representatives, academics from multiple disciplines, planners, policy makers, local and national government representatives and civil society organisations for the first time. As a result of this group’s work, and building on the Being Built Together: Final Report \( **IMP1**\), Rogers co\-authored Faith Groups and the Planning System: A Policy Briefing \( **IMP2**\). This briefing was the basis of engagement with 363 local planning authorities in England and Wales. 

 The policy briefing \( **IMP2**\) informed changes to the public planning documents of local governments, laying the groundwork for material changes to planning for religious groups. For example, Barking and Dagenham Council commissioned a study of future religious spatial needs in the borough to 2050 \(funded by **G3**\) which incorporated Rogers’ recommendation for the provision of facilities suitable for use by faith groups. This study, informed by Rogers’ research, is now included in the Council’s evidence base to support the development of the Local Plan \( **IMP3**\). The Scottish government cited the briefing \( **IMP2**\) in the ‘Religion and Belief’ section of the Equality Impact Assessment on the Planning \(Scotland\) Bill, describing the document as ‘the main evidence of the planning issues under this characteristic’ \( **IMP4**\). 

 Rogers’ briefing document \( **IMP2**\) has also been taken up by the Royal Town Planning Institute \(RTPI\), the UK’s leading planning body for spatial, sustainable and inclusive planning, with over 23,000 members, which cited the briefing in evidence to a Department of Communities and Local Government Select Committee on issues relating to ‘the protection afforded institutional land use currently as a means for helping faith groups’. The RTPI’s evidence concluded that ‘numerous faith groups can be in cities and… the need to cater for new groups emerging is essential’ \( **IMP5**\) and the RTPI’s Head of Policy Practice further testified to the awareness of new ways of working raised by Rogers’ briefing, including the necessity of engaging directly with faith communities ‘to put our needs as professionals’ to them. Rogers’ research is already influencing the work that RTPI members currently do ‘with partners on the future of the high street and town centres. It is increasingly clear that town centres need to diversify from retail use and faith use would be a very suitable one… mean\[ing\] that faith uses are increasingly suitably located in places easy to reach by sustainable modes of transport’ \( **IMP6**\). 

 Rogers’ research has provided an example to other projects by policy institutes, which have subsequently undertaken research into the relationship between faith groups and public planning professionals. For example, Theos, a think tank which aims to reframe discussions about faith groups in the public eye, published a report on Religious London that acknowledged Rogers’ research as an inspiration for the project. As they observe, ‘In 2019, this work was a key resource for our research project ‘Religious London’ \( [https://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/research/2019/02/19/religious\-london](https://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/research/2019/02/19/religious-london)\).’ In particular, Theos attribute Rogers’ research with their greater awareness of ‘the multiplication of diaspora congregations in particular areas’ and ‘issues around building use… and the urgent need for attention from public authorities to the need for more worshipping spaces in light of demographic trends’. Based on this greater awareness, the researchers opted to further explore these themes through a set of interviews in area\-based case studies, causing them to highlight the need for the development of community infrastructure, including worshipping space, in their report. The report was publicised in major news media outlets, including *The Guardian*, *The Independent* and *The Times* \( **IMP7**\). 

1.  **Inspiring cultural organisations and creative practice** 

 Rogers’ report \( **G1**\) inspired Tate Modern to commission a publication and photographic exhibition about BMCs in Southwark in 2014. As Rogers found, in 2014 there were more than 240 BMCs in Southwark, all acting not just as spaces of faith, but also as sources of advice on health, relationships, and law and order. The Tate Modern Curator who commissioned the exhibition commented, ‘Both Chloe Dewe Mathews, the artist we had commissioned, and I had read “Being Built Together” \[ **IMP1**\] and were very inspired to learn of the findings and information that has been gathered as part of the report \- in particular we were inspired by your findings about the volume of new black majority churches in Southwark’ \( **IMP8**\). In response to this finding, a photographic artist explored these new forms of church life and the reinvention of former industrial spaces in an exhibition commissioned by Tate Modern called ‘Sunday Service’, which ran free of charge from 28 May to 13 July 2014 and was attended by 2,000 members of the public. The research also provided ‘a launching point’ for the 2014 edition of *Tate Modern and You*, a publication that is regularly produced in partnership with a neighbourhood or section of the local community, in collaboration with an artist, aiming to make stronger links with different communities across Southwark and Lambeth boroughs. 1,000 copies of the 2014 edition were circulated. Following the success of ‘Sunday Service’, the exhibition was subsequently followed up by a video installation called ‘Congregation’ at Bosse & Baum, an art gallery in Peckham, which ran from 29 May to 21 June 2015 and attended by 500 members of the public. Rogers’ research was cited as an inspiration for the research on both exhibition webpages \( **IMP9**\). The photographic artist further observed that Rogers’ research ‘gave me a framework to consider and, through my art, document how the spaces in which these Black Majority Churches are not just places of worship, but also sites at which health, relationship and legal advice are ordered’ \( **IMP10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research on gender, conflict and governance by Gizelis and Kern has transformed women’s livelihoods in difficult contexts in fragile states, informing and influencing national policymakers, local peacebuilders and international organisations. This work has provided a sound evidence base for changes to programmes of eminent government agencies working on peace and gender. By offering robust insights the research shaped high\-level policy circles and debates, including the UN Secretary\-General’s High\-Level Panel on Peace Operations and the High\-Level Advisory Group of the Global Study on UNSCR 1325. Additionally, it has strengthened women’s land rights activism and female\-headed households’ well\-being and empowerment by improving the Uganda Land Alliance’s programs through improved governance; deepening engagement with its 300 land rights advocates and training of an additional 150 advocates; widening the ULA’s reach across 36 parishes, involving 1,300 marginalised households to foster gender equality. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research program on women in fragile states conducted by Gizelis and Kern provides actionable evidence in support of UN Sustainable Development Goals *5: Gender Equality* and *16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions*. Using a wide range of research methods, the research programme provides synergistic insights into how women’s livelihoods can be improved in fragile states, where producing robust insights is extraordinarily challenging. Gizelis’ work has focused on the systematic study of gender, peace and conflict. Kern investigates challenges of coexisting state and customary institutions, and how women’s rights fare under such dualism. 

 Gizelis’ research on the links between gender equality and peace was first referenced in the Human Conflict Special Section of *Science* \(18 May 2012 Vol 336\). Conducting research in Liberia in 2011/2015, Gizelis demonstrated that the contributions of civil society and women’s organisations in post\-conflict peacebuilding should be understood primarily in terms of social networks and connections emerging in peacebuilding processes \[R1, R2\]. More recent research on *Armed Conflict and Maternal Health in Sub\-Saharan Africa* extended Gizelis’ research to demonstrate the opportunity to investigate the importance of horizontal social networks and inclusionary policies in other areas of development including maternal health during major crises like Ebola in West Africa \[R3\]. Gizelis’ research shows that inclusionary policies promoting development and poverty reduction work best if gender and development are pursued in terms of national policies aiming at structural changes such as national budgeting processes and inclusion of horizontal networks \[R4, R2\]. Gizelis has shown that in post\-conflict environments women and girls are particularly vulnerable to the disruption of access to public services due to structural inequalities, especially those from marginalised communities \[R1, R4\]. 

 Kern, Holzinger and Kromrey \[R5\] show that in regions such as Sub\-Saharan Africa the constitutional integration of customary authorities has increased since 1990. While traditional authorities – such as chiefs or elders – are frequently perceived as negatively influencing progressive norms in societies \(e.g., gender rights\), Goist and Kern \[R6\] also show that traditional institutions can increase cooperation in communities. However, Kern \[R7\] also demonstrates that the divergence of the preferred versus the actual influence of traditional leaders bears potential for social conflict. Based on existing research by Kern and others one proposition posits that the less integrated state and traditional land rights are, the greater the uncertainty in terms of property rights. Moreover, customary institutions are often dominated by men, which may be particularly problematic for women seeking land ownership. This observation led to the collaboration between the Uganda Land Alliance and Kern \(PI\) \[with Dietrich and Winters\] to jointly clarify how women’s land rights can be improved \(on\-going project\). Kern partnered with the Uganda Land Alliance, a local NGO advocating women’s rights, to investigate the effectiveness of the ULA’s women’s land advocates program.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research by Gizelis and Kern on gender, conflict and governance has provided the evidence base informing discourses and policies of international organisations, and also directly empowered individual women and their organisations by means of improving local institutions and governance mechanisms. 

 **Providing the evidence base informing policies and practices** 

 Professor Gizelis’ research on gender and conflict and conflict resolution has contributed to programmatic changes of a number of organisations internationally. Through both strengthening the evidence base, and increasing the accessibility of research, Gizelis’ work impacts upon practitioners, NGOs and governmental organisations. 

 Professor Gizelis has a long\-standing collaboration with the Folke Bernadotte Academy \(FBA\), a Swedish Government agency for peace, security and development \[S1\] and is an active member of the FBA working group focusing on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 \(since 2010\). FBA Head of Research confirms that Gizelis’ research \[R1, R2, R3\], 

 “*has been of particular relevance to FBA’s work thematically as well as practically as part of the agency’s efforts to increase the evidence\-based approach in its work*, \[…\] *it informs and strengthens our technical advice that we give to key partners and national stakeholders”* \[S1\]. 

 The Head of Research adds: “ *Gizelis’s research on gender in conflict\-affected countries has also* *contributed to the work of FBA’s own programme which focuses on Women, Peace and Security”* \[S1\]. In 2018 the FBA invited Gizelis to participate in the ‘FBA Research Workshop and Research Policy\-Dialogue on Sustainable Peace’ in Liberia, involving representatives from the Liberian Armed Forces, the Ministry of Justice, Independent National Human Rights Commission, Liberia Institute for Public Administration, and UN Agencies \[S2\]. The Head of Research at FBA states that 

 *“By engaging in the Research\-Policy dialogue, Gizelis contributed to FBA’s work of making research findings accessible amongst practitioners that work directly with the issues at hand as well as contributed to the work that FBA does as part of the Swedish government’s bilateral cooperation in Liberia*” \[S1\]. 

 Gizelis research led to her invitation as academic advisor to the Myanmar Institute of Gender Studies \(MIGS\) supported by the Canadian donor International Development Research Centre \(IDRC\) \[S3\]. The MIGS project has raised awareness in the upper and lower houses and specific committees within sub\-national parliaments across Myanmar of the need to incorporate gender considerations into public budgets, which are helping to shape a new perspective in policymaking. Gizelis’ research \[R3\] was used in the development of a survey to find out about citizens’ budget preferences in Myanmar \(2018\) to explore gender budgeting as a structural strategy for poverty reduction. As the IDRC Senior Program Specialist in Myanmar states: 

 “*…the survey results have generated discussions at the different government levels in Myanmar in 2020\-21 about how the inclusion of gender considerations when preparing and discussing public allocation of funds addresses a basic cornerstone of democratic development”* continuing that *'the research efforts have contributed to improving gender equality...within Myanmar's public budgeting process*.” \[S3\]. 

 Gizelis delivered training to 20 practitioners from MIGS, the Myanmar Department of Social Welfare, and Myanmar Central Statistical Organization in 2018 on the relevance of budgetary decisions on policy outcomes affecting men and women, which enabled participants to apply their training to other audiences and policy issues \[S3a\]. 

 Gizelis and Kern’s research has led to engagement with international policymakers, challenging existing policies and providing research evidence\-based support for policy improvement with regard to women’s livelihoods in fragile states. At a joint workshop in December 2019 with the High Commission of Uganda to the United Kingdom – attended by participants from the Overseas Development Institute, Amnesty International, the UK Cabinet Office – the Ugandan Ambassador emphasised: 

 “*the important research work undertaken on women empowerment and improving women’s livelihoods, including through the land rights advocacy”* \[S4\]. 

 Gizelis’ research \[R1\-4\] has provided the evidence base on gender in fragile and post\-conflict states. She has been invited to offer insights at high\-level events where her research has informed influential practitioners and policymakers. Participants included members of the UN Secretary\-General’s High\-Level Panel on Peace Operations and the High\-Level Advisory Group of the Global Study on UNSCR 1325 \[S5\], Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs \[S6\], the Canadian Elsie Initiative for Women in Peace \[S7\], Stockholm International Peace Research Institute \(SIPRI\) \[S6\] and the Swedish Minister for International Development Cooperation \[S8\]. The importance of Gizelis’ research was highlighted by the HE Swedish Ambassador to UN in 2015, who attested to \[R3\] being an: 

 “*extremely important contribution \[to\] enhancing our understanding of women, peace and security”* \[S9\]. 

 **Ensuring the rights of women in Northern Uganda** 

 As well as having an impact on policy and practice, through working with women in Uganda, Kern’s research has changed how women access their rights. Women in Uganda continue to be denied land and property rights due to traditional practices despite legal recognition. Kern has collaborated with the Uganda Land Alliance \(ULA\) an NGO **to strengthen its policy and practices**. The ULA, a consortium of over 60 international, national and local civil society organizations working to ensure equitable land distribution, educates local female and male advocates about women’s land rights. These advocates go on to assist marginalized households in their communities in relation to access, control and ownership over land. Drawing on Kern’s research \[R5, R6\], the ULA changed the way it engages with its 300 existing female advocates and improved the training delivered by ULA staff to a further 150 additional advocates, using a new training manual \[S10\] developed based on evidence collected via a survey of 118 land rights advocates and focus groups with 24 advocates. As a result, the ULA have improved their governance processes, enhanced their capacity and widened their reach on the ground, with advocates operating in a further two districts and 36 parishes \[S11 pg 2\]. Freda Oroki, a ULA trainer working directly with the advocates, confirms that the project has changed the ULA’s overall approach: 

 “*As a result of this project we have revitalized our women land rights advocates previously trained in 2010. \[…\] Because of this process we are now in constant contact with them and this has given us an opportunity to offer technical support to them in case of any challenges they are facing. It has made them do their work better and they are now more vibrant...”* \[S12\]. 

 On the project the ULA Executive Director confirms: 

 “*The ULA sensitized communities to ensure that the Communal Land Associations \(CLA\) were constituted properly and that they understood and knew their roles and the rights of the members of their CLAs*.” \[S12a\]. 

 The application of Kern’s research has **empowered women to assert their land rights in Northern Uganda**. The training delivered to the advocates led to a greater understanding amongst the women about their land rights, improving their confidence and empowering them to assert their rights: 

 “*In the short term, the training has created awareness of women’s rights to land access, control and ownership. For female\-headed households, some of the women now have the confidence to tackle challenges they have faced in their rights to their late husband’s land and property”* \[S11\]. 

 This improved awareness is further evidenced by testimonials from the 150 women participating in the training: 

 “*I am a widow. Some people were trying to take my land. But now I know my right and am confident to go and claim and assert my right over my deceased husband’s land.”* \(Participating woman 1\) \[S11\]. *“\[N\]ow I know that as a legally married wife, I still have right to that property, and I will claim my right.”* \(Participating woman 2\) \[S11\]. 

 The introduction of action plans at the parish level to educate communities on property rights \[S11, pg 6\] affords the women in these communities greater gender equality and financial security as evidenced by their testimonies: 

 “*But now I see that the government says I have rights”*, “ *I will go back and teach my fellow women who have also been struggling with this issue”* \[S11\]. 

 “*I learnt that women have a right to equal share of family property*“, “ *I was not aware that as a \(girl\) child am entitled to my father’s estate. But now if there is any issue, I will ensure to participate and to protect my rights*” \[S11\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Modood’s research has significantly raised awareness of, and shaped, public and political debate around: public religious identities and multiculturalism; the definition and implications of Islamophobia; and the necessity of a new ethos of national identity regarding the integration of minority groups, not least British Muslims. Modood’s research has been highly influential at the macro\-discursive and policy paradigms level, most specifically in relation to ethno\-religious accommodation, employment, and higher education. His theorisation of Islamophobia as a form of cultural racism has been adopted by MPs, a range of UK political parties, and other policy actors. His engagement with policy makers has shaped the work of the Muslim Council of Britain and other Muslim organisations. His thinking on issues of ethnicity, religion and citizenship has longer\-term resonance: it is now included in A\-level subject content for English schools. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The integration of Muslims in countries in which they have settled in large numbers is a central and controversial societal matter – politically, in media discourse, and academically. Modood has substantially contributed to vital issues around ‘Islamophobia’, multiculturalism and national identity by developing a sociologically grounded theory of political multiculturalism, together with making the case for a new style of moderate secularism. He has helped design, capture funding for, and conduct a number of empirical research projects. While the Bristol\-UCL Leverhulme Programme **\[i\]** enabled him to focus his research on the UK, his theoretical lead in two European projects **\[ii\] \[iii\]** achieved this at the European level and is currently being followed up by Plurispace **\[v\]** and a project across eight global regions **\[iv\]**. The Thinker\-in\-Residence post at the Royal Academy of Flanders **\[vi\]** allowed him to prepare a report on political secularism and religious education in Flanders. His work encompasses three strands: 

### 1.  Conceptualising Islamophobia as a form of cultural racism 

 Modood has been at the forefront of theorising Islamophobia as a form of cultural racism, moving it away from the previously dominant definition of ‘fear of Islam’ **\[3.1\] \[3.2\] \[3.3\] \[3.5\]**. His research explains the racialisation of Muslims in Western Europe, especially in the UK, by reference to issues such as discrimination, free speech and incitement to hatred, identity assertiveness, institutional accommodation and the re\-making of national identity **\[3.1\] \[3.3\]**. He has sought to develop a research agenda that goes beyond anti\-racism, critiquing the difference\-blind neutral liberal state model in favour of active de\-othering, and has devised a way of testing, based on five tests, for distinguishing Islamophobia from reasonable criticism **\[3.3\]**. 

### 1.  Rethinking secularism in the UK and beyond 

 Modood’s research shows that equal citizenship requires a difference\-sensitive accommodation of Muslim and other religious identities and that this means rethinking the concept of political secularism **\[3.1\] \[3.2\] \[3.3\]**. He has argued that – contrary to a Rawlsian neutrality, liberal nationalism, and radical secularism – an egalitarian accommodation of Muslims requires the extension of multiculturalism to include ethno\-religious groups; and that this can be done by multiculturalising Western European ‘moderate secularism’ and updating the ‘un\-sociological’ definition of secularism as a straightforward separation of religion and state **\[3.3\]**. 

 Modood has also argued for a concept of multicultural integration that is built on national citizenship \(rather than just localism and/or globalism\) in at least two respects **\[3.2\]**. First, the concept involves a macro\-symbolic integration that cannot be reduced to individual choices, individual integration, local multiculture or local cohesion. Second, the concept fosters new forms of belonging that are best achieved through a suitably pluralised national identity rather than a merely civic one or ‘constitutional patriotism’. Thus, Modood’s ‘multicultural nationalism’ unites the concerns of those sympathetic to majoritarian nationalism and those who are pro\-diversity and minority accommodationist, in a way that liberal nationalism or cosmopolitanism does not **\[3.5\]**. It therefore represents the political idea and tendency most likely to offer a feasible alternative rallying point to monocultural nationalism **\[3.6\]**. 

### 1.  Investigating and addressing the ‘ethnic penalty’ 

 Using his concept of Islamophobia, Modood later investigated with Dr Nabil Khattab \(University of Bristol and Doha Institute\) the ‘ethnic penalty’ experienced by different groups in employment and higher education. Their findings reveal that an ‘ethno\-religious penalty’ is a more accurate characterisation than ‘colour racism’, and that ‘ethnic capital’ – understood as the choices that different groups make and their ability to act in terms of tangible and intangible resources – must be taken into account **\[3.1\] \[3.4\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Modood has made a substantial impact through public intellectual engagement as a pathway to shaping and changing public attitudes around multiculturalism and Islamophobia, especially those of MPs, opinion\-formers, and those involved in pressure\-group politics. The Muslim Council of Britain’s \(MCB\) General Secretary states that Modood has shaped their work ‘ *as an expert and point of reference on the socio\-economic challenges facing British Muslims; as an opinion\-maker in discussions on Islamophobia; as a role model; as a defender of multiculturalism*’ **\[5.1\]**. 

### 1.  Shaping the understanding and definition of Islamophobia in the UK 

 Modood’s conceptualisation of Islamophobia as cultural racism **\[3.1\] \[3.3\]** has led to two major redefinitions of Islamophobia in the public arena. In 2017, the Runnymede Trust replaced its definition of Islamophobia, used since 1997, with Modood’s. According to the Trust’s Director, Modood’s work has had ‘ *a large impact on the way civil society, and hopefully now government, approach the issue. Most importantly, the impact of a definition will lead to better policymaking and response to one of Britain’s most challenging issues: anti\-Muslim racism*’ **\[5.2\]**. The Secretary General of the MCB states that the publication of this definition ‘ *has major ramifications in the way our society moves forward in tackling incidents of bigotry, unfounded hostility and unfair discrimination faced by one faith community. In our view, \[Modood’s\] insistence over many years that Islamophobia was a form of cultural racism has eventually been recognised and appreciated.*’ **\[5.1\]**. 

 In November 2018, the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on British Muslims and Islam also adopted Modood’s definition **\[5.3\]**, recognising Islamophobia as ‘ *a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness*' **\[see also** **5.1, 5.7\]**. Their report states that ‘ *Modood’s definition … encapsulates perfectly the concept of racialisation of Muslims*’ **\[p.40, 5.3\]**, and praises his five tests for distinguishing Islamophobia from reasonable criticism **\[p.36, 5.3\]**. The APPG definition has been adopted by over 22 local councils across the UK, and 70 civic organisations and charities **\[for a full list, see 5.4\]**, as well as the following political parties: Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party, Scottish Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and Scottish Greens. The Labour Party adopted the definition in March 2019 ‘ *to help tackle Islamophobia, build a common understanding of its causes and consequences, and express solidarity with Muslim communities*’ **\[5.5\]**. The Home Affairs Select Committee on Islamophobia also took evidence from Modood and published it in September 2019 **\[5.3\]**. 

### 1.  Shifting political and public debates on multiculturalism worldwide 

 Modood has been a prominent defender of multiculturalism in public arenas worldwide, arguing that his conceptualisation **\[3.1\] \[3.2\] \[3.5\]** continues to be relevant. This work has had a conceptual impact, influencing debates on multiculturalism not only in the UK but in Europe and beyond. 

 In the UK, his membership of the Commission on Religion and Belief in British Public Life \(CORAB, 2013\-15\) influenced its pluralistic\-national focus **\[5.6\]**. Lord Parekh, Patron of CORAB, attests that ‘ *by providing… a public language Professor Modood has most helpfully illuminated a new way of thinking and talking about cultural and religious diversity… which has had quite a lot of impact in Britain and other countries*’ **\[5.7\]**. The MCB, which represents the UK’s largest and most diverse national Muslim umbrella organisation, states that Modood’s ‘ *intellectual defence of multiculturalism … has been important for us in developing reasoned arguments to challenge the claim that multiculturalism fosters alienation and separatism*’ and ‘ *in developing our interfaith relations*’ **\[5.1\]**. 

 The impact of Modood’s work on public understandings of multiculturalism is also evidenced by the fact that his concept of multiculturalism is now, since 2017, included in the A\-Level Politics curriculum \(e.g. AQA\) and has been followed up with a three\-part teaching video **\[5.8\]**. This work has been described as ‘ *invaluable*’ both by teachers and students. The Head of Sociology at Maiden Erelgh School states that Modood’s work challenges students ‘ *to think carefully about the place of religion and belief in contemporary society*’ **\[5.8\]**. A student \(Y13\) remarked on the contemporary relevance of Modood’s work in relation to issues such as ‘ *the Black Lives Matter campaigns and the problem of institutional racism*’ **\[5.8\]**. 

 Beyond the UK, Modood’s argument for ‘multicultural nationalism’ as the best feasible alternative to monocultural, populist nationalism has been included in major reports in Germany \(Bertelsmann Stiftung\) and Flanders \(Royal Academy of Flanders\) **\[vi\]**; featured in leading newspapers in the Netherlands \( *Volkskraant*\) and Denmark \( *Politken*\); and presented to public audiences in Australia, including on an ABC radio discussion programme, and to parliamentary staff in Canberra in July, 2018. Modood was invited to give evidence to the French National Assembly’s fact\-finding mission on ‘The Emergence and Development of Different Forms of Racism’ on 26 November 2020 and to the plenary of the Council of Europe’s European Commission on Racism on 3 December 2020. His work is also a key theoretical basis of the H2020 GREASE project **\[iv\]**, which has engaged with a wide range of publics through Massive Open Online Courses \(1,069 learners enrolled in its first year\), two films \(1,400 views\), and its own webpages on OpenDemocracy \(49,294 views as of 20 October 2020\). 

### 1.  Informing debates on secularism and the role of religion in public life 

 Modood’s work on moderate secularism and religion **\[3.2\] \[3.3\] \[3.6\]** was a contributory factor in the formation of CORAB **\[5.6\]**. As a Steering Group member, he shaped the work of the Commission and its 2015 report, including its use of his concept of ‘ethno\-religious’ groups, shifting the focus from religion to group identity. According to the report, a *‘person’s ethno\-religious identity is not primarily to do with a system of religious beliefs which they may or may not embrace, or various religious practices they may or may not take part in, but with who their parents and family are and how they are perceived, approached and treated by others, regardless of their own wishes and preferences*’ **\[p.13, 5.6\].** CORAB’s report was featured on the front pages of *The Telegraph* and *The Independent* and was formally welcomed by Government in the House of Lords in 2016 **\[5.6\]**. Modood promoted discussion of the report during a two\-day symposium to mark its first anniversary. His theoretical analysis of the ethno\-religious aspect of CORAB has been made accessible to non\-academic online and print readers, including in French in Quebec **\[5.6\].** In the report produced during his KVAB fellowship **\[vi\]**, Modood applied the concepts of multicultural nationalism and moderate secularism to the topics of religious education, instruction, and worship in state\-funded Catholic and secular schools in Flanders. 

 Drawing on his re\-conceptualisation of secularism **\[3.3\],** Modood co\-authored a Leadership Foundation in Higher Education report on religious inclusion, to which an article was devoted in *Times Higher Education*. This report was the basis for a workshop held on 26 March 2018 with 20 managers/officers with responsibilities for student welfare at the University of West of England \(UWE\) – which as of November 2020 has more than 3,000 staff employed and over 30,000 students. According to the Head of Equality Diversity and Inclusivity at UWE, the workshop ‘ *helped to inform the development of our work in a number of ways in the past couple of years*’ **\[5.9\]**. In particular, as part of UWE’s effort to diversify their curriculum and practice, Modood’s work informed efforts to help ‘ *people to understand and expose their own assumptions in our teaching and learning practices*’ **\[5.9\]**. The report has also informed the University’s work on return to campus during the current Covid\-19 pandemic. The personal risk assessment now considers not only health risks from Covid\-19, but also additional risks to being able to work effectively and feel a sense of wellbeing, which for some Muslim staff includes having access to prayer facilities **\[5.9\]**. 

### 1.  Raising awareness about the ‘ethnic penalty’ in the labour market 

 According to the Secretary General of the MCB, Modood’s research constitutes ‘ *a point of reference on the socio\-economic challenges facing British Muslims*’ and has been used in several of their submissions to parliamentary enquiries **\[5.1\]**. Modood’s research on ‘the Muslim penalty’ **\[3.4\]** received widespread media coverage in 2016 and was used by the MCB in its submission to the Women and Equality Select Committee inquiry ‘Employment opportunities for Muslims in the UK’ **\[5.1\].** The report refers to the triple ‘penalty’ experienced by Muslim women in the UK.  Moreover, in relation to his work on the ethnic penalty, Modood was also asked by BBC Inside Out to work on a test to see what effect a Muslim name has on a job application **\[5.10\]**. The high level of discrimination results was broadcast to over 1 million viewers on 6<sup>th</sup> February 2017, and the Facebook video received over 40,000 views, with the film having the highest rating on the series to that date **\[5.10\]**. A 2017 report of the Social Mobility Commission on the Social Mobility Challenges Faced by Young Muslims **\[5.10\]** also cites evidence from Modood’s research on the ethnic penalty **\[3.4\]**.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Preventing “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” is the objective \(Article 2\) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\), and a critical issue for societies worldwide. 

 In 2008 Prof Tim Lenton, then at UEA, and colleagues published a seminal *PNAS* paper that identified ‘Tipping Elements in the Earth’s Climate System’. Building on this work upon moving to Exeter in 2011, Lenton’s team pioneered research to: \(i\) develop and test early warning methods for climate tipping points; \(ii\) quantify how the risks of reaching climate tipping points alter economic analyses of climate change; and \(iii\) assess how interactions between tipping points increase these risks, and the urgency of tackling climate change. Tipping elements are components of the Earth system, e.g. the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Amazon rainforest, which could be pushed beyond a tipping point where reinforcing feedbacks cause them to change state, often abruptly or irreversibly. 

 Risk is the product of the likelihood and impact of a damaging event. To better constrain the likelihood of climate tipping points, Lenton’s team developed and tested early warning methods \[ **3.1**\]; work that was featured on the cover of *Nature Climate Change*. Applying these methods within a climate model revealed that a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation \(AMOC\) carries robust early warning signals and identified which latitudes would be the most effective sites for an early warning system \[ **3.2**\]. 

 
Lenton then co\-edited a book, *Addressing Tipping Points for a Precarious Future* \(London: British Academy \(2013\)\), to start addressing these risks. Lenton and colleagues also worked with the European Environment Agency to identify the climate tipping points most relevant to Europe. This led to a project by the EU Joint Research Centre \(Sevilla\), with Lenton on the advisory board, which assessed the potential economic impacts of these tipping points. Lenton then collaborated with economists to include climate tipping points in the well\-known Dynamic Integrated Climate\-Economy \(DICE\) model. Their first joint study showed that the economic damages from an uncertain future tipping point have a greater influence on present day decisions than the deterministic climate damages in the standard model. This effect markedly increases the estimate of economic damage caused by emitting each extra tonne of carbon, known as the ‘social cost of carbon’ \[ **3.3**\]. A second influential study showed that including five interacting tipping points in DICE radically alters the model’s optimal policy recommendation. Rather than stabilising warming at \~3°C, the recommendation shifts to limiting warming to \~1.5°C, with a corresponding >8\-fold increase in the social cost of carbon \[ **3.4**\]. 

 The same study \[ **3.4**\] also examined tipping point interactions. It showed that if passing one tipping point increases the likelihood of tipping another, this further abruptly increases the social cost of carbon. This result inspired Lenton to assess the latest evidence for tipping point interactions, including how strongly they could feed back to amplify climate change. This was his key contribution to a study concluding that interacting climate tipping points could potentially cascade to cause a global tipping point, creating a ‘Hothouse Earth’ state \[ **3.5**\]. Recently, Lenton and colleagues have synthesised the evidence that multiple climate tipping points may already be underway, with the potential for cascading interactions between them \[ **3.6**\] \(see Figure\). This increased risk provides scientific support for declarations of a ‘climate emergency’ and should compel much more decisive policy action to limit global warming \[ **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Influence on public policy, nationally and internationally** 

 Exeter’s research contributions have been used by governments and public bodies across the globe, and have formed a vital part of the evidence base for climate policies in Africa, Germany, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the United States and the UK, as outlined below. 

 **4.1 Providing vital evidence underpinning goals to limit global warming to well below 2°C** 

 Exeter’s research has identified how the risks posed by climate tipping points increase with global warming, and has been extensively cited in policy responses to the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming “to well below 2°C above pre\-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C”, now ratified by 189 Parties to the UNFCCC. 

 Lenton was a contributing author to the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) Special Report on ‘Global Warming of 1.5°C’ \(SR1.5\) \[ **5.1a**\], commissioned in response to the Paris Agreement. The special report makes the case for ‘Avoiding Regional Tipping Points by Achieving More Ambitious Global Temperature Goals’, and repeatedly cites Exeter’s work \[ **3.4**\]. The 2019 IPCC ‘Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate’ \(SROCC\) \[ **5.1b**\] cites Exeter’s work \[ **3.4**, **3.5**\] on the irreversibility of tipping points and their potential to amplify climate change and concludes: “If carbon emissions decline, the risk of…abrupt changes are reduced” \[ **5.1b**\] **.** These two IPCC reports have influenced global policy directly, and the SR1.5 report is widely used to underpin ambitious mitigation policies and net zero targets. 

 Research by Lenton and his team also underpins a wide range of policy documents internationally. These use climate tipping points to determine targets to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The World Bank’s ‘Next Generation Africa Climate Business Plan’ \[ **5.2a**\] warns that “a 2°C warming could activate important tipping elements, raising the temperature further”, citing \[ **3.5**\]. The UK Government’s ‘Net Zero – The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming’ \[ **5.2b**\] notes that without action, “Risks of crossing irreversible tipping points within the climate system…would be high”. The German ‘coal exit commission’ strategy for phasing out coal\-fired power generation by 2038 \[ **5.2c**\], recognises that “without a dramatic reduction in emissions, the Earth could even be propelled into a ‘hot age’”, citing \[ **3.5**\]. Australia’s ‘Northern Territory Climate Change Response Towards 2050’ \[ **5.2d**\] cites \[ **3.1**, **3.5**\] to support the Paris Agreement target, and cites \[ **3.5**\] in recognising that “Global greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions need to decline rapidly to net zero”. 

 **4.2 Providing an eight\-fold increase in the estimate of the social cost of carbon** 

 Lenton and colleagues’ research to add climate tipping points to the DICE model \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\] increased its estimates of the social cost of carbon up to >8\-fold. William Nordhaus won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2018 for developing Integrated Assessment Models, the first generation of which was the DICE model, and Exeter’s research \[ **3.3**\] is cited in the presentation information \[ **5.3**\]. This crucial finding has had widespread influence on policy. The United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\) ‘Inquiry into the Design of a Sustainable Financial System’ \[ **5.4a**\] cites Exeter’s work \[ **3.3**\] in recognising that “irreversible climate events … could individually cost 10% of global GDP over 50 years”. The 2018 IPCC SR1.5 \[ **5.1a**\] cites \[ **3.4**\] and the 2019 IPCC SROCC \[ **5.1b**\] cites \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\] in recognising that “including extremes and abrupt changes, such as AMOC weakening, ice sheet collapse … leads to a several\-fold increase in the cost of carbon emissions”. The Inter\-American Development Bank cites \[ **3.4**\] to underline the “needed ambition” of emission reduction for climate stabilisation at a safe level \[ **5.4b**\]. 

 **4.3 Informing adaptation advice to international governments on tipping point risks and early warning systems** 

 Lenton and team’s identification of climate tipping point risks and early warning systems for them \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] has informed climate change adaptation advice to governments. 

 Lenton’s work helped drive the “commitment to climate and environmental action” of the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario \(2015\-19\) \[ **5.5a**\]. This commitment led to “three climate and four energy reports …delivered to the Ontario Legislature”, including a 2018 report citing \[ **3.5**\] in a section on ‘Getting ready for what’s coming’ \[ **5.5b**\]. In a subsequent report, the Council of Canadian Academies’ Expert Panel on Climate Change Risks and Adaptation Potential \[ **5.5c**\] recognises the risk of “a large\-scale dieback of the boreal forest”, and notes that the associated “release of carbon stocks” can “exacerbate climate change”, citing \[ **3.1**\]. The European Environment Agency \[ **5.6a**\] recognises that “potential tipping points in the climate system give rise to serious concerns”, citing \[ **3.5**\]. The Netherlands’ Environmental Assessment Agency \[ **5.6b**\] also recognises the risk of “onomkeerbare kantelpunten” \(irreversible tipping points\), citing \[ **3.6**\]. 

 The US Congress commissioned a 2013 report by the National Research Council focused entirely on ‘Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change: Anticipating Surprises’, for which Lenton was a reviewer \[ **5.7a**\] **.** The report cites \[ **3.1**\] and “recommends development of an abrupt climate change early warning system”. The report’s conclusion highlights the need “to be serious about the threat of tipping points so as to better anticipate and better prepare ourselves for the inevitable surprises”. 

 The UK’s Global Food Security programme invited Lenton to co\-author a 2017 report on ‘Environmental tipping points and food system dynamics’ \[ **5.7b**\], which cites \[ **3.1**, **3.3**\] and explores the impacts of an AMOC collapse on food security, stating: “Early warning to allow mitigation and/or adaptation is key to minimising the global disruption this might cause”. The 2019 IPCC SROCC \[ **5.1b**\] agrees: “A specific adaptation action is a monitoring and early warning system using observation and prediction systems, which can help to respond in time to effects of an AMOC decline”. That report cites \[ **3.2**\] to show that “the observation arrays that are in place may allow the development of such an early warning system”. 

 **Influence on public understanding, learning and participation** 

 Lenton and team’s research has also enhanced public understanding of climate tipping points. 

 **4.4 Stimulating public interest and engagement; Informing awareness and understanding** 

 Research by Lenton and his team formed the basis of a 6\-episode television series on ‘The Tipping Points’, featuring Lenton \(opening episode\), which has aired in over 50 countries worldwide to an estimated 500 million viewers \[ **5.8a**\]. Lenton and his tipping points research featured in BBC1’s ‘Climate Change: The Facts’, with 3.56 million viewers \[ **5.8b**\]. 

 ‘Climate tipping points – too risky to bet against’ \[ **3.6**\] \(Altmetric attention score >9000\), was covered by >150 news outlets \[ **5.9a**\]. One article referring to \[ **3.6**\] in Metro received 135.6 million shares \[ **5.9b**\]. Coverage focused on how more than half of the climate tipping points identified a decade ago are now active, with evidence for cascading interactions between them. Lenton appeared on ITV News at Ten \(3.7 million viewers\) \[ **5.8c**\], BBC Radio 4: World at One \(3 million listeners\) \[ **5.8d**\], and Newsday on BBC World Service \(\~1.3 million weekly listeners\) \[ **5.8e**\]. The European Parliament voted to declare a climate emergency on the day after \[ **3.6**\] was published, with *The Guardian* \[ **5.9c**\] linking this vote directly to their coverage \[ **5.9d**\] of \[ **3.6**\]. Reflecting in December 2020, the *New York Times* stated that \[ **3.5**\] and ‘Timothy Lenton’s overview of tipping points’ \[ **3.6**\] ‘have galvanized the climate movement’ \[ **5.9e**\]. Also Exeter’s climate tipping points research has been shared with the public through a Massive Open Online Course, ‘Tipping Points: Climate Change and Society’ \(lead educator: Lenton\), with >13,000 enrolments \[ **5.10**\]. 

 **4.5 Contributing to a change in public perception and mood** 

 ‘Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene’ \[ **3.5**\] was the 4<sup>th</sup> ranked article of 2018 on Altmetric \[ **5.9f**\] \(attention score 5694 in 2018, >7000 in Dec. 2020\) with coverage in >350 news outlets \[ **5.9g**\]. CarbonBrief ranked it the most impactful climate research paper of 2018 \[ **5.9h**\]. Media coverage focused on the possibility that an irreversible cascade of tipping points could lead to a ‘Hothouse Earth’ state. Dr Gail Bradbrook cites “the Hothouse Earth paper” \[ **3.5**\] in an influential video that helped motivate the Extinction Rebellion protest movement \[ **5.11a**\]. ‘Hothouse state’ became a new buzz phrase mentioned in the UK parliament \[ **5.12a**\], and in Germany ‘ **Heißzeit’, a term already linked to \[3.5\] \[5.12b\],** was voted word of the year 2018 \[ **5.12c**\]. Extinction Rebellion also shared a J. P. Morgan special report \[ **5.11b**\] which cited \[ **3.5**\] regarding the risk that interacting tipping elements could trigger “a domino\-like cascade”. This mass awareness\-raising has contributed to a shift in public perception, part of a popular movement which led to declarations of a climate emergency in the UK and the EU in 2019.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Responding to concerns that the lack of a business case for paying a real Living Wage was hindering adoption, Strathclyde research provided evidence that Living Wage accreditation enhances financial and social capital for employers as well as improving pay and conditions for low\-paid workers who are most at risk of in\-work poverty. This evidence underpinned the Living Wage Foundation \(LWF\) campaign from 2015, persuading over 6000 companies to become accredited real Living Wage employers between 2015 and 2019 to the benefit of more than 240,000 low\-paid workers. Combined with in\-depth analysis of implementation challenges within the Scottish social care sector, this research has increased and improved adoption of the Living Wage by strengthening LWF strategy and operations, and informing UK, Scottish and Welsh government policy. It has also shaped the development of a global Living Wage standard.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 Drawing on a body of theoretical and empirical research conducted by Dr Andrea Coulson and Professor Ian Cunningham, from 2015 Strathclyde demonstrated the business case for paying a real Living Wage \(LW; a rate independently governed by the Living Wage Commission with employers accredited by the Living Wage Foundation in the UK\) and subsequently provided in\-depth analysis of sector\-specific implementation challenges. 

 Research led by Coulson \(reported in the conceptual paper **R1**\) laid the theoretical foundations for recognising social capital within a business model. It made the case for discharging corporate accountability for the welfare of employees. The research further proposed that understanding capital as a metaphor for resource unties it from its economic and monetary definition, allowing it to be represented by resources with financial and non\-financial values \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. While **R2** examined the challenges of conceiving a multiple capitals framework through a theoretical lens, Coulson also led empirical research to investigate multiple capital frameworks as the basis of a business case for paying a real LW. Through a project funded by the LWF, Coulson drew upon case study evidence of LW employers to show the importance of recognising social values, financial and non\-financial, in implementing the LW so as to contribute to long\-term value creation and resource maintenance \[ **R3**\]. Unlike previous research on living wages – drawn from economic debate on what is an appropriate living wage rate and work, employment and organisational studies on labour rights – Coulson developed a new form of business case, articulated as values\-based, recognising the importance of combining financial value creation and other valuation methods \[ **R3**\]. 

 For this LWF\-funded research project, Coulson designed and undertook primary research and reporting, subject to independent, multi\-stakeholder peer review, on behalf of the LWF Advisory Council. Coulson’s LW research provided case study evidence from businesses of different sizes and sectors – Aviva PLC, Barclays PLC, KPMG LLP UK, Penrose Care Ltd, SSE PLC and Enhance Office Cleaning Ltd – that had successfully implemented the LW and had been accredited by the LWF. Case study evidence was gathered through interviews with senior executives with responsibility for LW accreditation and LW implementation teams. The analysis of organisational values, financial position and social performance information was supported by a review of public and private documentation provided to support interview testimony. This research showed that, for these businesses, the cost of LW adoption was offset by cost mitigation strategies and, when considered alongside investment commitments, these can be designed to create financial and social capital resources and thus improve both the bottom line and employee welfare \[ **R3**\]. The research showed that adopting the LW encourages organisations to re\-evaluate their business models and adjust conditions and working practices of employees to deliver both financial value creation and social welfare improvements. This research showed that organisations can create value by collaborating with service providers and contractors to introduce a LW. It showed that social and relationship capital creation could benefit sectors where pay rates have historically been low. 

 Cunningham identified continuing concerns \[ **R4**, **R5**\] about employers’ ability to pay the LW and with employee morale, specifically in the context of austerity funding and its impact on the stability of organisations and employment conditions in Social Care. Commissioned by the Coalition of Care and Support Providers \(CCSP\), Cunningham evaluated the experiences of publicly funded social care workers paid the real LW under new Scottish Government policy introduced in 2016 \[ **R6**\]. Conducted in collaboration with the Universities of St Andrews and Middlesex, this study found that paying the real LW in Social Care is a significant progressive measure but is bedevilled by flaws in implementation. The research revealed that improved levels of hourly pay for front\-line workers may fail to increase pay, or could lead to pay reductions, because of reduced payments for unsocial hours. Moreover, team leader morale problems were intensified, as Scottish LW funding did not account for reduction in pay differentials with front\-line workers. The research \[ **R6**\] drew attention to the fact that if pay rates improved but working hours decreased, take home pay could suffer, which would defeat the aim of the living wage to reduce in\-work poverty. The research proposed that these flaws could be alleviated by adequate funding, changes to the timing of payments by local authorities, greater consultation between all stakeholders and a stronger understanding among commissioners of services regarding the cost of care. 

 Taken together, Coulson’s and Cunningham’s research demonstrates the value of implementing the LW and addresses the challenges of doing so, particularly in sectors where pay is low, such as Social Care. Both highlight, for LW implementation to be successful, organisations need to increase wage rates and ensure take home pay increases and employee working conditions are improved in line with LW ambitions for higher standards of employee welfare.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Within the context of rising rates of in\-work poverty and worsening pay and conditions for low\-paid workers, Strathclyde research around the real Living Wage \(LW\) informed policy and practice in the UK by providing robust evidence of the benefits for businesses as well as employees. Specifically, the research: 

-  Increased the number of UK accredited Living Wage employers and advanced the development of a global Living Wage standard by demonstrating the business case for adoption. 

-  Informed UK, Scottish and Welsh government policy to improve public and voluntary sector pay and conditions by evaluating practice and providing evidence\-based recommendations. 

###  Increased UK Living Wage accreditation and advanced a global Living Wage standard 

 As a critical first step in overcoming resistance to LW adoption, Strathclyde’s business case research provided evidence of the benefits for employers \[ **R3**\]. As noted by the Deputy First Minister for the Scottish Government at the launch of the report in January 2015, ‘the knowledge exchange project, carried out by the University of Strathclyde and the Living Wage Foundation – and commissioned by Barclays – gives evidence of the business benefits of paying the Living Wage. It isn’t simply good for individuals, it is also good for companies. It helps to increase staff retention, reduce absenteeism and enhance businesses reputation’ \[ **S1a**\]. 

 Having demonstrated these benefits, Strathclyde’s report was used by the LWF from January 2015 to persuade employers to adopt the LW, become accredited LW employers and defend this position to stakeholders. Reflecting on its significance, the LWF’s Assistant Director confirmed that, ‘since publication, the research has been instrumental in helping the Living Wage Foundation to make the case to employers to pay the Living Wage, highlighting both the financial and non\-financial impact of the Living Wage in creating value, and providing practical advice about implementation and measurement of the Living Wage in UK businesses’ \[ **S2**\]. 

 More specifically, the report *was* ‘used as an engagement tool in conversations with prospective employers’, with its case studies and insights being ‘embedded in the Living Wage Foundation’s core presentations to employers, local authorities, policy\-makers, civil society organisations and campaigners to build understanding and awareness of the Living Wage’ \[ **S3**\]. Trade unions have also drawn on it to explain and evidence the argument for a Living Wage to members and their employers. For instance, since 2015 UNISON \(one of Europe’s largest unions with more than 1.3 million members, 70% of whom are women\) has referenced the report in its *Campaigning, organising and negotiating for a Living Wage* guidance. The version issued in September 2015 contained an appendix on the business case, with a link to the full report, alongside a letter template to facilitate communication with employers which draws attention ‘to the clear business case for implementing the Living Wage’ \[ **S4a** pp.14\-15\]. Clearly considered of benefit, reference to the report was carried through to UNISON’s *Bargaining for the living wage* guide \(last updated 2018\) which includes quotes from Barclays, Penrose Care, SSE and PricewaterhouseCoopers ‘to reflect the positive experiences of major organisation that have introduced the Living Wage’. It also advises that ‘the information set out in this section can be selectively incorporated within an annual pay claim or launched as a separate initiative’ \[ **S4b** p.4\]. 

 As a result of this activity, ‘since the research was undertaken in 2014, the number of accredited Living Wage employers has risen from around 1000 to almost 7,000 across the UK, including over 40% of the FTSE 100’ which ‘has led to pay rises for over 240,000 employees and put over £1bn back into the pockets of low paid workers’ \[ **S2**\]. Moreover, the case study evidence has had impact across the business supply chain. The extension of the LW to service contracts is a clear example of this, as noted by the Emeritus Chair of the LWF Board in November 2017: ‘The Service Providers Leadership Group used the report in their discussions with prospective clients to encourage the adoption of Living Wage compliant service contracts. By their estimation some 60\-80% of cleaning contracts by the major service industry players are now paying a living wage’ \[ **S2**\]. 

 Evidence from Barclays obtained through Strathclyde’s case study research has subsequently been reproduced in the *Living Wage Investor Toolkit* \(2020\). Aimed at encouraging investors to engage their portfolio companies on fair pay and encourage them to become Living Wage accredited employers, this toolkit is as an important part of the Build Back Better campaign to mitigate the impact the COVID\-19 pandemic on businesses. Launched by the LWF and ShareAction in September 2020, the toolkit notes how Barclays gained reputational benefit as a sustained by\-product of paying the LW, which has helped the company to offset the additional cost of paying the LW. It also affirms the importance of long\-term value drivers as outlined in the business case, with Barclays stressing that ‘being an accredited Living Wage Employer is a practical demonstration of our values in action’ \[ **S5**\]. Reference was also made to the business case and report in the design of a survey of LW employer experience by Cardiff Business School, which was commissioned by the LWF in 2017 and addressed to all accredited employers \[ **S6**\]. 

 By encouraging and supporting implementation of the LW, this sustained activity has positively affected employment conditions. Taking Scotland as an example, LW accreditation has played a key role in improving security of employment across the country. According to recent analysis undertaken by the Fair Work Convention, ‘of the 5 dimensions of fair work, security has seen the most improvement in the past 5 years. The Convention’s composite measure of security of employment, hours and pay shows that security of work in Scotland has improved, largely due to improvements in the real living wage’ \[ **S7** p.7\]. More specifically, ‘the proportion of employees \(18\+\) earning less than the real living wage decreased from 19.6% in 2015 to 15.2% in 2020’ \[ **S7** p.43\]. Testimonials shared on the Living Wage Scotland website speak to this and the broader social and economic benefits, with Dumfries and Galloway Council considering ‘accreditation as the most important contribution to tackling poverty across Dumfries and Galloway’ and Fords Daly Legal observing that ‘it's helped the business become more robust and able to weather challenges due to the dedication and commitment of staff’ \[ **S1b**\]. 

 Furthermore, due to the success of the UK Living Wage campaign, the report has gained international attention. As well as supporting the establishment of Living Wage groups in Hong Kong and the USA \[ **S2**, **S8**\], it has shaped the development of a global Living Wage Standard \[ **S2**\] and directly informed public policy in Ireland. Shortly after the report launch in 2015 *, ‘the report was distributed to employers at an Irish Government convened meeting in Dublin which initiated a government policy discussion on productivity and the Living Wage’,* as a result of which the opposition party, Sinn Fein, *‘adopted a Living Wage as their official policy on low pay*’ \[ **S6**\]. Affirming the global influence of the LWF’s work in relation to the UN Sustainable Development goals, the CEO and Executive Director of the UN Global Compact, the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative, has commended *‘the UK Living Wage Foundation for the lead it is showing in promoting the business case for the payment of a decent level of income and demonstrating how it can be adopted in practice’* \[ **S9**\] *.* On this basis they have urged *‘all employers to review their policies and practices in relation to this matter and to commit themselves to making what would be a very significant contribution to the achievement of the UN’s transformational vision’* \[ **S9**\]. 

###  Informed government policy to improve public and voluntary sector pay and conditions 

 As well as using the report to convince organisations to adopt the Living Wage, Barclays PLC employed Strathclyde’s report \[ **R3**\] to inform MPs and policy makers of the evidence for the business case for a Living Wage. Following the report launch in 2015, they circulated the report within the UK Government, including members of the APPG on Poverty and Ministers and Secretary of State in the Department for Work and Pensions \(DWP\). The research was then used as a point of reference in the Secretary of State’s discussion with the Permanent Secretary about DWP paying the Living Wage and ensuring compliance with Treasury Guidelines on pay \[ **S6**\]. Strathclyde’s research has also helped to convince national and local governments across the UK to apply the Living Wage in procurement processes. As confirmed by the Living Wage Foundation Assistant Director:  *‘*Policy makers in Scotland and Wales have adopted the Living Wage in public sector contracts, as have over 80 councils across England. The Living Wage campaign has impacted national policy and minimum wage levels, most notably influencing the introduction of the governments ‘National Living Wage’ \- a high minimum wage for over 25s which came into effect in April 2016 *’* \[ **S2**\]. 

 In tandem with this, Cunningham’s research on policy and delivery in the Social Care sector \[ **R6**\] informed the work of the Scottish Government’s Living Wage Implementation Group \(LWIG\) in social care from 2018 onwards. As acknowledged by the Scottish Government representative on the group: *‘*the independent research was useful in supporting LWIG to fulfil its role in a more evidenced\-based way: it provided more in\-depth analysis of the issues and made suggestions for both national and local organisations’ \[ **S10**\]. Details of how the report was used and its influence on policy and guidance have also been confirmed by the Scottish Government: 

 *‘*Your draft report was shared with LWIG and we were pleased that you and your colleagues came to present the findings which allowed for more in\-depth discussion with the research team. The findings had implications for future policy and practice in particular for updating our guidance for implementing the real living wage. Following your presentation the LWIG took the decision to discuss the findings at subsequent meetings. Officers from COSLA and Scottish Government met with other networks e.g. commissioners to discuss the findings. We grouped the findings into themes and used them primarily to update and strengthen the living wage guidance which was issued in October 2019 *’* \[ **S10**\]. 

 More specifically, the recommendations from the research supported the Implementation Group’s work by making the process of agreeing costs more transparent, defining costings, clarifying expectations around overnight support and promoting collaboration. Following on from this, Cunningham’s research was used by the Social Care policy in the newly established Fair Work in Social Care Group to develop recommendations on fair work. It was also adopted in the Joint Scottish Government/COSLA Adult Social Care Reform Programme’s commissioning and procurement work\-streams and improved procurement in Social Care \[ **S10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Fundamental research into the behaviour of particles suspended in liquids by Lancaster University \(LU\) researchers has resulted in a number of applications in an industrial context with wide ranging impacts. These include impacts through two companies and related Knowledge Transfer Partnerships \(KTPs\): 

 **Process Instruments \(PI\):** A new sensor for monitoring suspended solids in wastewater was developed as part of a KTP and applied research by LU researchers, leading to two new products \(SoliSense® and TurbSense®\) manufactured by a specialist manufacturing company, called PI. These sensors have the highest specification in terms of range and linearity of any similar commercial sensors worldwide. Since their launch in 2018, sales of over **660 sensors** have exceeded **GBP620,000**. 

 **Crown Paints:** LU researchers have engaged in applied research to help Crown Paints reduce waste production from its paint manufacturing process at its Darwen and Hull plants, **affecting millions of litres of paint it produces across both sites each week**. Impacts include: 

1.  **GBP113,000** per annum saved in the cost of reagents used to remove paint particles from the wastewater they produce across its operations at its Darwen and Hull plants \( **totalling 30,000 tonnes annually**\). 

1.  **GBP145,000** invested in the construction and commissioning of a new waste paint processing plant at their Darwen and Hull manufacturing sites, following the recommendations of the KTP project between Crown Paints and Lancaster University. This includes investment in the enhancement of water metering throughout the Darwin manufacturing site, which has enabled a full inventory of water usage and the optimisation of wastewater treatment. 

1.  Analysis by LU of magnolia matt emulsion paint produced using recycled water, rather than clean water, showed no adverse effects in terms of colour and opacity and is being adopted into their manufacturing process. 

1.  A new robust model that provides extensive analysis of the dewatering filtration process, yielding the vital physico\-chemical parameters of yield stress and diffusivity for the solid waste “cake” produced \[3.5\]. 

1.  Paint surface analysis using the SEM/EDX at LU has led to a new technique to assist future R&D approaches to paint formulation and to the diagnosis of mechanisms of paint failure.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The amelioration and disposal of wastewater streams is one of the most frequently used industrial processes in the world. For the paints industry, it is a significant source of cost, meaning all companies are seeking to optimise existing processes; waste disposal processes are also under intense scrutiny from an environental perspective, making the process of wastewater from the paint industry an essential focal point for applied research at LU. 

 Fielden has specialised in the development of chemical sensing systems for industrial applications. He has also researched more recently into ultrasonic\-based techniques for efficient removal of suspended particles in water \[3.1\]; and the potential for electrochemical removal of dyestuffs from wastewater \[3.2, 3.3\]. The applications of the novel light\-scattering sensor technology to wastewater monitoring as part of the KTP \[G2\] programme with Process Instruments Ltd, provided detailed insight into monitoring and control systems for treating particle\-laden wastewater, including paint waste. 

 Martin is an experienced chemical engineer split between industry \(15 years in commodity chemicals and water\) and academia. During his career, he has worked on solid\-liquid separations for systems as diverse as water treatment, mineral “slimes” dumps and antiperspirant specialising in the development of rigorous design methods \[3.4\], techniques for modelling and optimising systems\) 

#  Applications to partner projects 

 This Impact Case Study concerns three research projects that address the monitoring of suspended solids in treatment of wastewater \(Process Instruments\); a move towards a circular economy with paint waste \(Nimtech\); and the elimination of waste in paint manufacture \(Crown Paints\). The three projects are linked, as the preliminary feasibility study with Nimtech \(“Paint Loop” MRes joint funded by Nimtech \(GBP30,000\) and the Centre for Global Eco\-innovation \(CGE\) at Lancaster University \(LU\)\) was based at Crown Paints \(Darwen site\) who provided the source of paint waste. This encouraged Crown Paints to engage in a more substantial programme with LU \[G1\] A parallel programme between LU and Process Instruments \[G2\] developed a sensing platform for monitoring suspended solids in wastewater. The technical knowledge of PI concerning the dosing of particle\-laden waste with aluminium sulfate and polyclay, led to sharing of their understanding and best practice with the Crown Paints project, through the common project principal investigator \(Fielden\). 

 This combined expertise of Fielden and Martin, along with an earlier feasibility study on paint waste with Nimtech Ltd \(Fielden as Principal Investigator, Wardrop as the RA\), where Crown Paints Ltd were the third\-party collaborator, catalysed Crown Paints \(Darwin, Lancashire\) to enter a partnership funded through a KTP grant \[G1\] \(Fielden as Principal Investigator, Martin as Co. Investigator, and Wardrop as RA\). **This was the first research grant between Crown Paints and LU, and indeed, the first major grant\-funded research partnership between Crown Paints and a UK university in its 250\-year history.** 

 One of the higher volume waste streams is wastewater \(effluent\) from Crown’s two manufacturing sites based at Darwen and Hull, which totals approximately 30,000 tonnes annually. Despite the huge quantities, the effluent is pre\-treated in effluent treatment plants at both sites before being piped for secondary water treatment. Crown’s effluent treatment plants also produce a by\-product from this process themselves, which although currently regarded as waste has potential value which is yet to be utilised. Our research has worked to help reduce the volume of this effluent at source, to understand the underlying chemistry of the waste treatment process leading to its optimisation and associated cost reduction, whilst investigating possible uses for the biproduct \[3.5\]. The key elements of the research carried out within the KTP project with Crown Paints include: 

1.  **The compilation of a full inventory of all water used on the Darwen site \(including a considerable component of rainwater that also ends up in the waste stream\)**: This has informed Laboratory\-based experimental investigations by Lancaster University researchers, including: chemical analysis of small\-scale paint formulation and recycling of the recovered water into the primary paint production, revealing that recycled water did not adversely affect the properties of the paint: using magnolia matt emulsion paint \(the company’s highest\-volume product\), colour and opacity tests **showed an insignificant change to the optical properties of the paint formulated with recycled water.** Findings published in \[3.5\] 

1.  **The investigation of possible alternative dewatering technologies**: Apart from the filter press, which is currently used, centrifugation was considered as a possible alternative. \(Initially, ultrasound precipitation \[3.1\] was also considered, but measurement of the particle size distribution in typical paint waste ruled this out\). No other technologies came near to the filter press or centrifugation in a literature and patent review conducted by Lancaster University. 

1.  Pilot laboratory studies into the electrochemical removal of paint dyes from wastewater \[3.2; 3.3\] were carried out on dilute solutions of dyes used in the colouration of Crown’s paint products, followed by direct electrochemical processing of dye\-laden paint wastewater. Whilst the results demonstrated some reduction in the dye components, the process was not sufficiently efficient to warrant further investigation or scale\-up. 

1.  **An analysis/optimisation of the chemistry of the coagulation/flocculation process, to reduce waste and improve efficiency**: The optimisation research identified a much ‘leaner’ combination of aluminium sulfate and polyclay provided the desired coagulation/ flocculation \[3.5\]. This element of research was underpinned by expertise from Process Instruments, who provided comprehensive technical information of the underlying chemistry of aluminium sulfate\-based coagulation, and its control for the removal of particulate matter from wastewater. **This was the major research study of the KTP programme.** It led to the construction of a laboratory\-scale “mimic” of the filter press system, with an added automatic and programmable control for the pressure\-applied piston, which forces the flocculated waste within a cylindrical chamber through a circle of the same filtration membrane material used in the full\-scale filter press. The laboratory instrument also recorded the linear progression of the piston in the cylinder, as the flocculated waste was dewatered at constant, or programmed, applied pressure. The pressure, linear displacement, and time data were then analysed by a new model developed as part of the project. This model demonstrated the efficacy of the scaled down filter press mimic and led to the provision of vital physico\-chemical parameters that revealed how different formulations of the reagents would influence the “yield stress” and “diffusivity” of the solid waste “cake” formation. Three principal formulations of low, medium and high polyclay dosing have been described in the associated publication \[3.5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

#  4.1 Design and introduction of novel technologies for the measurement of suspended solids in liquids and its commercial uptake – Process Instruments 

 Process Instruments \(PI\) Ltd are a SME who specialise in the measurement and control of water disinfection \(potable and swimming pools\), and the measurement and control of particle removal from potable and wastewater through coagulation and flocculation methodology.  The desire to manufacture their own particle sensors, instead of relying on other commercially available devices from third\-party suppliers Stemmed from the fact that, prior to the KTP programme with Lancaster University, there was no single sensor on the market that could span the range of 2NTU to 8% particle concentration; two separate sensors were required to achieve the same effect. 

 Optimisation of the chemistry of the coagulation and flocculation processes by Lancaster University \[3.5\] within the KTP programme, led by Fielden, resulted in the successful development of a particle sensor that could monitor the range of 2 NTU to 8% particle concentration, with **significantly superior stability, linearity and dynamic range** compared with any current commercially available particle sensor for deployment in both potable and waste waters. This enabled PI to launch **two new products**: SoliSense® \[5.1\] and Turbsense® \[5.2\].  Turbsense® is a further variant of the SoliSense® device, which has given Process Instruments a sensor design that covers extremely low concentrations of particles in water \(0 to 10NTU\). The sensor designs are very similar but adjusted for very low particle concentrations and combined with a specialised water sampling device \(developed internally by Process Instruments as a follow\-on to the KTP project\) to eliminate the errors associated with micro\-bubbles. 

 SoliSense has the greatest dynamic range of any commercial particle sensor and is a **unique selling point,** since third\-party end users only need to purchase a single sensor, which reduces both initial cost and halves maintenance costs thereafter. Furthermore, the linearity of the sensor developed through \[G2\] has enabled the subsequent development of a **novel patented algorithm** \[5.3\] that fully compensates for drift, which is a significant problem with conventional suspended solids sensors. Since their launch in 2018, both SoliSense® and Turbsense® are **manufactured by PI at their Burnley factory**, and have sold **over 660 sensors with sales exceeding GBP620,000 to end users in 24 countries** \[5.4\]. 

#  4.2 Improved awareness and understanding of waste generation in paint manufacture resulting in changes in practice and process at Crown Paints 

 The partnership between Lancaster University researchers and Crown Paints was initially motivated by the company’s ambition to reduce the waste it generated as part of the paint manufacturing process, with the goal of becoming a net\-zero waste paint manufacturer \[5.5i\-ii\]. **New water metering systems were installed** at critical points in the manufacturing plant to gain the first accurate inventory of clean water usage and wastewater generation. This inventory enabled a **clearer understanding of the origins and volumes of the paint waste streams**, and the frequency of their generation throughout a production cycle and over the calendar year. The findings showed that Crown generated around **30,000 tonnes of wastewater** \(effluent\), and **120 tonnes of waste paint** per year \[5.5i\]. 

 Initial research focussed on the chemistry of particle removal from paint waste, through the addition of the key reagents of aluminium sulfate and polyclay, and on the importance of pH control. This research was carried out using a jar test in the Crown Paints analytical development laboratory. **The understanding of how reagent dosing influenced the flocculation of the particulate waste was assisted through technical advice and drew on equipment provided by Process Instruments** \[5.4\]. This important link between the companies was inaugurated by Fielden, as Principal Investigator to both research programmes, who realised the potential benefits to the Crown Paints project of the more effective particle\-sensing technology developed by PI. 

 This detailed understanding allowed trials and optimisation of a modified dosing chemistry to be carried out \(in particular, determination of the minimum amounts required of aluminium sulfate and polyclay to deliver efficient flocculation\) within the treatment plants at Darwen and Hull. Consequently, **the dosing chemistry practices were changed at both Darwen and Hull \(affecting over a million litres of paint manufactured each week across the two sites\) based on the KTP studies, grounded in the technical expertise provided by Process Instruments and the research expertise of Fielden and Martin from Lancaster University, which has given an annual saving in reagent costs of GBP113,000 pa.** \[5.6\]. This may be broken down into Darwen: \(GBP20,000 pa caustic washings; GBP10,000 pa polymer washings; GBP5,000 pa in lower polyclay dosing; GBP18,000 pa in the reduction of plant washing due to increased process efficiency\) and Hull: \(GBP40,000 pa in reduced polyclay and aluminium sulfate consumption due to optimisation of the reagent formulation in waste filter cake generation\). 

#  4.3 Fundamental research into the optimisation of the flocculation chemistry and the improved efficiency of dewatering by filter press. 

 Novel benchtop apparatus, designed and constructed by Fielden and Martin, allowed for systematic research by Crown and Lancaster University into the interplay between the reagent chemistry and a range of particle\-laden paint waste from representative streams at the Darwen and Hull plants\). This apparatus provided detailed data of the dewatering process, which led to the development of a mathematical model that could evaluate the compression data to yield the key physicochemical parameters of yield stress and diffusivity of the solid “cake” waste generated by the dewatering process \[3.5\]. The outcome of this fundamental research was an optimised formulation for the Crown Paints Effluent Treatment Plants. 

 Thanks to the insights granted by the benchtop test apparatus, alternative dewatering processes were considered as part of the KTP programme, including ultrasonic sedimentation and centrifugation. Centrifugation was considered the closest competitor to the filter press, which resulted in a 6\-month evaluation of a pilot centrifuge system by Crown at their Darwen site. This study showed that the filter press was the most efficient dewatering technology for the removal of particulates from paint waste. Subsequently, **the wastewater treatment plant at the Darwen site was renewed at a cost of GBP55,000, and at the Hull site for GBP70,000 to reflect the outcome of the main element of the KTP programme** \[5.6\]. 

#  4.4 Applied research into the recycling of solid paint waste leading to a reduction is waste production 

 Another project investigated both the recycling of the paint waste “cake” generated by the filter press and the water filtrate. The cake waste is currently sent to landfill but has been shown through the KTP programme to have applications as a “bulking” agent in the manufacture of external masonry paint, which is being acted on by the company to *“to realise the economic and environmental benefits”* \[5.5i\-ii\]. Laboratory\-scale research showed that recycled water from the filter press process could be used in the manufacture of magnolia paint \(the major paint type manufactured by the company\) without detrimental effects on the paint colour and opacity. This finding has already shaped Crown’s knowledge of the process, has helped to reduce waste production in the paint manufacturing of particular products, and is being rolled out across Crown’s large\-scale, complex manufacturing process which includes over a million litres of paint produced weekly \[5.5i\-ii\] and \[5.6\]. 

 **Unplanned in the original KTP programme, it became apparent that the partnership between Crown and Lancaster University could also benefit the company through access to specialist equipment at the Chemistry Department at LU.** Specifically, the polymer development scientists benefitted from access to our Field\-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope \(Jeol JSM\-7800F plus Oxford Instruments Xmax\-50 EDS\) with which they were able to evaluate novel emulsion paint formulations for the structure of the emulsion and the distribution of fillers, such as TiO<sub>2</sub> \[5.6\]. Whilst it is difficult to quantify this element of impact, **the findings have been presented to the parent Hempel Group** by Craig Wood, and represent a **new approach to the evaluation of future paint formulations, referenced in recent company reports as having, and the diagnosis of the failure of paint formulations** \[5.5ii and 5.6\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 German occupation during World War II \(WWII\) had a profound impact on the heritage, memory and identity of Channel Islanders. While the heritage of occupation has been all\-pervasive, it traditionally focused on the occupiers and ordinary islanders. For reasons broadly connected with collaboration, victims of Nazism \(Jews, political prisoners and forced labourers\) were marginalised and their stories have not been told. University of Cambridge research carried out by Carr has led to fundamental changes in the heritage landscape of the islands, evidenced by museum exhibitions, memorials, commemorations and revised war narratives. It has changed public perception of the occupation, encouraging a more pluralistic understanding of the past, and greatly enriched the lives of victims’ descendants. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The German occupation of the Channel Islands from 1940 to 1945 has now been shown by Carr \[R1,R2,R3\] to be similar in many respects to that of occupations elsewhere in Western Europe during WWII: Jews were deported to concentration camps, as were around 250 political prisoners. Sixteen thousand forced and slave labourers were brought to the Islands to build the Atlantic Wall \(the concrete bunker system which covers the islands\), and 2,200 civilians were deported to German internment camps. Yet, each of these victim groups has previously been marginalised in public memory. Reasons included fear of accusations of collaboration, influence of British war narratives focusing on victory at the expense of victimhood, and the opinion that resisters were ‘criminal troublemakers’ who risked bringing retribution upon everybody. There were also political sensitivities vis\-à\-vis collaboration, with roots in the occupation, which have prevented free speech on the issue. 

 University of Cambridge research carried out by Carr from 2007 to 2020 focusses on victims of Nazism during the period 1940 to 1945 and the trajectory of occupation memory and heritage since. It addresses three key areas: 

 1. Uncovering lost histories relating to the Holocaust and Nazi persecution through extensive family interviews, archival research and field archaeology \[R1,R2,R3\]. Research findings include the experience of Britons in Nazi prisons and concentration camps, especially as gleaned from compensation testimonies written in 1965. At Carr’s instigation, these were released to the National Archives by the Foreign Office in 2016. Her work in this area also includes study of post\-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) suffered by Channel Islanders after release from Nazi prisons and camps, trans\-generational memory and the transmission of trauma. 

 2. Researching ‘guardians of memory’ \(former political prisoners and others who safeguarded knowledge of victims of Nazism\) and the role they played in preserving the memory and reputation of victims \[R1,R2,R3,R4\]. Carr has studied, distilled, interpreted and publicised the private archives of former political prisoners from each of the Islands, the ‘guardians of memory’. This work illuminates the vital surviving thread between the war and the recent past in terms of understanding what happens to memory when subjected to official marginalisation and deliberate exclusion. 

 3. Theorising marginalised and taboo heritage, including reflecting on her own activism and its impact \[R3,R5,R6\]. Carr identifies ‘taboo heritage’, a legacy \(in this case of war\) that resists heritage creation because of its sensitivity \[R6\], and observes that it can be overcome through long\-term activism, involvement of local government and the passage of time. 

 The research also demonstrates the importance of ‘incremental memory events’ \[R3,R5\]; transforming Alexander Etkind’s concept of how profound single events change perceptions of the past, Carr proposes that multiple small events, initiated by activists in multiple spheres, can cumulatively change historical narratives. Moreover, Carr \[R3\] shows the value of ‘reparative heritage’, focusing on how ‘small acts of repair’ \( *sensu* Marianne Hirsch and Leo Spitzer\) can operate in the heritage sphere to give voice to those whose histories have been denied legitimacy. 

 Carr’s research has enabled authorities in the Channel Islands to open up the sometimes uncomfortable stories of the past and to incorporate the marginalised into the wider cultural heritage landscape.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 German occupation during WWII shapes the identity of Channel Islanders. Occupation heritage is everywhere, yet that relating to victims of Nazism was, at the start of Carr’s research, nascent in Jersey and almost absent in Guernsey. Proceeding with sensitivity, her research at the University of Cambridge instigated fundamental change in how the occupation is understood and displayed. Her pathways to impact entailed outreach \(e.g. excavation of a labour camp, memorial, digital and television projects, museum exhibitions, public lectures and locating the graves of deportees for descendants\) and formal advisory roles for Heritage organisations \(e.g. the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation\). The impact is in three interrelated areas: The cultural, heritage and arts landscape; heritage infrastructure; and personal family histories. 

 **1. The Cultural, Heritage and Arts Landscape:** 

 In 2015, Carr’s research led to the creation of a memorial to Guernsey Islanders who died in Nazi prisons and camps for acts of resistance \[E1\]. In 2016, she successfully petitioned the Foreign Office to open closed files relating to all British \(including Channel Islands\) victims of Nazism \[E2\]. Concurrently, Guernsey parliament passed a Holocaust Resolution ensuring that Holocaust Memorial Day and Holocaust education take place. 

 Also in 2016, Carr’s research on a Jersey woman who hid a Jewish refugee led to a successful application for Dorothea Weber to be honoured as *Righteous Among the Nations* by Israel, with a memorial unveiled by the Israeli Ambassador \(Figure 1\). Following application by Carr, Weber was also recognised as a *British Hero of the Holocaust* by the Foreign Office \[E3\]. The research led to the novel *Hedy’s War* \(HarperCollins 2020\) by Jenny Lecoat \(born in Jersey\), purchased by the publisher for a six\-figure sum. Lecoat writes of how Carr ‘ *… emailed me \[2015\] to draw my attention to this story … \[her\] research … was invaluable, adding depth, detail and authenticity to my own work*’ \[E4\]. 

 In 2017, a Blue Plaque commemorated the Guernsey Underground News Service \(GUNS\), whose members were deported to Nazi prisons \[E1\]. Carr documented those involved, found the graves of members lost in Germany, liaised with families and wrote the application. 

 The Chief Executive of Jersey Heritage explains \[E1\], ‘ *the work and impact of Dr Carr in the field of Occupation memorialisation has…raise\(d\) the profile of victims of Nazism in the Channel Islands and…create\(d\) a more diverse heritage landscape.*’ As a result, ‘ *public conversation about the Occupation story in Jersey has developed extremely positively to include new stories researched by Dr Carr.*’ 

 **2. Heritage Infrastructure** 

 Carr’s research has transformed heritage infrastructure in the Channel Islands – improving local understanding, tourism and international relations. Jersey Heritage’s Chief Executive \[E1\] attributes ‘ *a significant body of heritage and public history infrastructure including museum displays, memorials, publications, walks, plaques, websites and broadcasts*’ directly to Carr’s work. ‘ *The Occupation period is of great significance in the Island’s cultural memory and destination value in terms of tourism.*’ ‘ *Jersey Heritage contact with visitors, which is infused with … \[Carr’s research\], is around 250,000 per year*’ \[E1\]. 

 Carr reworked the permanent exhibition on the German occupation at Jersey Museum to emphasise Jews and political prisoners \(2015\) and designed a resistance Heritage Trail for Jersey \(2016\) \[E1\]. In Guernsey, her research has ‘ *served to reset the narrative on the war years, in particular shifting the focus back on the islanders rather than the occupiers. Her work with the Deportees Association and the town of Biberach in Germany to which many were deported has helped recognition of this sometimes forgotten group of islanders, and supported the strong links that have developed…*’ \(Guernsey’s Head of Heritage Services, \[E1\]\). In 2018, Biberach Museum and Guernsey Museums & Galleries \(GMG\) drew on Carr’s work for an exhibition in Germany attracting 4,000 visitors. In 2019, GMG hosted the exhibition *On British Soil: Victims of Nazi Persecution in the Channel Islands*, based on Carr’s research and also shown at the Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust & Genocide in London \(Figure 1\) \[E5\]. Guernsey’s Head of Heritage Services \[E1\] writes that it ‘ *was one of the hardest\-hitting exhibitions Guernsey had mounted for a decade and was seen by around 5,000 visitors including local schools*’. Visitor\-book feedback shows the impact of the exhibition; one child commented ‘ *I really didn’t know it \[the war\] was that bad*’ \[E1\].

 **3. Personal Family Histories** 

 Carr’s research has touched profoundly the lives of descendants of resisters who disappeared in captivity. Funded by the EVZ Foundation \(Berlin\) between 2015 and 2019, she created a website documenting every deported Islander, with educational materials \(used to support teacher training in collaboration with the Holocaust Educational Trust\) and archival material from the Channel Islands, UK, France, Germany and elsewhere \[E6\]. She also carried out extensive archival research to find the graves of Islanders, including Joseph Gillingham \(2016\), Joseph Tierney \(2016\), Charles Machon \(2017\) and Pierre Salomon \(2018\). Gillingham and Machon had been members of GUNS, Tierney produced news\-sheets from BBC radio reports and Salomon fought against the Germans in the French army. All disappeared in captivity. 

 In 2015 and 2016, the BBC travelled with Carr to Germany and the Czech Republic to film documentaries reuniting the families of Gillingham and Tierney with the last resting places of their ancestors \[E7\]. The daughters of Tierney and Gillingham attest to the personal impact \[E8\]. Tierney’s daughter writes: ‘ *My family and I cannot thank Dr Carr enough, her exceptional diligence … trace\[d\] my Dad’s journey, finding his grave and finally after 73 years we have closure.*’ 

 The documentaries changed cultural attitudes and created international and intergenerational dialogue around the treatment and fate of prisoners in Germany. Joseph Gillingham’s daughter travelled repeatedly to Halle – the place of her father’s internment and death – to speak to school and university students about his life \[E8\]. 

 The cumulative reach and significance of Carr’s research are widely recognised. In 2019, the Channel Islands appointed her their representative in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance \(she has been a UK\-wide delegate since 2016, for the Foreign Office\) \[E9\]. Carr is one of the eight\-person, government\-appointed, advisory team overseeing content of the new approximately GBP50,000,000 UK Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre in London \[E10\]. On 22 July 2020, the European Association of Archaeologists \(EAA\) took the decision to award Carr its Heritage Prize \[E11\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Startups and scale\-ups need to develop not only technology or products but effective business models to succeed. Research at the University of Cambridge which examines the entrepreneurial lifecycle from startups to scale\-ups and established small and medium enterprises \(SMEs\) provides the foundation for Programmes delivered by the Cambridge Judge Business School \(CJBS\) Entrepreneurship Centre since 2013. The centre’s Accelerate Cambridge \(AC\) programme has supported 253 companies, which have raised GBP230,600,000 in grant and venture capital funding, creating hundreds of jobs. In total 191 SMEs from across the UK have participated in programmes related to scaling, the Strategic Growth programme and Barclays ScaleUp UK \(BSU\). Those on the BSU programme achieved an average 28% sales growth in the following year, with 89% executing the growth plans developed during the programme to further develop their business.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The transformation of new ventures from ideas into sustainable growing businesses has been an increasingly prominent driver in the growth of the UK economy. However, there is a gap in knowledge on how technology can combine with business models to create sustainable businesses. Entrepreneurship research within CJBS at the University of Cambridge has focused on developing managerial strategies and toolkits, as well as gaining theoretical insights on how to resolve tensions of scaling technology\-based ventures. 

 <ins>Unlocking new venture value through transformative business models</ins> 

 Scalable new ventures are built on a foundation of technology that can meet evolving market needs. Research on transformative business models in 2016 **\[R1\]** uncovered six transformative elements underpinned by technology which enable new ventures to meet market/consumer needs in a way that generates strong growth. A survey of 40 “unicorn” companies from across the globe – those exhibiting continued growth and reaching USD1,000,000,000 valuations, including UK and Cambridge\-based firms \- helped identify and explain the role of these elements in transformation. This effect of the business model elements highlights the importance of a mindset shift away from considering technology as “the business” towards technology *enabling* a transformative business. 

 Ladas, Kavadias, and Loch’s work on competing business models in 2020 **\[R2\]** deepened the insights of **\[R1\]** by developing an economic theory foundation to justify the value of one of the transformative business model elements, namely the usage\-based pricing. The theory explains the reasons for the observed wide presence of pay\-per\-use \(PPU\) service offerings, displacing product selling and ownership, and transforming many industries. The paper’s theory rigorously establishes the conditions under which a PPU model may be favourable for a new venture over traditional product sales. It shows how various technologies \(e.g. payment technology, sensors\), which reduce service logistics costs \(e.g. billing, tracking\), work together to allow companies to meet a customer demand for low\-frequency usage, and in so doing ultimately expand their market. 

  

 <ins>Scaling businesses through business model adaptation</ins> <ins>and pivoting</ins> <ins>– the value of management practices and processes</ins> 

 Adopting and implementing a robust business model relies on management actions that enable a systematic cycle of revision and feedback that occurs continually through the entrepreneurial journey – a series of “pivots.” To benefit from pivoting, businesses need to embrace three important approaches. 

 First, the build\-up of the professional management skills required for the transitioning from an idea to a startup and then to a scale\-up with a robust business model and growth trajectory. A report by the CJBS Entrepreneurship Centre in 2016 **\[R3\]** built a framework for enabling the scaling of businesses in the UK. It develops growth strategies with their associated management skills, leading to six recommendations for SMEs, government, and business creation partners \(e.g. financial services\). 

 Second, the explicit retrospective imagining of alternative scenarios that did not happen, known as *counterfactual thinking.* **\[R4\]** shows that it is an enabler of business model adaptation during growth. Specifically, venture founders who employed counterfactual thinking, to contrast deficiencies of past and present actions by imagining superior alternatives, were able to successfully pivot. By drawing on perspectives from psychology, the study advances the understanding of pivoting as a process that relies on founders’ abilities to reflect creatively on what did and did not succeed. 

 Finally, the contingency of pivoting choices on the business environment. Tracey’s work in 2020, **\[R5\]** illustrates the process that new venture founders undertake to manage competing expectations from multiple important stakeholder relationships during the pivoting process \-\-\- stakeholder relationships are sources of uncertainty just as much as technologies themselves. Tracey highlights the major challenges from and strategies for achieving major stakeholder related pivots.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research conducted at CJBS at the University of Cambridge has established the fundamentals of modern *transformative* business models and the skills to implement and adapt that are essential elements in new venture and SME success. These insights are used to underpin an established set of tailored teaching and mentorship programmes at the Entrepreneurship Centre. 

 The Entrepreneurship Centre stands on three programme pillars to provide support across the new venture lifecycle: idea generation and entrepreneurial learning through cross\-disciplinary programmes; business creation and starting up through Accelerate Cambridge; and finally, scaling up and growth through the Strategic Business Growth and Barclays ScaleUp UK programmes. Since 2013 over 300 founders and venture leaders have been equipped with the practical skills to successfully start up and scale up businesses through these programmes. 

 <ins>Creating Long\-Term Growth Businesses through Accelerate Cambridge</ins> 

 The Entrepreneurship Centre focuses specifically on creating growth businesses, which will generate employment and economic prosperity. Findings from research on the entrepreneurial process described in section 2 have been central to the approach undertaken by the AC programme, a business accelerator housed within the centre. Its teaching and mentoring emphasize the need for both a well\-developed business model and the process of pivoting the model at key points. AC has nurtured 253 ventures since 2013 which have raised a cumulative GBP230,600,000 including major development grants, seed capital, and venture capital from a range of international investors, creating jobs and opportunities in the Cambridge region **\[S1\]**. 

 Ventures like Spirea joined AC with substantial scientific or technical knowledge but with a limited understanding of business models. Business mentors and structured seminars guide ventures through the underlying principles of transformational business models drawn from key research insights, and their practical application. The founder of Spirea, which in July 2020 secured seed funding **\[S2\]**, suggested that the focus on designing a business model *“to leverage the scalable components of my product has been extremely beneficial in identifying how I can grow and attract support along the way, including biotech partners and funders.”* **\[S3\]** 

 AC’s approach ensures that new ventures pursue business models that are asset\-light, agile and capture value through personalisation **\[R1\]**; an example is HealX’s use of Artificial Intelligence to repurpose existing drugs to treat rare diseases. Throughout the process, founders are challenged to refine their value proposition and to define their business models. Moreover, the programme team helps businesses to nurture the right connections across the Cambridge ecosystem to ensure that they have wide access to potential customers, mentors, and funders as well as to opportunities to identify alternative pathways for their business **\[R5\] \[R4\]**. The founder of Pharmenable highlights how *“To date, we have grown our company from an idea to working with a number of multinational pharmaceutical companies since joining the programme and are currently on track to raise a seed funding round of £1.8 million. The  programme was invaluable in helping us continue to drive our business forward, constantly reinventing, reimagining, and pivoting in the early stages”* **\[S4\]**. 

 <ins>Enabling s</ins><ins>caling up and growth:</ins> <ins>developing</ins> <ins>tools for SMEs</ins> 

 Whilst the AC focuses its impact on the Cambridge entrepreneurial ecosystem, the Strategic Business Growth programme has reached businesses across different regions of the UK, and beyond \(Greece\). 

 The programme began in 2014 and has since been delivered to over 60 businesses, many of which continue to experience significant growth. For example, Satavia, which participated in the programme in 2019, used the Growth Trajectory plans developed in the programme to “ *formalize our business planning process… \[which\] has made a massive positive impact on the growth of SATAVIA Ltd” \(CEO & Founder, Satavia\)* **\[S5\]**. This has enabled them to build an investable business plan that has resulted in a GBP1,000,000 investment less than a year after completing the programme \(between October 2019 and January 2020\) **.** Additionally, the company has won a large project funded by the European Space Agency for EUR1,900,000, and has grown the team to 18 staff members \(12 of those full time\) **\[S5\]**. 

 Peterborough based law firm, Taylor Rose TTKW, completed the programme in 2016 following a major growth event, merging with Tucker Turner Kingsley Wood in 2015. Their developed growth plan boosted consulting revenue from GBP3,200,000 to GBP5,100,000 in 10 months, two months ahead of target. Since then, the firm has used the growth plan framework to forecast GBP20,000,000 in consulting revenue in their current fiscal year and plans to complete the Strategic Business Growth programme again in 2021 *“to review market opportunities/business strengths afresh and update our strategy for the next few years”* **\[S6\]**. 

 Through both its startup and scale\-up programmes, the Entrepreneurship Centre has enabled companies to achieve significant, sustained growth in investment and employment to benefit the UK economy. HealX’s participation in both Accelerate Cambridge and the Strategic Business Growth Programmes has unlocked their potential to envision growth and develop strategies to achieve it. Recently, they were recognized as one of the “Top 100: Britain’s Fastest\-Growing Businesses” in a leading industry report **\[S7\].** Recent raising of a Series B round of USD56,000,000 has enabled them to grow their team to over 50, all new jobs which require technology and scientific qualifications **\[S8\].** *“Since joining the programme in 2014, our company has grown from just a handful of employees to targeting upwards of 75 full time staff by the end of 2020. We have raised over £65 million in funding since that time and continue to grow.” \(CEO & Founder, HealX\)* **\[S9\]** 

 The Entrepreneurship Centre has established its reach beyond Cambridge through strategic partnerships with Barclays and the CJBS Executive Education programmes. The Barclays ScaleUp UK programme has reached 131 scale\-ups based on critical gaps identified in management skills in **\[R3\]**. A recent survey **\[S10\]** of leaders from businesses who completed the Barclays ScaleUp UK programme found significant positive impact after completing the training. This initiative demonstrates the Entrepreneurship Centre’s contribution to fostering entrepreneurial capability across the country.

 <ins>Advancing</ins> <ins>the growth potential of UK SMEs and new ventures</ins> 

 Hundreds of SMEs and new ventures have participated in programmes based on the research and translation of entrepreneurial tools in the CJBS Entrepreneurship Centre since inception in 2013. This has resulted in a transformative level of entrepreneurial upskilling within Cambridge and across the UK, skills which are essential in the continued development of the economy and recovery in the current uncertain times. Programmes like Accelerate Cambridge continue to attract significant attention and result in the creation of new ventures, jobs, and economic benefits. In this way, the Centre continues to demonstrate continued impact through building sustainable and scalable growth ventures.

Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Pinsky has revolutionised how information about air pollution and toxicity can be disseminated, in a non\-toxic and accessible manner. His *Pollution Pods* art installation has toured internationally and helped visitors, including policy makers and UN delegates, grasp the global implications of declining air quality for health and wellbeing. The effect of his installation differs from other educational methods by stimulating multiple senses directly and invoking emotional rather than purely intellectual responses.

 Figure 2. In Transit gallery display 



 Figure 1. Plunge in situ 





Throughout his research, Pinsky uses his art pieces to bring awareness of climate change to the general public, promoting positive behaviour change and supporting education. Pieces such as *Plunge* **\(R1a, b\)** or *In Transit* **\(R2\)  visualise encroaching climate issues; rising sea levels and non\-fiscal costs of transport modes respectively. *Pollution Pods* **\(R3\)** builds on his experience with climate activism art and collaborative studies to create an art piece optimised for climate psychology and advocating for behaviour change in his audience. 

 The *Pollution Pods* were commissioned by and developed with The Norwegian University of Science and Technology \(NTNU\) as part of a multidisciplinary investigation of environmental psychology, visual art and communication around climate concerns. Based on findings from Phase 1 of the project, which collected data on the mechanisms prior artwork employed to illicit changes in emotion and opinion **\(R4\)**, Pinsky was challenged with designing an art piece which aligned with the principles set forth by the study: 



-  *Exposure to immersive activism art increased intentions to engage in actions to address pollution and climate change;* 

-  *Sadness, helplessness and anger were strongest emotions impacting intentions to act;* 

-  Figure 3. Model of relationship between climate psychology and art 

*Ascription of responsibility was strongest cognition impacting intentions to act.* **\(R5\)** 

 Pinsky decided to recreate the pollution in five chosen locations representing the least toxic to the most toxic in air quality: Tautra, Norway; London, United Kingdom; San Paolo, Brazil; Beijing, China and New Dehli, India. These locations were chosen to represent how air pollution presents significant risk to the health of local and adjacent populations and to demonstrate the unique circumstances facing the Global South as they wrestle with the causes and consequences of toxic air. The domes are interconnected to illustrate that air pollution is a global problem. 

 When initial recreations proved too toxic for visitors even for short exposure durations, Pinsky reached out to International Flavours and Fragrances \(IFF\) to mix unique cocktails of perfumes, produced by perfumers from the chosen locales. The final concoctions emulated the locations relative presence of ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide within the interconnected pods solely through smell. By combining the perfumes with heaters, humidifiers and misters Pinsky was able to simulate the atmospheres of the locations. The pods evoke a physical and psychological reaction, but the atmospheres are non\-toxic. 

 The materials and design were chosen to avoid contributing to air pollution. Light\-weight reclaimed Norwegian pine forms the frame of the domes and the construction of the tessellated shapes is simple for local staff to construct while the exhibition is touring, ensuring that the pods can reach as many places/people as possible and reducing the installations as well as visitors’ carbon footprint. **\(R6\)**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **1. Changing climate psychology, awareness and education.** 

 
In April 2019, as Pinsky was installing *Pollution Pods* in Vancouver, Canada commissioned as part of the annual TED conference, the Mayor of London announced that 2 million Londoners – including 400,000 children – were living in areas exceeding legal air pollutant metrics **\(S1\).** The global health implications of air pollution continue to require urgent and drastic action from individuals and governments. 

 In surveys of audiences after they experienced *Pollution Pods,* many participants reported an “ *awareness of the environmental consequences of their action, their willingness to take responsibility for their consequences,* and *belief in the relevance of environmental problems for daily life.*” **\(S2\)** 

 


 Figure 4. Visitor enjoys Norwegian air at Somerset House, London 

Pinsky’s *Pollution Pods* succeed in provoking the emotions and cognitions which are most likely to incite positive behavioural change in audiences and, in turn, the global atmosphere. The effectiveness of Pinsky’s approach was recognised in the 2019 textbook *Public/community health and nursing practice: caring for populations* as an aid to help nursing students comprehend the dangers of public health hazards like toxic air and convey them to patients **\(S3\).** 

 Figure 5. Pollution Pods exhibit at TED 

*Pollution Pods* pairs well with educational events such as the King’s College seminar series which was funded by the Medical Research Council **\(S4\)** and the events surrounding the UN Youth Climate Summit New York City, 2019. Pinsky continues to be involved with TED Talks, exhibiting at the annual 2019 conference and delivering a talk at TEDx Freiburg. **\(S5\)** 

 **2. Global Collaboration for Global Problems** 

 As illustrated by the inter\-connected pods, Pinsky emphasises the need for global participation in solutions to climate change. From the inception of the project, Pinsky worked closely with international institutions and corporations: NTNU, IFF, AirLabs, Hubs and the Norwegian Institute for Clean Air. In particular, his commission for IFF and their perfumers brought new opportunity for expert perfumers from those areas to showcase their craft and to participate in political art. 

 Pinsky’s commitment to promoting international responsibility for air pollution has translated into a relevance which extends beyond language barriers, demonstrated by international coverage in English, French, German, Spanish, Korean, Italian, Luxembourgish, Portuguese, Japanese, Swiss, Czech, Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Indonesian. The sustained, global interest in *Pollution Pods* results in sustained interest in air pollution and access to commentary about the project is crucial to reaching people who will not have the opportunity to view the pods in person. 

 Since the initial exhibition in Norway, *Pollution Pods* has toured to eight different countries and over 30,000 visitors have experienced the sensations of the pods **\(S6\).** In each new location, the installation attracts media coverage and engagement. **\(S7a, b, c, d, e\)**

*Pollution Pods* has also reached prominent health and climate activist spokespeople, such as Greta Thunberg and Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus **,** Director\-General of WHO. Between those two figures alone, 6.3 million Twitter followers were engaged specifically with the challenges and consequences of air pollution in the context of wider climate and health concerns. *Pollution Pods* even featured on an episode of Daily Planet, a scientific news show aired on and produced by Discovery Channel Canada.

 During this time, the pods hosted members of the public and delegates from the conference. *Pollution Pods* was especially topical to the delegates, as the conference discussed the parameters of the 2015 Paris Agreement and emission targets. 

 The pods were exhibited as part of Manchester’s 2019 Clean Air Week, a collaborative project between local councils, charities and communities to help reduce air pollution in Greater Manchester and alert the public to health hazards. **\(S9\)** 

 **4. Moving forward** 

 As a result of the positive reception and success of *Pollution Pods,* Pinsky is now working with Professor Stephen Holgate, Medical Research Council Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology, to create a response to the dangers of indoor pollution through olfactory art. **\(S10\)**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study describes impacts of commercially applied design research in the veterinary domain by employing computer\-aided design \(CAD\), non\-destructive testing \(NDT\) and additive manufacturing \(AM\) technologies at the Wales Centre for Batch Manufacture \(CBM\). The research involved **a\)** the design and development of bespoke surgical devices for the efficient treatment of osteosarcoma \(bone cancer\) in large breed dogs across the UK, and **b\)** the creation of bespoke orthopaedic implants for small dogs. The main impacts arising from the research are the development and surgical adoption of a virtual surgery planning system in a 3D design space, and in the design optimisation of two types of surgical device: custom implants and cutting guides. The implant assembly is designed and 3D printed as a single consolidated geometry using advanced AM technologies, such as electron beam melting \(EBM\). The design and production of 3D contoured custom implants and cutting guides match exactly to the individual patient’s anatomy that facilitates surgical accuracy \(such as tumour resection\) and the overall success of the surgical procedure.  Both procedures are now recognised in surgical practice, achieve enhanced surgical outcomes and reduce the surgical time by up to 50%. CBM’s services are accredited ISO13485:2016 for the Design & Manufacture of Custom Made 3D printed surgical guides and implants intended for end user sterilization. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research has been carried out by a medical engineering team at UWTSD’s Wales Centre for Batch Manufacture \(CBM\) in collaboration with British veterinary specialists \(Langford Vets, Moorview Vets and Willows Veterinary Centre and Referral Service\). Initial design research starting from 2016 was conducted as increasing numbers of dogs with congenital spinal malformations were being presented at veterinary referral centres, such as kyphosis which is usually caused by wedge\-shaped vertebrae in the mid thoracic region. Medical design engineers at CBM worked in collaboration with two veterinary neurologists/neurosurgeons Tom Shaw and Tom Harcourt\-Brown \(Langford Veterinary Hospital\) to develop a new surgical technique using additive manufacturing \(AM\) technologies. Example 2 \(part 4\) for instance, shows the anatomical spine model of a 1\-year old pug with a presenting complaint of a kypgotic spinal malformation and associated T3\-L3 myelopathy. The consultant surgeon specified that the case required the developed stackable system of a surgical drilling guide and spinal stabilisation implant. Using virtual planning computer\-aided design \(CAD\) platforms **\[i, ii\]**, the trajectory angles of each screw were placed with the consultant surgeon to allow for the sufficient bone purchase and avoiding any critical anatomical landmarks in the dorsal spinal processes and the chosen vertebras of interest. A surgical drilling guide was additively manufactured in a medical grade biocompatible polymer. Five bicortical pedicle screws and five dorsal screws in the dorsal spinal processes were attached through the 3D printed titanium stabilisation implant to the spine. This and similar research cases contributed to CBM’s accreditation in 2018 for ISO13485: 2016 \(design & manufacture of custom made 3D printed surgical guides and implants intended for end user sterilization\). 

 **Virtual limb sparing 3D planning system** 

 Following the success and adoption of this procedure, further research aimed to overcome the limitations of the conventional surgical implant systems for the efficient treatment of osteosarcoma \(bone cancer\) in dogs. According to veterinary surgeon Jonathan Deacon at Moorview Vets Ltd, the traditional surgical technique for treating osteosarcoma had three main limitations, **a**\)  the unplanned resection of tumour and implantation of multiple plates increases crucial surgical time; **b**\) solid structures of the implants not only make them heavy but also prevent further bone regeneration; **c\)** traditional implant systems frequently require manual adjustments \(contouring plates to match the bone geometry\) that lead to poor surgical outcomes such as inadequate fit and imprecise restoration of anatomical axes of affected limbs. The research commenced from the development of a new CAD methodology. The main aim was to develop a virtual 3D planning system and a set patient\-specific surgical tools to overcome the identified limitations when using traditional limb sparing implants. The research therefore involved the development of the following new surgical tools: **a\)** patient\-specific cutting guides for the precise resection of the affected bone segment by tumour \(Fig. 1, 2\); **b**\) a light\-weight 3D contoured and optimised implant with the incorporated 3D lattice structure that replaces the removed portion of the bone \(tumour\) and propagates bony ingrowth \(Fig 3\). The research involved multiple interactive CAD design screen share sessions with veterinary specialists at Moorview Vets, Ltd and AM fabrication of various design concepts followed by clinical experiments on cadaver dogs. The finalised virtual limb sparing 3D planning system comprises the following steps: 

-  **DICOM data segmentation.** During the segmentation step, captured computed\-tomography \(CT\) scan data are processed in a specialised medical software and an accurate 3D model representation of the affected bone is extracted. 

-  **CAD planning.** The second step involves CAD design of patient\-specific 3D cutting guides and 3D contoured plate with the incorporated 3D mesh structure. The developed virtual planning technique commences from the 3D placement of cutting planes on the extracted bone data. Positioned planes are then employed for the design of personalised cutting guides that specify bone cutting directions and the region of interest \(ROI\). When the cutting guides are designed, the osteosarcoma segment of the bone \(ROI\) is virtually removed. The removed cavity is then employed for the design of 3D mesh structure that stimulates the bone ingrowth when a custom limb\-sparing device is additively fabricated. A custom\-shaped 3D implant is designed to secure two fragments of the affected bone. The designed implant is virtually attached to the limb with cortical and bicortical orthopaedic screws. 3D screw trajectories are carefully planned to achieve the most secure bone purchase. The developed CAD procedure has been adapted for the efficient virtual planning of the angular limb deformity correction in dogs **\[i\]** \(Figures 1, 2,3 and Example 1\). 

-  **Non\-destructive testing.** The designed CAD geometry of the 3D implant is analysed using computational methods, such as Finite Element Analysis \(FEA\). Since the implant is load\-bearing, the aim of the FEA analysis is to mitigate the risks via incorporation of several patient specific scenarios. This involves multiple simulations that are conducted to analyse stress & strain values generated from different gait\(s\) such as walking, trotting, running etc. These simulations are a combination of both static and dynamic analysis that enable in identifying any immediate risk to the implant **\[ii\]** \(Figure 4\). 

-  **3D Additive Manufacturing \(3D AM\) step.** Modelled and analysed in FEA 3D CAD data of the virtually planned patient\-specific limb\-sparing system are then analysed \(post\-processed\) with the specialised industry\-leading 3D slicing software Materialise Magics \(Materialise NV, Belgium\). The 3D slicing software is required for the subsequent layered 3D Additive manufacture step using certified biocompatible materials. 3D CAD data of the anatomical models and personalised cutting guides are fabricated using the Stereolithography manufacturing method \(SLA 5000, 3D systems Inc.\) using a biocompatible \(ISO10993, USP Class VI for short\-term contact with organs and blood tissue\) UV\-light curable resin \(Watershed XC11122\). 3D modelled CAD data of the custom plate with incorporated lattice structures are fabricated on Electron Beam Melting \(EBM\) Arcam Q10 system using a medical grade alloy Ti6Al4V ELI \(implantable devices for long term use\) **\[ii\].**

Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer in dogs, treatable either by amputation or limb\-sparing surgery. Limb\-sparing surgeries, also known as limb\-saving or limb\-salvage techniques, are performed to give veterinary patients an alternative to amputation. During limb\-sparing surgeries the tumorous section of the bone is removed and replaced with either a prosthesis, allograft bone, or allograft\-prosthetic combination. The prosthesis is fixed to the remaining bones with screws and bone cement or the bone grows into the prosthesis. Commercial “off\-the\-shelf” limb\-sparing systems require manual adjustments \(contouring plates to the bone geometry\) that lead to poor outcomes, prolonged surgery time, inadequate fit and restoration of anatomical axes.  In collaboration with British veterinary specialists at Moorview Vets Ltd, CBM has developed a virtual limb\-sparing 3D planning technique to overcome the limitations caused by the use of mass produced devices. The developed 3D virtual planning technique has currently been successfully applied for 14 surgical cases for the efficient treatment of osteosarcoma in dogs across the UK, and surgeons continue to employ the system in very complex cases where traditional solutions are not applicable. 

 
**Clinical outcomes** 

 The surgical procedure adopted by Moorview Vets continues to grow in adoption within the UK veterinary community with successful cases undertaken by Langford Veterinary Services, Rutland House Referrals, K2 Veterinary Referral Ltd and Vet 3D. With further adoption and cost reduction the techniques have the potential to become the mainstream procedure. The carefully planned 3D patient\-specific cutting guides and implants reported above now make it possible to reduce surgery time by up to 50%, improve accuracy and mitigate risks of implant failure by virtually testing the device before the additive manufacture \(AM\) step. This can be followed by the implantation of customised implants, which include a metal mesh spacer attached to the remaining bone. The developed virtual surgical technique is particularly good option for large and giant breed dogs where amputation may not be well tolerated. As demonstrated in Figure 3, 3D printed anatomical models are precise three\-dimensional replicas that provide an invaluable aid of visualising the region of interest at the time of surgery or when planning or discussing treatment options. Anatomical 3D printed models also provide information to surgeons regarding implant components and instrumentation to be used. 

 Key benefits in this regard are: i\) accuracy of tumour resection; ii\) reduced surgical time; iii\) reduced tissue trauma, iii\), improved strength of fixation, and iv\) improved bone regeneration.   The accuracy of the tumour resection and the reduction in surgical time are particularly important as conventional limb spare surgeries carry very high infection rates, these being directly correlated to surgical time and also to some degree the trauma caused by the surgeon during the procedure. In this regard, the trauma is reduced \(although not eliminated\) but the use of the cutting guides and by the use of custom implants as both reduce the amount of dissection and tissue retraction during the surgery.  A second key benefit is that conventional implants are not ideal for limb sparing surgeries. Firstly, because different screw sizes in the radius and metacarpals are usually needed, secondly because the lengths of the solid central section and the sections with holes varies case to case, and thirdly because screws in two metacarpals is usually optimal. While surgeons report that it can be done with normal plates, this is not without compromises \(e.g. pre\-drilled holes are of the wrong size and in sub\-optimal positions\) and the bespoke guides and implant offer improved strength of fixation in this regard. Finally, the use of additive manufacturing to produce the mesh cylinder \(lattice structure\) promotes better surgical outcome with regard to improved bone regeneration.  Traditional limb\-spare techniques use either a metal spacer in the excised radius, just left a gap, put in a cortical allograph, or tried to regenerate bone with distraction osteogenesis. None of these methods are consistently successful in achieving the aim of load\-sharing with the implant. Grafting the bone inside the additive manufacturing mesh by comparison is capable of regenerating bone along the whole deficit and produces the best available clinical outcomes. 

 **Bespoke orthopaedic implants for small dogs.** 

 CBM researchers have also worked in close collaboration with two British vets, Dr Kevin Parsons an orthopaedic vet based at the small animal hospital at Langford Vets, in Bristol, and a former colleague Tom Shaw a neurosurgeon, now at Willows Veterinary Centre and Referral Service in Solihull. The collaboration has developed new surgical procedures employing these virtual planning, non\-destructive testing and additive manufacturing techniques to create bespoke orthopaedic implants for small dogs.  Certain breeds of small dog are genetically prone to developing potentially life changing conditions. In dachshunds and Shih Tzu’s for example, abnormal bone growth can sometimes cause their front paws to point outwards. Pugs and other breeds with corkscrew tails are susceptible to spinal problems caused by misshapen bones. Fortunately, if diagnosed in time, these conditions can be treated with surgery. However, the size and weight of the patients can often present a challenge to veterinarian surgeons. With such small animals, corrective surgery to drill and cut bones, stabilize vertebrae or reposition limbs is a laborious and intricate process, with little or no margin for error. 

 In this regard, since 2016, Parsons and Shaw have been using custom additive manufactured anatomical guides, surgical guides and titanium implants in daily practice with animals referred to them suffering from angular limb deformity or spinal malformation. In doing so, they have not only been able to improve surgical accuracy and the predictability of outcomes, but also reduce theatre time. Integral to Langford Vets’ additive journey has been its partnership with CBM, who oversee the production of bespoke surgical guides \(either in polymer or metal\) and titanium implants to match exactly to each individual patient’s anatomy to restore mechanical and/or aesthetical functions. Each implant design, follows precise specifications from the Langford Vets’ surgical team, using CT or MRI diagnostic imaging data, and is manufactured on a GE Additive Arcam EBM Q10plus on site at CBM’s facility in South Wales.  This is now an established surgical procedure. Routinely employed applications are detailed in examples 1 and 2. 

 
**Example 1. Diagnosis**: Lucca \(Shih Tzu\) at aged one was diagnosed by Dr Kevin Parsons with angular limb deformity. CBM was briefed by Parsons to design and additively manufacture a cutting and repositioning surgical guide required to reposition and straighten the limb and a titanium implant to hold the limb in its new repositioned location. 

 
**Repositioning:** the desired result was for the angular limb to be repositioned to mimic the opposite side limb. The lower limb was to be repositioned into its preferred location and screw trajectories were planned to hold the correction implant in place. 

 


**Surgical Guides:** two cutting planes were used achieve the correct planned repositioned angle of the limb. Four K wires were placed in the limb to be used alongside the two surgical guides to re\-orientate the lower limb. The bone bound surface of this surgical guides contoured the anatomy so that it located and fit accurately onto the bone. The four K\-wires were used alongside the Repositioning Guide to orientate the lower limb into its correct planned position. The bone bound surface of this surgical guide contoured the anatomy so that it located and fit accurately onto the bone. 

 **Implant**.10 screw holes were designed onto the implant to attach it to the limb. The bone bound surface of this Titanium implant contoured the anatomy so that it located and fit accurately onto the bone. 

 


**Example 2. Diagnosis:** Topsey \(Pug\), at aged one, was diagnosed by Tom Shaw with hind limb weakness caused by a severe spinal malformation. CBM were briefed to produce a stabilisation implant required to work in conjunction with a surgical drilling guide. 

 
**Surgical Guide**: Five drill cylinders were used to guide the pilot drill to achieve the correct trajectories. The bone bound surface of this surgical guide contoured the spinal anatomy so that it located and fit accurately onto the bone. 

 **Implant**. Ten screw holes were designed onto the implant and located in the same position as the drill cylinders to achieve the correct trajectories. The bone bound surface of this Titanium implant contoured the spinal anatomy so that it located and fit accurately onto the bone. 

 
**Surgical outcome:** The surgeons now employ this procedure for complex malformations of the spine. They have also starting to use this system as part of surgical treatment for subarachnoid diverticulae, to cover the laminectomy defect and stabilise the adjacent vertebrae. This is to reduce the incidence of adhesions between the cord and surrounding scar tissue, which in canine patients seems to be a the most common reason for recurrence of clinical signs, and to reduce instability to try and prevent cyst reformation.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Translational research by McInnes identified interleukin\-17A \(IL\-17A\) as a novel therapeutic target for psoriatic arthritis \(PsA\), which affects approximately 1% of the population. His subsequent clinical research delivered proof\-of\-concept and phase 3 trials for Novartis’ IL\-17A inhibitor secukinumab. This work supported regulatory approval of secukinumab for PsA \(>80 countries\) and informed UK, European and US clinical guideline recommendations. Global net sales for all approved indications \(PsA, psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis\) were USD13.6 billion during January 2016–December 2020. Secukinumab offers healthcare systems a cost\-effective option for treating PsA. Patients worldwide have benefitted from clinical improvements \(e.g. skin and joint\) and slowing of disease progression, directly improving quality of life.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **IL\-17A identified as a potential therapeutic target for PsA** 

 In 2000, UofG rheumatologist **Prof Iain McInnes** described the cytokine milieu in PsA synovial membranes and showed that the cytokine expression profile in PsA and rheumatoid arthritis synovial membranes differed \[3.1\]. The McInnes laboratory subsequently observed that patients with PsA express high levels of IL\-17A and deduced that this cytokine might offer a therapeutic target for PsA \(Dr Hilary Wilson, Clinical Research Fellow;  [<ins>UofG MD thesis</ins>](https://eleanor.lib.gla.ac.uk/record=b2192560), 2003\). 

 In parallel, McInnes’ team investigated the IL\-12/IL\-23/IL\-17 cytokine regulatory axis in PsA pathogenesis. This work supported regulatory approval of an IL\-12/IL\-23 inhibitor \(ustekinumab\) for treating PsA \(outlined in our  [<ins>REF2014</ins>](https://ref2014impact.azurewebsites.net/casestudies2/refservice.svc/GetCaseStudyPDF/41130) impact case study\), establishing UofG researchers as global leaders in translational PsA therapeutics. 

 **Proof of concept** 

 McInnes proposed PsA as an indication of interest for IL\-17A inhibition through ongoing interactions with the Novartis Scientific Advisory Committee around cytokine biology \[5.A\]. As a result, Novartis invited McInnes to lead a 24\-week phase 2a proof\-of\-concept trial of its IL\-17A inhibitor secukinumab \(then known as AIN457\) among 42 adults with active PsA recruited from across Europe \( [<ins>NCT00809614</ins>](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00809614); 2009–2010\) \[3.2\]. This trial did not meet its primary endpoint of a 20% change from baseline in American College of Rheumatology response criteria \(ACR20\) at 6 weeks, reflecting a composite of articular, inflammatory and quality\-of\-life measures. Nonetheless, secukinumab did demonstrate rapid and sustained improvements in clinical response such as disability and quality of life \[3.2\]. These findings were sufficient in an otherwise discouraging clinical therapeutic landscape to encourage further development of secukinumab with an optimised dose regimen for PsA. 

 **The FUTURE clinical trials** 

 Moving on from the proof\-of\-concept study \[3.2\], McInnes was instrumental in providing advice to generate support within Novartis to advance clinical trials of secukinumab as a treatment for PsA \[5.A\]. He continued to be critically involved in the design of the phase 3 programme for this indication. In 2012, Novartis invited McInnes to co\-lead the Steering Committee for phase 3 clinical trials among adult patients with active PsA, which initially comprised the parallel FUTURE 1 and 2 studies but later broadened to include FUTURE 3–5. McInnes played a prominent role in the leadership of FUTURE 1 \(i.e. he was instrumental in the design and general guidance/shaping of this trial and its outcome measures\); was Chief Investigator for FUTURE 2; and served on the Steering Committee for the extended phase 3/4 programme, particularly post hoc analyses of FUTURE 2. 

 **FUTURE 2** \( [<ins>NCT01752634</ins>](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01752634); 2013–2019\) was the first study to investigate secukinumab administered solely by subcutaneous injection—representing its final approved, indicated dose and route of administration. FUTURE 2 recruited 397 patients worldwide who received either placebo or secukinumab once per week for 4 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter. High doses of secukinumab \(150 mg or 300 mg\) improved signs and symptoms of PsA: 64% of patients had achieved ACR20 at 52 weeks \[3.3\]. **FUTURE 1** \( [<ins>NCT01392326</ins>](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01392326); 2011–2014\) recruited 606 patients worldwide \[3.4\]. The participants received either placebo or secukinumab, initially intravenously every 2 weeks and then by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. By 24 weeks, secukinumab showed superiority in primary and secondary endpoints, with approximately 50.0% of patients in the secukinumab group achieving ACR20 versus 17.3% in the placebo group \[3.4\]. These improvements were sustained in long\-term extension studies of up to 2 years \[3.5, 3.6\]. 

 FUTURE 3–5 provided understanding of the clinical use of secukinumab across the PsA spectrum. **FUTURE 3** \( [<ins>NCT01989468</ins>](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01989468); 2014–2018\) assessed 24\-week efficacy, as well as 3\-year safety and efficacy, of subcutaneous self\-administration of secukinumab using an autoinjector \[3.7\]. McInnes served on the steering committee for this trial. **FUTURE 4** \( [<ins>NCT02294227</ins>](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02294227?term=FUTURE+2&cond=Psoriatic+Arthritis&rank=4); 2015–2017\) was a 16\-week efficacy and 2\-year safety, tolerability and efficacy trial of secukinumab. **FUTURE 5** \( [<ins>NCT02404350</ins>](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02404350); 2015–2019\) investigated the efficacy \(e.g. inhibition of structural damage\), safety and tolerability of up to 2 years’ secukinumab treatment and showed overall slowing of disease progression *.* 

 **Placing secukinumab in the therapeutic armamentarium: the EXCEED clinical trial** 

 McInnes was the Chief Investigator of EXCEED \( [<ins>NCT02745080</ins>](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02745080); 2017–2019\), the first head\-to\-head monotherapy comparison of secukinumab versus a tumour necrosis factor \(TNF\) inhibitor for PsA \[3.8\]. EXCEED showed that secukinumab was at least equivalent to TNF inhibition for treating PsA articular disease and superior for managing cutaneous disease.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **The need for a new approach to treat PsA** 

 PsA is a lifelong condition that affects up to 42% of all patients with psoriasis, representing a prevalence of approximately 1% in the general population. The clinical manifestations of PsA are heterogeneous and comprise disease of the skin, nails, joints, entheses, eyes, gut and axial skeleton. Quality of life is impaired by pain, fatigue and physical disability; furthermore, cardiovascular, metabolic, psychologic and bone conditions confer substantial comorbidity. 

 Clinical management of PsA aims to target the underlying mechanisms of disease manifestation in each tissue type, with the goal to improve symptoms, abrogate damage and ultimately achieve clinical remission \(or at least minimal disease activity\). Treatment options for PsA have traditionally included non\-steroidal anti\-inflammatory drugs; corticosteroids; disease\-modifying anti\-rheumatic drugs \(DMARDs\), with methotrexate as the first\-line choice; and TNF inhibitors. Nonetheless, over half of all patients who receive these interventions remain with active PsA and poor quality of life. 

 Identification of IL\-17A as a therapeutic target for PsA and the advent of a specific IL\-17A inhibitor \(secukinumab\) delivered a novel solution to this problem. Supported by McInnes’ translational science, clinical research and clinical trials leadership, secukinumab has rapidly become widely used as a first\-choice biologic agent, thereby providing benefits for Novartis, clinical practice and patients. 

 **Benefits for Novartis** 

 Secukinumab \(trade name, Cosentyx\) was developed by Novartis, one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies in terms of total revenue. Since 2010, McInnes has been a key consultant for Novartis in the disease area of rheumatology \[5.A\]. He co\-led the company’s Global Steering Committee \(approximately six members\); served on the Global Scientific Oversight Committee; and joined the Global Scientific Discovery Advisory Board in March 2020. The strength of this relationship for the PsA development programme is highlighted by the Novartis Global Brand Medical Director: “ *Together through the academic/Novartis partnership with Prof McInnes we have been able to see that secukinumab is becoming a leading medication within Novartis and the preferred treatment option for individuals suffering from PsA in the US*” \[5.A\]. 

 *Worldwide approval of secukinumab as a treatment for PsA* 

 The phase 2a, FUTURE 1 and FUTURE 2 studies \[3.2–3.4\] provided key evidence that enabled Novartis to apply to regulatory authorities worldwide regarding an extension of indication for secukinumab to include PsA, making this drug the first IL\-17A inhibitor available for treating active disease: 

-  The European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) approved this indication in October 2015, stating secukinumab should be used “ *alone or in combination with methotrexate … when the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate*” \[5.B\]. 

-  The US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) approved the use of secukinumab among adults with active PsA in January 2016 \[5.C\]. 

-  Secukinumab has now been approved for PsA in more than 80 countries worldwide \(see Novartis  [<ins>2018 Annual Report</ins>](https://www.novartis.com/sites/www.novartis.com/files/novartis-annual-report-2018-en.pdf); p.40\). 

-  In 2018, FUTURE 5 formed the basis for EMA approval of a label update to include secukinumab dosing flexibility up to 300 mg \[5.D\]. 

 *Supporting uptake of secukinumab in the clinical management of PsA* 

 McInnes participated in the design and development of detailed post hoc evaluations to help Novartis maximise uptake of secukinumab for PsA. This suite of analyses \(published November 2013–June 2019\) used a variety of clinical outcome tools and statistical methods, including matching adjusted indirect comparisons, to investigate patient\-reported outcomes; quality\-of\-life measures; and the relative value of secukinumab versus other biologic agents \[5.E\]. These studies also introduced an autoinjector for ease of use \(well tolerated by 93% of patients\) and demonstrated very low immunogenic risk \(<1%\), enabling monotherapeutic use in clinical practice. The post hoc evaluations therefore supported the introduction of secukinumab in PsA, and provided evidence for ease of use, longevity of response and clinical utility. In addition, the EXCEED trial \[3.8\] demonstrated unequivocally that secukinumab offers at least equivalent efficacy to a TNF inhibitor for articular PsA and superior benefits in cutaneous PsA. 

 *Global sales position secukinumab as a blockbuster drug* 

 The foregoing paved the way for a second IL\-17A inhibitor \(ixekizumab; Eli Lilly\), which is now approved by the FDA \(December 2017\) and the EMA \(January 2018\); however, there is currently no generic competition to secukinumab. Consequently, marketing extensions for PsA have provided considerable economic value to Novartis in terms of worldwide sales of secukinumab for all approved indications \(PsA, psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis\) \[5.F\]. The Novartis 2020 Annual Report ranked secukinumab first in global net sales for the Innovative Medicines Division \(USD4 billion\), with USD2.5 billion recorded in the USA and USD1.5 billion in the rest of the world. By contrast, secukinumab was ranked eighth in 2016, with global net sales of USD1.1 billion \(USA: USD765 million; rest of world: USD363 million\). From January 2016 to December 2020, Novartis accrued a total of USD13.6 billion in net sales of secukinumab worldwide \[5.F\]. 

 **Benefits for clinical practice** 

 *Clinical guidelines recommend secukinumab for the treatment of PsA* 

 The European League Against Rheumatism \(EULAR\) and US\-based Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis \(GRAPPA\) develop the dominant clinical guidelines used by the rheumatology community worldwide. In 2015, both EULAR and GRAPPA included secukinumab in their PsA treatment charts for the first time, recommending its use alone or in combination among patients with poor or no response to conventional therapy with DMARDs and TNF inhibition \[5.G\]. The 2019 update to the EULAR recommendations for the management of PsA with pharmacological therapies \(McInnes, Steering Group member\) placed secukinumab as \(1\) an optional first\-choice biologic after methotrexate failure \(equal weighting to TNF inhibitors\) and \(2\) the preferred IL\-17 inhibitor above TNF inhibition for patients with a particular cutaneous disease burden \[5.G\]. In 2017, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) published a technology appraisal guideline for the treatment of PsA after inadequate response to DMARDs \(TA445\) \[5.G\] that cites FUTURE 2 \[3.3\]. NICE guideline recommendations inform clinical practice in the NHS. 

 *Secukinumab confirmed as a cost\-effective treatment for PsA* 

 Health economic analyses conducted in the UK, Canada and Finland \(2018\) demonstrated that secukinumab is a cost\-effective option for health systems caring for patients with active PsA not previously treated with any conventional therapy \[5.H\]. 

 **Benefits for patients** 

 Regulatory approvals and clinical guideline recommendations have provided access to secukinumab for patients worldwide who are living with active PsA. For example, community prescribing data from 13 of the 14 Scottish health boards demonstrates an increase in the cumulative number of PsA patients treated with secukinumab from \[text removed for publication\] in September 2015 to \[text removed for publication\] in November 2019 \[5.I\]. However, the total number of patients treated during this timeframe is likely to be higher given that community prescribing data do not capture individuals receiving secukinumab in clinical trials. 

 Treatment with secukinumab offers affected individuals symptom relief; slowing of disease progression \(e.g. joint damage at 1 year abrogated among >80% of patients, leading to improved mobility\); and protection from comorbidity, all of which can translate into improved quality of daily living. Joint pain is one of the main factors affecting quality of life among patients with PsA, causing fatigue, poor physical functioning, and societal and economic burdens such as absences from work. FUTURE 2 showed that secukinumab rapidly reduced pain \(week 4 versus pre\-treatment levels\), with the benefits sustained at 2 years \[3.6\]. In addition, over 80% of patients have improvements in self\-reported bodily pain scores and 27% achieve pain\-free life at 2 years. Concerning patient convenience and treatment adherence, secukinumab was originally administered intravenously every 2 weeks. Changing the mode of delivery to a self\-administered subcutaneous autoinjector devised by Novartis—used every 4 weeks and tested successfully in FUTURE 3 \[3.7\]—has enabled people to take more control in managing their disease. Patients have reported high levels of satisfaction with the autoinjector, considering it both easy and painless to use. 

 As secukinumab shows high efficacy for alleviation of the skin and joint symptoms of PsA, it is now considered a pivotal component of emerging treat\-to\-target \(T2T\) recommendations. T2T is a clinical strategy whereby treatment is escalated to achieve a prespecified target state \(e.g. minimal disease activity\). The T2T approach is supported by both EULAR and GRAPPA. McInnes serves on a taskforce that comprises rheumatologists from Europe and North America with experience in clinical research, as well as patient and healthcare professional representatives. This taskforce published a set of updated evidence\-based recommendations for T2T in 2018 \[5.J\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Researchers from the University of South Wales \(USW\) created a suite of statistical tools that formed a central component of the intellectual property of a high\-growth start\-up company, RUMM Ltd. The company approached university statisticians to develop new real time data analysis methods to improve their energy management software and strengthen their competitive advantage. The USW research improved the data\-analytics capability of the company, critically leading to new intellectual property which underpinned the acquisition of the company by a major British energy supplier, RWE npower Ltd in March 2015, generating significant economic and environmental impacts, through client cost savings and a reduction in carbon emissions across the UK. The research also contributed to economic regeneration in the deprived communities in the South Wales valleys through the training and upskilling of employees and the reinvestment of shareholder income into new start\-up companies.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The initial interest at the University in time series forecasting of energy usage began with a collaboration between the University of Glamorgan \(now University of South Wales\) and South Wales Electricity Board \(SWALEC\). SWALEC, one of the 12 electricity and supply distribution companies privatised in 1990 and serving the South Wales region, sought academic partners to assist in improving their understanding of patterns of electricity demand. Prof Alan **Ryley** and Prof Jamal **Ameen**, both based in Mathematical Sciences at the University, jointly supervised Dr. Hasan **Al\-Madfai**’s doctoral thesis on weather corrected electricity demand forecasting \[3.1\] which was supported by Senior Economists at SWALEC. The general approach involved the analysis of time series, specifically extracting patterns from energy demand measured at discrete moments in time and thus using them as forecasting tools. In particular, two novel time series modelling approaches were introduced and developed as part of this research project; profiles ARIMA \(based on the widely used time series forecasting method AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average\) and a variability decomposition method, with the former utilizing an event\-driven Hierarchical Profiling Approach \(HPA\) in which different elements of energy usage were divided into deterministic profiles and stochastic components. 

 **Al\-Madfai** was subsequently appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics at the University in 2002 replacing **Ryley** within the Mathematical Sciences group, and in the following years, along with other co\-authors, continued to develop the HPA method and its applications to numerous data sets, including crime forecasting \[3.2\], air pollution from carbon monoxide emissions \[3.3\] and further energy usages \[3.4\]. This expertise resulted in a collaboration with two engineers, Dr. Steve Lloyd and Mr. Steve Thomas from the University whose interests in energy usage by medium\-sized enterprises led to the establishment of RUMM Ltd \(Remote Utility Monitoring and Management\), a spin\-out company from the University launched in 2005 to provide significant savings in energy, cost and carbon emissions to manufacturing and utility sectors. **Al\-Madfai**’s pre\-existing interest in energy management enabled the identification of a weakness in the data analysis of RUMM. A comparison of the information needs of effective energy management against the existing and widely used methods identified a failure to detect irregular behaviour in datasets measured in a time domain rather than a frequency domain, partly due to then\-current benchmark time series methods having been developed on the assumption that errors are homoskedastic \(that is, the variance of the error term in the regression model is constant\). The customer data obtained by RUMM revealed electricity demand time series that were heavily influenced by the presence of multiple seasonalities and heteroskedasticity, and therefore requiring a bespoke approach to the calculation of prediction limits for the detection of usage behaviour patterns for energy management. 

 To develop the statistical tools necessary to analyse the large data sets obtained by RUMM Ltd, an EPSRC CASE award was granted and held between the University and RUMM \[3a\]. The award funded a PhD student, who was appointed in 2008 and based in the Mathematical Sciences group, resulting in the award of a doctoral degree in 2013 \[3.5\]. The doctoral study focussed on the development of an analytical technique capable of detecting irregular behaviour on half\-hourly time series which were under the influence of multiple seasonalities and heteroskedasticities. These two goals were requirements of the data held by RUMM, where data from its business users were collected at discrete and regular moments in time and analysed to detect unusual patterns and identify a cause of any unusual activity. To achieve the project aims, the HPA method, which had not been developed to model heteroskedasticity nor previously been applied to time series having multiple seasonal components, was extended from forecasting to the field of process control, the novel Generalised HPA method. This modified time series method was incorporated into a procedure to detect irregular consumption before and after a change in use was made, determining the significance of the numbers of observations falling outside the prediction limits of the Generalised HPA, and thus leading a process control tool that improved RUMM’s energy management methodology. Due to commercial sensitivity, this work was embargoed for a period of 2 years from its completion \[5.3\]. Thus, the statistical methodology, initially developed by **Al\-Madfai** alongside **Ryley** and **Ameen**, and then later by a research student, formed a central component of RUMM’s intellectual property.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Background to RUMM Ltd and collaboration with USW** 

 RUMM Ltd \[5.1\] was a new company launched in South Wales by engineering lecturers, Dr Steve Lloyd and Mr Steve Thomas, as a spin\-out company from the University in 2005 following a collaborative project with local companies to remotely monitor their energy consumption. The unique service offered by RUMM was aimed at medium\-sized businesses, benchmarking their energy usage against critical parameters and the subsequent application of statistical process control techniques to reduce their energy bills and their carbon footprint. These savings aided the businesses in achieving targets in the wake of deregulation of the energy supply infrastructure in the UK and the increased political drivers for carbon reduction. 

 RUMM’s technology provided a remote assessment of each client’s energy use, typically using between 20\-60 meters per site that measured energy consumption at key locations. Time series data from each meter was transmitted to RUMM’s server in 30\-minute intervals where it was automatically analysed using RUMM’s proprietary software package, Internet Based Analytical Software Suite \(IBASS\). IBASS provided the client with a visualisation of energy consumption and targets of energy consumption using data analytics. Automatic alarms were sent to the users whenever a meter identified an abnormally high energy use. For example, an alarm would be triggered by a machine being left on outside of normal operating hours. However, the analysis of the time series data in IBASS, which was central to the RUMM model’s ability to detect inconsistent behaviour was identified by the company as basic; it simply compared energy usage in successive half\-hourly intervals in a rudimentary manner and lacked any sophistication to deal with changes in demand due, for example, to seasonal differences. To generate the greatest possible savings in energy consumption and carbon emissions, the company sought a collaboration with the University to improve its energy management methodology. 

 **Pathway to impact** 

 In 2006 RUMM approached Al\-Madfai to develop the advanced statistical tools they needed to improve the analysis of their clients’ energy and utility data, and management of usage.  Following the identification of the presence of multiple seasonalities and heteroskedasticity in RUMM’s clients’ data, Al\-Madfai and the company submitted a collaborative bid for funding from the EPSRC for an Industrial CASE PhD Studentship \[3a\] \(titled Detecting Irregular Energy Consumption Through Analytical Techniques \(DICTAT\)\), which was awarded in 2008. Akinbami Akinwale was recruited to the project as the research student, to build on **Al\-Madfai**’s own PhD work \[3.1\] to develop an analytical technique that could be used as an energy management tool in detecting irregular behaviour of a time series \[3.5\]. To achieve this, the Hierarchal Profiling Approach \(HPA\) originally developed by **Al\-Madfai, Ryley** and **Ameen** and extended from 2002 by **Al\-Madfai** and co\-workers, was extended further. Process control techniques were developed to detect abnormalities extracted from RUMM’s time series data that identified “non\-standard” consumption profiles, while accounting for the seasonalities and variabilities embedded within the data \( [https://youtu.be/xs1YboaQhT8](https://youtu.be/xs1YboaQhT8)\). This enabled development of a remote monitoring and alarming system for the detection of irregular consumption patterns. With research outcomes having contributed to continuous upskilling of RUMM staff and to upgrades to IBASS, the statistical tools utilising HPA completed by **Al\-Madfai** and co\-workers formalised the toolkit as a key component of RUMM Ltd’s intellectual property and its competitive advantage from 2013 onwards. The intellectual property in the results of this research project were assigned to the company on the 31st March 2015 in a legal agreement \[5.2a\] to allow the company to incorporate them into IBASS Version 6 \[5.2b\] as a key part of a commercial deal with a major energy provider RWE npower. RUMM continued to deliver services supported by IBASS until 2019 when the company was fully subsumed into the new parent company. 

 **Impact: Acquisition of RUMM by RWE npower** 

 By the end of year trading on 31<sup>st</sup> August 2014, RUMM Ltd had an annual turnover of approximately £1.3 million, generating £200 000 pre\-tax profit \[5.3\]. On 31<sup>st</sup> March 2015, RUMM was purchased by RWE npower Ltd \[5.4\], known as one of the “Big Six UK Energy Suppliers” and a subsidiary of E.ON UK from January 2019. The statistical analysis and control tools developed by **Al\-Madfai** and co\-workers formed a central component of the company’s intellectual property. To quote Mr. Steve Thomas \(the commercial director of RUMM Ltd\) on its sale to npower, “If Hasan \[ **Al\-Madfai**\] wasn’t there, it couldn’t have been done” \[5.5\]. 

 At the point of acquisition, RUMM was reported to have saved its customers £43 million in energy costs, reduced energy consumption by 600 million kWh with a concomitant reduction of carbon emissions by almost 300 000 tonnes \[5,1, 5.6\].  RWE npower paid \[text removed for publication\] for RUMM \[5.7\], and immediately began rolling out RUMM’s energy\-saving approaches to its customers in the second quarter of 2015. 

 **Impact: ongoing benefits of RUMM to RWE npower and its UK clients** 

 Following the acquisition of RUMM by RWE npower, RUMM became part of npower’s Business Solutions suite of packages, under its “Energy HQ” umbrella \[5.8\], which continues to be offered to its customers. Later in 2015, RWE npower became the first power utility to be awarded the Carbon Trust triple standard for significant reduction measures across energy, waste and water, with the acquisition of RUMM cited as one of “\[two\] key developments that led to certification” \[5.9\]. Npower’s Low Carbon & Behaviour Change EMS Manager reported of RUMM a year after acquisition: “It’s already produced clear and proven benefits for firms, big and small, saving businesses we have worked with over £26m” \[5.10\], demonstrating the value to npower of the IP purchased. It was anticipated by npower’s Chief Executive that by rolling out RUMM’s technology across its customers, £4 billion could be saved from the UK’s annual fuel bill for businesses across its 23 000 commercial customers \[5.6\]. Npower targeted savings of between 3\-15% for each of its customers through its focus on “RUMM’s behavioural approach to energy” \[5.10\]. 

 **Impact: upskilling of employees** 

 A key philosophy of RUMM Ltd was the upskilling of its employees. Based in Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly County Borough, RUMM’s 30 employees \[5.6\] were predominantly drawn from local communities that display poor educational achievements and high overall deprivation, and the majority of staff were appointed to positions requiring high technical skill sets. The 2019 Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation \( [Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation \(WIMD\) 2019: results report \(gov.wales\)](https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/statistics-and-research/2019-11/welsh-index-multiple-deprivation-2019-results-report-024.pdf)\) identified Caerphilly County as the 4th most education deprived and 5<sup>th</sup> most employment deprived local authority of 22 in Wales \(by percentage of Lower Layer Super Output Areas in the 50% most deprived such areas\). As a result of the development of the HPA method and its incorporation into IBASS, a number of RUMM’s <ins>staff were upskilled</ins> in their statistical knowledge \[5.5\], <ins>adding further commercial value to the company</ins> \(as evidenced by RUMM Ltd’s sale price \[5.7\]\) and reducing both employment and educational deprivation in the region. Further, a former research student working within RUMM subsequently became a director, and post\-sale developed Blue Sky Equity Ltd \(see below\), exemplifying, through the collaboration, the research\-driven development at USW of entrepreneurship skills of students and staff. 

 **Impact: investments from profit generation** 

 Shareholders’ income from the sale of RUMM Ltd has led to further new company starts and investments in start\-up companies from 2015 to 2020. One example is the bio\-technology company Blood Line Ltd \[5.11\], founded in 2017 by two of the ex\-RUMM directors to develop technological aids for people with diabetes, making use of statistical techniques to model relationships between food intake, exercise, and key biometric parameters. Further examples include investments in the four companies by another ex\-director of RUMM, including Blue Sky Equity Ltd which was established to specifically invest in start\-up companies \[5.12\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Newcastle University research on the prioritisation and management of invasive alien species \(IAS\) has impacted on national, European and global actions to achieve Aichi Global Biodiversity Target 9 and guided over £30m of national and international programmes to protect threatened native species from the consequences of IAS.  Newcastle’s risk management methodology is incorporated into GB policy, and has guided management in Europe, USA, the Caribbean and Australia.  Newcastle research now forms part of recommended global best practice, supports species listing under EU Regulations which place management responsibilities on Member States, and informs UK government enquiries on national IAS policy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 IAS are recognised as one of the five main drivers of declines in global biodiversity. Managing the effects of these species is a great societal challenge for the 21<sup>st</sup> century, reflected in the UN Convention on Biological Diversity’s \(CBD\) Aichi Global Biodiversity Target 9, the UN Sustainable Development Goal 15, together with associated EU legislation \(Regulation EU1143/2014\).  Together, these commit signatories to prevent further introductions and significantly reduce the impacts of IAS, and control or eradicate priority species.  The delivery of these commitments carries significant economic and social costs at a global scale. 

 The scale of the challenge is large. For example, over 60,000 species have become established within the EU with taxa spanning terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments.  A further 40\-60 species establish in the EU each year, meaning that the scale of the challenge greatly outweighs the resources available to manage their impacts.  The prioritisation of management action is key, but the framework necessary to effectively balance benefits, costs and feasibility has been lacking.  We developed a novel multi\-criteria methodology to evaluate the feasibility of IAS management that can be applied across multiple taxa and environments \( **R1**\) and which directly addresses this need for prioritisation.  This methodology combines the use of published evidence and expert elicitation to consider the effectiveness, practicality, cost, acceptability, and wider impact of management in a structured framework to produce an overall ranked assessment of feasibility.  When used in combination with existing risk assessment approaches, the cost\-effective prioritisation of species for management is greatly improved.  Newcastle have worked with government policy officials to apply this methodology at both national \( **R1**\) and continental scales \( **R2**\) to prioritise IAS management. 

 IAS impact on the ecosystems they enter and interact with the native species therein.  Managing these impacts requires an understanding of species interactions, together with how the IAS may be influenced by human intervention.  Key original papers by Newcastle researchers demonstrated the interactive effects of IAS on threatened native species, using the first ecological applications of individual based modelling in real landscapes to describe the effects of predation \( **R3**\) and disease mediated competition \( **R4, G1**\).  Newcastle research has also described how the cost and effectiveness of management are influenced by the scale of these programmes \( **R5\)**. By combining ecological modelling with the dynamics of management, these methods have been applied in collaboration with practitioners to provide the ecological understanding to guide many current IAS impact management programmes, including the first global programme aiming to remove an IAS at a continental scale \( **R6, G2**\) 

 Newcastle directly engages, advises and partners with the key bodies involved in IAS policy and management at national \(GB Non\-native Species Secretariat, Animal and Plant Health Agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, UK Environmental Audit Committee\), continental \(European Commission; **G3**\) and global levels \(International Union for the Conservation of Nature, Convention on Biological Diversity\).  Through partnerships, advice, committee membership and scientific evidence this work contributes to global activities to deliver Aichi Global Biodiversity Target 9 and UN Sustainable Development Goals.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Newcastle research has provided the method used by many nations for prioritising IAS management, and which has been proposed as best practice by the Convention on Biological Diversity.  Aichi Global Biodiversity Target 9 requires signatory nations to control or eradicate priority IAS.  While methods exist to describe the scale of the problem posed by a species \(Risk Assessment\), prioritisation also needs to include whether management is feasible \(Risk Management\), considering whether it will be effective, acceptable, affordable, practical, and its wider environmental impacts.  However, an effective tool to deliver risk management for IAS that can be used across different taxa and environments has been lacking. This issue was recognised in The GB Non\-Native Species Strategy \(2015\) which included a target to ‘Further develop the risk analysis mechanism to support strategic prioritisation of resources, in particular through developing a risk management tool \(which incorporates cost/benefit analysis\)’.  This target was met by the publication of Booy et al \(2017\), which describes a method that has now been adopted by government as the GB Non\-native Risk Management \(NNRM\) scheme. The value of this process is described in a supporting letter from The GB Chief Non\-Native Species Officer, who notes that it has “directly contributed to policy and practical management decision making in GB and Europe” \( **S1**\). 

 The Aichi Target commitments, reflected in national legislation, have produced a global need for an effective IAS risk management tool which is met by the Booy et al \(2017\) method. The method has subsequently been applied by nations around the world. The Belgian government authorities who have used it describe the research as “instrumental to shaping policy decisions and on the ground management of IAS” in Belgium and the EU, with the approach described as “exemplary and inspirational from a science policy perspective” \( **S2**\) The Newcastle method was effective in informing Belgian policy: it identified the “necessary budget for eradication \(minimally €86m\) and spread limitation \(€11\-96m\) for the set of IAS of the Regulation in Flanders.”\( **S2**\). The method was also applied at a continental scale, via a Newcastle\-led European workshop to inform the European Commission’s selection of Species of Union Concern \( **R2**\).   Newcastle staff co\-ordinate the management content of the existing European Commission IAS Risk Assessment process which underpins the listing of Species of Union Concern under EU Regulation 1143/2014 \( **S3, G3**\). Since its establishment in 2014, the EU list now contains 66 species and places management responsibilities on all Member States.  Beyond Europe, the Newcastle method has been applied by Biosecurity Queensland in Australia to prioritise management of more than 300 pest plants and animals in the \~2 million km<sup>2</sup> area of the State of Queensland, and who describe the Newcastle research as “ground\-breaking” \( **S4**\). It has been applied in the UK Overseas Territories in Anguilla and The Turks and Caicos Islands to identify species for priority eradication to protect local endemic species \( **S5\).** This identified a total of 99 species from these territories which were assessed for eradication, with 22 identified as having a high or very high feasibility of success, and three eradication plans subsequently produced \( **S5**\).  The US Geological Survey has applied the Newcastle method for IAS management in California, describing how it “effectively resolves” many existing problems, resulting in “immediate strategic planning to remove introduced beaver” and the ability to “allocate funds and prioritise management of non\-native species within …. the Natural Communities Conservation Planning \(NCCP\) program” \( **S6**\). 

 This risk management approach is also being recommended as global best practice through the Convention on Biological Diversity.  In 2017, the CBD Secretariat formed a Technical Expert Group on the development of IAS management tools and guidance. Newcastle staff \( **Robertson**\) convened the preparatory on\-line forum on the costs and effectiveness of IAS management and presented our approach to risk management in Montreal in 2019.  The Technical Expert Group then proposed the use of the Booy et al \(2017\) multi\-criteria approach as best practice for risk\-based IAS prioritisation \( **S7**\). 

 Subsequently, CBD published their Global Biodiversity Outlook 2020 which reported progress to achieve Aichi Global Biodiversity Target 9.  The summary highlighted ‘the progress in prioritising IAS species in terms of the risk they present, as well as in the feasibility of managing them \(Booy et al 2017\), directly contributing to progress towards this global target.’ \( **S8**\). 

 As well as producing a framework to prioritise management, Newcastle research also supports and guides individual large\-scale IAS management programmes, influencing several major international eradication programmes.  Since 2000 at least 35 Newcastle publications have dealt directly with the large\-scale management of IAS \( **S9**, **R5**\).  These include the largest global IAS eradication yet attempted; the management of the invasive ruddy duck across Europe.  This programme aims to protect the white\-headed duck, which, when the programme started, was the most threatened breeding bird species in Europe. This programme was highlighted as a successful case study in the CBD Global Biodiversity Outlook 2020 \( **S8**\), based on our research \( **R6**\). This process of combining ecological modelling with the dynamics of intervention has also been applied to other large scale programmes such as the management of grey squirrels to protect the native red squirrels, including grey squirrel eradication from Anglesey and subsequent recolonization by the threatened native red squirrel.  A further example is the protection of ground nesting birds in the Hebrides from the effects of the invasive American mink **\(R5\)**. Newcastle staff currently have advisory roles in major projects managing invasive species in Orkney \(PAR\) and the Uists \(AM\). Together these IAS management projects have an estimated value in excess of £30m \( **S9**\). 

 Newcastle expertise and experience also contributes to UK national policy on IAS.  Evidence presented by Newcastle staff to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee Enquiry on Invasive Species \(2019\) proposed increased resources, an increased focus on preventative actions, and new capabilities such as an IAS Inspectorate, recommendations supported by the Committee who appreciated the “quality” of the input \( **S1 and 10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Leonardi’s research and expertise onR1 South Sudan have led to wide\-ranging impacts in the following areas: 

-  on customary authority and local justice in South Sudan, influencing the design and documentary outputs of an EU\-funded project on access to justice, and a Swiss\-funded project on customary authorities in the country. 

-  a research network on South Sudanese museum artefacts, which has contributed to increasing awareness of South Sudanese cultural heritage among European museum curators and a range of heritage, arts and culture professionals and community representatives in the UK and South Sudan. 

-  research on land governance and boundary disputes, which has informed UK government and other international policy\-making on governance, justice, land and boundary issues in South Sudan and neighbouring countries, as evidenced in widespread citation and use of her research in policy\-oriented documents. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The foundation for the impact is Leonardi’s research since 2001 on the historical and contemporary role of chiefs \(known as ‘traditional’ or ‘customary’ authorities\) in governance and justice in South Sudan \(R1\-R4\). This work contested both academic and non\-academic understandings of chiefs as either static, primordial forms of indigenous authority or the despotic creations of colonial governments. Instead, it argued for the intermediary role of chiefship in state\-society relations and its resilience as a local government and judicial institution. In the context of South Sudan’s secession in 2011, Leonardi’s research challenged widespread assumptions that the new state represented a clean slate, by highlighting the longstanding local\-level state institutions and practices inherited by the independent government. 

 New research since 2013 has developed in two principal directions. The first extends the focus from customary authority to the broader meaning and value of South Sudanese custom and culture. This research has been pursued collaboratively with Zoe Cormack \(Oxford\), through an AHRC\-funded International Research Network on South Sudanese museum collections in Europe, which brought together curators from museums holding significant collections of objects from South Sudan with international academic researchers, heritage practitioners and community representatives from South Sudan and its diaspora. The network discussions have been disseminated online through workshop reports, blogs and a collection inventory, raising key issues regarding the potential of museum objects and other cultural heritage to generate new understandings of history, inter\-community relations and identity. Unlike much research and commentary on South Sudan, this work focuses on the country’s cultural assets rather than only on its needs and deficits. Similarly, Leonardi’s work has informed and contributed to a major research project coordinated by the Rift Valley Institute \(RVI\) in South Sudan with Swiss government funding, which has highlighted the value of history, custom and cultures of dialogue in a context in which conflict and humanitarian crisis tend to obscure the longer\-term, local\-level resilience that Leonardi’s work has consistently revealed. Her 2019 overview report for this project also reiterates the longstanding emphasis of her research on the political, military and economic brokerage role of chiefs \(R1\), which has implications for engagement with them by international organisations. 

 Secondly, Leonardi’s research on the role of chiefs in governing land and natural resources has led to new work on local forms of territoriality, boundary disputes and land governance, funded firstly by the international foundation Gerda Henkel Stiftung. A 50,000\-word original research report in the RVI Contested Borderlands series \(R5\) was disseminated at public lectures in South Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, London and Washington DC. The findings revealed the rapidly changing value of land and the challenges this poses to customary land governance in South Sudan and northern Uganda, ideas which were further developed in the introduction to a special issue of *Critical African Studies* on ‘Valuing Land in Eastern Africa’ edited by Leonardi with Adrian Browne. Leonardi’s own research focused on the long history of a disputed area of the South Sudan\-Uganda border \(R5, R6\), where she also returned for further research in 2017 as Co\-I on an AHRC/ESRC PaCCS Inter\-disciplinary Research Innovation on Conflict project on '“Witchcraft” and conflict: Exploring alternative discourses of insecurity’. This body of work challenges prevailing understandings of state territoriality and security, by demonstrating the importance of local, often hybrid, government institutions in asserting territorial boundaries and managing land disputes. A particular cause of such disputes and a driver of change in customary land tenure is urbanisation, which Leonardi has also examined in relation to access to fuelwood around South Sudan’s rapidly expanding capital, as Co\-I on the ESRC/DfID Development Frontiers project ‘Energy on the Move’ \(2017\-18\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  1. Influence on internationally\-funded projects in South Sudan: 

 a\) EU\-funded Access to Justice in South Sudan project implemented by the British Council, supporting capacity\-building work with chiefs’ courts, which are the primary local judicial institutions in South Sudan. Leonardi has acted as expert advisor to the project since 2013, playing a key role in shaping its focus, approach and research methods. Her research findings on chiefs’ courts are cited in project presentations to donors and were summarised in planning documents which ‘ **\[REDACTED\]**’ \(E1\) By mid\-2020, the project had engaged with 45 customary courts, involving approximately 700 chiefs, 100 court clerks, and 1,600 community representatives. Approximately 2,800 customary court cases had been observed in the courts \(E1\). Leonardi was approached again in 2020 to advise on ‘legacy’ strategies for archiving, analysing and publishing the wealth of court data gathered, and she will review written outputs in 2021. 

 b\) Swiss\-funded South Sudan Customary Authorities project \(2015\-present\) implemented by the Rift Valley Institute \(RVI\). The project cited Leonardi’s research in a Phase III project proposal in 2016 and employed her as a consultant between 2018 and 2019. She gave a public lecture at the Catholic University in Juba during a forum bringing together chiefs and youth in June 2018, and provided input to a project review in early 2019. She produced an overview report, *Making Order out of Disorder: Customary Authority in South Sudan*, which drew on her own research and synthesised a series of research outputs from the project, most of which also cited her work on the nature of chiefly authority. **\[REDACTED\]** \(E2\). 

####  2. Increasing awareness of South Sudanese cultural heritage: 

 Leonardi’s research on the violent and extractive nature of early commercial and imperial encounters, combined with Zoe Cormack’s research on South Sudanese material culture and museum collections, generated the AHRC\-funded South Sudan Museum Network to explore the history and value of objects taken from the region to Europe in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. This network brought together museum curators from across Europe for the first time to consider the connections and significance of their holdings from South Sudan, resulting in a new inventory of these collections and a forthcoming open\-access, illustrated publication highlighting key objects. The network workshops enabled South Sudanese participants to explain and debate the contentious histories of museum objects and displays. 

 According to the network partner, the Pitt Rivers Museum \(PRM\), the meetings enabled its curatorial staff ‘to engage closely with colleagues from all over Europe on collections and their stake holder communities, and facilitated many follow up communications and research directions. The network was vital in establishing a further network of South Sudanese Diaspora members living in the UK, who were invited to come to the PRM in November 2018 to view collections and take part in a film training course. As part of this course, the community group made a film which summarized their feelings about museum collections for the diaspora community, ‘Exploring our South Sudanese Identity at the Pitt Rivers Museum’. Dr Zoe Cormack, the network’s Co\-I, took a lead role in this work as a current Research Affiliate of the Museum. The diaspora group’s visit was timed to coincide with another initiative that arose directly from the AHRC network’s activity, being a Mellon Foundation funded Global South Visiting Professorship at the University of Oxford in 2018 for Jok Madut Jok, one of the network’s participants. This successful set of initiatives led to a further Diaspora group visit to the PRM in Feb 2020, with an expanded number of community participants from different parts of the UK. The network and its ongoing impact have therefore been instrumental in fostering and developing a range of museum\-community relations both in South Sudan and in the UK \(E3\). 

 Another network member also initiated the relabeling of objects in the British Museum catalogue from ‘Sudanese’ to ‘South Sudanese’. The final workshop held in collaboration with UNESCO in Juba, South Sudan, raised awareness of the European collections among South Sudanese government, heritage and arts and culture personnel, as well as providing a forum to debate the future of museums in the new country. It led to further work by Cormack and a key network participant advising UNESCO over a potential World Heritage Site in South Sudan. The network website disseminates information and resources, with a total of 7,156 views between 2017 and 2020, and 1,412 Twitter followers. 

####  3. Informing UK government and other international policy\-making on governance and boundary issues in South Sudan: 

 Leonardi’s research and expertise has been cited and consulted by UK and other international agencies, policy\-makers and practitioners, through a range of dissemination and advisory channels. While it is difficult to demonstrate specific policy change as a result, there is considerable evidence of key contributions to the information base used by policy\-makers. Leonardi’s publications are cited in many policy reports and briefs. For example, a special feature on South Sudan in the ODI publication *Humanitarian Exchange* included a call for international actors to ‘fundamentally rethink our timeframes’ and spend more time understanding South Sudanese institutions: ‘on the subject of chieftainship and customary authority, Cherry Leonardi’s book… is particularly helpful.’ In 2019 Leonardi was invited to discuss her research findings on local governance and conflict with the UN South Sudan Joint Mission Analysis Centre \(E4\). 

 The Conflict Sensitivity Resource Facility for South Sudan, funded jointly by the UK, Switzerland, Canada and the Netherlands and implemented by Saferworld and swisspeace, also includes Leonardi’s publications in its repository and monthly briefings, and cites them in several of its own policy briefs on governance, housing, land and property and conflict sensitivity guidance. The swisspeace focal point working on the CSRF regularly refers to Leonardi’s work in briefings and presentations to donors and policy\-makers \(E5\). 

 Leonardi’s research is cited in a draft report on South Sudan’s contested internal state boundaries for the United States Institute of Peace and Rift Valley Institute. **\[REDACTED\]** \(E6\). 

 Leonardi’s work was also used in an internal FCO brief on South Sudan’s internal boundaries, and she contributed to a workshop and the writing of a publication on decentralisation and internal boundaries by the Overseas Development Institute \(2016\), which has been heavily used by the FCO and DfID. **\[REDACTED\]** \(E7\). 

 Work on security in the South Sudan\-Uganda borderlands with J. Fisher resulted in a workshop in Uganda, organised jointly with the International Refugee Rights Initiative in 2018, to discuss the South Sudanese refugee influx into Uganda. This informed a joint submission to the UK parliamentary inquiry into forced displacement in Africa: the final report cited the submission in relation to gender issues in refugee settlements and the need to engage local community organisations and traditional leaders in refugee response \(E8\). 

 Work on borderlands also led to contributions to a report by the Governance and Social Development Research Centre, University of Birmingham, to help DfID prepare for an Ebola outbreak in South Sudan and an advisory group and workshop at the Wellcome Trust in 2019 for the Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform \(SSHAP\) work on the Ebola outbreak in DRC. She subsequently provided feedback on an SSHAP brief on cross\-border dynamics between South Sudan and DRC, in which her work on borders was also cited \(E9\). 

 Leonardi and Browne’s ‘Introduction: Valuing Land in Eastern Africa’ \( *Critical African Studies*\), drawing on Leonardi & Santschi’s research \(R5, R6\), was used by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Land and Resources Global Group, whose director attests it was ‘a good counterbalance to the more overt market orientated worldview of the valuation and surveying profession and has helped raise important issues of communal value and social cohesion’. It will inform the preparation of a Manual for the “Valuation of Unregistered Lands and Informal Property” by the UN\-Habitat Global Land Tool Network, for which Leonardi was invited to join the expert review group, and which ‘could have enormous repercussions in the acquiring of communal land and property for public and investment use’ \(E10\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A collaboration between University of Southampton historian Professor Christer Petley and performance artist Elaine Michener, *Sweet Tooth* \(2017\) is a 45\-minute performance representing the brutal realities of slavery. Choreography and score drew on archival material relating to a slaveholder, Simon Taylor \(1739\-1813\), which Petley uncovered as part of research into the history of slavery in the British Empire. Versions of *Sweet Tooth* have been showcased in a variety of settings, including places with clear historic connections to the transatlantic slave system. The premiere performance, in Liverpool, was broadcast by BBC Radio 3, and more than 530 people have attended a public showcasing of *Sweet Tooth*, in the UK and elsewhere. The project is a demonstration of the impact of historical scholarship on artistic practice, demonstrating how the two can unite to represent the past experience of slavery and its continuing legacies of violent trauma and inequality. It is a unique but inspirational example of such cross\-disciplinary exchange; and similar works, inspired by its success, have since provoked new audiences to re\-imagine the experiences and meanings of enslavement.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2007, while producing his first monograph, *Slaveholders in Jamaica* \[ **3.1**\], Petley began to focus on one of the region’s most influential and wealthy slaveholders, the Jamaican sugar planter Simon Taylor. His research drew on two sets of sources: a probate inventory held in Spanish Town, Jamaica, produced on Taylor's death in 1813, and hundreds of Taylor's letters, now held in Cambridge and London. The former was a substantial document of more than 40 folio pages, including lists of 2,248 enslaved people among Taylor's 'property', some of them recorded as of 'no value'. Taylor's letters provided a rich, unparalleled record of a slaveholder's life, including his political ideas and private thoughts. An AHRC Early Career Fellowship awarded in 2011 enabled Petley to transcribe more than 160,000 of Taylor's words. Analysis of this corpus resulted in a suite of contributions to history journals that have illuminated many facets of the 'plantocracy'/slaveholders, including slaveholder identity \[ **3.3**\], politics \[ **3.4**\], material culture and attitudes towards enslaved people \[ **3.5**\]. More recent outputs include a website showcasing excerpts from the Taylor letters, aimed at scholars, students and the general public, and a scholarly article re\-evaluating a historical landmark: the 1807 abolition of the slave trade \[ **3.6**\]. 

 The climax of this research was Petley’s book *White Fury*, published in 2018 by Oxford University Press \[ **3.2**\]—a signal contribution to the literature on British Caribbean slavery and the fall of the planter class. It draws principally on Taylor's letters and offers a new analysis of the British slave system, as well as of the political defeat of the planters at a time when revolutions in the Americas combined with abolitionism in Britain to bring about an end to the slave trade. A substantial part of the book explores the evidence from Taylor’s probate inventory, shedding new light on the lives of those enslaved people whose labour underpinned Taylor’s wealth and influence. 

 Scholarly reception of *White Fury* has been overwhelmingly favourable, with one review, by the historian Diana Paton, noting how its detailed interpretation of the Taylor archive represents a ‘lasting contribution’ to work on the ‘politics of reactionary racism in the context of the slave trade debates’. Other historians of slavery and abolition describe the book as ‘subtle, sensitive’ \(Trevor Burnard\), ‘original and provocative’, ‘revealing and persuasive’ \(James Walvin\). Richard Huzzey, writing for the Institute of Historical Research Reviews in History, describes it as ‘an exceptional book that will become a major point of reference for historians of the 18th\-century Caribbean’. The book and its findings are also of interest to an audience beyond the academy, and it has been the subject of a 'History Hit' podcast, hosted by the broadcaster Dan Snow, as well as providing material for three recent popular history articles authored by Petley.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In November 2013, Elaine Mitchener contacted Petley, after watching a BBC4 documentary on Caribbean slavery in which he appeared as an expert commentator. She was interested in creating a new piece of performance art exploring the histories of sugar, slavery and connections between Jamaica and Britain. Born in London to parents who had emigrated to Britain from Jamaica, Mitchener is a well\-known and highly regarded artist and performer. After an initial meeting in London, she and Petley continued to discuss the historical themes and creative ideas that would form *Sweet Tooth*. As that work began to take shape, they met again in London in February 2016, as well as in Southampton in December 2015 and April 2016. 

 From its inception *Sweet Tooth* drew heavily on archival documents, transcribed and interpreted by Petley during his research. As Mitchener puts it: ‘The documents became my libretto’ \[ **5.6**\]. Petley’s methods and findings also became integral to the developing piece. For instance, Petley and Mitchener discussed how Simon Taylor’s probate inventory could be used to illuminate the lives of enslaved people, despite its obvious limitations as a document representing those people as property. Petley also shared observations about how Taylor’s letters demonstrate the amplified anxiety and fury of British\-Caribbean slaveholders during the Age of Revolution, including their growing fear of slave rebellions. 

 Having helped Mitchener to devise a premise for *Sweet Tooth*, Petley became the Historical Consultant for her project, working with the group that Mitchener assembled to develop and perform the piece: instrumentalist Sylvia Hallett, percussionist Mark Sanders and saxophonist Jason Yarde. Mitchener, an experimental vocalist, was the main performer. Petley continued to provide detailed advice, offering his perspectives on how the work in progress evoked such themes as the Middle Passage and plantation labour, as well as the cultural adaptation, sexual exploitation, and resistance of enslaved people. 

 The most intensive period of creative development took place during the summer of 2016. Petley secured funding from the University of Southampton’s Public Engagement with Research Unit for a three\-day workshop, which allowed the group to meet with him at the Turner Sims concert hall between 27 and 29 June 2016. They tested ideas and showed Mitchener’s work\-in\-progress to a public audience of 24 people. Mitchener then won Arts Council England funding for the project and a prestigious residency at Aldeburgh Music, between 6 and 11 August 2016. The residency brought Petley, Mitchener and the three other performers together with acclaimed choreographer Dan van Huynh. It closed with a sharing of the work to a paying audience of 40 \[ **5.5**\]. 

 *Impact on Artists* 

 Mitchener came to the project with ‘a lay person’s knowledge’ of the history she wanted to portray. Petley’s research\-based understanding of historical themes and documentary source material was thus invaluable to *Sweet Tooth* and are woven through the work. For instance, Mitchener describes learning from Petley about how Taylor presented enslaved people in his letters as though they were pieces of machinery as ‘a mustard seed moment’—‘a real turning point’ in her creative process \[ **5.6**\]. People struggling to survive within a callously mechanistic system became a defining trope, repeatedly referenced, for example through Sanders’ percussive clanking of wood on metal, in a scene evoking the physical inspection of an enslaved person as an item to be bought, and via choreography that reflected plantation labour discipline. 

 Transcriptions from the probate inventory and from the letters appear at two key points in the finished piece. During the middle section Mitchener recites names, primary occupations, and cash valuations of enslaved people \(some of whom were listed as being ‘of no value’\) from the inventory. It is a transformative moment—the first time in the piece that words are spoken. On one level, naming people in the familiar form of a rollcall reflects a functional document that enumerated people as ‘property’. But as Mitchener remarks, her evocation of the names that were given to these enslaved people ‘reminds us of their humanity’—and she does it to ‘honour their memory’, overturning the original purpose of the list \[ **5.1**, **5.2**\]. In the final section, Mitchener recites extracts of Taylor’s letters, channelling bold mastery at first, but then, as Mitchener says, ‘there is a fear that comes up’: masterly confidence subtly melting away into anxious ‘paranoia’ \[ **5.4**\]. Increasingly agitated and fragmented speech builds against a growing cacophony of sound, offering up a performance of a slave owner’s growing fury, frustration, and fragility, as his investments are challenged by the prospect of slave rebellion. 

 *Impact on Audiences* 

 Following a further experimental showcasing as part of the 2016 Bloomsbury Festival, *Sweet Tooth* premiered at Liverpool's Bluecoat Centre for the Contemporary Arts \(audience=109\) on 23 November 2017, with subsequent performances at the Nuffield Theatre, Southampton \(audience=133\), and at the Museum of London, Docklands \(audience=79\), all of these numbers were close to, or at, full capacity for the venues. As of May 2020, more than 450 people had attended live performances of *Sweet Tooth* since its premiere \[ **5.7**, **5.8**, **5.9, 5.13**\]. A recording of the Liverpool Bluecoat performance was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 30 December 2017 \(available subsequently online\), bringing the work to many more listeners, in the UK and beyond \[ **5.2,** **5.7**\]. The international premiere of the piece, at the Borealis Festival, Bergen, Norway, on 6 March 2020 \(audience=150\), was not only the first performance of *Sweet Tooth* outside the UK but also its first at a major music festival—a signal achievement for a piece that falls outside typical genre classifications \[ **5.13**\]. 

 *Sweet Tooth* is deliberately discomfiting and has provoked strong responses from audiences. Those attending a performance commented that the piece ‘pushes the audience’. It is ‘challenging \- not comfortable listening'. Audience members attributed this to the fact that 'sound, music and historical reference \[were\] used perfectly together,' transporting them ‘to an uncomfortable but necessary space’. The reading from Petley's transcription of Taylor's probate inventory, which included references to those enslaved people who were recorded as being of 'no value' was particularly effective in this regard: 'hearing the list of names was the most powerful bit for me', noted a member of one audience, who was left 'bowled over by the thought of people with ""no value"".' Others agreed that the power of the piece owed much to the inclusion of 'chilling detail' from the archive \[ **5.4**, **5.5**\]. The Artistic Director of the Borealis Festival notes that the piece provided the audience with ‘no room for ambivalence’ and that the ‘rooting of this work in careful historical research gave it a grounding and authority to speak artistically to a very real human situation’, something that the Director of the John Hansard Gallery identifies as the outcome of a ‘rich partnership between researcher and artist’ \[ **5.13**, **5.9**\]. Mitchener also attests to the importance of that partnership, noting that, notwithstanding her work’s abstract characteristics, it is important to her that there is ‘nothing that’s made up’ \[ **5.6**\]. 

 *Impact on Institutions* 

 *Sweet Tooth* enabled a number of cultural institutions to acknowledge historical ties to the slave trade in a non\-tokenistic fashion while engaging new audiences. The piece premiered in Liverpool, at one time Britain’s biggest slaving port, at the city's Bluecoat theatre, whose 1717 building was funded by proceeds from the slave trade. The London Docklands venue was once a warehouse storing slave\-produced Caribbean sugar. According to its Artistic Director, Bluecoat ‘has the widest audience demographic of comparable cultural institutions in Liverpool,’ and the audience for *Sweet Tooth* in 2017 ranged ‘from students and academics to local history enthusiasts and people from the city’s diverse communities’ including 'new audiences'. He was struck by how ‘the authenticity of the historical elements of the piece’, such as the use of slaves’ names and the words of a real slave owner, blended with the emotional interpretation of the performers, confronting the audience at ‘both an intellectual and emotional level with a difficult past and its repercussions in the present’. The event, he emphasised, ‘helped consolidate Bluecoat’s positioning within the discursive environment around colonial legacies, locally and nationally’, topics that also framed discussion of the piece at a public event, hosted by the International Slavery Museum the day after the premiere. This aspect of the work was also important to the organisers of the Bergen Borealis Festival. There *Sweet Tooth* drew a far more ethnically diverse audience than is usual for such an event. In the words of the Artistic Director, it facilitated a public discussion about race and exclusion that ‘would not have been possible with a piece that was not itself so rooted in rigorous historical research’. \[ **5.7**, **5.13**\] 

 Mitchener has continued to apply the methods she developed with Petley to other, site\-specific commissions. On 8 July 2019, she unveiled her new set of installations for English Heritage at Portchester Castle, Hampshire, which recite parts of historical lists and letters to evoke the site’s history as a prison for captured former slaves from the French Caribbean during the Revolutionary Wars of the 1790s \[ **5.10**\]. Mitchener has also developed a stand\-alone solo piece *\[Names\]*—an extension of her work with Taylor’s probate inventory, built around her incantation of the names listed in the document. This was first performed on 16 October 2016 at the Spill Festival, Ipswich \[ **5.3**\] and subsequently exhibited as a sound installation at the John Hansard Gallery, Southampton, during November 2019. ‘The retrieval and reciting of these names’ is characterised by the Director of the Gallery as ‘an act of defiant commemoration’ \[ **5.9**\], and visitors commented that the installation was ‘poignant’, ‘heartbreaking, uncompromising’, and ‘powerfully relentless’, with one remarking that the installation ‘should be permanent’ \[ **5.12**\]. 

 *Shifting and Sharing Academic and Artistic Practice* 

 The transfer of knowledge between Petley and Mitchener was a two\-way process. Mitchener has praised Petley for embracing a process that deliberately required its participants ‘to never feel comfortable’ \[ **5.4**\]. Petley was developing his own research on Simon Taylor and Jamaican slavery during the period when Mitchener was creating *Sweet Tooth*, and his writing and interpretation were influenced by the process. For example, part of one chapter of his 2018 research monograph, *White Fury*, developed from a report on one enslaved teenager’s experience of being trafficked into Jamaica that he first wrote for Mitchener. A section of the conclusion echoes the middle part of *Sweet Tooth* by listing names, occupations, and values of enslaved people in Taylor’s inventory, and other parts of the text channel Mitchener’s inspiration in less obvious ways, seeking to evoke for readers an intimate and personalised sense of slavery’s horrors. Critical acclaim for the book as a ‘marvellously evocative’ account of its subject \(Trevor Burnard, University of Hull\) reflects the benefits to Petley of working with Mitchener. 

 *Sweet Tooth* arose from novel and innovative cross\-disciplinary methods that continue to shape Mitchener’s practice and have the potential to influence new work by other artists and performers. Because it relies in part on improvised performances and is adapted to the space of each venue, the piece remains a work in progress. It is one that has made a unique impression on all involved in its production. ‘It’s opened me up’, writes Mitchener: ‘I approach my work in a much more academic way’. One key difference of the work, according to the multi\-instrumentalist on the project, Sylvia Hallett, lies in its creative engagement with the ‘immutability’ of archival traces. It is these, Hallett reflects, that have provided the work with ‘a central core around which the stuff of imagination can weave new paths’ \[ **5.4**, **5.11**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Perry’s research and development of digital resources for heritage sites around the world has had a major impact on the presentation of the past, and on heritage professionals who curate it. At Memphis in Egypt, her research has been applied to train and inspire the next generation of heritage policy leaders, building capacity, generating measurable improvements to wellbeing and providing career advancement opportunities, with a particular focus on opportunities for women. Her approach has been cascaded to around 20 sites, transforming professional practice and fostering cultural democracy, equality, inclusion and diversity in challenging socio\-political environments. At Memphis and the World Heritage Site at Çatalhöyük, Turkey, her research has been applied to transform the presentation of the sites. Digital storytelling has been embedded in the presentation and new infrastructure has been built, enriching the visitor experience. In the UK Perry’s research has produced digital solutions and best\-practices now applied by major heritage organisations.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 York researchers have critically explored the impact of digital technologies on public engagement with heritage since 1995. However, in the past decade, as the scale of the development and implementation of these technologies has accelerated, the initial enthusiasm about their capacity to animate broad audiences has been replaced with an urgent need to evaluate and address their profound human effects – both positive and negative. From 2012 to 2019 digital heritage research at York was led by Perry, with collaborators across Europe. This research sought to understand how implementing and analysing the impacts of emotive, social, storytelling and dialogue\-based public interpretation at cultural heritage sites can foster an ‘ethic of care’ amongst visitors, promoting heritage sites as discursive spaces, through which archaeology facilitates far greater social impact \( **3.1**, **3.2**\). 

 In 2014 Perry received funding from the British Institute at Ankara \(BIAA\) to prototype visitor\- centred interpretation at Çatalhöyük, Turkey. This sought to provide visitors with richer, more personalised interpretative experiences, incorporating interactive engagement via a mobile phone app, conventional signage and replica houses, and paving the way for advances in evoking and emoting the past at similar sites globally. Further funding was awarded from the BIAA in 2015 to experiment with digital storytelling, allowing users to add content to the app, enhancing interactions through virtual/augmented reality, and evaluating the impact of these initiatives on visitors \( **3.3**, **3.4**\). 

 Following on from this second phase of work, Perry continued to research how emotionally engaging experiences are best designed and evaluated and became the York PI for the ground\-breaking EC\-funded Horizon 2020 EMOTIVE project \(2016–19\), for which she co\-designed and co\-authored the conceptual framework. This collaborative research sought to help professionals create engaging, memorable stories, and enable the public to enjoy and share these stories. It aimed to engage audiences in a new way, putting emotional stories at the heart of museums and heritage sites. The research demonstrated that drama\-based narratives which reference a site’s cultural content have the power to transform visitor experiences, encouraging repeat visits, facilitating direct and ongoing interaction and deepening knowledge transfer \( **3.1**\). Moreover, research on simple rule\-based chatbots running on mobile phones has extended these findings, demonstrating the potential for such minimal applications of technology to prompt responses from users, including recognition of prejudices leading to genuine critical reflection. For example, a visit to the Neolithic site at Çatalhöyük became the trigger for conversations between visitors about difficult topics such as death, wealth distribution, gender equality and privacy which still resonate today \( **3.5**\). Further empirically tested research \(through the EMOTIVE project\) in out\-of\-school settings with young people aged 8–16 and mixed adult groups demonstrated the capacity of such techniques to foster the three key traits of historical empathy: affective connection, historical contextualisation and perspective\-taking. 

 Perry’s research is the first of its kind to establish the significance of digital technologies for shifting traditional approaches to the presentation of cultural sites empirically and cross\-culturally – moving away from isolating didactic environments in which visitors are simply ‘informed about the past’ into places of change made possible via dialogue and socialisation.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Perry’s research into the deployment of digital heritage approaches can be directly linked to impacts on two levels: 

 **Personal impacts, capacity building, training and individual professional practice,** with significant transformation of individual wellbeing, community values and economic livelihood, fostering equality, diversity and inclusion in the profession, and empowering the next generation of heritage managers, traceable for over four years; 

 **New narrative techniques to transform management and presentation,** enhancing visitors’ sense of connection with the past, and impacting institutional practice, driving radical new strategies in professional museum and heritage management practice with national and international reach. 

####  \(1\) Personal impacts, capacity building, training and individual professional practice 

 Perry’s applications of digital media to planning, recording, archiving, design, publication, and online dissemination – and her training of others in such applications and wider heritage practice – have led to transformations in the career development of the next generation of heritage managers in Egypt with particular support for the role of women. As a result of her research, in 2015 Perry was invited to join the USAID\-funded Memphis Site and Community Development project \(MSCD\) and lead an integrated heritage interpretation and outreach training programme. The four 6\-week field schools trained 77 Ministry of Antiquities inspectors \(out of a target of 80\) in site management, heritage, media development, photography and engaging local communities. The independently commissioned USAID evaluation report showed that 92% of graduates felt that the training “increased their motivation”; 90% felt better able to “effectively deal with different job responsibilities”; and 86% noted increased self\-confidence \( **5.1**\). 

 Supporting women was a key focus of the training, in a country which traditionally offers them fewer opportunities. Of the field school participants, 62% were female and the USAID evaluation highlighted “an increased motivation among female trainees towards further studies and better career opportunities...the training program was able to support women in pursuing additional training, tasks or studies \(94.7%\), increase their self\-confidence \(86.8%\), effectively deal with different job responsibilities \(84.2%\), increase their ability to innovate and create new ideas \(76.3%\) and gain capabilities to train other colleagues \(71.1%\)”. As a result of their training 37.5% of female graduates went on to work in other international archaeological missions \( **5.1**\). 

 Evaluation undertaken at the end of the last field school echoed USAID’s findings with 86% of respondents reporting direct impacts on their career progression \( **5.2a**\), while others continued to cite specific qualitative outcomes including increased confidence, motivation and accountability, personal awakening, improved life skills and team skills, and heightened perseverance \( **5.2a**\). The feedback highlights personal impacts on female trainees, both as human beings and on how they view other people. According to one graduate: “It was a lifetime experience\! I guess I should divide my c.v. into ‘before’ and ‘after’ \[the\] MSCD project\!” Employed by the Ministry of Antiquities’ Site Management Committee to “improve the visitor experience of Egyptian archaeological sites and open closed sites for visitors”, she directly attributes her promotion to MSCD: “knowledge I gained from the project, enabled me to apply and \[get\] accepted in this position” \( **5.2a**, p.3\). Another female graduate wrote, “I’m grateful to \[the\] MSCD field school because now I don’t look at the antiquity only but I look from the other side of the human around the antiquity and their needs, ideas about the monuments” \( **5.2a**, p.14\). Follow\-up evaluation conducted in 2020 highlighted ongoing impacts of the training up to four years after completion. One female participant noted the MSCD had increased her trust in herself and her skills and helped her deal with difficult personal issues; another was explicit that “the Memphis field school was a key contributor to the success of \[her\] career in digital heritage.” Five participants reported increased confidence, leading to participation in further international training \(including a British Museum International Training Programme, a 6\-month programme at the Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro in Rome, and an international seminar on museum management in China\). Graduates wrote about the impact the training had on their careers, encouraging them to gain new heritage management qualifications and to pursue career changes, including one former curator who is now head of the microscopic documentation group of the Tutankhamun collection at the Grand Egyptian Museum \( **5.2b**\). A former trainee, and later an instructor on the field school, identified the Memphis field school as “one of the most important steps in the process of developing Egyptian archaeologists and keeping them apace with the discipline of heritage site management” \( **5.3**, p.4\). 

 Finally, the installation of 1413m of walking trails and associated interpretation media designed by Perry and the trainees to connect the Memphis monuments provided personal economic impacts for 133 local workmen and 46 local business people and craftsmen employed to undertake jobs ranging from landscaping and bricklaying to installation of signage and furniture construction \( **5.3**, p.32\). The site co\-director noted the very personal impacts of Perry’s advocacy for local collaboration: “the café owner’s smile at seeing his café labelled on the new brochure, the bazaar owners' joy at seeing the new panels” \( **5.3**, p.7\). 

####  \(2\) New narrative techniques to transform heritage management and presentation 

 In 2013, Perry’s research into the use of digital methods for heritage presentation led to her appointment as Director of Visualisation at Çatalhöyük. With funding from the BIAA, her research has facilitated wholescale change in the interpretation of this UNESCO World Heritage site. Whereas previous presentations focused on the physical remains using traditional display techniques, the new visitor experience takes an audience\-led approach, underpinned with storytelling, and prompting social interaction amongst visitors. The theme of storytelling and promotion of social interaction is carried through in Perry’s team’s design of interpretative materials at the four new Neolithic replica houses for visitors; in their design of 50 new on\-site information panels and 15 new Visitor’s Centre panels; in the design of a bilingual \(Turkish/ English\) guidebook, brochure, map, and children’s handout; in the www.catalhoyuk.com website; and in the implementation of chatbots on site \( **5.4**\). Perry’s work accompanied an increase of 30% in visitor numbers, from 14,718 in 2011 to an average of 20,000 per year from 2013 to the end of the BIAA project in 2016 \( **5.5**\). The Director of the Çatalhöyük Research Project notes that “Sara’s research into the emotive connection between heritage sites and the visitor experience has had a transformative effect on the way in which the site is presented to visitors. She has linked premium presentation skills with a strong ethical commitment to diverse publics and has been able to integrate site interpretation into scholarly debate within the discipline more broadly” \( **5.6**\) **.** Numan Arslan came to Çatalhöyük as an excavator in 2008, leaving the site in 2018. Reflecting on his experience over 10 years he noted how “Sara’s focus on storytelling had an important influence on the presentation of Çatalhöyük.” Discussing visitor responses to the changes he highlighted how the redesign, incorporating a drama\-based narrative advocated by Perry’s research, improved the visitor experience by encouraging visitors to stay longer, to observe the site more carefully, and to ask more questions \( **5.7**\). 

 Transformations to heritage presentation enabled by Perry's research have also extended across Egypt following the MSCD project. In July 2017, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities created a new committee for site management initiated by former field school students \( **5.8**\) and staff, and employing five graduates \( **5.3**\). Announcing the new initiative in 2016, the Ancient Egypt Research Associates’ newsletter explained how the committee aims to “share the lessons learned from the MSCD project with a larger audience. Building on the concepts they were exposed to during the MSCD field schools, this committee will soon begin to assess visitor experience and site presentation at museums and sites throughout Egypt” \( **5.8**\). Perry’s research is now being cascaded throughout the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities by the field school graduates, where it is empowering the next generation of Egyptian archaeologists. An evaluation conducted 18 months after the first field school showed that despite the difficulty of contacting graduates after this length of time, 87% of respondents had directly applied their new knowledge to improving heritage management in Egypt. Trainees were inspired to create more inclusive heritage sites, and 49% of respondents reported that they had instigated specific initiatives as a result of MSCD. These include the creation of new guidebooks for all open museums in Egypt; the preparation of site management plans for Saqqara and Abusir, Tell\-Basta, Tanis, and the Jedefra pyramid; use of social media for community engagement in the Alexandria area; the development of new information panels for Giza, Dendera, the Governorate of Alexandria, Historic Cairo, the Egyptian Museum of Cairo, and Sohag; and the development or redevelopment of visitor facilities and visitor experiences in multiple locations such as Karnak, Giza, the Dakhliya Governorate, Dendera, Historic Cairo, the Shunetel\-Zebibareain Abydos, Sohag, and Beni Suef \( **5.2a**\). Two graduates reported working to list new World Heritage Sites in Egypt \( **5.2a**\). 

  

 The cascading effects of the field schools have contributed not only to enriching Egypt’s visitor interpretation infrastructure, but also to professionalising the country’s delivery of heritage management. An independent evaluation report commissioned by USAID commended the value of the work at Memphis “for training on visitor management challenges” \( **5.1**, p.32\). Perry has used her research into the ‘ethic of care’ to train professionals and local communities in implementing and analysing emotive public interpretation practices themselves – in both the Global South and developed countries – empowering them to foster wider change. 

 Perry’s research has also provided a direct framework for the research and public engagement programmes of two of the leading heritage organisations in the UK: Museum of London Archaeology \(MOLA\) and the JORVIK group. Arising from her involvement in EMOTIVE in 2017 Perry gained sponsorship from MUPI \(the Museum University Partnership Initiative\) to collaborate with JORVIK staff in the ‘Viking Hack’ project, exploring approaches to ‘difficult histories’ and using Perry’s research into affective interpretation at a range of museums and heritage sites, including the US Holocaust Museum and Colonial Williamsburg, with a view to understanding how similar techniques might be applied at their attractions. The JORVIK Group is responsible for five major attractions, including the JORVIK Viking Centre \(1,000,000 visitors per annum, and extensively redesigned following flood damage in 2015\), and the proposed Eboracum development.  The Head of Interpretation and Engagement notes how his collaboration with Perry on the ‘Viking Hack’ led to impacts on “the Group’s interpretation and engagement methods, staff training programmes and safeguarding policies” \( **5.9**\). These can be seen for example in “a new narrative history of the Vikings of Jorvik…\[written\] to situate Jorvik within the tradition of museum\-based storytelling” and in the inclusion in the staff training programme of “a section on ethics, which incorporates the idea of difficult histories and how to help visitors to address them” \( **5.9**\). He concluded that: “Sara’s research into the emotive connection between heritage sites and the visitor experience has changed the way the JORVIK Group thinks about presenting heritage to the public, and how it trains its staff” \( **5.9**\). 

 In her new role as Director of Research and Engagement \(R&E\) for MOLA \(November 2019 to present\), Perry leads a team of 80 specialists across two main offices and multiple sites. The CEO of MOLA writes: “her research into the development, circulation and evaluation of analogue and digital media for engaging diverse audiences with the past – and her extensive experience in running participatory projects around the world – were crucial to her hiring at MOLA” \( **5.10**\). Indeed, prior to her arrival, her 2018 paper \( **3.4**\) had been “circulated to staff as a prompt for discussion about how the typical approach to field archaeology might change to generate greater value and impact for the British public and for archaeologists themselves. At her job interview, Sara presented a vision for the future of MOLA’s R&E team that was directly linked to her 2019 publication” \( **3.1**\), \( **5.10**\). The CEO of MOLA continues: “Since joining MOLA, Sara has begun to apply her research\-led proposals to the organisation. This necessitated a series of major structural changes in order to facilitate implementation of the larger vision.” She notes that Perry’s research into user experience design and co\-design methodologies developed through the EMOTIVE project’s design cards has “been woven directly into everyday practice at MOLA. Her Engagement Project Managers and Engagement Team deploy elements of the cards on the design of new tenders and on the definition of target audiences and outcomes for new projects. Previously no consistent approach to defining audiences or outcomes was used, and hence her team’s ability to rigorously track impacts and trends has until now been very challenging. As well, her approach to social media engagement \(e.g. Perry 2015 \( **3.5**\)\) has led to the development of a specific digital engagement work package for our field teams, which will be pilot tested in the spring on a live excavation and, if successful, woven into future offers for clients” \( **5.10**\).

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Accurate teaching of contemporary spoken English in schools improves societal understanding of dialects and challenges language\-based discrimination. A\-Level teachers report an urgent need for expert guidance and up\-to\-date content for teaching contemporary English Language. Since 2013, world\-leading Queen Mary University of London research on British and World Englishes has been converted into classroom content for all GCE A\-Level, GCSE, and EAL/TESOL teachers. This has been delivered via the web\-based *Teach Real English\!* teaching materials. AQA Board examiners and teachers around the UK have incorporated the new content into the national AQA/GCE English Language curriculum, teacher training, and in\-class practice across the UK and internationally. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Queen Mary sociolinguists, Professors Sharma, Cheshire, and Levon, have played a leading role in the study of ongoing change in spoken English. This work has fundamentally expanded our knowledge of London English, World Englishes, and attitudes to spoken English. It has enabled teachers to satisfy core themes required by the AQA and other subject boards on cultural diversity, structural variation, and historical change in their teaching of contemporary spoken English. 

 <ins>London English</ins>: Cheshire, Sharma, and Levon have led the study of contemporary English across all social classes in London. Cheshire’s ESRC\-funded team conducted the first ever large\-scale sociolinguistic study of London. They documented the birth of a new dialect, Multicultural London English \(MLE\), showing that it arose in young multi\-ethnic peer groups in working\-class East London, displacing Cockney and spreading to traditional white working\-class groups \[3.1\]. MLE stands as one of the foremost recent discoveries in dialectology and the phrase has entered public discourse. Sharma’s ESRC\-funded team showed that a lower\-middle\-class, more mono\-ethnic community just west of the birthplace of MLE developed an entirely different accent, British Asian English. To understand why, she pioneered new methods for studying accent repertoire, social network, speech style, and inter\-generational language change \[3.2\]. Levon’s research on middle/upper\-class speech showed that the whole system of vowels is lowering yet maintaining class distinctions, and updated public beliefs by challenging the stereotype that young middle\-class women use more ‘uptalk’ \(rising intonation\) than men \[3.3\]. His work has pioneered an intersectional approach in sociolinguistics \[3.4\]. 

 <ins>World</ins> <ins>Englishes</ins>: Sharma’s 20\-year body of research on new English dialects worldwide compares Indian, Singaporean, African\-American, Creole, and second\-language English varieties \[3.5\]. As with her London research, this work has comprehensively documented the structure of World Englishes but also, crucially, why they come about—the basis of considerable public misinformation and prejudice. 

 <ins>Attitudes to English</ins>: To investigate the social impact of negative attitudes to new and old accents, Levon and Sharma’s ESRC\-funded team conducted the first ever nationwide study of British attitudes to class, regional, and ethnic voices and their impact on professional recruiting \[3.6\]. Using novel experimental methods, they found that a long\-standing hierarchy of accent prestige affects judgements of professional competence. The project is developing anti\-bias training with HR teams and law firms \(www.accentbiasbritain.org\). 

 Peer esteem for this research is reflected in Cheshire, Sharma, and Levon holding recent editorships at *Language in Society* and *Journal of Sociolinguistics*, the top two sociolinguistics journals. The research has attracted major national and international coverage, e.g.  Sharma: *The Telegraph*, BBC Radio 4, BBC World Service, Levon: *The Independent*, *Financial Times*, Cheshire: *Economist*, CNN. The team are exceptionally well placed to lead this comprehensive update of spoken English Language in the national curriculum. Sharma led the creation of this suite of classroom materials. In addition to core content based on the research of three core scholars, Sharma integrated impact into the Queen Mary department’s research by encouraging other members of staff to add research\-based content relating to attitudes in the media, fake news, attitudes to changing grammar, and digital media.

 Research on British and World Englishes has resulted in three key areas of impact: curriculum content reform, teacher training, and student understanding. 

 Sharma and Cheshire first consulted 45 teachers \(10/2017, KS3/GCSE/A\-Level/ESOL\). Cheshire had previously created materials on one theme \(Multicultural London English, REF2014 ICS\); teachers requested expanded content in this accessible format. They cited an urgent need to build technical expertise, meet exam board requirements to be research\-led, and equip students with updated knowledge and skills. To maximise relevance to subject specifications, Sharma consulted a UK\-wide advisory panel \(18 teachers, senior examiners, lead moderator of AQA English Language\) and identified six core curriculum domains. 

 Sharma then created Teach Real English\! \( [www.teachrealenglish.org](http://www.teachrealenglish.org/)\) as an interactive resource for teachers to update their A\-level English Language content, all based on Queen Mary’s sociolinguistics research: \(i\) 30 Teaching Units with audio recordings, transcripts, state\-of\-the\-art analysis based on underpinning research, and classroom guidance: \(ii\) Linguistics Research Digest: 217 easy\-to\-read summaries of relevant recent academic articles; \(iii\) 17 guided Language Investigation projects for students; and \(iv\) technical Glossary. A\-Level English Language teachers and students are primary beneficiaries. GCSE/EFL/EAL teachers and the general public are secondary beneficiaries. 

#  Shaping GCE A\-Level English Language curricula and teacher training 

 The national AQA English Language lead moderator and trainers have used this research to update national curricula and AQA\-led teacher training courses \[5.4\]. They describe the research as ‘instrumental in helping to update the A\-Level English Language curriculum’ \[5.4\], ‘crucial in moving the A\-Level English Language curriculum forward’ and supporting ‘fundamental changes in the types of social concepts, theories, and language use teachers and students focus on in class’ \[5.4\]. 

 The research team provided training via 18 teacher workshops and talks \[5.1, UK\-wide attendance by >100 schools\], 5 articles in professional publications \[5.2\], and sustained social media contact with hundreds of GCE/GCSE teachers \[5.7\]. This has led to very high, sustained website traffic: 779,442 visitors \(1/8/2013\-30/8/2020\), avg. 10,689/month \[5.3\]. The most frequently accessed Teaching Units cover Queen Mary research on ethnic minority speech, social class, and regularity of language change, equipping teachers and students with technical understanding and combating misrepresentations of dialect superiority. 

 Feedback provided by 52 teachers \[5.5\] confirms changes in both understanding \(‘more up\-to\-date concepts and ideas \(AO2 in exam board parlance\)’\) and practice \(‘specific examples to analyse in the form of transcripts \(AO1 skills\)’\). Examiners and teachers actively promote the content via AQA textbooks \[5.6\], professional magazines \[5.2\], and Social Media \[5.7\], e.g. ‘what a great resource \[…\] to add to my teaching library’ and ‘looking forward to teaching this \[resource\]’. 

  

#  Influencing GCE A\-level English Language student understanding 

 Official AQA reports embed this research in curriculum and report student uptake \[5.8\]. The lead moderator of AQA English Language states: 

 ‘\[e\]xaminers have reported seeing the influence of these interventions in the work produced by students in recent exam responses… the national AQA report for 7702/2 specifically mentions Teach Real English\! content that has appeared in students’ answers \(‘More successful students… discussed the repertoire analysis by Devyani Sharma’\) It is rare to see resources like this have such a rapid impact on student work’ \[5.4\]. 

 Surveyed students report uptake, e.g. ‘extremely useful, as it gave me a range of data and information for me to use in exam questions’ \[5.5\]. Teachers report benefits for students in understanding \(‘it increases their chances of getting good grades as they are exploring new and different ideas… begins to prepare them for university’\) and awareness \(‘vital for getting them to see that people's everyday speech was a valid subject for analysis and not ‘wrong’ or ‘ungrammatical.’ \[5.5\]\). Students acquire content via in\-class teaching, textbooks \[5.6\], school websites \[5.9\], and talks at student/school events \[5.1\]. Teachers routinely direct students to the materials \(‘Year 13 mock revision – accent and dialect and language and occupation combined. SO useful\!\!’ \[5.7\]\) and engage students in media coverage of the research \[5.7 p.4,9\]. 

#  Impacting on EFL/ESL/EAL teaching content and delivery 

 The National Association for English as an Auxiliary Language \(NALDIC formerly known as\) requested an article on the resources for their EAL journal \[5.2\], in order to address ‘addresses areas that have typically been underrepresented, certainly in NALDIC’s output’ \[5.4\]. EAL teachers attending workshops echoed this need, reflecting on their use of the materials: 

 ‘particularly for my C1/C2 students the actual focus on different accents and differing styles \(hedging and discourse markers\) helps them achieve native or near\-native ability’ \[5.5\]. 

 The website sees high traffic \[5.3\] from international EAL/ELT organisations/teachers, e.g. ‘fantastic Spoken London English resources with recordings, transcripts, and discussion points. Great for teaching pron\! by researchers’ \(Poland\) \[5.7\].

Emphasis on supporting multilingual communities in safeguarding and sharing their linguistic heritage has helped to strength local communities and aid the integration of refugee and other vulnerable minority groups. Impact in this topic has focused on developing language teaching tools which can be used in a range of contexts, whether it be aiding in second language teaching for students with SpLDs or creating international teaching partnerships to enable language mentoring. Case studies in this strand often participate in the preservation and recovery of native languages, particularly Gaelic. Welsh-language learning tools, often capitalising on the opportunity for crowdsourcing knowledge online, have made impressive strides in boosting public interest in Welsh learning.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Huertas Barros and Vine’s research into translation and interpreting \(T&I\) training has produced findings aimed at improving pedagogy and assessment that have been put into practice in the UK and beyond by a range of translation stakeholders. Impacts include: 

-  direct changes to the assessment practice of commercial translation companies; 

-  enhancing industry understanding of the nature of the trained workforce \(sharing detailed insights into academic provision and practice\); 

-  enhancing translation assessment practice across UK higher education institutions \(HEI\) via the first survey of such provision in this sector; 

-  extending this impact to translator training in Spain.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 With the spread of competence\-based approaches to translator training, a need has arisen for empirical studies of the extent to which this pedagogical approach is being incorporated in teaching, learning, and assessment on translation courses in HEI. Identifying assessment practice as a valuable lens through which to view current understandings of translation pedagogy, Huertas Barros and Vine undertook a case study of tutors’ \(n=16\) perceptions and use of summative assessment on the MA translation modules at the University of Westminster \[1\]. In doing so they redressed the lack of empirical studies on assessment practices and, more broadly, the lack of research relating assessment practices in translator education to wider HE debates on assessment. The survey results highlighted the need for assessment instruments and marking criteria to more explicitly reflect the skills demands of the commercial translation market \(the majority of tutors surveyed worked in both HEI and industry\); for such assessment criteria to be better clarified; and for assessments to encompass not only the end product but the translation process also. 

 Seeking to test the practical application of their findings, the results of Huertas Barros and Vine’s study were used as a basis for consultation and discussion with the MA teaching staff at Westminster, and this foundational research resulted in the remodelling of assessment practices in the core translation modules via the development of new criteria and a revamped feedback sheet, as well as changes in the weighting of assessments. In light of the changes implemented, Huertas Barros and Vine undertook a study of the broader learning community to assess the efficacy of these changes, surveying both the MA tutors \(n=16\) and the cohort of students \(n=53\) on their perceptions of the marking criteria and assessment patterns \[2\]. Through this second empirical study, Huertas Barros and Vine identified the importance of effectively integrating assessment literacy into course design, finding that fuller understanding of the criteria and processes involved in assessing translation will both raise assessment standards and better equip learners with the ability to objectively assess the quality of translation in their own work and that of others. By demonstrating how the construction of assessment standards can be enhanced through direct engagement with learning communities \(both tutors and students\), the methodology and findings of this research into changes at their own institution constituted an informed proposal for best practice in translation training across the broader sector, which Huertas Barros and Vine would take forward through the activities described in Section 4. 

 Outputs \[1\] and \[2\] were central to the University of Westminster’s successful application for European Masters in Translation \( [EMT](https://ec.europa.eu/info/resources-partners/european-masters-translation-emt_en)\) status in June 2019, with Westminster being one of only 5 institutions to have more than one MA course awarded EMT status. The assessment instruments, tasks, and criteria of the core translation modules of both of the awarded MA courses were redesigned on the basis of the findings of these outputs, demonstrating the value of this research to actionable assessment practice. 

 In carrying out background research for their survey of the assessment practices at Westminster, the researchers found that, although there had been a rapid increase in programmes offering translation and interpreting training, there was no research into how this training was being offered. The next phase of their research project was thus to investigate assessment practices across the UK HEI sector. Huertas Barros and Vine undertook, for the first time, a review of all 27 MA Translation courses offered by UK universities and investigated the extent to which competence\-based approaches and changes in the translation market are actually informing assessment practice on the core translation modules of such courses \[3\]. In regard to competence\-based approaches, the research revealed a diverse range of practices encompassing learning outcomes, assessment instruments and tasks, and assessment criteria. It also revealed unifying trends in the response from UK universities to market changes and new pedagogical approaches to translation. The data collected from the survey was analysed using the concept of ‘fit for purpose’ and the six tenets of assessment set out by the Higher Education Academy \(HEA\) in its paper ‘A Marked Improvement: Transforming Assessment’ \( [2012](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/A_Marked_Improvement.pdf)\), as reaffirmed in ‘The case for transforming assessment in higher education’ \( [2016](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/downloads/assessment_viewpoint_aug16.pdf)\). Huertas Barros and Vine’s analysis indicates that the use of translation competence as a pedagogical model increases the probability that assessment practices are fit for purpose, and that there is a need to increase awareness of all the HEA tenets of assessment and, particularly, assessment literacy \(outputs \[2\], \[3\], \[4\]\). 

 One of the aims of the above research was to provide an overview of practices and changes in practices that could inform individual universities in their designing of assessment and courses. This has been built upon by Huertas Barros and Vine in their most recent research, which recommends ways to embed the tenets of assessment, especially assessment literacy, into module design and delivery. By introducing a case study on module design with a collaborative transcreation \(the translation of advertising material for use in a different cultural and/or linguistic environment\) project at its core, the researchers were able to identify a set of concepts that can be applied to the curricular needs of translation trainers in order to future proof students in the changing employment market \[4\].

#  4.1 Changes to practice in the translation industry 

 Huertas Barros and Vine adapted the components of best practice identified in their research into adoptable techniques for embedding into an industry context. The researchers then organised and led a joint academia and industry workshop \(June 2017\) for 25 stakeholders which **provided practical methods for enhancing translator competence and quality assessment**, emphasising the importance of the process of translation to the success of the product. 

 Follow up testimony collected two years after the workshop has recorded Huertas Barros and Vine’s direct impact on these industry stakeholders’ practices. These changes – and their related benefits – are outlined in the table below. 

| **Stakeholder**:  [Translator Training](https://www.translator-training.com/about/about-us), an online training provider which has helped more than 1000 students take a professional qualification in translation and employs 45 tutors from industry and education. The following testimony is from the Course Director at Translator Training \[a1\]. |
| --- | --- |
| **Changes due to the workshop** | **Benefit of these changes** |
|-  “reviewed our provision of feedback and attendant documentation. After consultation with key staff I decided to make specific changes in line with the ideas discussed at the workshop, to the wording of our feedback sheet, which is provided by translation tutors to students on the distance learning course”; -  the feedback sheet “included further explanation and contextualisation” e.g. Performance Aspects were given definitions, Error Categories were “updated to facilitate a reflective post\-analysis on the part of the student”. |-  “help\[s\] both teachers and students in analysing areas needing more attention”; -  “the diagrammatic/visual layout enables both teachers and students to ‘see’ and chart progress. This can then provide an important starting point for discussion in telephone tutorials or Skype sessions”. |
| **Stakeholder:**  [Hogarth Worldwide](https://www.hogarthww.com/), a leading marketing consultancy firm with over 4,000 employees across 28 cities worldwide that provides language services to clients, including transcreation. The following testimony is from an Account Director at Hogarth Worldwide \[a2\]. |
| **Changes due to the workshop** | **Benefit of these changes** |
|-  “created a specific client relevant translation test for new freelance translators. These tests are assessed using our ‘Translator Performance Review Tool’ by our existing specialised and trusted translators”; -  “introduced the Translator Training Pack which is now sent to all new translators”, consisting of client relevant facets: brand background and company profile; glossary in local language; style guide for local language; reference materials; -  “introduced a new approach when it comes to provid\[ing\] feedback to our translators. After each project, we share client feedback with the talents when relevant”; -  “introduced a periodic assessment in case of an internal complaint or in case of an external complaint \(from other talent or client\)”. |-  “before joining our database, all our translators are fully vetted to test their writing skills and subject matter expertise. Only the best are selected”; -  “make\[s\] sure there is consistency across the account and avoid numerous emails to Project managers asking for guidelines on the above subjects”; -  “the translators get familiar with the style and terminology requested by the client \[…\] avoiding future changes or complaints from the client”; -  “keep\[s\] our database always updated with the best talents by stopping any collaboration with those talents that do not meet our quality requirements”. |
| **Stakeholder**:  [Deluxe Media](https://www.bydeluxe.com/en/), a world leading video creation company, encompassing the production of subtitle files for digital cinema releases. The following testimony is from the Team Lead at Deluxe Media \[a3\]. |
| **Changes due to the workshop** | **Benefit of these changes** |
|-  “gave rise to thinking about how to achieve more quality in the quality control team \[…\] at the time, I had little direct experience with translator or translation quality evaluation”; -  “putting in place regular group feedback sessions on client rejections and proactive work quality monitoring”. |-  “the awareness of quality procedures and the use of software has been raised and the number of rejections for obvious errors has decreased” partly because of strategies stimulated by the workshop. |

 The impact of the researchers’ work – through output \[3\] and the surveys described below – has also extended to further language service providers within industry via the Association of Translation Companies \( [ATC](https://atc.org.uk/)\); the language sector’s leading professional body in the UK. The researchers were commissioned to produce an in\-depth industry briefing informed by the data collected in their surveys to **enable language service providers to better understand the nature of the trained workforce**. The ATC’s CEO states: “The briefing was welcomed by the ATC and the language service companies it represents, as it provided up\-to\-date insights into the academic provision undertaken by current and future staff members and freelancers employed or commissioned by the ATC. \[…\] These insights help direct further on\-the\-job training needs, and form a solid basis for understanding new candidates’ academic backgrounds” \[a4\]. The detailed industry briefing authored by Huertas Barros and Vine \[a5\] was published on the ATC website on Dec 1 2020 and was promoted in the ATC Newsletter December 2020 \[a6\], reaching “some 3,500 language services industry recipients” \[a4\]. 

#  4.2 Impact on Translator Training within UK Higher Education 

 The President of the Association of Programmes in Translation and Interpreting Studies in the UK and Ireland \( [APTIS](https://www.aptis-translation-interpreting.org/)\) explains that Huertas Barros and Vine’s 2015 UK\-wide survey on assessment practices on MA T&I programmes, which underpinned output \[3\] above, “was an important undertaking that **made many T&I colleagues across the UK realise the importance of looking at the specifics of translator training provision in the UK**. Their research into T&I provision and the different approaches to translator training in the UK also **acted as a platform through which colleagues have been able to share and inform good practice**” \[b1\]. 

 In this way, Huertas Barros and Vine’s survey stimulated improvements in T&I across the UK, and these impacts were **consolidated by** **the formation of APTIS in response to the survey** having highlighted the need for a peer\-support network of T&I researchers: “This first survey coincided with and contributed to the desire for T&I programmes in the UK to collaborate more closely in order to be in position to face the many challenges facing translator training. To this end, my colleague Dr Castro \(Warwick University\) and I set about creating an association for T&I programmes in the UK in 2016” \[b1\]. This association of 24 HEIs works “to improve the quality of learning and teaching as well as research on translation and interpreting programmes at Higher Education institutions” through knowledge exchange amongst members via newsletters, webinars, a forum, and an annual conference \[b2\]. 

 To this end, the President states APTIS invited Huertas Barros and Vine “to present their cutting\-edge research on translation assessment in a dedicated Workshop at our first annual conference \(APTIS 2018, Aston University\)”, delivered to representatives of 15 HEI institutions \[b1\]. The President adds: “Based on their research, this workshop was extremely successful in **challenging participants’ views on assessment on T&I programmes** and will no doubt have had an impact on the way colleagues think about the assessment strategy on their own translator training programmes” \[b1\]. 

 At the third annual Conference in Nov 2019, APTIS officially endorsed Huertas Barros and Vine’s proposed second iteration of the survey of UK university programmes, this time encompassing 30 institutions \[b3\]. As 5 years had passed since the first survey, the April 2020 follow\-up survey provided richer data reflecting the last 10 years of T&I training and captured changes in HEI and in the related industry \(employers of the trained students\), thus providing an opportunity for educators across the UK to share their best practice and to therefore identify and adopt improvements as found in the practice of others. As the President of APTIS confirms, the researchers’ “initial survey was so **useful to APTIS in gathering and disseminating information about existing T&I courses \(and, therefore, informing best practice\)** that we decided to officially support the second iteration of the survey” \[b1\]. 

#  4.3 Impact on Translator Training in Spain 

 The above impacts created through Huertas Barros and Vine’s surveys and related outputs have also extended into Spain via the “Evaluation in the Acquisition of Translation Competence” \( [EACT](https://pagines.uab.cat/eact/en)\) project, which aims to establish evaluation procedures for different levels of acquisition of translation competence and is led by Procés d'Adquisició de la Competència Traductora i Avaluació \( [PACTE](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/pacte/en)\); a world\-leading research group in translation training comprising academics from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. 

 According to the EACT Principal Researcher, the project’s first phase “is a replication of Huertas Barros’ and Vine’s \(2016, 2018, 2019\) objective but in the context of translation training in Spain” \[c1\]. As such, Huertas Barros was engaged as an external consultant with “a key role in the design” of the EACT survey of BA Translation programmes in Spain, for which “Huertas Barros and Vine’s surveys \[…\] served as a basis” \[c1\]. 

 Huertas Barros provided advice “in terms of its structure, sections and content as well as the methodological design, including the survey items and response scales, and a first internal validation test of the survey” \[c1\]. Her engagement resulted in the reorganisation of questions, their rewording to avoid ambiguity, the narrowing of their scope, and the replication of 12 questions that had been included in Huertas Barros and Vine’s own surveys \[c1\]. 

 The impact of this EACT survey, finalised in July 2020, replicates that of the one undertaken in the UK **.** The survey provides insight into the current assessment practices in translation training programmes in Spain and **enables identification of the main issues and gaps that need to be addressed to improve translation training and students’ learning experience**, specifically in relation to assessment practices. As such, the survey results “benefit students and tutors given their direct application to translation training material and curriculum design” and also benefits “translators and translation companies by informing guidelines for quality control in translation practice” \[c1\]. 

 The impact of this intervention on the work of PACTE is that the survey outcomes are **vital to their creation of “standardised evaluation procedures” that will validate the accuracy and appropriateness of pioneering competence descriptors** \[c1\]. Previously established in their “Establishing Competence Levels in the Acquisition of Translation Competence” \( [NACT](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/pacte/en/collaboratinginstitutions)\) project, upon which EACT builds, these competence descriptors provided, for the first time, translation competence levels that function as equivalents to the widely used A\-C Common European Framework of Reference for Languages \(CEFR\), ensuring the quality of translation by enabling consistency between universities and service providers. 

 Huertas Barros and Vine were part of the  [panel](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/pacte/en/evaluators) of external expert advisors for the 2015\-2018 NACT project, with the former providing consultancy on the initial proposed framework of competence levels \[c2\]. Both then took part in the appraisal of the revised competence framework by evaluating the appropriateness of each category and proposed level, as well as the text genres associated with each category and their level of progression. The researchers also evaluated and advised on the main abilities and requirements of the different levels \[c3\]. 

 Huertas Barros and Vine thus significantly contributed to both NACT and EACT, the success of which has enabled PACTE to access a €253,280 EU grant for a project that will provide final validation for these descriptors and result in such standardisation in translation training: “ [EFFORT](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/projects/eplus-project-details/): Towards a European Framework of Reference for Translation”.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Television archives are vital cultural collections, but their significance is often underappreciated. Moseley and Wheatley have used television archives to engage communities, benefit cultural organisations, identify new materials for collections, and raise the profile of archives within media organisations and for the public. An exhibition at The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, and national tour, of *The Story of Children’s Television* \(2014\-17\), and an exhibition and series of screenings, *Ghost Town: Civic Television and the Haunting of Coventry* \(2018\-\), have attracted over 144,000 combined visitors. These events have increased revenues, encouraged national and regional engagement with cultural organisations in Coventry, and provided evidence for the sustained resourcing of television archives and children’s programming. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Moseley and Wheatley, founders of Warwick’s Centre for Television Histories, have researched and published on children’s television as a significant aspect of national cultural production and heritage \(3.2; 3.4\). Their historical work on television more broadly has redefined the shape of the intellectual field \(3.1; 3.3\) and drawn attention to previously undervalued forms, including programming for women and young audiences. Working with the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Moseley and Wheatley pitched and then collaborated on the exhibition *The Story of Children’s Television, 1946 to Today* \(3.4; 3.5\), illustrating the importance of children’s television cultures for a public audience. The team conducted field research to explore visitors’ responses to the exhibition and their encounters with the material histories of children’s television \(3.4\). Through connections made during this project, the team went on to develop the *Ghost Town* project in collaboration with local, regional and national organisations, looking at how Coventry’s history could be ‘activated’ for its citizens via research that brought key programmes made in and about the city out of the television archive. The research findings emerging from this project have shown how a better public understanding of the cultural value of the television archive can be underpinned by situating its holdings within a civic context \(3.6\). 

 Research findings from these projects have shown: 

 1. The urgent necessity for engagement with our television history as an important aspect of a shared civic, regional, national and international cultural heritage \(3.1; 3.2; 3.4; 3.5; 3.6\). 

 2. Exhibitions of historic television offer significant opportunity for intergenerational discussion and interaction, and expose the powerful relationship between television as a shared cultural form, and personal and social formations of memory \(3.1; 3.4; 3.5; 3.6\). 

 3. The significant role television can play in the space of the museum and the exhibition, and the innovative ways in which the history of television can be told in these spaces \(3.3; 3.4; 3.5; 3.6\). 

 4. Academic research’s role in developing/exploiting the television archive and the opportunities that engaging with television brings for cultural organisations, including extending their reach to new audiences and increasing income \(3.1; 3.5; 3.6\). 

 5. That television history needs to be simultaneously considered as an industry, a significant cultural form with multiple audiences, and a set of creative/artistic works \(3.1; 3.2; 3.3; 3.5; 3.6\). 

 In addition, the research underpinning *The Story of Children's Television* 2015 exhibition, has demonstrated the following findings: 

 6. The aesthetic and cultural richness of British children's television past and present; this is a significant shift away from dominant paradigms in work on children's television, which has focused solely on media industrial history, ecology and effects \(3.2; 3.4; 3.5\). 

 7. That the hand\-made aesthetics and material cultures of British children’s television are central to its meaning, significance and place in intergenerational, personal and cultural memories \(3.2; 3.4; 3.5\). 

 8. That the history of children’s television, and the encounter with that history in the museum, offer a direct challenge to Andreas Huyssen’s suggestion that ‘television denies the material quality of the object’ \(3.4; 3.5\). 

 Research by Wheatley and Moseley \(2017 – present\) on the *Ghost Town* project has also demonstrated that: 

 9. Television archives uniquely gather the traces of a city's cultural, social, and political life and bringing these traces out of the archive presents a way for researchers and the public to examine a city's past, present and future. This presents a radical shift away from conceptions of the archive as being only for specialist users \(3.6\). 

 10. Archive television has an important role to play in the cultural offer of cities, and in place making activities that are central to City of Culture years \(3.6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Working collaboratively with a number of national, regional and civic organisations, Moseley and Wheatley’s research has brought historical television programming of international, national and local significance to Coventry \(5.1; 5.2\). Using their research into television archives, Moseley and Wheatley curated two sets of exhibitions in Coventry: 

 1\) *The Story of Children’s Television from 1946 to Now* \(2015\) was developed with the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, one of Coventry’s key cultural organisations. It featured over 200 objects from popular children’s television shows \(such as original puppets from *Muffin the Mule*, *Play School* and *Rosie and Jim*\) and explored how children’s television forms a significant part of collective and personal cultural heritages. Following its success, the exhibition toured nationally until January 2017. 

 2\) *Ghost Town* \(2018\-\) is an ongoing programme of screenings and exhibitions that bring programmes made in and about Coventry out of the archive, from Philip Donnellan’s 1960 documentary *Coventry Kids* to compilations of arts, news and schools programming. The project identifies and commissions restoration and digitisation work on significant programmes with the aim of increasing civic engagement with the television archive, and highlighting the cultural significance of this important national asset. 

 These exhibitions came at a crucial time for the city’s cultural development as it builds towards its year as UK City of Culture in 2021. The exhibitions have benefitted Coventry’s cultural organisations, increased community engagement and raised the profile of television archives on a national level, in the following ways: 

###  Raising the profile and increasing the revenue of Coventry’s cultural organisation via the television archive 

 *The Story of Children’s Television* \(SCT\) brought approximately 83,000 visitors to the Herbert Museum and Art Gallery, ‘by far the most successful exhibition in the Herbert’s 50 year history’ \(Head of Collections at the Herbert, 5.6\). There was a steep increase in people travelling considerable distances to attend the exhibition, raising the national profile of the museum considerably and providing a strong platform for the future City of Culture year \(5.4, p.15\). Significantly, the largest and most increased demographic were people from the local area, the museum’s key audience. During the SCT exhibition, snapshot analysis showed 44% of visitors had never been to the Herbert before and that 73% of first time visitors were from the West Midlands \(5.4, p. 62\-66\). During the exhibition period, GBP10,000 was donated, an increase of nearly 500% on the same period the year before, and the shop experienced an average retail increase of 65% \(5.6\). Press coverage of the exhibition, described by the Herbert’s Head of Collections as ‘unprecedented national media interest’ \(5.6\), included articles in *Daily Mail* \(print readership: 3,354,000, circulation: 1,657,867\), *The Telegraph* \(print readership: 1,183,000, circulation: 486,262\) and BBC News’ website, as well as featuring on broadcast media such as BBC Radio 4, BBC One Breakfast, Channel 5 News and ITV News at 10 \(5.8\). 

 Following the phenomenal success of the exhibition at the Herbert and interest from regional counterparts, the museum organised a nationwide tour for SCT. This was the first media history exhibition and tour the museum had curated and the first ever touring exhibition about children's television in the UK. Tour visitors totalled 61,587, and included new audiences nationwide: in Derby, for example, the year of the tour saw an increase of 30% in schools’ visitors \(and an increase of 10% in donation revenue\) \(5.5\). 

 Following on from SCT, *Ghost Town’s* \(GT\) engagement with television history has also brought new audiences into key cultural sites in Coventry such as the Shopfront Theatre \(5.10\) and Coventry Cathedral \(5.3; 5.10\). According to the Dean of Coventry Cathedral, GT ‘has brought in new audiences who were interested in finding out about the Cathedral and the city’s heritage in an accessible way. As a result of the success of the screenings, we have regularly included archive television screenings as part of our programme of events… The screenings have also benefitted staff and volunteers, who now have a deeper understanding of the city and the Cathedral’s history’ \(5.3\). Feedback gathered from screenings at the Cathedral showed that all respondents who answered the question would come to another event at the venue; many had never visited before, despite the Cathedral’s cultural and geographical prominence in Coventry \(5.10\). 

###  Engaging communities through Television Archives 

 Moseley and Wheatley’s work has engaged communities with television archives, boosting civic pride and enabling cross\-generational conversation at these events. The Director of the Media Archive of Central England \(MACE\) stated that GT created an ‘extremely valuable opportunity \[for\] local communities to engage directly and in\-depth with the archive’s collection. As the feedback gathered from your project activities attest, such engagement can result in personal benefit to those who participate \(improved sense of wellbeing, community connectedness, sense of pride about ones heritage and environs, learning opportunities\)…This deep and direct connection to communities in and around Coventry that your project has enabled would otherwise simply not be achievable’ \(5.1\). 

 Diverse local communities attended events, from schools and families to BAME women’s and refugee groups, local history organisations and individuals investigating their family histories. The CEO of FWT, a women’s charity in Coventry which was invited to a special screening event at the week\-long exhibition *Remembering Coventry*, stated that GT ‘brought the history of the city to a diverse group of women, enabling them to feel more connected to Coventry and to reflect on it as a place to live today’ \(5.9\). Interaction with these exhibitions of archive television prompted ‘explosions’ of memory in attendees and the unlocking and sharing of personal, familial and civic histories between generations and constituencies: one visitor to a GT event commented ‘We were more multi\-national than I ever knew… Younger people should see this archive to see the struggles this city has been through’ \(5.10\). Visitors reported increased feelings of belonging and civic pride: ‘Reinforced, really, my pride in this city of reconciliation, diversity, inspiration and radical vision’; ‘It’s made me feel pride in the city and a connectedness which wasn’t there before. I have to admit I have struggled in the past to feel love or passion for Coventry – this has inspired it\!’ \(5.10\). 

 Similarly, SCT used children’s television programmes to facilitate cross\-generational conversations. Feedback from the exhibition demonstrated that people of all ages attended the exhibition, and comments showed how seeing childhood memories created emotional connections: ‘Wonderful to share my childhood memories with my own children’; ‘So wonderful. Aged 2 to 40 we have all found our favourites and had a lovely afternoon. Brings back great memories’; ‘Loved it\! Brought back memories of things I watched when I was a child, things my children watched and now things my Grandchildren are watching *’* \(5.4, p.58\). 

###  Valuing Television Archives 

 Through engaging with SCT and GT, organisations have re\-evaluated the assets in their collections, making accessible, digitising and restoring key television history holdings. 

 Due to SCT, the BBC and others have exhibited previously inaccessible materials and programmes to the public \(5.2\). The Controller of CBeebies at the time of SCT’s launch, stated that ‘for the BBC and the Children’s department in particular, this exhibition enabled many of us to reflect upon the rich heritage of British Children’s content’. She remarked that ‘the exhibition ran during a period of instability in the Children’s sector and it was heartening to learn that over 80,000 children and adults visited the Herbert Museum... It certainly helped to raise the profile of Children’s content and commitment to our youngest viewers became a key factor during the BBC Charter renewal process’ \(5.2\). 

 MACE has used Moseley and Wheatley’s research into its holdings to ‘better identify and add to the knowledge about materials relating to the city of Coventry. \[GT\] has resulted in digital preservation work on some 80 at\-risk individual works held on obsolete film and videotape formats. In turn, this has widened the accessibility of those materials, enabling users to more easily locate materials through enhanced finding aids and providing the archive with the necessary resource and capacity to share the newly\-digitised content freely online’ \(5.1\). 

 For Coventry Cathedral, research into their uncatalogued audio\-visual archive led to the discovery \(and subsequent restoration\) of one of the most significant documentaries in UK television history, *An Act of Faith* \(1962\), the BBC’s first colour documentary, made about the building of the new cathedral. Whilst historically significant for the Cathedral’s sense of its own history, and for the city, it is also nationally and internationally significant in broadcast history terms \(5.3\).  Furthermore, archival footage identified by Wheatley through GT has formed the basis of a new documentary about Coventry Cathedral *Phoenix at Coventry*, due to air on BBC Four in Spring 2021. Producer John Wyver said that GT has brought ‘new and exciting material from a huge range of collections … provid\[ing\] a fresh perspective on the history of \[Coventry Cathedral\] and the role that it has played in the cultural development of Coventry and the nation since the Second World War’ \(5.7\). 

 GT has opened up the richness of the Cathedral’s A/V archive and future possibilities for its creative use. According to the Dean of the Cathedral, ‘…we now have a deeper understanding of the significance of the Cathedral’s moving image archive. Helen Wheatley’s work…has provided access to the resources needed to restore and digitise these key holdings. We are now in a position to make the best of this collection and to ensure that it is properly preserved for future generations.’ The Cathedral has received an archive scoping grant as a result the collaboration which is helping them to identify significant assets in their holdings, and has also invested in new sound equipment to improve its audio\-visual events \(5.3\). 

 The exhibitions ignited an appetite among visitors for access to the television archive, as a result of an increased awareness and understanding of the value of television history as cultural heritage. Over two thirds of the research participants on the GT project discussed their increased knowledge, or reaffirmation, of the importance of the television archive \(5.10\). Approximately a quarter of event visitors told researchers that they hadn’t previously known about the existence of television archives, but that they now realised its value, and at all research events people talked about wanting better/more open/continual access to the archives the research team had drawn on in curating these exhibitions. This was a significant finding for the projects’ partners who wished to develop strategic engagements with the public and use this research to build an argument for funding \(5.1; 5.2\). 

 As a result of Moseley and Wheatley’s research and collaborations, television archives have become more accessible to the public, have benefitted cultural organisations in Coventry and beyond and have engaged communities with the significance of the archive.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prof Chambers’ research in feminist philosophy has had significant impact on UK national policy, law, medical practice, and public understanding. Chambers contributed ethical analysis to a major Nuffield Council report on Cosmetic Procedures, which has significantly influenced the Council’s lobbying on cosmetic procedure regulation and their engagement with UK government ministers, parliament, and stakeholders. Chambers has also given talks to cosmetic surgeons, leading to many changing their practice to lengthen consultations and explore alternatives to surgery with their patients. This policy and practice impact has been complemented by public engagement on this topic and on the issues raised in her book *Against Marriage*. One outcome of the latter was Chambers’ significant influence on a case made to the Supreme Court in 2018 that successfully legalised different\-sex civil partnerships. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The impact featured in this case study has been achieved thanks to applications of Chambers’ feminist political philosophy, particularly her work on the problematic status of choice in liberalism. Chambers’ research carried out at the University of Cambridge since 2006 on the difficulties of choice addressed a problem for theories of liberalism that afford inviolability to individual autonomy. Autonomous individuals often choose to do things that harm themselves or undermine their own equality. In particular, women often choose to participate in practices of sexual inequality—cosmetic surgery, gendered patterns of work and childcare, makeup, restrictive clothing, or the sexual subordination required by membership in certain religious groups. 

 In her 2008 book *Sex, Culture, and Justice: the Limits of Choice* \[R1\] Chambers argued that a theory of justice cannot ignore the influence of culture and the role it plays in shaping choices. On Chambers’ analysis, culture shapes choices in at least two ways: by influencing a person’s preferences; and by restricting the options that are available. Given that cultures shape choices, Chambers argues that it is problematic to use those choices as the measure of the justice of the culture. Drawing upon feminist critiques of gender inequality and poststructuralist theories of social construction, the book argues that we should accept some of the multicultural claims about the importance of culture in shaping our actions and identities, but that we should reach the opposite normative conclusion to that of multiculturalists and many liberals. Rather than using the idea of social construction to justify cultural respect or protection, we should use it to ground a critical stance toward cultural norms. 

 Since the publication of her book in 2008, Chambers has developed this critical stance on the absolute value of choice with regard to a number of harmful practices, two of which have been of particular concern to policymakers with whom she has worked: cosmetic surgery and UK marriage law. Chambers’ work on cosmetic surgery spans a number of articles developing critical insights first proposed in \[R1\]. In work that builds directly on her earlier book, she has challenged the idea that appeal to choice exonerates a number of suspect cosmetic surgical practices. For example, Chambers has argued that appealing to choice will not excuse Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery, on the grounds that the choice to undergo such surgery both disadvantages those who make it, and is made in response to identifiable pressures to choose the surgery \[R6\]. “Judging Women” \[R2\] brings together various aspects of the critique of choice, discussing the various uses and abuses of judgment. In related work, she has also argued that prohibition of infant circumcision and female genital cutting is consistent with liberal neutrality since prohibition recognises the reasonable disagreement around the practice \[R4\] and the principle of bodily integrity  \[R5\]. 

 In a very different area of application of the same underlying philosophical stance, Chambers has attracted a great deal of attention after the publication of her book *Against Marriage* \[R3\], in which she argues that state\-recognised marriage violates both equality and liberty and proposes a marriage\-free, egalitarian state in which religious or secular marriages are permitted but have no legal status. Part of her argument against marriage relies on a theory of social construction that Chambers first developed in her earlier book \[R1\]: even with the introduction of same\-sex marriage, the cultural norms that determine the meaning of marriage, and the racist and sexist history of marriage, mean that marriage remains an institution of inequality. As Chambers had previously suggested and in this later work argues in full, a woman’s choice to participate in such an institution cannot be just if that choice is subject to influence and disadvantages women.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact on and via the Nuffield Council on Bioethics** 

 Chambers’ research at the University of Cambridge led to an invitation from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics to be a member of its Working Party on Cosmetic Procedures, which produced a report in 2017 titled *Cosmetic Procedures: Ethical Issues* \[E1\]. Chambers’ academic work on feminism, gender, appearance, and choice has directly affected both her invitation to join the Working Party and the content of the report itself. Katharine Wright, the Assistant Director at the Nuffield Council confirms the nature and significance of Chambers’ contributions to their report on cosmetic procedures \[E2\]: 

 \[Chambers\] contributed substantially to the ethical analysis that underpins the practical policy recommendations contained within the report, particularly with reference to the importance of avoiding simplistic distinctions between ‘therapeutic’ and ‘cosmetic’ interventions, and the need to look more closely at the way social norms underpin many apparently therapeutic demands for interventions. Clare’s existing work in this area is cited in the report, and she was generous in sharing her thinking with the working group in discussion, and in helping formulate a consensus response. 

 Clare has also been active in disseminating our work since publication, including through citing the report in her own publications; and presenting the ethics framework of our report at a 2017 Royal Society of Medicine conference on ‘Changing the image of cosmetic surgery’. 

 The Cosmetic Procedures report included a number of recommendations to the Advertising Standards Authority \(ASA\) to improve its regulation of advertising that could increase social pressure to conform to an unrealistic body shape. These recommendations, partly based on Chambers’ ethical analysis of the way that social norms influence choice of surgery \[E1\], have had impact on the ASA, which has responded by publishing online advice to advertisers that they ‘should ensure that they don’t portray particular body types in an irresponsible manner’ \[E3\]. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons has also publicly supported Nuffield’s recommendation that the ASA play a more proactive role in regulating advertisement of cosmetic procedures \[E3\]. 

 The report has also had significant influence on the lobbying activity of the Nuffield Council, some of which has been led by Chambers herself. In recognition of her ongoing work with the Nuffield Council, she was appointed a Council member in March 2020. On 23 September 2020, Chambers gave evidence on behalf of the Nuffield Council to the Women and Equalities Select Committee Inquiry into Body Image. Among other things, Chambers drew attention to a number of Nuffield Council recommendations and was asked to provide more details in writing to the Committee \[E8\]. On 24 November 2020 she also contributed to a meeting of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group Inquiry on Beauty, Ethics, and Well\-Being. 

  

 Nuffield’s one\-year update on the impact of their report \[E3\] also notes a range of other consequent lobbying activity undertaken by Nuffield, including: meetings with government ministers; formal submissions to Government departments, parliamentary committees, and regulatory bodies; meetings with non\-governmental policy bodies; and questions raised in the House of Lords and the House of Commons. 

 **Impact on non\-academic medical professionals** 

 Chambers has presented her work directly to non\-academic audiences including clinicians, regulators, policy makers, activists, and lawyers. She has given three separate lectures, covering questions of freedom and social influence in the choice to undergo cosmetic surgery,  to professional associations of cosmetic and plastic surgeons: twice to the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive, and Aesthetic Surgeons \(BAPRAS\) in 2019, and once to the Royal Society of Medicine in October 2017. Her talks questioned whether the choice to undergo cosmetic surgery is really a free choice, and highlighted problems with the role that social norms play in the motivations of cosmetic surgery patients. In total these lectures were attended by more than 400 leading surgeons, clinical practitioners, and industry figures \(including the CEO of the largest cosmetic surgery company in the UK\) \[E4\]. 

 The President of BAPRAS has spoken highly of Chambers’ work and its impact on the profession. He writes: 

 <ins>‘</ins><ins>Without Dr Chambers's work many surgeons would not have thought to question the motivations of their patients, but would have seen their role as fundamentally to deliver the patients' requests for surgery. Many of our members have now modified their practice to include longer consultations, with deeper investigation into the patients' aims and hopes, and a greater willingness to explore alternatives to surgery together with their patients.</ins><ins>’</ins> <ins>Mark Henley</ins> <ins>\[E4\]</ins> 

 **Public engagement, leading to impact on UK law** 

 In addition to her work with policymakers and practitioners, Chambers has undertaken extensive public engagement work based both on her research on beauty norms and cosmetic surgery, and on her research on marriage. Her public engagement regarding the former has included a radio essay entitled ‘Rethinking the Body’ for *Rethink*, a BBC series of radio essays discussing how the world should change after the coronavirus pandemic.  Since its first broadcast on 24/5/2020, this essay has been featured and prompted further discussion on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour \(25/6/2020\) and Radio 5 Live’s Stephen Nolan Show \(29/6/2020\). Public engagement undertaken by Chambers around her book *Against Marriage* has included articles for *The New Statesman*, *Times Literary Supplement*, and *Aeon* \(the latter the most read *Aeon* article in the week of its publication, with 101,414 views and 4,522 Facebook shares \[E5\]\); interviews in *El País* and on podcasts *Talking Politics, Public Intellectual*, and *Philosophy 24/7,* and a wide range of public talks at e.g. the Hay Festival Segovia \(Spanish twin of the Hay\-on\-Wye Festival\), the Bigg Books speaker series in Newcastle upon Tyne, and the University of Cambridge Festival of Ideas \[E6\]. 

 One particularly significant consequence of this consciousness\-raising work was that Chambers’ research on marriage shaped Rebecca Steinfeld’s and Charles Keidan’s legal and political campaign to legalise different\-sex civil partnerships. In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favour of Steinfeld and Keidan in their case against the terms of the Civil Partnership Act 2004, which created the legal institution of civil partnerships for same\-sex couples but not for different\-sex couples. As a result, different\-sex civil partnerships became legal on 31 December 2019. 

 The arguments made in Chambers’ book *Against Marriage* were particularly significant for the campaign, and helped to improve Steinfeld and Keidan’s strategy on their way to success with the Supreme Court: 

 ‘Clare Chambers's work has definitely influenced our thinking and campaigning for Equal Civil Partnerships. \[…\] It also encouraged us to widen the campaign strategy to focus on choice and family stability more generally, something that helped us build the cross\-party consensus that was so crucial to the ultimate legislative success of our campaign. And as we drew the campaign to a close, I used the final media opportunities to push for that deeper conversation. For example, I recorded a Woman's Hour interview that was broadcast on New Year’s Eve 2019, as we were forming our civil partnership, with Clare's work in mind.’

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Ray Lee’s public kinetic sound art projects have had a widespread impact on public engagement with sound art and have influenced arts programming nationally and internationally. His work has also brought benefits to arts festivals and organisations, through the work’s unique combination of sound art and kinetic sculpture. Lee’s research has led to: 

-  the development of three new large\-scale public sound art projects; 

-  the touring of these projects to 49 discrete venues nationally and internationally 

-  511 public performances of the work; 

-  the presentation of the work to a live, in person, audience of estimated to be over 150,000 people worldwide. 

 Lee’s work has helped to build awareness and broaden public understanding of sound art as a medium and has contributed to urban regeneration through its inclusion in festivals located in economically disadvantaged areas and areas identified as lacking cultural provision. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Ray Lee is ‘a unique British artist whose work in the field of sound art is internationally significant’ \(Director of XTRAX, a UK based organisation that supports innovative UK outdoor performance work\). He is a previous winner of the British Composer Award for Sonic Art \(2012\) and received an honorary mention for Digital Music at Prix Ars Electronica \(2008\). His multi\-disciplinary arts projects described in this case study have achieved significant international recognition, with presentations in Australia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, South Korea and across Europe. He is a founding member of the Sonic Arts Research Unit \(SARU\) at Oxford Brookes University, which is an interdisciplinary group providing a forum for dialogue and exploration in experimental composition and sound art. 

 During this REF period, Lee has undertaken research that builds on *Siren*, which was the basis of his REF2014 impact case study. This new work has culminated in three significant sound art projects that explore the physical movement of sound through space by means of kinetic sound sculptures, and how this can provoke a sense of wonder in the participating audience. **\[R1\]** 

 **Chorus** 

 *Chorus* is a 27\-minute performance/composition for a set of fourteen five\-meter tall tripods with rotating arms, the ends of which carry loudspeaker horns. The rotation of the arms and the resulting physical distribution of the sound emitted from the speakers creates a spatial composition that is constantly changing. Although the form of the work was influenced by *Siren* the compositional structure was entirely different and the relationship of the performers/ operators to the work and the audience was also different. The work was developed through a practice\-based iterative process, working from the relatively smaller *Siren* tripods to the monumental *Chorus* tripods through a series of working prototypes and scratch performances. The composition and sound world was developed in response to both the materials used in the construction and the outdoor locations the work was designed for. *Chorus* was commissioned by Oxford Contemporary Music \(OCM\) in 2013 and supported by a grant from the Arts Council of England \(ACE\) also in 2013. **\[R2\] \[S5\]**

 **Ring Out** 

 Building on the success of *Chorus* as an internationally touring sound art project, Lee’s *Ring Out* was developed initially in response to a commission from the Performing Rights Society \(PRS\) Foundation for New Music \(GBP20,000\). It was shown initially in Hull for the City of Culture 2017 and then outside the Southbank Centre in London for the New Music Biennial Festival **\[S4\]**. It received additional funding from ACE \(GBP13,000\) and from OCM \(GBP8,000\). In researching and developing the work Lee was concerned with methods for engaging and captivating an audience of up to fifteen hundred people at a time in a predominantly sound\-based work. *Ring Out* takes the concept of traditional English Church bell ringing and reimagines it for the twenty\-first century as a series of eight five\-meter tall towers each with a suspended and pendulous loudspeaker horn. Each tower is ‘rung’ by a trained operator who makes the speaker swing to and fro. The distinctive movement of sound created by the swinging speakers generates a constantly changing sound world and a dynamic visual spectacle. In researching and developing the work Lee was concerned with methods for engaging and captivating an audience of up to fifteen hundred people at a time. *Ring Out* was commissioned by OCM and funded by PRS New Music Biennial 2017 and a grant from ACE. **\[R3\]** 

 **Congregation** 

 The research process for *Congregation* was undertaken over a six\-year period starting from a residency at the National Theatre Studio in London in 2012 and culminating in a research and development grant  \(GBP16,000\) from the Without Walls Consortium \(Arts Council funded\) in 2018. It received additional financial support from OCM \(GBP4,000\). Commissioned by Norwich and Norfolk Festival and Sea Change Arts the research started from the question: how can an audience be navigated through an unfamiliar location using sound alone? Although also designed for outdoor contexts, *Congregation* differs from *Chorus* and *Ring Out* in that it is directly participatory. The audience \(of up to 80 people per show\) arrive at discrete locations in a city where they are given a silver sphere and instructed that it will guide them to a location by emitting sounds. As the audience members walk off holding their sonic spheres, they find more people also carrying spheres until the sphere\-carrying participants have become a congregation moving inexorably towards their common destination. For the public, the sight of one person after another carrying a distinctive silver sonic sphere creates the sense of being in a performance that is taking place all around them. Uniquely, the mass of ‘singing’ spheres were used to generate an electronic musical composition at the final location, with the participants being the orchestral players. Lee designed and oversaw the manufacture of one hundred of these interactive spheres, with the software being developed in collaboration with artist and technologist Steve Symons. The project went into production in 2019 as the result of commissions from Norwich and Norfolk Festival, Sea Change Arts and funding from the Without Walls Consortium, and OCM. **\[R4\]**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Influencing curators and promotors of festivals and venues** 

 One of the principal beneficiaries of Lee’s research have been the festivals, venues and the curator/promoters of those festivals. His work has had a lasting impact on curatorial practice and programming philosophy in the outdoor arts sector, with the Director of the Warsaw Autumn International Festival of Contemporary Music commenting that “his work has broadened my knowledge of this kind of musical art” **\[S1a\],** and the Director of Soundlands stating that programming Ray Lee’s work “…has reinforced my belief in our programming ethos” **\[S1b\]**. The Director of the Stockton International Riverside Festival notes that Ray Lee “is one of the few artists producing original and interesting digital work for outdoor spaces as opposed to using digital technology as a superior replacement for analogue” **\[S1c\]**, and the Creative Director of IF, Milton Keynes International Festival states that “the experience of presenting Ray Lee’s work has helped in creating an audience for this work as it so well demonstrates creative engagement that can be open to all presented in highly public, non\-specialist or elitist venues” **\[S1d\]**. 

 Promoters have commented on how programming Lee’s work has helped generate a more significant relationship with their target audience. The Director of Soundlands states that, when programming, he seeks “a deeper interaction with the artist and local community, and to develop the artwork in context Ray was happy to do this and the project was immensely enhanced by the additional commission from Ray to create a sound work for the local community” **\[S1b\]**. He goes on to say, “ *Ring Out* is of a very high standard and its format enabled attendance of relatively high numbers for a timed performance. We often require artwork to be instantly engaging and accessible to a ‘general public’ audience. *Ring Out* met this requirement, providing an intriguing, eye\-catching spectacle in a busy festival environment.” **\[S1b\]** The Director or XTRAX discusses the advantages to curators of programming Lee’s work “Ray’s work *Chorus* was selected for many reasons. \(…\) As a sound/visual piece it can easily be presented in non\-English speaking countries – and it is very original, unlike any other work being developed by UK artists working in the outdoor arts sector. All in all it is very tourable internationally, from a practical perspective as well as meeting the highest international quality thresholds.” **\[S1e\]** While the Director of Lakes Alive \(in Kendal and the Lake District\) and Wye Valley talks about the confidence she feels in programming Lee’s work: “I know Ray’s work and trust it to be engaging, well\-crafted and presented to a high standard.” **\[S1f\]** 

 Promoter/curators and funders have responded very positively to Lee’s work as demonstrated by the increased profile that the work has enjoyed, the continued touring of works like *Chorus*, six years after its first performance *.* The work was programmed for Rijeka, European Capital of Culture, and SPILL festival in 2020 \(both postponed because of COVID19\) – examples of where the curators have previously programmed Lee’s *Siren* project and have now programmed *Chorus*. 

 **Building awareness and broadening public understanding of sound art** 

 Lee’s research has had a demonstrable impact on the wider public. At a conservative estimation, an audience of 150,000 people around the world have directly experienced Lee’s sound art practice. In the majority of cases, Lee’s projects have been presented to the public un\-ticketed and free of charge so precise audience figures are hard to gauge. However, audience figures at the festivals where the work has been presented indicate a very high level of attendance in the region of two million. The festivals where Lee has presented his work are, in the main, broad\-based arts festivals showing a wide range of art forms, and in many cases Lee’s work is the first instance that large scale outdoor sound art work has been shown in these major international contexts. It is also the case that this will have been the first contact that many audiences will have had with sound art. Director of the Warsaw Autumn International Festival of Contemporary Music describes *Chorus* as “art of high aesthetic value, and at the same time available to the public who did not identify with the history of European music. Because it is an outdoor event, calculated for a presentation in a place accessible for everyone, not just for the chosen and the initiated. In addition, it is an attractive, spectacular event, extremely unconventional” **\[S1a\].** 

 Audiences have responded very favourably to Lee’s research\-based sound art installations. Visitor feedback has indicated a high level of engagement in a form of work which was previously unfamiliar to them. Audience feedback for *Congregation* included comments such as: “It was amazing, really unique, never done anything like it before”; “For me that was incredible, when we all came together at the end sonically it was so beautiful. I’ve never seen anything like that and I’m inspired” **\[S2a\].** *Ring Out* audiences commented: “This was lovely \-other worldly, beautiful” and “really cool, interesting, different, moved me” **\[S2b\]**. Audiences at *Chorus* talked about how “You feel enveloped by the sound…you just feel like you’re in some sort of scientific fiction” and “I felt like I was floating and I couldn’t just stand still, I had to wonder around…it was a fascinating experience” **\[S2c\]**. 

 As with the other projects listed here *Chorus* has been shown in numerous contexts where the aim of the festival has been to bring high quality contemporary work to economically disadvantaged areas and contribute to urban regeneration initiatives. The Director of Stockton International Riverside festival **\[S1c\]** discusses how the work has enabled them to reach economically challenged audiences, but makes the more general point that: “all free open air festivals attract poor and disadvantaged audiences who either can’t afford or feel excluded from traditional venues.” As Director of SPILL Festival of Performance explains, “By siting the work in public spaces, accompanied by an easy to understand invitation to engage, it cuts across age, social divisions and language, to be nothing short of transformative” **\[S1g\]**. The Creative Director of IF, Milton Keynes International Festival explains how the choice of a public location made the work “far more accessible and with day and evening presentations really did attract a diverse audience. Outreach work that we had undertaken with schools encouraged children and young people from some of the most economically disadvantaged areas of Weymouth to enjoy the work,” **\[S1d\]**. 

 *Chorus* was displayed in Weymouth Pavilion Forecourt as part of the Inside Out Dorset Festival and b\-side festival in 2016. Weymouth Business Improvement District Manager said: “By supporting such an event this builds upon the culture and tourism links which aim to boost the local economy.” **\[S5\]** *Chorus* has been presented in Preston, Kendal, and Cheriton \(Folkestone\), in Deptford, Stratford, Edmonton and Hounslow in London as part of a Circulate London tour, as well as Hull, and Salford, Manchester. Director of Lieux Publics in Marseille describes: “Every time I presented Ray’s work, it was free shows, in public spaces, in working\-class neighbourhoods” **\[S1h\]**. It reached a wide audience at WOMAD 2014, and at New Scientist Live in London 2015. It has been shown internationally in Australia, France, Romania, Poland, South Korea, Malaysia and Hong Kong. In South Korea *Chorus* was presented in Seoul where Lee also led a three\-day sound art and environment workshop at the Seoul Street Arts Creation Centre **\[S3a\]**. 

 *Chorus* has been shown at 38 venues/festivals since its creation in Spring 2013, and 33 venues and festivals since summer 2013. *Chorus*, as a 27\-minute performance/composition, has been performed 428 times overall and 393 times since summer 2013. In late 2014 it was shortlisted \(as one of a shortlist of three\) for the British Composers Awards for Sound Art. An estimated live audience of 130,000 have witnessed the work directly. It was produced with a grant of £49k from the ACE, and financial support from OCM. The international touring of the work was supported by fee payments from festivals and through British Council support direct to the festivals. 

 *Ring Out* has been performed 28 times to an estimated live audience of 17,500 people. After the success of *Ring Out* in Hull, it as an exemplar when calling for a new sound art commission in Hull for 2019. *Ring Out* was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in a programme on the New Music Biennial in 2017. It went on to be shown in Oxford \(2017\), Llandudno \(2018\) and, for a socially distanced audience, at the Greenwich and Dockland International Festival in September 2020. During 2019 it was presented at nine UK and European festivals. It has had an estimated direct participatory audience of 2,500 and an estimated indirect audience \(i.e. members of the public who witnessed the spheres being carried through their town or city\) of many hundreds of thousands **\[S3b\]**. 

 Furthermore, Director of XTRAX noted: “ *Without Walls* has a touring network that spans many economically deprived areas of the UK, and the support of this network means that *Congregation* will tour to many deprived areas of England in the coming years.” **\[S1e\]** So far *Congregation* has been presented in Stockton, Yarmouth, Norwich, Kendal, Greenwich, Hull and Newbury in UK. 

 **Postscript** 

 The devastating effects Covid\-19 pandemic caused widespread cancellation of arts activities, including numerous performances of the works described here. However, a sign of Ray Lee’s reputation and significance is that *Chorus* and *Ring Out* were chosen to be part of the Greenwich and Dockland International Festival \(GDIF\) in September 2020. GDIF was the first major UK festival to take place after the national lockdown during the first half of 2020. “With the larger\-scale performances postponed until 2021, there is a far bigger emphasis on durational installations, including… Ray Lee’s astonishing kinetic *Chorus*.” \( *The Stage* 25/8/20\) **\[S4\]** *Chorus* was also presented in Stoke on Trent in October 2020. Senior Producer for arts organisation Appetite in Stoke\-on\-Trent said: “I’m particularly happy that we’ve been able to host Ray \[Lee\] here. I’m sorry I couldn’t do more with the weather or the Covid\-19 circumstances, but it’s felt even more important to do.” **\[S1i\]** In addition, *Congregation* was presented at La Strada Festival in Graz, Austria during September 2020, for a socially distanced audience **\[S3c\]**.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 New methods in computational fluid dynamics \(CFD\) developed by Prof Barakos have delivered enhancements in understanding of aircraft / wind turbine and aircraft / aircraft wake interactions that have: \(i\) impacted policy by defining new safe aircraft separations at major airports for fixed and rotary wing aircraft; and \(ii\) defined safe separations of aircraft and wind turbines. As a result, aircraft separations for landing and take\-off have been reduced at Europe’s largest airports, generating millions of pounds of additional revenue per year. The new CFD methods are now also embedded in the design and analysis of Leonardo’s current and future helicopters, providing unsurpassed capability and securing the future of their helicopter division.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Prof Barakos has researched methods to simulate flows around rotary wings of helicopters and wind turbines since his first appointment at UofG in 2001 \[3.1–3.6\]. The resulting UofG\-based CFD code was transferred to the University of Liverpool with Barakos in 2005 \[5.1\]. Barakos rejoined UofG in September 2015 and has continued to develop his body of work centred around the original UofG CFD code from his 2001–2005 appointment. His CFD methods have impacted the design of new aircraft and have led to new policy guidelines in the regulation of aircraft take\-off and landing at airports in the UK and Europe. 

 Barakos’ innovative research models the complex interaction between fluids and structures. For example, the blades of helicopters and wind turbines experience large structural deformations that affect their efficiency. The methods developed include modules to trim helicopter or wind turbine blades for specific conditions, with an accuracy that reduces the required number of expensive wind tunnel tests and prototypes. 

 **CFD research linked to wakes** 

 Barakos’ CFD research was identified by the Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\) as a key technology to allow safe separation criteria to be established between light aircraft and wind turbines, and between light fixed\-wing aircraft and helicopters \[3.1–3.4\]. Wakes are airflow disturbances produced by aircraft and wind turbines that have been implicated in aircraft crashes, where the aircraft inadvertently crossed a wake during landing. Such crashes triggered an investigation by the UK CAA using CFD, *in\-situ* measurements of wakes at East Midlands Airport and flight simulators to quantify the wake encounter hazard and produce pilot guidance. In 2015, this prompted *The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation* \(EUROCONTROL\) to use the Barakos CFD expertise at UofG to develop their *European Wake Turbulence Categorisation and Separation Minima on Approach and Departure* \(RECAT\-EU\). These are guidelines that detail the minimum separations that should exist between different types of aircraft, and the CFD work has enabled separation reductions at major airports. 

 **CFD in modelling flow around helicopters and tilt\-rotor blades** 

 Barakos’ work in CFD has given engineers from multinational aerospace company, Leonardo, the ability to model flows around rotary\-wing aircraft blades. His long\-standing research collaboration with Leonardo to develop advanced CFD methods began at UofG in 2001. An example is their work on the tiltrotor, a type of aircraft that combines the capabilities of aircraft and helicopters. The primary advantage is their vertical take\-off and landing capabilities, and they are faster than comparable helicopters. Work is ongoing to allow for efficient and competitive designs of tiltrotor vehicles to enter the market and be certified for civil operations. UofG research focused on blade design optimisation and performance using CFD, under the *Innovative Aerodynamic Design Solutions for High\-Performance Tiltrotor Aircraft* \(HIPERTILT\) project funded by Leonardo and Innovate UK \[3.5, 3.6\]. This research is now embedded in the ‘Helicopter Multi\-Block' \(HMB\) CFD tool, extensively used by Leonardo in their design and analysis of helicopters. Consequently, their engineers have the capability to optimise the shape of the tiltrotor wing and blades to deliver higher speed and better fuel utilisation.

1.  **Details of the impact** 

 Prof Barakos’ CFD research at UofG has delivered: a\) aircraft safety and policy changes; b\) increased airport capacity; c\) enhanced design and analysis capability at Leonardo. 

 <ins>Impacts on CAA</ins> <ins>policy</ins> <ins>guidance</ins> <ins>and enhanced safety</ins> 

 Barakos’ CFD research expertise, founded on work from his initial UofG appointment \[5.1\], has directly led to new guidance from the CAA in the CAP 764 document, *‘CAA Policy and Guidelines on Wind Turbines’* \(2016\), stating that light aircraft pilots should remain 5 rotor diameters away from wind turbines with diameter of less than 30m \[5.2 pp32–34, 5.3\]. This is a new rule based entirely on Barakos’ research. This policy influences the activity of aircraft pilots, wind farm developers, local planning authorities and farmers using crop\-spraying aircraft operating close to the ground and near wind turbines \[5.2, 5.3\]. The guidance enhances the safety of all parties and outlines a means of approving planning of wind farm development \[5.2 p38\]. This is important to the UK government as it tries to balance priorities of safety, renewable energy and the economic importance of aviation to the UK \[5.2 p8\]. 

 Barakos’ research featuring CFD to understand the effects of wakes has been adopted by EUROCONTROL to develop RECAT\-EU \(European Wake Turbulence Categorisation and Separation Minima on Approach and Departure\) \[5.3, 5.4\]. In September 2015, RECAT\-EU guidelines, which replaced previous wake vortex separation rules, were informed by Barakos’ CFD models of aircraft separations to define new safe aircraft separations \[5.3, 5.4 p7 para 6\]. RECAT\-EU has been adopted by air traffic control in Europe’s largest airports, including Paris Charles de Gaulle \(CDG\) where RECAT\-EU has been operating 24/7 since March 2016 \[5.5, 5.6\]. Heathrow, Schiphol, Leipzig\-Halle and Le Bourget also use RECAT\-EU. Deployment has enhanced airport safety and capacity, resulting in a significant increase of aircraft movements \[5.6, slide 4\]. 

 Barakos’ research and the RECAT\-EU guidelines also enable helicopters to blend efficiently and safely with fixed\-wing traffic \(the US equivalent of RECAT\-EU does not allow this\), promoting better use of airports and higher safety standards. Recognising this, Barakos was awarded funding for a research project from the *Network for Innovative Training on Rotorcraft Safety* \(NITROS; 2017\) \[5.7\], focussed on using CFD and resulting wake information to determine the safe proximity of aircraft to wind turbines \[5.6\]. 

 <ins>Enhanced</ins> <ins>d</ins><ins>esign</ins> <ins>c</ins><ins>apability</ins> <ins>at Leonardo</ins> 

 Barakos’ blade optimisation research \(HIPERTILT\) programme has provided high fidelity CFD design tools which allow engineers at Leonardo to explore new design concepts in the development of tiltrotor aircraft \[5.8, p1 para 4\]. The tiltrotor vehicle is a concept that with modern technology is set to change the way we fly, covering the gap between helicopters and fixed\-wing aircraft in range and speed. Tiltrotor vehicles present capabilities to emergency and relief operations including air\-ambulances and the distribution of humanitarian aid. This vehicle has been the top priority in the UK National Aerodynamics Committee agenda and top priority for Leonardo within CleanSky and CleanSky2 \(EU programmes developing innovative technology to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft\) \[5.8, p1\]. Barakos’ UofG research was shared with Leonardo to enable optimal rotor analysis and design \[5.8, p2 para 1\]. Within the HIPERTILT project, training sessions for Leonardo engineers ensured that new designs were tested using Barakos’ CFD tools \[5.8, p2 ‘Approach to Impact’\]. The 700 tiltrotor engineers are part of a team of 3,000 Leonardo staff working in Yeovil \(Somerset, UK\) \[5.8, p1 para 3\]. The relationship with Prof Barakos at UofG is ‘strategically important’ to Leonardo \[5.8, p3 para 5\], securing their future and the UK’s tiltrotor industry. 

 <ins>Increased</ins> <ins>a</ins><ins>irport</ins> <ins>c</ins><ins>apacity</ins> 

 RECAT\-EU allows airports to recover more rapidly from adverse weather conditions and can increase runway throughput by over 5% \[5.4 p21\]. RECAT\-EU has increased the number of aircraft taking off from European airports, which is linked directly to considerable economic impacts. The Director of Navigation Services for Paris CDG explained that the airport now has an increased throughput of aircraft \[5.9\]. “We are very proud of having deployed this new operational concept at one of the busiest airports in Europe. This project is the result of close cooperation with EUROCONTROL. It has brought quick wins in terms of safety and capacity: thanks to RECAT\-EU, runway throughput at Paris\-CDG has increased by 2−4 aircraft movements per hour at peak periods.” Given that each flight landing and taking off from CDG must pay a fee in the region of EUR400, CDG alone has seen an increased annual revenue of several million euros from RECAT\-EU \[5.10 p1\]. Similarly, Heathrow have an average of an extra 17 aircraft movements per day \(6,205 movements/year\), generating increased revenue from RECAT\-EU \[5.11, p19\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Imperial College researchers have taken bronchoscopic lung volume reduction techniques for people with severe emphysema from proof\-of\-concept, through first\-in\-man case series and randomised controlled trials demonstrating clinically significant improvements in lung function, breathlessness, exercise capacity, quality of life and survival, to an established place in both NICE and international guidelines for COPD management. The team established a national register and identified inequalities of access, which, combined with evidence of effectiveness and value, led to approval for Specialist Commissioning by NHS England in November 2020, allowing treatment for thousands of breathless and disabled COPD patients with otherwise irreversible disease.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 There are 1,300,000 people with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \(COPD\) in the UK. In selected patients with lung hyperinflation due to emphysema, surgical removal of the worst affected area of lung reduces gas trapping and allows the relatively healthy areas of lung to function more effectively. Around 1% of COPD patients are suitable to benefit from this technique. Lung volume surgery involves resecting target lung – it is effective, but little used because of concerns over morbidity and cost. 

 Researchers at Imperial College London have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of an alternative approach, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction, as a treatment for emphysema through case series, physiological studies and definitive randomised controlled trials. 

 Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction is achieved by placing endobronchial valves into the airways supplying the target lobe of lung. These allow air to leave but not enter, causing the target lobe to collapse and facilitating safe lung volume reduction. The approach is less invasive than surgery and can be more widely applied with less risk of morbidity and mortality with a reduction in usage of healthcare resources. 

 The Imperial College team conducted the first randomised controlled trial \(RCT\) of lung volume reduction surgery \(LVRS\) which proved the concept that lung volume reduction for people with emphysema improved breathlessness, quality of life and exercise capacity \(1\). The researchers then demonstrated, in the first case series describing the use of endobronchial valves for lung volume reduction, that they could be placed safely and that the procedure improved lung function \(2\). 

 Further work in clarifying the importance of achieving lobar occlusion demonstrated that endobronchial valves reduced dynamic hyperinflation during exercise and that this was associated with a substantial improvement in exercise capacity, particularly in individuals where radiological atelectasis \(where the target area of lung collapses down\) was demonstrated \(3\). The team established the importance of careful patient selection \- if emphysema has broken down the barriers between lobes, collateral ventilation occurs, and valve placement is ineffective because air can still get into the target lobe from adjacent lung. 

 The team of researchers also demonstrated a survival benefit with successful valve placement \(4\), which is important given the absence of treatments that alter the natural history of COPD. They also established the beneficial impact of lung volume reduction \(a\) in improving oxygen kinetics because lung hyperinflation impedes cardiac function and \(b\) on ventilatory synchrony, using the novel, non\-invasive optoelectronic plethysmography technique. 

  

 The Imperial College team went on to perform the first double\-blind BeLieVeR\-HIFi RCT of valve placement, funded by the NIHR\-MRC EME programme \(5\), and to lead the TRANSFORM multicentre RCT \(6\). These studies confirmed clinically significant benefits in quality of life, breathlessness, lung function and exercise capacity. 

 The work of these researchers within the field of advanced therapies for emphysema have also demonstrated that LVRS can be conducted more safely in modern practice and that access to lung volume reduction techniques is highly inequitable, underling the importance of the decision of NHS England \(NHSE\) to support specialist commissioning.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 COPD, the third leading cause of death globally after cardiovascular disease and cancer is a combination of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. In emphysema, the alveolar walls and small airways are destroyed, causing the lung tissue to become baggy and trap air. This gas trapping increases the work of breathing, restricts vital capacity and cardiac function and manifests as disabling breathlessness, impaired ability to do physical activity, reduced capacity to withstand acute exacerbations of the condition and premature death. Inhaled medication can relieve symptoms but does not alter the natural history of the disease and lung hyperinflation has been an intractable problem. 

 There are an estimated 16,000 people in the UK and 660,000 in Europe, who might be eligible for a lung volume reduction procedure, equating to approximately 1% of people with COPD. These procedures, indicated in patients with severe COPD who are highly symptomatic, improve breathlessness, exercise capacity and quality of life, as well as prolonging survival in a condition that is otherwise progressive and relentless. The scale of benefit with lung volume reduction is dramatic and typically far exceeds those seen with inhaled medications. 

  

 Initial case series investigations by the Imperial team generated a body of work on the physiological mechanisms and data on mortality benefit from successful valve placement \- previously the only other interventions shown to improve survival in COPD were smoking cessation and supplemental oxygen in individuals with respiratory failure. 

  

 This led to funding of the BeLieVeR\-HIFi trial, the first device study supported by the NIHR\-MRC EME programme. The results of this RCT and the individual patient meta\-analysis performed by the Imperial team, combined with data from the Dutch STELVIO trial, informed a Cochrane review \[ **A**\]. Importantly the improvements in quality of life seen were double that observed with inhaled medication. Collectively this formed the evidence base on which the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) health technology appraisal \[IPG600\] approved the use of endobronchial valve placement within the NHS in 2017 \[ **B**\]. These data also informed international guidelines and clinical practice, with their inclusion in the international GOLD COPD guidelines. 

  

 These data, together with that from the Imperial\-led multi\-centre TRANSFORM trial contributed to the NICE COPD guideline committee making a clear recommendation that endobronchial valve therapy should be offered to appropriately selected patients in 2018 \(NG115 recommendation 1.2.88\) \[ **C**\]. The decision was supported by data estimating the cost per quality\-adjusted life years of endobronchial valve placement at approximately £22,500, putting it within an acceptable range for NICE \[ **D**\]. 

 This evidence of efficacy together with data gathered on inequity of access to the procedures led NHSE to approve endobronchial valve placement for Specialist Commissioning \(November 2020\) so that all patients within the NHS who are suitable should be able to access it \[ **E**\]. 

 Data from the UKLVR registry show that our work has led to 14 centres performing LVR procedures in the UK with around 500 lung volume reduction procedures performed since 2017. The Specialist Commissioning with associated funding and support for referral pathways, will lead to a substantial further increase in patient access and benefit. 

 Endobronchial valve placement is also now recognised in international guidelines for the management of COPD \(e.g. the GOLD guidelines 2020, p63, “endobronchial valve placement shows comparable benefits to LVRS but with fewer complications”\), meaning that the impact has been global \[ **F**\]. According to the website of one valve manufacturer >19,000 emphysema patients worldwide have already undergone an endobronchial valve placement procedure using their product \[ **G**\]. Another manufacturer, Olympus, estimates that globally over 11,000 patients have been treated using their valve product \[ **H**\]. 

 The UK Taskforce for Lung Health states that lung volume reduction procedures remain an underused therapy. Newer and less invasive lung volume reduction technologies, such as valves, broaden the pool of eligible people to as many as 16,300 people in England who could benefit from such a procedure \[ **I**\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Marine litter is playing a detrimental role in modern life and changing human behaviour is essential to avoid it. In the past, policy makers addressing pollution have typically focused on evidence of harm. Pahl at the University of Plymouth \(UoP\) has integrated ground\-breaking psychological research on marine pollution into science advice, thereby introducing knowledge of risk perception, risk communication and behaviour into UK policy \(DEFRA\), EU policy and the United Nations Environment Programme. In addition, UoP’s evidence of the effectiveness and well\-being benefits of marine litter schemes enabled local governments and charities to increase participation and leverage funds of over £700,000. Furthermore, UoP’s evidence of the effectiveness of the Fishing for Litter scheme has led to new marine litter schemes in Hong Kong, China, Canada, the Pacific Region and Europe thereby increasing environmental action across the globe.

### 1.  Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2010, Prof. Sabine Pahl started working with Richard Thompson OBE \(Marine Sciences\) and the International Marine Litter Research Unit \(awarded Queen’s Anniversary Prize 2019\) at University of Plymouth \(UoP\). This research explored the integration of marine and psychology perspectives initially in the context of risks and benefits of visiting rocky shores. This research identified behaviours high in emotional benefit to visitors and low in risk to the environment, which should be encouraged \(e.g., swimming, wildlife watching\) as opposed to behaviours low in emotional benefit to visitors and high in risk, which should be managed \(e.g., bait collection, fossil hunting\). Continuing this focus on the interplay between exposure to natural environments and their potential degradation and pollution, the team then illustrated how degraded marine environments have the potential to undermine psychological well\-being benefits derived from coastal visits, specifically showing that post\-consumer litter has worse effects than fishing litter.  The team then demonstrated in an experimental field study that beach cleans combine clear well\-being benefits to humans \(especially eudaemonic i.e., reward\- and meaning\-related well\-being\) with reducing litter in the environment – a benefit to nature \[3.1\]. 

 This interdisciplinary research continued within the EU FP7\-funded MARLISCO project \(2012\-2015\), in an analysis of predictors of behaviour change and of marine litter education \[3.2\]. The team applied a behaviour change framework to marine litter education and demonstrated that children changed their marine litter\-related behaviour following an interactive event. This demonstrated the importance of psychological above sociodemographic factors in predicting behavioural intentions in a large\-scale European social survey \[3.3\]. This approach was continued in the H2020 ResponSEAble project, which found changed attitudes and intentions in, for example, shipping trainees following an educational intervention. 

 Supported by an Institute for Sustainability Solutions Research small grant, the team then focused on the emerging issue of microplastics and conducted a small\-scale qualitative study on microbeads in cosmetics. This demonstrated how alarmed different groups of respondents were when they handled microplastics isolated from cosmetic products and how they spontaneously asked what they could do to improve the problem \[3.4\].  Subsequently, Pahl illustrated the breadth of research methods within social and behavioural sciences and how these may be applied to the issue of environmental microplastics to a wider interdisciplinary audience \[3.5\]. Of note, this is the first paper with a focus on behavioural / social sciences to be published in a Royal Society of Chemistry methods journal. 

 In July 2019, the team received funding from the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\) to evaluate the Fishing for Litter \(FfL\) programme. They evaluated the effectiveness and co\-benefits of the project that aims to reduce amount of litter in the north east Atlantic. The effects on the participating fishers themselves was studied including their perceptions and waste\-related behaviours \(both at work and at home\). The study was unique as it focused on the behavioural change of fishers, which reinforced that the scheme changes the behaviour of fishers and that this long\-term behavioural change spills into their home life as well as at sea.\[3.6\]

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Protecting marine environments, marine litter and microplastics have previously been the focus of the natural sciences. However, with plastics playing such a detrimental role in modern life, changing human behaviour is essential for mitigating further harm. UoP research into perceptions and behaviour change has resulted in policy action towards acknowledging the role of society and the realisation that these complex problems require interdisciplinary integrated analysis. Furthermore, their evidence has supported local governments and charities with their strategic aim of reducing marine litter. UoP research has put the human dimension and role of behavioural science approaches firmly on the agenda in the context of these marine environmental issues. 

 **Integrating Psychology and Behavioural Approaches into policy** 

1.  United Nations 

 Pahl’s research has informed policy debates on finding effective solutions to environmental challenges. In 2015 and 2016, Pahl was one of two psychologists representing behavioural sciences in the Working Group 40 \(WG40\) on microplastics of the Joint Group of Experts on Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution \(GESAMP\) which is sponsored by several United Nations Agencies. The first GESAMP WG40 2015 report included Pahl’s review of risk perception and communication processes and the 2016 GESAMP WG40 report additionally included the role of behaviour change based on Pahl’s research \[1\]. It concluded with the recommendation that the field needed behavioural science input in order to find effective solutions that integrate the human dimension into this environmental problem \[5.1\]. Pahl’s review findings within the reports informed policy debate through the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN whose recommendations included strengthening education and awareness measures on marine litter by providing educational and outreach materials targeted to specific interest groups and range of ages to promote behavioural change \[5.2\]. In addition, the report informed a G20 Insights policy brief report \[5.3\] and Seafish, the UK public body which supports the seafood industry, who concluded that from a seafood industry perspective there was a need to influence human attitudes and behaviours to meaningfully reduce the sources of microplastic litter \[5.4\]. 

 At the UN Environmental Assembly in Nairobi \(May 2016\), Pahl’s research on the behaviour perspective was integrated into the resolution on marine plastic litter and microplastics, which was agreed by the 193 UN member states. Policy recommendations included improved governance at all levels as well as behavioural and system changes such as the promotion of measures to reduce plastic material use to ensure a more sustainable production and consumption pattern and encouraging governments to promote change in individual and corporate behaviour \[5.5\]. 

 Pahl was invited back to the GESAMP group in 2020 and contributed a summary of the role of human decisions and behaviours in the plastics system \[5.6\]. This resulted in her leading a stocktaking exercise on all actions addressing marine plastic litter and microplastics funded by the UN Environment Programme \(UNEP\). This is the first time UNEP has run such an ambitious stock take using quantitative social science methods. 

 Pahl’s research resulted in the development of targeted messages to help reduce human impacts on the world’s coral reefs. In 2017, Pahl contributed to a workshop on how to harness citizen behaviour to aid the protection of coral reef ecosystems, hosted by UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre in partnership with UN Environment, Pierre\-Yves Cousteau \(CEO of Cousteau Divers\), and Reef World Foundation. This workshop served to inform the UN Environment global campaign of citizen behaviour change and the International Coral Reef Initiative. 

1.  European Commission, the G7 and UK national level policy 

 Previously, social and behavioural sciences had not been valued or considered within the European actions required to protect the marine environment. Pahl was appointed as vice chair to the European Commission’s Science Advice for Policy by European Academies \(SAPEA\) group \(2015\-2019\) and co\-led an evidence review which resulted in recommendations that research efforts be directed towards the study of individual and collective behaviour. This report clearly emphasised the value of the Social and Behavioural Sciences and informed the scientific opinion of the EU’s Chief Scientific Advisors.  In addition, Pahl’s contributions to the G7 Roundtable on Microplastics \(Oct 2019\) resulted in a strong recommendation that the field of behavioral sciences should be mobilized \[5.7\]. At a UK national policy level, UoP research was included in a Houses of Parliament POSTnote \(2016\) that stressed the important role of prevention and the co\-benefits of pro\-environmental action such as taking parts in beach cleans.\[5.8\]

##  Summary of the impact 

 Fowle’s research into the notion of ‘peripheral’ impressionisms has led to large\-scale international exhibitions with three major impacts: 

 1. Economic impact: boosting the market for the work of the exhibited artists and generating revenue for arts institutions through catalogue sales and high visitor numbers \(over 518,000 in total\). 

 2. Influencing curatorial strategies: prompting art institutions to reassess the importance of Impressionist art produced outside France and adopt a more global perspective. 

 3. Shaping public perceptions of Impressionism: introducing previously overlooked artists to new and diverse audiences and stimulating media, critical and public discourse. 
","
##  Underpinning research 

 Fowle’s transnational approach to Impressionism has brought to light global networks of artists, critics, dealers and exhibitions in France, Britain, the USA and the Nordic countries \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]. This has led her to develop the notion of ‘peripheral impressionisms’ \- ‘those impressionisms located outside France and … those artists side\-lined in earlier histories of Impressionism’ \[3.1\]. 

 The research challenges established scholarship that has tended to focus on France and canonical male artists. The concept of peripheral impressionism has enabled Fowle to propose strong alternatives to these dominant discourses, which: 

 1. Acknowledge inter\- and transnational artistic and art\-critical networks operative across Britain, Europe and the USA between the 1870s and the First World War, and artistic adaptations of Impressionism in relation to national styles. 

 2. Re\-evaluate artists within France previously not associated with Impressionism, or hitherto considered ‘minor’, such as Charles\-François Daubigny. 

 Her research has revealed that Impressionism evolved into a more complex, hybrid style than previously acknowledged, one with national variations. 

 Fowle’s insights into such dynamics have afforded exciting scholarly and curatorial potentials and new ways to engage the public. This was demonstrated by the two high\-profile exhibitions that she organised in her capacity as Senior Curator at the Scottish National Gallery, to which she is seconded. 

 American Impressionism: A New Vision 1880\-1900 was a collaboration with the Terra Foundation for American Art in Chicago and the Musée des Impressionnismes, Giverny \[3.4\]. The exhibition explored the origins of American Impressionism, relations between American artists and Europe, issues of national identity and the American market for and critical reception of French Impressionism. It opened at the Musée des Impressionnismes \(28 March 2014 – 29 June 2014\), with the adjusted title, *L’impressionnisme et les Américains*. The next stage at the National Galleries of Scotland \(NGS\) \(19 July – 19 Oct 2014\) was the first time that the work of the American Impressionists had been shown in Britain. The exhibition then travelled to the Thyssen Bornemisza Museum, Madrid \(4 Nov 2014 – 1 Feb 2015\), with the title *Impressionismo Americano*. Fowle was co\-curator, author of one of the two main essays in the catalogue \(fully illustrated in colour and published in English, French and Spanish\) and lead curator for the National Galleries of Scotland presentation. 

 Inspiring Impressionism: Daubigny, Monet, Van Gogh was presented at the Taft Museum, Cincinnati \(20 Feb – 29 May 2016\), the National Galleries of Scotland \(25 June – 2 Oct 2016\) and the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam \(21 Oct 2016 – 29 Jan 2017\) \[3.5\]. The exhibition was the first ever monographic show of Daubigny. It explored intersections between naturalism and French Impressionism, and the impact of the market and softer networks of influence in artist colonies outside Paris. Fowle was project leader at all of these venues. She was lead curator in Edinburgh, co\-author and editor of the exhibition catalogue \(published in English, French and Spanish\) and author of a second book, *Daubigny and Impressionism*, which summarised key research insights for general audiences and therefore helped facilitate impact \[3.6\].

 **4.** Details of the impact 

 Fowle’s research has generated economic, cultural and profile\-raising impact for museums and boosted the market for the work of the exhibited artists. The two exhibitions based on this research, *American Impressionism* and *Inspiring Impressionism*, were notable popular successes attracting over 518,000 visitors in total \[5.4\]. They have introduced new and wider audiences to little\-known artists and stimulated debate about received ideas of Impressionism among academics, curators, the press and the public. 

####  1. Economic impact 

 Both exhibitions raised the profile of peripheral impressionist artists and boosted the market for their work. Following *Inspiring Impressionism*, auction prices for Daubigny’s paintings increased substantially, with examples of his work selling for double or three times the estimate. On 31 October 2017 a *plein\-air* sketch by Daubigny, *Vue du Château Gaillard*, with an estimate of USD25,000\-35,000, fetched USD75,000 at Christie’s New York. On 22 May 2018, a Daubigny *Orchard*, similar to those shown in the exhibition, sold at Sotheby’s New York for nearly three times the estimate \(USD30\-50,000; hammer price USD137,500\). On 26 November 2018, another Daubigny study, *Les plaines d’Auvers, travaux dans les champs,* with an estimate of EUR35,000\-40,000 sold at the Hôtel Drouot in Paris for EUR88,400 \[5.1\]. The above sale prices are highly unusual, since all three auction houses are experienced at setting realistic estimates and Daubigny’s work had never previously achieved such high prices. James Mackinnon, Member of the Society of London Art Dealers, confirmed that *Inspiring Impressionism* contributed to ‘a stronger appreciation within the commercial art market of the outstanding importance of Daubigny’ \[5.2\]. 

 The exhibitions generated economic and profile\-raising benefit for the cultural institutions involved. This was evident from the sponsorship, ticket and catalogue sales and related retail activity. *American Impressionism* received USD600,000 funding from the Terra Foundation \[5.3\], more than any other exhibition in the history of National Gallery of Scotland. It received 100,000 visitors at the Musée des Impressionnismes, achieving record attendance for that summer period compared to previous exhibitions at the museum \[5.4\]. Catalogue sales in Edinburgh \(nearly 2,000 copies\) were higher than any other exhibition that year, generating GBP35,600 \(41% of the NGS’s publishing annual income\) \[5.5\]. 

 *Inspiring Impressionism* was seen by 321,773 visitors worldwide, of which 238,474 were in Amsterdam \[5.4\]. Visitor figures were 63,160 in Edinburgh, larger than any other paying exhibition over a five\-year period \[5.4\]. Visitor figures in Cincinnati were 20,139, ‘an all\-time record for an exhibition at the Taft’ \[5.4\]. The catalogue and Fowle’s book *Daubigny and Impressionism* sold nearly 5,000 copies in total \[5.5\]. With a related boost in wider retail sales, the exhibition was one of the two most successful for the National Gallery of Scotland that year, generating GBP76,517 in catalogue sales alone \(57% of the gallery’s publishing income\) \[5.5\]. Christopher Baker, Director of European and Scottish Art and Portraiture at the National Gallery of Scotland, confirmed that since 2014 Fowle’s exhibitions have made ‘a significant contribution towards the public programme’, ‘raising the institution’s profile \[…\] as well as attracting research funding and corporate sponsorship’, and have had ‘a huge impact on areas of the Galleries such as retail \[…\] and restaurant and have boosted visits to the website’ \[5.3\]. 

 **2.** Shaping curatorial approaches to Impressionism 

 As a result of *American Impressionism*, Fowle was invited to lead public symposia on the American artist George Bellows at the Barber Institute, Birmingham \(3\-4 November 2016\) and on global Impressionism at the National Gallery, London \(25 February 2017\) \[5.6\]. Through her direct consultation with an international network of curators, Fowle’s transnational approach to Impressionism has influenced other major exhibitions and their nomenclature. These included *The Glasgow Boys: Scottish Impressionism* \(Drents Museum, Assen, 2015\-16\) \[5.7\] and *Van Gogh and Britain* \(Tate Britain, 2019\) \[5.7\], in which works by Van Gogh were juxtaposed with works by Scottish artists. 

 The foregrounding of the American\-born impressionist artist Mary Cassatt in the marketing of the *American Impressionism* exhibitions in France and Spain appears to have prompted a change in attitude amongst French curators. In 2014, the French museum world rejected the title ‘American Impressionism’ for the exhibition at Giverny \(instead opting for the title *L’impressionnisme et les Américains*\) on their understanding that Impressionism was primarily a French phenomenon. However, by 2018, the *Mary Cassatt* exhibition at the Jacquemart\-André Museum in Paris was marketed as ‘An American Impressionist in Paris’. This was a significant departure from the customary representation of Cassatt as part of the French Impressionist circle. 

####  3. Shaped public perceptions of Impressionism, introducing previously overlooked artists to new and diverse audiences and stimulating media, critical and public discourse 

 The exhibitions sparked extensive press response and public debate around Impressionism, national styles and the evaluation of canonical artistic movements. Reviews praised *American Impressionism* at the National Gallery of Scotland as a ‘sparkling exhibition’ \( *The Financial Times*\), an ‘astonishing show’ \( *The Herald*\) and ‘planted with surprises’ \( *The Observer*\) \[5.8\]. Critics noted that it challenged existing ideas about Impressionism: *Country Life Magazine* commended it for shedding light ‘on artists little known outside America’, while *The* *Independent* identified as ‘brave’ and ‘rewarding’ the decision to juxtapose American and European works \[5.8\]. 

 Visitors to *American Impressionism* enjoyed being introduced to unfamiliar artists: ‘Some beautiful paintings by painters I’d never heard of’; ‘I never considered Sargent to be an Impressionist till today’ \[5.10\]. A varied accompanying programme of educational events ensured the broadest possible reach, including guided tours for school and university groups, events for community groups including those living with dementia and practical workshops for adults. Fowle’s lectures and guided tours attracted particular praise, a typical comment being: ‘your brilliantly effortless talk was fascinating, entertaining and revelatory’ \[5.9\]. 

 *Inspiring Impressionism* was selected as a critics’ choice by over eight major international publications, receiving a five\-star review in *The* *Scotsman*, four\-star reviews in *The Telegraph* and the *List*, and coverage in the *New York Times*. Reviewers praised it as ‘that rare thing, an exhibition that tells us something new about the Impressionists’ \( *Apollo*\), ‘full of surprises’ \( *The Herald*\), a ‘fascinating exhibition \[that\] offers a genuinely fresh perspective’ \( *The Scotsman*\), and an invitation ‘to rethink the origins of Impressionism’ \( *The Burlington Magazine*\) \[5.9\] *.* Visitors appreciated learning about Daubigny: ‘Daubigny was just a name to most of us but not now … a magnificent exhibition’ \[5.10\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Economic growth is important but is often coupled with increasing carbon emissions. The move to a cleaner, low\-carbon economy is a central pillar of national and international economic and climate strategies. Small and Medium Enterprises \(SMEs\) play a key role in the UK economy and have great ambition to support clean economic growth but have limited capability, capacity and funds for research and development. The Centre for Global Eco\-Innovation, subsequently the Low Carbon Eco\-Innovatory, are award\-winning centres for delivering low\-carbon innovation across SMEs in Liverpool City Region and the North West.  Our centres have provided small businesses with dedicated researchers and access to world\-leading expertise and facilities, thus enabling the translation of ideas from the drawing board into new, marketable products and services. This body of industry\-focussed research and development has achieved low\-carbon growth by assisting over 300 businesses, delivering energy and resource savings, and generating a minimum of 51 new, eco\-innovative products and services. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 World\-wide, carbon emissions are contributing substantially to global warming and climate change, both of which impact on the health and longevity of populations and the planet. The move to low\-carbon economic growth has been identified as “one of the greatest industrial opportunities of our time” \(BEIS, 2019 – The Grand Challenges policy paper\). The opportunity for this is greatest for Small and Medium Enterprises \(SMEs\) as they are agile and often find it easier to adopt new business practices that lead to efficiency and sustainability gains. However, SMEs have limited capacity for innovation research and development, and lack facilities and expertise. Our research responds to these dual challenges, establishing ways to achieve low\-carbon growth amongst SMEs via the Centre for Global Eco\-Innovation and Low Carbon Eco\-Innovatory. Research led by staff in UoA14 at the University of Liverpool has provided important detail on the context and delivery mechanisms for achieving low\-carbon economic growth, as well as metrics and tools for assessing their success \(theme A\). Further, within UoA14 at the University of Liverpool, the impact of the underpinning research to support SMEs in their low\-carbon ambitions centres specifically on the development of products and services for coastal monitoring \(theme B\). 

 **A: The Eco\-Innovation Model.** The Centre for Global Eco\-Innovation \(2012\-2015\) and the Low Carbon Eco\-Innovatory \(2015\-present\) established an effective and well\-received mechanism \(as viewed by both funders and recipients\) for delivering low\-carbon growth through European structural funding **\[3.1\];** a life\-cycle assessment method for quantifying the resource savings and environmental benefits of products and services arising from European structural funding projects **\[3.2\];** and providing the wider academic community with critical insights into the motivation of ‘green entrepreneurs’ **\[3.3\]**. Equipping SMEs with an understanding of what is needed to achieve low\-carbon growth through this research, while also developing research\-led tools to evaluate their success, are critical insights identified within research led by University of Liverpool \(UoA14\) staff. 

 **B: Exemplifying SME\-specific research led by the University of Liverpool.**  Research staff in UoA14 supported Marlan Maritime Technologies Ltd. and MM Sensors Ltd. in the development and implementation of two eco\-innovative products and services that focus on coastal change monitoring. Research undertaken in the Centre for Global Eco\-Innovation by Prof. Andy Plater in UoA14, Paul Bell at the National Oceanography Centre, and Dr Cai Bird from 10/2012 to 10/2015 enabled the development and validation of a novel approach to mapping the morphology of intertidal areas **\[3.4\]**. Traditionally a logistical challenge, time\-consuming and expensive, our research addressed this using a time series of X\-band radar images. The new monitoring tool also reveals long\-term and event–based changes in coastal deposition and erosion that threaten safe port navigation, reduce the effectiveness of coastal defence schemes and increase physical and economic vulnerability to coastal flooding **\[3.5\]**. From 11/2015 to 11/2019, Low Carbon  Eco\-Innovatory support for MM Sensors led to the development of new low\-cost tide gauges based on the use of global positioning systems data and the near real\-time transmission of pressure gauge data using an Internet\-of\-Things methodology **\[3.6\]**. The impact of these new tide gauges is improved spatial accuracy from the radar monitoring surveys, with the capacity to support monitoring programs in Small Island Developing States that are current paused due to COVID\-19.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of research is seen in two areas, 1. <ins> **delivering successful interventions and tools for low\-carbon growth**</ins> that facilitate the development of a low\-carbon economy in the Northwest and Liverpool City Region, and 2. <ins> **new, low\-carbon products and services**</ins> that have led to increased market share, employment and environmental credentials for SMEs. 

##  <ins>1.</ins> <ins>Interventions and Tools</ins> 

 Impact has been realized in the development, implementation and recognition of an award\-winning business\-support approach that utilizes structural funds to successfully support small businesses in achieving their low\-carbon innovation ambitions **\[<ins>3.1</ins>\]**. In addition to the SMEs themselves, the beneficiaries of achieving this high\-level impact have been the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and Local Enterprise Partnership, the funders \(Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government\), and the collaborating HEIs in terms of new business collaborations. 

 The achievements of the Centre for Global Eco\-Innovation \(CGE\) for the Northwest region were externally audited by Amion in 2014 **\[<ins>5.1</ins>\]**. The findings of this independent audit illustrated the aggregate effects of the CGE, to which research cited above equipping SMEs with an understanding of what is needed to achieve low\-carbon growth and how to evaluate their success, was instrumental. At the time of the audit, the CGE had assisted 147 businesses \(p.40\). The CGE had created 166 gross jobs \- a net addition of 125 jobs \(p.46\). In relation to longer\-term project targets, Amion identified 236 net additional jobs and £35.1 M net additional GVA by 2018 \(p.ii\). The success of the CGE model for delivering business support was underlined by its value for money, audited at £20,922 per additional job compared with a regional benchmark of £37,600 per additional job. This gave a return on investment ratio of 5.5:1 by the end of 2017 compared with a regional ratio of 1.8:1 and a national average of 2.8:1 \(p.58\). The audit identified the environmental benefits of the CGE, saving 27,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> by 2017 and exceeding its 2022 target savings in water and material use by 2016, with reductions of 78,000 and 60,000 tonnes, respectively. 

 The success of the Centre for Global Eco\-Innovation as a HEI\-Business collaboration model for knowledge exchange and commercialization has been recognized across the HEI sector through the 2015 PraxisUnico RCUK award for ‘Outstanding KEC Initiative’ **\[<ins>5.3a</ins>\]**, and for developing new eco\-innovative products and services with ambitious small businesses through the 2015 Green Gown award for Research and Development **\[<ins>5.3b</ins>\]**. The CGE achievements are the foundation of a recently published BEIS Science and Innovation Audit on the capacity and capability of the North West Coastal Arc™ Partnership for Clean and Sustainable Growth **\[<ins>5.4**</ins>, p.20\-21 **\]**. 

 In recognition of our Centres’ successes in delivering low\-carbon growth in Liverpool City Region from European structural funding **\[3.1\]** both the Amion and Inner City Solutions evaluations conclude that the Centre for Global Eco\-Innovation was successful “ *increasing innovation activity and in strengthening the performance of beneficiary SMEs in the North West*” **\[<ins>5.1**</ins>, p.62 **\]** and that the Low Carbon Eco\-Innovatory “ *provided valuable support to businesses in Liverpool City Region that are seeking to inject low carbon practices to their operations*” \( **\[<ins>5.2**</ins>, p.56 **\]**. The Head of Low Carbon at Liverpool City Region’s Local Enterprise Partnership further affirms the role of the Low Carbon Eco\-Innovatory in stimulating *clean growth* in the city region **\[<ins>5.4**</ins>, p.10 **\]**, and the Principal Environment Officer, Liverpool City Region Combined Authority identifies that the “ *Low Carbon Eco\-Innovatory is fundamental to securing the creativity and innovation that we need to achieve our zero carbon goals*” and that “ *the partnership work championed by the Low Carbon Eco\-Innovatory represents the best of Liverpool City Region and shows that clean growth as a city region is well within our grasp*” **\[<ins>5.5</ins>\]**. The Low Carbon Eco\-Innovatory has been further recognised in the maritime sector by 2020 Mersey Maritime Industry Award for Environmental Impact for supporting more than 160 businesses in Liverpool City Region in achieving their low\-carbon ambitions **\[<ins>5.3c</ins>\]**. 

 The regional contact for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has further advised other Local Enterprise Partnerships on the Centre for Global Eco\-Innovation and Low Carbon Eco\-innovatory methodology as being an effective means for delivering low\-carbon growth, substantial business support, and for assessing the GHG reductions from the resulting products/services **\[<ins>5.6</ins>\]**. Research examining the resource life\-cycle of the businesses supported by our Centres has underpinned a new environmental assessment methodology that captures the success of European projects in terms of their resource savings **\[3.2\]**. 

 Novel academic insight **\[3.3**, evidenced through 31 citations and new research activity **\]** and enthusiasm around motivations and perspectives on green businesses has also been instrumental in fostering wider engagement in the Centre for Global Eco\-Innovation model across Local Enterprise Partnerships \(LEPs\) and HEIs in the NW and North Wales. This has led to a new pan\-LEP project \(EcoI\-NW, 2020\-2023\). 

##  <ins>2.</ins> <ins>New, Low\-Carbon Products and Services</ins> 

 The impact of research undertaken in the NW and Liverpool City Region is evidenced by bringing new products and services to market, increasing market share, business revenue, employment, and reduced costs. The Inner City Solutions audit of the Low Carbon Eco\-Innovatory **\[<ins>5.2</ins>\]** identified the main sectors supported as advanced manufacturing, visitor economy and the arts, maritime operations, digital and creative, and food production. In terms of satisfaction, “ *Survey results reveal very high levels of satisfaction among LCEI’s clients and the project team is well positioned to build on this momentum and play a key role in driving forward low carbon activity in the city\-region.*” \( **\[<ins>5.2**</ins>, p.3 **\]**. 

 In evidencing the impact of the research delivered through the Centre for Global Eco\-Innovation and Low Carbon Eco\-Innovatory in combination, it is challenging to normalize the experience across the range of SMEs involved, particularly as the needs of each business were highly specific and the nature of support provided was bespoke to those needs. Several examples of this research and development are presented in the Amion audit of the CGE **\[<ins>5.1</ins>\]**, the Inner City Solutions audit of the LCEI **\[<ins>5.2</ins>\]** and the BEIS Science and Innovation Audit **\[<ins>5.4</ins>\]**. With regard to the specific impact of research undertaken by University of Liverpool colleagues in UoA14, this is exemplified through the products and services developed with Marlan Maritime Technologies Ltd. and MM Sensors Ltd. The new, radar\-based coastal monitoring tool **\[<ins>3.4</ins>, <ins>3.5</ins>, <ins>3.6</ins>\]** has opened up new and diverse markets for Marlan, particularly as it is extremely cost effective when compared with previous survey solutions. The product is gaining traction in the areas of port navigation and coastal monitoring, particularly amongst the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales, local authorities with coastal defence responsibility, and coastal engineering companies. In support of Marlan’s Highly Commended recognition for Coastal Management at the EA’s Flood and Coast Excellence Awards in 2020, the Chair of the monitoring programme stated *“By continuously observing the immediate nearshore zone adjacent to the seawall over £2M efficiencies have been gained… This sustainable approach is readily transferable to other coastal authorities and provides visible evidence to the local community allowing them to understand and adapt to coastal change.”* **\[<ins>5.7</ins>\]** 

 Marlan have benefitted in terms of increased contracts \(including involvement in academic research projects in the UK and overseas\), turnover, Gross Value Added and staffing, but also in terms of expanding and differentiating their commercial offer **\[<ins>5.8</ins>\]**. Marlan Maritime Technologies and the National Oceanography Centre also received KTP funding from InnovateUK to further develop the survey capacity of the ‘ *RAPIDAR*’, thus enabling the original Centre for Global Eco\-Innovation graduate researcher to become Director of Research at Marlan \(along with an additional job created\). This KTP was awarded an ‘Outstanding’ grade in January 2019 **\[<ins>5.9</ins><ins>a</ins>\]**. 

 MM Sensors now offer the Synoptic\-4D data product package as defined for the Regional Coastal Monitoring Programme Framework issued by Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council in terms of providing data on intertidal topography subtidal bathymetry, surface current, wave spectra, tidal level and observed local meteorology. End\-user beneficiaries of the radar monitoring application so far have been local authorities with a responsibility for coastal management and protection \(Sefton and Wyre councils\), Peel Ports, the Environment Agency and Pevensey Coastal Defence Ltd., as well as coastal research and consultancy organizations **\[<ins>5.8</ins>\]**. This offer is now being rolled out to Argyle International Airport in St. Vincent & the Grenadines and to the Port of Beira in Mozambique, although delivery has been paused due to COVID\-19. 

 Marlan Maritime Technologies Ltd. have been recognized for their innovation and achievement within the NW region by receiving the Merseyside Innovation Award in 2017 **\[<ins>5.9</ins><ins>b</ins>\]**, across the maritime sector through the Mersey Maritime Award in 2018 **\[<ins>5.9</ins><ins>c</ins>\]**, and in receiving Highly Commended recognition in coastal management at the EA’s Flood and Coast events in both 2019 and 2020 **\[<ins>5.9</ins><ins>d&e</ins>\]**. Their Director of Research also received the Mersey Maritime Rising Star Award 2020 for his achievements in developing new coastal monitoring tools and methods **\[<ins>5.9</ins><ins>f</ins>\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Statistical methodologies developed at the University of Southampton and led by Professor Dankmar Böhning have refined a diagnostic biomarker test to detect growth hormone \(GH\) misuse. Improvements to the statistical methodology of the original test, particularly for age and gender adjustments, have sustained the confidence and application by the World Anti\-Doping Agency \(WADA\). The improved test is one of only two tests approved by WADA to measure GH misuse and is used in all major sporting events that fall under the governance of the International Athletics Association, from the Olympics to the World Athletics Championships. 

 The test has provided continued reassurance of fairness in sport by ensuring the statistical methodology meets the challenging WADA requirement of a 1 in 10,000 false\-positive rate. Since the test was introduced in 2015, no positive tests \(laboratory adverse analytical findings\) have occurred, despite it being applied on more than 30,000 occasions worldwide in 31 WADA\-accredited laboratories in 103 sporting disciplines. The refined GH test has made a significant contribution towards the goal of GH\-doping\-free sport.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 “Fairness” in competitive sports is a widely accepted paradigm. The International Fair Play Committee defines fairness in the context of the misuse of drugs: “Fair play means not cheating by taking drugs or doping. Anyone who does this ruins the game for everyone else.” Athletes competing with their naturally given resources is widely accepted, whereas the application of stimulating substances to gain advantages in competitions is considered as unfair. This research concentrates on growth hormone \(GH\), which can have advantageous effects in competition if it occurs in elevated levels. The scientific challenge is to separate naturally occurring GH from external injection \(doping\). 

 The current GH test, **GH\-2000**, was developed 1996\-1999 in a multinational project led by Professor Peter Sönksen at St Thomas' Hospital, London. Sönksen became a visiting Professor at Southampton’s Faculty of Medicine in 2002 and established a further project \(GH\-2004\) with Professor Richard Holt \(Medicine\) to validate the GH\-2000 test and achieve robustness against the effects of injury and ethnicity on test results. Subsequently, GH\-2000 was first used at the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games, increasing the window of GH detection after administration from around 12\-24 hours to several weeks. Two Russian powerlifters returned a positive test and were disqualified, having never been caught by the previous GH test. 

 The GH\-2000 score combines two assays of GH\-sensitive biomarkers as well as a correction term for age and is given by the generic formula: *GH\-2000 Score = b0 \+ b1 log IGF1 \+ b2 log PIIINP \+ b3/age*, where *b0*, *b1*, *b2*, *b3* are gender\-specific constants, and *IGF1* and *PIIINP* are insulin\-like growth factor\-I \(IGF\-I\) and the amino\-terminal pro\-peptide of type III collagen \(P\-III\-NP\). Each of these are measured by assays and currently, for each biomarker, three different assays are available. In consequence, a variety of GH scores exist for which decision limits need to be determined; these are set by WADA to maintain a **1 in 10,000 false positive rate** which, while seemingly high, is seen as a robust and appropriate level of reliability in situations where legal conflicts with athletes under suspicion of GH misuse arise. 

 For the GH\-2000 test used in the 2012 Games, and for the existing GH test, the decision limits had been developed using a relatively small dataset of 352 serum samples. A successful 2013 appeal to the Court of Arbitration in Sport against a positive result to the existing GH test indicated that the numbers of samples used to develop the test’s decision limits should be increased. In a project supported by Partnership for Clean Competition \(PCC\)  \[ **G1**\], Professor Dankmar Böhning of Southampton’s School of Mathematical Sciences joined Sönksen and Holt in 2013 to lead the statistical modelling and inference to develop decision limits for the GH\-2000 detection methodology based on a much larger dataset. 

 Serum samples were collected for anti\-doping purposes from 859 female athletes and 971 male athletes representing 200 countries and competing in 26 different track and field events at the 2011 World Athletics Championships in Daegu, South Korea.  For his new dataset, GH\-2000 scores were calculated separately for male and female athletes using combinations of 2 different assays for PIIINP and  3 different assays for IGF1; for all these 6 GH scores new decision limits were developed by Böhning and his group \[ **3.1**\], which were then adopted by WADA. 

 With the collection and establishment of an increasingly large database it became apparent that the original score showed a positive age effect in the male athlete population, which could potentially place older male athletes at a disadvantage. Böhning led the development of novel statistical methods to refine the tests that included a much\-needed adjustment for age \[ **3.2, 3.3**\]. 

 In addition, with Professor Wei Liu, Böhning developed exact decision limits in the following sense. Previously, decision limits were developed using an approximation by the normal distribution. In this work decision limits were developed using results from distribution theory which allowed use of the exact t\-distribution, thus avoiding the normal approximation. As a result the decision limits now meet precisely the 1 in 10,000 false\-positive rate required by WADA \[ **3.4**\]. 

 In 2017, with the support of WADA \[ **G2**\], these decision limits were further investigated on the basis of routinely collected growth hormone data from competing athletes by the world\-wide WADA accredited laboratories. The motivation behind this was to see if the decision limits could be confirmed if the biomarker test is applied routinely. Here, the motivation was to see if the decision limits remain stable if recalculated on a big data set. In addition, the intention was to make them more robust and less likely to be challenged legally because of increased numbers of athletes and broader diversity of sporting disciplines. In essence, the previously developed decision limits are currently being reconfirmed with ongoing scientific investigations with the expectation of them being implemented in 2021 \[ **3.5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 “Diagnosing growth hormone misuse is an important issue in competitive sports. For this we need reliable and valid decision limits which identify growth hormone dopers beyond reasonable doubt. These decision limits cannot be provided without solid statistical work. In recent years, Professor Böhning and his statistical colleagues in Southampton have provided strong and excellent contributions to the development of statistical methodology in the construction of the decision limits for growth hormone misuse… We are very happy to be able to cooperate with Professor Böhning and his colleagues.” – Scientific Director, **World Anti\-Doping Agency \(WADA\)** \[ **5.1**\] 

 The new decision limits based on Böhning’s analysis of the increased dataset were first incorporated into WADA guidelines in July 2015 \[ **5.2**\]. Since then, according to WADA’s 2019 annual report \[ **5.3**\], the refined GH\-2000 test has been used on 30,716 occasions. An annual breakdown is given in Figure 1, demonstrating strong growth in the years of the 2016 Summer and 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, with a peak of 8,755 tests in 2018. The test has been carried out in 31 WADA\-accredited Laboratories including Ankara \(Turkey\), Barcelona \(Spain\), Dresden \(Germany\), Ghent \(Belgium\), Lausanne \(Switzerland\), London \(UK\), Los Angeles \(USA\), Montreal \(Canada\), Oslo \(Norway\), Paris \(France\), Rio de Janeiro \(Brazil\), Rome \(Italy\), Seibersdorf \(Austria\), Stockholm \(Sweden\), Sydney \(Australia\), Salt Lake City \(USA\) and Warsaw \(Poland\). \[ **5.4**\] 



 **Figure 1**: Applications of the biomarker test by year 

 Figure 2 shows the growth in the number of sporting disciplines involved, reaching a peak of 103 in 2019. Clearly there is no limitation of which discipline can be involved other than whether it makes sense to do so \(it would make no sense to apply the test to snooker players, for example\).
 

 **Figure 2**: Number of sport disciplines involved in the application of the biomarker test 

 Since the new decision limits were introduced in 2015 there have been no positive test results. This is a clear indication of the influential effect of the test in preventing GH\-doping. Additionally, the statistical improvements to counteract the positive age effect in males was introduced in 2016, a year of strong growth in use of the test, demonstrating further the effectiveness of Böhning’s work. 

 These refinements have helped to sustain the high level of reliability of this test and its continued use in all world sports subject to the WADA code. Furthermore, the statistical methodology can be applied to other tests, not just GH\-2000. 

 **The Partnership for Clean Competition** in the USA can further attest to the crucial nature of the work at Southampton. This non\-profit organisation was founded in 2008 with a mission to fund scientific research globally which advances knowledge in the anti\-doping sphere and contributes meaningfully to the protection of clean athletes. Its Executive Director stated: “In recent years, Professor Böhning and his statistical colleagues based at the University of Southampton have provided further refinements to the development of statistical methodology in the construction of the decision limits for growth hormone misuse. There have been modifications that have improved the accuracy of this test in relation to gender differences and help to sustain the 1 in 10000 false positive rate required by WADA. Reliable, valid, and scientifically defendable male and female decision limits accurately identify growth hormone dopers to prevent false positives and false negatives in this test. The work of Professor Böhning and colleagues at Southampton have been of the utmost importance to identify the appropriate statistical methods in growth hormone misuse detection.” \[ **5.5**\] 

 The Head of Science and Medicine at **UK Anti\-Doping**, the government\-sponsored organisation responsible for protecting sport in the UK from doping, stated: “Professor Böhning’s contribution might not be as visible \(or possibly as recognised\) as the bioanalytical research that underpins the test, but the statistical refinements made in recent years have been just as critical to its continued use in a sector highly vulnerable to legal challenge and reputational damage.” \[ **5.6**\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Layla Skinns’ research on dignity in police custody for children and adults has had substantial impact on the law, police policy, practice, and the design of police custodial settings. 

 This ground\-breaking research into custody in England and Wales has resulted in legal and policy changes to the procedural and human rights of young suspects. It has contributed to an unprecedented reduction in the number of children being arrested. Legal changes now mean 17\-year\-olds in police custody are afforded the same rights as children including access to an appropriate adult and their parents/carers being informed of their arrest. 

 Her research into detainee dignity in custodial settings has changed police codes of practice and been adopted nationally via the National Strategy for Police Custody. Locally, forces have adopted her research and changed policy, practice, and risk assessment processes. The research has had a profound impact on attitudes and practice and led to Dr Skinns being considered the leading voice on police custody.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Skinns’ pioneering research explores the practices and experiences of staff and detainees in custodial settings. 

 Overnight custody and children 2011 

 In 2011 The Howard League for Penal Reform commissioned Skinns to conduct research into overnight detention in police cells of those under 18\-years. Legally children who are not granted bail \(by the police or courts\) should be transferred to accommodation managed by local authorities unless it is ‘impractical’ to do so, with secure accommodation also being provided in specific high\-risk circumstances. However, a lack of research made it impossible to ascertain if this was happening or if children were in fact being detained in police cells. Freedom of Information \(FOI\) requests and a literature review were used to identify the scale of the issue and its effects. Skinns identified that children were being held in custody overnight far more often than the law required or allowed.  Her research revealed for the first time that in one year there had been 53,000 overnight detentions \(19% of all detentions\) of children aged under 16 years in England and Wales suggesting that overnight police custody was routinely used in place of accommodation by local authorities **\[R1\]**. In addition, she found that there was limited access to appropriate adult services in the evenings/late at night thus increasing the risk of a detention becoming an overnight one **\[R1\]**. Skinns highlighted the serious anomaly that 17\-year\-olds, who are in general treated as minors elsewhere in the criminal justice system, were as a matter of law considered adults for police custody purposes. This meant they were not entitled to additional rights available to those who were 16 and under, including access to an appropriate adult and their parents being informed of their arrest.  Moreover, they could lawfully be detained overnight **\[R1\].** 

 ‘Good’ police custody 2013\-2018 

 The demands of police custody are such that staff must continuously balance competing priorities, including safety, security, risk, cost effectiveness, the law, and the requirements of the criminal justice process. Skinns led a five\-year ESRC national research study to robustly examine what ‘good’ practice meant in a custodial setting. Phase 1 of the study collected data on police custody delivery patterns from custody managers in nearly all England and Wales police forces. Phase 2 involved detailed observation of and interviews with detainees and staff in four forces in England and Wales. In phase 3, preliminary ideas about what ‘good’ custody means were tested through surveys of nearly 800 staff and detainees across 13 forces. 

 Skinns found that detainee dignity should be prioritised alongside existing priorities **\[R4\]**. Prioritising dignity is beneficial for staff and detainees as it increases detainee cooperation and creates a more humane experience **\[R5\]**. Skinns also explored the custodial environment and found that it mattered: a clean, bright, and spacious setting has the potential to lessen the pain of detention and encourage detainees to exercise their due process rights **\[R3, R6\].** In addition, recognising detainee dignity by including equipment in the space to support them, such as reading and writing materials and clocks, improves interactions with staff and can create more satisfying workplaces for staff \[ **R2\].** 

 Skinns developed a series of good practice recommendations launched in 2019 in relation to four interlinked areas: police attitudes and practices; policies, training, and line management; detainee expectation; material conditions and the custody estate.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Background 

 Sheffield research has driven the debate and provided reliable evidence to allow \(a\) the Howard League to campaign for the treatment of 17\-year\-olds as minors and better practice in relation to the use of police custody for all children \[R1\] and \(b\) the more dignified treatment of female detainees in custody. 

 The Police and Criminal Evidence Act \(PACE\) is accompanied by a series of Codes of Practice which set out how PACE should be put into practice. Code C applies to the detention, treatment and questioning of suspects. In April 2013, underpinned by the Howard League’s campaign, the Court of Appeal held that the failure of Code C to distinguish between 17\-year\-olds and adults was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. 

 Changed law and guidance on detention and treatment of children and adults in police custody 

 In October 2013, the Home Secretary amended Code C to make appropriate adults available to 17\-year\-olds. The research, and the campaigning based on it, went beyond these \(important\) amendments to Code C. In 2015, PACE itself was amended to include 17\-year\-olds in the definition of minors used in the Act. As a result, since October 2015, all arrested 17\-year\-olds have been treated as minors, not adults. Further amendments were made to Code C to reflect the new law in 2017. This has impacted on the experiences of the approximately 75,000 young people aged 17 who are arrested and detained in police custody each year. They now have access to an appropriate adult and their parents/carers should be informed of their arrest **\[S1\]**. 

 In 2017, the Home Office published its Concordat on Children in Custody, citing Skinns’ research. The Concordat set out in strong terms what is required by good practice, in relation to a custody sergeant requesting \(secure\) local authority accommodation **\[S2\]**. 

 Since 2014 there has been an unprecedented reduction in the number of children both arrested and detained in custody. The changes to the law, Code C, PACE and the introduction of the Concordat, all underpinned by the Howard League’s campaigning and based on Skinns’ work, have made a significant contribution to this reduction **\[S3\]**.  In 2019 there were 71,885 child arrests in England and Wales compared to 129, 273 at the end of 2013 \(a reduction of 44%\). 

 The research into dignity in detention **\[R2, R4\]** fed into additional substantive amendments to Code C relating to dignity of female detainees. In August 2019, the Government released amendments to Code C \(and H, the parallel code for the detention of terrorist suspects\). They require that female detainees be given an opportunity to speak to a woman about personal needs, for lavatory and washing facilities, and for staff to have a proper regard to the dignity, sensitivity, and vulnerability of detainees when clothing is removed and strip searching takes place **\[S5\]**. The amendments followed an open letter from the Independent Custody Visitors Association \(ICVA\): 

 *“Dr Skinns’ research has crystalised our messaging and placed us in an excellent position to challenge and ultimately change the law. It is now in law that female detainees in custody are asked if they require menstrual products and if they do these are provided. This impacts on the dignity and wellbeing of female detainees”* \(CEO, ICVA, **S5**\). 

 Transformed police force knowledge and practice 

 In January 2017, the current National Strategy for Police Custody was published. Under its first aspirational category – legitimacy – the National Strategy draws on the language of dignity and respect taken from Skinns’ research **\[R6, S4\]**. The strategy is a commitment to advancing the professionalism, efficiency, and efficacy of the custody provision. 

 In 2019 Skinns launched ten good practice recommendations based on her research into good practice in custody **\[R4\]**. They covered police practice, training and policies, detainee expectations, and the physical environment. These were shared at several events including the National Custody Forum in November 2019. The Forum is attended by representatives from all police forces and all other relevant police stakeholders, including the College of Policing, Independent Office for Police Conduct \(IOPC\), Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabularies, Fire and Rescue and Prisons \(HMICFRS, HMIP\), ICVA, and the Home Office. 

 By demonstrating what ‘good’ looks like and the steps required to make improvements, the research has impacted on the knowledge of local police forces. In 2020, Skinns conducted a pilot evaluation with Surrey police force. During booking in, staff utilised an information sheet, based on Skinns’ research, which provided detainees with information about dignified treatment, key rights and entitlements, welfare and vulnerability, and safety and security. The sheet was also distributed to the majority of detainees. Detainees made use of the information provided to request further assistance, in one case from an appropriate adult **\[S6\]**. 

 Further large police forces \- Essex, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, and the UK’s largest the Metropolitan Police Service \- have recognised the need for further work in to prioritising detainee dignity and staff development and as a result are committed to piloting the guidelines in 2021 \(this work would have happened earlier but was delayed due to COVID\-19\). 

 The recommendations have impacted on practice in several local police forces including Norfolk, Derbyshire and Devon and Cornwall. They have all implemented elements of Skinns’ recommendations. 

 *“We moved towards increased detainee dignity, and decency through the reduction in the use of rip proof clothing by enhancing observation regimes which itself led to reductions in assaults on staff, and a focus on inducing “good” behaviours, and a welfare\-oriented approach \(former Head of Custody”* **\[S7\]**. 

 Derbyshire’s policy had been to remove all belongings when someone entered custody, but it now risk assesses whether detainees can keep personal belongings. Devon and Cornwall have introduced Distraction Packs which include colouring books, puzzles, jigsaw, and foam footballs. These reduce anxiety and boredom and increase the likelihood the detainee will engage with the process **\[S5, S7\]**. 

 Impact on design of buildings and custodial settings 

 The research **\[R6\]** is having a critical impact on the physical design of police custody suites in England and Wales. In September 2019, the Ministry of Justice Estates Cluster published the revised version of the Police Custody Design Guide **\[S8\]**. Skinns was part of an expert reference group and ensured dignity was central to the guide. Senior Policy Advisor for the College of Policing and National Police Estate Group states: 

 *“Included in the 2019 practice guidance are important overarching principles. They include designing a suite that can “accommodate detainees safely, securely and enable them to be treated with respect and dignity. This is a shift from the previous design guide which had less emphasis on dignity and more on safety and security”* **\[S8\].** 

 Skinns drew on her research to author one section of the document, section 8.7 on “colour, art, painting and finishes”. In addition, Skinns fed into the National Police Estates Group \(NPEG, which provides peer review to police forces planning to build new custody suites or renovate old ones. The Custody Lead on the NPEG has consistently used Skinns’ research in undertaking the reviews **\[S8\]**, and in the design of two new custody facilities in his own home force area, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight. In Hampshire they have incorporated a glazed atrium, flooding the charge room with light. 

 *“The Good Police Custody Study themes \(dignity, decency, equality, legality, and autonomy\) have been considered in creating national blueprints for custody design”* **\[S8\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Between mid 2013 and the end of 2020, the IAPT programme has trebled in size. From seeing 434,000 people a year with depression and/or anxiety related problems in 2012/13, it now sees approximately 1,200,000 people per annum and is committed in the *NHS Long\-Term Plan* to increase this further. Outcome data is collected from an unprecedented 99% of treated patients. The England\-wide recovery rate for individuals who receive a course of psychological treatment has improved from 43% to 52% during the REF2021 impact period, meaning 230,000 more people recover each year.  New integrated IAPT services that bring together mental health and physical health care have been created and are achieving substantial savings in physical health care costs.  IAPT is being copied in other countries and provinces \(Norway, Ontario, Israel, Australia\). The work of David Clark’s research group at the University of Oxford has played a critical role in all of these developments. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 *How to collect outcome data on everyone who has a course of psychological therapy.*  The University of Oxford group were asked to train local clinicians in Northern Ireland in cognitive therapy for PTSD so they could treat traumatized survivors of the 1998 Omagh car bomb. As part of the initiative they created a simple session\-by\-session outcome monitoring system that ensured almost everyone who was treated between 1999 and 2001 had a pre and post treatment measure of the severity of their symptoms \[1\].  This was a radical improvement on the data completeness rates normally reported in NHS mental health services. The Oxford team’s session\-by\-session outcome monitoring system was subsequently adopted with great success in the IAPT programme. 

 *Understanding the determinants of variability in outcome between different IAPT services.*  The almost complete dataset generated by IAPT showed that there was considerable variability in the outcomes achieved by different services even though they are ostensibly delivering similar treatments with a workforce who are all trained according to consistent standards.  In an analysis in 2013 of the first wave of IAPT services \(n=32\), Clark and colleagues \[2\] showed that certain types of treatment and ways of delivering those treatments were associated with better patient outcomes. In a subsequent *Lancet* paper \[3\] Clark analysed publicly available aggregate data and showed that key organisational features of IAPT services \(n=200\) accounted for a substantial amount of the between service variability in outcomes during 2014/15.  Furthermore, change in these features between 2014/15 and 2015/16 was shown to explain over 40% of the improvement in outcomes during the same period of time. Dissemination of these findings helped IAPT services to substantially improve the outcomes they achieve with patients. 

 *The clinical and economic case for expanding IAPT and for creating integrated IAPT services.*  In their 2014 book \( *Thrive: The power of psychological therapies* \[4\]\), Layard and Clark drew on an extensive research literature to argue that : \(i\) expanding the IAPT programme would be clinically effective and would pay for itself in savings to the NHS and improvements in employment / presenteeism, and \(ii\) that creating new integrated IAPT services for people with anxiety/depression in the context of long\-term physical health problems \(diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease etc\) would result in substantial savings in managing the physical health problems. These arguments were accepted by the Treasury and NHS England. 

 *Developing the NICE recommended first line treatment for social anxiety disorder.*  Clark’s Oxford group developed a novel form of cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder \(CT\-SAD\) during the period 1998 to 2001 and ran the first randomized controlled trial \[5\] of the treatment in Oxford. The trial found that the treatment was superior to the leading medication. Subsequent independent RCTs in Germany, Japan, Norway, and Sweden showed that CT\-SAD is also superior to multiple other psychological therapies \(interpersonal therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, group CBT\) and twice confirmed its superiority to medication. These findings were included in a network meta\-analysis \[6\] that led NICE \(Clinical Guideline 159, May 2013\) to recommend the Oxford CT\-SAD as a first line treatment for social anxiety. Therapists in England and internationally are now being trained in this treatment.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The English Improving Access to Psychological Therapies \(IAPT\) has greatly increased public access to effectively delivered, NICE recommended psychological therapies for anxiety disorders and depression \[A\]. From small beginnings in 2008 \(when less than 80,000 patients were seen\) it now sees around 1,200,000 people per year \(NHS Digital, 2020\) \[B\] and the NHS Long\-Term Plan \(2019\) \[C\(iii\)\] commits to a further expansion with the programme seeing 1.9 million people per year by 2024. During the impact period the IAPT programme has tripled in size \(from 434,247 in 2012/13 to 1,165,653 in 2019/20\) \[B\]. The England\-wide clinical recovery rate for individuals who receive a course of psychological treatment has improved from 43% to 52% \[B\] on the same timescale and is now in line with expectation from randomised controlled trials.  Furthermore, nearly 7 in every 10 treated patients \(68%\) show reliable improvement \[B\]. New integrated IAPT services that bring together mental health and physical health care have been created and are achieving substantial savings in physical health care costs \[D\].  Clark has been the National Clinical and Informatics Advisor for IAPT since the programme started and is widely considered to be its principal architect. The work of his research group at the University of Oxford has underpinned substantial parts of the impact of IAPT, as outlined below. 

 **Collecting Outcome data on everyone who has a course of treatment \(two or more sessions before discharge\).** When Alan Johnson MP, announced the IAPT programme on 10<sup>th</sup> October 2007, he stated that, once it was established, 50% of treated patients will recover “as expected by NICE guidelines”. In order to assess whether this ambitious target was met, it was necessary to devise a system for collecting outcome data from everyone who was treated. The existing NHS outcome monitoring system, which involved giving patients a symptom questionnaire to compete at the first and last session of treatment, was not up to the job. A national audit of counselling services showed that this system only collected outcome data on 38% of treated patients \[A\]. To get around this problem, IAPT adopted the session\-by\-session monitoring system pioneered by Clark and Hackmann \[1\] in their Omagh community treatment project \[E\]. On advice from Clark, the programme also decided that the nationally reported outcome metrics for IAPT \(recovery rate and reliable improvement rate\) would remove any incentive for services to fail to collect data as they would assume that anyone without a post\-treatment \(last available session\) score would have failed to recover/improve.  Together, these two decisions have enabled IAPT to achieve an unprecedented pre\-post treatment data completeness rate of 99% for everyone who is seen at least twice \(NHS Digital\) \[B\]. This is better than in most randomized controlled trials and means that IAPT can accurately assess the outcomes that it achieves. 

 **Improving clinical outcomes.** The initial clinical outcomes achieved in IAPT \(recovery = 40%\) were well\-below target. Clark & colleagues’ patient level analysis \[2\] of outcomes during the first year of the programme showed that better outcomes were associated with giving the NICE recommended treatment, and with services that had higher average numbers of therapy sessions and higher step\-up rates. Their subsequent service level analysis \[3\] of data from 2014 confirmed the importance of an adequate number of sessions and higher step\-up rates. It also showed the services that had shorter waiting times, lower DNA rates, and consistently identified the problems they were treating using ICD\-10 codes, had better outcomes. Clark fed these findings back to services in an extensive series of regional and national workshops between 2013 and 2018 and they were incorporated into NHS England’s IAPT Manual \(2018\) \[C\(iv\)\], advance draft copies of which were available from late 2016. IAPT activity and outcomes have improved dramatically \(recovery from 43% to 52%\), during the REF2021 Impact period, meaning that 230,000 more people a year recover and 314,000 more a year improve than in 2013. Regional variation in outcomes has also halved. Longitudinal analyses show that improvements in services’ outcomes are strongly related to adoption of the quality standards identified in the Oxford analyses. Using the full national dataset, Clark et al \[3\] showed that the between\-year improvements they identified in the service organization features \(2014/15 to 2015/16\) predicted service\-level improvement in outcome. Subsequently, Clark reported that services continued to improve on these variables and that the degree of these improvements between 2015/16 and 2018/19 predicted over half the variance in service improvements in the proportion of people who have recovered by the end of treatment \(R<sup>2</sup>=.54\) \[F\(i\)\]. These findings were independently confirmed using data collected from London IAPT services between 2013 and 2019 \[F\(ii\)\]. 

 **Providing the combined clinical and economic arguments for further expansion and development of IAPT** *.* On 14<sup>th</sup> July 2014 the arguments outlined in Layard and Clark’s 2014 book entitled *Thrive: the power of psychological therapies* were presented at a major public event \[G\] in London, chaired by Andrew Marr and attended by senior politicians of all persuasions \(including Alan Johnson MP for Labour and Norman Lamb MP for the Coalition\). This event, and multiple private meetings with politicians and treasury officials, helped ensure that Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives all included a commitment to expand IAPT in their manifestos for the 2015 General election \[H\]. The government and the NHS subsequently confirmed major expansions of IAPT in the *NHS Five Year Forward View* \(February 2016, page 15\) \[C\(ii\)\] and the *NHS Long\-Term Plan* \(January 2019, page 68\) \[C\(iii\)\]. *Thrive* \(page 209\) also argued for the creation of integrated IAPT services that provide co\-located mental and physical healthcare for people with anxiety/depression and a long\-term physical health condition. In March 2015, NHS England asked David Clark and the President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists to co\-chair a working group to define the operational principles that would underpin integrated IAPT \[H\]. The working group’s recommendations were confirmed by the British Psychological Society, and the Royal Colleges of Psychiatry, General Practice and Physicians in a joint statement issued in November 2015 \[C\(i\)\]. Clark was then asked by NHS England to Chair the Education and Training Group that would develop curricula for training the psychological therapists who would work in the new integrated IAPT services and to also join the group that elaborated the clinical model, selected CCGs to receive early adopter funding, and set\-up national and local evaluations \[H\]. 37 CCGs were funded to develop integrated IAPT services in 2016\-2018. The official NHS England Blog \(10<sup>th</sup> July 2019\) \[C\(vi\)\] confirmed that these services were achieving excellent clinical outcomes while savings physical healthcare costs as predicted in *Thrive*. NHS England has confirmed that 75% of all CCGs in England are now developing integrated IAPT services. 

 **Take\-Up of NICE recommended treatment for social anxiety disorder.** The specialised cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder \(CT\-SAD\) that Clark and colleagues developed and initially tested in Oxford \[5\] had been recommended as the first line treatment for social anxiety disorder in the NICE Clinical Guideline \(CG159, May 2013\) that was published just before the start of the Impact period. This recommendation has since facilitated its widespread adoption. CT\-SAD is in the national training curriculum for IAPT CBT therapists \(latest edition January 2019 \[C\(v\)\]\), has been taught to over 4,800 English IAPT therapists and has been used to treat 64,000 patients during the Impact period. During COVID all the IAPT therapists moved to delivering treatment remotely \(by video link\). NHS England asked Clark and colleagues to provide detailed guidance on how to do this and the resulting webinar was viewed by 2,613 NHS therapists up to 22/07/20. The Canadian Province of Ontario has recently started its own IAPT programme \(called “Structured Psychotherapy”\) and has adopted CT\-SAD as the social anxiety treatment to be included in its therapist training programme \[I\]. To assist with such the training initiatives, the Oxford team created a free therapist resources website \[J\] that includes the therapist manual, specialized measures to guide treatment, and stream\-able videos of a full\-day clinical workshop by Clark plus 45 short videos illustrating key techniques. As well as being extensively used by IAPT training courses, the website had over 16,500 registered clinical users in 144 countries. Together they visited the site 268,459 times during 2020. 

 **International Impact of IAPT.**  The success of IAPT has attracted considerable international attention during the REF impact period. As the NHS’s Clinical and Informatics Advisor for IAPT and the author of *Thrive*, Clark has been invited to advise health commissioners and ministers in multiple countries \[I\]. Many of these countries have subsequently started IAPT\-like services and others are considering doing so. The most advanced is Norway, which now has over 50 IAPT services \(termed “Prompt Mental Health Care”\) that use the same outcome monitoring system to England and report similarly good outcomes \[I\(i\)\]. The Ontario \[I\(ii\),\(iii\)\], Israel \[I\(iv\)\] and Australia initiatives are also all adopting the outcome monitoring system and other IAPT features that derive from Clark’s research.  International press coverage includes a feature length article in the *New York Times* \(24<sup>th</sup> July, 2017\) \[K\] described it as “ *the world’s most ambitious effort to treat depression, anxiety and other common mental illnesses*”, and a December 2018 article that discussed IAPT in the Canadian *Globe and Mail* \[K\] was simply entitled,  “ *For better mental health care in Canada: look to Britain*”. An independent report in 2018 \[L\], commissioned by the Ontario \(Canada\) Department of Health, concluded that IAPT was the world’s most successful attempt to increase public access to evidence\-based psychological therapies for mental health problems. Finally, IAPT was selected for presentation as an outstanding example of UK innovation in mental health at the First Global Ministerial Mental Health Summit Government in London on 10<sup>th</sup> October 2018 and in the main plenary session of the World Government Summit in Dubai on 10<sup>th</sup> February 2019.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The history of the cultural exchange between the Welsh and the Khasi people of North East India is little known. In times of social and cultural division worldwide, awareness of how our cultural identities have been formed through transcultural relationships and how our histories have been defined by differing colonial/postcolonial contexts is crucial. Research by Professor Lisa Lewis at the Centre for Media and Culture in Small Nations \(CMCSN\) led to the Welsh and Khasi Cultural Dialogues project. This was shared via 28 public performances and 5 exhibitions by Indian and Welsh practitioners \(in India and Wales\) between 2017 \- 2020 and has **\(1\)** raised awareness of this history amongst communities in both countries, enabling participants from minority cultures to discuss their identities in relation to colonial/postcolonial history; **\(2\)** affected working practices of participant artists; **\(3\)** resulted in greater understanding of how artistic practice can reveal complex and hidden histories.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The cultural exchange between the Welsh and the Khasi peoples is an understudied area of research. The Khasi people, an indigenous ethnic group of North East India, are a designated Scheduled Tribe under the Constitution of India. The relationship is rooted in the history of the Welsh Presbyterian Mission to the Khasi\-Jaintia Hills \(now the state of Meghalaya\) in North East India between 1841 and 1969. Following India's independence in 1947, all foreign missionaries were required to leave the country over a period of time. Until the Welsh mission closed in 1969 its representatives undertook extensive cultural production based on exchange with the Khasi people, leaving behind a complex body of literature and performance \(letters, hymns and folksongs, writings, travel films and writing, photography, and poetry\). The intercultural processes that are a consequence of this interaction are not widely recognised and there has been a timely need to examine people’s experiences in relation to their memories of the mission and to analyse the implications of this history for contemporary postcolonial identities. This has been difficult, historically, because at the closing of the mission in the 1960s, both the Welsh and Khasi communities remained within themselves and there was no sustained diasporic relationship. 

 Professor Lisa Lewis of the CMCSN, University of South Wales, conducted research on the performance of history and memory for her 2018 monograph *Performing Wales* **\(3.1\)**, which proposes ideas for considering performance as a bind that ties people, memory and place. These ideas were investigated further in a transcultural context in ‘Welsh and Khasi Cultural Dialogues’ \(2015\-2019\), an interdisciplinary project in performance, film and music, funded by The Leverhulme Trust **\(3.2\)**. Lewis was principal investigator, with co\-investigator Dr Aparna Sharma \(World Arts and Cultures/Dance, UCLA\). Other research team members included project consultant Prof. Desmond Kharmawphlang \(Creative and Cultural Studies, North\-Eastern Hill University Shillong, India\); Senior Research Assistant Dr Helen Davies \(USW\); and Welsh musician Gareth Bonello who completed a PhD on the Khasi\-Welsh exchange in music in 2020. Collaborating artists in the core team included Welsh actor Rhys ap Trefor, Khasi actor Lapdiang Syiem and Khasi musician Benedict Hynñiewta. Other collaborating artists participated in performances in both countries. The project was conducted in two parts, involving a variety of methods used to investigate and respond to the history of the Welsh\-Khasi exchange: 

1.  Archive\-based research in India and Wales and ethnographic fieldwork in both countries that arrived at key research themes: 

-  **The ways in which transcultural contact complicates the understanding of colonial history and impacts on post\-colonial identities.** 

 Between October 2015 and October 2017, the team investigated the effects of Welsh and Khasi cultures on each other \(stemming from the presence of the Welsh Presbyterian mission in the Khasi Hills, 1841\-1969\) and what this has meant for the way that national identity is culturally performed. Research with local people in India and Wales revealed complex paradoxes of feeling related to the history of the Welsh mission in the Khasi Hills, which complicate simplistic definitions of colonial relationships **\(3.3\)**. 

-  **The ways in which the perceived 'peripheral' situation of both the Welsh and Khasi advanced their cultural exchange beyond that of a missionary agenda.** 

 The team explored the historic cultural exchange between peoples who belong to two historically\-defined ‘peripheral’ regions in relation to broader categories such as the British Empire and the Indian nation. The history of the development of distinct cultural/intercultural activities in both Wales and the Khasi Hills challenges the idea of the metropole as centre of cultural production in relation to which peripheries merely act in response with a derivative culture. Research revealed that this is a hidden history despite the fact that the cultural exchange took place for over 130 years. The complex consequences of intercultural exchange over time has meant that there are traces of the cultural exchange in contemporary social and cultural performances but they are not always easily identified. Revealing this is of crucial importance in understanding how the Welsh came to represent India in relation to themselves and how they affected Khasi Society. Additionally, the research allows us to comprehend how Khasi culture and society influenced Welsh culture and how the Khasi people came to view themselves in relation to the Welsh **\(3.4\)**. 

1.  The second half of the project \(November 2017–November 2019\), used Practice\-Research \(P\-R\) in performance, filmmaking, and music to respond to research themes: 

-  **The ways in which arts practice can be used to further an interdisciplinary understanding of the history of cultural exchange.** 

 A series of P\-R workshops with Khasi and Welsh performers, musicians and film\-makers \(21 day\-long workshops in India and Wales, 2017\-2019, with up to seven people\) provided spaces in which to explore multifacted understandings of history. Workshops explored a range of themes: ideas of homeplace in both cultures \(explored through a study of embodied responses to words representing homeland by Khasi and Welsh performers\); effects of colonial modernity on speech, e.g. the use of Welsh language orthography in the formation of the Khasi alphabet and literature and its influence on the oral tradition \(which performers explored through workshops on oral narratives and ways of telling\); embedded intercultural practices, e.g. difference/similarities in Khasi/Welsh choral singing \(which performers investigated through sharing Khasi/Welsh hymns and folk songs and which the musicians explored through unravelling intercultural tunes and composing new ones in collaborative jamming sessions\); colonial relationships \(explored through workshops on embodying the colonial photographic archive of the North East and representing the power relationships in photographic portraits\). These workshops provided the material for devising *Performing Journeys* **\(3.5\)**, an intermedial performance that toured India and Wales \(2019\-2020\) and through which the results of the P\-R in performance, music and film were positioned next to each other, providing a multi\-faceted response to the Welsh\-Khasi exchange. It is a performance that embodies the tensions, paradoxes and nuances in the Welsh\-Khasi cultural exchange as imagined and understood by Khasi and Welsh artists. This became the output touring communities in Meghalaya and Wales and the focus of a series of post\-show discussions with audiences. Other outputs included concerts and gigs in music and poetry, sharing new compositions, and screenings of documentary fieldwork by Aparna Sharma, listed on the project website **\(3.6\)**, which also provides information on the banner\-based exhibition on context, methodology and findings that accompanied the performance on tour in India and Wales in 2019\-2020 *.*

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 We estimate that over 4,500 people saw the work in India and Wales, in concerts and gigs, theatre performances and exhibitions \(based on combination of box office/front of house information from theatres and museums and headcounts and seats filled in community settings\). Audiences included Khasi and Welsh communities, audiences at national museums, theatres, independent music venues, festivals, universities and colleges in both India and Wales. Between 2017\-2020, eight concerts/gigs were held \(four in India; four in Wales\); twenty theatre performances \(nine in India; eleven in Wales\); and five versions of the exhibition which toured fifteen venues in total. Over 3 million people live in the Khasi\-Jaiñtia Hill state of Meghalaya in North East India, roughly the same population as Wales. Performances in India were concentrated in Meghalaya \(in the cities of Shillong and Jowai, and the Sohra locality, site of the first Welsh mission\), with a further three performances outside the Khasi\-Jaiñtia context, two in Kolkata \(Indian Museum and Kolkata International Book Festival\) and one in Delhi. Performances in Wales took place in Chapter Arts Centre Cardiff, the National Museum of History, and in Welsh chapels. Thousands of people heard/saw related broadcasts on BBC Radio Wales/S4C in Wales and Doordarshan TV/All India Radio and independent radio/cable channels in India **\(5.5\)**. 10 radio programmes were broadcast, 7 in India: on All India Radio \- 06/09/2017 \(no figures but coverage over all India, population 1.366 billion\), Big FM \- 7\-8/12/2018, 15/02/2020 and Red FM \- 25/07/2017, 26/04/2018, 26/04/2018, 22/04/2019  \(no figures, but coverage to population of 144,000\), and 3 in Wales on BBC Radio Cymru \- 04/03/2018, 13/10/2019, 13/09/2020, \(212,000 listeners, Rajar quarterly figures\). Programmes included interviews or entire programmes with team members. 7 television items were broadcast, 2 in India on Doordarshan TV North East on 16/07/2017 and North East Indian Cable Channel PCN on 16/07/2017 \(no figures but broadcast over the North East region \(population over 45 million\); and 5 in Wales on S4C \- 30/10/2017, 07/08/2018, 25/11/2018, 14/01/2019 and 20/01/2020 \(S4C audience figures 98,000\). Post\-show discussions in India and Wales, written feedback and reviews, reveal impact in three main areas: 

1.  **Increased awareness by participants \(artists and audiences\) of the history of the Welsh\-Khasi cultural exchange and an understanding of the importance of this history in the context of postcolonial identities today** 

 Participants referred to becoming aware of an untold part of colonial history – a ‘hidden’ part of Welsh/British history relatively unknown as Indian history. A Khasi audience member stated that it was *‘a step towards giving a voice and narrative for our people’ at ‘a critical time when we as a hill tribe are trying to gain more authority over how our lived experiences, our confrontations and engagements are articulated and expressed to the world’* **\(5.1.a\)**; for another Khasi audience member it was ‘ *fuel for introspection for…both communities to examine the history between the two’*, which is ‘ *of particular relevance in the current world where increasingly nationalistic perspectives are coming to dominate conversation about how people should relate to each other*.’ **\(5.1.b\)**. 

 Some audience members spoke of feelings of complicity. An audience member in Wales said: *‘I wasn’t aware of the history...I felt uncomfortable at times learning of this relationship and seeing how the Welsh have used religion for colonial purposes. But I also got that the relationship was a ‘dialogue’’* **\(5.2.a\)**; and another spoke of awareness ‘ *not only the history and its traces today...but also about myself and my prejudices*’ **\(5.2.b\)**. For one participant in Wales, ‘ *The work led me to reflect deeply on my understanding of Welsh identity, the complex relationship between Wales and the British Empire…leading to discussions on minority identity and the relationship between Khasi, Indian, Welsh and British identities*’ **\(5.3.a\)**. A participant in India spoke of the work being ‘ *essential in understanding the dismantling of hierarchies of how and who explains a history linked to a colonial past’ and of it leading to questions about responsibility for ‘artists and researchers in unearthing and re\-presenting/representing that linked history*’ and questions regarding how these stories can be told without bias: ‘ *Can one avoid the retelling without bias?*’ **\(5.3.b\)**. 

 The impact of this work is also recognised by cultural representatives in both Wales and India; the Chair of the Indian National Trust for Arts and Cultural Heritage \(Meghalaya\) said that the work instigated ‘ *a renewed discussion and understanding of this history and an awareness of the importance of voicing histories which have not been adequately explored*’ **\(5.7\).** The Deputy Head of Public History and Archaeology at the National Museum Wales confirmed that it raised ‘ *awareness…and enable\[ed\] an understanding for people in Wales of this complicated history from the point of view of minority cultures*’ **\(5.8\)**. A representative of the Presbyterian Church of Wales said that the performance and exhibition encouraged a ‘ *type of communal remembering that is important for defining the identity of the chapel and its members’* and that it encouraged *‘understanding by raising awareness of the history in all its complexity*.’ **\(5.6\)**. 

1.  **Impact on working practices for participating artists and cultural facilitators** 

 Eighteen artist\-participants were involved in the project, specializing in performance, music, film, and performance design. Participants from Wales spoke of the impact of the collaborative research on their own practice: ‘ *Working in this way has had a profound effect on the way that I collaborate today, especially with artists whose culture differs from my own…building a working culture in which participating artists feel comfortable expressing themselves and have the power to shape the collaboration*’ **\(5.3.a\)**; and of transcultural working practices enabling participants to ‘ *think much deeper about representation in performance…\[and\] question who the intended audience are, who will benefit the most from experiencing the work, and how can we reach them. It has also made me question my identity as a white male performer, who do I represent?*’ **\(5.3.c\)**. A reviewer from Jowai \(capital of the Jaiñtia Hills, a region renowned for its community drama festival tradition\) referred to the impact of the medium used on local theatre practices, ‘ *The play was appreciated by the people of Jowai...known for their tradition of organising dramas...The multilayered story telling method has definitely inspired and given more ideas to the traditional dramatists of the town.*’ **\(5.4.e\)**. A cultural facilitator from India commented, ‘ *One of the best examples I have seen as a person who works to facilitate intercultural dialogue between India and other, mostly western, countries…I now use the example of this project in sessions that I conduct on ‘good practice’ in ‘collaborative projects.’*’ **\(5.1.c\)**; Head of International Relations at Welsh Government said: ‘ *This is important work, and a model of international artistic collaboration that reflects on past cultural exchange while focusing on contemporary and future relationships*’ **\(5.9**\). 

1.  **Greater understanding of the effectiveness of artistic practice in revealing complex/hidden histories** 

 Feedback revealed a realisation that artistic practice is a valuable form of interpreting history: ‘ *My first thought when I watched the work, was to think about history and the ways in which it is told…the very many perspectives that the telling of history misses out on…The experience of this performance and the mediums it used \- language, space, sound and visual, felt more whole, more honest, in the ways in which this history between two very different cultures…was examined and told…from multiple perspectives*’ \( **5.1.c**, Delhi\). During post\-show discussions, numerous audience members spoke of performance as a medium that makes complex histories accesible. This was reiterated in written responses:  ‘ *The reinterpretation of history through performance…presents this linked history in a physical and visual representation of the politics of race, gender, memory and language. It is presented…in a more palpable form that connects emotionally as well as intellectually*’ \( **5.3.b**, Khasi participant\); and mentioned in a review in the *Times of India* by Ananda Lal \(27/02/2020\): ‘ *Unconventional performance allows artists to explore subjects in ways that mainstream theatre often cannot. The British Council’s support of intercultural collaboration exposes local performers and viewers to new approaches*’ **\(5.4.f**\). This view was shared by those working within historical institutions, such as National Museum Wales: ‘ *These moments of transcultural practice are clearly instigating a discussion on new models for how we might approach history through performance’* \( **5.8**\).

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Vikings are a popular topic for computer games, TV and online. However, one corollary is that inaccurate views of vikings have been increasingly manipulated by the far\-right to promote xenophobia and sexism. To combat these stereotypes Downham has worked with television and radio companies and contributed to a new version of the multimillion player game *Assassin’s Creed*, to narrate diversity in Viking Age societies for international consumption. Media companies have benefited from Downham’s input to develop research\-led narratives, including productions with a self\-proclaimed aim of challenging stereotypes. This in turn increases the reach and significance of more nuanced portrayals of vikings to combat the spread of dangerous misinformation. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Downham's research on vikings has challenged assumptions about the identities of different viking groups and their interactions with other peoples. This work developed from a perspective of the Irish Sea region as a melting pot of different cultures in the Viking Age in contrast with popular discourse which present an ethnically segregated view of the medieval past \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3\). Taken to extremes, views of vikings as a biologically\-defined group continually waging war against other cultures have been perpetuated by hate groups. In addition, far\-right views of the Viking Age are male\-dominated with women seen as ‘stay\-at\-home’, submissive or enslaved. Downham’s research has highlighted cross\-cultural interaction, co\-existence as well as warfare and the role of women as political players in Viking Age politics. 

 The first phase of viking activity has often been interpreted as Scandinavian ‘hit\-and\-run’ raids with vikings returning home quickly with minimal interaction with non\-Scandinavian peoples. Women are excluded from this narrative, except as the victims of rape and pillage. Downham argues that early viking travels were more complex, with vikings traveling between multiple destinations and staying outside Scandinavia for prolonged periods. The standard model of hit\-and\-run raids was re\-evaluated to demonstrate that vikings established short term camps in Britain and Ireland in the 790s\-820s, and to highlight the evidence for negotiation as well as violence in this early phase, by analysing records of political alliances from the late 830s \(3.4, 3.5\). 

 In the ‘land\-taking’ phase of viking activity in Britain and Ireland \(c. 840\-880\), it is often assumed that there was segregation between ‘Danish’ and ‘Norwegian’ groups in their new home, as well as between Scandinavians and non\-Scandinavians. This ethnically divided view of the Viking Age is problematised by Downham’s re\-evaluation of the labels used to describe vikings in contemporary sources \(3.1, 3.2\), and her application of theories of migration to evidence for cross\-cultural contact \(3.3\). The interactions between peoples led to the emergence of new local identities and cultures from a fusion of Scandinavian and non\-Scandinavian elements. Downham's research demonstrates that cultural hybridization occurred at an earlier stage than is often recognized. Intermarriage was key to these developments, but we also see women in this period playing major political roles \(3.6\). Integration was a deliberate strategy in Viking Age communities to serve practical ends and help embed new hierarchies of political power \(3.3\). Downham argues that vikings were less pre\-occupied with policing ethnic, national and gender boundaries than people today tend to assume. By promoting a more accurate view of the Viking Age, dangerous stereotypes are eroded, and the public are engaged in a more intriguing vision of the past.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Immediate beneficiaries of Downham’s research include game developers and documentary makers, who seek to develop fresh, research\-led narratives for their audiences. Downham’s input deliberately challenges long\-held stereotypes of vikings promoted by the far right \(e.g. Nordic Resistance Movement, Soldiers of Odin\) which see vikings as haters of peace, living in societies where peoples of different ethnicities did not mix, where only men played important roles. 

 Creating an Inspirational Database for *Assassin’s Creed* 

 Downham’s research and expertise was sought by Ubisoft for their latest game, *Assassin’s Creed*: *Valhalla*, released in November 2020. The *Assassin's Creed* franchise has massive international reach. Ubisoft holds a significant place in the global gaming market, which was valued at USD151.55 billion in 2019. Previous instalments of *Assassin’s Creed* have sold over 140,000,000 copies, yet *Valhalla* exceeded the initial sales records of all previous versions of the game, with over 3,500,000 copies sold in its launch week. It achieved UK Number 1 and US Number 2 sales chart positions in December 2020. 

 In June 2018, early in the development process, Ubisoft commissioned Downham to write 50 illustrated articles \(over 100 pages\) on topics of her choice relating to late 9th century England. While much of the game is based in fantasy, the developers sought to create an immersive historical experience. Ubisoft stated that the set of 50 illustrated articles that Downham provided formed an ""inspirational database"" which was used ""to provide scholar\-based elements of historical content and inspiration to our production teams. Dr Clare Downham’s work has contributed to achieve both objectives.” \(5.1\). 

 Elements of the game reflect Downham’s input, complementing Ubisoft’s interest in challenging negative stereotypes. Ubisoft pointed out in December 2020 that “Video games have the power to promote the values of diversity and inclusion” \(5.1\). Downham’s database articles included the topics of *Women* and *Masculinity*. These challenge the view that only heterosexual male vikings had agency. Subsequently the main protagonist in *Valhalla* can be played as a man or a woman, and the character can have a same\-sex sexual encounter. Downham's database articles also criticised simplistic portrayals of vikings as violent xenophobes, with articles on *Ethnicity, Towns, Trade, Crafts*, etc. Consequently, in the game the protagonist must establish a village and develop cross\-cultural alliances as well as fight. As noted on Ubisoft's launch website: “Violence won’t be the only tactic for getting what you want.” 

 The historian and inspirational content designer based at Ubisoft’s headquarters in Paris wrote that Downham’s input “constitutes a unique resource” for the game’s development and praised Downham’s “broader focus on characters… which gives more diversity and complexity”. In June 2020, Downham was invited to give an online lecture to the entire *Valhalla* development team in France and Canada. It was followed by a Q&A session providing research\-based answers to specific developer needs. Participant comments included “Best History Class Ever” \(5.1\). Overall Downham’s input from 2018 to 2020 has influenced *Valhalla*’s challenge to stereotypes of vikings, creating a richer and more diverse view of the past. 

 *Valhalla*’s impact is reflected in online reviews praising its historical content \(5.2\). According to *PC Gamer* the game can “prod the rigidity of Norse culture and traditions with surprising nuance” and *Valhalla* is better than earlier *Assassin’s Creed* games at “telling an engaging story” of the past. *NME* praises the game for “transforming historical tales … for the first time in years AC feels essential again”. *GRYonline* reports “AC Valhalla allows us to immerse ourselves in the world of Nordic vikings on an unprecedented scale” and “shows this peaceful side of the vikings”. The level of gender equality in the game has also received positive commentary. *Eurogamer* notes “female Eivor is the canon experience for all your Norway and England adventures”. Downham's research has contributed to the historically informed content and helped to create storylines within the game that have garnered widespread acclaim. 

 Shaping TV and radio documentaries 

 Downham has worked with documentary makers and other media producers as user\-beneficiaries to explicitly inform the way they represent cross\-cultural and gender relations in the Viking Age.  As consultant on the BBC’s *King Alfred and the Anglo\-Saxons: Aethelflaed* \(5.3\) Downham appeared in the programme discussing female leadership in the Viking Age \(3.6\).  The programme has been broadcast 12 times since 2014, most recently on 25 February 2020 \(507,973 viewers\). The head of the production company Michael Wood reported: “it has been the single most influential series on TV about the Anglo\-Saxon/Viking era.""  He stated that Downham’s interview ""gave a different take on the whole story, getting the audience to think about a story which at that point had never been told in the popular media”.  As a spin\-off, in 2018 Downham was interviewed for and fact\-checked the top\-listed BBC news item *Aethelflaed: the warrior queen who broke the glass ceiling* \(5.4\). 

  

 Downham was consultant and co\-presenter for 1 of 4 episodes of *The Real Vikings* for History Canada, made to accompany the hugely successful *Vikings* drama series.  The series, which challenged the notion that vikings were a single nation \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6\), reached 1,800,000 viewers in the USA and 1,100,000 in the UK when it aired in 2016. It was re\-aired on the History Channel in 2018.  In the director’s view, Downham’s role “was crucial… Without Clare's participation, we would not have been able to tell the story” \(5.5\). An article citing Downham’s interview, *Who was Viking Warrior Ivar the Boneless?* was published by howstuffworks.com on 23 September 2020. 

 Downham was consultant and interviewee for PBS / Channel 4’s *Lost Viking Army* \(USA\) / *Britain’s Viking Graveyard* \(UK\) \(5.6\). The director wrote, ""Your expert contribution… imparts key information at a critical point in the film"".  Downham led the narration of the movements of viking leaders between Britain and Ireland. Released for an international audience in 2019, the documentary has since been released as an educational DVD, pitched at an adult audience. 

 Downham’s research on cross\-cultural contacts informed TG4 Ireland's documentary on a Viking Age battle, *Cluain Tarbh*, first broadcast in 2014 and rebroadcast numerous times \(5.7\). The producer stated by email: ""I consulted a number of your publications … which helped inform the shooting scripts and the shape of the series"". Downham’s interview critiqued representations of the battle as an ethnic conflict between bad pagan vikings and good Christian Irish, showing that vikings and Irish fought on both sides. It helped attract “above average viewing figures, and considerable critical acclaim”. A review in *History Ireland* magazine \(April 2014\) noted “substance is provided by an engaging range of experts: Clare Downham … amongst others"". A spin\-off was Downham’s involvement in the 2014 Clontarf millennium celebrations in Ireland. The chief researcher for Trinity College Dublin's *Emperor of the Irish* exhibition in 2014, which “was seen by approximately a quarter\-of\-a\-million people”, states:  “Dr Downham's published work was an important influence on my design, particularly with regard to setting the story of the exhibition within its international cultural context” \(5.7\). 

 Downham’s research has helped radio producers, most recently underpinning episode one of the BBC Radio 4 \(and World Service\) series, “How the Irish Shaped Britain”. Her interview in 2020 focused on viking interactions across the Irish Sea, and started the series at West Kirby, a site of Hiberno\-Scandinavian settlement in the Wirral. The producer wrote: “Your knowledge and research have been … extremely important … Quite apart from the learned input you have had in our programme, it was also fascinating to … dispel some myths about the period \(and about the Vikings\)” \(5.8\). The interview referenced the intermingling of different ethnic groups in the Viking Age \(3.3\). 

 Downham’s impact on producers, directors and writers has been to shape narratives and help attract large audiences using fresh storylines that offer a striking departure from well\-established but simplistic tropes of the Viking Age. 

 Challenging far\-right portrayals of vikings 

 Downham’s research on viking identities and trans\-national contacts has influenced public debate, especially her article *Vikings were never the pure\-bred master race white supremacists like to portray* in *The Conversation* \(29 September 2017, 240,000 reads, 65,800 shares on Facebook\). It was based on her earlier research \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3\). The article was reprinted through various news outlets \(e.g. *Metro Online*, *Yahoo News*, *Newsweek*\) and republished in Dutch \(InnerSelf\) and Danish \(videnskab.dk\). It was critiqued in the White Supremacist publication *American Renaissance* indicating that her research is perceived as a threat to alt\-right representations. Both positive and angry personal messages were sent from members of the public via Facebook and academia.edu, showing the article had importance to readers, e.g. “thank you for your well written article… keep up the good work” \(Facebook messenger 17 November 2017\). Downham’s work was subsequently cited in publications challenging extreme right\-wing views. A link to the Conversation article is given in *Time* magazine's *White Supremacists Have Weaponized an Imaginary Viking Past. It's Time to Reclaim the Real History* \(12 April 2019\) to support the statement “they were not homogenous seafarers as is often imagined”. Other citations of Downham’s article include the article *White Supremacists are misappropriating Norse mythology* on the University of Alberta’s journalism site *Folio* \(5.9\). 

 Downham’s work was used in the making of the Al\-Jazeera documentary *Vikings vs Neo\-Nazis: Battling the Far Right in Sweden* \(broadcast in March 2020, and since gaining 37,000 YouTube views\). The director writes: ""Your article and the other academics work really gave some solid grounding for the film and the director’s statement"". Downham’s *Conversation* article is quoted and linked in the online *Filmmaker’s View* alongside the statement “Clare … argues that rather than the marauding smash\-and\-grab thugs portrayed in popular culture, Vikings sustained long\-term peaceful interactions with foreign peoples, based on trade” \(5.10\). 

  

 Downham’s research has influenced gaming and media companies especially in Western Europe and North America. Her work has enabled producers to develop multi\-faceted research\-based interpretation of the past to challenge simplistic understandings of the vikings. Her work has shaped presentations of cross\-cultural contacts and women in the Viking Age. Downham’s publications have also been used by writers and documentary makers specifically to develop a counter\-narrative to dangerous and inaccurate stereotypes which have been peddled by far\-right groups on an international stage.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Climate change and urbanisation are increasing flood risks for homes and businesses. Householders and business owners can reduce risks by using property\-level flood resilience \(PFR\) – but few do so. By demonstrating the reasons for low uptake of PFR among householders and businesses, Dr Harries’ research has impacted public policy and industry. His research has \(1\) prompted Defra and the Environment Agency \(EA\) to abandon ineffective PFR strategies and launch a PFR collaboration with industry, as well as to help 60,000 people implement PFR. It has also \(2\) informed flood risk management innovation in Belgium; \(3\) persuaded parts of the UK insurance industry to provide free PFR instead of relying on homeowners to fund their own; and \(4\) improved a national PFR website. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In England and Wales, floods cause £1.4 billion of damage annually. 860,000 homes and 20% of non\-domestic properties have a high probability of being flooded. Retrofitted property level resilience measures \(PFR – e.g. resilient kitchens, resilient airbricks and door barriers\) significantly reduce the impacts of flooding. 

 Previous work on the take\-up of PFR focussed on the perception of risk and the material costs and benefits of PFR. Harries’ research was the first to reveal social and psychological explanations for the low take\-up of PFR **\[R1\]**. It demonstrated that protective behaviour may be more influenced by emotional than financial considerations. 

 From 2008 to 2011, Harries co\-designed and analysed a survey of 600 respondents living in high flood risk areas in England. Harries’ research revealed that people had to perceive PFR as normal and consistent with their social identity before they would commit time and money to it. 

 Previously, the UK government and insurance industry had tried to encourage the take\-up of PFR simply by providing information about risk and PFR options. Harries showed the need to rethink this approach. His work demonstrated that householders were afraid that PFR would be seen by neighbours as a betrayal; they feared that by adopting it they would be suggesting the local area was unsafe. Householders also anticipated the potential shame of others deeming PFR a waste of money or a sign of paranoia. Finally, some feared that PFR measures would actually make them feel less safe; it would oblige them to accept the risk without using denial to manage their anxiety. 

 Harries and colleagues also found that it was important to normalise PFR within the in\-groups of small businesses **\[R2\]**. From 2012, the team were part of the ESPRC\-funded SESAME project \(Organisational Operational Response and Strategic Decision Making for Long Term Flood Preparedness in Urban Areas\) **\[R3, R4\]**. Harries and colleagues designed, carried out, and analysed a series of 36 semi\-structured, narrative style interviews from four case study areas. These interviews captured the behaviour and actions of small businesses in relation to experienced or hypothetical flooding. 

 Using a sensemaking approach to explore the businesses’ responses, they found that SMEs distrust advice that contravenes in\-group norms. Instead, messages need to use the voice, framing and language of small businesses themselves or of other trusted insiders. Additionally, these messages only landed if existing businesses’ identities and assumptions were unaffected or if shock made them untenable. 

 Their research, both in journal articles **\[R1, R2\]** and framed as factsheets **\[R3, R4\]**, provides a key resource for stakeholders trying to increase uptake of PFR, making evident the need for normalisation.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 *1. Impact on Defra, the Environment Agency, businesses, and communities affected by flooding* 

 Since the publication of R1 in 2012, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(Defra\) and the Environment Agency \(EA\) have ended their reliance on information campaigns. They have instead launched pilot schemes to find ways of normalising PFR and involving the commercial sector. The impact of Harries’ research on such policy decisions is evidenced in its citation in numerous public policy documents. These include the Property Flood Resilience Roundtable’s <ins>Action Plan</ins> **\[S1\]** and reports by the Adaptation Sub\-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change **\[S2\]**, Defra **\[S3**\], the Social Market Foundation **\[S4\]** and an EA review of relevant behavioural insights **\[S5\]**. 

 A Defra Policy Advisor stated that Harries’ research made ‘ *a substantial contribution to \[Defra and the EA’s\] work to increase take\-up of PFR*’. He explained that Harries’ work, with specific reference to **\[R2\]**, challenged policymakers’ assumption that the best way to encourage PFR was to provide a ‘ *logical presentation of the benefits’ and instead ‘highlighted the strong role that emotion plays*’. This brought a ‘ *change of direction*’ in policy and practice which has ‘ *contributed to reducing the cost, disruption and distress cause by flooding*’ **\[S6\]**. 

 Defra/EA launched two pilot schemes because of Harries’ research. In 2013, they set up a GBP5 million scheme in order to normalise PFR. This scheme,  [<ins>Flood Resilience Community Pathfinder</ins>](http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/34863/), funded locally\-led projects that drew on local knowledge and wisdom and helped 60,000 property\-owners improve their resilience to flooding. In 2019 a similar pilot scheme was launched \- the GBP 3 million 2019\-2021 <ins>Boosting Action to Make Homes and Buildings More Resilient to Floods</ins> *.* The report, written by WPI Economics, that underpins this scheme cites Harries’ research 27 times. The WPI Economics Director described how Harries’ work ‘ *deepened our understanding of the broad range of \(often counterintuitive\) psychosocial influences on the take\-up of resilience measures*’ **\[S7\]**. These two pilots will reduce local authority costs, emergency responder costs and flood damage. 

 In addition, Harries’ research profoundly affected how Defra and the EA work with the commercial sector **\[S7, S8\]**. The Policy, Strategy and Investment Research Theme Lead at the EA explained that she regularly sends the SESAME factsheets to colleagues and flood management authorities and that ‘ *the SESAME research has also played a key role in shaping a training course for EA staff*’. She went on to say ‘ *were it not for the SESAME research…I would not have been able to provide EA staff with accessible insights into SMEs*’. It remains ‘ *the main source of evidence*’ on SME flood resilience for the EA, which regularly sends it in response to enquiries from English local authorities, Welsh Government and Natural Resources Wales. In addition, the research ‘ *helped put SMEs on the government’s flood risk management agenda*’. Without it, Defra and the EA ‘ *would have been less able to engage SMEs in flood resilience*’ and ‘ *the nation’s SMEs would likely be more vulnerable to flooding*’ **\[S8\]**. 

 Harries’ research was also a key factor behind a strategic innovation benefitting both households and SMEs: the 2016 establishment of the PFR Roundtable. His findings on businesses’ sense of independence and reliance on in\-group opinion persuaded Defra to ‘ *get the business community to find its own solutions*’ by asking it to establish and lead a roundtable of commercial stakeholders comprising the insurance industry, banks, engineering companies and others. This roundtable ‘ *made significant progress towards the normalisation of PFR*’ by raising the profile of PFR and facilitating dialogue between business sectors. It has also made substantive progress – for example, by developing a code of practice for the resilient reinstatement of flooded buildings \[ **S7\]**. As summarised by Sedgwick’s National Technical Director, chair of one the round\-table’s task groups, Harries’ findings convinced the PFR Roundtable to ‘ *avoid simplistic solutions that would \[…\] have been ineffective*’ and to ‘ *design \[subsequent\] campaigns to minimise the issues raised*’ by his research **\[S9\]**. 

 *2. Impact on flood risk management innovation in the Flanders Environment Agency* 

 When Defra shared the lessons of Harries’ research with colleagues in Belgium there was ‘ *a tangible impact on government policy*’. The Flanders Environment Agency stopped using information campaigns to change behaviours and instead adopted a bottom\-up approach. The Agency engaged citizens in the towns of Ninove and Geraardsbergen via citizen consultation and citizen involvement in planning **\[S6\]**. 

 *3. Impact on the Insurance Industry* 

 Harries’ message on the importance of normalisation also had an important impact on the insurance industry. It also dissuaded one of the UK’s two largest loss adjusters from attempting to convince homeowners to self\-fund PFR and to instead ‘ *persuade insurance companies to normalise PFR by paying for it as part of post\-flood insurance\-driven property reinstatement*’. As a result of this change of strategy, one ‘ *large insurer*’ now funds PFR for its customers **\[S9\]**. 

 *4. Improving a national PFR website* 

 Harries’ research improved the Roundtable’s web\-tool that provides a one\-stop\-shop for PFR across Britain. The Task Group Chair commented that Harries’ work ‘ *provided much of the evidence base*’ for the tool’s development, ‘ *challenged our assumptions about \[users’\] needs, preferences and decision\-making processes*’, enabled the Roundtable to ‘ *optimise the tool to address the needs of \[users\]*’, and consequently ‘ *the web tool has significantly improved in both structure and content*’ **\[S10\]**. The website receives over 1,000 hits a month. Due to these improvements, more householders and SMEs access information about PFR and investigate ways of reducing their vulnerability to flooding.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The uncontrolled spread of non\-native invasive species costs the UK environment and economy an estimated £1.8 billion per year. Sheffield research has provided critical theory underpinning the assessment of risks associated with invasive plants in the UK through the Non\-Native Risk Analysis Panel \(NNRAP\) which contributed to the decision to ban the sale of seven plant species in England and Wales. The work of NNRAP shapes eradication programmes and the work of community groups key to the monitoring and management of the UK countryside. The research has had significant impact on EU policy and practice as NNRAP protocols have provided the foundation for EU risk assessments on invasives.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Assessment of the threat of invasive species, and measures of the efficacy of control, requires the use of mathematical models to predict the growth and spread of those species. However, conventional models based on size structure create problems by dividing a population into a set of arbitrary classes or “stages” whereas in reality population size is a continuous variable. To overcome this problem, Rees and colleagues have developed “integral projection models” \(IPMs\). These models can be applied to any population, determining the rate of population growth or spatial spread. These have been particularly useful in the study of invasive species and in the assessment of effectiveness of different management strategies to control their spread. 

 Underpinning theory for modelling invasive species 

 Work by Rees and Ellner showed how **integral projection models \(IPMs\) can avoid some of the limitations of matrix models when looking at species where individual demography is affected by multiple attributes that vary over the life cycle**. They developed IPMs to take into account complex demographic attributes such as dormant and active life stages, changes between discrete and continuous structure over the life cycle, and cross\-classification by several attributes including size, age, and condition **\[R1\]**. Rees and Ellner also developed methods for creating and analysing IPMs that encompass interannual variability in survival, growth rate, and fecundity. By exploiting the close correspondence between stochastic IPMs and statistical analysis of trait\-fate relationships in a ‘hierarchical’ or ‘mixed’ models framework, Rees and Ellner demonstrated that IPMs can be parameterized in a straightforward way from data using conventional statistical methods and software **\[R2\]**. 

 Application of theory to provide knowledge on invasive species population dynamics 

 It was very apparent that such models are readily applicable to situations involving invasive plant species. For example, Rees and colleagues used the IPM approach to explore how habitat disturbance and propagule pressure \(a measure of number of invasive species\) determined the success of invasion, using two highly invasive species as exemplars \( *Lantana* and *Mimosa*\). When disturbance rates in both invasive occupied and unoccupied sites are the same, recruitment and mortality effects are exactly balanced, and successful invasion is independent of the disturbance. When disturbance rates between invasive occupied and unoccupied sites differ a novel mechanism occurs where the invasive can promote disturbance in sites it already occupies. This provided the insight that **single large\-scale disturbances can result in permanent, dramatic shifts in invasive abundance. Conversely, reducing the population below a critical threshold can cause extinction.** **This work** \(with \[R1\] and \[R2\]\) **provides a critical theoretical** **framework** for the more effective and nuanced management of invasive species\- an increasingly important point when considering the effects of human action and climate change on disturbance regimes **\[R3\].** 

 Use of theory to model specific invasive populations nationally and internationally 

 In addition to this general underpinning theory, Rees has also investigated the management methods of specific invasive non\-native species. For example, his team developed a mathematical model of water hyacinth growth which can be used to assess the impact of a reduction in nutrients on plant dynamics and for planning population control **\[R4\]**. At an international level, Rees helped develop a model for pine expansion in ungrazed and grazed grassland in New Zealand. Pine invasion is a major problem in this country and **by incorporating uncertainty into the modelling process the confidence in the management strategies recommended was greatly increased \[R5\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Invasive non\-native species \(INNS\) represent a major threat to the UK environment and cost the UK economy on average £1.8 billion per year, mainly affecting agriculture, forestry, horticulture, utilities, construction, and transport infrastructure **\[S1\]**. They have detrimental effects on the native species they supplant, as well as on human health and business. Their presence has accelerated with the expansion of global trade. Research at Sheffield has shaped **national and international environmental policy and practice to combat INNS.** 

 The Non\-Native Species Secretariat \(NNSS\) acts as the central hub in Great Britain for the collection and dissemination of information regarding INNSs, with the Non\-Native Risk Assessment Panel \(NNRAP\) the principle body informing the NNSS of the risks that different species pose. **This evidence directly informs the Great Britain Programme Board which consists of senior representatives of several major agencies \(including Defra, Scottish and Welsh Governments, the Forestry Commission, HMRC, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee\) who use the evidence to prioritise activities and fulfil legislated commitments**. 

 Rees was invited to join the NNRAP in 2007. His research on modelling invasive species has impacted their work via both the insight provided into specific species and, at a wider level, by providing the general critical theory required to judge whether the risk assessments implemented for a spectrum of invasive species are appropriate. As the sole plant scientist on the panel, ‘Professor Rees’s work on the NNRAP has had **‘an important impact on the strategic approach to dealing with invasive non\-native species in GB**’ **\[S2\]**, as detailed below. 

 Plant species have been banned and eradication protocols implemented at a national level 

 Under the auspices of Defra, the code of practice in England dictates that ‘the environmental authority must consider available information on its likely impacts, in particular any risk assessment carried out by the Great Britain Non\-Native Species Secretariat’ **\[S3\]**. This authority encompasses the Secretary of State, the Environment Agency, Natural England, and the Forestry Commissioners. Although Rees aids in analysing all species risk assessments, the application of the modelling approach developed in his research, coupled with his botanical expertise, has in particular ensured that the assessments of *Parrot’s Feather, Water Fern, Floating Water Primrose, Floating Pennywort, two species of Water Primrose, and Australian Swamp Stonecrop* were fit\-for\-purpose. As a result of these assessments **, The Wildlife and Countryside Act was updated in 2014 and these species were banned from sale in England and Wales \[S2\]\[S4\]**. In addition, the assessments have underpinned actions to eradicate selected invasive species. For example, in 2010, based on NNRAP advice, NNSS identified a high risk of establishment of water primrose \(an economic pest due to clogged waterways and drainage streams, and increased the risk of flooding\) and initiated an eradication programme **.** As stated by the Senior Technical Advisor, Environment Agency **“ **I have no doubt that the 2014 ban was crucial to the potential success of our eradication programme”** and *“if our \[the UK’s\] intervention had been left any later I doubt we would still be aspiring to achieving eradication”* **\[S5\]**. 

 **The UK has seen a decrease in the area of surviving water primrose coverage from 858.5m<sup>2</sup> in 2017 to less than 100m<sup>2</sup> in 2019 \[S5\]. This has been achieved at a cost of just £10,000 \[S5\] per year instead of the project cost of £241,908,000 if the risk was left unchecked for longer \[S6\].** The programme has resulted in greater success in eradicating water primrose in England than can be seen in other countries that have been invaded by the species, such as France and Japan \[S7\]. 

 Improved management of the threat of non\-native species by local communities 

 Local Action Groups \(LAGS\) have played a key role in the control of widespread non\-native species, but also for awareness raising in communities **\[S5\]**. NNRAP \(via NNSS\) provides vital support for these groups. For example, all NNRAP risk assessments are available online, with detailed fact sheets on identification, impacts, and control methods for 300 INNS \( [http://www.nonnativespecies.org/factsheet/index.cfm](http://www.nonnativespecies.org/factsheet/index.cfm)\). **This resource has enhanced the knowledge of more than 50 LAGs who report that “ **the work of the NNSS and NNRAP are vital for our operations”** to target species and inform management guidance.** Representatives from these LAGs have stressed the importance of the information on the website and the NNSS workshops to enable them to train volunteers and raise awareness with landowners to tackle INNS **\[S8\]**. 

 Critical theory from plant population dynamics has influenced EU legislation and regulatory practice. 

 Non\-native species invasions are an international problem, costing the EU an estimated €12 billion per year. The work of NNRAP has guided international standards in this area, informing EU risk\-assessment templates, and the modelling methods used to ensure that risk assessments are appropriate. **Consequently, many species have been banned in the EU based on NNRAP findings \[S2, S9\]**. In addition, Rees was appointed to an EFSA \(European Food Safety Authority\) working group on non\-target terrestrial plant risk assessment in 2013, resulting in the publication “Scientific Opinion addressing the state of the science on risk assessment of plant protection products for non\-target terrestrial plants” in 2014 **\[S9\]**. These assessments are used to develop and implement new concepts and approaches in EFSA’s risk assessment practices, thus **“ **Rees’ work has resulted in critical theory from plant population dynamics being used to underpin scientific advice used at both European and international levels**” \[S10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In England, half of frail older people will die within two years of an urgent care episode. One million older people are admitted to UK hospitals annually, using two\-thirds of hospital beds at a cost of >£5 billion p/a. Over the last 15 years, researchers at the University of Leicester have developed a range of novel, urgent care attuned interventions, some resulting in a 10% reduction in hospitalisations. Care models based on these interventions have been successfully implemented in over 100 hospitals nationally and internationally in Sweden, Finland, Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Australia and Canada, enabled by the Acute Frailty Network led by Conroy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Frailty describes a state of vulnerability, identification of which helps clinical teams understand why apparently innocuous challenges such as minor infections can result in catastrophic declines in patients’ function. It is complex in nature, requiring delivery of multifaceted, multidisciplinary responses to achieve improved patient outcomes. Frailty impacts massively on hospitals, with the one million frail older people admitted occupying \~two\-thirds of English hospital beds at a cost of almost £5 billion annually **\[E1\]**. Research at the University of Leicester led by Professor Simon Conroy demonstrated that 75% of these patients have one or more adverse outcomes within 90 days of an urgent care episode and up to 50% mortality by two years **\[R1\]**. Conroy’s team developed a Hospital Frailty Risk Score \(HFRS\) that, for the first time, allowed healthcare systems internationally to implement reliable and systematic stratification of older people admitted to hospital \[ **R2\]**. The significance of the HFRS was recognised by winning the Royal College of Physicians’ 2019 The Lancet research award. Their research demonstrated that these patients benefit from holistic care via a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment \(CGA\); adopting this approach reduces the Number Needed to Treat \(NNT\) to 17 to prevent 1 death **\[R3\]**. Conroy’s research identified a major evidence gap for CGA in urgent care settings **\[R4\]** and was subsequently able to demonstrate the efficacy of new provision models at the acute and community care interface, in emergency departments and across the whole healthcare system **\[R6\]**. 

 In 2012, Conroy co\-authored the ‘Silver Book’ quality care guidelines **\[R5\]** which >20% of UK hospitals had adopted by 2016. This highly influential output established the crucial evidence base required to underpin service developments in healthcare settings. Since publication, it has been downloaded over 200,000 times. It has been used nationwide to promote improvements in urgent care for frail older people and informed NHS policy including NHS building design guidance **\[E4\]** and the NHS RightCare Frailty Toolkit **\[E5\]**. The significance of this research led in 2015 to the creation of the Acute Frailty Network \(AFN\) and Conroy’s appointment as national Clinical Lead. In this capacity, Conroy has supported over 100 UK hospitals in their development of urgent care responses for frail older people with substantial positive outcomes. The importance of the AFN’s work was recognised in 2018 when it won the Royal College of Physicians’ ‘Excellence in Patient Care Award’ for quality improvement. 

 Implementation of Conroy’s research has expanded to non\-geriatric settings, for example in cancer care and surgery, to facilitate embedding of ‘frail friendly’ care pathway mechanisms throughout the healthcare system **\[R7\]**. This led to the development of the Specialised Clinical Frailty Network \(SCFN\), which since 2018 has worked with 61 cardiac, renal, cancer, critical care, spinal, vascular, cardiac, and neurosurgical teams to embed specialist frailty\-attuned care within their services. Many collaborators demonstrated improvements in both care processes and health outcomes for frail older people in their care. Conroy personally was awarded the William Farr medal in 2018, a singular annual award for leadership in the care of older people, and was profiled in BMJ Confidential in 2017.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Since 2005, Conroy’s team have improved outcomes for older people with acute care needs in emergency departments, acute medical units and specialised services. Their work has improved identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes, developed and implemented novel interventions at all levels of urgent healthcare provision, and shaped global policy and practice relating to frailty. Through a unique combination of high\-quality research and individual expertise utilising the apparatus of the AFN \(itself created and led by Conroy\), the Leicester team have translated research to impact nationwide and internationally. 

 **Identifying Frailty** 

 Conroy’s research conclusively demonstrated the robust, timely and user\-friendly predictions of adverse outcomes and mortality provided by the Clinical Frailty Scale \(CFS\). By 2016, >two\-thirds of English hospitals had adopted the CFS with 100% adoption achieved by December **2020 \[E2, E14\]**. As a result of their expertise, the Leicester team were commissioned to author updated national policy guidelines to ensure this target is met **\[E3 \(Citing R2, R3\)\]**. Conroy’s team developed, validated and supported the implementation of the HFRS as a benchmarking tool for use at health system level \(downloaded by over 80 health systems in England **\[E10\]** \- see:  [Frailty Opportunity Identifier Tool](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffuture.nhs.uk%2FSDEC_CommunityofPractice%2Fview%3FobjectId%3D22746256%2322746256&data=02%7C01%7Cspc3%40leicester.ac.uk%7C5f6271ce2b674f03fa2508d86486eed7%7Caebecd6a31d44b0195ce8274afe853d9%7C0%7C1%7C637369877976974997&sdata=8mR%2Bk1mV1htpD0UX4j%2BL5zgcGHFzyHnxhXEhg0%2F54UM%3D&reserved=0), NHS England\). The HRFS underpins NHS work on outcomes\-based healthcare, and Conroy is supporting its implementation in Europe, North America, Singapore and Australia. 

  

 Conroy supported over 100 UK hospitals in development of urgent care responses for frail older people. Many have achieved substantial benefits including 38% reduced admissions, 54% reduced length of stay and a 35% reduction in the number of frail older people hospitalised for >10 days. Based on the Audit Commission’s £59 daily bed\-day cost, hospitals implementing AFN recommendations saved \~£372,379 annually, translating to a national saving of up to £30.5million to the NHS achieved by participating sites. Demonstrations of the positive patient impact include Medway NHS Trust who achieved a 58% reduction in patients aged 75\+ staying in hospital for >7 days, Wolverhampton NHS Trust who reduced readmissions within 30 days by 45% and Bournemouth NHS Trust whose average stay length reduced by 24%, saving up to £3million p/a **\[E7\]**. The Acute Frailty Network created the Clinical Frailty Scale \(CFS\) app, free to download. In the first three months following launch, there have been over 5000 downloads worldwide. The feedback from colleagues has been very positive, with comments revealing that they have found it very helpful in their assessment of older people with frailty: “This is a great resource, simple and intuitive to use”; “…will save me digging in diary cover for laminated version and trying to read the small print\!”; “Fantastic, very useful”; “This is very helpful, it simply works\!”; and “Very helpful, makes life so much easier” **\[E10\]**. 

 In addition to practice changes, Conroy’s research also resulted in significant structural changes within the NHS. In 2017 Western Sussex Hospitals Trust established a permanent Acute Frailty Programme Board with hospital\-wide, multi\-disciplinary representation as a direct result of Conroy’s research and guidance **\[E8\]**. Similar changes were also made in the North East and North Cumbria ‘Care Closer to Home’ programme which fully implemented Conroy’s research findings and recommendations **\[E8\]**. Conroy and SCFN colleagues led on national intercollegiate frailty guidance for critical care decision\-making during COVID outbreak, 2020 – also used in Canada **\[E12\]**. 

 Internationally, Conroy’s work has led to structural changes in Malaysia, Singapore, Canada **\[E10\]** and Ireland **\[E8\]**. Ireland East Hospitals Group \(IEHG\), the largest hospital group in Ireland, collaborated with AFN to design and implement frailty\-friendly care pathways across their 11 sites. Conroy visited IEHG to deliver masterclasses and guide implementation. Prior to this, IEHG had no operating screening process. Within 1 year, 98% of patients >75 were screened for frailty on arrival with positive results triggering CGA; 75% completed within 24hrs. IHEG achieved a two\-day median reduction in LOS for admissions to geriatric wards and hospital\-wide reductions of 0.7% admission rate for patients 75\+, 2.1% bed days, and 6% reduction in Emergency Department conversion rates **\[E8\]**. 

 **Developing, Implementing and Evaluating Acute Frailty Interventions** 

 Conroy’s Leicester Emergency Frailty Unit’s considerable success resulted in similar services being established in >57% of UK acute hospitals. The AFN is the largest improvement collaborative of its kind globally. It focusses on the first 72hrs of urgent care for frail older people, disseminating cutting\-edge best practice via site visits, training and workshops to >80 UK sites. 

 Embedding CGA in care pathways is critical to achieving improvements beyond specialist geriatric units. This was enabled by Conroy’s ground\-breaking ‘Hospital\-Wide Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment’ \(HoW\-CGA\) study which provided new tools to enable CGA hospital\-wide. HoW\-CGA succeeded in building capacity and capability in hospital staff, such as those in the Specialised Clinical Frailty Network \(SCFN\) **\[E11\]**. SCFN’s focus on frailty identification and patient\-centred treatment decisions using QI data underpinned by the HoW\-CGA care bundle has improved outcomes in renal, cardiac, chemotherapy, complex spinal surgery, neurosurgery and intensive care areas. Collaborating sites receive continued expert support via learning opportunities, national events, masterclasses, site visits and specialised service principles. All sites now use CFS as standard, with six changing patient\-related decision making and improving patient outcomes. 

 In 2016, Conroy authored European curricula on emergency physician geriatric competencies accompanied by ‘bootcamps’ and annual symposia to support uptake. This led to adoption of the approach in many nations including Germany and Italy and the development of a White Paper on Geriatric Medicine in Canada **\[E9\]**.  During the COVID\-19 pandemic, Conroy was lead author of national intercollegiate frailty guidance for critical care decision\-making **\[E15\]**. 

 **Influencing Policy and Practice** 

 In 2018, Conroy’s team interviewed global experts in acute care for frail older people. The results revealed that despite increasing awareness of potential harm/deterioration in acute and emergency medicine for frail patients, care provision remained a global concern. Feedback highlighted AFN as the most impactful initiative, praised for establishing a conclusive evidence base to guide and underpin service developments and for achieving rapid service improvements. The ‘Silver Book’ was also identified as crucial in both promoting frailty\-attuned urgent care improvements and in the genesis of the AFN **\[E13\]**. The unique combination of formal and real\-world evidence generated and significant policy influence sees the Leicester team highly regarded in the healthcare world as innovators. Their hosting of >45 visits from both national and international teams for care process guidance to enable local implementation of the Leicester model resulted in direct implementation in 20% of UK hospitals and 50% changing policies response to it. 

 Conroy’s expertise was instrumental in formulating the 2018 NICE Guideline on emergency care for adults **\[E6 \(citing 4 outputs including R4\)\]** and resulted in international adoption of CGA in Italy, Germany, Australia **,** New Zealand, the USA **\[E9\]** and Ireland **\[E8**\]. The NHS has benefitted substantially from Leicester research: care pathway and treatment procedure policies pertaining to frail older people have been shaped by the AFN, HRFS and HoW\-CGA success culminating in the 2019 NHS RightCare Frailty Toolkit **\[E5\]**. This defines assessment methods, system benchmarks, improvement identification protocols and system development support to all NHS CCGs to enable implementation of Leicester’s research nationally, thus improving long\-term patient outcomes nationwide **\[E5 \(citing AFN Case Studies, R5, E3 and E8\)\]**. This was followed by the inclusion of CGA as an expected standard protocol in the NHS Long Term Plan 2019 **\[E1\]**. 

 Beyond clinical practice, Conroy’s research has redefined NHS hospital design. The team established the UK’s first ‘frail\-friendly’ emergency department in Leicester, the success of which directly led to updated NHS guidance on proper building design to ensure full, equitable access for frail patients nationwide. Banerjee sat as an expert panel member on the drafting committee of this policy and the ‘Silver Book’ is cited extensively as a key evidence/guidance source **\[E4\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our research on Japanese knotweed control has had socio\-economic, environmental and legal impact. Following the largest ongoing field trial of industrial control methods for Japanese Knotweed, we identified best practice for the long\-term management of this invasive weed. These findings effected benefits in two key areas: **A\)** widespread improvement in Japanese knotweed management practice through stakeholder engagement and the start\-up company Advanced Invasives, and uptake of our best practice guidance as a benchmark standard in civil court cases, and **B\)** change to the Law Society of England and Wales conveyancing TA6 documentation recognising most knotweed control plans do not eradicate the plant. The latter affects ca. 1,000,000 conveyancing events per year in England and Wales. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **The Plant:** In the UK, Continental Europe and North America, Japanese knotweed \(JK\) is a widely distributed invasive plant which: 1\) dominates habitats, reducing biodiversity; 2\) reduces amenity value of properties and recreational areas; and 3\) impacts house sales and land usage. JK is a large plant that produces extensive belowground rhizome \(root\) networks, which support rapid early season aboveground growth that outcompetes native plants. Rhizomes extend several metres in diameter and depth from aboveground growth, retain capacity for extended dormancy and consequently, are resilient to many control treatments. 

 **The Problem:** Despite costing ca. GBP165,600,000 p.a. to manage JK infestations in the UK, prior to our research, no field or pot\-based test had been sufficiently scaled to account for several metres of horizontal rhizome extent and none had simultaneously tested physical treatments, all EU registered herbicides, application methods and integrated \(physical \+ chemical\) treatments. UK Environment Agency’s “ *The Knotweed Code of Practice”* \(2006, 2013\) and UK JK control industry management method selection was therefore undermined by insufficient empirical data, providing little clear stakeholder guidance for herbicide selection. Within the information vacuum, reputable companies and trade bodies acting in their clients \(and stakeholders\) best interests were pitched against others providing untested, ineffective and costly control methods to the detriment of the industry and wider environment. Indeed, the UK Government withdrew *The Knotweed Code of Practice* in 2016 recognising increasing civil liability claims around JK encroachment and mismanagement, and deficient empirical data supporting it. 

 **The Research**: This was undertaken with an industry\-sponsored EU convergence programme\-funded grant \[ **G1**\] 2011\-2015 by **Eastwood** and **Jones** and longer\-term field assessment research from 2015\-present.  The latter was a collaboration between SU and start\-up company Advanced Invasives Ltd. Nineteen marketed JK treatment methods were tested for ability to control JK infestation. As well as allowing comparison of approach in a single study, the key innovation was the unique size of the randomised 225 m<sup>2</sup> treatment plots and >3\-year assessment duration providing the largest and longest running \(2011\-present\) infield assessment of JK control. 

 We showed that effective JK control is achieved using glyphosate, applied biannually as a spray in summer and autumn, or annually in autumn via injection or spray \[ **R1**\]. We recommended treatment approaches that integrate with above\- and belowground mass flow movement within the plant, an approach we termed “ **the Four\-Stage Model**”. Notably, labour\-intensive physical treatments and some herbicides with on\-label approval for JK control were ineffective when evaluated at field\-scale: we recommended their deletion from JK control guidance. Critically, no single treatment effected full control and management plans should include multiple years’ treatment. Furthermore, while glyphosate provides good control of aboveground growth, the belowground rhizome is dormant and still viable \[ **R1\-R2**\]. 

 The legal ramifications of herbicide\-induced belowground JK dormancy to the Law Society’s conveyancing document TA6 was outlined by **Draper** and **Eastwood** in a Law Society of England and Wales discussion document \[ **R3**\]. The inaccuracy of the wording in the TA6 documentation discussed in **R3** led in 2018 to engagement with the Law Society’s Conveyancing and Land Law Committee and subsequent acceptance of the need to change the existing TA6 form.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **\(A\). Uptake of improved Japanese knotweed management practice in the UK** 

 Prior to and since \[ **R1**\], **Eastwood** and **Jones** engaged government, industry and land managers to promote evidence\-based best practice of JK control. As a result of \[ **G1**\] and \[ **R1**\], Advanced Invasives Ltd \( **Ai**\) was founded by **Jones** in 2016 to deliver in\-field research and product testing, expert witness services, complex site surveying, and best practice training and guidance using the four\-stage model. While a UK\-wide problem, Wales has the highest infestation levels outside of JK’s native range and therefore provides leadership in developing best practice internationally. 

 Post \[ **R1**\], **Swansea University** and **Ai** have provided evidence\-led management guidance to significant landowners, e.g. Welsh Government \(WG\), Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd, Wales and Borders at Network Rail \[ **C1\-C3**\]. Our JK working standards guidance as defined in \[ **R1**\] and \[ **R2**\], adopted throughout Wales, was further supplemented by **Ai\-**commissioned community guidance \[ **C4**\] to raise public awareness levels through the WG landscape website \(173 downloads August to December 2020\). 

-  *“WG and its sponsored body, Natural Resources Wales \(NRW\) manage, operate and own 7% of Wales’ land area \(more than 14,500 hectares\)* …. *Welsh Government adopted the practical application of the Swansea research for knotweed control, for example the South, North and Mid\-Wales Trunk Road Agencies now manage c1,300 km of road assets according to this research”* \[ **C1**, Chair of the Wales Biodiversity Partnership Invasive Non\-Native Species Group\]. 

-  *“Over the past two years, practical application of the Swansea research for knotweed control has helped us to better manage extensive plant growth across 2,700 kilometres of track and 671 affected properties through reduced treatment frequency and shorter effective treatment timeframes. …. the use of glyphosate\-based herbicide cuts long\-term management timeframes from an indeterminate duration \(greater than 10 years\) to greater than 95 % control of knotweed plants within 2\-3 years of the initial treatment.”* \[ **C2**, Regional Asset Manager, Wales and Borders Network Rail\]. 

-  *“Jones et al. research has been adopted by all local authority partners in our latest INNS controls programme covering eight local authority areas in South Wales”* \[ **C3**, Invasive Plant Species Officer – Caerphilly County Borough Council\]. 

 Trade bodies and national companies have also adopted our guidance: 

-  “*In my role as Chair I have heard from many members that they are applying aspects of Dr. Jones’s 2018 research with regards to knotweed management and it has saved them time, money and labour” and “The Amenity Forum needs evidence\-based research to inform best practice, reduce environmental impacts and inform policy makers. As such, the Japanese knotweed research conducted at Swansea University ….. is vital to helping us to achieve our standards\-raising objectives*” \[ **C5**, Chair Amenity Forum Trade Org UK\] 

-  *“Following the release of this research, Knotweed Services \(UK\) Ltd now operate using the 4\-stage model which identifies the optimal time for treatment”* \[ **C6**\]. 

 As the number of legal cases relating to JK have increased, businesses and land managers have adopted our research to demonstrate best practice guidance in court cases where improper treatment or JK encroachment through poor management is brought by a plaintiff. Conversely, plaintiffs highlight \[ **R1**\] recommendations in cases where inadequate control methods have been employed. 

-  “Jones et al provided much needed empirical data for defining appropriate Japanese knotweed management. It has been formative in establishing the scope of the ‘measured duty of care’ for a party with this ‘natural hazard’ on their land.” \[ **C7** *,* Barrister, Hardwicke Law\]. 

 **\(B\). Change to The Law Society of England and Wales conveyancing TA6 documentation.** 

 **Eastwood** and **Draper’s** article \[ **R3**\] addressed the legal implications for the inappropriate use of the term eradication when the plant could be dormant belowground without a house seller being aware. Consequently, **Draper’s** active engagement with the Law Society \(guided by **Eastwood**\) coincided with a House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee report \(to which **Jones** had provided verbal and written depositions, \[ **C8** pages 11,16, 26\]\) that recommended the LS review wording of the question in its Property Information Forms \[ **C8**, page 37, recommendation 6\]. 

 The TA6 required sellers to disclose \(a\) whether JK was or was not present on the property, and \(b\) whether a management plan was in place to “eradicate” JK if present. The Law Society accepted our arguments in \[ **R1\-R3**\] that eradication was an inappropriate term and a seller might not know whether belowground dormant rhizome was present. As a result, TA6 was updated to include a “don’t know” option for \(a\) and “eradication” in \(b\) was replaced in guidance with wording drafted by **Draper, Eastwood** and **Jones** that acknowledged the difficulty in promising eradication even after a lengthy treatment plan. These changes were enacted in February 2020 \(TA6; 4th edition\) and is used for house sales in England and Wales by all Law Society members. The chair of the Law Society’s Conveyancing and Land Law committee noted: 

 “*The main impact of this change has been to remove the ambiguity on liability if belowground dormant Japanese knotweed is present for all house sales using the TA6 form \(for reference and scale, approximately 1 million residential property transactions are carried out in England and Wales per annum\).  It will also allow more informed decisions to be made on lending on affected properties that have a clear management plan in place, which I expect will lead to more mortgage offers being approved* \[ **C9**\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by José V. Rodríguez Mora and Robert Zymek explores the effect of trade on the incomes of regions and countries. Analyses and projections based on this research have informed the public and policy debate about the state of subnational economies, and the impact that Catalan, Basque and Scottish independence would have on trade and incomes. The research and its implications have received wide media coverage, stimulated economic discussions in regional parliaments in both Spain and the UK, and helped shape the priorities of the UK Industrial Strategy Council.

 2. Underpinning research 

 Since September 2012, Rodríguez Mora and Zymek have been working on a research programme that examines the effects of trade on the income of regions and countries. This programme combines Rodríguez Mora’s experience in macroeconomics and political economy with Zymek’s expertise in international economics. The research aims to quantify the contribution of trade to a region’s or country’s measured per\-capita GDP. It explores how changes in trade ties affect local incomes. Rodríguez Mora and Zymek address these questions by combining insights from modern quantitative models of international trade with novel data on the value of trade flows within and across countries. 

 One strand of the research, led by Rodríguez Mora, starts from the observation that the value of trade flows between regions within countries is many times larger than the value of trade flows between regions across country borders. This observation can only be reconciled with trade models if political borders have a large negative effect on trade over and above the effect of directly observed tariffs and trade barriers \(the “border effect”\). 

 Rodríguez Mora \(together with David Comerford, Strathclyde\) uses a combination of economic theory and data to make predictions, under different scenarios, about the likely effect of the break\-up of a country – resulting in a new border – on the trade and income of the country’s former constituent regions. To do this, a counterfactual experiment is considered in which trade frictions from the new border match those in the data from a suitably chosen pair of countries. For example, for the case of a hypothetical border between Scotland and the rest of the UK \(rUK\), the observed border friction between the Republic of Ireland and the UK is chosen as a benchmark. With the Irish\-UK friction at its new border, the long\-run GDP of an independent Scotland would be 8.4% lower than it is currently. 

 The other strand of the research, led by Zymek, shows how to assess the contribution of trade to currently observed income differences between regions and countries. The previous literature on “development accounting” had sought to attribute such income differences only to differences in regions’ endowments of productive resources, and their productivity. Zymek’s work \(together with Alejandro Cuña, Vienna\) uses recent advances in trade theory to incorporate the role of countries’ trade linkages into the traditional “development accounting” framework. It then shows how to measure these linkages consistently across countries using detailed information on countries’ trade and production patterns from the World Input\-Output Database. 

 The research makes a methodological and a quantitative contribution to the academic literature. It shows how to measure the portion of international income differences that can be attributed to differences in countries’ trade linkages in a way consistent with modern trade theory. It then applies this methodology to the countries covered in the World Input\-Output Database. In doing so, the paper demonstrates that differences in international linkages may be as important as differences in countries’ productive resources for explaining why some countries are rich and others poor. It also finds that ignoring the role of trade may have caused earlier studies to overstate the magnitude of productivity differences between countries. 

 Although the two research strands resulted in separate outputs, Rodríguez Mora and Zymek collaborated both formally and informally throughout their work on these projects. After Zymek joined the UoA in 2011, Rodríguez Mora acted as his mentor, creating the space for two\-way exchange on the shared central themes of the research. They jointly supervised three PhD students, developed a joint research proposal and organised two conferences to build an academic network around their work together. The first was a two\-day conference held in June 2014 that involved 12 speakers from Europe and the US with keynote lectures from James Anderson \(Boston College\) and Enrico Spolaore \(Tufts University\). The second conference in June 2020 was an online event involving 12 speakers and discussants. Rodríguez Mora and Zymek presented work on trade, macroeconomics and regional economics at both events \[3.1\]. 

 Rodríguez Mora’s was invited to present his research at the April 2018 panel meeting of *Economic Policy*, a leading journal for the dissemination of academic insights to policymakers \[3.2\], where the results were subsequently published \[3.3\]. Zymek presented his research at the prestigious, invitation\-only conference of the World Bank’s International Comparison Programme \(ICP\) at Georgetown University in Washington DC in May 2018 \[3.4\]. It is published in the CESifo working paper series and a revision has been requested at the *Journal of the European Economic Association*, a leading general\-interest journal in economics \[3.5\].

 4. Details of the impact 

 Rodríguez Mora and Zymek have informed the debate about the economics of regions and countries by disseminating their research to non\-academic audiences through non\-technical publications, media appearances and engagement with key stakeholders in the UK and Spain. 

 Rodríguez Mora has contributed significantly to the debate surrounding the economics of an independent Catalan state. Alongside other Spanish experts from a range of disciplines, he contributed a chapter to a general\-audience book on the political and economic costs of a break\-up of the Spanish state. The book sold approximately 6,000 copies in Spain and the launch event was watched by 2,000 people online. In another prominent public intervention, he co\-authored an article on Catalan independence in *El País*, Spain’s second most circulated national newspaper. The article, which cites insights from Comerford and Rodríguez Mora’s research, was shared 160 times by social media users on Twitter – including some prominent political figures, such as the current Spanish Minister for Health \[5.1\]. 

 The Scottish independence referendum in September 2014 triggered interest in Rodríguez Mora’s research in the British media. His findings on the economic impact of a possible Scotland\-UK border were cited prominently in the *Daily Mail* and *Daily Telegraph*. He has since been invited to give comments in the UK media \(including the BBC and *The Scotsman*\) on more than ten occasions – most frequently on the economics and politics of regional independence. In the wake of the un\-authorised and tumultuous Catalan independence referendum, Rodríguez Mora and his research were prominently cited in a *New York Times* article in October 2017. The article was shared over 250 times on Twitter alone \[5.2\]. 

 The dissemination of Zymek’s research on the appropriate measurement of economic activity has focused on engagement with relevant stakeholders in the national and international policy community. Between January 2016 and May 2018, Zymek presented his research to economists at the International Monetary Fund, the German Institute for Research in Economics \(DIW\), the World Bank, and the Bank of England. A non\-technical summary of Cuñat and Zymek’s research was published on VoxEU, a website for the dissemination of research to economists in government, international institutions and the private sector. VoxEU records half a million page views per month, and the post by Cuñat and Zymek had received nearly 4,000 reads within four days of its publication in October 2017 \[5.3\]. 

 As part of the 2014 conference on “Country Size and Border Effects in a Globalised World” mentioned above, an evening panel discussion on “The Economics of New Borders: Implications for Scotland” was held in central Edinburgh to showcase the methods economists use to evaluate the costs and benefits of independence and discuss the experience of other countries and the implications for Scotland. The panellists were Anderson \(Boston College\), Spolaore \(Tufts University\) and Stephen Farrington \(HM Treasury\), who at that time was responsible for the Treasury’s analytical work on the Scotland independence. The lively debate attracted an audience of about 80 participants including members of the public. Video recordings of the contributions by the two US\-based economists received a further 200 views online \[5.4\]. 

 Beyond broad dissemination, there is evidence that insights based on the research by Rodríguez Mora and Zymek reached political decision\-makers in Spain and the UK. Based on his research, Rodríguez Mora was invited to provide expert testimony in the Basque Parliament on the economic impact of Basque independence. He appeared before Parliament on 11<sup>th</sup> February 2015 and received 30 minutes to explain the contents of his research and its implications for the Basque Country in depth \[5.5\]. After the Spanish central government refused to provide an estimate of the economic cost of Basque independence, opposition parties in the Basque parliament used Rodríguez Mora’s independent evidence to argue in favour of the Basque country’s current self\-government arrangement in August 2015. Based on their statement, figures from Rodríguez Mora’s research were reported by Europa Press, a Spanish news agency, and re\-printed by regional media with a combined physical circulation of at least 300,000 copies \[5.6\]. 

 Zymek was approached by the David Hume Institute, an Edinburgh\-based think tank, to contribute his expertise on the international comparison of income and productivity for an independent report on the state of the Scottish economy. The opening chapter of the report measures Scottish productivity and attributes Scotland’s comparative performance in an international context to a range of productivity drivers. Key calculations performed for this analysis rely directly on the methods developed by Cuñat and Zymek. The report was published on 6<sup>th</sup> September 2018 and its contents were covered by the BBC, *The Financial Times*, *The Times*, *The Scotsman* and *The Herald*, among others \[5.7\]. Both main opposition parties in Scotland released press statements about the report, and it was discussed in the Scottish Parliament during First Minister’s Questions on 13<sup>th</sup> September 2018 \[5.8\]. 

 Following his involvement with this report, Zymek was offered a secondment at the UK Industrial Strategy Council, to assist with a review of the evidence on UK regional productivity differences. The evidence review was presented to the public in February 2020 by the Chairman of the Council together with Zymek at an event attended by 70 high\-profile delegates from government, think tanks and the private sector \[5.9\]. The event was prominently covered by *The Financial Times*, *The Times*, *The Guardian*, *The Telegraph*, *Reuters* and *Bloomberg* \[5.10\]. The report highlights a possible mismeasurement of UK regional productivity differences, based on the arguments developed in the research of Cuñat and Zymek, resulting in a crucial evidence gap. It identifies filling this gap as a strategic priority for the Industrial Strategy Council. Zymek was subsequently invited to discuss the implications of the report and his research for the UK Internal Market Bill in a small\-group meeting with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 22<sup>nd</sup> June 2020 and in a private phone call with the Scottish Finance Secretary on 22<sup>nd</sup> July 2020 \[5.11\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Wilson’s research has been instrumental in maintaining trust in the use of confidential patient information in the NHS. It has led to changes in the way that core concepts such as confidentiality, implied consent, and public interest are interpreted by healthcare professionals, national\-level committees, and the National Data Guardian. Wilson’s research\-based ethical advice contributed materially to: the prevention of the implementation of the care.data project, thereby helping to protect the privacy of all English GP patients \(2014\); an Information Commissioner’s Office \(ICO\) finding that Google DeepMind and Royal Free had breached the Data Protection Act \(2017\); the withdrawal of an MoU between the Home Office and NHS Digital, preventing the mis\-use of patient data for immigration control purposes \(2018\); and the adoption across the NHS of a new principle for the use of data \(2020\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In a series of papers, Wilson rigorously analysed how health data can be used more effectively for the purposes of delivering care to patients, and to improve population health, while respecting duties of privacy and confidentiality \[ **R1, R2, R3, R4**\]. He argued that the state’s duties to protect and promote health should be articulated through the right to public health, and that this is the best way to reconcile the value of health with other values such as liberty and autonomy. \[ **R1**\] On this view, states which fail to take easy steps to reduce socially controllable threats to health violate their citizens' rights. Ways that states can violate this right include failing to collect the data necessary to facilitate public health planning. Wilson also argued that citizens’ reasonable expectations play a significantly larger role in justifying the shape and limits of state activity than has often been appreciated. In line with this account, Wilson developed a Public Value account for the NHS, which provides a reconciliation of the public interest in maintaining confidentiality and public trust, with the benefits that can come through commercial partnerships and sale of data. \[ **R5**\] 

 Underpinning research was supported by grants from EPSRC \[ **ii**\], NHS Digital \[ **iii**\], and a secondment to the Royal Society’s Science Policy Centre \[ **i**\]. Wilson was PI for \[ **ii**\], which provided an ethics framework for the GBP11,000,000 i\-sense Agile Early Warning Sensing Systems for Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Resistance collaboration. Wilson’s project examined how to build and maintain public trust in the context of novel mechanisms of disease surveillance such as the ethics of the use of Twitter data for disease detection. The project showed that much of the philosophical discussion so far has presupposed some implausible assumptions about what it is to waive a right, and that the concept of reasonable expectations is crucial for clarifying what counts as a violation of the right to privacy in a range of crucial cases involving inferring private information from public information. \[ **R3**\] 

 This account of privacy and reasonable expectations was crucial for advice Wilson provided to the National Data Guardian for Health and Social Care \(NDG\), Dame Fiona Caldicott, in a high\-profile case about the nature and limits of implied consent. Resolving the case made clear that a theoretical clarification of the nature of implied consent was necessary. With the NDG’s encouragement, Wilson fundamentally rethought the normative underpinnings of medical confidentiality \[ **R4**\], arguing that much of the role that had previously been assigned within guidance to implied consent should be assigned to reasonable expectations.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Patient data is essential for the effective functioning of the NHS. All users of NHS services, and all health professionals benefit from a system of governance that ensures patient data is used only in ways that appropriately balance the need for confidentiality against the benefits to be obtained from wider usage of data for research and service planning. Wilson’s research based ethical advice has been instrumental in maintaining trust in the use of confidential patient information in the NHS, contributing materially to: the prevention of the implementation of the NHS care.data project, thereby helping to protect the privacy of all English GP patients \(2014\); an Information Commissioner’s Office \(ICO\) finding that Google DeepMind and Royal Free had breached the Data Protection Act \(2017\); the withdrawal of an MoU between the Home Office and NHS Digital, thus preventing the mis\-use of patient data for immigration control purposes \(2018\); and the adoption across the NHS of a reasonable expectations principle for the use of data \(2020\). 

 **Maintaining Public Trust in NHS Digital’s Data Disseminations.** Wilson’s research was a key resource in preventing the implementation of the care.data project. Care.data was proposed to harvest data on every individual patient from English GP practices into a central database, without either anonymisation or allowing patients to opt out. Wilson was the ethicist for NHSD’s General Practice Extraction Service Independent Advisory Group \(GPES IAG\), which was tasked with providing independent advice on whether the project was in the public interest. Drawing on his work on the ethics of risk imposition \[ **R2**\], Wilson “led the development of the GPES IAG Public Interest Model”. \[ **A**\] As the then Chair of GPES IAG explains, this model “underpinned GPES IAG processes and recommendations” and “was instrumental in the group articulating its concerns about why care.data did not appear to be in the public interest.” \[ **A**\] GPES IAG’s role in opposing the policy was recognised by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology’s POSTNote 474, the subsequent Health Select Committee inquiry, and by the medical privacy NGO medConfidential, which described GPES IAG as “The one single body that stood up to care.data”. \[ **B**\] Care.data was “paused” in February 2014, and then finally abandoned in 2016. Wilson’s expertise was further recognised when in 2015 he was invited to become an independent member of NHSD’s Data Access Advisory Group \(DAAG\), which advised NHSD on how to maintain public trust in their data disseminations. The then Chair of GPES IAG, who also served as Chair of DAAG, states that Wilson’s contribution was “consistently valuable” \[ **A**\], bringing “increased rigour”, and “greater attention to the achievement of public benefits”. The committee’s advice contributed to a “wholesale move away from the use of confidential patient information for the routine planning, monitoring, and reimbursement of health and care services”, which “improved the protection of the confidentiality and privacy of millions of NHS patients’ records, without detriment to services.” \[ **A**\] In 2016, he was chosen as “a leading academic in the ethics of data sharing” \[ **C**\] to help NHSD to transition DAAG into a fully independent oversight group, the Independent Group Advising on the Release of Data \(IGARD\), and was IGARD’s ethicist \(2017–18\). NHSD’s Chief Medical Officer estimates that the work Wilson did with IGARD to maintain public trust and improve the ability of NHS data to improve patient outcomes benefited “hundreds of thousands of patients.” \[ **C**\] 

 **Advice to NDG on ethics, confidentiality, consent, and maintaining public trust in the NHS.** Wilson was appointed to the NDG’s Panel in 2016, “principally in virtue of his experience and contributions as an academic philosopher and ethicist” \[NDG for Health and Care, in **D**\]. Wilson was the first philosopher to be appointed to the NDG Panel, and as NDG relates, she “soon came to recognise that we had made an excellent decision in deciding, in general, to have an academic ethicist and philosopher on the panel and specifically, to recruit Wilson, due to the contributions that he has made individually.” \[ **D**\]. In 2018 Wilson joined the NDG’s Steering Group, which is a smaller group of closer advisers. Wilson has regularly represented NDG in national level meetings, and occasionally at Ministerial level meetings such as a roundtable on Artificial Intelligence on 28 February 2018, and the Global Digital Health Partnership \(with Directors General and ministers from twenty different countries\) on AI and Health in September 2018. \[ **D**\] 

 **Specifying the limits of implied consent through the concept of reasonable expectations.** 

 Wilson was key to the formation of the NDG position on implied consent and the common law duty of confidence from 2016 onwards. In one crucial case, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust shared the records of 1.6 million NHS patients with Google DeepMind for the development and testing of an App for detecting acute kidney injury. Royal Free claimed to have done so on the basis of patients’ implied consent, despite the fact that at the time that the data was shared, no steps were taken to make patients aware of this fact. The case was complex, and raised an important point of principle about the circumstances in which it is legitimate to infer that a patient has consented to disclosure of information. Wilson, as a member of the NDG Panel, met senior representatives from Royal Free and DeepMind on three occasions, in order to come to a considered judgement. NDG was subsequently asked by the Information Commissioner to give advice as part of a formal investigation into whether the Data Protection Act had been breached. \[ **D**\] Wilson, together with fellow NDG panel member Mark Taylor, argued that reasonable expectations are crucial in distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate uses of implied consent. \[ **R3, R4**\] As NDG explains, “Wilson significantly influenced the emphasis that I laid on the relevance of the legal concept of 'reasonable expectations’ in this case and in later work”. \[ **D**\] Wilson’s advice was crucial for shaping the NDG’s response to the Information Commissioner—namely that as the data usage by Royal Free was not in line with patients’ reasonable expectations, it therefore could not plausibly be claimed that patients had consented to it. \[ **D**\] This advice led directly to the finding by the Information Commissioner’s Office that the Royal Free had breached the Data Protection Act. \[ **E**\] As the Chair of the Health Research Authority explains, Wilson’s analysis was also deeply influential with the Health Research Authority \(HRA\): “The HRA accepted the conclusions of his work and built its regulatory response upon it. I chaired a multi\-agency meeting in which the implications were worked through, all predicated on the analysis that Professor Wilson had developed. Professor Wilson’s work on this specific issue has had a very wide impact on data governance in the NHS.” \[ **F**\] 

 **New reasonable expectations principle for information use in the NHS.** Wilson published \[ **R4**\], which provided NDG with the “intellectual underpinning” \[ **D**\] for the introduction of a new reasonable expectations principle for data use within the NHS. In a 2019 press release, the NDG praised \[ **R4**\] as “a very convincing article which outlines the importance of reasonable expectations and explores how this principle might be used to support appropriate information sharing.” \[ **G**\] NDG undertook a national consultation in 2020 on whether a new reasonable expectations principle should be adopted across the NHS. The consultation document explicitly mentions how \[ **R4**\] influenced the NDG position. \[ **H**\] Consultation respondents were overwhelmingly in favour, and the new principle published in December 2020. \[ **H**\] 

 **Change to Government Policy on the use of NHS Data for Immigration Enforcement.** Wilson’s contribution was important for shaping the line taken by the NDG for the Health Select Committee inquiry on the Memorandum of Understanding \(MoU\) between NHSD and the Home Office \(2017–18\), and through that changing government policy. The MoU allowed demographic information held by NHSD to be used for the purposes of tracing immigration offenders. While it was not illegal for NHSD to share patient information in this way, doing so was thought to be incompatible with the General Medical Council’s \(GMC\) confidentiality guidance. GMC is the regulatory body for doctors, and so any doctor who was involved with decision\-making about individual cases under the MoU would potentially be subject to censure and even to being struck off. It was nonetheless a policy that the Home Office, and NHSD claimed to be in the public interest. Wilson argued that NHSD’s public interest test was deeply flawed. Both NHSD’s most senior advisers on ethics and confidentiality—its Caldicott Guardian and Deputy Caldicott Guardian—were doctors. Thus, neither could be involved in the decision\-making about individual cases required under the MoU, because of the risk of their breaching the GMC Confidentiality Code. NHSD’s solution was to remove the Caldicott Guardian and his Deputy from its processes for determining the public interest in individual cases. Wilson argued this amounted to excluding the very persons who through institutional role and expertise would be best placed to determine the balance of public interest from making their contribution. As NDG explains, Wilson’s argument “became a central plank of the view I provided to the committee” \[ **D**\] and proved influential. Wilson’s argument was quoted prominently in the letter sent by the chair of the Health Select Committee to the CEO of NHSD on 29 January 2018, requesting that NHSD immediately withdraw from the MoU. \[ **I**\] It is quoted again on p. 23 of the subsequent Health and Social Care committee report. \[ **I**\] On 9 May 2018, the Government announced that the memorandum would be withdrawn and revised, reducing the number of cases that would fall under it by over 90%. \[ **I**\] Wilson was then asked to address a private meeting of NHSD’s Board on 5 June 2018, which focused on how the organisation might respond to the ethical criticisms made against it. As NHSD’s then Chief Medical Officer and Caldicott Guardian explains, NHSD’s Board “wanted a renowned expert in the field to advise them” and that Wilson’s name “came up from multiple sources as someone whose body of work had the potential to educate and advise the Board of a national body on the way forward… The impact was a change in organisational structure and adherence to \[Wilson’s\] advice.” \[ **C**\] 

 **NHS Covid\-19 App Ethics Advisory Board.** Wilson was a member of the Ethics Advisory Board \(EAB\) for the NHS Covid\-19 App in 2020. The project was extremely high\-profile, as it was initially envisaged in the government’s strategy that the App would play the leading role in controlling the spread of coronavirus. The Board’s advice and challenge was widely discussed, including in parliament, on the Radio 4 *Today Programme*, and was covered extensively in *The Telegraph* and *The Guardian* and other newspapers *.* EAB’s main formal output was a letter to the Secretary of State for Health on 24 April 2020, which laid out six principles and a framework for meeting the objectives of effective control of the epidemic and protecting privacy. The EAB Chair confirms that “Wilson was the most influential member in crafting the ethical principles that we established”, and explicitly recognises how Wilson’s work on public value and on public health ethics shaped the principles. \[ **F**\] EAB’s principles were warmly welcomed by the government, which committed to follow them \[ **J**\], and that these principles would be “the basis by which any future change requests for the app will be assessed.” \[ **J**\] Wilson continued to advise on behalf of NDG in the lead up to the launch of the second iteration of the App. A number of changes were made to the privacy information provided for App users on the basis of his advice, including making clear that “despite the anonymity of the alerts delivered through the app, users might sometimes be able to infer who among their contacts had tested positive for Covid”. \[ **G**\] As NDG makes clear, his advice “significantly influenced” her decision to endorse the App \[ **G**\] which had been downloaded over 20 million times by the end of 2020. \[ **F**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Grenfell Tower fire sent shockwaves around the world. Occupants of high\-rise buildings were too scared to sleep, while the social scandal raised significant questions for the government. The tragedy led to a desperate search to understand the causes, accompanied by urgent action to address them. Our work demonstrating the flammability of cladding products helped persuade the government to make residents of tall buildings safer by banning new installation of combustible facades and committing GBP3.5 billion for their replacement in existing towers. Replacement with non\-combustible cladding has significantly reduced resident’s anxiety, and led to dramatic shift towards the alternative mineral wool insulation in the UK. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Until 2010 our research looked at the fire behaviour of materials and construction products, including polymers, flame retarded polymers, electric cables and thermal insulation. This followed the massive growth in the use of plastics by the construction industry over the last 50 years, which currently accounts for 20% of total European plastic consumption. 

 Related work on products for industrial buildings, such as warehouses, used test rooms built from composite or ’sandwich’ panels, and showed the large differences in fire behaviour between combustible, such as polyisocyanurate \(PIR\), and non\-combustible insulating fillings, such as mineral wool. This work showed that even buildings made from products with the highest fire safety certification could still make a very large contribution to fire growth, both by burning themselves, and when they did so, by driving a five\-fold increase in the rate the contents burned \[1\]. 

 After the Grenfell Tower fire, a detailed study of the fire behaviour of common façade products showed the dangers in terms of flammability and smoke toxicity of the types of combustible products that are used to clad tall buildings \[2\]. Soon after the fire, we obtained samples of the main products used to construct ventilated ‘rainscreen’ façades, like that on Grenfell Tower. This was in direct response to the absence of any available information on the composition or fire behaviour of the materials and products used to clad buildings. For example, we found that polythene \(PE\) filled aluminium composite panels \(ACP\) contained three times more fuel than the fire retarded versions \(FR\). The insulation products, PIR and phenolic foam, were flammable although they were certified to have passed the regulatory tests. The results were reported to various Parliamentary and other regulatory groups as soon as they were obtained. 

 Following the Hackitt Review of Building Fire Safety Regulations, and in direct response to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government’s \(MHCLG\) deliberation on the fire safety of façades, we worked with: the Fire Protection Association \(FPA\)/RISCAuthority, the insurance industry's fire experts; Arup Ltd, Fire Safety Engineers; and Ash and Lacey, one of the UK's largest cladding manufacturer’s; to assess the fire behaviour and smoke toxicity using 5m facades in the BS8414 regulatory fire test. We used non\-combustible ACP, with different types of insulation, installed using normal industry practice. The results showed that even the highest\-rated ACP were incapable of resisting destruction by the fire, offering no protection to the underlying combustible insulation, which would then contribute to fire\-spread up the side of the building \[3\]. The work was subsequently written up as two peer reviewed papers. The first, on the burning behaviour, showed why all façade products should be non\-combustible, not just the outer panels. The second showed that the smoke flowing from the cavity of a burning façade would be toxic enough to incapacitate, and then kill, all the sheltering occupants \[4, 5\]. 

 A critical appraisal of the regulatory regime which permitted combustible materials on the exterior faces of tall buildings \(BS8414 and BR135\) was undertaken, highlighting the inadequacies of the BS8414 test, and the BR135 criteria used to confer approval of combustible façade systems \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In the immediate aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, public opinion focused on the polyethylene\-cored aluminium composite panels \(ACP\-PE\) as a major cause of the tragedy. Hull appeared on broadcast media more than 20 times \[A\] explaining that the flammability of ACP\-PE and combustible insulation foam had combined with disastrous consequences. Shortly afterwards, the UK’s Building Research Establishment \(BRE\) were instructed to undertake 7 tests using the BS8414 rig for the Department of Communities and Local Government \(DCLG\) on different combinations of ACP and insulation. The first two tests, using ACP\-PE were stopped, before the insulation became involved in the fire, for safety reasons \(as specified in BS8414\), and the two tests with fire retarded ACP and combustible insulation were stopped after a little longer, again for safety reasons, so the contribution of the insulation remained unknown. 

 In September 2017, Hull and Stec were invited to present their findings, later reported in a peer\-reviewed paper \[2\], showing the contribution of both insulation and polyethylene\-filled ACP, to an All\-Party Parliamentary Group, *The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee*. This was followed by a report in the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology POSTNOTE \[B\], which brought our work to the wider attention of MPs and peers. 

 In February 2018, Stec was appointed to the Review of Building Regulations chaired by Dame Judith Hackitt as a member of Working Group 6 Products and Classification, and outlined our work, showing that changes to the building regulations were necessary. The Working Group concluded that revision was required of the test standard that allowed combustible materials to be used on tall buildings \(BS 8414\) \[C\]. 

 In June 2018, Stec was also appointed as an Expert Witness to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry where she continues to investigate the effect of combustible materials on the tragedies that unfolded on the night of the fire. The progress of the Inquiry has been delayed due to the Covid\-19 pandemic \[D\]. 

 Hull and Stec have also independently reported their research to the All\-Party Parliamentary Group, *Fire Safety Rescue,* to a separate audience of MPs and peers, and also to the Local Government Association, in person to its Chairman, Lord Porter of Spalding, and his team. The results were also presented to the Royal Institute of British Architects \(RIBA\) Expert Group on Fire Safety who presented their conclusions to the Parliamentary Select Committee on Communities, Housing and Local Government \[E\]. 

 The work with the Fire Protection Association on combustible façades was reported directly to civil servants in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government \(MHCLG\), responsible for fire regulations in buildings, and published online before the announcement of the ban on combustible materials on tall residential buildings \[F\].  After our results had been reported to MHCLG, the Minister for Housing, the Rt Hon James Brokenshire, announced the ban on combustible products on all high\-rise residential buildings. That ban came into force in December 2018. However, the problem of combustible facades on existing tall residential buildings is massive, and remediation will take time. The government has pledged GBP3,500,000,000 to remove combustible cladding from all the 12,000 residential buildings over 18 metres and to provide loans to support remediation in the 77,500 residential buildings between 11 and 18 metres. Overall, 839,000 people are believed to live in buildings over 11 metres with some form of cladding \[G, H\]. From January to May 2020, the MHCLG consulted on a proposal to increase the scope of the ban to cover all buildings over 11 metres, the outcome is still awaited \(March 2021\). 

 The fire hazard of another form of combustible cladding, High Pressure Laminate \(HPL\), which is cheaper, and approximately 3 times more prevalent than ACP\-PE on high\-rise buildings, was shown in our paper \[2\] to have a much higher heat release and shorter ignition time than ACP\-PE, and contributed to the 6 deaths in the Lakanal House fire in July 2009. In January 2019, Hull highlighted the risks of fires, similar to Grenfell, in HPL clad buildings \[I\].  In March 2019 the Government announced plans to undertake limited testing of the safest fire\-retarded form of HPL, backed by non\-combustible insulation, in the BS8414 large\-scale scenario \[J\]. In January 2020, Hull’s research helped inform a legal case by Leigh\-Day Solicitors, who were preparing an action against the government for failing to protect the occupants of HPL clad buildings. As a result of increased awareness of the risks posed by HPL cladding from Hull’s research, in May 2020 the Housing Secretary, Rt Hon Robert Jenrick, MP, announced that the government would release a further GBP1,000,000,000 to replace unsafe non\-ACM cladding. This is predominantly combustible HPL cladding \[K\]. 

 As a result of our research and the changing regulatory landscape there has been a decline in the use of combustible materials and an uptake in non\-combustible alternatives on building exteriors. In a survey, the number of UK architects expecting PUR/PIR insulation usage to increase fell from 45% in 2016 to 17% in 2020, while over the same period, for glass wool insulation, usage expectation increased from 11% to 23%, and for stone wool insulation it increased from 21% to 37% \[L, M \]. Similar figures were reported for other European countries. In the UK the market share of non\-combustible insulation has increased significantly, with a corresponding decrease in plastic foam.  The Rockwool Group reported in their 2018 annual report that **“The focus on stronger fire\-safety regulation affected the UK and Polish markets, contributing to greater demand for non\-combustible stone wool building materials.”** \[N\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In April 2017, the **Dubai Government Excellence Programme \(DGEP\)** launched the second phase of their ‘Dubai We Learn’ \(DWL\) initiative, DWL2, in recognition of the need to provide more efficient and effective services to the residents of Dubai.  The research of Prof. Adebanjo into **benchmarking** supported DWL2 to adopt this vital tool for **performance enhancement in 11 government organisation \(GO\) projects for organisational learning and improved public services.** 

 Impacts leading from this contribution were as follows: **\(1\)** DGEP were enabled to **develop new capabilities** in 11 GOs*; **\(2\)** The Centre for Organisational Excellence Research \(COER, who applied Adebanjo’s research in support the DWL2\) **were enabled to improve benchmarking support services** to 11 GOs*.  Both contributions, directly to the DGEP and indirectly through the COER, contributed significantly the following: **\(3\)** All 11 GOs delivered **public service improvements and cost benefits, totalling £6m, to Dubai**; **\(4\)** Dubai Government Human Resources \(DGHR\) Department launched a **HR Think Tank improving Dubai Government’s HR policies to better meet performance priorities**; **\(5\)** Dubai Health Authority \(DHA\) launched a diabetes prevention programme, subsequently **reducing diabetes risk in 70% of treated patients**; **\(6\)** Dubai Police **improved personnel productivity from 40% to 72%.**

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Over 23 years, Professor **Adebanjo** has developed expertise in **benchmarking and facilitating organizational excellence**. Benchmarking is a systematic technique that enables organisations to improve performance by adapting best practices identified from other organisations. **Adebanjo** carried out research on sponsored benchmarking projects including the Global Benchmarking Network and the Asian Productivity Organisation. Based on this expertise, and particularly Output **3.1**, **Dubai Government Excellence Project \(DGEP\)** invited **Adebanjo** in 2016 to participate in the **Dubai We Learn \(DWL\)** project and specifically to lead research into success of coordinated benchmarking projects. Output **3.1**, conceptualized and led by **Adebanjo** and in partnership with the **Centre for Organisational Excellence Research \(COER\),** a benchmarking and business excellence research consultancy based in New Zealand \(research arm based at Massey University\), identified and evaluated the importance of benchmarking to the public sector. The DGEP is a programme of the General Secretariat of the **Government of Dubai** with a remit to support other government bodies in improving organizational performance and public services. The DWL initiative was the first\-of\-its\-kind to develop and deploy a co\-ordinated set of benchmarking improvement projects across multiple organisations to improve organizational learning and various public services. This makes the research that this first phase initiative entailed significant and ground\-breaking within the context of benchmarking. 

 Firstly, in May/June 2016 **Adebanjo** provided research input to four organisations \(Dubai Courts, Md. Bin Rashid Housing Estate, Dubai Public Prosecution, Dubai Road Transport Authority\) specifically *carrying out informal benchmarking and identifying potential benchmarking partners and best practices*. Secondly, in October 2016, **Adebanjo** was a member of an international panel of judges \(with Robin Mann of COER and Arndt Husar – Deputy Director at UNDP\) that *analysed 13 benchmarking projects and provided evaluation and feedback to all 13 project teams* **\(3.3 p15\)** Third, **Adebanjo** led research into *analyzing the suitability of benchmarking frameworks for coordinated initiatives; analyzing outcomes and successes of the 13 benchmarking projects; investigating particular factors, at programme and organisation level, that facilitated success of DWL; identifying and analyzing the challenges faced by DWL participants and proposing improvement ideas*. This research happened between July 2016 and February 2017.  **Adebanjo** specifically carried out the analysis of the data from the 13 organisations and based on this, **Adebanjo** led the writing of several chapters of Output **3.3** as well as the data analysis and writing of Outputs **3.2**, **3.4** and **3.5**. 

 Research findings were submitted to DGEP in February 2017 and subsequently published in different forms **\(3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5\)**. Findings from the research as presented in Output **3.3** were an important evidence base in the decision of DGEP to launch a previously unplanned set of 11 benchmarking projects in April 2017 \(DWL2\). **DWL2** enabled learning from the research indicated to be implemented in the 11 projects. Novel findings from DWL applied to DWL2 related to *mechanisms for enabling success of coordinated benchmarking projects*. Specifically, the research *identified 44 different activities/suggestions* **\(3.3 pp. 87\)** including: 

-  **Desktop research** should be carried out as a complement to site visits* 

-  *Each project needs a proper change management strategy to **reduce change resistance**.* 

-  *Benchmarking programs must provide **clear descriptions** of proposed actions, resources required, timelines and likely impact.* 

-  *It is very important to **capture all ideas for improvement** \- ideas may come from team members and stakeholders as well as from benchmarking partners.* 

-  *During project implementation it should be considered whether **suppliers or customers could also benefit** by implementing similar actions, and advice and help should be provided to them to do the same.* 

-  *Detailed analysis of project benefits, including financial benefits, should be **demonstrated**, even for government projects* 

-  **Reflections** on what has been implemented and learnt should be **used to generate new ideas for future projects**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The **Dubai Government Excellence Programme \(DGEP\)** launched the **‘Dubai We Learn’** **\(DWL2\)** initiative in early 2017 to foster an organisational learning culture and support innovation and delivery of citizen\-focussed services and continuous improvement in Dubai. This was driven by the mission of DGEP to *foster excellence in the delivery of government services*. DGEP themselves state that one of the reasons for applying research informed benchmarking and organisational learning expertise to their government operations was an acknowledgement that ‘there is now an expectation that achieving “value for money” in the public sector is business as usual and not an exception or a one\-off objective’ and that they needed to ‘ *change the way they serve society’* **\(5.1 pp7\)**.  In contributing to the more specific impacts described below, **Adebanjo’s** research aided DGEP in fulfilling the more general aims which framed DWL2, in particular to ‘ *become citizen focused and accountable to citizens’*; to ‘ *use technologies that make delivery of government services easier and more convenient for citizens’*; to ‘ *be smart’*; to *‘be connected and be seen as one service provider*’; and to ‘ *work with the private sector’* **\(5.1 pp7\)** 

 The **Centre for Organisational Excellence Research \(COER\)**, a benchmarking and business excellence consultancy based in New Zealand, was the strategic and technical partner to deliver the initiative. Through the adoption of benchmarking and its ability to improve organisational performance, both DGEP and COER were initial beneficiaries of **Adebanjo’s** research.  The realisation of those impacts then equipped both organisations to affect positive change for the **11 Dubai government organisations \(GOs\)** who participated in the second cycle of the DWL initiative \(DWL2, 2017–2018\). 

 <ins> **Initial impacts:</ins> <ins>The research equipped</ins> <ins>\(</ins><ins>1\)</ins> <ins>DGEP</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>\(2\)</ins> <ins>COER</ins> <ins>to effectively apply benchmarking tools to</ins> <ins>realise the aims of the Dubai We Learn \(DWL2\)</ins> <ins>initiative: to guide 11 Dubai government GOs to</ins> <ins>improve</ins> <ins>p</ins><ins>er</ins><ins>formance</ins> <ins>levels**</ins> 

 The underpinning research provided **DGEP** with the evidence to confirm that benchmarking could provide significant efficiencies, cost savings, improved citizen services and enhanced skills in GOs *. **The research** \(3.2 \- 3.5\) **formed an important part of the evidence in the decision by DGEP to initiate a second cycle of 11 DWL projects \(5.3\) leading eventually to the impacts observed in the GOs**. Demonstrating the acknowledgment of the benefits of benchmarking in this decision, and commitment to applying it to their government organisations \(GO\)s, the DGEP started off DWL2 in April 2017 stating that ‘ *From DGEP’s perspective benchmarking is considered a powerful tool for organizational learning and knowledge sharing*’ **\(5.1 pp6\).** 

 DGEP provided financial and infrastructural support for all of these projects to facilitate knowledge exchange not only for themselves, but also for the **11 GOs**. **COER** **used Adebanjo’s research to inform their key role of providing technical benchmarking support directly to the 11 GOs**. This knowledge exchange work included *training 71 employees in the GOs on the use of benchmarking techniques, providing information and continually advising and facilitating the 11 GOs in delivering their projects*. The agency role of COER was vital to the practical delivery of the 11 projects and was one of the primary routes through which the research was translated into the expertise provided for these GOs. As an initial beneficiary of the underlying research, **COER made important changes to its approach to supporting benchmarking projects**. Specifically, **Adebanjo’s** insights helped them *make changes to the priority and timing of desktop research provided to support the 11 GOs **\(5.2\)**.* *Desktop research was provided in the fourth month of the benchmarking projects and in greater detail in contrast to previous practice of provision in the eighth month.* *This change resulted in the 11 GOs identifying more improvement ideas and having more time to evaluate and deploy these ideas as presented below*. 

 <ins> **Next\-tier impacts:</ins> <ins>The research contributed to the success of the</ins> <ins>Dubai We Learn \(DWL2\)</ins> <ins>initiative to improve performance of the 11</ins> <ins>GOs</ins> <ins>through</ins> <ins>expertise in, and application of, benchmarking</ins><ins>:</ins>** 

 The 11 GOs gained direct support from **DGEP** and **COER** to develop benchmarking skills and deploy them to specific projects resulting in cost savings, operational efficiencies and improved public services. As described above, **Adebanjo’s** research fed into this process through both routes. 

 **\(3\) All 11 Government organisations \(GO\)s:** The GOs that participated in DWL2 were the following: Dubai Civil Aviation Authority, Dubai Corporation for Ambulance Services, Dubai Customs, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, Dubai Government Human Resources Department \(DGHR\), Dubai Health Authority \(DHA\), Dubai Municipality, Dubai Police \(DP\), Dubai Public Prosecution, General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs, and, Knowledge and Human Development Authority. Evaluations of the benchmarking projects by the 11 GOs have determined that collectively, they resulted in **c GBP6,000,000 financial benefits in the first year \(Apr 17 – Apr 18\), rising to tens of million GBP in subsequent years** \(5.1 pp.93\).** 

 Due to space limitations, select impact details of only three of the GO projects are showcased further, as follows: 

 **\(4\) Dubai Health Authority \(DHA\):** A 2017 study **\(5.1 pp57\)** found 15.2% Diabetic prevalence and 15.8% pre\-Diabetic rate in the Dubai populace – higher than Oman, Singapore and the UK and leading to high death rates \(203 per 100,000 population\) from Cardiovascular Diseases linked with Diabetes and Pre\-Diabetes. To address this, DHA joined the DWL2 initiative to launch a diabetes prevention programme comprising 5 key initiatives **\(5.1 pp.55\)** including the Hayati Diabetes management app **\(5.4\)**. Between April 17 and April 2018, **the community awareness campaign increased engagement from 36,739 residents \(2016\) to 47,303 \(2017\)**. Over the same period, the pilot prescribing programme led to **13% of severe risk female participants reducing to moderate risk** **\(5.1 pp.56\)**, and two newly established lifestyle clinics treated 158 patients \(2018\) leading to **diabetes risk reduction in 70% of patients** **\(5.5, 5.8\).** 

 **\(5\)** **Dubai Government Human Resources \(DGHR\):**  DGHR conducts research and benchmarking studies to update Dubai Government Human Resource law, systems, and policies. Previously, DGHR relied on outsourcing for research or limited in\-house capabilities. This approach was incapable of supporting future government needs. Participation in DWL2 was aimed at launching a HR Think Tank to shape the future of the HR profession, define key practices and influence local and regional practices. DWL participation during April 17 to April 2018 enabled DGHR **to identify 63 improvement ideas** **\(5.1 pp.47\)** **and launch an HR think tank** **\(5.7\)** in 2018. By August 2019, the think tank had completed two successful projects to support the HR function across government **\(5.9\)** 

 **\(6\) Dubai Police \(DP\):** In April 2017, DP launched a benchmarking project that continues to improve the maintenance and availability of police vehicles by providing standardized, regulated working hours for each maintenance/repair task. At the end of the DWL2 project \(April 2018\), **DP’s Maintenance Division** \(150 workers\) had an **increase in daily work hours from 2.4 hours to 5 hours and increase in labour productivity from 40% to 72% \(beating a 70% target\)**. The same period showed an **increase in vehicle availability from 88% to 95%, saving c GBP 3,000,000** **\(5.6, 5.10, 5.1 pp.69\).** These improvements are set to be *expanded throughout 254 sub\-departments of Dubai Police due to sharing the DWL benchmarking experience* **\(5.6, 5.10, 5.1 pp.69\)**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research at the University of Bath sponsored by the Chief Fire Officer’s Association \(CFOA\) has significantly impacted on Physical Employment Standards \(PES\) for the UK Fire and Rescue Services \(FRS\). We engaged with a range of stakeholders to implement PES to ensure the physical competence, health and safety of UK firefighters. The new procedures provide policy guidance to all 46 UK FRS, affecting approximately 44,000 operational firefighters, who attend approximately 725,000 incidents per year, while protecting the UK population. Our research developed valid and reliable tests and standards, fitness management processes and guidance documents. Implementation improved average cardiorespiratory fitness by 9.4% and reduced the proportion of firefighters failing their annual fitness assessments by 53%. An independent economic evaluation revealed an 88% reduction in lost duty days and a net saving of between GBP16,000,000 and GBP17,000,000 per annum for the sector. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The researchers who contributed to these impacts include three members of academic staff \(Professors Bilzon, Standage and Stokes, 2012\-Present\), and a post\-doctoral researcher \(Dr Siddall, 2012\-2016\), and the research was co\-developed with researchers from the FireFit Steering Group \(Stevenson and Turner\). The aim of this research was to identify and quantify physical demands of critical firefighting tasks, enabling the development of legally defensible physical employment standards \(PES\) for the UK Fire and Rescue Services \(FRS\). This is essential in ensuring that personnel possess the physical capabilities to perform their role safely and effectively, thereby enhancing operational performance and safety of employees and the public they serve. Prior to this, evidence for PES did not exist. 

 This series of projects has been supported by grants of approximately GBP225,000 from the Chief Fire Officer’s Association \(CFOA\) and the London Fire Brigade \(LFB\). As our research was funded directly by government agencies that have a stakeholder interest, the route to impact was immediate. The research activities are best captured under six sub\-headings, which map on to our primary research outputs \(RO\): 

 **i\) Task Analysis \(2012\):** We developed a robust approach to analyse and identify the most physically demanding operational tasks undertaken by UK firefighters and to determine minimum acceptable job performance. A novel process and guidance methodology were published, emphasising the need to engage a Technical Panel of subject\-matter experts and a Stakeholder Panel of senior staff, to ensure organisational ownership and engagement. Five generic firefighting task simulations were identified and endorsed **\[RO1\]**. 

 **ii\) Physical Demands Analysis \(2013\):** A representative sample of 62 UK firefighters completed these tasks and metabolic and cardiovascular strain were monitored throughout. Four tasks were endorsed as valid operational simulations by ≥90% of participants. Based on these demands, we determined that minimum cardiorespiratory fitness standards of 42.3 ml.kg<sup>−1</sup>.min<sup>−1</sup> and 36.8 ml.kg<sup>−1</sup>.min<sup>−1</sup> were commensurate with safe and efficient firefighting performance for operational firefighters and incident commanders, respectively **\[RO2\]**. 

 **iii\) Muscular Strength and Endurance \(2014\):** A further three criterion firefighting tasks, recognised to require significant upper body muscular strength and endurance. Fifty\-one volunteers performed the ladder handling tasks and three corresponding gym\-based surrogate tests. Analyses of test sensitivity and specificity of the surrogate tasks identified that a 35kg seated shoulder press, a 60kg rope pull\-down and 23 repetitions of a 28kg rope pull\-down represented minimum standards to ensure safe and effective performance **\[RO3\]**. 

 **iv\) Firefighting Simulation Test \(FFST\) \(2015\):** Based on criterion tasks, a FFST test was designed to provide simple means of assessing firefighter fitness. Data were obtained from 68 firefighters to reveal a high degree of validity and test\-retest reliability. Maximum test completion time of 11:11 mm:ss was commensurate with safe and efficient firefighting and associated with the cardiorespiratory fitness standard of 42.3 ml.kg<sup>−1</sup>.min<sup>−1</sup> **\[RO4\]**. 

 **v\) Fitness Management \(2017\):** Finally, we integrated tests and standards into a practical, efficient fitness management procedure, where individual risk could be managed based on level of certainty of operational fitness – using a traffic light principle. Developing procedures in this way ensured that tests and standards could be successfully incorporated into organisational policies and procedures, ensuring rapid knowledge translation and impact **\[RO5\]**. 

 **vi\)** **Health and Wellbeing \(2013\-2017\):* In 2013, a national survey was distributed and a sample of 4,564 FRS personnel responded. Subsequent analyses identified physical activity, sleep and smoking as independent determinants of wellbeing, obesity and chronic disease. Health and Fitness Advisors are using this evidence to implement personalised work\-place intervention strategies to enhance the health, fitness and wellbeing of personnel **\[RO6\]**. 

 In summary, we identified minimum acceptable performance on a range of critical and essential criterion firefighting tasks and, based on the demands of those tasks, identified surrogate physical employment tests and standards that accurately predict firefighting performance. We went further in developing an alternative field\-based assessment of operational fitness and developed a fitness management process and guidance documents to support implementation of an integrated approach.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 *“The partnership between the National Fire Chief’s Council, the FireFit Steering Group and the University of Bath has allowed us to develop, validate and implement evidence\-based physical employment standards across the UK Fire and Rescue Services. The work has transformed our focus on occupational fitness and has already increased the fitness standards of our operational firefighters, enhancing their health and the organisation’s ability to manage those who need to improve their physical capability for safe and effective long\-term employment”* Chair of the FireFit Steering Group \(FFSG\) **\[SE4\].** 

 Impact has been achieved nationally and internationally through: \(1\) introduction of national policy and guidance pertaining to annual fitness assessments of UK Fire and Rescue Services \(FRS\) personnel; \(2\) design, validation and implementation of service level fitness management processes and procedures; \(3\) delivery of educational symposia and online resources for health and fitness advisors and; \(4\) dissemination to national and international practitioner conferences and workshops. Beneficiaries include National Governing Bodies \(Chief Fire Officer’s Association, Government Joint Working Group\), International Governing Bodies \(e.g. Singapore Civil Defence Force\), the Fire Brigade’s Union, 46 UK Fire and Rescue Services, their health and fitness advisors, approximately 44,000 operational firefighters and the public they protect while attending approximately 725,000 incidents per year. 

 Based on research commenced by Bilzon and colleagues in 2012, minimum cardiorespiratory fitness standards were recommended for operational firefighters and supervisory incident commanders in 2016. These standards were immediately accepted and implemented. New policy and guidance for performing these tests was immediately communicated via the Chief Fire Officer’s Association \(CFOA\) website and in 2016, official national best practice guidance for all FRS was issued **\[SE1\]**. Shortly after this, Bilzon was invited to present the findings and recommendations to a Home Office National Joint Council \(NJC\) for Local Authority Fire and Rescue Services, who were producing a Firefighter Fitness Best Practice Guide **\[SE2\]**. Bilzon’s presentation is acknowledged throughout the report and, in particular, Section 3, where he produced national policy on fitness testing regimes **\[SE2\]**. 

 Between 2014 and 2015, further work was conducted to develop tests of muscular strength and endurance and validate the FireFighter Simulation Test \(FFST\). Our research recommendations were endorsed by the Chair of the FireFit Steering Group \(FFSG\) and the Stakeholder Panel. These research findings and recommendations were officially communicated to approximately 300 senior delegates during a Special Symposium at the 2016 FireFit Annual Conference **\[SE3\]**. Importantly, this marked the first occasion that the Fire Brigades Union had publicly endorsed our research and associated recommendations **\[SE4\].** 

 Professor Bilzon received an ‘outstanding partnership’ award from the Chair of the FFSG. We published our final report and recommendations, together with a proposed fitness management process **\[SE5\]**. This was followed by a range of media events, including interviews with the BBC Points West and BBC Radio Bristol **\[SE6\]**, ensuring that the wider UK public were aware of the new tests and standards. 

 It became apparent that CFOA needed to consider the consistency between the new annual fitness assessments and the National Firefighter Selection Tests \(NFST\) previously implemented across the UK. The FFSG Chair commissioned Bath to meet with the authors of NFST report and draft a short consultancy document, providing specific recommendations necessary to integrate the two processes. In light of our research, changes were made to the NFST in 2017 to incorporate our strength tests and changes made to the guidance to new applicants to inform them on how best to prepare for the NFST and beyond **\[SE7\].** 

 The London Fire Brigade \(LFB\) confirmed that they perform a number of firefighting tasks differently, primarily due to the nature of urban firefighting. Following the same methodology and principles, we were able to collect new data with LFB in September 2017 and make specific recommendations for urban firefighters, including a modified cardiorespiratory fitness standard and FFST assessment. These recommendations have been fully implemented and acknowledged **\[SE4\]**: 

 *“we thank you for your flexibility in…the development of an alternative FFST for urban firefighting, including the London Fire Brigade”.* 

 In 2019, an independent survey was conducted by the FFSG to assess the impact of the national guidance since the previous survey in 2011 **\[SE8\]**. The percentage of FRS adopting the recommended minimum fitness standards had increased from 76% to 95%. This was corroborated from the survey of fitness advisor opinions which identified that 95% of FRS had changed their fitness policy to reflect the new standards and procedures, indicating high uptake of the new policy **\[SE8\]**. Additionally, the proportion of FRS proactively removing firefighters with a substandard level of physical fitness increased from 62% to 95%, enhancing the safety of all concerned. Importantly, 81% of fitness advisers felt that the new CFOA guidance had improved how firefighters with low levels of physical fitness were being managed **\[SE8\]**. 

 Latest fitness data demonstrate that the average cardiorespiratory fitness of UK firefighters has improved from 46.3 ml.kg<sup>\-1</sup>.min<sup>\-1</sup> to 49.3 ml.kg<sup>\-1</sup>.min<sup>\-1</sup> \(9.4%\) since implementation. Over 68% of fitness advisers also felt that the standards had increased the levels of physical fitness in their service **\[SE8\]**. The improvement in physical fitness has reduced the proportion of firefighters failing the fitness assessment by 53%. Consequently, the number of lost duty days due to ‘capability’ has decreased by 88%, leading to a net national saving for the sector of between GBP16,000,000 and GBP17,000,000 per annum, as evidenced  by an independent economic evaluation **\[SE9\]**. The Fire Fighters Charity has also confirmed the use of the new standards in the rehabilitation of injured personnel **\[SE10\]**: 

 *“…we use the standards as part of an assessment and fitness development for those seeking to return to operational duties”.*

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Michael Berkowitz’s research demonstrates the importance of Jewish lives to the histories of creative economies, particularly the integral parts played by migrants and refugees during the first half of the twentieth century to photography, music and theatre. This research has led to the co\-development of two stage productions – a revival of Kurt Weill’s opera *The Tsar Wants His Photograph Taken* and a new musical, *Man & God* – which have stimulated new interpretations, new works, and new trajectories for creative practitioners \(including directors, musicians, and singers\). In addition, Berkowitz has shaped theatre performances, recitals, popular exhibitions, public talks, and related media coverage that have enhanced cultural comprehension of Jewish vocations and identities. He has enabled cultural institutions such as the Wiener Holocaust Library and the Lithuanian Embassy to stimulate public engagement with significant historical and cultural issues. His expertise in historically informed performances shaped and significantly influenced the staging of the critically acclaimed National Theatre play *The Lehman Trilogy* \(total audience c.150,000\).

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prof. Michael Berkowitz’s research showed how a better understanding of photography as a predominantly Jewish space in Europe \(until the Second World War\) helps us to comprehend the worlds that Jews and non\-Jews made together, and appreciate the breadth of Jewish vocations and identities across the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, particularly those lost during the Holocaust. His research extended beyond Britain to other parts of the world, such as Lithuania, and also encompasses the importance of Jewish lives within the histories of music and motion pictures, to demonstrate how integrating the stories of Jewish pathbreakers radically alters the usual historical narratives underpinning these creative fields. 

 While ‘Jewish contributions’ to society, generally and in the realm of entertainment for the masses, are widely acknowledged, little attention has been paid to the important roles of Jewish women and men in the photography industry. Berkowitz’s research has shown that from the 1850s to the 1950s, photography was one of the most open avenues for Jews to make a living in Britain, as well as contribute to mainstream culture. Berkowitz’s 2015 book, *Jews and Photography in Britain* \[ **R1**\], was the first historical investigation of this topic, showing how in addition to bringing new photographic ideas and methods to Britain, Jews imagined entirely new forms of creative expression. Important examples include sophisticated political and news coverage by Stefan Lorant that also incorporated biting satire through photography, and the emergence of photographs of architecture and artworks as works of art in themselves by Helmut Gernsheim. Jewish men and women were crucial to the growth of both studio and press photography in Britain, advancing these sectors economically and creatively as well as facilitating the integration of the Jewish community into British society. Berkowitz’s book chapter, *Émigré photographers* \[ **R2**\], further emphasises the importance to the British photographic scene of Jewish and political refugees who had fled Nazi persecution. Berkowitz explained that these émigré photographers and other significant figures – such as Gernsheim, who was also a foundational historian of photography – spurred new developments in the UK, such as the integration of photography into institutions such as the Royal Academy and the V&A, and the application of photography to the study of the fine arts \(exemplified though the work of the Warburg Institute\). 

 In *Photography as Jewish space* \[ **R3**\], Berkowitz demonstrated how, particularly prior to the Second World War, photography was a disproportionately Jewish economic and creative realm in Central Europe, as well as Britain. Photography was a vital network that cut across generational and national lines and was crucial to intra\-Jewish relationships and those with non\-Jews. It was a diverse and expansive space that encompassed men and women who were prominent photographers and editors, as well as individuals who owned and staffed photographic laboratories and equipment stores. However, photography was not deemed a respectable vocation during this period and so leading figures’ participation has been obscured and marginalized. Berkowitz used the example of Lithuania, where approximately 95% of the Jewish population was murdered, to show how researching the photography industry assists in the reconstruction and interpretation of Jewish daily life prior to the Holocaust. 

 Berkowitz’s catalogue foreword for the Wiener Holocaust Library’s 2019 exhibition *Berlin\-London: The Lost Photographs of Gerty Simon* \[ **R4**\] identified, for the first time, that Simon was one of the inspirations for the character of the strong, articulate and highly competent Jewish woman photographer who runs her own studio in *The Tsar Wants His Photograph Taken*, a comic opera by Kurt Weill and Georg Kaiser \(1928\) suppressed upon the Nazis taking power in 1933. His essay *Kodachrome’s \(rather\) Jewish musical history* \[ **R5**\] introduces how the invention of the Kodachrome film process in 1935 was inextricably tied to developments in classical and jazz music – and interwoven into Jewish history. Kodachrome’s main creators, Leopold Mannes and Leopold Godowsky, Jr, were classical musicians and related to the Gershwins and Damrosches \(founders of the New York Philharmonic\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Berkowitz’s research into the importance of Jewish lives within the histories of photography, music and theatre led to the co\-development of two stage productions, stimulating new interpretations, works, and trajectories for creative practitioners \(including directors, musicians, and singers\). Operatic and theatrical performances, including his role in the innovative staging of the critically acclaimed National Theatre production of *The Lehman Trilogy*, as well as recitals, exhibitions, public talks, and related media coverage have drawn on Berkowitz’s research and thereby enhanced cultural comprehension of Jewish vocations and identities. These activities have challenged established norms and modes of thought in understanding how performance and visual culture can stimulate engagement with historical and cultural issues for cultural institutions such as the Wiener Holocaust Library and the Lithuanian embassy. 

 **Influencing and enhancing creative practice through co\-production** 

 Building on his research into Jewish photographers \[ **R2**, **R5**\], Berkowitz produced three stagings of the comic opera, *The Tsar Wants His Photograph Taken* by Kurt Weill and Georg Kaiser \(1928\), with a total audience of 570. Through his sustained collaboration with director Leo Doulton, Berkowitz has demonstrated that history can be better understood through creative practitioners reviving and explaining creative work that germinated and was received in the context of ethnic difference, with distinct ideas emerging in each one. This learning process benefitted performers, audiences and cultural institutions alike. Berkowitz’s research into the Jewish engagement with photographic technology and science, specifically the link between Kodachrome and Jewish musical history \[ **R5**\], served as the main basis for a new musical, *Man & God*. Written by Doulton and composed by Jacob Dorfman, it was performed as a work\-in\-progress in York, Leeds, and London in 2019 to a total audience of 140. It communicates the relationship between evolving forms of musical interpretation and the science of colour photography, specifically regarding the invention and history of the Kodachrome colour film process. 

 The performances of both the opera and musical involved 52 performers and creative practitioners in total, broadening their musical experience and fruitfully developing their professional practice. Doulton’s directorial practice, in particular, has been enhanced by working closely with Berkowitz, calling it “ **a really rewarding creative partnership**” that has “ **influenced me a lot, particularly in terms of how rigorous I am in researching productions, and going to primary sources rather than other people’s interpretations of them**” \( **A**\). Performers expressed how “ **the academic research made the musical really engage with the complexity of history**” and drawing upon Berkowitz’s expertise made the production **“feel like a real luxury and rare opportunity**” \( **A**\). Cast members also noted that the academic component enhanced creative practice by refining and deepening performers’ understanding of the historical nuances and significance of the opera, as well as their comprehension of links between the political context and the creative decisions \( **A**\). 

 **Increasing understanding and prominence of cultural traditions and community histories** 

 The performances of *The Tsar* with related discussion of Weill’s opera and its themes at the Bloomsbury Theatre Studio \(audience 97, February 2016\), Bloomsbury Theatre Main Stage \(audience 394, May 2019\), and the Wiener Holocaust Library \(audience 40, September 2019\) were either sell\-outs or close to capacity \( **B**, **C**\). These London shows engaged performers and audiences with the possibilities for live performance to animate research and show that university\-based research can inspire new artistic projects. Audience responses demonstrated how staging rarely\-seen work fostered cultural understanding. Performing and discussing lesser\-known historical matters, according to one surveyed audience member, meant “ **nothing but learning and enjoying**.” 57% of the audience that provided feedback at the Bloomsbury Theatre attested that they learned about the significance of Jewish women as photographers about which they were previously unaware \( **D**\). The audience response to the performance of *Man & God* in London emphasised how Berkowitz’s on\-stage introduction \(that drew upon \[ **R5**\]\) heightened cultural comprehension: it **“enhanced the experience for a deeper understanding”**; it **“was a fun way to learn about”** the historical figures and “ **informative**”; “ **the talk beforehand was great in setting the scene**” \( **E**\). 

 Media coverage demonstrated how both productions informed a wider public about these obscured aspects of European culture. A substantial 2019 article in the *Guardian* \(multiplatform readership 6,076,000\) identified how the revival of *The* *Tsar* “ **marks a significant act of defiance against the Nazis, even eight decades after the once popular comic opera was pulled from the German repertoire by the authorities**”, demonstrating new awareness of what the crusade against so\-called ‘degenerate’ Jewish influence entailed \(on p3 of **F**\). A review in *Opera* \(the world’s leading opera magazine, monthly circulation 40–50,000\) introduced *The* *Tsar* to a more specialist audience, observing that on the basis of the Bloomsbury Theatre performance **“Weill’s intricate, ambitious little grotesque certainly merits more regular exposure**” \(on p10 of **F**\). Both articulated genuine enthusiasm for further staging of Weill’s work. A review of *Man & God* on theatrical website *The Upcoming* emphasised the staging’s success in enhancing cultural understanding: “ **the story they seek to tell is an important one, and they give voice to an aspect of history that has been horrendously overlooked**” \( **G**\). 

 **Supporting and enhancing critically acclaimed creative endeavour** 

 Berkowitz’s expertise in narrating and interpreting Jewish culture from the 19th\-century to the present, as evidenced by \[ **R1**\], and experience of staging historically informed performances, led to him shaping the radical staging of the Sam Mendes/Ben Powers’ production of *The Lehman Trilogy* for the National Theatre. The play, an epic that spans the Lehman family history from their arrival in New York from Bavaria in 1844 to their firm’s collapse during the 2008 financial crash, drew audiences in London \(April—October 2018 and May—August 2019\) and New York \(March—April 2019\) of at least 150,000. Through a pre\-rehearsal consultancy, Berkowitz advised that the play was such a departure from the known history that Mendes and Powers should make no pretence to historicity and not attempt ‘historical’ staging. As acknowledged by the National Theatre, his “expertise in the cultural, social, and religious traditions of the Jewish community” \[…\] especially “ **influenced the play’s ultimate ‘timeless’ setting” \(as opposed to the conventional, historical stage set and props as indicated in the initial script\) and “was incorporated into the final staging of the play**” \( **H**\). Reviewers ardently praised this decision, including Ben Brantley, the leading theatre critic for the *New York Times* \(March 2019, daily circulation 571,500\): “the audience are \[not\] likely to forget what they’ve seen. The real magic of “The Lehman Trilogy” has nothing to do with numbers. It’s the miracle of three men, on a nearly naked stage, resurrecting vanished lives and worlds, leaving an oddly indelible afterglow in the final fade into darkness” \( **I,** on p3\). 

 **Collaborating with institutions to enhance communication and engagement** 

 Berkowitz has collaborated with curators and archivists at the Wiener Holocaust Library, one of the world's leading and most extensive archives on the Nazi era, to help them achieve their mission of engaging people of all ages and backgrounds to enhance understanding of the Holocaust and its historical context. The Wiener Holocaust Library hosted an exhibition \(30 May—15 October 2019\), *Berlin\-London: The Lost Photographs of Gerty Simon*, which featured a set of recently acquired images not seen in public for over eighty years and brought their significance to light. Berkowitz served as a key consultant for the exhibition, wrote the Foreword for the exhibition catalogue \[ **R4**\], and gave a public talk on Simon and other Jewish women photographers, throughout drawing upon his expertise to, as the Curator put it, “ **guide us upon the significance of the collection, and to help us to understand Gerty Simon’s status as a photographer**” \( **C**\). Sales of the catalogue were higher than average; the first print run sold out and another was printed; 198 were sold in total. The exhibition was the Library’s second most popular to date, attracting 3,300 visitors \(two thirds of the visitors who attended exhibitions there in 2019\). A further 610 people visited for events connected with the exhibition. 

 An abridged staging of *The* *Tsar* in the exhibition space realized the Library’s goal of using their archival materials as a living memorial that works in service of the future. Warnock attests that the sold\-out event was an “ **unusually entertaining and compelling way of illustrating a life such as Gerty Simon’s** \[that\] **revealed some of the connections \[Berkowitz\] had discovered between Gerty Simon, who was possibly a model for one of the characters in the opera, and Kurt Weill and \(singer\) Lotte Lenya**”, as sitters for Gerty Simon, and made “ **a significant contribution to the **Berlin\-London** events series**” \( **C**\). The audience reported that they learned about an outstanding artist, about whom they were previously unaware, and about the larger, important cohort of Jews as photographers: “ **the production and my experience of it was enriched by the presentation of historical context**”, and “ **I would like to take a fresh look at Weill’s music**” \( **D**\). Prior to this, Berkowitz’s research informed the development of the Wiener exhibition *Fragments of a Lost Homeland: Remembering the Armenian Genocide* \(8 October 2015—24 March 2016\) and contributed to the associated events programme, which enabled archivists to more clearly communicate photography’s “profound implications for the memory of genocide” for both Armenian and Jewish communities \( **C**\). 

 Berkowitz’s research led to long\-term collaboration with the Lithuanian Embassy \(London\), including concerts and recitals as part of the annual *Litvak Days* events programme \(December 2013—May 2020\). These events that celebrated and explored the culture and memory of the Lithuanian Jewish \(‘Litvak’\) community were informed by Berkowitz’s research, for example \[ **R3**\], and each attract audiences of between 60 and 200. The ambassador of the Republic of Lithuania to the UK observed that Berkowitz’s “ **knowledge and insights into key cultural figures helped underpin the success of these events**” \( **J**\). The regular events series, co\-curated by Berkowitz, explore how Lithuania’s almost entirely lost Jewish community and Litvak diaspora continue to stimulate and inform contemporary Lithuanian culture. According to the embassy, the “ **programme enabled attendees to better understand the past as well as appreciate contemporary incarnations of Litvak culture**” \( **J**\). The success of these events “ **has led to an increase in embassy investment into this and other cultural programmes**”, such as a 2018 concert and CD by Aerogram of Litvak music, and a commitment to the Litvak Days as a permanent regular fixture of the embassy’s activity \( **J**\). The ambassador describes how “ **Berkowitz’s contributions have therefore supported and extended the Lithuanian government’s commitment to preserving the culture and memory of Jewish people, specifically through ensuring historical justice, undermining antisemitism, and promoting research into and preservation of Jewish culture and heritage**” \( **J**\)

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Patient care is most greatly influenced by clinical research, whose accuracy is determined by the quality of measurement and analyses. Hobart’s expertise in Patient Reported Outcome \(PRO\) measurement and analysis directly influenced FDA policy and, through use in commercial and academic clinical trials, created patient and commercial benefits.   Global pharmaceutical companies use Hobart’s PROs in clinical trials of, and/or labelling claims for, new treatments.  These treatments have benefited over one million patients worldwide and generated £80 Billion commercial income.  Hobart’s collaboration with the global initiative, Brain Health Matters in Multiple Sclerosis, has improved clinical services and patient knowledge and resulted in patients playing a proactive part in managing their own disease.

### 1.  Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This case study is underpinned by research into Patient Reported Outcomes \(PROs\), especially for Multiple Sclerosis \(MS\), and the development of international consensus guidelines for MS care. 

 **Research into the development and analysis of PROs** 

 PROs measure how people feel and function, determining disease impact and treatment efficacy in clinical trials and practice. Consequently, they are central dependent variables guiding people’s treatments and public expenditure. 

 Following publications reporting on empirical examinations of widely used PROs, Hobart explained why many instruments used in clinical trials were not fit for purpose \[3.1\].  In response to calls from healthcare researchers for accessible accounts of new psychometric methods, the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment funded Hobart to study the advantages of applying advanced level measurement science to PROs. This advanced Hobart’s skills for developing “well\-defined and reliable” PROs and led to revisions of his MS PROs \[3.2\].  The work highlighted the importance of ensuring clinical trial PROs are developed, and evaluated, using appropriate methods. Hobart developed particular expertise in Rasch Measurement Theory \(RMT\), a hypothesis\-testing analytical statistical tool, to guide PRO development and evaluation by identifying limitations and highlighting areas for refinement \[3.3\]. 

 An exemplar of measurement advances associated with Hobart’s work was the ENHANCE global clinical trial which used a Hobart PRO as a primary outcome measure \[3.4\]. This was the first study to use an *a priori* determined meaningful change estimate of a PRO as its primary endpoint.  Hobart also evaluated existing PROs’ strengths and weaknesses, and their ability to meet FDA requirements.  This analysis has utilised a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, including RMT, to assess whether the developmental approach meets best practice and the reliability of data generated.  The underpinning research and capability demonstrated within these projects has created opportunities for further impact in PRO analyses within clinical trials. 

 Hobart has worked commercially with LORA group LLC in the U.S to develop new PROs for dermatology \(primary axillary hyperhidrosis, Brickell Biotech\) \[3.5\], haematology \(sickle cell disease, Global Blood Therapeutics\) and urology \(prostatic hypertrophy, Vantia\).  These projects, which demonstrate the near ubiquitous applicability and value of these methods, have further advanced methods for developing PROs as fit\-for\-purpose measures of well\-defined constructs in specific clinical contexts. 

 **Advancing Care in MS through Research** 

 Hobart is a founder member of the Brain Health Initiative \(BHI\), which aims to maximise the brain health of people with MS. The initiative has been endorsed by over 50 international groups and its outputs are frequently used by clinicians, industry, charities and patients to influence clinical practice and services. In 2018, the BHI published an internationally applicable policy statement report on MS care. Subsequently, Hobart led the development of the first international consensus guidelines for MS care articulating the core message, “time matters in MS”, in a clinically applicable format.  The work involved a panel of international specialist MS neurologists participating in an iterative, online, modified Delphi process to define ‘core’, ‘achievable’ and ‘aspirational’ time frames reflecting minimum, good and high care standards, respectively. In a second step, a multidisciplinary Reviewing Group \(MS nurses, people with MS, allied healthcare professionals\) provided insights, ensuring that recommendations reflected perspectives from multiple stakeholders.  The third step was the development of a clinical audit tool.  This has been deployed in MS centres in 14 countries with Hobart as the clinical lead for audit \[3.6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Success in basic science rarely leads to effective treatments, as those that are shown to work in controlled laboratory conditions can be worthless when studied in human beings. Hobart demonstrated that many of the PROs used to test the efficacy of treatments in controlled conditions were not fit for purpose and consequently hindered advances in basic science. His research has increased the chances of reaching the correct conclusions about the effectiveness of treatments, which influence decisions on patient care and guide future research. 

 **PROs supporting treatment developments, licensing approvals and clinical adoption** 

 Hobart’s research influenced FDA \(U.S Food and Drug Administration\) policy \(last REF period\).  which created an increased focus from regulatory bodies on the quality of clinical outcome measures within licensing decisions.  Hobart’s PROs are referenced in the FDA compendium of clinical outcome assessments, which endorsed their global position as Gold Standard measures. Consequently, they have been deployed in clinical research of MS treatments in over 85 countries \[5.1\]. 

 Between 1 August 2013 and 30 November 2020, five Hobart PROs have been licensed a total of 136 times including with global pharmaceuticals such as Roche, Merck, Sanofi, Novartis and Biogen \[5.1\].  The importance of the PROs informing clinical research and licensing decisions is reflected by the price companies are willing to pay, with charges up to £32,000 per clinical trial license and total fees in this period of over £1.26M \[5.1\].  Many of the trials have been of Disease Modifying Therapies which are now core treatments; particularly in MS, an incurable chronic disease currently affecting 2.3 million people worldwide. Since 1 August 2013, Hobart’s PROs have been directly involved in the clinical trials of 36 treatments, mostly in MS but also in other areas \[5.1\].  The global sales value of 11 of the most widely adopted MS treatments \(using just the figures available between 2013 and 2020\) equates to £80 Billion \[5.2\]. Moreover, we have evidence that they have reached over one million patients \[5.2\]. Novartis MS Global Brand Medical Directors Thomas Hach and Dee Stoneman stated that *‘The scales were used because of their scientific value and recognition in the clinical and regulatory community. The evidence generated from these studies help to inform clinical opinion and ultimately allow eligible patients to benefit from these treatments… \[this demonstrates\] the significant impact and value of the work Professor Hobart and his team at the University of Plymouth have in the area of MS research through the development and licensing of high quality Patient Reported Outcome Measures’* \[5.3\] 

  

 For example, the MS medicines Lemtrada \(alemtuzumab\) and Aubagio \(teriflunomide\) demonstrate the financial value of Hobart PROs in supporting licensing and clinical adoption.  Hobart PROs played a key role in developing the evidence of the clinical benefits of these medications. Lemtrada secured market authorisation in Europe on 12/09/2013 and Aubagio on 26/08/2013.  Data supplied by Sanofi highlights both the patient and commercial impact of these medicines: 

-  Lemtrada \[text removed for publication\]. 

-  Aubagio \[text removed for publication\]. 

 *‘The data \[above\] is from the Sanofi annual investor report which outlines both the patient and commercial impact of these medicines… \[this\] demonstrates the… value of the work \[of\] Professor Hobart.’* Dr Eddie Guzdar, Head of Medical Affairs for the Neurology Franchise at Sanofi Genzyme UK and Ireland \[5.4\] 

  

 Similarly, Biogen have used Hobart’s PROs in the clinical trials of fampridine prolonged release \(Fampyra\) to evaluate the effect on improvement of walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis with walking disability. Up to April 2020, this medicine has been used in over 50 countries and has treated 386,528 people treated worldwide \[5.5\]. In addition, Hobart’s PROs were used in clinical phase 4 trials of Ocrelizumab to treat relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis. Paul Byrne, Life\-cycle leader Ocrevus and James Overell, Principal Global Medical Director, Neuroscience at Roche said that *‘The data… is linked to increased clinical recognition of the benefit of Ocrelizumab, especially in early MS disease and in targeting progression which is the cause of long\-term disability…  The rigorous scientific development of the Hobart PROs gives us and the community confidence that we are measuring what is clinically important.’* \[5.6\] 

 **Advising global companies on measurement strategies and data analysis for clinical trials** 

 Hobart’s specialist knowledge and skills in health measurement have been used to support global companies with measurement strategies and data analysis.  These have informed the companies’ decision making as they develop, trial and seek to license new treatments.  For example, Since 2019, Hobarts guidance to Roche shaped measurement strategies in four clinical studies in MS. \[text removed for publication\].  *‘Professor Hobarts expertise has been important to us as a company in informing our measurement strategies in relation to Patient Reported Outcome Measures… These clinical studies are key components in assessing the safety and efficacy of our companies \[sic\] treatments in MS…  It is anticipated this will improve the quality of clinical research and support the development, evidence and adoption of high\-quality treatments that will ultimately improve outcomes for people with MS.’*  Licinio Craveiro, Senior Global Medical Director, Roche.\[5.7\] 

 In addition to licensing the PROs within clinical trials, Professor Hobart collaborates with Novartis in the analysis of PRO data and strategic projects focussed on the improvement/development of PROs. He has been contracted in projects seeking to further analyse the PRO data from clinical studies, which have a combined total of over 3500 participants, to maximise the value of interpretations.  He was engaged by Novartis to be co\-chair of their global Patient Relevant Outcomes Steering Committee in Multiple Sclerosis \(PROMPT\-MS\). This strategic forum seeks to empower people living with MS to communicate relevant outcomes to healthcare practitioners in order to enable shared decision\-making and ultimately improve clinical outcomes of MS. These contracts, worth £141,000, demonstrate Hobart’s position as a global leader \[5.3\]. 

 **Advancing Care in Multiple Sclerosis \(MS\)** 

 Time to a diagnosis of MS is often protracted, delaying access to specialist healthcare advice and treatment initiation which results in physical and cognitive decline, fatigue and reduced quality of life. Hobart worked alongside MS specialist neurologists to develop internationally applicable quality standards for timely, brain health focused MS care \[5.9\]. These became a key component of the Brain Health Matters in MS initiative, which has been endorsed by over 50 influential groups in MS care with champions in 55 countries. 

 The Brain Health Time Matters project team evaluated the success of this initiative through a survey which received 100 responses from 20 countries across four continents. Due to the MS Brain Health initiative recommendations and consensus standards, 84% of respondents said that they had made changes in their practice, services and/or management of MS. The recommendations and consensus standards had: 

-  In the case of health care organisation, changed their practices or services. 

-  In the case of people with MS or their carers, influenced how they managed their MS or the MS of the person they cared for, or 

-  In the case of respondents from commercial or patient support organisations, influenced how they, or their company, supported the MS community. 

 Of respondents from Health Care Organisations, 75% identified improvements in information given to people living with MS, whilst 65% felt the initiative had improved their knowledge of preserving brain heath.  People with MS who responded to the survey noted multiple benefits.  80% identified that they had improved their knowledge of preserving brain health in MS and over 50% felt that as a result of the initiative they had taken a more proactive part in managing their own disease \[5.9\].   Case studies highlighting Global Impact on the MS Brain Health time matters website in seven countries include a doubling of treatments used for people with MS in Serbia and a parliamentary debate agreeing to increase funding for MS research in Australia \[5.10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In England alone, 370,000 people have a rare genetic syndrome that causes intellectual disability. This is a neglected population at high risk of behavioural and emotional disorder. Aston\-led research has analysed profiles of behaviour in multiple rare genetic syndromes and applied the results to develop FIND \(<ins> **F**</ins>urther <ins> **I**</ins>nform <ins> **N**</ins>eurogenetic <ins> **D**</ins>isorders\), the first online, *accessible* resource to inform multiple stakeholders of behavioural and emotional consequences resulting from specific, rare genetic syndromes. In collaboration with support groups, FIND has significantly influenced awareness, understanding and the behaviour of parents, clinicians and educators internationally. 

 Impacts on **Understanding, Learning & Participation**, **Health & Wellbeing** and **Practitioners & Delivery of Professional Services** are claimed. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background:** The White Paper ‘Together for health: a strategic approach for the EU 2008\-2013’ and subsequent ‘Recommendation on an action in the field of rare diseases’ identified rare conditions as an international priority. The need for specific advice regarding behavioural profiles of genetic syndromes remains substantial. Prior research indicated that families regularly seek information tailored to their child’s syndrome, but the lack of evidenced\-based guidance leaves families with extreme uncertainty and places children at high risk of persistent and severe behavioural disorder. Behavioural disorder includes self\-injurious behaviour \(e.g. head\-banging, eye gouging\), aggression, rigid repetitive behaviours and life\-impairing anxiety. 

 Behavioural disorder is a serious source of psychological distress; particularly when families are unable to understand what is happening to their loved one. A substantial proportion of parents reach cut\-off for clinically significant anxiety \(> 50%\) and depression \(> 30%\). NICE guidance also emphasises how behavioural disorder impacts the person displaying that behaviour, by elevating the likelihood of children being taken into care, placement breakdown and restrictive and abusive practices. The average cost of an annual placement for someone showing behaviour disorder is £200,000. 

 **Underpinning research:** Waite’s Aston\-based research has elucidated the syndrome\-specific behavioural profiles of eight of the ten rare genetic syndromes featured in FIND. Research into each of these syndromes was performed in collaboration with support charities \(e.g. **S3.1\-3.2, S3.4 & S3.6**\). Updates to current knowledge regarding Cornelia de Lange \( **S3.4**\), Lowe, Prader\-Willi, fragile\-X and Williams syndromes have resulted from Aston\-based research that cuts across groups \( **S3.1, S3.2\-3.3, S3.5**\). Further research into Rubinstein\-Taybi \( **S3.6**\), Kleefstra, Angelman and Bardet\-Biedl syndromes is ongoing in current programmes \( **S3, research grants**\). 

 **Research insights/findings:** Underpinning research has determined that particular genetic syndromes are at *far* *greater risk* than other syndromes of specific types for behaviour disorder and has identified causal mechanisms leading to these differences \( **S3.1\-S3.6**\). This includes new insights into adaptive behaviour difficulties, severe temper\-outbursts, self\-injurious behaviour, aggressive behaviour, repetitive behaviours, anxiety, mood related difficulties and health/sensory difficulties across syndromes. For example, people with Williams syndrome are four times more likely to experience persistent life\-limiting anxiety than people in the general population, and this is now known to be associated with underlying sensory processing problems in this syndrome \( **S3.1, S3.5**\). 

 Aston\-based research also cuts across syndromes and disorders. For example, research examining mechanisms of temper outbursts in Lowe syndrome has indicated similar mechanisms as in Prader\-Willi syndrome \( **S3.2**\), so highlighting the importance of raising awareness of findings across groups \(e.g. **S3.3**\), as well as within those groups. 

 **Key Contextual Information:** There is currently a lag of \~10 years between scientific publication in the field of psychology and subsequent changes to clinical practice. To address this gap, there is an urgent need for accessible summaries of research findings, training aids and resources to be made available to parents for advocacy purposes. These resources are also needed for clinicians, to accelerate the application of new knowledge in clinical settings; particularly in relation to rare and neglected groups.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 While a postdoc at the University of Birmingham \(2014\-2017, PI Prof. Chris Oliver\), Waite established a new online resource, FIND \(<ins> **F**</ins>urther <ins> **I**</ins>nform <ins> **N**</ins>eurogenetic <ins> **D**</ins>isorders\).  As an Aston academic, Waite now leads FIND which is still hosted at UoB, through an Aston/UoB collaboration. Impacts described herein are restricted to those from September 2017 onwards \(i.e. Waite’s Aston\-based research; **S5.1**\). 

 FIND now details ten rare genetic syndromes \( **S5.2**\). Four of these: Rubinstein\-Taybi \(RTS\), Lowe, Kleefstra and Williams syndromes were developed by Waite’s group at Aston, following research in collaboration with support charities \( **S3.1, S3.2, S3.6**\). An additional four syndromes: Angelman, Cornelia de Lange, Fragile X and Prader\-Willi, have been renewed/updated by Waite since 2019, based on her cross\-syndrome research \( **S3.1\-3.4**\). 

 From translation of Waite’s Aston research into accessible summaries, videos, assessment manuals and training aids \(delivered via the FIND website\) the following impacts on patients, their families and on practitioners are claimed: 

 **Impact on understanding, learning and participation:** In 2018, 87% of 104 surveyed users said they would re\-visit FIND. In 2020, following Waite’s updates of 2019, online feedback from 350 users revealed that 90% strongly\-agreed/agreed that FIND improved their knowledge; 88% would recommend FIND to others and 91% found FIND easy to understand. Google Analytics show that FIND accumulates > 100K new web sessions per year. These are significant numbers, given the scarcity of the rare disorders addressed. FIND has global traction with key audiences comprising the United States \(42%\), the UK \(24%\), Australia \(6%\), Canada \(6%\) and India \(2%\) \( **S5.3**\). Qualitative feedback \( **S5.4**\) also illustrates impact e.g. *“*I am a parent of a 13 year\-old girl and I am also a learning disability nurse…the website has provided the most informative and accurate information I have ever read.”; “Mother of a 9 year old. We live in the U.S. love the info here.”; “I'm in Japan but not enough information of PWS found in JPN website” \(parent\); “My daughter goes through bouts of aggression and I now know this is actually part of the syndrome” and “I'm a leader of the dutch CdLS group, can use this to help our families”. Within the UK, support groups circulate FIND via their mailing lists and estimate that between 20% and 90% of all UK families affected \(according to syndrome\) have been reached \( **S5.5**\). 

 Six RTS videos that Waite developed with RTS\-UK detail RTS characteristics and recommendations for behaviour management \( **S5.6**\) and have already accumulated >2000 views via FIND \( **S5.3**\). Qualitative feedback demonstrates their transformative impact e.g. *“*The syndrome is so rare that most of the info online is about the actual presentation and diagnosis. It was great to see the pictures/videos of others with RTS and realize that some behaviours are fairly characteristic and syndrome related. I hope to share this web\-site and videos with behaviour therapists and his \(special needs\) school teachers *”* \(Canadian family, **S5.4** *\).* 

 **Impact on Health and Wellbeing:** Aston researchers have given invited presentations of FIND resources at 5 syndrome\-support conferences, leading to parent empowerment e.g. *“*They inspired me to come home and make a bigger fuss to get to the bottom of why \[son\] was biting himself and lashing out….– they were right, \[son\] had a stomach ulcer\! *”* and from another family: *“*Information \[Waite\] sent to me was vital helping the authorities understand her needs and constant vulnerability for \[daughter’s\] Personal Independent Plan assessment, and \[during\] a very distressing court case, the district Judge in particular took time to read it, and made good reference to it, resulting in onward support and counselling for \[daughter\]” *\(* **S5.7**\). Meanwhile, qualitative feedback from the website demonstrates similar influence e.g. “My state/country U.S. are cutting services for the disabled and this information is going to be so helpful in keeping the services which he presently has” \(parent; **S5.4**\). 

 **Impact on Practitioners and the Delivery of Professional Services:** Qualitatively, teachers have found the FIND website helpful e.g. “sections allow us to become quickly conversant with the syndrome.  The photos and videos were particularly helpful. Truly a lifesaver… for a number of us” and “I am from Australia and these resources will be used throughout my service” \(disability support provider\) \( **S5.4**\). FIND is also cited in a core text and in course reading lists for trainee clinical psychologists \( **S5.8**\) and FIND training for these professionals has had tangible real\-world benefits: e.g. “Having this increased understanding meant the family were, as a unit, more willing to engage with me in implementing a programme to reduce \[client’s\] repetitive behaviour *”* and *“*this training has made a massive difference. I feel more confident re behavioural assessments and phenotypes and will now explore the possible impacts of genetic syndromes more readily during behavioural assessments *”* \( **S5.9**\). 

 In Dec\-2019, a manual of 12 research questionnaires \( **S5.10**\), co\-authored by Aston and Birmingham, was launched through FIND. The manual has already accumulated 618 downloads representing represent 37 countries, 104 NHS Trusts/organisations, 23 international hospitals/healthcare organisations, 17 government bodies and councils, 10 charities and 7 schools. 

 **In summary**, FIND addresses the 10\-year lag between research and implementation by providing parents, clinicians and educators worldwide with urgently\-required, up\-to\-date and importantly, *accessible* information and guidance about rare neurogenetic disorders.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Internationally leading Open University research on local health\-related manufacturing in Africa and its implications for inclusive health care has had wide impacts on national, multilateral and philanthropic policy and professional practice by the following categories of stakeholder, with type of impact: 

-  *Local health sector manufacturers and manufacturing associations*: provision of evidence to strengthen their arguments for policy support for manufacturing development in East Africa; 

-  *East African health and industrial policy makers*: evidence cited, from project policy briefs, to support pharmaceutical manufacturing policy in the Tanzanian *Second Five\-Year Development Plan* \(2016\), and Tanzanian Ministerial interventions at East African Community \(EAC\) level; 

-  UN bodies: UNIDO, UNCTAD, Unitaid and WHO: policy influence through UN consultancies, invitations to present evidence for policy, expert evidence for UNIDO manufacturing consultations and policy advice, citations in UN policy documents; 

-  *European development aid*: influenced thinking of German Ministry for Development Cooperation on industrial influence on inclusive health care, including their support for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan of Action for East Africa; 

-  *International NGOs:\-* contributions by invitation to policy shaping by *Médicins sans Frontières* and the Access to Medicines Index; citations in NGO policy documents.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 A series of externally funded research projects and consultancies since 2006 **\[G1\-G4\]** have cumulatively built up an influential body of evidence on the benefits of local manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and other health supplies for health care quality and access to medicines and care in East Africa, in synergy with local industrial development. The ongoing policy\-focused research programme uniquely combines analysis of low\-income country health care systems with a corresponding investigation into local manufacturing capacity and the scope for synergies in linking industrialisation and development. The findings link huge unmet needs for essential medicines and supplies to the scope for locally based manufacturers to serve domestic health markets much more effectively **\[O1\]**, a topic which is now high profile because of the current pandemic. 

 The Open University \(OU\) team is led by **Mackintosh**, and includes Simonetti, Kale, Santos, **Papaioannou** and Cross \(all current OU staff\) as well as **Banda**, **Mugwagwa** and **Clark** \(previous OU staff\), and long\-term Visiting OU Fellows: Paula Tibandebage and Smita Srinivas. The research has traced, both internationally and locally in East Africa, manufacturing capabilities, supply chains, procurement processes, market structures and availability, price and access to supplies for health care. The projects, in Tanzania and Kenya with strong Indian collaboration, have cumulatively built up an international network of African, Indian and other scholars with policy influence, who are working to strengthen industrial\-health synergies in Africa. A widely read book **\[O1\]** drew on this network to bring together wider evidence on the developmental impact of health\-industrial synergies. 

 This research underpins the impacts listed below by providing evidence of: 

-  Locally produced medicines reaching rural and remote areas in East Africa more effectively than imports **\[O4\]**; 

-  Extensive opportunities to combine better health care with industrial development **\[O1, O2\]**; 

-  The key strengths and weaknesses of domestic supply chain linkages, and external pressures that tend to disaggregate them **\[O3\]**; 

-  The core challenges faced by locally based firms in upgrading production systems to achieve and sustain international competitiveness **\[O1\]**; 

-  Which existing policies support or undermine health\-industrial synergies **\[O2\]**; 

-  The health security dangers for Africa from very heavy reliance on Indian suppliers **\[O2, O6\]**; 

-  The crucial role of industry associations in shaping regulatory environments **\[O5\]**; 

-  How local health and procurement systems can reshape themselves to use local suppliers effectively to address population needs **\[O1, O3\]**. 

 Working with manufacturers and health policy actors, the OU team has analysed the scope for increasing local pharmaceutical production in Africa through national, regional and international policy changes, and identified conditions for synergies between local manufacturing and health sector improvement and access. Internationally, they have contributed strongly to a shift from questioning ‘whether’ local production of pharmaceuticals and related supplies was desirable in Africa to a concentration on ‘how’ this can be done in such a way as to benefit both industrial growth and the move towards Universal Health Coverage \(UHC\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This body of research addresses the problem of access to supplies and medicines in Africa and the extent to which local manufacturing improvement can assist. The issue is now very high profile, as the Covid\-19 pandemic generates nationally protective responses across the globe. The OU research group and its international network were early leaders in researching and shaping this policy field, in a manner now recognised as prescient, resulting in the following policy and practitioner impacts \(organised by type of stakeholder and influence\). 

 **\(i\) Local health sector manufacturers and manufacturing associations \(practitioner impact\)** 

 In Eastern and Southern Africa, the OU research was utilised “ *to really fill the gaps*” in advocacy papers concerning incentives for local manufacturing, and that expertise has been “ *practically very useful*” in “ *meetings where we had manufacturers and politicians together*”, as an African pharmaceutical manufacturer and head of a regional manufacturers association **\[C1\]** confirmed in 2020. He further commented that without that expertise, “ *the quality of our arguments would be less \[…\] we really would not have picked up the policy coherence*” requirement “ *because we don’t think that way*”. Two EAC officials supported by German development cooperation **\[C1\]** also confirmed in 2020 that the research “ *inspired the justification which we wrote for the EAC pharmaceutical bill*”. This justification was requested by “ *many high level decisionmakers \[...\] secretary generals of the EAC*” and was written “ *based very strongly*” on this research. The officials also confirmed that the research has “ *inspired the lobby and advocacy work of FEAPAM \[Federation of East African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Associations\]*”; the *“strong impact \[…\] provided a coherent narrative on local production of pharmaceuticals*” in relation to work on the East African *Regional Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan of Action* **\[C1\]**. Routes to these policy impacts have centrally involved the local research teams, for example, a presentation by Wangwe to the 1st East Africa Manufacturing Business Summit \(Uganda 2015\), where participants indicated messages were taken seriously because they came from independent research **\[C1\]**. The project book *Making Medicines in Africa,* launched by invitation at the Africa Pharmaceutical Summit East, March 2016, has been very widely downloaded \(now over 79,000 downloads\) and is “ *extensively quoted by authors across Africa regarding local production*” **\[C1\]**. 

 **\(ii\) East African health and industrial policy makers \(national policy influence\)** 

 National policy impact in Tanzania is evidenced by the use of text and findings from our Policy Briefs on reversing manufacturing decline in the Tanzanian *Second Five\-Year Development Plan \(2016\)* **\[C2\]** in support of a decision to prioritise pharmaceutical manufacturing development; that commitment was followed by a sharp increase in budgeted government funding for purchase of medicines, recognising the local synergies identified. Government members requested summary findings from the research team to feed into that document **\[C2\]**. The route to this striking national impact was through the close involvement of Tanzanian research team members in policy\-oriented research design; involving policy makers in research question identification; and through workshops for mutual feedback between senior policy makers and the research team leading, for example to citation of the team’s findings by the Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Industry and Trade in Tanzania at an EAC workshop in September 2015 **\[C2\]**. The research team also contributed on request detailed policy recommendations in June 2015 to a high\-level task force chaired by COSTECH  \(which manages scientific research in Tanzania\); while a 3\-day UNCTAD\-COSTECH workshop in Tanzania November 2015 on industry\-health links included an invited presentation from the team. At EAC level, the “ *justification*” for an EAC Pharmaceutical Bill, discussed in the Ugandan parliament in May 2020 was “ *inspired*” by the research evidence **\[C1\]**. 

 **\(iii\) International UN bodies and donor governments \(international policy influence\)** 

 This body of research has influenced UNIDO policy work since 2009. Two UNIDO officials **\[C3\]** reported that guidance from **Mackintosh** and **Banda**, research team members, “ *formed the backbone of the policy advice disseminated in the UNIDO guide*” on incentives for pharmaceutical production in Africa, published in 2019 \(no date on text\) **\[C3\]**.  In particular, **Mackintosh** “ *persuaded \[the official\] that market protection is a very important tool*”, when previously he “ *was quite opposed*”. The research “ *has certainly influenced what we \[UNIDO\] say*”. Without the research UNIDO “ *would not have the evidence base we have*”; the research is “ *cited on regular occasions”* and “ *has had quite a profound influence on our thinking and the way forward*”. “ *The international community is now aligned*” behind the local production agenda, and this research “ *certainly contributed a lot to that*” culminating in the joint agencies’ declaration at the World Health Assembly \(WHA\) in 2019 **\[C3\]**. UN and other multilateral  policy documents that have cited our work include UNRISD 2016 Flagship report on *Policy Innovations for Transformative Change* **\[C3\]**; the World Bank on *Creating Markets in Kenya* **\[C3\]**; and the UNDP Access and Delivery Partnership report on local pharmaceutical production in Tanzania **\[C3\]**. The unique research impact in the field is attested by the invitation to **Mackintosh** as the only academic presenting at the Ministerial\-level UNCTAD\-UNAIDS\-African Union side\-event at the World Investment Forum 2016 on pharmaceutical manufacturing. Additionally, a UNIDO official **\[C3\]** stated that the OU research programme is still “ *ahead of the curve*” on research and policy. 

 A German development cooperation official **\[C4\]** stated in 2020 that she commissioned an evidence brief **\[C4\]** from the team that was “ *able to show that it \[local manufacture of pharmaceuticals\] has spin\-off effects into the wider health context*”, including regulatory improvement and emergency preparedness. The report was presented at a WHO consultation, and the official stated that this was “ *very helpful*” in providing evidence where previously it was “ *very sketchy*”. She further noted that WHO people are “ *quite sceptical*” about the local production agenda, but it has now “ *found its way back onto the roadmap of access to medicines at the WHO*”. The research has helped German Development Cooperation “t *o communicate the wider impacts of local pharmaceutical production \[…\] very well*”. 

 In South Africa, a Department of Trade and Industry official **\[C5\]** attended a 2015 workshop on biopharmaceutical industry associations at the OU. She stated that this meeting facilitated a better understanding of the policy role of trade associations and generated new contacts for her work especially outside South Africa. In the UK, the project **\[G2\]** was the sole case selected in 2017 to showcase the impact of the DfID/ESRC Growth Programme to a new DfID Minister **\[C5\]**. A major follow\-on project on industry\-health synergies for cancer care has been funded **\[G4\]**: the funding panel feedback recognised the scope to build on the earlier project’s impact networks and pathways. 

 **International NGOs \(influence on policy thinking\)** 

 Some growing impact of this research can be evidenced on policy thinking by international NGOs. The OU team’s evidence that locally produced medicines reach rural areas more effectively than imports **\[O4\]** is cited in the South Centre’s report on TRIPS and medicines **\[C6\]**. **Mackintosh** was consulted in 2016 on institutional policy by *Médicins sans Frontières* \(MSF\), which at the time was reconsidering its role in global health policy and wished to reflect on its sources of supplies. Following the meeting, an MSF official **\[C6\]** stated that “ *I think you have contributed a lot to helping people to think differently about some common assumptions in MSF*”. The team was also consulted in 2017 as a stakeholder by the Access to Medicines Foundation on the methodology for their 2018 Index. A Foundation official wrote that the input on local manufacturing capacity building had been “ *so valuable*” **\[C6\]**. 

 **Summary** 

 This research has contributed strongly, as evidenced, to a major shift in policy thinking, decisions and action, and to manufacturers’ involvement in that process, on the subject of health\-related local manufacturing in Africa and its importance for local health care quality and access. The impact is evidenced within the private sector; at national, regional and international level; and increasingly in NGO thinking. The Covid\-19 pandemic has dramatically increased recognition, among African and international stakeholders, of the importance of African industrial supply capabilities for local health care systems, and the research team is continuing to work actively in this field both in research and responding to requests for policy involvement.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 The majority of material culture is perishable and seldom survives archaeologically. This presents an interpretation and presentation challenge for the heritage sector. Hurcombe’s use of experimental archaeology has generated innovative multi\-sensory approaches to both understand and display this intangible heritage. Collaborating with conventional and open\-air museums, as well as traditional skills specialists, across 14 countries in Europe and North America, Hurcombe has achieved the following impacts: 

1.  **Innovating and enhancing the presentation of heritage** in museums through the introduction of new media and touchable interactive objects. 

1.  **Developing the skills and knowledge** of professional staff, volunteers, re\-enactors and crafter communities associated with open\-air museums, as well as the ancestral skills and bushcraft specialists and instructors involved in public engagement. 

1.  **Boosting the role and status of archaeological open air\-museums** within the international heritage sector and improving the quality of their visitor engagement.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Hurcombe’s research has demonstrated the importance of perishable material culture, such as organic objects and textiles, which form the ‘missing majority’ of the archaeological record because they rarely survive **\[3.3\].** Where such artefacts do preserve it is usually in a discoloured, fragmentary and fragile condition **.** Presenting the significance of this material culture to the public is a challenge for the heritage sector. Drawing on her expertise in experimental archaeology and leadership of transdisciplinary projects, Hurcombe has spent the last 15 years helping the sector develop knowledge about perishable material culture and the means to engage with deteriorated materiality of past societies from across the globe. 

  

 Between 2005 and 2008, grant funding from Lejre enabled Hurcombe’s detailed trials of nettle processing, based on evidence from stone tools. This was achieved in collaboration with their expert weavers and before a public audience **\[3.2\].** These trials highlighted the importance of an engaged transdisciplinary approach, working with and for the heritage sector as well as involving the public as active participants in the research. An EPSRC\-AHRC Science and Heritage network grant followed, ‘ *Touching the Untouchable*’ \(2009\-2011\), in which Hurcombe directed an interdisciplinary team of geographers \(led by Mark Paterson, Exeter\), computer scientists \(led by Steve Brewster, Glasgow\) and physicists \(Ian Summers, Exeter\) to explore how fragile ancient objects could be made ‘touchable’. Through a series of international workshops, the project demonstrated the potential for using computer interfaces and technologies such as 3D printing and craft replicas to engage visitors with museum collections in multi\-sensory ways **\[3.1\].** Hurcombe’s AHRC project, ‘ *Touching the Past’* \(2013\-14; Co\-I Mark Wright, Information Science, Edinburgh\), advanced the agenda by recording public reactions to traditional\-crafted replicas and a variety of IT\-mediated experiences within museum settings \(including 3D prints, a haptic mouse delivering sensations to a fingertip via a pin array, and 3D projection experiences\). Both *Touch* projects involved proof\-of\-concept public trials \(2011\-14\) which were conducted in partnership with Scottish museums \(Sanday Heritage Centre; Bute Museum; the Museum nan Eilean, Stornoway; and National Museums Scotland\). This also led to a new collaboration with Plymouth Museum, delivering insights from public evaluation and resources for multi\-sensory presentation of heritage **\[3.6\].** 

 Beyond traditional museums, Hurcombe’s expertise has found vital application in the Archaeological Open\-Air Museums \(AOAMs\) sector. AOAMs deal first\-hand with the ‘missing majority’, as they strive to present the past as it might have been in life, with a rich material culture of structures, furnishings and artefacts. Experimental archaeology is the best way of helping them resurrect the tangible from the ephemeral, since unfamiliar processes and materials are especially challenging to present. As a leading figure in experimental archaeology, Hurcombe was the only university\-based partner to participate in the EU\-funded *OpenArch* project \(2011\-2015\) which brought together best practice and used research \(such as workshops and experimental activities, chiefly driven by Exeter\) to raise the professional standards in, and the status of AOAMs. 

 The consortium included nine European AOAMs and EXARC, the key organisation representing the AOAM sector and an International Council of Museums\-affiliated body. Hurcombe led three of *OpenArch’s* international workshops, including one \(Dec 2013\) that focused on ‘ *Touching the Past’*, as well as co\-organising the Dialogue with Science international conference in Finland. This combination of workshops and conference led to an output **\[3.5\]** which theorised the research agendas and practice of structures within AOAMs as an open\-access collaborative monograph developed with and for the sector. Hurcombe also produced an open\-access paper explaining the unique contribution of AOAMs to the heritage sector **\[3.4\].** 

 Both *Touch* projects and *OpenArch* researched multi\-sensory heritage. They were conducted in tandem, at an international level, and engaged a broad group of specialist researchers, heritage professionals and end\-users to bring the past to life.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Hurcombe’s work has generated impact across three main areas: helping museums enhance presentation of perishable material culture; the development of skills and knowledge of specialists and professional staff associated with the AOAM sector; and improving the professional standards and raising the status of AOAMs. 

###  1. Innovating and enhancing presentation of perishable material culture 

 The *Touch* projects disseminated approaches to the display of perishable material culture in presentations and a portable exhibition in Britain, Europe, and USA. Drawing on this experience Hurcombe and her team contributed ideas, samples and support to four further museums in three countries, to help create more multi\-sensory presentations and increase quality of visitor engagement using 3D and crafted replicas. 

  

 **In the UK**, Hurcombe built on public trials from the *Touch* projects to produce two replicas of unique perishable artefacts, a bracelet and a textile panel, originally crafted for a BBC programme ‘Mystery of the Moor’ \(airing Feb\-May 2014 on BBC1 SW, BBC2, and BBC4\) **\[5.1\]**, and created a touchable 3D print installation of a basket – an international first – for a three\-month exhibition \(Sep\-Dec 2014\) at Plymouth City Museum. The exhibition attracted 17,191 visitors, prompting comments such as: ‘ *\[t\]ouching the past is fascinating – really nice to be able to feel the basket’* and *‘the replicas brought the finds to life’* **\[5.1\]**. The replicas influenced Plymouth Museum’s development of permanent displays in its new iteration as The Box \(opened 29/9/20, following a £40Million refit and redevelopment\). Displays there now include multi\-sensory exhibits such as crafted replicas and samples of nettle cloth planned to form a touchable installation \(the latter delayed by Covid\-19\), all made by Hurcombe **. \[5.1\]** 

 **In the Netherlands**, Hurcombe gave a lecture and an interview \(Oct 2014; 23,015 views since appearing online\), and presented displays \(Nov 2015\), at the Hunebedcentrum prehistoric centre near Borger. The museum acknowledged Hurcombe’s influence in their development of 3D print\-mediated installations as part of its new galleries: “ *the ideas of 3D printing are picked up from* \[her\] *visit”*. They are now using the installations and the multi\-sensory approach in their work with 600 Dutch schools as an innovative way of teaching about the past, and planning to develop 3D models with visitors with visual impairment in mind. **\[5.2\]** 

  

 **In Denmark**,12 crafted replicas of different tanning technologies \(described in **3.3**\) were lent to the Danish National Museum for their exhibition ‘Fur, an Issue of Life and Death’ \(Oct 2014\-Feb 2015\) which attracted c. 50,000 visitors. The museum subsequently commissioned further crafted replicas **\[5.3\].** In Roskilde, the Viking Ship Museum hosted a travelling international Viking exhibition \(Apr 2014\-Jul 2015, attracting 146,891 visitors\) alongside which Hurcombe’s 3D print objects were used in related educational experiences. Museum testimony states: *“\[It is\] the first such ‘printed reproduction’ taken into use in an education and outreach capacity at the museum and has proved to be a successful endeavour. The objects have stayed with the museum at our request and are still in use today.”* **\[5.4\]** 

###  2. Developing the skills and knowledge of AOAM professional staff, volunteers, re\-enactors, and traditional skill specialists \(TSS\) 

  

 Hurcombe and her team have contributed to the development of practitioner competencies and expertise, crucial for the preservation of perishable culture among the user communities across the globe. They have delivered 63 events in 14 countries in Europe and North America since Aug 2013, to develop the knowledge and skills of museum staff and volunteers, and the TSS communities often associated with AOAMs **\[5.9\]**. TSS communities is a term used here for craft specialists, volunteers, historical interpreters, re\-enactors and bushcrafters in Europe, and ancestral skills specialists, survival instructors and indigenous craftspeople in North America, where ‘re\-enactors’ can imply cultural appropriation. 

  

 Hurcombe and her team have worked at three Europe\-based annual events with c. 520 re\-enactors from all over the world and were involved in the establishment of the annual international European Stone Age Gatherings re\-enactors event which has met since 2016. **\[5.2\]** The science camps and workshops delivered there have provided, at Lejre ‘\[c\] *rafted replicas and 3D\-prints…to explain technologies and processes, and present tangible evidence of the material world of the past. … Instructors, Stone Age re\-enactors, volunteers and the public are all beneficiaries.’  \[5.5\]** 

  

 These demonstrations have enhanced the skills of museums’ staff and volunteers. At Foteviken, Sweden, they have enabled them to ensure that *‘staff, students and volunteers…act appropriately within the Viking town. … The staff \[have\] elevate\[d\] the quality of the information being passed onto the visitors as a result. This knowledge is also passed on to our volunteers and trainees.*” **\[5.2\]** Archaeological\-Ecological Center Albersdorf \(AOZA\) note that their model of staff and volunteer training and development created through the collaboration with Exeter has *“influenced other museums in the region and wider community which are currently taking up some of the ideas”.* **\[5.2\]** 

  

 For the TSS communities, the workshops have ensured that these specialists “ *see the process and talk about the possibilities of historical tanning*”, as for a Czech professional historic shoemaker, or to use the knowledge “ *for presenting prehistoric techniques to every kind of public”*, as in the case of Sapiens Origins, a traditional skills school in France, or even to start a private elementary and high school with ancient skills as curriculum, like for one Dutch educator, the workshops give the chance to “ *inform other people about the importance that we are still able to work with our hands instead of just our heads*” \(Dutch re\-enactor\). **\[5.6\]** 

  

 In the very different US context, Hurcombe’s archaeological craft perspective has benefited ancestral skills instructors and indigenous skills practitioners. She was honoured to be approached to help the basketry knowledge\-keeper of the Cherokee Nation to recreate their lost technology for creating clothing from mulberry tree bast fibres. A primitive skills instructor working with the Cherokee elders confirms ‘ *a few women of Cherokee descent are attempting resurrection of long ago mulberry sourced clothing. We started along this amazing project with Linda’s help, advice, research and knowledge. \[…\] With Linda’s knowledge and understanding we were able to ID 3 yr approx. 1” stalks served best to produce fibers …We are grateful to be a part of bringing this traditional knowledge, once lost, back into Cherokee life in present day’.* **\[5.6\]** 

  

###  3. Improving the professional standards – and status – of AOAMs 

  

 Through workshops, the introduction of crafted replicas and 3D prints, and dissemination of information and best practice, Hurcombe and her team contributed to the improvement in the AOAMs’ working standards, and the sector’s status and visibility more generally **\[5.7\]**. This was achieved via the *OpenArch* project but also through independent collaborations. For example, Hurcombe helped initiate an annual Science camp at Leijre \(Denmark\) in 2015 which the Head & Manager of Lejre Prehistoric Areas considers *“created a great and concrete change, as visitors began to come specifically for it”* \[…\] *“I would put emphasis on the declared intention, every year, by some visitors to come back and to revisit the genuine Stone Age museum collections ‘with new eyes’, after having experienced the fabrication process, the use and vivid design of these artefacts ‘in situation’ LIVE.”* **\[5.5\]** Additionally, a video presentation incorporating Hurcombe’s nettle\-processing **\[3.2\]** has been shown in the entrance cinema at the museum since 2013 and is seen by most of the 60,000 annual visitors, as well as having had 36,233 YouTube views since 2014, demonstrating the wider appetite for such approaches **. \[5.5\]** 

  

 The *OpenArch* project was successful in its aim to raise the professional standards of AOAMs and increase their role in the heritage sector via museum interactions and best\-practice sharing, experimental activities, workshops, and open\-access resources **\[3.4;3.5\].** By 2018, their representative body, EXARC, whose board Hurcombe joined in May 2018, saw a 39% increase in institutional membership compared to 2013. Footfall also increased, with nine project partner museums seeing 1.2 million annual visitors and the sector as a whole in Europe an estimated 19 million visitors per year **\[5.7\]**. In the words of Hunebedcentrum director: **‘** *We are not only local, not only provincial, but we are now national and international: Openarch was part of that growth.*’ **\[5.2\]**. 

  

 For the Viminacium Archaeological Park in Kostolac, Serbia, the project *“helped experimental archaeology gain validity within Serbia*” and become *“more accepted as an approach to research and public presentation in the region”*. For Bjorn Jakobsen, director of the Foteviken Viking Museum in Sweden, Hurcombe and her team’s hands\-on engagement with the museums and its staff and volunteers enabled *“access to knowledge of very high standard … allowing us to get the university level of knowledge into more of what we do, and what we present to visitors*”. **\[5.2\]** 

  

 For some of the participating AOAMs, including the German AOZA, Hurcombe and her team’s involvement led to concrete plans to change practice, based on the quality of visitor engagement created by the collaboration. According to their Executive Director, “ *\[t\]he overall positive response from the park’s visitors in reaction to the university’s unique style of presenting science as multisensory heritage for the public has led the museum to plan further experimental weeks. … The roadshow with science has inspired the park with its multisensory approach to heritage. \[We plan\] to put together a similar travelling display for markets and other venues for educational purposes.”* **\[5.2\]** 

  

 In addition to open\-access research outputs **\[3.4, 3.5\]** used by staff, volunteers and re\-enactors within the sector and beyond, *OpenArch* further delivered four manuals for AOAMs, covering dialogue with visitors, management and communication issues, and relationships with traditional museums \(5,160 downloads as of 2019\) **\[5.7; 5.8\]**. The project also featured direct public engagement via the above cited ‘Exeter Dialogue with Science Roadshow’, a series of annual events held since 2015 at ten venues across Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the UK. The events disseminated the multi\-sensory and experimental archaeology approach **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]** to a wider number of museum staff and volunteers, and presented material directly to the public \(c. 20,000 visitors in 2015 and more than 10,000 in subsequent years\).The EXARC director testifies that \[ **3.5**\] is valued in the sector for its ‘ *clear bringing together of hands on knowledge within the academically acceptable framework*’ and that Hurcombe’s and her team’s workshops that ‘ *brought people within the visitor\-facing staff together to learn things that they were able to pass on back in their own museum situation \[…\] made a significant difference to bring the science to the museums*’. **\[5.7\].** Exeter is setting a trend to put current science directly back into heritage arenas; to quote the prehistory manager from Lejre \(2019\) – ‘ *the academics are back\!’* **\[5.5\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Mauritius has the world’s 2<sup>nd</sup> highest Diabetes fatality rate. Lewis’s expertise in the early identification of Peripheral Arterial Disease \(PAD\) and experience establishing UK screening led to her appointment to establish Diabetic foot screening within a Mauritian national screening programme. As a result, 78 Nurses covering 149 centres have been trained, conducting 239,888 screenings between 2016 and 2019. Actions taken as a direct result of these PAD screenings will save at least 2,144 lives by 2029 and the success of the Mauritius screenings has led to requests for a similar programme from the government of Trinidad **.** 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Background 

 As an experienced clinician by 2002, Lewis had concerns over the lack of systematic early intervention programmes for Peripheral Arterial Disease \(PAD\). These concerns led to her embarking on a PhD at Cardiff University under the supervision of Prof. David Owens, then Director of the Diabetes Research Network for Wales, Consultant Diabetologist and Clinical Lead for Diabetes at Cardiff & Vale University Health Board.  Her novel PhD research showed that Pulse Volume Waveform \(PVW\) profiles were more effective in identifying PAD than the standard method for measuring peripheral lower limb blood flow – known as ‘manual ankle\-brachial pressure’ \(ABI\). ABI has known limitations in detecting lower limb arterial diseases, partly because Diabetes can cause arterial stiffening. As a direct result of Lewis’ PhD findings, Huntleigh Diagnostics developed a PVW capability for their ‘Dopplex Ability’ Automatic Ankle Brachial Index System machine, which was launched in \(2010\)**Footnote:**

 This device has since been sold in 66 countries, generating £8,675,000. A letter from Huntleigh is available to confirm Lewis’ influence on its design development but is not included in this submission because both Lewis’ PhD and the Dopplex launch predate her employment with Cardiff Metropolitan University. Details included here for contextual information only. 
. 

 Research at Cardiff Metropolitan University 

 On joining Cardiff Met, Lewis continued her research into developing efficient, low cost and accurate PAD screening, the findings of which underpinned the Diabetic foot screening programme in Mauritius. For example, it involved validating PVW’s accuracy, testing efficiency concepts in foot screening to save time and money and developing further insights into the connections between rapid expert assessment of lower\-limb ulcer episodes and healing. 

 As part of this programme of research, between 2014 and 2017, Lewis established the accuracy of the low cost, easy\-to\-use PVW method, testing it on 189 patients against the datum of the current ‘gold standard’ test \- an expensive, non\-portable ultrasound duplex scanner operated by a highly trained Medical Physicist. The Dopplex Ability in PVW mode gave 97% similar results \[R1\]. A further study of 326 patients examined the feasibility of reducing costs and improving screening through increased efficiency by conducting Diabetes foot screening as part of an existing national Diabetes Retinopathy Screening programme. This study used the Dopplex Ability’s now clinically proven PVW function to automate PAD measurement. A non\-technical healthcare worker conducted 3\-5\-minute tests during an existing 20\-minute pupil dilation break in the screening required for retinal photographs to be taken. Previously undiagnosed PAD was found in 26.4% of patients. Following the trial 100 patients were contacted at random and asked about the experience. All supported the approach becoming standard practice \[R2\]. Lewis was also part of a team behind the National Diabetes Foot Care Audit \(NDFA\) that collected details of over 33,000 ulcer episodes in over 27,000 people in England and Wales between 2015 and 2018. The team confirmed the critical need for early diagnosis, and found ulcers referred for assessment within 14 days were significantly less severe and likely to heal within 12 weeks \[R3\]. 

 Why Mauritius? 

 The use of Lewis’s research expertise in Mauritius came via her PhD supervisor, Prof. Owens. In 2006 Owens was invited to advise the country on how to develop a proactive scheme to deal with Mauritius’s Diabetes problem through retinopathy screening. Owens eventually realised that a wider\-ranging programme was needed, so in 2013\-14 he formed a foot screening team of seven. Lewis’s PAD expertise led to her appointment as head of the PAD screening development programme \[E1\] and the impacts described here. It also contributed to a UK Royal College of Physicians Excellence in Patient Care International Award in 2018 \[E2\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 ""Over the last five years, a huge leap has been made in terms of structuring the diabetic foot care clinics across Mauritius” \- Head of Diabetic and Vascular Health Centre, Mauritius \[E4\]. 

 Mauritius, a low to middle income country, is  [world number 2 for Diabetes\-related deaths](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/mauritius-diabetes-mellitus)**Footnote:**

 Note that this data is subject to change. Accurate at time of writing – 25/11/20 
. The nation’s intake of both sugar and alcohol is high, which goes some way to explaining why, according to the World Health Rankings, 26% of all deaths in Mauritius are linked to Diabetes Mellitus. In part this is because, prior to 2014, Mauritius had no proactive, structured Diabetes screening programme. 

 Low levels of intensive care services further heightened the need for a structured and formal screening programme to reduce the burden on existing services: The UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division  [estimates Mauritius’ population at 1,271,767](https://population.un.org/wpp/), yet at the time of writing, there is only one Podiatrist, one Vascular Surgeon and one Orthotist to serve the entire island. Lowering the number of patients needing the services of these professions is therefore a critical step to improving survival rates from Diabetes Mellitus. 

 Lewis established Mauritius’s first systematic Diabetic foot screening programme in 2014 \[E3\]. In doing so she drew on her experience of developing screening in the UK. For example, she is part of a comprehensive partnership including Welsh Government and Public Health Wales to pilot ‘One Stop Shop’ diabetes screening programme for the 196,000 people with Diabetes registered in Wales – an evolution of her feasibility study into combining PAD and retinopathy screening \[R2\]. 

 In Mauritius, Lewis trained 18 nurses as fully qualified Diabetic Footcare Officers \(DFCOs\), dealing in ulcer management, foot screening and the use of PVW to test for PAD \- one of the key signs of advancing Diabetes. These 18 DFCOs consequently established foot screening clinics in all 6 of Mauritius’s hospitals, training a further 60 Diabetes Specialist Nurses to serve 149 centres throughout Mauritius in the foot care of Diabetic patients \[E4\]. Further, all new trainee doctors and nurses also received intensive training by the DFCOs.  This relationship between the DFCOs and medics has had a sizeable effect, with the referral rate of patients to specialist Diabetic Footcare Units rising 57% from 3,263 in 2016 to 5,650 in 2018. The collective effect of this activity has been marked. Between 2016 and 2019, Mauritius moved from having **no** systematic Diabetic foot screening, to screening 239,888 people previously diagnosed with Diabetes, marking a critical breakthrough in dealing with a serious national health problem. Lewis’s foot screening programme is therefore an essential step in improving the survival rates of people with Diabetes in Mauritius because it allows early detection of PAD before ulceration. 

 Mauritius’s 26% Diabetes fatality rate means that in the normal course of events, at least 62,300 of these 239,888 people would have developed the fatally serious lower limb circulatory diseases associated with the advanced stages of Diabetes. One of the first signs of these diseases are Diabetic Foot Ulcers \(DFUs\). Between 2016 and 2019 5,611 Mauritians had DFUs, but no previous diagnosis of Diabetes\-related foot disease. Of these, 3,046 were healed thanks to early detection \(\[E5\], \[E6\], \[E7\], \[E8\]\). Ulcers that progress too far to be healed are the first point of a sequence of events that lead to limb amputations and death. In 2015,  [a systematic review of studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/iwj.12404) found that 40% of patients with DFUs had died after 5 years. A  [2012 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447849/) found that 70.4% had died after 10 years [](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447849/). We can therefore construe that between 2016 and 2019, 3,046 Mauritians were saved from the suffering associated with limb loss, that around 1,218 will not die of Diabetes by 2024 and that approximately 2,144 will not die of it by 2029 as the statistics suggest they otherwise would**Footnote:**

 Figures for the whole period would likely demonstrate further impacts but are unavailable. 
. An  [average Mauritian household of 3.5 people](https://population.un.org/Household/index.html)  means that for each of these 3,046 individuals whose ulcers were healed thanks to early detection, a further 2.5 individuals \- 7,615 people \- were saved from the direct consequences of the death of a family member. Since many people with Diabetes are parents and breadwinners, there is an extended but presently unquantifiable impact in terms of poverty prevented. 

 Lastly, Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke are  [Mauritius’ 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> greatest killers](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/mauritius-diabetes-mellitus) at 19.9% and 11.6% respectively**Footnote:**

 Note that this data is subject to change. Accurate at time of writing – 25/11/20 
. PAD is a risk factor for both diseases meaning that an unknown number of Mauritians will also not develop these diseases because of Lewis’ PAD screening. 

 Further reach 

 Following the success of PAD screening programme in Mauritius, Lewis has been asked to lead a PAD screening programme in Trinidad \[E10\] where Diabetes is the second leading cause of death at over  [17% of all deaths](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/trinidad-tobago-diabetes-mellitus), with coronary heart disease and strokes as the number 1 and number 3 causes of death respectively.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Dr Marina Davila Ross’ research on orangutan long calls has contributed to the first discovery of a new living ape species in nearly a century, the Tapanuli orangutan. With fewer than 800 individuals, it is the most endangered great ape species in the world. As a result, the Tapanuli orangutan has been classified as Critically Endangered \(to become Extinct\), instigating global protection legislation and conservation action plans to preserve the species. She has also co\-developed methods to assess the survival potential of rehabilitant orangutans with conservation and government organisations in Malaysia. These methods have improved release programmes, reduced the risk of unsuccessful releases and contributed to the survival of the species. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 This Impact Case Study is the result of a body of research undertaken between 2009 and 2017 by **Davila Ross**, University of Portsmouth, in collaboration with a range of academic institutions and a conservation organisation in Zambia \(Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage\). This research has provided an innovative approach to developing evolutionary relationships, or ‘phylogenetic trees’, among orangutan species, using acoustic analysis of orangutan long call data. It has also demonstrated the presence of individual variations in fitness\-related behaviours in great apes that have relevance to conservation strategies. 

 **Using acoustic analysis of orangutan long calls to determine phylogenetic trees** 

 Orangutan loud calls \(usually termed long calls\) are emitted by adult males; they are relatively stereotyped, species\-specific and have been proposed to function as a spacing device among males and to attract females. **Davila Ross** has pioneered the idea that, if great apes rely on long\-distance calls to communicate to other members of the species, then the acoustic analysis of such long calls may be used to map phylogenetic trees. **Davila Ross** first demonstrated that acoustic analysis could be used to establish distinctions between orangutan populations whilst at the University of Hannover under the supervision of Dr Geissmann \( [American Journal of Primatology, 69\(3\), 305\-324](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajp.20356?casa_token=D-I2GbhbEusAAAAA:CqsIWnb4ehXlG2zUw1BCu7lpDd451Vc1ZJ_cU3QKwiqD6vJZIwRmhlygUyYtleBNuEmZYjjYJzZxVA)\). Following her move to Portsmouth, she further developed her acoustic analysis methodology to confirm that it was a reliable method that, in the same way that geneticists use genetic data, enabled the identification of phylogenetic trees. Specifically, she compared orangutan long calls across populations to challenge the long\-held assumption of a strict dichotomy between Sumatran and Bornean orangutan species \( **R1**\) and she created phylogenetic trees based on acoustic analysis across great ape species \( **R2**, **R3**\). 

 **The contribution of phylogenetic acoustic analysis of long call data to the discovery of a new orangutan species \( **Pongo tapanuliensis**\)** 

 Prior to 2017, it was believed that there were just two orangutan species, Bornean and Sumatran orangutans. However, an expedition in 1997 \(Meijaard, 1997\) reported the presence of a small population of orangutans in North Sumatra that seemed phylogenetically different. A further expedition in 2016 estimated that there were only approximately 800 individuals left in this population \(Wich et al, 2016\). The process to determine whether this was a new species of orangutan required complex genetic, behavioural, ecological and morphological analyses. Hence, an international team of researchers, including **Davila Ross**, joined forces to carry out a large interdisciplinary study to conduct an exhaustive phylogenetic analysis of the genetic, behavioural, and morphological data each team held on existing orangutan populations. For this study, **Davila Ross** contributed her recordings of orangutan long calls and developed a more sophisticated acoustic coding scheme by systematically selecting the strongest acoustic indicators of species variation \( **R4**\). 

 Combined analysis of these data confirmed **Davila Ross**’ acoustic analysis methods as reliable, non\-invasive indicators of species classification, as they mirrored and complemented the conclusions from genetic and morphological data. Most importantly, these analyses revealed the clear distinction of this orangutan population from the two, already\-known, orangutan species, Bornean and Sumatran orangutans, and its classification as a new species, *Pongo tapanuliensis* or the Tapanuli orangutan. 

 **Individual variation in fitness\-related behaviours in great apes** 

 **Davila Ross**’ research has also confirmed that there are individual and colony variations in fitness\-related behaviours in great apes. Fitness\-related behaviours are those associated with activities that improve the chances of species survival, such as feeding, foraging and nest\-building. In collaboration with the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage \(Zambia\), **Davila Ross** found colony\-level \( **R5**\) and individual\-level \( **R6**\) differences in fitness\-related foraging behaviours across colonies of semi\-wild chimpanzees. Crucially, and based on her long\-standing collaborations with animal conservation centres in Malaysia and Indonesia, **Davila Ross** recognised the potential for this enhanced understanding of individual fitness\-related behaviours to be incorporated into strategies for the rehabilitation and reintroduction of ex\-captive or displaced animals back into their habitats 

 These findings had important implications for the conservation of great apes and, specifically, on strategies for the rehabilitation and reintroduction of ex\-captive or displaced animals back into their habitats.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Orangutans are a flagship species endemic to the tropical rainforests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, Indonesia and the only great apes of Asia. They play a vital role in maintaining the health of the forest ecosystem, which hosts other important large species, including tigers, Asian elephants and Sumatran rhinos. Unfortunately, due to illegal wildlife trade and rapid deforestation, their numbers have fallen significantly. **Research by Davila Ross has made a significant contribution to the conservation of the only remaining orangutan populations in the world.**  Specifically, her research has contributed to the identification of a new species of orangutan that is now protected under international law and conservation actions plans. Additionally, Davila Ross has co\-developed methods to enhance successful rates of rehabilitation programmes for ex\-captive and displaced orangutans. 

######  Protection of a new orangutan species, the Tapanuli orangutans 

 The confirmation of *Pongo tapanuliensis* as a new species of orangutan \( **R4**\) was the first discovery of a new living great ape species in nearly a century. It is considered to be one of the most significant scientific findings in the past 5 years and was a runner up in Science Magazine’s Breakthrough of the Year in 2017 \( **S1**\). Crucially, this discovery was made in time to prevent the Tapanuli orangutans from becoming extinct. In December 2017, upon receipt of the research report \( **R4**\) and in view of the estimate that only 800 individual animals remained, the International Union for Conservation of Nature included the Tapanuli orangutan in the Red List of Threatened Species as ‘Critically Endangered’ \( **S2**\). At that time, the IUCN predicted a population decline of up to 83% within three generations and inevitable global extinction of the Tapanuli orangutan if no conservation actions were taken \( **S2**\). 

 As a result of IUCN Red List inclusion, a portfolio of conservation actions have been put in place to help ensure continuity of the species and its habitat. These include: 

-  **International legislation regulating trade**: The Tapanuli orangutan is included within *Pongo abelii* in Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species \(CITES\). CITES is an international agreement between governments that seeks to prevent unsustainable exploitation of wild fauna or flora from international trade. In general, all international commercial trade in species listed in CITES Appendix 1 is banned. There are currently 183 Parties signed up to the Convention including the European Union \(EU\), Russian Federation, United States of America, China and Indonesia. Additionally, all countries within the EU are bound by further trading prohibitions and restrictions under  [European Commission Regulation \(EU\) 2019/2117](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32019R2117) that directly references species in CITES Appendix 1. 

-  **International advocacy to prevent destruction of Tapanuli habitat**: In 2018, North Sumatra Hydro Energy \(NSHE\) submitted plans to develop a hydroelectric power plant in the only known habitat of the *Pongo tapanuliensis* \- a small area of only 1,500km<sup>2</sup> within the Batang Toru Ecosystem, North Sumatra. This area is divided into three distinct forest habitats. Protection of these areas, as well as the maintenance and extension of corridors between them, is vital to the survival of the species. The submitted plans for the power plant would have isolated one of the areas, limited the options for reconnecting the other two and would have impacted upon nearly 10% of the total population of *P. tapanuliensis*. Research commissioned by the Indonesian Government resulted in the inclusion of wildlife management measures into the proposals, including building of orangutan bridges, planting of fruit trees in key locations, monitoring and evaluation of the Tapanuli orangutans and regular anti\-poaching patrols \( **S3**\). Nevertheless, the proposal was met with widespread international objection including publications in prestigious global media and academic outlets \( **S4**\) and an international  [Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/bank-of-china-save-batang-toru-and-the-rarest-ape-in-the-world-2?recruited_by_id=81f861f0-53d0-11e5-8809-63fd6429c2e8) petition \( **S5**\) calling for the Bank of China, a major investor in the project, to withdraw funding. This petition had been signed by over 1,300,000 people by 31 December 2020. In October 2019, the IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group on Great Apes made an international appeal for a moratorium on any hydroelectric power development in the Tapanuli orangutan range \( **S6**\). In April 2020, the IUCN published the Batang Toru Hydropower Project Fact Check that ‘ *identifies specific assertions made by NSHE and assesses them against the best scientific knowledge available*’ \( **S7**\). In  [March 2019](https://www.boc.cn/en/bocinfo/bi2/201903/t20190304_14882309.html), the Bank of China ‘noted the concerns expressed by some environmental organisations’ and announced it would re\-evaluate its support for the project. Most recently \( [July 2020](https://news.mongabay.com/2020/07/batang-toru-hydropower-dam-tapanuli-orangutan-delay-nshe/)\), a decision has been taken to delay the project for three years **,** allowing further time for studies to assess the impacts of the project on the Tapanuli orangutan. 

-  **Conservation action plans:** In 2017, the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme \(SOCP\) \- a collaboration between the Indonesian Nature Conservation Authority and the international conservation organisation PanEco \- launched a monitoring programme to protect the Tapanuli organutans. There are now five dedicated full\-time members of staff employed at the Batang Toru Monitoring Station \( **S8**\). Also, in April 2019, the IUCN called for the adoption of a conservation management plan, for the designation of a further 8,000ha of the Bantang Toru Ecosystem as “Conservation Forest” to protect and extend the connecting corridors, and for a moratorium on any projects that might impact the habitat or viability of the Tapanuli orangutan \( **S9**\). 

######  Improvements in orangutan rehabilitation and release programmes in Malaysia 

 Sustaining orangutan populations also relies on successful rehabilitation\-release programmes. These programmes offer ex\-captive or displaced orangutans an opportunity to return to the wild. However, the overall mortality rate for released orangutans can be high \(Russon et al., 2009\), particularly as rehabilitant animals may have very different sets of skills due to early experiences in life. In 2011, following a number of unsuccessful orangutan rehabilitations, \[text removed for publication\] sought Davila Ross’ expertise on individual fitness\-related behaviours in great apes to improve release survival rates. Since 2014, Davila Ross visited \[text removed for publication\] on six occasions, using these opportunities for research collaboration, training and meetings with staff and wildlife authorities. 

 As a result, Davila Ross and \[text removed for publication\] co\-developed methods to measure individual characteristics of orangutans. In 2017, these were incorporated into decisions taken by \[text removed for publication\] to select five release candidates. Between August 2017 and May 2019, Davila Ross trained eight \[text removed for publication\] staff to systematically record individual survival skills and behaviours to assess individuals’ release potential and to identify areas where improvement in survival skills is needed. In 2018, and based on research led by Davila Ross, \[text removed for publication\] implemented a new programme of transitional release. The programme places rehabilitant individuals in a pre\-release site, where they can learn from their conspecifics prior to full release into the \[text removed for publication\] Wildlife Reserve. Released orangutans are then followed for a further year. Between April and September 2019, Davila Ross trained four \[text removed for publication\] staff in coding of orangutan behaviours and seven orangutans were released into the transitional site in May 2019. This system means that it is possible to determine, within a short time period and in a pre\-release setting, if the orangutans are ready for full release. According to the Wildlife Officer, \[text removed for publication\] ‘ *the new, softer release approach that considers the individual orangutan skill development helps to increase survival rates. Research undertaken with Dr Davila Ross has enabled us to introduce new policies and strategies that continue to improve release methods, reducing the risk of unsuccessful releases and ultimately reducing the likelihood of death for this critically endangered species’* \( **S10**\).

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers at the University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) invented the Effect Handler programming construct, and proved it to be a versatile, highly expressive programming abstraction. Companies worldwide have adopted Effect Handlers for software infrastructure, including GitHub, Uber and Facebook. Across these companies, Effect Handlers have brought commercial benefits ranging from improved developer productivity, in turn yielding more cost\-effective working practices \(for GitHub and Uber\); to increased product performance \(for Uber and Facebook\). Effect Handlers have been strategically important for the three companies, and ultimately benefit a diverse population of billions of end\-users, from developers collaborating on GitHub, to commercial and private users of Facebook’s underpinning software architecture, React.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Programming language researchers investigate new programming constructs, through programming language modelling, design, and implementation. Desirable properties of such constructs include the ability to make modular abstractions, allowing software development teams to scale and achieve larger goals; expressivity, enabling software to evolve alongside developer needs; and runtime efficiency, allowing software systems to scale to larger tasks and throughput. Over the last decade, researchers in the University of Edinburgh’s \(UoE\) Laboratory for the Foundations of Computer Science’s \(LFCS\) programming language group invented and implemented a modular control\-flow programming construct, the Effect Handler. In 2009, Professor Gordon Plotkin and his PhD student Dr Matija Pretnar presented an algebraic treatment of exception handlers, and introduced handlers for other computational effects representable by an algebraic theory \[3.1\]. In this formalism, programmers can define *effects* and invoke them to interrupt the program’s execution and invoke an appropriate handler code. However, unlike exception handlers, an Effect Handler can resume the original point of execution, sometimes repeatedly. Effect Handlers promise a highly modular and expressive programming style, and Plotkin and Pretnar gave a theoretical demonstration of their versatility \[3.1\]. 

 Subsequently, Dr Sam Lindley, Dr Nicolas Oury, and Dr Ohad Kammar \(then a UoE PhD student\) popularised Effect Handlers by giving simpler descriptions for them and demonstrating how to incorporate them into existing programming languages \[3.2\]. Effect Handlers were originally presented by Plotkin and Pretnar in a style that required considerable mathematical sophistication to understand, namely categorical algebra and denotational semantics. The researchers gave an operational description using a high\-level state machine. They also implemented Effect Handlers in existing programming languages \(Haskell, SML, OCaml, Lisp, Racket\), giving programmers and programming language researchers a hands\-on opportunity to learn about and experiment with them. 

 Lindley and Kammar explored the expressive power of Effect Handlers, and proved they are highly expressive \[3.4\]. These theoretical results make Effect Handlers a future\-proof programming abstraction. Moreover, this theoretical development incorporates several source\-to\-source translations that form the basis for the more practical work, including Lindley’s *continuation passing style* translations, which offer a practical implementation technique of effect handlers that does not require special support in a target language’s runtime \[3.3\]. 

 Lindley and his PhD student Daniel Hillerström showed how to implement Effect Handlers efficiently in web applications \[3.3\]. This technique formed the basis for the programming language OCaml’s run\-time for Effect Handlers, which Hillerström continued in a research internship at OCaml Labs Cambridge during his PhD. Lindley continued to develop implementation techniques and type systems for Effect Handlers with PhD students Hillerström \[3.5\] and Dr Craig McLaughlin \[3.6\]. 

 Plotkin, Lindley and Kammar led and grew the Effect Handlers research community and its ties with industry by participating and co\-organising international research meetings such as Dagstuhl \(\#16112 and \#18172\) and Shonan \(\#146\), attended by academic and industrial researchers.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The Effect Handlers abstraction has been adopted for software infrastructure by companies worldwide, contributing to their business strategy, enabling increased productivity, and leading to resource\-use efficiency improvements. Three notable companies – GitHub, Uber and Facebook – used Effect Handlers to benefit an exceptionally large number of users. 

 GitHub, Inc. hosts the largest collection of programming language source code repositories in the world. The company’s Semantic team develop code intelligence tools for semantic analysis, like semantic code navigation. Central to the code intelligence tools is an Effect Handler library that the GitHub team developed, underpinned by the core abstractions first developed by UoE \(3.1, 3.2\) \[5.1, para. 2\]. 

 Semantic’s Effect Handlers operate at scale, analysing thousands of pull\-requests per day, continuously \[5.1, para 1\]. Effect Handlers enable Semantic’s analysis tools to support multiple programming languages, giving these tools extraordinary reach. Semantic’s tools cover over 56% of the thousands of pull requests per day in these languages, across 100,000,000 repositories \[5.1, paras. 1, 4\]. This wide reach is only possible through supporting a diverse collection of languages, since each language covers under 25% of the total repositories on GitHub \[5.1, para. 1\]. Moreover, the support enabled by Effect Handlers is unusually cost\-effective: the Semantic team confirm they can “offer \[their\] users a service that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive \[...keeping\] development and maintenance costs remarkably low”, with only 8 developers on the team. Effect Handlers also give GitHub a strategic advantage, as they confirm that “a future\-proof Effect Handlers library contributes to GitHub’s long\-term strategy for offering code intelligence products ‘out of the box’” \[5.1, paras. 4\-5\]. 

 Effect Handlers are central to these benefits. Analysing a language involves controlling a combinatorial explosion of thousands of subtle inter\-related parameters. The company confirms: 

 *Without a modular abstraction like Effect Handlers, we would likely need a dedicated team for each combination of language and analysis parameters, rendering the endeavour too costly.* \[5.1, para. 4\] 

 With Effect Handlers, a small development suffices. The strategic advantage, future\-proofing the product, is one of the Effect Handler library’s design goals, “making it easy to add new languages as well as new analyses in order to support more advanced language features.” \[5.1, para. 4\] 

 Uber Technologies, Inc. provides a diverse number of services from vehicles for hire to food and package delivery. It operates the largest ride\-hailing platform in the world. Uber faces many machine\-learning problems, involving large amounts of data. In 2017, grounded in their desire to advance the state of the art in machine intelligence, Uber released the Pyro open\-source programming language embodying how they “believe statistical modelling should be done” \[5.2, para. 2\] *.* 

 Uber used Pyro to debug, prototype and automate statistical modelling pipelines, freeing staff from having to constantly monitor and maintain these systems manually, avoiding wastage of dollars \[5.2, para. 6\]. The production system requires very little oversight, enabling teams to focus on higher level strategy and execution instead of repetitive monitoring tasks. Uber credits Effect Handlers with enabling these benefits from Pyro. They note that implementing a system like Pyro without Effect Handlers would have been impractical due to code duplication, resulting in many bugs \[5.2, para. 5\]. Effect Handlers allow modellers to change inference algorithms with low effort, without changes to the model. For example, Pyro’s conjugate marginalisation Effect Handler “led to a 10x faster performance than comparable models in Stan – the other principal industrial standard probabilistic programming language” \[5.2, para. 7\]. Pyro’s reference manual \[5.3, final page\] refers readers directly to University of Edinburgh’s underpinning research \(3.1, 3.2\). This library lets users “answer complex questions with minimal additional code.” \[5.2, para. 5\] The modularity of Pyro, achieved through Effect Handlers, future\-proofs these statistical pipelines, which is “an important strategic consideration” for Uber \[5.2, para. 7\]. 

 One concrete success story at Uber is a Pyro model deployed at scale in advertising budget allocation, running automatically, continually, and daily. This marketing problem is strategically important for Uber due to marketing’s direct contribution to the vitality of their ride hailing platform and the company’s global volume of operation: Uber works in approximately 10,000 cities across 69 countries \[5.2, paras. 2 and 8\]. The company’s total marketing and sales budget in 2019 was USD4,600,000,000 \(09\-2020\), a USD1,500,000,000 \(09\-2020\) increase from 2018. Even a 1% increase in return on advertising spend translates into millions of US dollars per annum \[5.2, para. 8\]. Uber confirms: 

 *Pyro has more than delivered on its promise of making probabilistic modelling and inference easier, and these models have been used by the marketing team to manage important campaigns.* \[5.2, para. 8\] 

 Facebook, Inc. forms the largest social media conglomerate corporation in the world, developing and maintaining multiple social media platforms reaching billions of users. Key products include the Facebook app \(more than 2,000,000,000 users\), Messenger, and Instagram \(more than 1,000,000,000 users, each\). The user\-interface in these platforms is based on the Facebook’s React JavaScript library \[5.4, para. 1\]. 

 React used Effect Handlers in the design of its API, in the form of two new programming concepts: Hooks and Suspense. Both make user\-interface code simpler and cheaper to develop and extend, and the user interface more reactive. Facebook has made using Hooks mandatory across its codebase, including its influential Messenger and Instagram platforms, and most notably in the website design for the Facebook platform \[5.4, paras. 6\-8\]. Moreover, React is a popular library outside Facebook, with 2,000,000 active developers worldwide \[5.4, para. 1\]. It is widely adopted across diverse business sectors by companies such as Twitter, Airbnb, Uber, Dropbox, Microsoft Office, online education platforms Khan Academy and Codecademy, and news outlets such as the New York Times and the BBC \[5.4, para. 2\]. A recent survey conducted in the React community showed that 70% of respondents prefer to use Hooks, and only 7% prefer not to use them, and that 50% use Hooks in production \[5.4, para. 9\]. Hooks have been adopted as the new industry\-standard for web user\-interface design, with all competing frameworks directly referencing Hooks as a feature they want to support \[5.5\-5.8\]. 

 The React team relies on the expressivity and compositionality of Effect Handlers to future\-proof their API design, describing the UoE programming construct as “strategically important” \[5.4, penultimate para.\]. They credit Effect Handlers with enabling improvements to React’s compositionality, and also state: 

 *Effect Handlers are an expressive concept based on rigorous mathematical models. These properties give us further assurance that they will continue to deliver flexible designs and utilise resources efficiently as our needs develop, allowing us to make more informed strategic decisions today.* \[5.4, penultimate para.\] 

 React developers attribute these benefits directly to the UoE research, citing Effect Handlers as a “key concept inspiring the current design of the React API” \[5.4, final para.\]. Their documentation references Multicore OCaml’s algebraic effects \[5.9, final para.\], an implementation of Effect Handlers derived from UoE’s underpinning research \(3.1\-3.3\). Facebook concludes: 

 *The React ecosystem — the largest on the web — has widely embraced this Effect\-Handler\-based design, and it is used in production code in an essential way.* \[5.4, final para.\] 

 Overall, Effect Handlers underpin technologies used by companies across the software industry, reaching billions of users and clients daily. The programming construct developed at UoE has improved production efficiency, and empowered teams to develop clean, flexible, and expressive code. Effect Handlers has enabled companies to provide future\-proof products and services, and drives strategic decision\-making.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 “Buildings as power stations” \(BAPS\) is a revolutionary concept by which buildings go beyond self\-sufficiency and integrate into local and national energy infrastructure to share energy loading and become net contributors to national energy demands. The underpinning research conducted at Swansea University \(SU\) resulted in the construction and operation of energy\-positive buildings \(the Active Classroom and Active Office\), leading to the generation of 1MWh p.a. of green energy. Direct economic impact was achieved off the back of these buildings resulting in a GBP36,000,000 EPSRC investment into the national delivery of energy positive buildings which created the Active Building Centre \(ABC\), a new and independent Research and Technology Organisation \(RTO\).  An additional economic impact was achieved with GBP5,000,000 of private sector investment into the commercial development of BAPS technology.  The BAPS principles have also been applied to 12 social housing dwellings, removing 12 families from fuel poverty and invoking Welsh Government policy debate on the future of all new build homes in Wales being powered by clean energy. International social impact through technology transfer to India has also been achieved, improving the health and wellbeing of communities within this developing nation through improved energy security. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The BAPS concept is a result of SU’s extensive underpinning research in novel functional coatings.  The concept is based on the premise that smart materials and integrated systems built into the fabric of the building are able to harvest, store and use zero carbon energy such that the building becomes a net contributor, as opposed to a net burden, to the national power grid. This vision has been championed by the EPSRC, Innovate UK and the Welsh Government, which enabled the creation of the Sustainable Product Engineering Centre for Innovative Functional Industrial Coatings \(SPECIFIC\) Innovation Knowledge Centre \(IKC\) at Swansea in 2011. SPECIFIC contains 10 academic staff and over 50 postdoctoral and postgraduate researchers, who undertake a wide breadth of research to enable the BAPS vision, ranging from fundamental photochemistry and large area photovoltaic \(PV\) design to thermal modelling and monitoring of buildings. 

 Pre\-painted steel building facades can be subject to UV paint degradation and steel corrosion, limiting their life and suitability as solar energy harvesting surfaces. Our research on understanding the relationship between the paint spectral absorption characteristics **\[R1\]**, paint binder and pigment photochemical stability **\[R2\]** and cut edge corrosion of zinc\-coated steel **\[R3\]** has resulted in functionalization of the building structure. Our research has enabled and demonstrated energy absorbing photo\-stable full façade transpired solar collectors \(TSC\) which act as both a protective skin on a building and a source of 60°C hot air for building heating or thermal storage. 

 In order to address the temporal mismatch between the high supply of hot air from the TSC in the summer and the high demand in winter, thermal storage solutions were investigated by Swansea. The hydration of salts was identified as a suitable thermochemical storage mechanism, appropriate to temperatures achievable directly from the building envelope. This research was critical for the implementation of the active buildings concept **\[R4\]**. 

 In parallel with thermal capture, our research has enabled innovation in electrical harvesting, storage and use. Based on our fundamental material and device research into scalable manufacturing of perovskite photovoltaics, we have developed a process for the production of the world’s largest low\-cost \(<GBP0.05/KWh\) printable PV modules **\[R5\]**, using low\-energy manufacturing methods. Our research on binder / solvent formulation, carbon type and processing conditions of conductive carbon pastes has enabled thermal uplift through low voltage underfloor heating which is localised and controlled at individual tile “pixel” level **\[R6\]**, for highly localized workspace heating from any stored excess PV power. This marries well to heat release from thermochemical storage to provide individual workspace comfort. 

 In reference to everything above, SU’s research was amalgamated into a functioning system. A variety of novel electrical and thermal energy harvesting, energy storage and consumption technologies were integrated into the building fabric and building management system for the first time. Each fully instrumented building delivers unique human\-building interaction metrics to test the novel technologies. These buildings are functioning with normal occupancy rates and are providing net energy contributions to the grid. Our research was critical in enabling a substantial body of work that dictated the design and build of the Active Office and Active Classroom. These innovations were recognised by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Wales in shortlisting the buildings for multiple awards and winning two, the “Sustainable Building of the Year in 2017” award and subsequently a “Design through Innovation 2018” award.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Utilising the underpinning research strands outlined above, SPECIFIC IKC have taken these siloed green technologies and combined them into a fully integrated system for the first time.  This culminated in the delivery of real buildings that address both the practical implementation and the technical challenges of BAPS. 

 Ground\-breaking scalable research on the system control, material properties and reactor design have enabled the first scale\-up from laboratory reactor to a 5\-tonne calcium chloride thermal storage reactor. The storage reactor was deployed in a factory\-size building which was retrofitted with a TSC as a thermal source, and the building has operated for 3 years without fossil fuels achieving storage densities of 56kWh/m<sup>3</sup>. 

 On the Swansea University Bay Campus over 4 annual cycles \(between 2017 and 2020\) under full occupancy, the Active Classroom \(186m2\) has delivered a net positive energy generation of 400kWh per annum. In addition, in its first year of operation \(between July 2018 and 2019\) the Active Office \(376m2\) reduced its net energy consumption by 99% \(4 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> per annum\), compared to an industry standard of 300 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> per annum for a conventional office. By the end of June 2020, optimization led to a net positive 600 kWh per annum energy production, **making it the UK’s first energy\-positive office space**. Six electric vehicle charging points on the buildings have also provided 29,000km of fossil fuel\-free motoring. Since construction, these buildings had a direct positive **environmental** **impact** by removing reliance on fossil fuels, reducing carbon emissions by an estimated 70 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> \(compared to an office built to current national standards\) as well as providing green energy back into the national grid at times of peak demand. 



 **Economic impact** has been derived from the research. The buildings have been critical in creating the case for large national and international collaborations on BAPS. A GBP36,000,000 EPSRC investment was made into the new independent Active Building Centre \(ABC\) Research and Technology Organisation \(RTO\) **\[C1\]**. The creation of the ABC RTO was reliant upon Swansea’s research, as affirmed by the CEO of ABC: 

 *“…the demonstration buildings designed, specified and delivered on the University campus were a catalyst for change that inspired the investment to create the ABC.”* **\[C1\]**. 

 The technology used in the buildings has since been transferred to the industrial mass market through the new ABC RTO via best practice guidelines, and has invoked industrial support with collaboration across the building value chain, from 21 leading industry bodies who are committed to meet the governmental initiative to make all new buildings 100% zero carbon by 2030 **\[C2\]**. 

 Companies such as Wernick Buildings within the construction sector and Naked Energy, a Small to Medium Enterprise \(SME\) that develops photovoltaic thermal \(PVT\) collectors, have both directly benefited from Swansea’s active building projects. Build partner Wernick states: 

 *“The process of developing the Active Office was a significant technical advance for the company, opening new commercial possibilities in architecturally inspired buildings.”* Deputy Managing Director, Wernick Buildings Ltd **\[C3\]**. 

 In addition, Naked Energy’s ground\-breaking PVT installation on the vertical facia of the Active Office allowed the company’s first quantifiable demonstration, which resulted in them securing a GBP5,000,000 private investment into scaling manufacture of their PVT products for the construction industry **\[C4\]**. 

 Direct **social impact** has also been affected through the design and construction of energy\-positive social housing in the Active Homes 12\-dwelling estate in Neath, South Wales, which represents a multi\-partner collaboration with social housing provider. The CEO of The Active Building Centre emphasises the **health and wellbeing** **benefit** of these homes: 

 *“We are particularly pleased that the 12 Active Homes in Neath will be occupied in the late summer of 2020 and that these 12 novel homes will provide heat and power to occupants who would otherwise be in fuel poverty.”* **\[C1\]**. 

 The benefits derived from this concept have also influenced **Welsh Government Policy** debate, invoking a consultation \(as a preliminary to legislative policy\) that all Welsh new\-build homes must be powered from clean energy sources by 2025 **\[C5 & C6\]**. 

 Beyond the UK, Swansea’s active building research is having impact within developing nations such as India, where energy security is one of many significant societal issues due to limited and unreliable supply. The SUNRISE project \(2020 winner of the Times Higher Education Award for International Collaboration\), which aims to address global energy poverty by implementing next generation TSCs and large area low cost PV technologies, has used sustainable  building principles generated from our research to provide secure energy supplies to community schools and health centres in rural India. Through our delivery partner The Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, **impacts on** **learning and participation** have been derived from the 1.92kW microgrid and battery installation at Panchaya Union School in Tirupur, Tamilnadu, which has benefitted the school and its pupils by providing lighting for an additional 3 hours of learning time per day. In addition, a 5.12kW microgrid was installed in the Primary Health Centre in Dharwad, Karnataka, **benefiting the wellbeing and health** of the local community through a new stable, green electrical supply **\[C7\]**. This energy security intervention allowed the health centre to maintain its services and function effectively without the risk of power loss. Impact on **energy poverty** in Africa is evidenced by Solar Powered classroom/play area in Mutende Orphange, Chingola, Zambia \(installed 2016\) and an independent school power supply in Siavonga, Zambia \(installed 2019\). 

 Our research has also formed the basis for Continued Professional Development \(CPD\) training, where our technology advances and best practices in BAPS have been widely disseminated throughout industry. National recognition of SPECIFIC’s leadership in this area resulted in our CPD content being used to formulate a national framework to influence building standards, new design guidelines and codes of practice. The Royal Institute of British Architects CPD programme, which was begun in 2019, now includes the SPECIFIC Active Building workshops which have   educated and inspired 271 professionals \(to end of Jan 2020\) from a wide range of industries including the MoD and the NHS and is a continuous ongoing activity **\[C8\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professors Dasgupta and Coyle, Dr Agarwala and the Wealth Economy team at Cambridge lead a global movement looking beyond gross domestic product \(GDP\) to determine how an economy can prosper sustainably, without sacrificing the natural environment or the future health and wellbeing of its people. Their Inclusive Wealth Framework, developed by Dasgupta in the early 2000’s, provides the theoretical foundation for the practical calculation of sustainable development indicators seen in the United Nations’ \(UN’s\) Inclusive Wealth reports \(2012, 2014, 2018\). It underpins India’s Green National Accounts \(2018 onwards\) that seek to reshape government decision\-making for a ‘better environment, better tomorrow’. Their research has enabled the UN statistics division to account for changes in ecosystems such as air purification, with a direct effect on human health. Their social capital metric supports the Industrial Strategy Council \(2019 onwards\) in evaluating how policy and economic change affect public trust.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 GDP growth has been the overarching goal of economic policy for over 70 years. Whilst material gains have been substantial, they have been accompanied by unprecedented environmental and social change, the consequences of which threaten to wipe out a century of gains. It is a fact widely acknowledged that GDP is a useful, but insufficient measure of economic prosperity. Research by Professors Dasgupta and Coyle, Dr Agarwala and the Wealth Economy team at Cambridge provides a pathway for local and national governments, and international institutions, to move beyond GDP and adopt new frameworks that emphasise a society’s wealth and wellbeing \(rather than its income\) and to develop new measures that account for “missing” capital stocks, in particular natural and social capital. 

 Professor Dasgupta’s welfare economics research on Inclusive \(also called Comprehensive\) Wealth from the early 2000’s **\[R1, R2\]** provides the theoretical foundation for placing human wellbeing, and natural, social, and human capital at the centre of economic statistics. His research at Cambridge shows why the most relevant welfare metric should be wealth and not income, and why the wealth measure must be inclusive and capture not only reproducible and human capital but also natural capital, health improvements and technological change. Inclusive wealth can be measured as a linear index of the economy’s capital stocks. A key theoretical result **\[R2\]** is that changes in Inclusive Wealth have direct consequences for welfare and sustainability. The theory provides a practical wealth management rule for delivering sustainability: Inclusive Wealth must be non\-declining for intertemporal social welfare to be preserved over time. This Inclusive Wealth Framework provides the conceptual cornerstone for the development of new measurement frameworks that can guide policy, as demonstrated in Dasgupta’s 2012 paper **\[R3\]**. The framework not only demonstrates what should be measured from a welfare theoretical point of view, but it offers general guidance on how the theory can be translated into practical metrics for guiding policy and measuring sustainability. 

 Professor Coyle’s research since 2018 at Cambridge **\[R4; R5\]** translates the theory **\[R2; R3\]** into directly applicable policy guidance. Under her leadership, the Wealth Economy team at Cambridge has shown the impact of natural capital mismanagement, and how these impacts can be valued and reflected in new official statistical standards, using research commissioned by the UK Government and the United Nations \(UN\). **\[R6\]** places Dr Agarwala’s 2019 framework within the nexus of food\-water\-governance, showing how the wealth approach can generate real\-world agricultural management improvements. **\[R7; R8\]** form part of the Cambridge Wealth Economy team’s contributions to the development of the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounts \(SEEA\). Dr Agarwala demonstrates **\[R8\]** how the SEEA can be used by Finance Ministries and Central Banks for direct integration with the standard macroeconomic models in use by national governments around the world and **\[R7\]** shows how air filtration ecosystem services can be integrated into the SEEA. Professor Coyle outlines **\[R4; R5\]** how GDP\-oriented measures increase inequality, and how changing HM Treasury rules on Cost\-Benefit valuation can lead to greater investment in those who are ‘left\-behind’ to improve human wellbeing and reduce inequality. This research shows how tangible measures of trust and social capital can be used to evaluate policy and help explain the ‘productivity puzzle’ facing many developed economies.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Professors Dasgupta and Coyle, Dr Agarwala and the Wealth Economy team at Cambridge lead a global revolution in thinking about Inclusive Wealth which has a profound effect on policy making across the world. The impact of the research is evidenced by the widespread adoption by policymakers of the frameworks they developed to conceptualize and to measure Inclusive Wealth. By the end of the REF period, at least 69 countries had implemented the United Nations System of Environmental Economic Accounting \(SEEA\), and a further 22 were planning to do so **\[S1\]**. Adoption of Inclusive Wealth measures help governments to avoid short\-term policy biases and to promote sustainable development. 

 *‘Professor Dasgupta’s research provided the economic theory underlying the landmark UN Inclusive Wealth Reports* \[2012, 2014 and 2018\] *for which he served as Chief Scientific Advisor.’* **\[S2\]**. His Inclusive Wealth Framework **\[R2, R3\]** provides the theoretical foundation for the practical calculation of sustainable development indicators and is replicated in the foreword to the ‘Inclusive Wealth Report’ 2018 **\[S3**, pp V\-X \(Roman\) **\]**. These reports estimate Inclusive Wealth, including human and natural capital, across the world. They demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate a country’s progress towards achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The Chief Environmental Economist at the Ecosystems Division of the UN Environment Programme states that *“We are now better able to measure the stock of each of these capitals, are developing official statistical standards for countries to report changes in wealth, and will continue to use the wealth framework in pursuit of our mission and in delivering the 2030 Agenda”* **\[S2\]** and the Chief of the Environmental\-Economic Accounts Division says that “ *the development of natural capital accounts is closely linked to the theory of Inclusive Wealth developed by Professor Dasgupta.*” **\[S4\]**. 

 Dr Agarwala has worked with the UN Statistics Division \(UNSD\) since 2019 to develop a process to value air filtration ecosystem services within the United Nations System of Environmental Economic Accounting – Experimental Ecosystem Accounts \(SEEA\-EEA\), paving the way for the framework to be adopted as a statistical standard in 2021 **\[R7\]**. Air purification improves human health, which boosts labour productivity, improves quality of life, and reduces healthcare costs. The Chief of Environmental Economic Accounts at the UN states that this *“work is directly linked to the pressure of economic activities on the environment in terms of air emissions captured in the air emission accounts.”* **\[S4\]**. Dr Agarwala and the Wealth Economy team **\[R8\]** have *“provided convincing arguments describing why the SEEA Central Framework and SEEA Ecosystem Accounts are important to macroeconomic decision\-makers, particularly in finance ministries, central banks, and investors…This … demonstrates that the SEEA system of accounts is needed in economic, as well as environmental policy making.”* **\[S4\]**. 

 Professor Dasgupta chaired the high\-level  [Expert Group convened by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation \(MOSPI\)](https://seea.un.org/content/natural-capital-accounting-and-valuation-ecosystem-services-india), Government of India, to design a framework for green national accounts in India. The Expert Group published its report in 2013 which included a roadmap for implementing the Green Accounting Framework and recommended that economic evaluation be based on Dasgupta’s *Inclusive Wealth Framework* **\[R2, R3\]**. The 2018 publication from MOSPI, ‘Envistats\-India’ is explicit about the intention to “ *provide the technical ‘push’ to public policy imperatives in India, so that environmental information is mainstreamed to reshape government decision\-making for a “better environment, better tomorrow*” **\[S5** \(2018\) pX \(Roman\), paragraph 25 **\]**. All recommendations made by Dasgupta’s Expert Group were accepted by the Government of India and can be seen in the 2019 Envistats\-India report **\[S5** \(2019\) p3, paragraph 5 **\]**. 

 In 2018, Professor Coyle was appointed to the UK’s Industrial Strategy Council, an independent body set up to assess the UK Government’s Industrial Strategy. In October 2019, the Wealth Economy team’s measurement of social capital and trust was selected as one of the six ‘Headline Outcomes’ by the Council **\[S6\]**. This metric facilitates improvement in policy design by supporting the Council in evaluating how policy and economic change affect trust. The Head of Research at the Industrial Strategy Council is explicit about the role of the Cambridge Wealth Economy Team: *“The metrics identified by Dr Agarwala, with their robust theoretical backing, are now being used as part of the Council’s success metrics...and will inform the Council’s evaluation.”* **\[S7\]**. 

 Professor Coyle “ *trailblazed*” **\[S8\]** a new local industrial strategy when she chaired the Greater Manchester Independent Prosperity Review \(IPR\) from 2018 to 2019. Building on **\[R5; R6\]**, this culminated in March 2019 with the ‘Reviewers’ Report’ **\[S9\]**. The IPR analysis was accepted, in its entirety, by HM Treasury in June 2019, and provided the intellectual case for subsequent governance reforms. The Chief Economic Advisor to the Greater Manchester Combined Authority views *“Prof. Coyle’s contribution to the IPR to be an exemplary demonstration of the way in which specialised academic excellence and the credibility it can bring can be mobilised effectively to influence public policy and practice.”* **\[S8\]**. Professor Coyle also served as a Commissioner on the Cambridge and Peterborough Independent Economic Review until this concluded in September 2018. One of the founders of ‘Cambridge Ahead’ attests that Professor Coyle’s impact on the review’s thinking on measurement of natural capital was of the “ *highest importance.*” **\[S10\]**. 

 Professors Dasgupta and Coyle, Dr Agarwala and the Wealth Economy team’s research on Inclusive Wealth has profound ongoing effects on policy making in the UK. In March 2019, HM Treasury announced that Professor Dasgupta would lead a major assessment of the economic value of biodiversity **\[S11\]**. The \(interim\) Dasgupta Review was published in April 2020 and is due to be presented at the delayed meeting of the  [UN Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity](https://www.cbd.int/meetings/COP-15) in May 2021. The Wealth Economy team at Cambridge is working with the Office for National Statistics on incorporating ‘missing capitals’ such as social capital into official statistics **\[S12\]**. Lastly, Professor Coyle contributed **\[R4\]** to a review of the HM Treasury Green Book  [published in November 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/final-report-of-the-2020-green-book-review). *“Combined, the works of Professor Dasgupta, Professor Coyle, and Dr. Agarwala provide the economic rationale for moving Beyond GDP. Their work has highlighted the need for balanced investment in all components of wealth – natural, human, physical, and social capital – and crucially, the interdependencies between them.”* **\[S2\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Governments acquire much information on businesses and people. Re\-using this information for research brings substantial public benefit in the form of better health care, improved policy\-making and better services. Where the data is confidential \(for example, healthcare or tax receipts\), its value is not fully realised because governments are generally wary about re\-use. Work conducted by UWE researchers has dramatically changed the way the public sector exploits data by: 

-  changing attitudes to risk; 

-  developing statistical and management tools to improve implementation; and 

-  providing a universal framework for managing data. 

 UWE’s research has been accepted as best practice in many countries, including the UK, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and the UK, the ‘Five Safes’ framework has directly shaped primary legislation. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The theory around re\-use of confidential government data for analysis has historically been very cautious, driven by fear of mistakes rather than a desire to maximise value. Research was commissioned and promoted by statistical agencies and focused on the risk of using confidential data to produce aggregate statistics such as inflation or crime figures. UWE research has developed and challenged this by: 

-  showing how different attitudes to risk around data governance can significantly affect outcomes; 

-  developing new statistical and management tools and the theory and evidence to justify them; 

-  providing a standard framework for risk management – the ‘Five Safes’. 

 **Changing attitudes – a new conceptual model**Governments are encouraged to be defensive when considering re\-use of confidential data. This leads to outcomes designed to minimise risk to the data holder. UWE research identified that this leads to sub\-optimal outcomes and inefficient decision\-making. The research recommended that: problems be considered from the user’s perspective, not the data owner’s; that credible evidence be the basis of decision making, not hypothetical ‘worst\-case scenarios’; and that governments should be ‘default open’ – using data unless there is a compelling reason against it. This leads to risk management, not minimisation, and acknowledges the wider gains to society. UWE research showed how this leads to more efficient outcomes, both in theory \( **R1, R2**\) and in applied work \( **R3, R4, R5, G1**\). 

 This radically different agenda was first presented in 2014 \( **R1**\), and has now evolved into the epistemological perspective called the EDRU \(Evidence\-based, Default\-open, Risk\-managed, User\-centred\) approach \( **G2, R5**\). This is characterised by the question “what are we trying to achieve and how do we do it best?” rather than the traditional “what are we allowed to do?” 

 The EDRU approach is less dogmatic in its approach to risk management, causing problems for the rules\-based processes used to regulate data access. The UWE team demonstrated that effective regulation is better achieved by ‘principles\-based’ regulation matched to accreditation processes, rather than rigid rules. Together, the EDRU approach to decision\-making and the principles\-based approach to objective\-setting form the ‘UWE model’. 

 **New statistical and operational tools**Before our work, almost all government research data access was based upon rules designed for the production of official statistics by organisations such as the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\). The literature was dominated by statisticians proposing technical measures to preserve confidentiality and IT literature focusing on hacking attacks. We found this was inappropriate for research purposes. As a result, UWE researchers developed tools or guidelines for all aspects of the research data process: the best way to train researchers \( **G3, G4**\); dealing with ‘impossible’ risks; anonymising datasets for research use \( **G1,** **R5**\); and cost\-effective delivery mechanisms **\(G5,** **R2**\). 

 For example, statistical disclosure control \(SDC\) is a major research field in statistics, concerned with the risk that statistical outputs may inadvertently disclose some confidential information about an individual. We were the first to demonstrate in research papers that SDC rules for official statistics are wasteful, ineffective and unsafe when applied to research outputs. An entirely new field of ‘output SDC’ was proposed which incorporated previous research as a special case. This new perspective led to new operational theory \( **R3**\) and new statistical theory \( **R4**\). 

 **The ‘Five Safes’ framework**Professor Ritchie devised the Five Safes framework as a way of describing data management choices \( **R6**\). This sees effective use of data for research as a problem of managing five dimensions: the project; the people; the setting; the data and the outputs. The Five Safes integrates statistical, ethical, managerial and behavioural perspectives into a single coherent framework that can be applied to any confidential data management problem. 

 This also helped structure research by the group. It was clear that most research in each of the Five Safes was siloed and did not follow EDRU principles. Accordingly, our research programme was developed to address the methodological and technical gaps in each of the elements. 

 Together these three elements \(conceptual model, specific tools, ‘Five Safes’ framework\) have created an integrated research programme which have changed the way that confidential data management is perceived.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Changing attitudes to risk** Prior to this research, public sector organisations paid lip service to improving data access, but in practice followed models based on a defensive methodology that discouraged innovation. 

 UWE research provided the organisations with a new conceptual framework and the research evidence to support new ways of thinking about data access. This approach is popular because it generally leads to outcomes with lower costs but better data protection and user satisfaction. 

 The broad messages of the Evidence\-based, Default\-open, Risk\-managed, User\-centred model \(EDRU\) are increasingly accepted as best practice in public sector organisations, and in international meetings on confidentiality, such as those organised by Eurostat \( **S1**\) **.** The value of the research to organisations is widely recognised. A Principal Information Development Manager at Public Health Scotland noted that: ‘ *Felix’s research has been influential in changing mind\-sets across the board’* \( **S2**\). Whilst a Data Integration Partnership manager for the Australian Bureau of Statistics \(ABS\) revealed that: 

 *‘The ABS has moved away from being a 'default closed' to a 'default open' organisation. Felix's research has allowed us to reassure the public and other government agencies that data is being handled, shared and distributed in a safe and effective way…Moving from a data\-centred to a user\-centred approach marks a considerable change in attitudes in our organisation's data focused mindset’* \( **S3**\). 

 The principles\-based approach to regulation has been increasingly influential with lawmakers. This approach underlies the GDPR, and both the UK \(the Digital Economy Act 2017\) \( **S4**\) and Australia \(2020\) have introduced primary legislation which is explicitly principles\-based and founded on UWE work: 

 *‘Our Bill is a full implementation of a principles\-based approach to data sharing…Felix’s approach has become the standard method of viewing the sharing of data in the Australian Government’* \( **S5**\). 

 **Developing statistical and operational tools**UWE researchers have trained users and managers of confidential data. We have been repeatedly commissioned by the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) and Eurostat to develop courses, and have advised statistics offices in Canada, Mexico, Germany, New Zealand and Australia. Training based on UWE’s user\-centred model has been replicated around the world \( **S3**\) and seen as an exemplar: ‘ *The training courses he’s \[Professor Felix Ritchie\] helped develop are…widely accepted as the gold standard for researchers hoping to get accreditation’* \( **S4**\). 

 Research using confidential data must be checked for confidentiality risks before being released for publication. UWE research on the statistical issues directly translates into output checking guidelines \( **S1**, **S6**\) in most OECD countries, irrespective of whether those countries use the rest of the UWE model. UWE researchers provide guidance and training to all the UK secure research facilities. UWE research into operational issues has also had a substantial impact, with principles\-based output checking being adopted across the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, Norway, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. 

 *‘We have similarly made amendments to our disclosure control policies in accordance with Felix’s research. We have developed check lists and procedures for both us, as outputs checkers, and for researchers to use’* \( **S2**\). 

 **Adoption of the Five Safes framework** The Five Safes is increasingly common across the world. It is particularly popular with ‘data enclaves’ \(secure facilities for more confidential data\) such as those run by the Bundesbank, the European Central Bank, Eurostat, and the statistical offices of a number of European countries, as well as in Australia \( **S7, S8**\) and New Zealand \( **S9**\). 

 In the UK, organisations such as the ONS, UKRI, NHS Digital, NHS Scotland, and Cancer Research UK, among others, all now explicitly use the Five Safes to define their data access policies. The ONS won the 2017 Cyber Security award for its implementation \( **S4**\). The Digital Economy Act 2017 means that all UK government data sharing for research is effectively required to use the Five Safes. According to the Deputy Director for Research Services and Data Access at the ONS: 

 *‘Felix’s design of the ‘Five Safes’ framework has played a hugely significant role with regards to the secure sharing of data both in the UK and across the world…Felix’s creation of the Five Safes has demystified the way data is used. One of the strengths of Felix’s research has been to take a dry and technical concept and make it accessible whilst also reassuring’* \( **S4**\). 

 The same source also noted the impact on data sharing during Covid\-19, with the Five Safes crucial in making the ONS’s weekly Covid Infection Study possible. The work with the Joint Biosecurity Centre, the sharing of ’Track and Trace’ statistics from the Department for Health and Social Care, data acquired in one place from multiple sources ‘… *all of this made possible in the context of Felix’s Five Safes’* \( **S4**\). 

 The Australian Bureau of Statistics \(ABS\) adopted the Five Safes in 2015, after being heavily criticised for their data management in 2014, and coming across the UWE research in search of a solution \( **S3**\). After its successful adoption by ABS and the Australian Department of Social Services, private sector organisations and universities in Australia increasingly used it. The 2017 government sponsored Productivity Commission report \( **S10**\) recommended wholesale adoption of the UWE model across all of government, including the Five Safes. The bill implementing this is now making its way through the Australian parliament. According to the Acting National Data Commissioner in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet: 

 *‘Felix's work has formed the cornerstone of a key Australian Government reform agenda which is to be enshrined in legislation. His work has captured the attention of key decision makers, who are now familiar with the Five Safes approach. Taken together, I can give no stronger endorsement of the relevance and importance of Felix's work to us’* \( **S5**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study concerns the impact of research undertaken by David Albert Jones, Trevor Stammers and Pia Matthews who are members of the Centre for Bioethics and Emerging Technologies \(CBET\). It focuses on the issue of assisted dying, which is a lens for overlapping research on suicide, mental illness, disability, and human dignity as well as research specifically on euthanasia and physician assisted suicide. This research has: Influenced parliamentary debates over the legalisation of assisted dying in the United Kingdom Parliament and the Scottish Parliament; contributed to similar discussions in Germany, Canada, New Zealand and Australia; provided evidence to inform for public debate in the news media; and shaped the resources used by the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales in respect of the issue of ‘dying well’. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Jones was appointed lecturer at St Mary’s in 2002 and Stammers in 2006. In 2008 Jones and Stammers were founder\-members of CBET. Matthews joined CBET in 2009. Jones became director of the Anscombe Bioethics Centre in Oxford in 2010 and was re\-employed by St Mary’s from 2013. Jones, Stammers, and Matthews were included in St Mary’s submission to REF 2014 with Jones submitting a case study. Nevertheless, the present case study is not a “continued case study” as it includes new research since January 2014 and the impact described is distinct. 

 A key strand of the underpinning research is already contained in Jones’s monograph *Approaching the End* \(2007\) \( **3.1**\). Christian theological reflection on death embodies a paradox, in that while the Gospel offers hope of eternal life after death, the Church has consistently opposed the deliberate ending of human life \(with limited exceptions in the context of opposing injustice\). This paradox results from the simultaneous recognition of human life as an inviolable gift of God, to be respected, and of human death as an inherent limit imposed by God, to be accepted. The attempt to end one’s life is not only a failure to respect human life but also a failure to accept death as the limit, or horizon, of human power. 

 The argument made in favour of assisted dying concerns not only the meaning of human death but typically, and often primarily, a characterisation of life with disability and dependence on others as somehow lacking human dignity. Death is imagined to be preferable to life with disability. 

 To challenge this attitude Matthews has written extensively to develop a realistic, yet positive, approach to the consideration of people with disabilities in this discussion. This is informed by her experience as a parent of a daughter with profound, multiple, and complex disabilities. Her monographs *Pope John Paul II and the Apparently ‘Non\-acting’ Person*, \(2013\) \( **3.3**\), and *Discerning Persons Profound Disability, the Early Church Fathers and the Concept of the Person in Bioethics* \(2020\) \( **3.4**\) explore the concepts of person and dignity in the context of profound disability. 

 In November 2014, Jones and Stammers organised a conference on the impact on euthanasia on society, focusing on Belgium. Unable to attend this event but involved in the subsequent publication \( **3.5**\) was Kevin Fitzpatrick, philosopher, activist, and a founding commissioner of the Disability Rights Commission. Jones worked with Fitzpatrick and completed a book chapter by him after he died in 2016. Fitzpatrick argued that a visceral fear of loss of control may be experienced also by those who live successfully with disability. The circumstances of disability, mental illness and impending death are stressors that make people more vulnerable to suicidal thoughts but the challenge to find meaning in life and prevent suicide is one that is common to the human condition and not special to any group. 

 It is noteworthy that neither the practice of euthanasia in the Netherlands and Belgium, nor the practice of assisted suicide in Switzerland, is limited to people who are imminently dying. Euthanasia extends to people with physical disability or mental illness or, in a few cases, even to autism. These practices thus represent an existential threat to people who are disabled. There is also reason to think that acceptance of voluntary euthanasia implies acceptance of non\-voluntary euthanasia \( **3.2**\) and Belgium provides empirical evidence of this logic in practice \( **3.5**\). It is sometimes claimed that the current legal prohibition of assisted suicide may prompt suicide, as people sometimes end their lives earlier while they are still able. However, research by Jones has shown that legalising assisted suicide increases the total number of people dying by their own hand and does not reduce the level of unassisted suicide \( **3.6**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This research has been cited widely in the public debate concerning the issue of assisted suicide. The reach of the work is illustrated in the mention of it in newspaper coverage, not only in the United Kingdom \( **5.1a**\) but also in Germany, for example in *Frankfurter Allgemeine* Zeitung \( **5.1b**\) and in the United States of America, for example in the *LA Times*, and *Chicago Tribune*, as well as in Australia \( **5.1c\-e**\). 

 **Influence on parliamentary debate regarding assisted dying** 

 More specifically the work of this group has had a discernible impact on parliamentary debates concerning end of life care and assisted dying in several jurisdictions. If maintaining the law against assisted suicide is beneficial then clearly very many people have benefited from the work of Jones and of others at CBET. Furthermore, abstracting from the legislative outcome, the mention of the work of this group in the debate surrounding such legislative discussion has had a beneficial effect on the debate itself, by making high quality empirical evidence available to people. 

 <ins>U</ins><ins>nited Kingdom</ins> 

 During 2014 and 2015, Jones made submissions to the House of Commons Select Committee enquiry on end of life care \( **5.2a**\). He was also invited to give oral evidence by the Ministry of Justice in relation to coroners’ determinations of suicide \( **5.2b\-c**\). Jones contributed further to the debate in England and Wales in 2015 by producing an online guide to the evidence of the impact of assisted dying legislation, which was sent to all MPs \( **5.2d**\). Jones was then invited to address MPs from five political parties in Portcullis House \(Westminster\) prior to the vote \( **5.3**\). On 5 September 2015 Stammers had an article published in the *Spectator* which drew on personal experience, as well as clinical and academic knowledge. On the morning of the vote, Jones had letters published both in *The Independent* and *The Telegraph* arguing, based on his research, against the Bill \( **5.1a**\). The Bill was defeated in the House of Commons on 11 September 2015 by 330 votes to 118.  After the vote, Jones received a letter from Fiona Bruce MP, chair of the all\-party group that was opposing the Bill thanking him for “the important work you did towards the defeat of the Assisted Dying \(No 2\) Bill” \( **5.4**\). 

 <ins>Scotland</ins> 

 On behalf of The Anscombe Bioethics Centre, Jones made a submission to the Health and Sport Committee in relation to the Assisted Suicide \(Scotland\) Bill \( **5.5a**\). Jones presented oral evidence to the Committee in relation to this Bill at the 2nd Meeting, 2015 \(Session 4\), Tuesday 20 January 2015 \( **5.5b**, p.58\). His views were quoted verbatim in the report produced by the Committee on five occasions: on the issue of respect for autonomy \( **5.5b**, p.13\); on withdrawal/refusal of life\-sustaining treatment \( **5.5b**, p.17\); on coercion \( **5.5b**, p.31\); on informing patients of their treatment options \( **5.5b**, p.33\); and on the lack of clarity about the role of facilitators \( **5.5b**, p.39\). The BBC reported that the final view of the Committee was that ‘the bill contained ""significant flaws"" and opposed its general principles’ \( **5.5c**\). The written and oral evidence presented by Jones to the Scottish Health and Sport Committee was quoted in the debate and in the report of that committee \( **5.5d**, p.43 and p.49\). The Assisted Suicide \(Scotland\) Bill was defeated on 27 May 2015 by 82 votes to 36 \( **5.5c**\). 

 <ins>Germany</ins> 

 In a co\-written article, published after the votes in Scotland and England, Jones presented evidence that legalization of assisted dying leads to more people taking their own lives \( **3.6**\). This research was cited twice in the Bundestag debate on assisted suicide on 6 November 2015 \(which voted by 309 votes to 235 to restrict organised forms of assistance in suicide\) \( **5.6**\). 

 <ins>Canada</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>New</ins> <ins>Zealand</ins> <ins>and Australia</ins> 

 In 2015 Jones provided a submission to the External Panel on Options for a Legislative Response to Carter v Canada \( **5.7**\). Jones made written contributions to the Health Select Committee Investigation into Ending One’s Life in New Zealand and to the New Zealand Parliamentary Justice Committee on the End of Life Choice Bill. He was invited to give oral evidence to both committees \( **5.8a**\). While Jones did not engage directly in the debates in Australia, his work \( **3.6**\) was cited in submissions to a parliamentary select committee in Western Australia \( **5.8b**\) and in parliamentary debate in Victoria \( **5.8c**\). 

 In both Canada and New Zealand, Jones’s contributions to consultations were appreciated by official committees of inquiry \( **5.8a**\). However, in both cases a change of government led to the reports of these committees being set aside and new committees being constituted with a strong bias in favour of legalisation. Jones’ work on the connection between the legalisation of physician\-assisted suicide and suicide rates \( **3.6**\) was quoted in the Ministry of Justice Departmental Report of December 2018 \( **5.8d**\). Nevertheless, legislation in Canada was at least restricted to cases where “natural death was reasonably foreseeable” and legislation in New Zealand has been made dependent on the outcome of a referendum.  In both jurisdictions the debate continues. 

 **Shaping Catholic and public discussion of “Dying Well”** 

 The debates in the United Kingdom and internationally placed great weight on the dangers of legalising assisted suicide but they also revealed the need to promote a more positive account of dying well. Since 2007 the Catholic Churches of England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland have celebrated an annual “Day for Life”. In 2015 the theme was “Cherishing Life, Accepting Death” and Jones was involved in drafting the material \( **5.9a**\). This title is taken from previous work on living wills that Jones produced for the Catholic bishops \( **5.9b**, pp.7, 11\-12, 24\-5\). Matthews produced resources for the 2016 and the 2017 Day for Life \( **5.9c\-d**\). The resources produced by Jones and Matthews were distributed to all Catholic parishes in England and Wales \(over 2,500 parishes\) and the theme of the Day for Life was reported widely in the secular and religious media. 

 After the Day for Life 2015, the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales decided to support a project to make available online and in a modern form the Catholic tradition of the Art of Dying Well \( *ars moriendi*\). After its launch in November 2016 the project subsequently moved to St Mary’s University. Jones was a member of the reference group for the project from its inception and Matthews was instrumental its coming to St Mary’s.  The project is independent of CBET but collaborates with CBET on events such as *A Graceful Death: an exhibition* by artist Antonia Rolls, which presented portraits of people who were dying alongside poetry selected and read by Stammers. *The Art of Dying Well* has won a Jerusalem Award for one of its podcasts and is available at  [https://www.artofdyingwell.org/](https://www.artofdyingwell.org/) \( **5.10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 High\-resolution imagery from Earth Observation \(EO\) satellites is essential for applications such as rapid disaster response, agriculture and urban planning. Micro\-vibrations arising from mechanical disturbances on board spacecraft adversely affect image quality. Research from Surrey Space Centre characterising and modelling micro\-vibrations and innovative active micro\-vibration control techniques were applied in commercial EO satellites TripleSat/DMC3 Constellation and SSTL\-S1. Further impact has been realised through the commercial application of high\-resolution imagery, facilitation of international disaster responses, and informing standards for engineering practice for spacecraft development. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Surrey Space Centre \(University of Surrey\) – led by Professor Aglietti \(2014\-2019\) \- has been at the forefront of small satellite technology since its inception in 1979. 

 Micro\-vibrations – low\-level mechanical disturbances on board spacecraft \- are an issue of growing importance as some modern payloads, and in particular, the new generations of optical instruments, require extreme platform stability. Micro\-vibrations are generally produced by internal mechanisms on board spacecraft, including reaction wheel assemblies \(RWAs\), momentum wheel assemblies, cryo\-coolers, and solar and antenna pointing mechanisms, with RWAs considered the most significant source.  The low\-level of these micro\-vibrations coupled with their wide frequency range \(from sub hertz to hundred hertz\) makes their modelling and analysis a significant challenge. There was, therefore a need for a model which \(i\) gives accurate estimates covering a wide frequency range, \(ii\) reduces the personnel and time costs associated with conducting an extensive experimental test campaign, and \(iii\) reduces the computational effort without affecting the quality of the result. 

###  Modelling micro\-vibrations 

###  Various approaches have been considered to address the issues related to micro\-vibration predictions. The industry\-standard approach is the Stochastic Finite Element Method \(SFEM\) of which the Monte Carlo Simulation \(MCS\) \- the simplest method for treating the response variability calculation in the framework of SFEM \- is the most well\-known. However, it is well documented that at frequencies beyond the first few modes of a system, SFEM is unsuitable for obtaining efficient predictions for micro\-vibrations. 

 In response, Aglietti and his team proposed merging the efficiency of the Craig\-Bampton reduction technique \(CB\) with the simplicity and reliability of MCS to produce an overall analysis methodology to evaluate the dynamic response of large structural assemblies in the mid\-frequency range, extending it to the case when multiple sources of micro\-vibrations act simultaneously on the same structure. The method succeeds in producing results very similar to those from a full MCS while reducing drastically the computational effort involved. This is particularly valuable in the space industry, as different parts of the satellite usually have different levels of maturity, characterised by different levels of uncertainty in their parameters **\[R1, R2\].** 

 The resulting computational procedure was applied to the new high\-resolution SSTL\-300\-S1 satellite \(launched 2018\), and the predictions compared with the experimental results retrieved during the physical micro\-vibration testing of the satellite **\[R1, R2, R3\]**. 

###  Measurement of disturbances induced by the reaction wheel assembly 

 The primary challenge in satellite micro\-vibration analysis is the characterisation of the potential disturbance sources. For this, accurate measurement is essential. Current practice in the space industry is to use the outcomes from the hard\-mounted RWA configuration measurements as direct inputs for micro\-vibration analysis. However, Aglietti argues that this method is fundamentally flawed as it does not represent real\-world operating conditions where the RWA is mounted on a flexible structure. In **\[R3\]**, Aglietti and his team consider a cantilever configured RWA \[developed by Aglietti\] and present a mathematical model to describe its dynamics. The model was implemented to predict the dynamic mass of the RWA in both static and operative conditions. The team demonstrated that predictions derived from the traditional approach ignored significant characteristics of the system response. Application of correcting factors \(i.e. supporting structure dynamic masses\) considerably improved the agreement between analytical estimates and test results. The inclusion of the gyroscopic effect in the RWA internal dynamics characterisation further improved predictions. 

###  Micro\-vibration control techniques 

 Active \(as opposed to passive\) control techniques are often required to mitigate sources of micro\-vibrations on board spacecraft. However, reliability issues and additional electrical power use are major drawbacks of active control techniques, such as active isolation systems, limiting their usefulness. 

 Aglietti’s team proposed an electromagnetic shunt damper \(EMSD\) connected to a negative\-resistance circuit. The negative resistance produces an overall reduction of the circuit resistance resulting in an increase of the induced current in the closed circuit. This damper can be classified as semi\-active since it does not require any control algorithm to operate and has low power requirements, simplified electronics and small device mass. The damper was shown \(analytically and experimentally\) to be capable of effectively isolating typical satellite micro\-vibration sources **\[R4, R5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Aglietti’s research on satellite micro\-vibrations **\[R1\-R5\]** has directly impacted the ability of Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. \(SSTL\) to produce satellites that achieve the platform stability required for high\-resolution imagery \(<1m\). Data and high\-resolution images from these satellites offer significant benefits to both distributors and end\-users. 

###  Adoption of technology in commercial satellites and setting the industry standard 

 The TripleSat/DMC3 \(launched in 2015\) is a Disaster Monitoring Constellation \(DMC\) made up of three SSTL\-300S1 satellites. As a direct result of Aglietti’s micro\-vibration research **\[R1\-R5\]**, SSTL were able to mitigate micro\-vibrations in the TripleSat/DMC3 satellites by redesigning the RWA isolation system located at the base of the SSTL\-300S1 platform, which had been the dominant source of micro\-vibration **\[S1\]**. This mitigation resulted in significant improvements in platform stability. The Chief Technology Officer \(CTO\) of SSTL stated, “Professor Aglietti’s research work <…> directly contributed to SSTL development strategy for higher resolution imagery and more cost effective EO \[Earth Observation\] spacecraft and future missions.” **\[S2\]** 

 TripleSat/DMC3 is owned by SSTL and managed under licence on behalf of Twenty First Century Aerospace Technology \(21AT\). 21AT paid SSTL £110M for their services, leasing 100% of the image capacity of the three satellites for the first 7 years **\[S3\]**. 

 In 2018, SSTL launched another EO satellite \(SSTL\-S1\) utilising the same SSTL\-300 platform technology as TripleSat/DMC3. The high\-resolution imagery data from this satellite is leased to 21AT and Airbus for a contract value of £25M **\[S4\]**. SSTL continue to apply the outcomes of Aglietti’s research team in subsequent high\-resolution EO satellites. 

 Aglietti’s micro\-vibration expertise also contributed to the ECSS\-E\-HB\-32\-26 standard, “Spacecraft mechanical loads analysis handbook” \(European Cooperation for Space Standardisation\), drawing on techniques detailed under a European Space Agency contract **\[S5\]**. This standard has been the recommended engineering practice for European developers of space systems throughout the REF period and remains the current standard today. 

###  Enabling Access to High\-Resolution Imagery 

 There is a need from multiple market sectors for high\-resolution images for applications such as urban planning, crop yield calculation, pollution monitoring and biodiversity assessment **\[S6\]**. Indeed, sales of EO space systems by the European space manufacturing industry reached €1.9billion in 2017, representing \~21% of all European space systems manufacturing revenues \[Source: Copernicus Market report, 2019\]. 

 The TripleSat/DMC3 Constellation consists of three identical ultra\-high\-resolution optical satellites that can survey any point of the globe on a daily basis delivering 0.8m \(panchromatic\) and 4m ground sampling distance \(GSD\) multispectral high\-resolution imagery with a 23.4K swath. The high\-resolution imagery from TripleSat/DMC3 Constellation data is being distributed by organisations including Satellite Imaging Corporation \(SIC\) **\[S7\] and** Earth\-i **\[S8\].** On 10 April 2018, Airbus entered into an agreement with satellite operator 21AT to distribute the images acquired by their TripleSat constellation. 

 Earth\-i is a Geo\-Spatial Information provider.  Earth\-i partnered with suppliers SSTL and 21AT to provide EO data and services from the TripleSat/DMC3 constellation to business, government, traders, investors, and NGOs since its launch as a start\-up in 2015. In 2019/20, Earth\-i employed a staff of 31 with a turnover of £1.9M \(Companies House\) and is ranked in the top ten most important and influential companies in the global space industry according to the 2018/19 Global Ranking Report **\[S8\].** 

###  Image use case example from Earth\-i: Advanced Coffee Crop Optimisation for Rural Development \(ACCORD\) 

 **Coffee is one of the world’s premium quality crops, but farmers lack access to timely and accurate weather data to help them improve their yield and farming practices. ACCORD provides proactive, targeted crop management information to improve the livelihoods and incomes of smallholder coffee farmers in Rwanda and Kenya. The crop management advice delivered via a mobile app is derived from satellite Earth observation \(including TripleSat/DMC3\) and advanced micro\-climate information.  The information helps to make significant improvements to coffee crop quality and yield, allowing farmers to achieve higher incomes for their work and improve the quality of life for their families \[S9\]. **

###  Aiding Disaster Relief 

 The TripleSat/DMC3 contributes images and data to the International Charter ‘Space and Major Disaster’ \(disastercharter.org\) \- a worldwide collaboration under which satellite data are made freely available for humanitarian use in the event of major international disasters. The primary users of this data under this charter are disaster relief organisations, for whom accurate and locationally precise information on the damage caused is vital for prioritised, coordinated and safe rescue and relief operations. Satellite imagery data enable large areas to be reviewed at speed and rescue activities to be accelerated. 

 The following are examples of how the high\-resolution images from the disaster monitoring constellation TripleSat/DMC3 have been used to support disaster responses: 

-  Images provided to the agencies in charge of the disaster response for the Fort McMurray wildfires in Alberta, Canada \(May 2016\) **\[S10\].** 

-  Mapping of an earthquake and tsunami on New Zealand \(Kaikoura\) \(November 2016\). A Linked Open Data for Global Disaster \(LODGD\) Task Group report following the tsunami states, “During the Kaikoura earthquake, Integrated Research on Disaster Risk \(IRDR’s\) Disaster Loss DATA project and CODATA Task Group Linked Open Data for Global Disaster Risk Research \(LODGD\) worked together with Tonkin \+ Taylor International \(T\+TI\) to provide TripleSat satellite images of the affected Hurunui District. Geo\-spatial information was developed for the New Zealand Earthquake Commission \(EQC\) on the damage caused, and was made available through a web\-based viewer to all government agencies, response and recovery agencies, engineers and researchers, thereby informing first response and mitigation measure.” **\[S11\]**

 Research undertaken by the Research Group in Computational Linguistics \(RGCL\) led to the development of new text simplification guidelines to make texts more accessible for people with autism spectrum disorder \(ASD\), as well as software to support their implementation by users. This case study focuses on impacts relating to the experiences of service users from three different types of organisations: NHS Foundation Trusts \[I1\]; non\-profit associations providing services for people with ASD \[I2\]; and a software design and development company \[I3\]. These impacts occurred as a result of research being used by practitioners/ professionals in conducting their work, influencing professional standards and guidelines, and effecting change in educational practices in higher education \(HE\) beyond the submitting unit.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Applying Natural Language Processing \(NLP\) research for societal benefit is one of RGCL’s main priorities: by conducting research in close collaboration with organisations, we improve their working methods and help to develop new products. Our researchers are actively involved in knowledge exchange between academia and end\-users of research. 

 People with ASD usually have language deficits with a life\-long impact on their psychosocial functioning. In education, only up to 51% of school leavers with ASD achieve GCSE grades A\-C with up to 22% transitioning into HE. This compares with 72% and 42%, respectively, for neurotypical school leavers. Up to a third of 16\-24 year olds with ASD do not participate in education, employment, or training. This is true of only 17% of neurotypical 16\-24 year olds. People with ASD often have reading comprehension deficits that may cause misinterpretation of literal meanings and difficulty in understanding complex instructions. Complex sentences, referential expressions, uncommon or technical words and figures of speech constitute barriers to reading comprehension for people with ASD. In the EU\-funded FP7 FIRST project \(2011\- 2014\), RGCL developed a methodology for text simplification and software, which helps intermediaries to implement the associated method when converting texts into a more accessible form for people with ASD. The software, called *OpenBook*, can automatically detect linguistic barriers to reading comprehension in input texts and transform the texts to remove some of these barriers and so make the texts more accessible for autistic individuals. 

 Since fully automatic text processing is error\-prone, the consortium led by RGCL developed an editing tool for carers which enables them to use RGCL’s software \(NLP technology\) to rapidly adapt texts into a more accessible form for end users. In this way, the changes made to a document are supervised, and the appropriate types of simplification are applied for each user. 

 Development of the text simplification methodology was one of RGCL’s main research foci in the project. A considerable amount of literature on the reading comprehension deficits of people with ASD existed in 2011. However, the development of language technologies to address these issues required a more specific and fine\-grained specification of the barriers to reading comprehension faced by this population than was available at that time. RGCL supervised a new detailed user requirements analysis \(URA\) which specified these barriers and ensured that only the most suitable text simplification components were integrated in the system \[R4\]. 

 <ins>Research findings:</ins> 

 The URA that RGCL supervised included a comprehensive literature review, interviews with end users \(carers, educators, healthcare professionals, and people with ASD\), and surveys of users’ opinions. The URA revealed two main research findings: 

 <ins>F1. Specific linguistic features impede reading comprehension</ins> 

 A set of 46 linguistic obstacles to reading comprehension was derived through our research. Text adaptations were proposed by end users to overcome each obstacle. The obstacles were also classified using a ternary scheme specifying their level of priority \(impact\). 

 <ins>F2. Provision of assistive linguistic content can make texts more accessible</ins> 

 This included indicative summaries of the content of long documents and illustrative images to improve understanding of specialised terms. 

 In its research, RGCL focused on F1 and F2. Within category F1, two main types of obstacles were highlighted: obstacles to reading comprehension caused by complex linguistic structure and obstacles caused by ambiguity in meaning. Examples of highly ranked user requirements of categories F1 and F2 are: 

| Research finding | Obstacle to reading comprehension | Suggested text adaptation | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | Long sentences | Provide single clause sentences | High |
| F1 | Phraseological units \(idioms, lexicalised metaphors\) | Provide simple definitions to explain phraseological units | High |
| F2 | Infrequent words | Support understanding of less common words with images | High |

 *Table 1: Examples of user requirements* 

 Research findings F1 and F2 underpinned development of text simplification guidelines and software components to overcome fourteen of the most highly ranked linguistic barriers. The text simplification guidelines that the consortium developed as a by\-product of the URA were presented in Fig 3 of research output \[R4\]. RGCL’s subsequent experiments using eye tracking to investigate autistic reading behaviour led to further refinement of the URA conducted in the FIRST project \[R5, R6\]. 

 The research underpinning this impact case study includes assessment of the human text simplification process which follows these guidelines and which is supported by use of the OpenBook tool. It was found that intermediaries using OpenBook produced accessible texts in just 60% of the time taken when OpenBook was not used. Furthermore, texts produced using OpenBook were more accessible than those produced without it \[R3, R4\]. Formal testing of 153 adults and 90 children revealed that autistic reading comprehension of texts simplified on the basis of the guidelines by people using OpenBook was better than their comprehension of the unsimplified texts by a small but statistically significant amount \[R3, R4\]. 

 In addition to the URA, RGCL participated in a research project on the cognitive processing strategies employed by autistic and neurotypical web users accessing information in web pages \[R1, R2\]. This study led to a third research finding: 

 <ins> **F3.</ins> <ins>Web pages with fewer elements require less cognitive processing effort for people with ASD and the use of multimedia</ins> <ins>in web pages requires more**</ins> 

 More generally, appropriate visual formatting of documents and software interfaces brings improvements in text accessibility and user experience. 

 Therefore, software interface developers and web content providers should work to improve the accessibility of textual context rather than supplementing it with multimedia \(e.g. video explanations\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This case study presents three impacts arising from the underpinning research. These include changes to the working practices and capabilities of six organisations, which led to improvements in the experiences of their service users. Impact was achieved in three different groups of organisations: two NHS Foundation Trusts \[I1\], three non\-profit associations \[I2\], and a software design and development company \[I3\]. These impacts are examples of RGCL’s applied research influencing professional standards and guidelines in health and support service delivery and software development. 

 <ins>I1. NHS Foundation Trusts</ins> 

 A major factor behind the successful delivery of clinical services is effective communication with service users. Together, the South London and Maudsley \(SLaM\) and Central and North West London \(CNWL\) NHS Foundations Trusts provide mental health services to over 140,000 patients each year. Many of these have learning disabilities \(including problems with reading comprehension\), making the ability to improve communication with them by converting information leaflets and clinical letters into a more accessible form particularly valuable. The CNWL Foundation Trust was a partner in the FIRST project who helped to pilot the research findings. The text simplification guidelines developed in the project \[F1, F2\] were implemented by the consultant psychiatrist and her teams at the SLAM and CNWL Foundation Trusts to improve the accessibility of information for their patients. This research\-influenced change in professional methods has since had a direct and significant impact on service delivery by improving verbal and written communication with patients \[C1\]. 

 <ins>I2. Non\-Profit Associations Providing Services for People with ASD</ins> 

 RGCL’s research brought positive changes to the quality of services provided by three associations of this type. These bring improvements in the experiences of service users and will help the associations adapt to changes in cultural values \(accessibility and neurodiversity\). 

 Autism\-Europe \(AE, Belgium\) is an international association whose main objective is to advance the rights of autistic people and to help them improve their quality of life. It represents over 5 million people and brings together more than 90 national and regional associations. Research led by RGCL brought new knowledge about the experiences of autistic people with reading comprehension difficulties and about the importance of text accessibility for people with ASD. After the project ended, AE built on this knowledge \[F1, F2\], dedicating time and resources to develop “easy\-to\-read” content and webpages for its users and members \[C9\]. RGCL research helped staff at AE to better meet the needs of the people they work with and advocate for \[C2\]. 

 Their participation in the FIRST project provided AE with new opportunities for awareness\-raising about autism, including opportunities to reach out to a more diverse audience through the production of newsletters and videos and the hosting of dissemination events \[C2\].  Knowledge gained by AE during the FIRST project enabled them to participate in H2020 projects exploring innovative medicines \(AIMS\-2\-TRIALS\) and assistive technologies \(DE\-ENIGMA\), and an EU\-funded project investigating prevalence, diagnosis, and interventions to improve care and support of people with ASD \(ASDEU\) \[C2\]. This allowed AE to benefit from knowledge exchange and interaction with academics, commercial organisations, and health service providers, further enhancing the expertise underpinning their service provision \[C2\]. 

 Deletrea SLP \(Spain\) is a centre for the treatment and diagnosis of people with ASD which includes provision of educational support. Deletrea provides evaluation and diagnostic services to approximately 320 families each year and therapeutic interventions to around 240 people with ASD and their families each month. In the FIRST project, Deletrea benefited from increased knowledge about the reading comprehension of people with ASD, including the international dimension of these issues \[C5, C6\]. Knowledge acquired through the FIRST project allowed staff at Deletrea to know more precisely which variables can hinder the reading comprehension of people with ASD. This enabled them to rapidly produce accessible content for their users, improving the quality of care provided. Deletrea now provides reading support for people with ASD at a higher quality level than it did before the project began. This includes guidance for parents and carers to improve the accessibility of educational content for their children \[C5, C6\]. FIRST raised Deletrea’s awareness of the potential of assistive technologies to improve service users’ abilities to read and study. It now encourages their use of technologies such as *MyStudyBar* and *Detach that book* \[C5, C6\]. 

 Before the FIRST project began, Parallel World \(PW, Bulgaria\) was a small organisation serving a user base of seven members. By the end of the project, thanks to its participation in user\-focused research activities, PW had increased its user base to 17. Today it stands at more than 80 \[C3, C8\]. 

 In the project, PW had a key role in interviewing children with ASD and their carers and in running reading comprehension tests of children with ASD. This included the recruitment of participants, thematic analysis of interviews, and analysis of reading comprehension test results. The increase in PW’s know\-how, capability, and reputation due to its participation in the FIRST project \[C3, C8\] paved the way for its subsequent success. The organisation now runs a social enterprise which employs young people with disabilities, currently employs eight full\-time employees and eight trainees, and has participated as a lead partner in numerous research projects. These include 15 national \(Bulgarian\) and international projects funded by programmes such as *Erasmus*, the *Bulgarian Association of Children with Disabilities*, and Bulgaria’s *Human Resources Development \(HRD\)* operational programme \[C3, C8\]. 

 Prior to the URA and evaluation processes conducted in the FIRST project, charities in Bulgaria had little knowledge of the kinds of barriers that people with ASD face when reading and the strategies which may be used to overcome these barriers \[C3, C8\]. Research led by RGCL bridged a gap in knowledge about ASD in Bulgaria and led to the derivation of a more detailed linguistic specification of these barriers \(research findings F1 and F2\). With this knowledge, for the first time, charities in Bulgaria serving children with ASD began to provide reading comprehension support for their service users. After the initial push provided by dissemination of project research findings, two other charities in Bulgaria continued work in this direction: the *ASSIST foundation* and the *Elia foundation*. Both are working to adapt reading support tools for people with disabilities in Bulgaria. The parents of children and adolescents with ASD who are supported by organisations like these are now being equipped with strategies to support their children’s reading \[C3, C8\]. 

 <ins>I3. Software Design and Development</ins> <ins>Company</ins> 

 Kodar Ltd \(Bulgaria\) gained knowledge in the FIRST project about text accessibility for people with ASD. As a result, they were able to design more accessible software \(user interfaces\). Kodar usually develops software applications for business users which use tables and forms, rather than text, to present information and enable users to enter data. Research finding F3 revealed important principles of interface design and Kodar exploited this knowledge to create user interfaces with minimal distracting elements, organising fields on the screen in a way that reflects the natural order in which neurodiverse users focus their attention. Kodar estimates that these interfaces have around 500 concurrent users, based mainly in the Netherlands and Belgium. RGCL research findings F1, F2, and F3 improved Kodar’s design process \[C4, C7\]. 

 The URA conducted in FIRST identified key concepts in user interface design that improve the comprehension of written text. Among these is the concept of personalisation, which emerged as an important feature of the OpenBook tool \[C4, C7\]. This finding proved valuable in three projects undertaken by Kodar, one of the consortium members, after the FIRST project ended. In these, Kodar developed portals for e\-Learning and e\-Testing and implemented analogous personalisation of those platforms for their users. This led to the development of portals which provide users with unique learning experiences. Each year, these portals are accessed by more than 2,000 students at Plovdiv University, the Bulgarian National Sports Academy, and the European High School in Economics and Management. This created changes in educational practices in higher education beyond the submitting unit.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Academy soccer players play 40\-50 matches per season and travel to play matches. Sleep, recovery and wellbeing are crucial for performance and health. The findings from this research have impacted day\-to\-day practices of two English Premier League 2 Academy Clubs. Changes include: players being given more time to sleep and rest following away matches and losses, a hotel stay\-over in the location of the match, later training start\-times, prescribing recovery practices for players to undertake at home and giving players a day off. This has led to improved training practices and player recovery. Furthermore, the findings have increased awareness of the importance of psychological support for injured players. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research for this impact case study has been conducted by Harper and Naughton at the University of Huddersfield \(UoH\). The investigations have been undertaken in collaboration with colleagues from external organisations and institutions: Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club \(Dr Will Abbott\), Liverpool John Moores University \(Dr Thomas Brownlee\), Loughborough University \(Dr Tom Clifford\), Newcastle University \(Andy Richardson\) and Edge Hill University \(Dr Richard Page\). 

 The main focus of the research has been on assessing subjective wellbeing and mental fatigue in Professional English academy soccer players. Professional soccer is characterised by high training and match loads, with risk of overtraining, injuries and psychosocial disorders. Therefore, players’ recovery and readiness to train is often assessed via objective and subjective measurement tools. This enables practitioners and coaches to modulate their training schedules and practices, in order to facilitate optimal restoration and adaptation. 

 The purpose of our research was to assess the impact of contextual \(location, result and quality of opposition\) factors of match\-play on subjective markers of wellbeing and mental fatigue, as well as the impact of injury, match selection and training load on mental wellbeing. 

 <ins> **Factors that influence</ins> <ins>player</ins> <ins>subjective</ins> <ins></ins><ins>wellbeing</ins> <ins>– Paper 3.1**</ins> 

 Research carried during the 2016/2017 English Premier League 2 season revealed that match location, result and the quality of opposition all negatively influence the subjective wellbeing \(in particular mood, stress and sleep quality\) of under\-23 soccer players for up to three days post\-match, irrespective of the physical demands of the matches. Further, both playing away matches and losing \(independently of each other\) caused significantly higher stress and lower sleep quality and mood compared to playing at home, or winning. Furthermore, irrespective of result, players had significantly greater fatigue and stress, and lower mood following matches against top\-table, high quality opponents compared to lower quality opposition. 

 <ins> **Injury as a compounding factor</ins> <ins>– Paper 3.2**</ins> 

 Research conducted during the 2017/2018 English Premier League 2 season revealed that players’ mental wellbeing \(measured using the Warwick\-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale; WEMWBS\) was significantly and clinically meaningfully lower when injured compared to when they were not injured, with the length of time spent injured and not being selected for matches the main factors that explained this. Training load did not appear to significantly impact WEMWBS scores. 

 <ins> **Factors that contribute to mental fatigue</ins> <ins>– Paper 3.3**</ins> 

 As mental fatigue has been shown to negatively impact aspects of physical, skill, tactical and perceptual\-cognitive performance, and as coaches and players have identified mental fatigue as an issue throughout the professional football season, further research also carried out during the 2017/2018 English Premier League 2 season aimed to assess players’ mental fatigue, using a visual analogue scale, throughout the season. The research revealed that players report significantly higher mental fatigue following matches, which persists for three days following the match. Furthermore, players’ mental fatigue response was closely correlated with other measures of subjective wellness such as muscle soreness, fatigue, sleep quality and motivation to train. Players’ mental fatigue response was particularly impacted by losing compared to winning and drawing, with significantly higher mental fatigue values reported following matches that were lost compared to won or drawn.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research described in this case study has revealed impact in two main areas: 

1.  Improved post\-match recovery practices 

1.  Enhanced support for player wellbeing. 

 **Improved post\-match recovery practices** 

 The findings from paper 3.1 led to changes to post\-match recovery practices for two English Premier League Academy clubs \(C1 and C2\). The majority of English Premier League 2 matches are played in the evening \(19:00\). As such, matches typically finish at 20:50. Factoring in the time for players to return to the changing rooms, shower, dress and return to the team bus, it may be as late as 22:00\-22:30 that a team would begin their journey home. If the club is competing away from home, and depending on the location of their opponents, the players may not arrive at their residences until as late as 04:00. In paper 3.1, we observed lower subjective ratings of sleep on the day following an away match. As a result, C2 adopted a policy of staying in a hotel in the town/city of their opponents on the night of the match: *“the lower subjective ratings of sleep on MD\+1 compared to MD contributed to our decision to ‘stay over’ after away games with an evening KO and requiring >3hrs return travel. The rationale included providing a more nutritious and substantial meal at the hotel, quickly after the game and the opportunity for the players to retain their typical sleep routines before travelling back on MD\+1”* \[5.2\]. 

 Coaching staff were particularly interested in the findings of decreased subjective wellness on the day following a match, as this was their typical time for delivering post\-match analysis \(e.g., highlighting strengths and weaknesses from the match using video\). This led to a change in the timing of these analysis sessions \[5.2\]. 

 C1 changed their training prescription based on the findings of the study, with the weekly microcycle being structured differently following an away match compared with a home match. This included asking players to report to the training ground the day after an away match three to four hours later than usual to allow for more sleep. This led to improved subjective ratings of muscle soreness and fatigue on the day following a match, as well as improved mood and sleep, leading to enhanced quality of training \[5.1\]. 

 C2’s practices on the day following a match also changed, with either the training session being delayed until later in the day, allowing the players to complete a ‘home based’ recovery session, or giving the players a day off. Overall, the findings of the paper led to C2 using their subjective wellness data when making decisions on training prescription across the whole season \[5.2\]. 

 The findings from paper 3.3, where players’ subjective ratings of mental fatigue were significantly higher following a loss compared to a win changed C1’s approach to training following a loss, giving the players more time off to recover before analysing the previous match and training. They felt that this would then provide the players with more time to recover both mentally and physically and have a heightened receptiveness to tactical information, as well as physical training \[5.1\]. 

 **Enhanced support for player wellbeing** 

 The findings from paper 3.2 led to changes in the wellbeing support for players at C1. The significantly lower ratings of mental wellbeing from injured players highlighted that there was a need not just for physical support, but also for further psychological support, for injured players: *“…that really highlighted for us the importance of… the psychological support around injury, not just the physical support around injury. So as a consequence… we’ve touched base with our Psychology Department. We’ve actually, as a Club, from this season onwards, recruited Mental Wellbeing Practitioners and we’ve got access to Applied Counsellors as well...”* \[5.1\]. 

 These findings helped stimulate discussions around the importance of mental health for academy footballers and established a mental wellbeing service at C1. The club now administers the questionnaire used in the study \(Warwick\-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale\) to players every week, to assess changes in mental well\-being across the season, in order to stimulate conversations and identify interventions as necessary. This has led to a culture change in the organisation and increased the importance of assessing mental wellbeing \[5.1\]. 

 Taken together, all three papers have had an impact at C1 on the relationship between the performance staff and the coaching staff, with increased objectivity and application of empirical evidence to the coaching process and day\-to\-day practices \[5.1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Essex research has <ins>revolutionised on\-chip debug, monitoring and analytics to deliver world leading on\-chip diagnostic solutions</ins> via commercialisation by UltraSoC Technologies, a company whose creation and growth has been underpinned by Essex research. These solutions ensure correct functionality of complex microchips, substantially accelerate product development and ensure correct operation of the deployed systems in many, often safety critical, domains.  Since August 2013, UltraSoC has <ins>attracted investment worth over</ins> <ins>USD</ins> <ins>20 million</ins> and has licensed this technology to <ins>more than 20 leading edge start\-ups and Tier 1 semiconductor</ins> companies including ARM, Huawei, Microsemi, Intel, Seagate and Western Digital. Employing this technology enables SoC design teams to <ins>double their profitability</ins> and <ins>reduce their design costs by 25%</ins>. UltraSoC’s technology is also emerging as the <ins>de\-facto standard</ins> debug support interface for RISC\-V processor platform. UltraSoC so successfully enabled semiconductor industry customers to overcome manufacturing defects, software and hardware bugs, device early\-failure and wear\-out, as well as improve devices’ functional safety and malicious attack protection, <ins>that it was acquired by Siemens in 2020 to help the global technology powerhouse provide comparable support.</ins>

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since the early 2000s Multiprocessor Systems\-on\-a\-Chip \(MPSoC\) have become extensively used in electronic systems. Such platforms are now <ins>commonplace in everyday life</ins> and underpin a vast array of consumer items including cars, smartphones and household appliances. The successful development of these products relies on, on\-chip de\-bugging and analysis in a short timeframe. However, the advancement of SoC technology, and particularly the move towards MPSoCs, rendered previous software debugging strategies obsolete, unreliable or insufficient. Traditionally these strategies were focused on providing debug support for chips comprising single processors, or multiple processors of a specific family of processor architectures. 

 Professor Klaus McDonald\-Maier identified the <ins>need for support of software application development in SoC</ins> architectures, especially in cases where <ins>complex software</ins> is required to interact and execute on <ins>multiple processor cores</ins>. In cases where SoCs feature other highly interactive blocks \(which may contribute to undesired behaviour of the system\), this presented a significant technical challenge \[R1, R2\]. Beginning at the University of Essex in 2005, McDonald\-Maier and Hopkins worked on EPSRC funded projects \[G1 – G4\] that developed initial concepts to address this into practical implementations \[R3\]. McDonald\-Maier’s subsequent work \[e.g. G5 and G6\] expanded this technology \[R4\-6\]. 

 The research \[R3\] provided a <ins>highly modular debug support architecture</ins>, consisting of two important stages. Firstly, debug support adapters were provided in order to connect each processor core, peripheral or interconnect, to the debug infrastructure. The second stage then controlled these adapters, combining their debug data streams in order to preserve timing and compress resulting data to an absolute minimum. Critically, this compression meant that debug data could be straightforwardly sent from the SoC to an external development station or PC using a variety of limited bandwidth interfaces. This is an important characteristic because every product chip includes this additional debug infrastructure and therefore it is required in a high volume of devices. 

 The development of this process represented the <ins>first systems\-centric debug support architecture</ins> for SoCs featuring multiple processor cores \(i.e. cores from multiple IP provider such as ARM, MIPS etc. as well as other active peripherals\). The architecture <ins>substantially outperformed</ins> the state of the art \(i.e. <ins>by an order of magnitude</ins>\) and, notably, achieved this in a significantly more compact implementation than existing architectures. The developed process provides debug support for two processor cores using less logic than that required for one processor core when using previous state of the art. Core contributions focus on <ins>ease of integration</ins> of processors and other components from different vendors and improved detection capability for unusual events and capability to provide this during the deployment stage of the respective SoC and for cybersecurity purposes. 

 Further work from 2014 focused on increasing ease of integration and flexibility with a message\-based infrastructure and focus on detection capability for systems security and analytics \[R4\-5\]. The Essex research group continued to contribute to the development of this technology in UltraSoC, the University of Essex spinout established for its commercialisation on it, and Siemens, who acquired it. For instance, as part of EPSRC funded research projects SPIRIT \[G5\] and the EPSRC National Centre for Nuclear Robotics \[G6\], there was extensive direct collaboration, focusing on methods for on\-line detection of faults introduced through exposure to extreme environments such as radiation \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 UltraSoC was spun out to commercialise the debug and on\-chip analytics technology invented as part of EPSRC funded research \[G1\-G4\]. The company has subsequently been built around research undertaken by McDonald\-Maier and his Embedded and Intelligent Systems \(EIS\) laboratory at the University of Essex \[S1\]. The research group at Essex recognised that the outputs of their work \[R1\-R3\] held <ins>broad applicability</ins> for providing debug support to MPSoCs in a vast array of global scenarios that rely on embedded systems. In a marketplace where <ins>nearly half the cost of chip development</ins> <ins>was</ins> <ins>spent on de\-bugging activities</ins>, the novel architecture resulting from the research conducted at Essex enables development of <ins>more reliable software</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>having</ins> <ins>significant</ins> <ins>economic and safety implications</ins> in consumer electronics and safety\-critical applications \[S1\] \(self\-driving vehicle electronics exemplify this\). Essex researchers sought to share the capabilities and associated benefits of this technology with a wide audience and developed a robust strategy in order to transform research insight into practical benefit. This centred on a broad range of dissemination activities that *targeted investment* from a variety of sources, in order to help commercialise the technology via its spin\-out UltraSoC Technologies. 

 UltraSoC has developed significantly since August 2013 with Venture capital funding raised from the original series A investors Octopus and new investors led by electronic design legend and Chairman of UltraSoC, Prof Alberto Sangiovanni\-Vincentelli \(UBerkeley and co\-founder of Cadence and Synopsis, Atlante Ventures\) and expansion to <ins>new design centres</ins> in Bristol and Poland, increasing the number of employees from 12 in July 2013 to over 40 in 2020 \(FTEs: 40\) \[S1\]. UltraSoC raised significant rounds, with GBP 5M led by Atlante for the continued expansion of the UltraSoC team and its product portfolio to support <ins>all mainstream embedded processor</ins> platforms in 2017 \(see C21 of \[S2\]\) and  [UltraSoC secured new investment ](https://www.businessleader.co.uk/ultrasoc-secures-new-5m-investment/69388/)of GBP 5 M \(see C21 of \[S2\]\) and in 2019 an additional GBP 5M to focus on <ins>hardware security</ins> \(see C9 of \[S2\]\) [.](https://www.ultrasoc.com/ultrasoc-secures-5m-investment-to-target-safety-and-security-applications-with-its-embedded-analytics/) Recently, UltraSoC has revisited the work on analytics, originally undertaken in the RESIP \[G2\] and Espacenet \[G4\] grants, where this was employed for  [design space optimisation](https://www.ultrasoc.com/cycle-accurate-trace-boosts-performance-optimization-capabilities-ultrasoc-embedded-analytics-infrastructure/) and  [security applications](https://www.ultrasoc.com/ultrasoc-announces-next-generation-hardware-based-cybersecurity-products/) and expanded this towards applications in  [AI and Machine Learning](https://www.ultrasoc.com/ultrasoc-embedded-analytics-selected-support-wave-computings-tritonai-64-ip-platform/) \[R4\]. In June 2020, UltraSoC was <ins>acquired by Siemens</ins> \[S6\] to enable semiconductor industry customers overcome key pain points including manufacturing defects, software and hardware bugs, device early\-failure and wear\-out, functional safety, and malicious attacks \[S1\] and \[S3\]. \[S1\] confirms: 

 *‘The research undertaken by you and your EIS laboratory at the University Essex has provided the* 

 *technological foundations of the UltraSoC product portfolio and enabled us to build practical debug and analytic solutions which proved to be of such immense commercial and technological value they established UltraSoC as the world leading provider in the debug analytics and cybersecurity technology market. Consequently, UltraSoC was the company Siemens chose to acquire to achieve a step change in its activities in this market.’* \[S1\] 

 UltraSoC’s embedded analytics IP and debugging tools are used to monitor and boost the <ins>performance, reliability and safety</ins> of consumer electronics, safety\-critical vehicle electronics, AI chips, servers and high performance computing platforms. Early customer PMC\-Sierra, the fabless semiconductor company \(acquired by Microsemi in 2016\), used analytics and other monitoring tools within its disk drive controllers, which power a significant proportion of server chipsets globally. The monitors were used to collect detailed data on chip behaviour, while also shedding light on the performance of server infrastructure those SoCs support. “The hardware\-based approach can detect hard\-to\-identify issues \[making\] it substantially easier to home in on non\-fatal bugs.” \(see C23 of \[S2\]\). 

 <ins>Extensive licensing activity</ins> followed this breakthrough with PMC\-Sierra, with UltraSoC’s technology increasingly seen as the <ins>world leading on\-chip analytics capability</ins> to enable companies to bring their products to market rapidly, resulting in a series of technology licenses to global companies like ARM \(2016 see C20 of \[S2\]\), HiSilicon \(Huawei, 2016\), Esperanto \(2017, see C18 of \[S2\]\), Mircosemi \(2017\), Movidius \(Intel, 2016\), Alibaba \(2018, see C17 of \[S2\]\), Kraftway \(2018, see C15 of \[S2\]\), Seagate \(2019, see C9 of \[S2\]\) and Western Digital \(2019 see C9 of \[S2\]\). UltraSoC achieved 100% client retention; all licensees continued their engagement with UltraSoC, renewing and expanding their licenses. This was facilitated by its universal monitoring and analytic system to support rapid ‘plug and play’ integration of semiconductor IP blocks from different vendors \(e.g. processors from ARM, MIPS, RISC\-V etc.\), enabling to effectively support mixed IP SoCs with a minimum of engineering effort \(see C29 of \[S2\]\) and fully support this via respective tools integration through its partners Andes, Arm, Cadence/Tensilica, Imperas, Lauterbach, Mentor, Percepio, Segger, SiFive, and Sondrel \[S1\]. 

 UltraSoC’s technology has had a <ins>distinct impact</ins> on the economics of the semiconductor industry, where its “intelligent analytics’ closed the productivity gap created by the failure of traditional SoC development methodologies to keep pace with escalating systemic complexity. Providing engineering teams actionable insights that shorten the total development cycle time, accelerate debug, and reduce risk and cost to ensure timely market entry. Analysis from SemiCo research demonstrates the bottom\-line value of this approach – SoC design teams can <ins>double their profitability</ins> and <ins>reduce their development costs by a quarter</ins> by using UltraSoC \[S1\]. Thus, UltraSoC’s in chip monitoring is increasingly seen as an essential part of coping with “rising complexity and a spectrum of possible interactions” \(see C23 of \[S2\]\) which is particularly vital for the monitoring and analytics for automotive and safety\-critical systems, increasingly important for self\-driving and autonomous systems \(see C13 of \[S2\]\), where it is necessary to “adopt a new approach of looking inside the electronics.” With “On\-chip monitoring … allowing continuous measurement of previously\-inaccessible information … so that users can actually take corrective action at every stage.” \(see C25 of \[S2\]\). These on\-chip monitoring mechanism also provide <ins>key capabilities for systems level cybersecurity</ins> through its Lockstep Monitor \(See C22 of \[S2\]\) and its Sentinel technology \[S5 and S6\], this is also evidenced by UltraSoCs selection into the major DARPA Automatic Implementation of Secure Silicon programme to enable “scalable defence mechanisms into chip designs” \(see C30 of \[S2\]\). 

 Additionally, UltraSoC provides the only commercial grade debug solution for emerging ARM alternative Open Source processor core platform RISC\-V \(see C1 and C2 of \[S2\]\) with its “standards\-compliant RISC\-V trace solution is a <ins>major contribution</ins> … to create <ins>a comprehensive ecosystem</ins> that delivers robust, commercial grade open\-source platforms” \(C1 of \[S2\]\). 

 UltraSoC’s development of novel chip design technology which addresses the big problem of complex Integrated circuit design was recognised at the <ins>2015 Elektra Awards</ins>. At the European ‘Oscars’ of the electronic Industry, UltraSoC was named <ins>Best New Company</ins>. The judges were impressed by its partnerships with leading firms for its patented IC debug tools, which are already making an impact in global semiconductor markets. \[S4\] Its cybersecurity focused version of the technology was recognised with selection as finalist for the <ins>Embedded Solution Product of the Year</ins> in the 2020 Electronic Industry Awards \[S5\] and with the <ins>Best in Show Security Award</ins> at the globally leading <ins>Embedded World 2020</ins> trade show \[S6\]. 

 Finally, the General Manager, Siemens Digital Industries Software and Tessent Vice President confirms: “ *Siemens’ acquisition of UltraSoC means that for the first time our customers can access not just design\-for\-test, but a comprehensive ‘Design for Lifecycle Management’ solution for system\-on\-chips, including functional safety, security and optimization*,” Adding: “ *By utilizing design augmentation to detect, mitigate and eliminate risks throughout the SoC lifecycle, customers can radically improve time\-to\-revenue, product quality & safety, and profitability. UltraSoC has a fast\-growing business and impressive customer list and, as part of Siemens, can complement Tessent to create a truly unique offering in the market*.” \[S3\].  Siemens also confirms that “ *UltraSoC is a pioneer of embedding monitoring hardware into complex SoCs to enable “fab\-to\-field” analytics capabilities designed to accelerate silicon bring\-up, optimize product performance, and confirm that devices are operating “as designed” for functional safety and cybersecurity purposes*.” \[S3\]. All this from the company with a product portfolio founded on, and practical debug and analytic solutions enabled by research led by McDonald\-Maier at the University Essex \[S1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Liselle Terret’s practice\-based research has significant impact in three key areas, addressing ongoing systemic discrimination and exclusion of learning\-disabled and autistic \(LD and A\) people from the performing arts: 

  

-  championing inclusion through creative co\-production and inclusive programming; 

-  creating opportunities for learning\-disabled artists as theatre makers, through training, mentoring and partnerships for casting; 

-  promoting self\-representation and self\-advocacy for disabled people through policy and curriculum contributions that reach beyond national and disciplinary boundaries. 

  

 This work has been delivered through partnerships with the disability arts organisation Access All Areas \(AAA\) and commissions and productions at theatres including Soho Theatre, The Royal Court, and the South Bank Centre, and in TV/film through Netflix, Sky and the BBC.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 
Terret identifies as learning\-disabled, as a neuro\-divergent person with ADHD. Her work as a performance artist and director foregrounds this identification, disrupting theatrical norms through a radical Crip, queer, collaborative and feminist approach across her solo work, mentoring, consultancy, teaching, writing and directing.

Practice\-based research in the form of theatre\-making is complemented by writing, grounded in the ethic of care and collaboration, to bring the lived experience of disabled artists to the centre. These innovations led to new training pedagogies and creative opportunities for emancipatory self\-representation. The research was conducted in partnership with disabled artists, co\-constructing radically political questions about continued exclusion and discriminatory assumptions around binaries of ‘ability/disability’ \( **R1**\). 

  

 Terret’s work is driven by a central research enquiry framed by the following questions: 

1.  How can Crip and queer performance create an accessible aesthetic to engage the wider public / audiences in active considerations of their own lives? 

1.  How can theatre\-making processes be deployed to enable, include, champion, and celebrate neuro\-diverse and learning\-disabled artists as equals and as leaders in the industry and in training? 

1.  How can a new Crip theatre implicate audiences in challenging ongoing discrimination experienced by learning\-disabled people? 

  

 Through close engagement with Emancipatory Disability Research and the Political\-Relational Model of disability \(Kafer 2013\), Terret has developed a method that foregrounds learning disability or Crip aesthetics and re\-affirms the performer as creator and leader in authoring performance. The politics of disability arts lies at the heart of the practice\-as\-research: the practice is about visibility of agency and understanding the systems that reinforce discrimination \( **R2**\). 

  

 The primary work constituting this research includes co\-created theatre productions, articles and chapters, reports for the industry, training, consultation, national and international presentations, created by Terret with key partnerships and collaborations with the Disability Arts organisation Access All Areas, The British Council and The Live Art Development Agency \( **R3**, **R4**\). 

  

 A core company of artists \( *Not Your Circus Dog Collective*\), directed by Terret, developed through iterative process *Not F\*\*kin’ Sorry\! ,* a punk Crip queer theatre production drawing on the company’s lived experiences of disability discrimination. Terret’s research, bringing artists whose work usually falls outside dominant cultural markets to high profile stages \(The Royal Court, Soho Theatre, South Bank Centre\), challenges venues and audiences in their understanding of whose stories are told, and on which stages they are permitted \( **R5**, **R6**\). 

  

 Terret’s pioneering work demonstrates the potential of University research applied to the field of professional performing arts with radical activist intent. The methods and practices in performance forms devised by Terret resonates nationally and internationally through 

 collaborations across the sector.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Terret’s practice\-based methodologies for co\-creation with Learning Disabled and Autistic artists have led to impact in three key areas: 

  

1.  **Inclusion of LD and Autistic artists and audiences.** 

  

 **1.1 Creative co\-production**. Terret’s ongoing partnership with the arts organisation Access All Areas \(AAA\) has led to changes in the way that they work with and support artists **\(S1\)**. Creative support workers are now directly involved in the rehearsal room, and disabled artists are trained in leadership skills to enable self\-advocacy in and beyond the creative process. 

  

 **1.2 Inclusive programming**. Following Terret’s work at Southbank Centre, the Women of the World Festival now centres inclusion of LD and autistic artists at their global events, with further impacts on Southbank and WoW’s practice in terms of disability and access. Her collaborative work with the Royal Court Theatre in 2018 on *Take Up Space* cabaret has generated measures to forefront diversity and engage new audiences, including the creation of a new engagement producer role **\(S2\).** 

  

 **1.3 Inclusion by design.** Following collaborative work with Terret, industry professionals have adapted their practices to forefront access and inclusion, instigating new working methods to include disabled artists and audiences. These methods have been put into practice with: Paines Plough, Tamasha, Unicorn Theatre, Greenwich and Docklands International Festival, and through Hale’s work in access training with the FUEL Freelance Task Force **\(S3\)**. 

  

 **2. Opportunities and empowerment for LD and autistic artists.** 

  

 **2.1 Ensemble devising/Theatre creation with disabled artists**. *Not Your Circus Dog,* a disabled\-led company directed by Terret and co\-founded with Access All Areas, provides ongoing paid work for a group of 5 artists. Artists have developed professional level skills, and gained experience performing at venues including Soho Theatre, the Royal Court, The Royal Vauxhall Tavern, Southbank Centre and in the forthcoming BFI film ‘Girl Almighty’ \(£50k funding over 3 years\) 

  

 **2.2 New partnerships for diverse casting.** Terret’s consultancy with AAA and the Simon and How Agency has led to a branch of the company’s work that has diversified casting for film, TV and theatre \(800 days paid work for LD and A artists since 2017\). **\(S4\)** 

  

 **2.3 Training for LD and A artists in leadership skills.** Terret’s partnership with AAA and her contribution to their creative development work underpinned a new programme in leadership training for LD and A artists, leading to self\-advocacy, employment opportunities and representation in arts organisations across the UK \(ACE funded £285k, 2018\). **\(S5\)** 

  

 **2.4 Mentoring.** Terret provides mentoring and support to LD and autisticartists including Emma Selwyn, Adam Smith and DJ Hassan. Selwyn has gone on to devise and present solo shows, co\-facilitate training sessions, and co\-direct AAA projects. Selwyn and Terret have co\-authored an article exploring their collaborative Crip queer methods **\(R1,** **S6\)** and have co\-curated events for the Live Art Development Agency on performance and learning disability. 

  

 **3. Policy development and curriculum change, overcoming discriminatory practices for LD adults.** 

  

 **3.1** **Contribution to policy development.** Terret contributed to the British Council’s ‘Social Inclusion in the Performing Arts’ project with the Spanish Ministry of Culture, contributing to Spanish policy documents in 2018 **\(S7\).** Her research underpins an inhouse policy report on inclusion by AAA supported by Arts Council England for UK theatres. Her creative practice features in a report commissioned by Spectra on inclusion of LD and A artists. These reports have led to debate within the sector and their impacts have wide\-reaching implications for the social inclusion of LD and A artists **\(S8\)**. 

 **3.2 Curriculum development.** Terret’s work with AAA has contributed to developments in the Performance Making Diploma for Learning Disabled and Autistic Adults at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama through opportunities for an LD and A artist to co\-direct the diploma. New York University's Theatre department attest to her impact on their Applied Theatre curriculum: 

  

 *“Liselle Terret's ground\-breaking practice has inspired the NYU Educational Theatre Community, and her work has become a central component to our teaching and learning about Disability and Theatre”.* \( **S9**\). 

  

 **3.3 Informing practitioners.** Terret’s practice\-as\-research with Anna Clock has influenced Clock’s collaboration with Dr Lauren Sankary \(Neuroethicist, Cleveland Clinic USA\) training medical doctors at Columbia University on telehealth and listening \(USD160,000\). Terret’s work on sexuality, relationships and identity politics with LD and A artists has been adapted for use in a general support setting for LD and A adults in Israel \(Roni Ankari, Maas Rehovot\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The REMAP\-CAP is a novel adaptive platform trial created specifically to evaluate treatments in critically ill patients in intensive care during a pandemic. In COVID\-19, REMAP\-CAP recruited 614 patients to evaluate the use of intravenous hydrocortisone. The trial demonstrated that there was a 93% probability that hydrocortisone was superior to no hydrocortisone use in reducing mortality and the time receiving organ support in intensive care. These results were rapidly incorporated into treatment recommendations by the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\). Use of corticosteroids have become the standard of care around the world, improving survival in the sickest patients with COVID\-19 and saving hundreds of lives. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 REMAP\-CAP \(Randomised Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform for Community Acquired Pneumonia\) is an international adaptive platform trial that was designed specifically for pandemic preparedness. Since 2017 Professor Gordon has been the UK Chief Investigator for the trial and a member of the international trial steering committee. The trial has grown considerably since its initial European funding in 2014 and there are now over 300 participating sites across 21 countries including the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, Saudi Arabia and the US. 

 The trial was set\-up to evaluate treatments for community\-acquired pneumonia in critically ill patients. The protocol was designed to be modular and adaptive, so that if and when a pandemic occurred the existing protocol, regulatory approvals and trial infrastructure could be adapted to evaluate treatments for the pandemic infection rapidly. This was implemented in 2020 with the COVID\-19 outbreak \(1\). 

 Corticosteroids, specifically intravenous hydrocortisone, was one of the first interventions that the trial studied. The first patient was recruited on 9 March 2020, two days before the global pandemic was declared. At that time the UK had 13 Intensive Care Units \(ICU\) as potential recruiting sites. On 1 April the trial was categorised by the UK Chief Medical Officer as one of the UK’s national prioritised platform trials. Additional grant support was obtained from the NIHR. The central team were able to open recruitment to more than 100 UK ICUs within one month. 

 The corticosteroid intervention finished recruitment on 17 June 2020 when RECOVERY reported their dexamethasone result. RECOVERY is a platform study that examined dexamethasone as a treatment for hospitalised COVID\-19 patients outside of the ICU setting. After the RECOVERY report, the  blinded international trial steering committee for REMAP\-CAP decided to stop enrolment of patients due to a loss of equipoise, without reference to the REMAP\-CAP data. By this time REMAP\-CAP had recruited 614 patients with COVID\-19 in ICUs from 8 countries \(70% of patients were from the UK\); 403 patients were included in the corticosteroid analysis. 

 Although stopped early, the Bayesian design of REMAP\-CAP allowed a quantitative, easily interpreted, result to be reported. There was a 93% probability that giving hydrocortisone was superior to no hydrocortisone treatment, leading to more days alive and free of organ support in intensive care \(the primary outcome\). Additional pre\-specified secondary analyses demonstrated that for less sick patients, not requiring mechanical ventilation at inclusion, there was a 99% probability that hydrocortisone was beneficial, leading to far fewer patients \(30% reduction\) deteriorating to need intubation, extra\-corporeal membrane oxygenation or dying \(2\). 

 In view of the clinical imperative to share these important research results globally, REMAP\-CAP joined the WHO Rapid Evidence Appraisal for COVID\-19 Therapies \(REACT\) Working Group. The data were shared with the other investigators in the working group before publication. Data from all clinical trials of corticosteroids in severe COVID\-19 were combined. REMAP\-CAP was the second largest steroid trial in the world and contributed 53% of the patients to the hydrocortisone analysis. The analysis demonstrated that corticosteroids \(as a class of drug\) led to an absolute mortality reduction of 8%, from 40% in the control group to 32% in the treated patients \(3\). The results were similar for dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, demonstrating this is a class effect, which is important in a global pandemic to ensure adequate drug supplies; significantly, hydrocortisone can be used during pregnancy where dexamethasone is contra\-indicated.  It demonstrated that the general anti\-inflammatory mode of action is beneficial and that other similar anti\-inflammatory strategies \(e.g. interleukin\-6 inhibition with tocilizumab and sarilumab\) should be investigated. REMAP\-CAP was subsequently the first trial to demonstrate this in November 2020 \(https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/209033/arthritis\-drug\-effective\-treating\-sickest\-covid\-19/\)

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since its known emergence in December 2019, there have been over 83,000,000 COVID\-19 cases worldwide and over 1,800,000 deaths by the end of 2020, with over 120,000 deaths in the UK alone. From 1 September to end December 2020, during the second wave of COVID\-19, there were 12,000 COVID\-19 patient admissions to intensive care units in the UK. 

 Following publication of the REMAP\-CAP trial results in September 2020, the WHO published updated treatment guidelines for corticosteroids in COVID\-19 \[ **A**\]. The number one recommendation was “ *We recommend **systemic** **corticosteroids** rather than no corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID\-19 \(strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence\)*”. The REMAP\-CAP trial \(2, 3\) findings provided critical evidence for the use of hydrocortisone \[ **A**\]. 

 NHS Chief Executive, Sir Simon Stevens said, in response to the trial data published in reference \(2\) above, “ *One of the distinctive benefits of having our NHS is that we've been able to mobilise quickly and at scale to help researchers test and develop proven coronavirus treatments. Just as we did with dexamethasone, the NHS will now take immediate action to ensure that patients who could benefit from treatment with **hydrocortisone** do so, adding a further weapon in the armoury in the worldwide fight against Covid\-19.*” \[ **B**\]. 

 A Chief Medical Officer \(CMO\) Central Alerting System \(CAS\) alert \(Ref: CEM/CMO/2020/033\) was issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\) on 3 September 2020 \[ **C**\] stating “ *Corticosteroids, and in particular dexamethasone and **hydrocortisone**, have been demonstrated to have a place in the management of patients with COVID\-19. Following recent publication of the **REMAP\-CAP** trial for hydrocortisone and a meta\-analysis of corticosteroids, the World Health Organization \(WHO\) has recently issued new interim guidance recommending the use of systemic corticosteroids in severe and critical COVID\-19 disease.*” 

 NICE subsequently updated their COVID\-19 prescribing briefing for corticosteroids in line with the WHO recommendations \[ **D**\]. They recommend to “ *Offer dexamethasone or **hydrocortisone** to people with severe or critical COVID\-19*”. This briefing directly refers to the MHRA CMO CAS alert quoted above. 

 Using the UK as an example, there have been 12,000 ICU admissions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland due to COVID\-19 from 1 September to 31 December 2020 based on the Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre \(ICNARC\) report at that time. In the meta\-analysis described above mortality rates for this population were **reduced by 8%** with the treatment of steroids. This would equate to **approximately 960 lives saved in the last 4 months of 2020 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland alone** since this research was published. This improvement in survival is reflected in the latest outcome figures. In patients admitted to ICU for COVID\-19 before 31 August 2020 survival rates were 61% \(95%CI 60.1\-61.9\) at one month. For patients admitted from September to December 2020 **survival increased to 63.4%** \(95%CI 62.4\-64.4\) – this excludes patients who are still being cared for in ICU and will therefore change over time. 

 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

 Corticosteroids are now considered the standard of care for severely ill patients with COVID\-19 who require oxygen or mechanical ventilation. These drugs are inexpensive and widely available, so that all countries around the world can provide them, saving tens of thousands of lives.

 Prevailing approaches to public management have been based on principles of marketisation, management, and measurement. These are increasingly being seen to fail when faced with the complex world of public services. The Human Learning Systems \(HLS\) concept represents an alternative approach, one that embraces the complexity of the real world of organisations working to deliver social and welfare services. Research from Northumbria University has pioneered and rolled out HLS in the UK, as a result HLS has been adopted by local authorities across the UK, the NHS, and charitable foundations. Allocation of funding under this new approach amounts to over GBP169,000,000 and examples of resultant local service improvements include a 50% reduction in families occupying temporary bed and breakfast accommodation, fewer children in care, and improvements in employment and mental health.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The dominant management paradigm currently used for the public and voluntary sector – known as ‘new public management’ \(NPM\) – fails to respond effectively to the challenges of complex 21<sup>st</sup> century services for care and welfare. NPM uses contract\-based target\-setting and performance measurement processes to commission and determine the effectiveness of service outcomes. It is widely acknowledged that this creates perverse incentives for organisations to manipulate the targets in an increasingly complex environment \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. Northumbria’s research has developed, trialled, and rolled out an alternative approach to service commissioning, delivery, and performance management. This is known as the Human, Learning, Systems approach \(HLS\) \[ **R2**\]. 

 Building on Northumbria’s strong track\-record of public management research, in 2018 the Business School formed a ‘complexity and learning group’ funded by Big Lottery Fund, Lankelly Chase Foundation, and the Tudor Trust \[ **G1**\- **G3**\]. The group comprised 5 researchers, though this has now grown to 11. Much of the work they undertake is on\-going, co\-produced action research with groups of service providers such as adult social care, health, and financial support. Here, the research activities support organisations to experiment with the new approaches to service delivery that the group helps them to create \[ **R2**\]. 

 HLS has been informed by ongoing academic work in the challenges of performance management for service organisations. The group conducted a comparison of two models of social prescribing \(interventions that improve health and wellbeing of service users\) in Northern England. The work interpreted approaches to commissioning and delivering the services to identify and critique features of NPM. One method focused on measurements of improved outcomes, the other – more traditionally – measured the success of outputs or processes. Assessment showed that both methods were subject to the ‘tyranny of targets’ and recommended that a more nuanced approach to outcomes measurement and performance management could maintain the relationship and trust\-based aspects throughout the life\-cycle of commissioning and delivery, making outcomes less important as performance targets and more as a tool for learning and development \[ **R3**\]. 

 Researchers took this forward using complexity theory, which looks at how organisations adapt to their environments and how they cope with uncertainty, to put in place systems to learn and improve. This was achieved through action research with over 300 public and voluntary sector organisations in the UK, USA, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, through a consultative process including master classes, online forums, horizontal engagement between organisations \[ **R1**, **R2**\], and supported by a programme of evaluation \[ **R4**\]. This work resulted in the ‘human, learning, systems’ approach \(HLS\). In contrast with results\-based management approaches, HLS adopts the view that the outcomes public service organisations are commissioned to deliver are not independently produced by those designing interventions or services – but rather come from the systems in which they are embedded \[ **R5**\]. 

 The HLS \(‘Be Human, Learn Together. Change the System’\) framework is based on three key principles: 

 **\(1\) Human** – This element challenges a managerial and metric\-focused approach by acknowledging the strengths, capabilities, and practice of the people involved, stressing the importance of relationships – particularly with service\-users. This suggests service delivery should be more human\-centred, building on intrinsic motivations of those involved. This is encapsulated as VEST – variety, empathy, strengths, and trust \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. 

 **\(2\) Learning** – With a learning focus, work is not about delivering a standardised service, but is instead a continuous process of learning which allows service providers to adapt to the changing strengths and needs of each person with whom they work. This approach challenges narrow forms of accountability based on targets and tick boxes. To meet this challenge, organisations recognise the multiple dimensions of accountability and explore who needs to provide what kind of account to whom. This process involves dialogue, not just data, is an experimental approach, and requires a move to funding learning, not services \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. 

 **\(3\) Systems** – To be successful, complex, often place\-based systems need to be the basis for interventions, not single projects, or organisations \[ **R5**\]. This requires trust between actors, establishing shared principles, values and behaviours, and the addition of stewarding roles to manage governance complexity between participating organisations \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. 

 This conceptual framework has been applied within funding and service delivery organisations. The researchers conducted work for the Lankelly Chase Foundation \[ **G1**, **G2**\] which explored the application of the HLS approach within towns and cities in the UK, including Manchester, Barrow\-in\-Furness, and York. This used the concept of ‘place’ to identify a set of findings around actors, power and relationships, the learning journey, roles, and functions, which enabled them to identify lessons for using learning to create change, as well as the challenges around uncertainty, resources, and motivations of the actors \[ **R4**\]. 

 By sharing the results of this action\-research process with wider public and voluntary sector actors and building a community of practice of organisations advocating for change – embracing more than 360 organisations in UK, USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand – the HLS framework is shifting understanding of how public management should be undertaken.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Northumbria team worked closely with organisations, including councils/local authorities, the NHS, and charitable bodies to help them adopt an HLS approach to public management in their strategies and ways of working. This new approach has brought efficiency benefits to many of the organisations and changed public services \(including delivery\) leading to improved health and wellbeing for service users. It has influenced commissioning and funding, local public service infrastructure, and the practices involved in managing and delivering public services. These include work with voluntary and community sector organisations \(VCSOs\). More than GBP169,000,000 of public and charitable funding is now managed under HLS principles. Some examples are outlined here. 

 **4.1 Improved commissioning and delivery of public services by using HLS** 

 Northumbria researchers worked with Plymouth Council \(260,000 population, annual spend GBP600 million\) to develop a whole\-systems approach to public service which prioritises learning as a mechanism for change. The adoption of HLS has changed the way the Council manages and commissions *‘significant elements’* of its public services \[ **E1**\]. This led to the creation of a new, ten\-year, GBP77,000,000 budget to provide a support system for vulnerable adults. This replaces 29 separate service contracts previously used. Plymouth Alliance was commissioned to undertake this work from April 2019. The commissioning contract focuses on learning and collaboration and is free from KPIs and other standard performance management mechanisms \[ **E1**\]. 

 In May 2020, Gary Wallace from Plymouth Alliance reported on how the HLS approach had changed its ways of working *‘everybody has been fundamentally changed by this in terms of how we see ourselves, our roles and our work. What it’s really done is exposed how much effort in a system is to do with responding to organisation need rather than to real need… It also had placed all the values we enshrined in our contract, front and centre, so things like kindness, empathy, openness and trust’* \[ **E2**, p9\]. 

 This change has led to a more efficient method of working and cost savings of over GBP750,000 per year with no reduction in quality or quantity of service. In fact, the service can now support more people in need \[ **E1**\]. This has resulted in decreased waiting times for drug and alcohol treatment programmes and a cut in the numbers of homeless families in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation by \~50% \[ **E1**\]. The Director of Public Health at Plymouth Council confirmed that *‘Our action\-research relationship with Dr Lowe and his team has been invaluable in the creation of our alternative approach to public management’* \[ **E1**\]. The work has been applied to other services including place based, child obesity, smoking cessation, and public health education messaging during COVID 19 \[ **E1**\]. 

 In 2018, Dr Toby Lowe was retained as a consultant for Gateshead Council’s Public Service Reform \(120,000 population, annual spend GBP200 million\). This led to new prototypes for public service working based on the HLS principles of forming effective human relationships. The work centred on council tax debt recovery, homelessness, and neighbourhood working. This represented an investment of GBP1,500,000 by Gateshead Council in the HLS approach \[ **E3**\] and over GBP60,000,000 in using the HLS approach to commission public services for Information Advice and Guidance, Adult Social Care, and Learning Disability \[ **E3**\]. The development of the HLS approach enables these services to adapt to the diverse and changing needs of the people in Gateshead and they are confident that this will result in millions of pounds of cost savings as the prototypes become standard practice \[ **E3**; **E4**, p70\]. 

 The new services have already led to: improved employment rates for people that saw little prospect of ever working; reduced interventions by the care system, meaning less children going into care; reduced levels of debt and increased income; and, improved mental health \[ **E3**\]. Mark Smith, Director of Public Service Reform at Gateshead Council confirmed that *‘The Gateshead prototypes have, according to citizens themselves, led to a material improvement in their lives and prospects in over 70% of cases, having been either ignored by or bounced around the confusing configuration of services hitherto’* \[ **E3**\]. 

 The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority \(CA\) was awarded GBP7,700,000 to develop a Housing First pilot across the city region. Housing First requires a system change to the prevailing approaches to homelessness and as such, a change in the way in which commissioning of homelessness services is carried out. Therefore, the CA has embraced HLS as an approach to commissioning and as a tool with which to understand the current homelessness system and to create change \[ **E5a**, p1; **E5b**, p1\]. One example of commissioning services in this way is the Assertive Outreach service, a GBP675,000 contract \[ **E5a**, p4\] which demonstrates HLS principles including a learning approach to contract management and the appointment of a ‘systems steward’ \[ **E5b**\]. *‘This approach results in better experiences, better outcomes and it has potential to increase collaboration, enable innovation, build employee motivation, and deliver cost savings’* \[ **E5b**, p2\]. 

 Collaborative Newcastle – a partnership comprising Newcastle Council, Newcastle\-Gateshead clinical commissioning group, and Cumbria, Northumberland, and Tyne & Wear Mental Health Trust – works to service more than 1.5 million NHS patients every year. Since 2019, Lowe has worked with Collaborative Newcastle. The Chair of Collaborative Newcastle stated: *‘Using Dr. Lowe’s work, we have developed a health, wealth and wellbeing strategy for the city, and an underpinning ‘Being Well’ approach to service redesign which is built explicitly on the Human Learning Systems approach*’ \[ **E6**\]. The strategy encapsulated in The Joint Executive Briefing Note from 31 January 2020 \[ **E7**\], adopting the HLS approach, underpins tens of millions of pounds of investment in improving support for people with complex needs, hospital discharge, and ‘care at home’ services \[ **E6**\]. 

 More broadly, Impower, the largest public sector management consultancy in the UK, worked with Lowe to adopt the HLS approach as part of its new Edgework Manifesto \[ **E8**, p140\]. Impower works with more than 140 Local Authorities in the UK to create change in public service delivery. It now offers HLS as an approach to use with its clients. 

 Internationally, the Exploring the New World report \[ **R1**\] has had a significant influence with the Australian Treasury who used it to develop a design approach in its ‘Systems\-led design guide’ to embed systems\-led design methodologies and techniques \[ **E9**, p67\] in *‘day\-to\-day work to help us understand, document and communicate the complexity of the tax and superannuation systems’* \[ **E9**, p9\]. 

 **4.2 Improved distribution and effectiveness of charitable funding by using HLS** 

 Lankelly Chase is an independent charitable foundation which works across the UK to change systems that perpetuate disadvantage. It invests GBP5,000,000 annually in grant funding and commissioning via its partners. In 2018, the organisation commissioned Lowe to become a partner on its Place Action Inquiry. The Inquiry supported partners to develop the HLS approach to improve the ways they support people who experience severe and multiple disadvantages. It will run over a ten\-year period with an expected budget of GBP5,000,000. The initial GBP1,000,000 investment means that: Greater Manchester Combined Authority has developed new co\-production commissioning procedures; for the first time, organisations that support adults with complex needs in York have come together to create a new learning infrastructure; and commissioning in Gateshead Council and Clinical CG now focuses on learning rather than performance management \[ **E10**\]. 

 Tudor Trust is a UK\-wide charitable foundation that in 2019 distributed \~GBP18,000,000 to more than 300 organisations to support communities to drive their own positive change. Tudor has also adopted the HLS principles and uses it with its grant holders, with relationships at the foundation of everything the Trust does \[ **E2**, p2\-3\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Cartwright’s research is shifting thinking and practice in the evidence\-based policy movement from its focus on randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\) to more context\- and user\-centred approaches that make use of additional methods and information to improve policy\-effectiveness, evaluation and prediction. This is transforming the policy landscape in four key areas. 

-  International development: e.g. in the government’s Department for International Development’s \(DFID’s\) Centre for Excellence for Development Impact & Learning \(CEDIL\) 

-  Medicine: e.g. in the UK Academy of Medical Sciences’ *Sources of evidence for assessing the safety, efficacy and effectiveness of medicines* 

-  Education: Uptake of ideas from Cowen and Cartwright’s *Making the Most of the Evidence in Education: A Guide for Working Out What Works...Here and Now* 

-  Child protection: writing with the author of the United Kingdom government’s 2011 *Munro Review of Child Protection*

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The bulk of Cartwright’s philosophical research has been devoted \- through her ‘Knowledge for Use’ grant \- to changing the thinking of those within the ‘evidence\-based policy’ \(EBP\) movement. This influential movement aims to improve public policy by taking a systematic, evidence\-based approach to decision\-making. It is now highly influential, involving 11 ‘What Works’ Centres in the UK including The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\), the World Health Organization \(WHO\) and the USA Department of Education ‘What Works Clearing House’. 

 Within the EBP movement, thinking and practice about the relationship between evidence and policy is almost universally ‘intervention\-centred’, focussing on randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\) and meta\-analyses. Cartwright’s research on causal inference advocates a shift in thinking to a more ‘context\-centred’ approach that makes use of additional methods and kinds of information. The research concerns what kinds of information can provide reliable inference about causation, especially in policy settings. The principal results are: 1\) An analysis of possible roles of RCTs \[R1\]; 2\) an account of types of evidence for causation in the single case \[R2\]; 3\) an analysis of the role of mixed methods, middle\-level theory and process tracing \[R3\] ; 4\) an account of what constitutes a good scientific model for causal prediction, resulting in a more usable and predictively effective theory about the form of ‘theories of change’ \[R4\]; 5\) the development of a context\- versus intervention\-centred approach to policy\-effectiveness, evaluation and prediction \[R5\]. 

 Together these research strands provide a new way of looking at how evidence should be used in deliberating policy effectiveness that is beginning to have effects within the EBP movement, in getting advocates and institutions to lay more stress on *moderator* \(or *support\) variables*, *interrupters*, *off\-setters* and the middle\-level principles that govern the production of one stage from the previous, on using and synthesising a greater variety of methods for stabilising evidence for policy effectiveness, and on guidance for building context\-local causal models. These are general lessons that hold across substantive domains from development policy to medicine to education, in all of which excessive emphasis has been put on RCTs at the expense of the social, economic and political information necessary for reliable policy prediction. 

 The underpinning research is reported in a bundle of closely interrelated works on evidence for deliberation and evaluation in the policy arena. It consists primarily of analysis, including case studies, with results published in professional papers, conference talks, committee reports and in 1\-on\-1 work with individuals.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of Cartwright’s research is on EBP advocates and practitioners; social scientists whose work intersects on\-the\-ground policy; and those who make and/or implement policy, especially in international development, medical sciences, education and child protection. Cartwright’s research has shifted the thinking that guides their practice from an intervention\-centred approach to a more context\-centred one. This has been achieved through her work with international research centres, national academies and through presentations at social science and policy venues \[E1\]. 

1.  **International Development** 

 The Centre of Excellence for Development Impact and Learning \(CEDIL\) is an independent international research centre established to improve impact evaluations and evidence synthesis in international development. It was funded in 2017 by the UK Department for International Development \(DFID\) to commission GBP10,000,000 of research in three areas. One area, ‘Generalising evidence through middle\-range theory’ was chosen in part because of Cartwright’s defence – through her role on CEDIL’s Intellectual Leadership Team – of its importance for policy evaluation, following research reported in \[R4\]. This resulted in the following CEDIL publications and policy documents \(all \[E2\]\), based primarily on Cartwright’s research on middle\-range theory \(MRT\) from \[R4\] and context\-centred prediction \(CCP\) from \[R5\]: 

-  ‘Making Predictions of Programme Success More Reliable’, Cartwright’s work on MRT formed the basis for this publication, commissioned to set the model for the empirical projects to be funded by CEDIL. \[E2\] 

-  ‘Using Middle\-Level Theory to Improve Programme and Evaluation Design’. This CEDIL\-commissioned publication uses Cartwright’s work on MRT to specify guidelines for subsequent programme evaluation and design. \[E2\] 

-  ‘Designing evaluations to provide evidence to inform action in new settings’. This policy document defends the need for MRT, and offers a discussion of the importance of \(Cartwright’s idea of\) ‘markers’, following \[R5\]. \[E2\] 

-  ‘Stakeholder Engagement for Development Impact Evaluation and Evidence Synthesis’. Cartwright’s research on CCP influenced the discussions of ‘local knowledge’ in this policy document. \[E2\] 

-  ‘Gaps in Evaluation Methods for Addressing Challenging Contexts in Development’. One of the two central themes in this policy document is the importance of MRT. This publication also cautions about external validity and the problems in understanding mechanisms outlined in \[R4\]. \[E2\] 

 Testimonials by CEDIL associates further evidence Cartwright’s influence on CEDIL’s leadership team and policy documents: “CEDIL is a multi\-disciplinary project but we had no one with a philosophy of science background, and certainly no one with Nancy's stature… Nancy became a core team member… Nancy's contribution… led us to focus on a middle range theory \(MRT\) approach. MRT is emerging as a strong part of CEDIL's brand, which I strongly doubt would have been the case without Nancy's involvement. The better designed evaluations and reviews which can result from this approach, and the better use of the evidence they provide, will enable implementers to design interventions which are more likely to have the desired effect. Better studies, better policies and programmes and better lives.” 

 \[E3\]. 

 In addition to her work with CEDIL, individual statements by development EBP practitioners provide further evidence to support the breadth and significance of Cartwright’s influence within international development. A member of the board of Civil Society group, INTRAC, an adviser to Self Help Africa, and developer of the Qualitative Impact Protocol \(QuIP\), explained: “Nancy has been a helpful source of ideas and advice in development and more particularly commercial testing of \[QuIP\].” \[E3\] 

 Additionally, the lead Social Scientist in Development Research at the World Bank comments on: “… the many and varied ways in which Nancy’s mind, words, temperament, wisdom and presence has found practical application in the world of international development.” Especially significant, he writes, are “Nancy’s co\-authored papers with economist and Nobel Prize winner Angus Deaton \[R1\] on the \(many\) limits of randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\)…. This combination of ‘star power’ has been central to delimiting the otherwise unbridled, uncritical and unwarranted enthusiasm… for a narrow, singular approach to research, causal inference and \(thus\) applications to policy and practice.” \[E3\] 

1.  **Medicine** 

 Cartwright was invited to serve on a working group of one of the UK’s 4 national academies, the *Academy of Medical Sciences*. This is an independent body, funded by grants from the Departments of Health, and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Their mission is to advance biomedical and health research and to more effectively translate that research into social benefit. Cartwright’s work on RCT’s \- in particular \[R1\] \- contributed directly to the final report of their ‘Methods of Evaluating Evidence’ working group concerning the efficacy and assessment of medicines \[E4\]. The committee chair stated that: “\[Cartwright’s\] writings have certainly influenced my thinking about causation when applied to practical problems… \[E\]veryone on the working party producing the 2017 report learnt a lot about the practical implications of the theoretical issues.  We came to think differently about things as a result of what Nancy Cartwright had to say.” \[E5\] 

 In addition to her work with the Academy of Medical Sciences, Cartwright has also worked extensively with a psychotherapist \-\- CBE, adviser to the government on evaluating the effectiveness of psychological therapy services, national expert adviser to NICE on depression, and research evaluator on the Greater Manchester *Working Well* Programme – who has used Cartwright’s work on the limits of RCTs \[R1\] and on the importance of mixed methods for establishing effectiveness \[R3\], to argue both at NICE and with the government’s Work and Health Unit for a broader approach to evaluating treatment effectiveness, as well as in devising an evaluation study of *Working Well*. He comments: “The work I have been able to do with the support of Nancy’s research is being seen by policy makers and leaders in the professional and research field as some of the most important research in mental health in the UK.” \[E5\] 

1.  **Education** 

 With Nick Cowen, Cartwright published *Making the Most of the Evidence in Education: A Guide for Working Out What Works...Here and Now* \[E6\]. This guide uses Cartwright’s work on evidence and the evaluation of policy \- \[R2\], \[R3\], \[R5\] \- to advise practitioners on the use of research evidence about education. This guide has impacted education policy through its use by the Education Endowment Foundation \(EEF\). The EEF is an independent charity, founded by the Department of Education in 2011 with a GBP125,000,000 grant aimed to help raise standards in challenging schools by using the best available research and evidence to raise attainment and close the disadvantage gap. Their 2017 annual report into improving literacy in Key Stage 2 \[E4.2\] – targeted at teachers, senior leaders and educational professionals – uses Cartwright and Cowen’s \[E6\] in providing advice on the applicability of structured programs based on research\-evidence for targeted interventions \(in the specific context of helping pupils who are struggling with literacy\). 

 The use of Cartwright’s research to inform education policy has also enjoyed international reach. With Kathryn Joyce, Cartwright published ‘Bridging the Gap Between Research and Practice: Predicting What Will Work Locally’ \[E8\]; an application of Cartwright’s work on evidence and prediction and RCT’s, \[R2\] and \[R5\] to the evaluation of research evidence in education policy. This led to a consultation with Cartwright and Joyce by the head of the US ‘What Works Clearing House’, which is a Centre of the Institute of Education Sciences, in the US Department of Education. The impact of Cartwright’s research in the US is further evidenced by the testimony of the former head of the US National Research Council’s Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education: 

 “\[Cartwright’s\] work has been among the crispest, most influential, and most relevant… on topics ranging from public health to climate to economic and social welfare to education… Nancy has established herself as a “go\-to” authority on anything related to the nature of inference, the connection of causal reasoning to ex ante planning and ex post evaluation, and to the benefits and risks of either ignoring or overstating findings from scientific research. As a practitioner of evidence, all this matters to me greatly... I have been working in the hazardous intersection of research and practice for nearly 4 decades, with 24 years divided between a scientific arm of the US Congress and the National Academy of Sciences. In the former agency \(the now defunded Office of Technology Assessment\), I was study director for projects on topics of education, psychological testing, and learning technology; at the 

 NAS I founded the Board on Testing and Assessment and eventually became the Executive Director of the Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education Division… Now when I consider starting a new project that calls on research to inform policy or practice, one of the first people I call on – for advice or participation – is of course Professor Cartwright.” \[E9\] 

1.  **Child protection** 

 Cartwright’s work on evidence evaluation and policy \- \[R2\], \[R3\] \- led to the publication, with Eileen Munro, Jeremy Hardie and Eleonora Montuschi, of *Improving Child Safety: deliberation, judgement and empirical research* \[E10\] \(a guide for those working in child protection and child welfare to deliberate about interventions using the available evidence\). This has heavily informed a leading child protection expert and government advisor’s \(\-\- CBE\) pioneering work with an international child\-protection programme, *Signs of Safety* \(SoS\), that focuses on partnerships between professionals, families and children: “Developments in the theoretical foundations of Signs of Safety have been influenced by… Nancy’s work on causal processes so that the Theory of Change now covers both the direct work with families and the organisation’s contribution to the performance of the front line worker. Nancy’s work on support factors, detractors and derailers provided the conceptual framework for measuring the individual local authorities’ progress on implementing the reforms and explaining the markedly different levels of practice achieved.” \[E10\]. SoS has now been implemented in more than 100 jurisdictions worldwide, and is used in approximately two\-thirds of local authorities in England and nationwide in Ireland in 2017 following a Department of Education Funded \(GBP4,600,000\) ‘Innovation Programme’.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Through direct engagement with the Scottish Parliament and the media \(including 16 newspaper articles and a live TV debate\), Webster’s research at the University of Cambridge was instrumental in repealing the **Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications \(Scotland\) Act 2012** \(hereafter *OBFA*\) on 15/3/18. Key stakeholders include all football fans in Scotland, Police Scotland, Irish\-migrant populations, and civil liberty groups UK\-wide. Since repeal, ‘at risk’ football fans \(mostly young men from deprived communities\) will no longer have their prospects blighted by criminal records classing them as sectarian offenders. Webster’s research called for non\-legislative solutions to sectarianism via early years education, leading the Scottish Government to allocate GBP530,000 to anti\-sectarianism education in 2019 \[E1\]. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Working as a Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge \(2011\-2013\), Webster engaged in ethnographic research on the Orange Order in Scotland, including 13 months of immersive, full\-time fieldwork. In addition to 44 ethnographic interviews, Webster undertook in\-depth participant observation among Orangemen and Rangers Football Club \(RFC\) supporters in an Orange Social Club. Webster made 12 trips to Scotland’s Grand Orange Lodge, attended 11 loyalist parades, six loyalist street protests, five Orange church services, and 20 other loyalist events \(totalling 1500\+ hours of observation and 200,000\+ words of fieldnotes\). Webster also took 3000\+ photos of Orange parades, recorded 43\+ hours of audio \(interviews, speeches, and sermons\), and analysed 350\+ documents. He also conducted a week of interviews among Orangemen in N. Ireland, and comparative fieldwork on Irish republicanism in Scotland. 

 This 2011\-13 ethnography provided the foundational empirical data for Webster’s policy engagement on the *OBFA* – data analysed and interpreted in conversation with Prof. Robbins \(Anthropology, Cambridge\), Dr Jenkins \(Divinity, Cambridge\), and Dr Wydra \(Politics, Cambridge\). Webster’s research, published as a 110,000 word monograph \[R1\], was of particular relevance to his case for repeal of the *OBFA*, and, post\-repeal, to his advocacy of non\-legislative solutions to football sectarianism via early\-years education \[E6\]. 

 In the **Introduction** and **Chapter 1** of *The religion of Orange politics*, Webster reassesses the role of religious hate in human experience, arguing that hate is embraced as a social and moral good by fans engaging in sectarian football chanting. **Chapter 2** examines attitudes to hate crime, analysing the impact of the Orange/loyalist contention that Catholic perpetrators are excused while Protestant victims are ignored. **Chapter 3** traces extensive institutional and cultural connections between Rangers supporters and the Orange Order, explaining how the exclusionary nature of their shared ultra\-British and ultra\-Protestant ideology shapes public debate about sectarianism at football matches and Orange parades. **Chapter 4** analyses Orange expressions of sectarianism in relation to football fandom and fraternal drinking, presenting new data on football chanting as it was policed before the repeal of the *OBFA*. **Chapter 5** documents how religion and football fandom influenced loyalist/republican voters during the Scottish independence referendum, tracing links between Scottish unionists, Rangers fans, and loyalist paramilitaries in N. Ireland. The **Conclusion** analyses sectarian football fandom and expressions of British\-Protestant chosenness to reveal the theological roots of Orange claims to being a ‘race apart’ – an exclusionary process that, Webster argues, was exacerbated by *OBFA*\-led policing, because RFC fans who felt unfairly targeted by the leglislation further intensified intra\-group bonding via heightened sectarian chanting. In sum, Webster contends that policies which restrict sectarian expression are designed by politicians who misunderstand why individuals value hate – a situation which rendered the *OBFA* a counterproductive failure. 

 Webster has been invited to present his research on the *OBFA* at international conferences, including to the *Football Collective* \(where UK/Irish academics and policy makers discuss football and social policy\), as well as to an *Anthropology of Christianity* conference in Zurich. Demonstrating impact work feeding back into research, both of these papers were based on data gathered as a consequence of Webster’s prior invitation to submit a policy report to the Scottish Government’s **Independent Advisory Group on Hate Crime, Prejudice and Community Cohesion**.* Webster was also invited to present his new theorisation of ‘The Good’ of hate within the Orange Order to the *American Anthropological Association* \(Denver\) – a foundational argument to his parliamentary testimony \[E4\] about the failure of the *OBFA*.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Webster did not embark on research with RFC fans with plans for policy engagement on sectarian football disorder. Instead, this issue arose organically from ethnographic engagement with Orangemen and RFC fans concerned about the negative impact of the *OBFA* \[R1\]. Webster was asked by the Scottish Government Justice Committee to give expert testimony about repeal based on this ethnography conducted primarily in 2011\-13. 

 **4.1 Impact: Pre\-Repeal** 

 Webster’s ethnographic study of religious identity politics within the Orange Order \[R1 *passim*\] initially contributed to the Scottish Government’s **Independent Advisory Group on Hate Crime, Prejudice and Community Cohesion** \(10/9/16\). Webster was asked to write a report to the Chair of the Advisory Group \(Prof. Duncan Morrow\) on hate crime, community cohesion and the Old Firm, and later submitted evidence \(now published on the Scottish Government website\) to the Justice Committee on the proposed repeal of the *OBFA  \[E2\]. 

 Webster’s written Justice Committee evidence was subsequently quoted in an article in the **Express newspaper \(20/8/17\) about the *OBFA* as it relates to anti\-Semitism: 

 *“Dr Joseph Webster \[argues\]… it is ‘legally and practically impossible’ to legislate against people chanting on football terraces, in pubs or in the streets, adding: ‘To do so would require mass arrests of hundreds if not thousands of people… – a situation that few members of Scottish civil society would consider practical or desirable. In short, “offensive behaviour” as defined by the 2012 Act … requires cultural change, not legislation.’”* \[E3\] 

 Even at this pre\-repeal stage, Webster’s research was influencing debates beyond football sectarianism, about religious hate as it pertains to UK\-wide concerns about anti\-Semitism. 

 **4.2 Impact: During Repeal** 

 Following this submission, Webster was invited to appear before the **Scottish Government Justice Committee** to give oral evidence on repeal \(14/11/17\). Webster was questioned extensively over 82 minutes \(see video \[E4\] and transcript \[E2\]\). Webster outlined his case for repeal, arguing that the legislation was unenforceable, unjustified on free speech grounds, and based on a misunderstanding of football chanting as inter\-group rivalry rather than as fostering intra\-group solidarity \[R1 Chapter 4 and Conclusion\]. Those on both sides praised the usefulness of Webster’s evidence. Justice Committee member **Fulton MacGregor MSP**, who opposed repeal, described Webster’s evidence as providing new insight: 

 *“It was to pick up on a point that Dr Webster made … it’s the first time we have heard that angle on things, that actually people who are engaging in \[illegal\] songs and behaviour are doing so to their own fans and supporters. … your point was well made and it was made in a different way that we haven’t heard before … It was interesting to hear that angle*.” \[E2\] 

 Likewise, **James Kelly MSP**, leading the repeal effort, praised Webster’s evidence: 

 *“Your evidence at the committee was very impressive and helpful to my case. The fact that you were able to back up views with such a strong evidence base added good quality to your oral and written submission. This is very useful as source points in the Justice Committee reports and parliamentary debates that will follow.”* \[E5\] 

 Following this oral evidence, Webster’s contributions were quoted extensively in the **Justice Committee Stage 1 Report on Repeal**: \(i\) regarding what ‘message’ repeal would send to those who engage in sectarian behaviour \(§76, p. 23\), \(ii\) how certain football fans believe themselves to be unfairly targeted by the legislation \(§89, p. 27\), \(iii\) how the legislation is unjustified on free speech grounds \(§97, pp. 29\-30\), and \(iv\) on the definition of sectarianism \(§178, p. 58\). Webster’s quoted contributions totalled over 640 words of the report \[E2\]. 

 Following this, Webster’s evidence was twice quoted by **Liam Kerr MSP** during the Scottish Parliament’s **Stage 1 Debate**, firstly on the social impact of repealing the *OBFA* \[E2\]: 

 *“Dr Webster said that repeal does not mean affirming the validity of… proscribed behaviour. He considered that how repeal is perceived is all our collective responsibility. He is right: it is all our duty to send a message that hate crime is illegal—and still will be.”* 

 And secondly on how the law changed fan behaviour without reducing sectarianism \[E2\] *:* 

 *“Dr Webster said: ‘What fans have done is change their behaviour by holding their hands in front of their mouths while singing certain songs in order to prevent CCTV from capturing them… replac\[ing\] certain songs and chants with other words in order to skirt the law.’”* 

 Following Stage 2 \(suggested amendments to the legislation\), the Scottish Parliament moved to **Stage 3 to debate and vote on Repeal**. During this debate, Webster’s research and oral and written evidence was again quoted by Liam Kerr MSP \[E2\]: 

 *“Webster told the committee: ‘The 2012 act has made the policing of sectarianism more difficult, because fans have got wise to how to circumvent the law.’ Worse, he went on to say: ‘it has led to a deterioration in relationships between the fan bases and between them and the police.’ …Webster was clear in saying to the Justice Committee: ‘Has the singing decreased? No, it has been redirected. Is the law working? No, we need to replace it with other methods of behavioural change… \[namely\] early years education.’”* 

 **Maurice Corry MSP** also quoted Webster’s evidence \[E2\]: “ *Dr Joseph Webster …—and he should know—also told the committee that ‘the act is not justified on free speech grounds.’”* 

 Following this debate, a vote on Repeal was held, with 62 for repeal and 60 against. As advocated for by Webster’s evidence, the legislation was formally repealed on 15/3/18. 

 During this time, Webster also engaged extensively with the media on the repeal debate. On 10/3/18, the **Herald** \(Scotland’s largest newspaper; circulation 28,900\), ran a front\-page story \(above and below fold\) on Webster’s research under the headline “ *Sectarianism at football is about tribal solidarity, says academic.*” This 275\-word article discussed Webster’s analysis of football sectarianism as motivated by intra\-group solidarity \[cf. R1 Chapter 4 and Conclusion\]. This front\-page article was followed by a 700\-word article in the same edition \(page 3\) titled “ *Sectarianism among fans is kept in their own tribe, says academic.*” This article examined Webster’s research \[R1\] in more detail, accompanied by a 230\-word supporting article on falling conviction rates using the *OBFA*. Webster also had a 600\-word op\-ed in the same edition titled “ *Scrap Act that misses point on reality of sectarianism”* \[E6\]. 

 These articles were picked up by three other newspapers, with the **Sun** \(circulation 1,496,558\), the **Evening Times** \(circulation 23,696\) and the **National** \(circulation 8,500\) running stories on his research \[E6\]. The *Evening Times* article provoked significant reaction in Scotland and internationally. **FollowFollow* \(the leading RFC forum\) debated it in the thread “A leading academic's take on sectarian chanting”, as did **Gersnet** and **Kerrydale Street** \(RFC/Celtic FC forums\) and **Qiumi.de**, a German Bundesliga forum. Jeanpaulvalley commented “ *Good article \- rare common sense from academia*”; Cross Keys Rab stated “ *That's probably the closest opinion I've read to actual reality that you'll find anywhere*” \[E7\]. The **Herald** profiled Webster’s research again a week later \(17/3/18\), this time on page 2. This 660\-word article reported on Webster’s findings about the difficulty of voluntarily maintaining ethno\-religious segregation in Scotland, as compared with N. Ireland \[R1 Chapter 1\]. The article profiled Webster’s call for anti\-sectarian initiatives to refocus on early years education \[cf. R1 Chapter 2\] rather than the current proposals for new legislation \[E6\]. Thus, in addition to repeal, Webster’s research fostered new debates about the behavioural causes and effects of sectarianism, offering a new framework for a post\-repeal approach. 

 **4.3 Impact: Post\-Repeal** 

 Beneficiaries of repeal include football fans, Irish and other ethnic/cultural minority groups, and Police Scotland. Jeanette Findlay, Convenor of **Fans Against Criminalisation** testified: 

 *“His contribution was extremely important in terms of providing a credible and convincing evidence base which clearly impressed the Committee Members. This is the first \(and only\) piece of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament itself to have ever been repealed. In our view Dr Webster's expertise lent academic weight to the campaign and played a significant part in the repeal of the Act.”* \[E5\] 

 Similarly, Danny Boyle, Parliamentary and Policy Officer of **BEMIS Scotland** \(the national umbrella body supporting the ethnic minorities voluntary sector in Scotland\), testified: 

 *“The comprehensive analysis of Dr. Webster's work evident in his verbal submission \[on the OBFA Repeal Bill\]… helped provide a necessary richer understanding of where socio\-cultural indicators that help define individuals and communities play a positive role in broader societal and intra community relations. BEMIS have found that the rush to use the criminal law… \[suppresses\] significant dynamics of community identity in a Scottish/British/ Irish context. As outlined by Dr. Webster at the justice ctte and on STV News these cultural indicators form intrinsic characteristics of individual and community identities... It is on \[the\] basis of mutual respect… that we can make progress in understanding why people think and act the way they do. This can only take place in a meaningful way beyond the realm of criminal law. \[…\] Webster’s analysis and research helped progress this line of inquiry.”* \[E5\] 

 An **‘Independent Review of Football Policing in Scotland’** \[E8\] commissioned by **Police Scotland** stated repeal had helpfully refocused policing on violent offending \(as opposed to surveilling verbal and symbolic sectarianism\), since “ *the ‘noise’ relating to the* \[ *OBFA*\] *legislation… led to the focus on football violence being diluted”*. As well as assisting *Police Scotland* in better addressing violent football disorder, repeal of the *OBFA* helped safeguard the life\-chances of ‘at risk’ football fans. Such fans were encouraged to plead guilty under the *OBFA*, even for low\-level offences \(e.g. swearing at police\), and even if they contested the charge and had no previous convictions. The result was a criminal record as a ‘sectarian’ offender – a major impediment to obtaining employment \[E9\]. Now, with *OBFA*\-type offences prosecuted under less stigmatised breach of the peace law, marginalised youth from deprived communities no longer face disproportionate policing measures which harm their life\-chances. 

 Webster’s engagement with the Scottish Government has also led to wider impact beyond the repeal of the *OBFA*. James Kelly MSP submitted a response to the **Lord Bracadale Hate Crime Review**, which on three occasions referred to Webster’s evidence \[E10\], which was thereby included in the consultation. In this policy context, Webster’s research on religious hate \[R1 *passim*\] led to an 850\-word **Scotsman** op\-ed \(20/10/18\) \[E11\]. This piece commented on a Scottish Government anti\-hate campaign, itself reported as a hate crime by a prominent Christian minister who accused it of labelling all preachers ‘bigots’. 

 This aspect of Webster’s research \[R1 Chapter 3\] also led him to be a major contributor to public debate about freedom of expression regarding a proposed ban on loyalist/republican marches following a sectarian riot in Govan in 2019. After the riot, Glasgow City Council took the unprecedented step of banning five loyalist/republican marches, with the **SNP Administration** supporting a permanent ban. Webster was contacted by the **Times** to write a 500\-word article \(page 2\) explaining why his research \[R1 Chapters 2, 4, and Conclusion\] recommended against a ban \(02/9/19\) \[E11\]. 

 This prompted a 340\-word article in the **Sun** titled “‘PROBLEMATIC’ Scots loyalist and republican march bans would ‘accelerate bigotry and erode human rights’” \(02/9/19\) \[E11\]. As a result, on the following day the **Times** published a 400\-word ‘Thunderer’ op\-ed authored by Webster, titled “Banning sectarian parades would only deepen the hatred” \(03/9/19\) \[E11\]. Following the banning of five marches after the Govan riot, Webster appeared live on STV’s \(ITV\) premier news programme **Scotland Tonight** \(12/9/19\) in their lead story to debate the ban with former Glasgow Lord Provost Michael Kelly. The debate between Webster \(against the ban\) and Kelly \(for the ban\) lasted for half the 14\-minute segment \[E11\]. Two weeks after Webster argued that the ban unjustifiably curbed free speech, Glasgow City Council publicly conceded that there was “no legal basis” for their actions and ceased its ban. 

 Following sectarian attacks on Glasgow’s statue of William III during **Black Lives Matter** protests, the **Times** published a 400\-word op\-ed by Webster, titled “Statues are worth both defending and vandalising” \[based on R1\] and a 600\-word profile of his book \[R1\] \(18/6/2020\) \[E12\]. This led to a 250\-word **Irish News** profile on Webster’s book, and commentary in the **Scotsman \[E12\] *.  Marc Horne, senior reporter at the **Times** testified: 

 *“Dr Webster's extensive and immersive research has provided a fresh and timely insight into… religion, politics and sectarianism in urban Scotland. His work has shone a light into a corner of society that has often been overlooked and misrepresented by opinion formers. His work, which has been published in The Times, has provoked debate and challenged preconceptions at a time when the politics of identity are dominating global headlines”* \[E5\] *.* 

 So prominent is Webster’s research on sectarianism that it is now a case study to be taught in FE colleges in Scotland as part of a **Scottish Qualifications Authority** module in Anthropology titled ‘Ethnographies of People in Scotland’. Richard Irvine \[E5\], of SQA, stated: 

 *“The work of Dr Webster, and in particular his testimony on the \[OBFA\], has been of tremendous value in communicating the importance of the contemporary Anthropology of Scotland. Students at FE colleges are enthused by material that they can connect with social life in Scotland right now, and it is particularly valuable for them to see the potential policy implications of ethnographic research. I am grateful to Dr Webster for his participation \[which\] really brings the social sciences to life for young people in Scotland.”* 

 Since repeal, Webster has influenced wider debate about hate crime, with the **Independent Review of Hate Crime Legislation** Final Report** advising against statutory replacement for Section 1 of the *OBFA* \[E10\], as per his Justice Committee testimony and media commentary. 

 Webster’s research on sectarianism in Scotland has been instrumental in bringing about important legislative change. Not only has repeal of the OBFA improved the life chances of young ‘at risk’ football fans \(many of whom are from already deprived communities\), but it has assisted the police in more effectively tackling violent football disorder. Webster’s research has shaped a much broader debate about the nature of sectarianism and hate crime. His research has influenced current and future anti\-sectarianism policy in Scotland by engaging with politicians, journalists, campaigners, and FE colleges to redefine sectarianism not as a juridical problem, but as a social problem which requires a societal solution. As the Scottish Government currently debates new ways to tackle hate crime, Webster’s research continues to influence draft legislation by assisting politicians to learn from the mistakes of the OBFA.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Stirling’s research has underpinned the realisation of children’s participation rights for all children in Scotland and shaped participation strategies globally. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child \(UNCRC\) guarantees children’s participation rights, however, actualization is often tokenistic, with limited consultation with select young people only. Our research showed such rights are better realised by supporting meaningful dialogue between adults and children. 

 Because our research is now embedded into policies, guidelines, toolkits, and professional training, children in Scotland now work in partnership with parents and teachers in evaluation, quality assurance and monitoring of educational provision, and evidence of intergenerational dialogues is now sought during Scottish education settings inspections. Internationally, World Vision and several European Union nations have used our research to inform participation strategies, helping to make the goals of the UNCRC a reality for many.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Introduction** 

 In March 2021, the UNCRC \(Incorporation\) \(Scotland\)  [Bill](https://beta.parliament.scot/bills/united-nations-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child-incorporation-scotland-bill) was passed, which will fully incorporate the UNCRC into law in Scotland. Our research \( **R1\-6**\) advances the translation of the UNCRC into practice, enabling the realization of children’s rights. Through our research, rights\-based participation is now better recognised and supported in the form of on\-going intergenerational dialogue, particularly in educational contexts. 

 Previous research on rights\-based participation in education has tended to focus on the formal work of pupil councils and ‘listening to children’s voices’. In general, pupil councils were shown to function tokenistically sometimes only involving more vocal, able, or middle\-class pupils. Similarly, through failing to inclusively involve the young or act on decisions, and through addressing issues of low importance or failing to report back, pupil councils often struggled to realise young people’s right to participate. Our research has reoriented this field, showing that worthwhile participation is firstly, more than eliciting views and is better understood as an on\-going, inclusive, intergenerational dialogue between young people and adults. Secondly, we showed that participation occurs in many informal ways, both in and outside of pupil councils. Thirdly, our research in schools uncovered how child\-adult dialogue across four identified arenas of participation \(see fig 1\) can lead to improved achievement and attainment, better professional conduct, and improved school culture. Through our rights\-based research involving young people and statutory bodies, we have directly embedded these findings and understandings into policy \( **R2**\) and guidance \( **R4**\). Overall, the research has repositioned young people’s participation, ensuring it is better recognised and supported as a necessary and on\-going intergenerational dialogue occurring in diverse settings. 

 **Research Contributions** 

 Seminal theoretical educational research \(for example, **R6**, **R5**\) shifted the focus from a concern with ‘listening to’ and ‘consulting’ young people \(for example, in school councils\) towards a view of the importance of shared decision making and dialogue with young people. In tandem, our empirical research \( **R3**\) distinctively explored young people’s lived experiences of participation in school demonstrating clear impacts on achievement and attainment. Funded by the Children and Young People’s Commissioner Scotland \(CYPCS; GBP6,360\), we researched participation in schools with deprived catchment areas where achievement and attainment was above average. We showed young people valued decision making in four setting types which we theorized and defined as ‘Arenas of Participation’ \(fig 1\). These were: in the formal curriculum \(for example, in class\), in the wider curriculum \(for example, in clubs and societies\), in many kinds of decision\-making or governance groups \(for example, EcoSchool committees\), and in community linking \(for example, guest speakers\). Evidence indicated participation was needed in all arenas for a positive school ethos and achievement and attainment. In **R1**, we summarise the analysis and the theorization of the arena\-based approach from which we derived the heuristic \(fig 1\) now central to guidance in Scotland \( **S6**\). 



 **Contributions to Policy and Professional Guidance** 

 Funded again by CYPCS \(GBP21,968\) – whose statutory duty is to promote children’s rights – in **R2**, we gathered evidence from expert informants to derive the current national standards on children’s participation. CYPCS uses our research \( **R2**\) as its framework to clearly call on professionals to address young people’s participation as an intergenerational dialogue across all children’s services. 

 In **R4**, Education Scotland \(the curriculum making body\) funded \(GBP21,364\) impact\-oriented research where findings from **R1** were used as the basis for new guidance for practitioners in all educational settings. In a pilot study, researchers collaborated with schools, teachers, and young people to co\-produce and trial the new support materials and these are now published on the ‘National Improvement Hub’ \( **S6**\). This partnership approach means there is now a new, evidence\-based, definition of ‘learner participation’ as intergenerational dialogue, as well as self\-evaluation tools, and practitioner videos. Stirling’s research\-informed resources now provide practical advice on how to embed effective participation into educational practice. 

 **Summary** 

 Across the theoretical, empirical and impact\-oriented research \( **R1\-6**\), our contributions have problematised the previous focus on listening to children’s voices, and inaugurated a more dialogical, and contextualised framing in theory, empirical research, policy and guidance. This new approach is shown through our evaluative and applied research to have impacts on achievement and attainment outcomes for young people, professional practice, staff\-pupil relations, and school\-community linking.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research has supported services to change as Scotland incorporates the UNCRC into law. In support of this change, the research has directly impacted on policies, guidance, and training for professionals leading to improved service provision and educational outcomes for young people in Scotland and internationally. These impacts reach across all children’s services in Scotland \(in childcare, in 5,000 schools \- 180,000 pupils\), and greater numbers internationally. Inspections, testimonials, pilot studies, and independent evaluation all confirm conceptual impacts on policy, societal impacts on professional practice, and on outcomes for children’s lives especially in educational settings. Pathways to impact included validation and engagement events \(for example, **S8**\) for adults and young people, direct advice to Government via the ‘Children’s Participation Strategic Research Group’ and the ‘Empowered Education System’ initiative \( **S5**\). 

####  Impacts on Policy and Practice 

 **R1**, **2**, **3**, **4** & **9** directly informed new key resources in the Scottish Government’s national children’s participation website *Decision\-making: children and young people's participation* \( **S10**\). Our definition of participation \(from **R4**\) is re\-adopted there and **S1** and **R4** are cited as key resources. Dr Mannion’s invited advice in the formation of the government website \( **S10**\) has ensured new emphasis on intergenerational dialogue and “improved child\-adult relations”. 

 **R2** impacted the work of the *Children and Young People’s Commissioner Scotland* \(CYPCS\) shifting policy towards intergenerational and dialogical approaches: 

 “This research catalysed a step\-change in policy for us, providing evidence to inform how we promoted a distinctively intergenerational approach to rights\-based practice. The research, for example, informed the 7 Golden Rules which have been taken up and used widely.” \(Ms Cathy Begley, Participation and Education Officer, CYPCS\) \( **S1b**\) 

 CYPCS’s *7 Golden Rules of Participation* \(in multiple languages, downloaded 2,000 to 3,000 times annually from 2014 onwards, and also available as a hard copy\) were derived from **R2**. For example, ‘Rule 6’ is that adults and children should ‘Work together’ and participation should not be ‘once\-off’. Independent evaluation \( **S2**\) shows the resource is used extensively across Scotland, bringing adults and children into new dialogues advancing participation rights with considerable reach and impact: 

 \[It has\] “proven to be a popular method of opening up discussion on children’s participation and rights. \[…\] \[and has\] been effective in reaching sectors which were previously untouched. \[The Rules\] have motivated professionals.” \( **S2,** p 36\) 

 Many stakeholders have used **R2**, **R3** and **R4** as core sources for new resources, toolkits, and training. For example, Scottish Childminders \( **S3**\), Education Scotland, Care and Learning Alliance, and YouthLink Scotland, have all directly engaged with the new rights\-based approach, impacting thousands of professionals annually within and outside of formal education. 

####  Societal & Practice Impacts 

 In government policy, **R2**, **R3**, and **R4** have helped reposition young people as rights\-holders who work in partnership with parents and teachers in evaluation, quality assurance and monitoring of educational provision. **R3** informed a draft Government Bill \( **S5b**\), *Empowering Schools* which led to a new government initiative \( **S5a**\), ‘Empowering the System’, for which Dr Mannion provided consultancy. 

 **R4** is itself a direct policy impact. Here, our team, funded by Education Scotland, authored new children’s participation guidance for all professionals in education. We co\-designed learning resources, self\-evaluation tools, and practice videos published online \( **S6**\) \(with more than 14,000 page views since April 2018\). A government evaluation \( **S9**, p.42\) showed that **R4** has been a key mechanism in progressing child rights through adopting more dialogical approaches. 

 In the pilot study \( **S6**\) of the guidance and resources, teachers said it was improving rights\-based provision, school\-community links, child\-adult relations, and outcomes for children: 

 “Previously, we had just Pupil Council. After introducing the new arenas\-based approach, the pupils are now constantly coming with ideas. It’s giving the children a say. They are talking and reflecting on what they are learning a lot more”. \(Head Teacher, St John the Baptist\) \( **S6b**\) 

 Another teacher noted improvement in engagement in learning: 

 “Before we introduced the participatory approach across arenas \[R4\], pupils were somewhat disengaged and lacked motivation. Now, pupils are more enthusiastic showing independent ownership of learning. There is more parental involvement and more mutual respect.” \(Class teacher, Blackburn Primary\) \( **S6b**\) 

 **R3** and **R4** have reshaped self\-evaluation and improvement processes in education. In **S7**, *How Good is* OUR *School*, Education Scotland drew on **R4** to require involvement of young people in school improvement processes. As a result, education settings are, for the first time, inspected for evidence of ‘intergenerational dialogues’ across all arenas of school life \(fig 1\). Visiting 45 schools, HM Inspectorate noted there was “now a much broader range of approaches beyond the pupil council” including intergenerational projects \( **S7b** p.12\-14\). There are now regular training events for teachers using the research \( **S3b**\). 

####  International Impacts 

 Through our research, the concept of intergenerational dialogue and advocacy for rights\-based monitoring is also spreading in global children’s rights policy and practice. In the EU, the Directorate\-General for Justice and Consumers has identified **R2** and **R5** as highly significant in supporting the step change towards participation as an intergenerational dialogue \( **S4c**, section 4.5\); the report provides examples of intergenerational meetings and dialogues in Croatia, Greece, the Netherlands, and Malta. The research is cited as informing rights\-based approaches in other countries too, such as Ireland \( **S4d**\). 

 World Vision, who improve the lives of millions of children across 70\+ countries predominantly in the Global South, cite **R6** as key in shaping their strategy \( **S4a**\), which “encourages intergenerational dialogue and promotes the notion that child and youth participation is everyone’s responsibility” \(p.21\). Evidence shows intergenerational dialogue has prevented hundreds of forced child marriages enabling children to attend school for longer. “Drawing on research by Dr Mannion, we now place intergenerational dialogue as a core value in World Vision. \(…\) In Niger, where 76% of girls are married before their 18th birthday, children now have rights\-based dialogues with significant adults about arranged marriages” \(Dr C. LeBorgne, World Vision, **S4b**\). 

 “For World Vision, Dr Mannion's research has been instrumental in implementing a dialogical intergenerational approach. Before, adults sometimes diminished children's activism and input, but through these improved dialogues, child rights are better realised bringing more mutual respect and collaboration between generations.” \(Director for Child Rights and Participation, World Vision, **S4b**\) 

 Stirling’s impactful research on intergenerational dialogue builds now on a successful feasibility study \( **S4e**\) in 2019 and follow\-on funding in 2020 from the Medical Research Council \(Stirling\-led, GBP730,000, Dr Mannion as co\-investigator\). Drawing on R1\-6, the intergenerational approach empowers young people to create powerful murals catalysing community\-based dialogue, local action, and the reduction of road deaths and injuries. Due to Covid\-19, that project is set to commence in 2021 extending the reach of the impacts across Malawi and sub\-Saharan Africa.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The WHO estimates that only 10% of those who need palliative care globally actually receive it.  King’s College London research has underpinned a global shift in how palliative care is considered, defined and delivered. The research has transformed access to person\-centred palliative care beyond its origins for advanced cancer in high income countries through \(i\) identification of underserved groups and inequalities; \(ii\) development of tools to measure and manage patients’ symptoms and concerns; \(iii\) development and testing of complex interventions to reconfigure care delivery. The research has helped realign regional, national and international policies to improve access to palliative care; improved access to care for ethnically diverse groups in the UK; transformed delivery of quality palliative care in Africa; reoriented Standards of Care for people living with HIV to include person\-centred and palliative care; improved identification of symptoms and concerns for people with dementia. Much of this impact has been underpinned by the development of the Palliative Outcome Scale \(POS\) family of measures: Since the early impact described in our 2014 Impact Case Study, this work has broadened and increased its reach through implementation across diverse diseases, global regions and underserved groups. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The World Health Organisation \(WHO\) identifies palliative care as an essential health service under Universal Health Coverage. For patients and families facing serious illness, palliative care improves outcomes such as distressing symptoms, and delivers care concordant with preferences such as enabling people to die at home. For health systems, palliative care is a high\-value low\-cost intervention. Historically palliative care was mainly available for people with cancer and those in high\-income countries. King’s research has transformed access to palliative care for patients, families and health systems regardless of diagnosis or geographical location, in three steps: 

 **1. Identification of underserved groups and inequities at a population level.** Having identified a knowledge gap about palliative care for conditions other than cancer, King’s research revealed a high symptom burden for people living and dying with diverse conditions, including dementia, HIV and neurological conditions, and showed that global palliative care needs will escalate over the next decades, especially in low\- and middle\-income countries **\(1\)**. We found that people living with HIV nationally and internationally commonly experience high symptom burden and poor clinical outcomes, especially anxiety and pain. We identified the information and communication preferences of people living with HIV in the UK and Africa, and the lack of coverage of palliative care services **\(2\)**. This led to research on palliative care needs for people with TB **\(3\)**. For people with long\-term neurological conditions \(such as motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis \(MS\) and Parkinson’s disease\) King’s research identified the palliative care needs of patients and families. We found that multiple, burdensome symptoms are highly prevalent in these groups, that patients and families experience multiple losses, and that care is poorly coordinated. King’s research identified widespread and consistent disparities in relation to the receipt of end of life care among Black, Asian and ethnically diverse \(BAED\) groups, impacting on patient experience and outcomes such as fulfilling preferences for place of care and death **\(4\).** 

 **2. Measuring and managing symptom burden and concerns across physical, psychosocial and spiritual domains.** This research was underpinned by development and implementation of the King’s\-led Palliative Outcome Scale \(POS\) series of measures. The original validated POS, \(included in REF2014\) was a 10\-item measure of physical, emotional, social and spiritual concerns affecting patients living and dying with serious illness and their families. We validated a self\-report version for patients with limited literacy in sub\-Saharan Africa, and an observational version for staff to use when patients are too ill to self\-report. Since 2013, the POS has been culturally adapted and validated in different languages and underserved disease groups \(e.g. HIV, renal disease, myeloma, heart failure, dementia, multiple sclerosis, and drug\-susceptible and resistant TB\). In 2017, the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale \(IPOS\) brought together the best features from earlier versions **\(5\)**. 

 **3. Developing and testing complex interventions to reconfigure care delivery and improve outcomes**. POS formed the basis for several complex interventions to improve care and patient wellbeing. King’s developed and tested, in a randomised controlled trial, a novel approach to integrate palliative care for people living with HIV in Africa which improved patient\-reported outcomes **\(6\)**. Our further randomised controlled trial found integration of palliative care into neurology to be cost effective \(the first cost effectiveness trial in palliative care\) **\(7\)**. For people with dementia, our research found integration of IPOS for Dementia \(IPOS\-Dem\) in routine clinical care improved detection of symptoms and concerns, facilitated communication of care between care staff, family and health professionals, and supported care planning **\(8\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **King’s research has been a major contributor to a global shift in how palliative care is considered, defined and delivered.** Our academics were part of a Global Consensus Statement \(2019\) that redefined palliative care using our research on global projections of palliative care need, ensuring it is provided according to individual needs, with reducing suffering as the main goal of care, across high\- middle\- and low\-income countries **\[A\]**. Our research on global projections and palliative care for people living with HIV in low\- and middle\-income countries informed the 2020 World Health Organisation \(WHO\) Global Atlas of Palliative Care which drives the global effort to improve and monitor access **\[A2\].** All United Nations member states are, since 2012, required to provide palliative care under the WHO’s Universal Health Coverage goals; King’s research has delivered tools and interventions to help implementation and drive change. 

#  King’s research helped transform regional, national, and international policies to improve access to palliative care. 

 **1. Regional policy impact – end of life care as a priority for London.** King’s research played a key role in the decision to include End of Life Care as one of ten priority areas in the 2019 Our Vision for London, a pan\-London partnership bringing together the Greater London Authority, Public Health England \(PHE\), London Councils and the National Health Service \(NHS\) in London **\[B1\]**. The Vision seeks to improve health and care outcomes for the 8,900,000 people living across London. It includes a commitment that all Londoners in their last year of life have access to personalised care planning and support that enables them to die in their preferred place. The Clinical Director for End of Life Care, NHSE/I \(London region\) said: “I am certain that Dr Koffman and the \[King’s\] CSI team’s research evidence played a key role in engaging the London Assembly and ultimately the decision to include End of Life Care as a priority area” **\[B2, B3\]**. 

 **2. National policy impact – inclusion of King’s research in NICE guidelines **.** King’s RCT of palliative care for people with MS was the first cost\-effectiveness trial of a palliative care service in the world, and found palliative care to be cost effective. This evidence was used in NICE guidelines \(NG27, 2015\) to recommend that inpatient hospital settings should establish multi\-disciplinary palliative care teams, in addition to ensuring that people needing end\-of\-life care are offered both general and specialist palliative care services, according to their needs **\[C1,2\]**. It also informed NICE guidelines \(NG94, 2018\), recommending the option of specialist multidisciplinary community\-based palliative care for patients in the terminal phase of illness **\[C3,4\]**. Finally, King’s data underpinned PHE’s 2017 tool for cost\-effective palliative care commissioning **\[C5,6\]**. 

 **3. International policy impact – inclusion of King’s research by World Health Organisation.  King’s research on palliative care for people with multi\-drug resistant tuberculosis was used by the WHO to make recommendations on access to palliative and end of life care for all patients with multidrug resistant TB in their End TB Strategy \(2014\). This was the first time the strategy promoted access to palliative and end of life care for all patients with multidrug resistant \(MDR\) TB **\[D1\]**. King’s research informed the associated toolkit **\[D2\]** and ethics guidance **\[D3\]** to assist programme managers, policymakers and healthcare staff ensure management of multidrug resistance is based on patient need rather than prognosis. It also informed the companion handbook **\[D4\]** for public health decision\-makers, programme managers and clinical staff. Additionally, the WHO technical report ‘Selection and Use of Essential Medicines’ \(2014\) used King’s research to highlight that palliative care medicines are needed in conditions other than cancer, namely MDR TB and HIV/AIDS **\[D5\]**. This report informs the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, used by at least 154 countries to guide national and institutional lists of essential medications, and the procurement and supply of medicines in the public sector. 

 **King’s research has improved how hospices in the voluntary sector provide palliative care to people from ethnically diverse communities across the UK.** Our work on inequality of access to palliative care by ethnically diverse groups led Marie Curie, a major end of life care charity, to commission King’s researchers to write a report on palliative and end of life care for Black, Asian and ethnically diverse \(BAED\) groups in the UK **\[E1\]**. Following its publication \(2013\), Marie Curie has used the report to launch activities focused on broadening access to palliative and hospice care, and increasing the involvement of service users from BAED communities. This has led to: improved recording of data on ethnicity in clinical services \(from 40\-60% to 95%\); introduced service user feedback to drive service improvements, focusing on access, quality of care and outcomes; better assessment and meeting the communication needs of all service users through the Accessible Communication Policy and regular accessible information audits **\[E2,E3\]**; led to a new three\-year Lottery funded project to develop an evidence base to improve access to services for people from BAED backgrounds **\[E4\]**; development of a staff learning resource to ensure staff can deliver the highest quality care to terminally ill people and their families and carers from BAED communities. The CEO of Marie Curie said: “The report has been highly influential, both to our internal discussions and our strategic planning for this as a priority area. The report provided robust evidence for problems we were aware of but unable to quantify and identified issues that had not been previously considered by us. These activities have had a direct impact on the quality of services that we offer to patients and families.” **\[E5\]**. 

 **King’s research has improved palliative care for people living in Africa.** Our work to develop, validate and implement the African POS \(APOS\) was carried out with African partners, drawing on POS with an additional focus on spiritual wellbeing and self\-report for people with low literacy. APOS has impacted health care staff and services \(enabling them to holistically assess and identify priorities for patients\), and patients/caregivers \(enabling them to communicate and get help for burdensome symptoms and concerns\). APOS is used by services across Africa: a survey in 2020 by the African Palliative Care Association \(APCA, a pan\-African non\-governmental organisation\) found 44 services in 9 African countries used APOS, all of whom reported a positive impact on care **\[F\]**. Use of APOS benefits patients by making the care processes more efficient and effective, by focusing on measurable outcomes. Staff from Makarere/Mulago Palliative Care Unit Uganda said: “It enabled staff to prioritise and treat the most distressing symptoms and to give the most appropriate interventions”. Survey respondents described how this happened. APOS helps open communication between health professionals and patients/carers, enabling the latter to ‘clearly articulate what their problems are’. Its use ‘brings families on board’ so that they feel ‘like part of the care giving team by being involved in every step of care planning’. Use of APOS has helped staff improve services; one African provider said “Using a research tool has shown us that we are making a difference in outcomes for patients. \(It has\) given us reason to continue to improve our service and recognize symptoms we are not doing well on” **\[F\]**. 

 **King’s research has strengthened palliative and person\-centred care for people living with HIV in the UK.** For people living with HIV, palliative care needs were previously poorly identified and managed. Since 2007, the British HIV Association \(BHIVA\) has led on production of the UK’s National Standards of Care for People Living with HIV \(PLWH\). The Standards, which are NICE\-approved national guidelines, are critically important to everyone living with HIV in the UK, ensuring joined\-up care. In 2018, as a result of King’s research, for the first time the updated Standards of Care included both person\-centred and palliative care **\[G1\].** To ensure meaningful person\-centred care, King’s research co\-developed and tested with patient groups a person\-centred outcome measure \(POSitive outcomes\), which is now included in the Standards of Care as a measurable and auditable outcome, with a target that 90% patients complete it. The Standards of Care also include IPOS to identify palliative care needs among people living with HIV. A patient advocate who works with i\-Base and UKCAB \(NGOs that advocate for and support people living with HIV\) said: “The research…identified the things that affect the wellbeing of people living with HIV such as pain and other symptoms, and concerns such as housing, poverty, and stigma….This will help bring changes to clinical practice that can benefit all PLWH regardless of ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, or age” **\[G2\]**. 

 King’s work also led to the inclusion, since 2015, of palliative care in the national audit of HIV deaths run by PHE. While initially focused on the 38,600 people living with HIV in London, since November 2019 this has expanded to a National audit to receive data on the 97,650 people living with HIV in the UK. The co\-lead for HIV surveillance at PHE said: “This has enabled us to … better care for those approaching death” **\[G3\]**. 

 **King’s research has improved the assessment of symptoms and needs in people with dementia.** IPOS\-Dem was developed by King’s from IPOS to incorporate the common symptoms and concerns of older people with multi\-morbidities and dementia. IPOS\-Dem was developed to be completed by care staff without formal clinical training using acessible language. It underwent cognitive testing to ensure that it is quick to complete, acceptable to care staff, and easy to understand and use. IPOS\-Dem addresses an important gap in the comprehensive assessment of symptoms and concerns important to people living with dementia. IPOS\-Dem empowers clinical staff to meet the palliative care needs of people with dementia, and monitor response to management strategies. An audit of 11 UK services where IPOS\-Dem is used found IPOS\-Dem facilitated patient\-centred care by increasing awareness of previously unknown problems, and through involving patients and families. It demonstrated the feasibility and benefit of using outcome measures in routine care to support assessment and management **\[H1\]**. The Dementia Lead Nurse at Trinity Hospice “Using IPOS‐Dem enables an easier and more structured identification of symptoms and problems among people with dementia” **\[H2\]**. Since its publication in 2017, teams in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Japan and Sweden are translating and validating its use in routine care across care settings e.g. care homes, hospitals **\[H\]**. 

 **Ongoing development of the POS family of measures has had a global reach and impact.** Since the REF2014 case study that described the development of POS and its early impact, this work has broadened and increased its reach across diverse disease groups and global regions. An important mechanism to ensure the global impact of POS has been the POS website \(www.pos\-pal.org\), which provides free downloadable versions of the POS, guidance on its use and links to related publications. The website has 14,871 registered users \(increased from 1,274 in 2014 REF case study\), from 150 countries \(increased from 74 in 2014\) **\[I1\]**. In the UK, IPOS is recommended as part of the Palliative Care Clinical Dataset **\[I2\]**. The renal version of POS \(POS\-S\-Renal\) was used to develop a national programme supported by NHS England and the UK Renal Registry to empower patients to take greater control of their health and wellbeing **\[I3,4\].** IPOS and IPOS\-Dem are incorporated into standards of care internationally **\[I5,6\]**. 

 **Rapid identification of symptom control needs and management of people with COVID\-19.** Early in the COVID\-19 pandemic it became clear that while palliative care was essential to the Covid response, it was missing from national and international guidelines. Our rapid research provided the first evidence of palliative care needs and response to treatment among people dying with COVID\-19, as well as recommendations for the response of palliative care and hospice services to the pandemic. We led a collaboration with the European Lung Foundation to produce factsheets for patients admitted to hospital with COVID\-19, and their families **\[J1,2\]**. These have been translated into 27 languages and downloaded >13,000 times in English and >1,000 times in other languages by patients, family members and hospitals across the NHS and globally. Feedback from patients shows that this resource has improved communication with medical teams, allaying anxiety for patients and families. Health professionals have reflected they have been an invaluable resource to meet information needs in a rapidly changing and stressful situation: “Having something to give to patients in their language has been so helpful. They can then take their time reading this and come back to us if they have any questions” **\[J3\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Despite being the world’s second largest investor in science and technology, China’s scientific credibility suffers from a lack of transparency and public engagement. University of Kent research conducted by Zhang between 2014 and 2020 has: 

1.  Achieved a significant breakthrough in promoting national policy change on the transparency and public engagement of science in China. 

1.  Initiated cultural and curriculum change in the Life Sciences in China’s higher education sector. 

1.  Raised international awareness of China’s public engagement deficit and informed high\-level science funding and governance strategies in the UK and in continental Europe. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 China is now the world’s second\-largest investor in science and technology, and overtook the United States as the largest producer of scientific papers in 2018. Yet, cases such as the CRISPR\-baby scandal, in which a Chinese scientist applied illegal reproductive germ\-line editing to produce the birth of twin girls, was but one example of how China’s deficiency in anticipating, guiding, and responding to social concerns casts a shadow on the public attitude towards research carried out in, and with, China. A series of studies on China’s science governance between 2014 and 2020 led by Zhang have identified three key issues that have hindered China from becoming a trusted player in global science: 

 **Finding 1: ‘ **Post\-hoc** pragmatism’ and the negligence of public engagement** 

 Despite being a global scientific power, China’s public engagement \(PE\) programme is still at a nascent stage. This is a direct consequence of what Zhang identified as ‘ *post\-hoc* pragmatism’, which has been a central regulatory ethos in China’s science sector **\[R1\]**. The stronghold of pragmatism is exhibited in the fact that the primary aim of scientific research and research oversight has been to minimise public concerns and disputes – delivering technological fixes to social problems without ‘unnecessarily’ opening up or engaging with public discussion. Unless there is concrete evidence of wrongdoing, Chinese regulators and the scientific community limit their interaction with the public. Consequently, Chinese bio\-governance is often *post hoc* in the sense of being reactive to international criticisms as opposed to being precautionary. Science communication and public outreach have never been included in research funding decisions, and have not been recognised as part of any science curriculum in Chinese higher education **\[R1\]**. 

 **Finding 2: The ‘credibility paradox’ in science communication and the need for capacity building** 

 Almost all of the scientists Zhang interviewed explicitly acknowledged the importance of PE, but they also pointed out a ‘credibility paradox’, which significantly discouraged their participation **\[R3\]**. That is, scientists felt that contributing to formal channels of public outreach often incurred more public scepticism and contention, as institutional\-led communication was often perceived as propaganda. Conversely, scientists without visible institutional and official endorsements seemed to receive more public credibility. This highlights that for China to develop effective science communication that matches its research capacities, institutional cultural change and communicative capacity\-building among scientific practitioners are needed **\[R4\]**. 

 **Finding 3: The need to p<ins>romote social embeddedness of new biotechnologies</ins> in and with China** 

 Through the pilot launch of the Educational Module Resource on PE in leading Chinese universities **\[R4, R5\]**, and through a series of workshops between the British and Chinese life scientists, ethicists, and regulators in 2017, 2018, and 2019 **\[R6\]**, Zhang found that, despite increasing transnational collaborations between China and the UK, hitherto there had been no real attempt to develop PE in a transnational manner. This significantly constrains the capacity for both countries <ins>to work with intermediaries across different cultural\-political contexts and share good practice for better social embeddedness of new biotechnologies.</ins>

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **1\) Promoting national policy change on the transparency and public engagement of science in China** 

 On 3 January 2019, China’s Ministry of Science and Technology officially accepted a set of five policy recommendations that were lead\-authored by Zhang \(a British citizen\) as their ‘ *Neican*’ **\[a\]**. *Neican* refers to valued official policy submissions that are put forward to high\-level government officials, this being ‘a critical channel for the making and revision of politics and other regulatory changes’ in China **\[b\]**. The details of the five policy recommendations are as follows \(each recommendation’s connection to Zhang’s underpinning research is noted in parentheses\): 

1.  Building ethics and public engagement teaching into the curriculum of undergraduate and postgraduate science and technology degrees \(corresponding to underpinning research Findings 1, 2\). 

1.  Incorporating public engagement into research funding decisions and project management \(Finding 2\). 

1.  Improving research and responsiveness to public attitudes towards science \(Finding 1\). 

1.  Capacity\-building through interdisciplinary and international exchanges \(Finding 3\). 

1.  A more proactive approach in joining international ethical governance discussions \(Findings 1, 3\). 

 Given the closed nature of Chinese politics, for social research to be featured in *Neican* is highly uncommon, even for academic projects funded by China. To accept *Neican* from a British sociologist and based on a UK\-funded project is exceptional. 

 Given that the writing of this *Neican* spanned over 15 months, and that it was ‘reviewed and commented on by officials at various levels at the ministry’, the process itself ‘has instrumentally brought forward serious deliberations on improving public engagement of science’ **\[b\]**. For example, the national curriculum changes proposed in the *Neican* have already been followed by coordinated institutional actions. In March 2019, China’s Research Institute for Science Popularization \(CRISP\), a science media centre with direct Government backing, decided to systematically introduce textbooks on science communication, with Zhang as an external expert **\[c\]**. Given CRISP’s unique nationwide platform, when this textbook series is released in the next two years, it is expected to reach an audience of more than four million **\[c\]**. 

 In sum, as a direct result of Zhang’s research, a set of nationwide policy recommendations have been accepted through a highly significant official channel, and this has already led to material changes in science education in the most populated country in the world. 

 **2\) Ongoing science curriculum change in Chinese higher education** 

 To assist Chinese universities in incorporating PE into their curriculums, Zhang developed a pilot Educational Module Resource \(EMR\) on PE with detailed teaching instructions in 2017. This set of seven lectures are freely available online, and combine both international experience and Chinese case studies to support scientific practitioners and educators to learn about PE skills and how best to utilise existing communicative platforms **\[R5\]**. 

 As of March 2020, the EMR has been fully or partially adopted into the teaching of at least six Chinese higher education institutions, with an annual reach of more than 1,000 science students **\[d, e\]**. This includes two institutes at the Chinese Academy of Sciences \(Institute for Microbiology and the Institute for the History of Natural Sciences\); Tsinghua University; Communication University of China; Yantai University; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; and Beijing Institute of Technology. The EMR was designed not simply to impart ‘factual’ knowledge on international experience, but to set up a model on ‘how to inspire and sustain discussions’ within the Chinese context **\[e\]**. Students and instructors have described the EMR as an ‘eye opener’ on how PE can be effectively delivered in China, a country with a limited tradition of public debate **\[d\]**. 

 The ‘demonstrative effect’ **\[d\]** of the successful experimentation with the EMR has further convinced CRISP’s aforementioned investment in ‘systematically introducing teaching materials and channeling educational changes in China’ **\[c\]**. 

 **3. Raising international awareness of China’s public\-engagement deficit and informing high\-level science funding and governance strategies in the UK and in continental Europe** 

 In 2018 and 2019, Zhang’s research has been cited at length in *Nature*’ *s* annual special review on China **\[R2, f\]**. In addition, Zhang <ins>was one of the 50 delegates worldwide invited to present at</ins> the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, the most significant global meeting on the future of gene research governance **\[g\]**. She also spoke at the 13th Berlin Debate on Science and Science Policy, an annual non\-public forum that aimed for open and critical debate with a small number of high\-ranking German and international decision\-makers in science such as the President of the European Research Council and *Nature*’ *s* Editor\-in\-Chief **\[h\]**. In particular, China is the UK’s key strategic partner in science. Since 2018, Zhang has been invited to share her research findings with the Royal Society’s Foreign Secretary, the Executive Director and the Science Policy Expert Advisory Committee. Her inputs ‘have all been materially helpful in informing the Society’s strategic approach to China’ **\[i\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 New diagnostic methods developed at Leeds \[1\] are being used by the Met Office \[A,B,C\] to exploit crowd\-sourced data \[D\] and to provide forecasters with maps showing, at unprecedentedly high resolution, the UK surface\-weather conditions. The products feed directly into Met Office forecasts and alerts of extreme events \[A,B,C\]. One example \[B\] shows how a successful flood alert would not have been possible without these products. 

 Exploiting the observational work \[1\], we devised a predictor of tornado probability \[1,2\]. Clark, who is employed as a scientist at the Met Office and registered as a part\-time PhD student supervised by Parker, has shared the methods with Met Office senior forecasters through research\-to\-operations seminars. The methods enabled forecasters to estimate the probabilities of UK tornadoes on a case\-by\-case basis \[C\], increasing confidence in the alerts they have provided to the public. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research developed in Leeds used novel observational analysis techniques \[1\] to explain the atmospheric conditions that are conducive to the development of tornadoes on intense UK cold fronts \[1,2\]. 

 The innovative methodology in \[1\] was the application and automation \-\- for the first time in the UK and, to the best of our knowledge, internationally \-\- of a real\-time bias\-corrected analysis technique for observations from a dispersed network of surface\-weather data. The research was able to evaluate the limits of the possible analysis, in particular demonstrating \(for the first time\) the extent to which fine structures and derivatives of fields, including calculation of convergence and vertical vorticity fields, could usefully be made \[1,α,D\]. The data analysis takes observations on a spatial network of weather stations separated by, on average, 5\-20 kilometres \(typically with higher resolution where it is most needed, in highly\-populated areas\), and interpolates them onto a 5 km grid for the whole of the UK. The research in \[1,α,D\] demonstrated that boundaries such as fronts or shear lines, and the associated vorticity and convergence, could be resolved accurately in the gridded fields on these 5 km scales. For comparison, prior methods gave forecasters only the maps of raw station data, at resolutions of around 30km; the fronts and shear lines had to be drawn on charts by hand; and, derived quantities like vorticity and divergence were not available to the forecasters at all from surface observations. 

 The research \[1,2\] identified, for the first time, the atmospheric fluid\-dynamical conditions causing cold\-frontal tornadoes. Tornadoes occur preferentially in conditions of strong post\-frontal winds oriented at a high angle relative to the front \[1\]. The high\-resolution observations demonstrate that the development of pre\-tornadic vortices is consistent with theoretical fluid\-dynamical models, giving confidence that the results are robust and enabling forecasters to have good conceptual understanding of a weather situation \(so\-called “situational awareness”\). 

 In subsequent research \[2\] we significantly improved the analysis of conditions favourable for tornadoes on UK cold fronts, increasing the sample of cases from 15 to 114. A quantitative tornado probability, p\(TN\), has been derived on the basis of two parameters: frontal shear vorticity and the normal component of post\-frontal winds. This represents a more quantitative version of the results in \[1\] from a bigger dataset and wider range of parameters. UK forecasters are testing and using the quantitative tornado probability diagnostic, and it has influenced forecasts \[C\]. 

 This research was initiated by a secondment of Clark from the Met Office to the University of Leeds in the period September\-November 2012, with the aim of gaining fundamental scientific understanding of atmospheric dynamics associated with UK windstorms. The resulting paper \[1\] included, for the first time in the UK, gridded surface fields from the surface data; the paper was effectively a pilot study demonstrating that it is possible to obtain useful parameters by sophisticated analysis of data from a network of sites. Clark subsequently registered for a part\-time PhD at the University of Leeds, during which time he extended the analysis to include data from the crowd\-sourced Weather Observation Website \(WOW\) \[α,D\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 New automated data analysis based on our methods \[1\] is yielding maps of prevailing UK surface\-weather conditions, which are used by UK forecasters on a daily basis to predict high\-impact weather \[A\]. Clark extended \[α,D\] the published methods \[1\] to develop an automatic analysis of Weather Observation Website \(WOW\) data \(i.e. “crowd\-sourced” home\-based automatic weather stations\) plus a subset of the official Met Office surface station data \(\~80 stations that report back to HQ in real time, out of a total of \~300 UK stations\). The approach significantly increases the effective spatial resolution of the maps that can be derived from official Met Office stations. Prior to this work, forecasters had access to only charts showing quantities observed Met Office station locations, on a spatial resolution of around 30 km. The new charts are mapped on a grid of 5 km resolution and we have shown \[1,α,D\] that they capture derived features of vorticity and convergence accurately. The increased resolution significantly increases the value of the weather forecasts provided to customers \(e.g. emergency responders\), because 5 km is the most “user\-relevant” scale, e.g. that of a town. 

 The products are maps of surface\-weather conditions, constructed from the bias\-corrected WOW data. The analyses are created every 10 minutes, about 12 minutes behind real time. They are one of a number of trial products \(the others being mainly radar\-based\) supplied to Met Office Ops Centre since early 2018, as part of the Nowcasting project \(led by Met Office Chief Meteorologist \[A\]\). The maps show forecasters the prevailing conditions of pressure, winds and temperatures, and derived fields including convergence and vorticity on the 5 km grid scale. In particular, the horizontal convergence from the gridded wind field helps forecasters pinpoint the most likely locations of convective storm initiation on days when impactful storms are anticipated. These products are now being used operationally by forecasters and have improved \[A,B\] their ability to provide successful \[B,D\] short\-term alerts of severe UK weather: the surface maps *“represent a step\-change in the level of information on surface conditions, and their spatial variability, available to the UK’s operational weather forecasters … the new maps are used on days when thunderstorms or other mesoscale severe weather phenomena are anticipated to help analyse the most likely locations for occurrence of high\-impact weather, including severe local winds, thunderstorms and flash floods.” \[A\].* 

 The automated generation of these products follows the methodologies developed in the research at Leeds \[1\]. Through his position in the Met Office, Clark was able to work with colleagues, including operational forecasters, to promote the new methods, and to integrate them into operational forecasting practice at the National Severe Weather Warning Service \(NSWWS\). 

 One example of the WOW analyses helping to inform the NSWWS decision\-making process occurred on 27 May 2018 \[B,D\]. “ *The development of severe convection was finely balanced with \[Numerical Weather Prediction\] NWP output showing the potential for convective release but tending away from realising severe developments. During that afternoon, the WOW analyses showed increasing thermal contrast and surface convergence across parts of the Midlands and this, combined with satellite imagery developments, aided in the decision to increase the likelihood of the warning – resulting in an AMBER weather warning being issued across the Birmingham area. This warning was then available on the Met Office website and app and was send directly to emergency responders in the affected areas. This highlighted the increasing likelihood of impacts from severe thunderstorms such as flooding and allowed emergency responders to stand up operations in preparation for rescue operations*” \[B\]. In the event, flash flooding occurred in Birmingham as predicted. 

 The use of the maps of surface weather conditions in research \[1\] has explained the conditions leading to UK cold\-frontal tornadoes \[1,2\]. “ *Previously, there has been no guidance available to UK meteorologists, as to whether a tornado may form on a given cold\-front, … on the basis of your research with Matt Clark, we now have a quantitative predictor of tornado probability, backed up by evidence and physical understanding*” \[A\]. The predictive tools emerging from this work \[2\] are now also being used and tested by UK forecasters \[A,C\] to assess the likelihood of these tornadoes and to influence the forecasts and alerts which are issued. The probability of tornadoes, p\(TN\), has been computed and tested in two cases by the Chief Forecaster on duty, and used alongside other evidence to influence the Met Office internal forecast\-discussion and daily briefing, the outcome of which is the daily written brief to all forecasters \[A\]. The information increases the “situational awareness” of forecasters, alerting them to the possibility of tornadoes and enabling them to respond to the changing situation. “ *By explaining, for the first time, ‘how’ and ‘why’ tornadoes form in a given weather system, meteorologists are much better prepared to anticipate events in advance, to interpret and challenge the results of numerical weather prediction models, and to communicate their confidence in a given forecast*” \[A\]. For example, the genesis of tornadoes is explained in \[1,2\] in terms of wind patterns recognised by the forecaster, and in terms of fluid\-dynamical mechanisms understood by a forecaster, such as horizontal shear instability. 

 In one event of 10<sup>th</sup> December 2019, this information was used to influence the judgement of forecasters \[C\] of the prevailing elevated tornado risk, one day in advance of the event. The Chief Forecaster was able to use the results of the research \[2\] to calculate a tornado probability of p\(TN\) \~ 0.5, and this was supported by other measures developed for US tornadoes. This knowledge increased the forecasters’ situational awareness, prompting them to consider the tornado risk in greater detail and, as a result, the “internal guidance” circulated among Met Office forecasters on 9<sup>th</sup> December 2019 noted the risk of high\-impact winds. In the event, a tornado did occur. 

 As a result of the research \[1,2\], Clark is regularly consulted by the Met Office forecast office to advise the forecasters directly when they anticipate a risk of UK tornadoes, for instance in winter cold\-front situations. Since 2018 Clark has advised Met Office forecasters \[A\] about 5\-10 times per year on the impending risks of tornadoes, usually through use of internal networking\-platforms within the Met Office. In this manner the research is increasing the wider capabilities of the staff in the Met Office: Clark, a Met Office scientist is using his experience developed in the research with Parker \[1,2\] and his PhD studentship at the University of Leeds, to advise and train the Met Office forecasters \[A\] on the impending risks of tornadoes.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Ballin gathered oral history testimony from former sanatorium patients. Patients described this as a positive experience even when painful memories were triggered. The process prompted fresh recollections of childhood hospitalisation. The research was shared on the Facebook page for former patients, which has 156 members. Information about the ‘Stories from Stannington’ event was viewed 101 times. 

 Impact was generated through Ballin’s research, presented as work in progress at Helix Arts \(15 attendees\). With Sue Wood \(Head Archivist\), Ballin presented *Stories from Stannington Sanatorium* at Northumberland Archives. The beneficiaries of the impact were more than 30 former patients, staff and their families, policy makers, oral historians, archive users, medical and historical tuberculosis researchers, local historians and the general public.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) See paragraphs 318 to 326. 

 **Research insights** 

 *Under an Artificial Sun* is funded through a Wellcome Trust Research Bursary and focuses on materials in the Stannington Children’s Sanatorium Collection at Northumberland Archives \(Ballin, 2018\). The research utilises creative methodologies \(oral history, audio, creative writing, film\) to investigate connections between archival material and contemporary childhood studies debates. It uncovers untold stories of the emotional legacy of childhood hospitalisation and examines how these may have shaped children’s lives in unexpected or undocumented ways. The medical benefits of long\-term hospitalisation due to tuberculosis are well documented. This research focuses on extending phenomenological understandings of these experiences including: parental separation, trauma, loneliness, boredom and resilience \(Ballin, 2019A\). 

 **An outline of the underpinning research:** 

 The research is situated within a cross disciplinary context and explores how arts practices can be utilised to  construct layered and complex stories, developing textured and nuanced understandings of the developmental impact of childhood hospitalisation; bring new perspectives to archival material and  encourage audiences to engage with this material in innovative ways. Research participants include: Northumberland Archives, former patients and staff of Stannington Sanatorium and a Senior Lecturer in Childhood Studies at Sheffield Hallam University. Other participants include, Helix Arts Digital Arts Network, families of former patients and oral historians, archive users, policymakers, arts organisations, local historians and medical and historical researchers of childhood tuberculosis \(Ballin, 2019A; 2019B; 2019C\). 

 *Under an Artificial Sun* builds on *Echoes of Protest* with Esther Johnson, \(Professor of Media Arts, Sheffield Hallam University\),which explored the legacy of being involved in significant protest movements from a child’s perspective & sought to understand the role protest can play in the lives of children and explore its aftermath. The first phase of the research; two exhibitions entitled, *A Share of a Pensioner’s Xmas ‘Bonus* at The People’s History Museum \(2015\- 2016\), Manchester and the National Coal Mining Museum for England, Wakefield \(2016\-2017\) used oral testimony and photography to highlight a seldom explored, perspective of the 1984\-1985 UK Miners’ Strike. 

 **Key contextual information about this area of research:** 

 Practice led research is a burgeoning area and is often incorporated into cross\-disciplinary research as a form of methodological innovation \(Barrett, 2010\). The art\-making process can operate as a valid alternative mode of enquiry to traditional scholarly research, transforming understanding and materializing different kinds of knowledge \(Sjoberg/Hughes, 2018\). From this standpoint ‘Under an Artificial Sun’ seeks to combine techniques from the social sciences with multiple arts\-based methodologies to generate new insights and perspectives into historic archive material. 

 Oral testimonies told from multiple perspectives can be used to articulate memories from both ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ the story. Spoken memory ‘is told from a multitude of ‘circumscribed points of view’ that are simultaneously ‘political and narrative’ \(Portelli, 1988\). Using oral history alongside multiple creative methodologies such as, film and audio can enable audiences to ‘gain an extended understanding of the emotional experience of history’ \(Ballin and Johnson, 2017\). Methodologies layering archive extracts, short story and oral testimony contrast ‘official’ institutional and medical accounts with remembered testimony and fictionalised voices, entwining fact and fiction and ‘creating a ‘discursive approach’ to documenting the past and exploring the ‘mutability of truth.’ \(Bruzzi, 2006\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 Ballin was invited by Helix Arts to present work in progress at \#Hadadi at Queens Hall Arts Centre, Hexham, 31 January 2019. The presentation attended by 15 artists and academics from the North East included a question and answer session with discussion of how creative methodologies can ‘open up archives’ documenting hidden or untold stories within them. **\[1\]** 

 Ballin gathered oral history testimony from former sanatorium patients who then evaluated their experience of being interviewed. Patients described this as a positive experience even when memories triggered were painful and discussed how the interviews prompted fresh memories of childhood hospitalisation. One former patient said, “ *Once I started answering the questions put to me, the past came flooding back*” and it was *“good to talk about things in the past”* **\[2\].** Another former patient, now in her 90s, said that being interviewed was a “ *good experience*” and *“brought back memories of Stannington and the children and staff at the hospital”* **\[3\].** 

 On 2<sup>nd</sup> July 2019, Ballin and Northumberland Archives’ Head Archivist presented the initial creative outputs at a public engagement event, *Stories from Stannington Sanatorium*, at Northumberland Archives, for former patients of Stannington, their families and the general public. The event was attended by more than 30 former patients, staff and their families, many of whom are now in their 80s and 90s, as well as policy makers, oral historians, archive users, medical and historical tuberculosis researchers, local historians and the general public. **\[4\]** 

 Ballin outlined her research and read extracts from her creative writing work *Under an Artificial Sun.* The event discussion encouraged former patients to share memories and prompted further recollections of childhood hospitalisation that were forgotten or supressed. The research provoked a debate about contradictions between staff recollections of the sanatorium and patient memories of trauma and institutional abuse. One former patient commented that at other events for former patients there was a tendency to look back with fondness or ‘rose\-tinted’ glasses which made them question their own difficult memories of the past. In a follow up email they said, *“I really have few memories of Stannington as I was told by my parents to forget the time I spent there and I buried them”.* Being interviewed, “ *brought back memories I had not thought about for 65 years or so. It then seemed unbelievable that I was ashamed for something I could not be guilty of*.” They stated that through the event discussion they “ *realised I was not alone*” and said that *“maybe if this had been done when we were much younger we might have lived life differently”* **\[5\].** 

 Head Archivist at Northumberland Archives said that *“arts projects often lead archivists to view their collections in different ways and to understand how collections can be used creatively … Archive users traditionally have tended to have a particular profile and arts projects widen audience participation often engaging with audiences that would never visit an archive service”* **\[6\].** 

 One oral historian, based at Newcastle University, stated that they *“believes that creative practitioners bring great value to oral historians’ efforts to communicate their findings to a wider audience.  Using oral history alongside other art forms is a striking way to create a more empathic relationship to the original material. The approach you have taken in ‘Stories from Stannington’ … is very interesting. By presenting your ‘evidence’ in the form of interview and sanatorium records extracts you are revealing the sources of your inspiration and demonstrating that your fiction represents something that could really have happened. It’s an intriguing and innovative endeavour, to juxtapose memories of an adult looking back with an imagined child’s point of view. Responding creatively to the richness of the Voices of Stannington Sanatorium interviews, and to the incredibly important archival collection is undeniably an effective method of communicating an historical ‘reality’”* **\[7\].** 

 The Cultural Development Manager for Northumberland Council, a policymaker, attended the event in order to further their understanding of how archives can work with artists to enhance public access to and understanding of archival material. They said, *“Artists bring people a different and new perspective on research. They can present it in a creative and accessible way. By utilising different artforms it can bring alive archival collections to new audiences”* **\[8\].** 

 Ballin was invited to join the Facebook site for former patients of Stannington Sanatorium in order to broaden the scope of the research and share it with a wider community of former patients and their families. The Facebook site has 156 members and 101 members viewed information about the ‘Stories from Stannington’ event. The completed poetic audio documentary will be shared on this site in Autumn 2020. **\[9\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 In the UK one person goes missing every two minutes on average. In 2019, 99% of 342,053 UK people reported in ‘missing incidents’ returned. Parr led award\-winning ESRC\-funded research gathering narratives of returned missing adults and their families. Findings changed *Approved Professional Practice on Missing Persons* \(England and Wales, 2016\) and *Standard Operating Procedures* \(Police Scotland, 2015\), improving police protocols relating to return and family liaison, and reaching *all* UK officers in England, Wales \(c.125,000\) and Scotland \(c.17,000\). Parr co\-developed training with the UK College of Policing ‘National Search Centre’ and evidence demonstrates improved empathetic police officer practice towards returning missing people and their families. Parr also used findings directly to shape government and voluntary sector changes, influencing UK charity and Scottish government policy priorities and guidance in this field, notably through the *National Framework for Missing People \(Scotland*\). 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 This case centres on improving a multi\-sector professional response to returned missing adults and their families in the UK, using findings from the ESRC\-funded *Geographies of Missing People* research project \(2011−2013\), and further mobilised by both University of Glasgow \(UofG\) ‘impact extension’ funding \(Jan\-July 2014\) and funds from an ESRC *Outstanding Impact on Society* Award \(2015\). The original research \(2011−2013\) was organised via co\-production processes and an academic\-community team \(Professor Nick Fyfe, University of Dundee; Dr Penny Woolnough, police researcher, Grampian Police\) and led by Parr \(PI, UofG\) with Stevenson \(RA\). Parr led the conceptualisation, design and delivery of the project, including the academic and public report writing for public engagement. We appointed a police and charity Advisory Group that enabled the co\-produced research design. 

 **Research findings:** The key research\-based conclusions of the ESRC project were that: **\(1\)** the social and spatial experiences of missing people and their families had previously been ignored in professional operational police practice and not used as learning resources; and **\(2\)** the complex needs of these groups were not being fully recognised or serviced by the police and charity sectors. These experiences and needs were recovered, analysed and represented in the project. The research highlighted how attending to the voiced experiences of returned missing people discloses their ‘lived geographies’: meaning how these people *use* spaces, places and environments when they go missing \(not just the distances that they travel, as captured by the ‘distance\-decay models’ commonly used in operational police practice: **References 3.3**, **3.1**\). While these insights enhance search techniques, the key finding is that the return of missing people is often poorly ‘handled’ by police officers, which represented a learning opportunity for improved good practice and new kinds of professional intervention that might prevent future incidence \( **3.1**, **3.3**, **3.4**\). Parr’s innovation was to gather voices of returned missing people into public ‘stories’ \( **3.4**\), and to use these stories to structure and inform the design of research reports containing a suite of closely related strategic recommendations. The experiences of families of missing people \( **3.5**, **3.2**\) were also analysed to reveal new understandings of their own search strategies and common relationship dynamics that occurred upon the return of a missing person. A further key finding was that police and families often work in parallel, sometimes unhelpfully, rather than in partnership \( **3.5**\). The research also showed that police *and* charity services were not doing enough in their professional roles to respond to the social complexities of a missing person’s return. The importance of the r *eturn* of missing people is hence *the* key finding from the research. 

  

 Since 2014 Parr has focussed on mobilising the project’s research findings about the return of missing people, strategically presented in three public research reports \( **3.6**\) and in academic writing \( **3.1**− **3.5**\) to generate: **\(1\)** recommendations for updated guidance issued to police officers regarding their professional practice in missing persons cases, specifically to encourage empathetic and in\-depth engagement with returned missing people, and with onward referral where necessary; **\(2\)** new training for police officers and other professionals directly involved with such cases; and **\(3\)** recommendations and education for a new UK\-wide multi\-sector approach to the return of missing people as an opportunity for intervention and prevention \( **3.6**\). The peer\-reviewed research\-led impact strategy and outcomes of this project gained Parr and her team an ESRC *Outstanding Impact in Society* Award in 2015, which enabled new funding for helping to deliver professional educational events that facilitated **\(3\)** above \( **3.6**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The 2014 REF impact case study related to Parr’s ESRC project was based on a series of face\-to\-face education events with police officers using research findings for professional training. The post\-2014 research impact *extends* the purpose, depth and reach of the original training events and adds new sector\-level policy and practice impacts at different scales with a focus on *return*. Since 2014, the research impact has been extended via: **\(1\)** institutionalised UK police training interventions \(between 2014 and 2016\) around better handling of families and the missing person’s return, with evidence showing change in ‘professional practice’ for officers taking the direct training; **\(2\)** changes in police policy in 2014 and 2016 \(written into guidance for standards and operations\), for which sector leaders provide evidence of impact leading directly from the research into police policy change; **\(3\)** wider multi\-sector initiatives \(eg. *National Conversation ‘*returned missing’ events in England, Scotland and Wales\), for which sector leaders provide evidence of research\-led *change,* leading to: **\(i\)** new policy priorities and guidance in charity and government; **\(ii\)** Parr’s direct influence in strategic and invited national roles because of her research\-led expertise; and **\(iii\)** new Scottish government funded multi\-sector training in Scotland \(2018\-2020\) building directly on research findings; and **\(4\)** international reach in the Australian missing persons sector \(police and charity\). 

 **\(1\) Police training and changing professional practice:** Agreements with the College of Policing \(CoP\) and the internationally renowned Police National Search Centre \(PNSC\) led to the use of ‘missing people’s stories’ and other research findings as linked and core elements of both on\-line and in\-person training modules. The CoP on\-line modules have been taken by 138,722 officers between 2014 and 2020, linking officers to the research findings \( **Source: 5.1**\), while a direct taught module designed by Parr and Stevenson for search officers \(POLSAs\) who specialise in missing persons cases has been delivered to c.90 officers a year via the PNSC between 2014 and 2017. Evaluations by 300\+ police officers taking the PNSC training modules show substantial *anticipated* and *actual* change in professional practice, as evidenced here: 

 **Letter of evidence:** *“The University training package is having an impact on how officers understand their role in search, how they plan and deliver search with reference to the mind\-set of different missing people and how they engage with families of missing people. We also know that professional practice and the reputation of the police has been enhanced and changed as a result of engagement with this training package.”* \( **5.2**, **Module Lead, PSNC**, 2017\) 

 **Self\-reported evaluation example \(anticipated change: 5.3\):** 

 2014 Police Sergeant: *“I will have a more empathetic approach.”* 

 **Self\-reported evaluation examples \(actual change at 6 months: 5.3\):** 

 2015 Police Sergeant: *“The training has been useful. On one particular search it helped focus my mind planning the search strategy and helped me understand issues around the thoughts of the individual prior to going missing and where they may go.”* 

 2015 Police Sergeant: *“The family feedback  … was they were really impressed with the Police, they felt valued and felt we valued \[the missing person\] too.”* 

 2015 Search Advisor: *“I am more aware of what the missing person may be experiencing or considering, particularly when we are able to open a dialogue with them by email or telephone.”* 

 **\(2\) Direct influence on police policy \(standards and operations\):** The research has directly influenced England and Wales *Approved Professional Practice on Missing Persons* \(2016\) and Police Scotland’s *Standard Operating Procedures for Missing Persons* \(2014\) *.* These combined changes direct officers across the UK to adopt good practice in providing ‘return interviews’ when adults go missing *and* provide more consistent and compassionate liaison with families in missing cases, two core recommendations from the research. 

 **Letter of evidence:** *“Police Scotland is in the process of making significant changes into its management and investigation of missing persons. … The ESRC reports and recommendations have directly influenced our* Standard Operational Guidance *\(SOP\) launched in October 2014 \(sections 16 and 19\) issued to 13*− *14,000 staff. These sections relate to ‘Family Partnership’ and ‘Management of the Return’ where we have requested that return interviews require to take place. In addition, we have included a new section on good practice family liaison work.”* \( **5.4**, **National Missing Person Strategic Co\-ordinator, Police Scotland**, 2014\) 

 **Letter of evidence:** *“I can confirm … that the ‘Geographies of Missing People’ research project has had significant and far\-reaching impacts within the police service in England, Wales and Scotland in terms of provision of new officer education materials and adjustments to operational guidance.”* \( **5.4**, **Manager UK Bureau of Missing Persons**, 2015\) 

 Police Scotland also now report that 91.3% of all cases have had a return interview since 2017 \( **5.5**\). Return interviews are critical to future prevention and the research has directly influenced their adoption since the SOP in 2014 \(as evidenced above\). The impacts of these changes in professional practice in **\(1\)** and **\(2\)** are also being assessed at a sector level in Scotland via the current evaluation of the *National Framework* \(2020: see below\) \( **5.6**\). 

 **\(3\) Directly changing government policy guidance with implications for professional practice:** Parr was invited as a research expert, using the research findings, to serve on two different Scottish Government Working Groups to help develop the first national government policy guidance on missing people: the *National Framework for Missing Persons in Scotland* \(2017\). This guidance had four main objectives and an implementation plan to support a new multi\-agency approach to deliver best practice for missing people and their families across all areas of Scotland. Parr was then invited to Chair an *Independent Working Group For Missing Persons* \(2019\-2021\) to evaluate the impact of these developments, and this group reported to the Scottish Government Minister for Community Safety in 2020 highlighting evidence of good practice and areas for improvement \( **5.6**\). 

 **Letter of evidence:** *“Professor Parr and the research gathered in the ‘Geographies of Missing People’ have played a critical role in the development of the Framework.”* \( **5.6**, **Scottish Government Lead on the National Missing Person’s Framework for Scotland**, 2017\) 

 **Letter of evidence:** *“Professor Parr’s ‘Geographies of Missing People’ research helped to inform and shape the Framework and so it is very welcome that she has continued to help guide this work since publication in 2017. Professor Parr’s national reputation in missing persons research has been important in taking this work forward and that is why I asked her to Chair the Working Group for Missing People in 2019 … The Working Group’s update report \[was\] published on 10 September 2020 ... The recommendations have been well received and will help inform and influence the next steps the Scottish Government takes … to implement the Framework’s aims through policy development and investment to enhance the good practice already in place.”* \( **5.6**, **Minister for Community Safety**, 2020\) 

 **\(4\) Directly influencing the Missing People Charity services and policy priorities:** The charity Missing People has directly used the research findings to develop new service interventions \(eg. the *Aftercare Service, Wales*\) to address the needs of returned missing people in their service strategy. The charity co\-delivered a series of *National Conversation Events* in 2016 \( **5.7**\) with Parr to lead sector change on professional response to return. Parr is part of a group that oversees the work of the Missing People’s *National Co\-ordinator for Scotland*, a post funded by the Scottish Government as a result of the National Framework. The research is thus being used in ways that directly benefit missing people and their families via charity developments. To support implementation the Scottish government commissioned the *National Training for the Efficacy of the Scottish* *National Framework* \(2017−2018\), and Parr worked with Missing People to provide new ‘returned discussion’ training for 342 multi\-sector professionals in 85% of Scotland’s local authority areas. Evaluation shows increased knowledge and capacity to help returned missing persons by non\-police professionals: 100% of trainees report being better able to conduct a return discussion \( **5.7**, **Missing People Charity Report**, 2019\). 

 **Letter of evidence:** *“The research has had a huge impact on the charity, both in terms of our direct service provision and on our policy and campaigning work.* *We have used some of the key findings of the original research to build a case for funding a pilot of a pioneering new service – Aftercare. I have been working closely with Hester on the ‘Returned Missing’ brief. The charity invested staff time and resource in these events … They have been extremely effective interventions – raising the issue of prevention and response at a national level.”* \( **5.7**, **Research Manager, Missing People Charity**, 2017\) 

 **Letter of evidence:** *“As Director of Policy and Development at the Missing People charity, I can confirm that the ‘Geographies of Missing People’ research findings and recommendations had direct influence on new service developments at the charity. As a result of the research we also worked with Hester Parr to put in place a series of event on ‘return’ in 2015 and 2016. We continue to be influenced by the research findings in our policy and practice work. The research has had significant impact on both service delivery and policy priorities in the charity and beyond.”* \( **5.7**, **Director of Policy and Development**, **Missing People Charity**, 2020\) 

 Missing People invited Parr to give evidence at MP Ann Coffey’s Westminster All Party Parliamentary Group \( *APPG\)* to safeguard vulnerable adults \( **5.7**\). This meeting led to the establishment of the National Task and Finish Group to improve multi\-agency response to missing people in England. 

 **\(5\) Sector recognition of impact \(peer reviewed\):** The research impact described above has been recognised in a series of national awards \( **5.8**\). 

 **\(6\) International reach:** The research has international reach, being disseminated via the Australian Federal Police and influencing the Australian NGO Missing Persons Advocacy Network \(MPAN\): *‘it would be very safe to say that the work that you’ve produced has undoubtedly impacted the scene here in Australia”* \( **5.9**, **Founder and CEO, MPAN**, 2020\); and, relatedly, MPAN has now developed a strategy to ‘humanise’ missing people.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Sheffield research on the psychological consequences of skin conditions has helped to shape **policy recommendations** to increase psycho\-dermatology services and **clinical guidelines** to improve patient care. Sheffield research has also been incorporated into: **training** for health professionals, including e\-modules for NHS/social care personnel \(730 completed modules\) and dermatology nurses \(800 views/month\) and a leading practitioner handbook on cognitive behavioural interventions for visible conditions \(559 sales worldwide\); **psychological interventions** for people with skin conditions, including self\-help online resources provided by the British Association of Dermatologists \(6,000\+ visits/year\) and NHS/IAPT services \(6,000\+ visits/year\); and collaborations with **skin charities**. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Context** 

 Skin conditions comprise the fourth leading cause of nonfatal global disease burden. 60% of the UK population suffer, or have suffered, from a skin condition \(British Skin Foundation, 2020\). In 2016, over 13 million people visited their GP with a skin condition, costing the NHS £723m; 85% reported that psychosocial aspects were a significant part of their condition \(Dermatology Expert Working Group, 2018\). Research and development \(R&D\) investment in skin conditions in the UK is underfunded by £155m p.a. \(APPGS, 2020\). 

 **Research** 

 Research at Sheffield led by Thompson \(funded by ESRC, METRC, Healing Foundation, British Skin Foundation, Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Association, Alopecia UK\) has documented the severity of psychological reactions to living with common skin conditions \(e.g. alopecia, eczema, psoriasis, vitiligo\), highlighted a substantial and unmet need for psychological interventions, identified key variables underlying people’s psychological reactions, and developed and evaluated interventions to reduce psychological distress. 

 **Psychological consequences of skin conditions and the need for psychological interventions** 

 An influential review \(200\+ citations\) of adaptation to disfigurement by Thompson and Kent identified substantial gaps in knowledge of the psychosocial consequences of visible skin conditions \[ **R1**\]. These included a lack of research and understanding of the role of psychological variables and the challenges experienced by people living with appearance\-related conditions, along with a lack of evidence\-based interventions. 

 To address these research gaps, Sheffield researchers subsequently conducted: \(i\) qualitative studies to investigate people’s experiences of living with skin conditions – e.g. **R2** highlighted the “overwhelming” experience of living with vitiligo and the use of a range of cognitive and behavioural strategies that helped people to adjust psychologically; and \(ii\) systematic reviews and meta\-analyses on the psychological impact of skin conditions and the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions – e.g. a Cochrane review \[ **R3**\] reported some positive effects of psycho\-educational interventions on disease severity and quality of life in childhood eczema, but also highlighted the sparseness of evidence\-based interventions. 

 **Psychological determinants of adjustment to skin conditions** 

 In response to the need to develop evidence\-based interventions, Sheffield researchers have conducted research on the psychological predictors of adjustment to skin conditions \(e.g. attentional bias, cognitive flexibility, mindfulness\) \[ **R4**\]. This research, along with our qualitative work \[ **R2**\], has been used to develop interventions to reduce psychological distress associated with skin conditions, including psycho\-education, attention refocusing and relaxation \[ **R5**\]. 

 **Psychological interventions for people with skin conditions** 

 Based on this underlying research, Sheffield researchers have developed and evaluated a number of self\-help interventions for specific skin conditions. **R5** found that a psychosocial self\-help intervention led to clinically significant reductions in social anxiety associated with vitiligo. 

 Thompson was also the regional principal investigator on the UK\-wide ‘Appearance Research Collaboration’ study in 2013, which was the largest study \(N=1265\) conducted to date on visible difference. The findings formed the empirical basis of recommended cognitive behavioural interventions for people affected by visible difference \(e.g. skin conditions\) that were detailed in the first, and leading, practitioner handbook in the field \[ **R6**\].

 **Policy recommendations and clinical guidelines** 

 The **All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Skin \(APPGS\) 2020 Report** \[ **S1**\] cited Sheffield research on the psychological impact of skin conditions \[ **R1, R2, R4**\] and educational and psychological interventions \[ **R3, R5**\] as evidence for policy recommendations for the routine psychological monitoring of people with skin conditions and increased access to specialist mental health support. The report specifically recommended including skin\-specific care pathways in all IAPT services, highlighting a “model service” based on Sheffield research. 

 **British Association of Dermatologists \(BAD\) 2020 clinical guidelines for the management of vitiligo** were presented in 2020 at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress \[ **S2**\]. The updated guidelines cited Sheffield research on the psychological impact of vitiligo \[ **R2**\] and the benefits of self\-help \[ **R5**\] as evidence for recommendations that: clinicians discuss the psychosocial impact of vitiligo with patients \(\#3\); quality of life and psychological distress are routinely monitored \(\#5\); and self\-help resources are provided for those experiencing mild psychological distress \(\#23\). BAD has 1,000\+ members. The guidelines were due to be published in 2020 but delayed until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

 Sheffield research \[ **R3, R5, R6**\] has been cited as evidence for the recommended use of education and CBT in the management of atopic dermatitis in **Europe \(2018**\) \[ **S3**\], **Malaysia \(2018\)**, **India \(2019\)** and **Japan \(2020\)** and pruritus in **Germany \(2016\)**, and psychological work with vitiligo **\(American Academy of Pediatrics, 2015\)** and pigmentation disorders **\(American Academy of Family Physicians, 2017\)**. 

 **Training for clinicians** 

 **NHS e\-health learning dermatology modules** on psychosocial management, assessment, and interventions for dermatology patients, developed in collaboration with Thompson in 2017 and incorporating Sheffield research, form part of the British Association of Dermatologists’ consultant curriculum \(there are 650 UK consultant dermatologists\). They are freely available to NHS and social care workers in the UK and to international and private health and social care providers via a fee\-paying provider. To date, \[Text removed for publication\] modules have been completed by NHS/social care personnel and fee\-paying users \[ **S4**\]. 

 **British Dermatological Nursing Group \(BDNG\) training materials.** Thompson has produced clinical skills training materials for nurses on the assessment and management of psychological issues in dermatology that incorporates Sheffield research. These have been published in the BDNG’s professional journal \[Text removed for publication\] and are available as clinical skills e\-resources \[Text removed for publication\]. Thompson delivered associated training to 300\+ practitioners at the 2018 Annual Dermatology Nursing Conference. These activities have “positively contributed to the strategic aims of the BDNG” to promote high quality care for dermatological patients \[ **S5**\]. 

 The leading **practitioner handbook on CBT** for people affected by visible difference \[ **R6**\] with 559 sales across all world regions \[ **S6**\]. Recommended by the skin charity, Changing Faces, as “required reading” for practitioners \[ **S10**\]. 

 Since 2013, Thompson has delivered 30\+ **training sessions** based on Sheffield research to dermatologists, dermatology nurses, and NHS/IAPT staff \[ **S5, S10**\]. Thompson has also developed specific training for NHS/IAPT Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners \(PWPs\) on the assessment and management of conditions affecting appearance. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 **Psychological interventions** 

 **The British Association of Dermatologists** **Skin Support** **website** launched in 2015 contains resources and self\-help materials developed by Sheffield researchers \[ **R5**\]. 2019 usage data indicates 6,313 visits to pages containing self\-help materials. These materials can also be accessed via a Skin Support Personal Evaluation questionnaire \(40,941 visits\) \[ **S8**\]. Evaluations indicate very positive ratings: 80% of users would use the website again and 87% of dermatology professionals would recommend the website to someone with a skin condition \[ **S9**\]. 

 **Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust** introduced a skin\-specific pathway into their health and wellbeing IAPT in 2018, based on Sheffield research and including Sheffield self\-help materials \[ **R5**\] \[Text removed for publication\]. The APPGS 2020 Report highlighted this “model service”, recommending that all Clinical Commissioning Groups implement such a care pathway as part of IAPT provision \[ **S3**\]. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 **Work of skin charities** 

 Thompson has long\-term collaborations, including advisory roles, with **UK and international skin charities** \- Changing Faces \(2019\-present\), Katie Piper Foundation \(2013\-2018\), Alopecia UK \(2018\-2020\), Vitiligo Society \(2017\-present\), International Vitiligo Foundation \(2014\-present\), and Vitiligo Support and Awareness Foundation, Nigeria \(2013\-2017\). In these collaborations, Thompson has used Sheffield research to provide training materials and events for clinicians, develop and evaluate psychosocial support services, and support public awareness campaigns. As an example, Changing Faces concluded that Sheffield research “has had a significant impact on our work as the leading charity in the area of disfigurement that, in turn, has impacted on the services we provide to people living with visible differences” \[ **S10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Huntington’s Disease \(HD\) is a debilitating and fatal neurodegenerative illness affecting approximately 4\-10 people per 100,000 population. There are currently no licensed disease\-modifying treatments. The lack of robust markers for disease progression has hitherto hampered the development of therapies. A UCL\-led international observational study of Huntington’s disease has transformed understanding of disease progression and enabled the development of biomarkers and clinical tools that have accelerated major industry\-led therapeutic trials in humans. These tools led directly to the world’s first\-in\-human Phase 1b/2a trial of an antisense oligonucleotide \(ASO\) with promising results, leading Roche Pharmaceuticals to exercise a USD45m licence agreement to progress the drug. The tools are currently being implemented in a pivotal phase 3 trial, bringing a potential treatment for HD significantly closer.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 HD is a devastating inherited neurological condition, which leads to progressive loss of cognitive and motor function and the development of neuropsychiatric disturbance. It is caused by a mutation which codes for the production of the toxic mutant huntingtin protein that slowly damages neurons leading to brain dysfunction and cell death. Following the discovery of the gene in 1993, a predictive genetic test was developed allowing research teams to study gene carriers several years before the expected onset of clinical symptoms, known as the premanifest phase. Although some of the symptoms of the disease can be treated, there are currently no disease\-modifying treatments licensed for HD. Novel therapeutic agents with the potential to halt or slow the underlying disease processes are in development, but there was an urgent need to identify sensitive, reproducible and robust markers of progression from the premanifest stage through to established disease in order to assess treatment efficacy. 

 From 2008 to 2014 Professor Tabrizi led the large multi\-site observational *TRACK\-HD* study **\[R1\]** funded by the CHDI Foundation, a not\-for\-profit organisation dedicated to finding treatments for HD. This study brought together a multi\-disciplinary team of world experts in imaging, neuropsychiatry, cognitive and motor function and collected data from four internationally\-renowned HD research centres: UCL, Leiden University Medical Centre, ICM in Paris and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. *TRACK\-HD* aimed to critically evaluate potential biomarkers for use in future clinical trials in HD by annual follow\-up of a cohort of early\-HD and premanifest gene carriers as well as healthy controls \[ **R2, R3, R4\]**. Novel imaging, cognitive, motor, neuropsychiatric and biofluid measures, were standardised across sites and collected, quality controlled and monitored in a similar way to a clinical trial. A range of robust measures from multiple domains suitable for use in clinical trials and sensitive to disease effects across the spectrum of HD were identified **\[R3\]**. Notably, imaging measures identified brain changes in premanifest gene carriers up to 15 years before the expected onset of symptoms, in the absence of a behavioural phenotype **\[R1, R2, R3, R4, R5\]**. This information is invaluable in identifying the optimum time window for intervention, since it raises the possibility of slowing or halting these degenerative processes whilst function is still intact. *TRACK\-HD* has given rise to over 40 publications, including six articles in the *Lancet Neurology* and has resulted in the following measurable outcomes which have had a major impact on the field of treatment in neurodegeneration: 

1.  An unparalleled deep phenotypic database resource freely available for both the research community and pharmaceutical companies designing clinical trials for potential treatments in HD. 

1.  Development of validated biomarkers, standardised across multiple sites, for use in clinical trials: 

  1.  The first human assay for huntingtin, the toxic protein which causes HD pathology **\[R5\]** 

  1.  Measures of global and regional brain atrophy indicative of neuronal loss **\[R2\]** 

  1.  The composite Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale \(cUHDRS\), a functional measure of disease progression **\[R6\]** developed by Roche using TRACK\-HD data in collaboration with TRACK\-HD investigators. 

 As a direct result of her leadership of TRACK\-HD, Tabrizi was appointed global lead investigator on a phase 1b/2a safety trial of the ASO drug IONIS\-HTT<sub>Rx</sub> sponsored by Ionis Pharmaceuticals from 2015 to 2017. The trial demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability, as well as crucially showing treatment\-related lowering of mutant huntingtin levels **\[R7\]**. Tabrizi is UK Chief Investigator, PI for the UCLH site, and a senior advisor on the strategic steering committee for the Roche Phase 3 efficacy trial in HD.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The robust, reproducible and sensitive markers of disease progression provided by TRACK\-HD **\[R1\]** gave Ionis Pharmaceuticals the confidence they needed to move forward with a trial of a potentially disease\-modifying treatment. These measures were well understood and their low variability clearly established, so they provided sufficient power to suggest relatively small sample size requirements. Importantly they set the standard for evaluating clinical trial results, enabling a greater understanding of the safety of this treatment and its efficacy in slowing disease progression. 

 **Phase 1b/2a safety trial in HD \(2015\-2017\), sponsored by Ionis Pharmaceuticals** 

 In 2015 Ionis Pharmaceuticals instigated the world’s first\-in\-human clinical trial of an ASO in HD **\[S1\],** aiming to lower levels of mutant huntingtin in patients with early HD. It was described by HD Buzz \(the research newsletter for the UK Huntington’s community\) as “ *the most exciting drug trial so far in Huntington’s disease*” **\[S2\]**. The trial, led by Tabrizi, reported excellent safety and tolerability, with treatment\-related lowering of mutant huntingtin levels. The extensive worldwide press coverage of the results demonstrates their status as a ray of hope for HD sufferers \(of whom there are over 8,000 in the UK alone\). The Chief Executive of the Huntington’s Disease Association said “ *This is a great day for the Huntington’s community. Today's announcement of the results of the trial are of groundbreaking importance to families affected by Huntington's disease. Although there is still some way to go before the overall results are known, this is a big step forward*” **\[S3\]**. HD Buzz hailed it as “ *one of the biggest breakthroughs in Huntington’s disease since the discovery of the HD gene in 1993”* and the Guardian selected it as one of 2017’s top ten positive news stories **\[S2\]**. 

 The ready\-to\-use and validated biomarkers in HD developed by TRACK\-HD data were critical to the design of the Ionis trial, which was led globally by UCL: 

-  The first human assay for huntingtin was a primary outcome measure for the trial **\[S1\]**. ASO treatment aims to lower levels of mutant huntingtin \(mHTT\) with the hope of reducing the pathological effect of this toxic protein. Only with this validated assay were Ionis able to demonstrate target engagement and show a dose\-dependent reduction in mHTT levels in response to treatment. 

-  The cUHDRS was an exploratory measure that assesses meaningful changes in disease progression. This tool suggested clinical improvement in those receiving treatment even in this small trial of just 46 patients. 

 Ionis praised the *“successful execution”* of Track\-HD, which “ *provides confidence in the feasibility of conducting quality clinical research in HD, which encourages drug development”.* Moreover its “ *extensive patient community outreach… demonstrated that HD patients were willing to participate in a multi\-year study with a substantial time commitment.  All drug companies that followed benefitted from Track\-HD’s impact on the HD community’s commitment to research”* **\[S4\].** Tabrizi’s appointment as Global Lead Investigator for the Ionis trial was an easy choice as she “ *stood out as a key expert given her leadership of Track\-HD”* **\[S4\].** 

 **Phase 3 efficacy trial in HD \(ongoing\), sponsored by Roche** 

 The promising results of the Ionis trial convinced pharmaceutical company Roche to exercise a USD45m licence for the drug. They proceeded rapidly to a Pivotal Phase 3 efficacy trial with 909 participants, which began in January 2019 and is due to continue until June 2022 **\[S5\]**. Roche’s decision to licence Ionis’ drug and proceed to efficacy trials was entirely dependent upon the results from the Ionis safety trial, which in turn were underpinned by the findings of *TRACK\-HD.* As with the Ionis efficacy trials, Tabrizi has been integral to the design, implementation and interpretation of Roche’s programme, acting as Global Academic Lead on the trial’s Strategic Steering Committee, drafting the trial protocol, and leading the UCL/UCLH study site as PI. 

 The design of the large and global Phase 3 efficacy trial **\[S5\]** \(named GENERATION\-HD1\) has been strongly influenced by tools derived from TRACK\-HD data, specifically the implementation of: 

1.  The cUHDRS as the global primary endpoint, with the support of the EMA. 

1.  The novel huntingtin assay, to assess levels of mHTT as a secondary outcome measure 

1.  Measures of regional and whole brain atrophy, as secondary outcome measures 

 Senior figures in Roche’s clinical team state “ *TRACK\-HD has been a critical dataset for the design of GENERATION\-HD1. \[…\] For the development of potential therapies that target underlying disease pathology, it is critical to relate changes in clinical outcome assessments with candidate biomarkers. At the time, TRACK\-HD was unrivalled in its ability to provide such timely and critical information that has advanced our understanding, and continues to serve as a critical reference sample against which we can evaluate clinical trial findings. The conduct of TRACK\-HD is more similar to a clinical trial setting than other natural history studies, providing rates of change in both clinical outcome assessments and biomarkers that serve as a stronger reference against which to estimate potential placebo decline for use in study design and sample size calculations. The TRACK\-HD dataset was the starting point for the creation of the cUHDRS, a scoring algorithm that combines four widely used scales into a single summary score. \[…\] The cUHDRS is the global primary endpoint in GENERATION\-HD1; therefore, TRACK\-HD has provided a pivotal role in the development of the key determinant of success in a pivotal clinical trial*” **\[S6\].** 

 Alongside the pivotal Phase 3 trial, Roche are running a complementary Natural History study to chart disease progression in a matched ‘control’ group of participants **\[S7\]**. This study also uses the cUHDRS, mHTT assay and measures of brain atrophy developed in TRACK\-HD. 

 **Hope for the HD community** 

 The significance of successful progress to the first long\-term efficacy trial of a disease modifying therapy in HD to the patients, families and carers faced with realities of this devastating disease cannot be overestimated. In the weeks following the publication of results from the Ionis safety trials in December 2017, Tabrizi and her team at the HD Centre were inundated with thousands of emails from those affected by HD. A common theme throughout these messages and the numerous articles written on the disease since is one of hope: **\[S8, S9\]** 

-  *“I just want to express how much your study has given me and my family so much hope”* 

-  *“How exciting to read something that gives some hope\!”* 

-  *“There has been no hope in the many years my father battled the disease until your research”* 

-  *“When the news broke yesterday it took my breath away, so much hope looking to the future”* 

-  *“I read the article on the trial that was just completed. It gives me great hope that one day this awful disease will be gone”* **\[S10\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research from Oxford University has driven widespread changes towards more healthy and sustainable, plant\-based diets. In particular, this work has conclusively demonstrated that a global shift towards plant\-based diets would deliver significant environmental and health co\-benefits, and be the most effective dietary option to address climate change. By modelling the potential impact of policy options for different countries, including fiscal incentives, the researchers demonstrated that widespread taxes on red and processed meat would be one of the most effective means to achieve this. These studies have been recognised by international agencies and parliamentary bodies, raising the global agenda for healthy and sustainable diets. A particularly influential report based on this research, *Food in the Anthropocene*, sparked intense media interest and extensive social media discussions. Ultimately, this contributed to action at country, city, business and individual level, with increased positive attitudes towards plant\-based diets and demonstrable falls in meat consumption.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research from the University of Oxford has significantly contributed to the definition of a healthy and sustainable diet, explored both the environmental and health consequences of global changes in diet, and modelled the impact of national food policies. This has been achieved through a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach which for the first time enabled dietary policies for population health to be simultaneously quantified in terms of their resource use, climate change impacts and health impacts. Using dietary data from a long\-term cohort study involving 65,000 participants, University of Oxford researchers produced the first study analysing the dietary climate change impacts of 2,041 vegans, 15,751 vegetarians, and 37,712 meat eaters \[1\]. Until this work, the question of whether low meat diets were better for the environment was the subject of debate. The results conclusively demonstrated that real\-life, plant\-based diets have far lower carbon footprints than diets high in animal products. Building on this work, the researchers developed a global food\-health\-environment model to estimate the impact of food systems in 2050. This model had country\-level resolution, using data on food production and trade in each country, and combined meta\-analyses of nutritional epidemiology to estimate the health impacts of the scenarios. With this detail, the research team were able to perform the first comprehensive assessment of the climate\-change and health implications of a global transition towards plant\-based diets, including an economic valuation of the health and climate\-change co\-benefits \[2\]. In collaboration with the International Food Policy Research Institute, University of Oxford researchers integrated this model with a global agriculture economics model, which projected scenarios based on assumptions of climate change, population growth and global development trajectories for over 150 countries \[3\]. The researchers also led a broad collaboration involving experts in environmental change, agriculture economics and life cycle analysis to produce the first study which comprehensively assessed food\-system options to stay within planetary boundaries by 2050. This explored at country level the impacts of reducing food loss and waste, changing technologies and management practices, and dietary change towards healthier diets. Researchers at University of Oxford developed the scenarios, conducted the analyses and were lead authors on the resultant paper \[4\]. 

 The food\-health\-environment model developed for this was then applied by University of Oxford researchers to estimate the impact of national food policies for multiple countries. This included an assessment of the impact of health\-motivated taxes for red and processed meat for all major world regions on health and sustainability outcomes \[5\]. Unlike most public health analyses of food taxation, the integrated model accounts for feedback in production and trade associated with raised prices for red and processed meat providing a more conservative assessment of the total impact. This found that widespread taxes on red and processed meat \(set at the optimum level for each country\) would result in a 9% reduction in the global number of deaths attributable to red and processed meat consumption, with a 14% decrease in attributable healthcare costs.

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  A new global policy agenda for healthy and sustainable diets 

 The dietary scenarios developed in study \[4\] were the centrepiece of a highly influential report by the international EAT\-Lancet commission in 2019: ‘Food in the Anthropocene’ \[A\]. This provided a template for global food\-based dietary guidelines. The report concluded that international health, sustainability and climate change objectives would only be achieved with a radical population\-level shift towards plant\-based diets. In addition to generating considerable media interest \(see below\), this report resulted in international policy action. At the C40 Mayoral Summit in October 2019, 14 global cities committed to city\-level policy change to align with EAT\-Lancet’s recommendations \[B\]. The report has also helped shape new national dietary guidelines that incorporate sustainability, including for Indonesia and Norway. EAT\-Lancet also formed the basis of a new policy document from the International Association of Medical students to integrate nutrition and sustainability into global medical curriculums \[C\]. 

 The research studies have also influenced United Nations \(UN\) climate negotiations, including meetings of the Conference of the Parties \(COP\) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2017 \(COP23\) and 2018 \(COP24\). The research evidence and recommendations were cited in subsequent COP publications: for instance, the WHO’s COP24 Special Report *Health and Climate Change* \[Di\] states: ‘ *A synergistic combination of supply and demand measures to increase consumption of diets with more fruit and vegetables, produced sustainably and ideally locally, will be necessary to gain the potential health and environmental benefits’,* citing \[4\] *.* The research studies also informed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) special reports on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius \(2018\) \[Dii\] and on Land \(2019\) \[Diii\]; and in several UN reports, including those of the Standing Committee on Nutrition. For example, the IPCC special report on land \[Diii\] states *‘Consistent evidence indicates that, in general, a dietary pattern that is higher in plant\-based foods… is more health\-promoting and associated with lower environmental impact…\[than\] current global average diets’,* citing \[2\], \[3\] and \[4\]. The University of Oxford also jointly published with the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation the report ‘ *Plates, pyramids, planet’* \[Ei\], citing \[1\], which found that only four countries worldwide integrated sustainability within their food\-based dietary guidelines for health, prompting more countries to begin doing this. The report \[Ei\] was cited in the 2018 WHO information booklet on healthy and sustainable diets \[Eii\] which stated that ‘ *A healthy diet should be sustainably produced and consumed, and there is growing evidence that human health and environment ‘win\-wins’ are possible’.* This represented a new policy direction: prior to this, WHO dietary guidelines focused on health outcomes, without integrating environmental objectives. Fiscal policies, as modelled by \[5\], to achieve healthy and sustainable diets have now become prominent issues for European Governments; in particular, a tax on processed and red meat was discussed by a meeting of the European Parliament and has featured in election campaigns \(e.g. Denmark and Finland\). 

####  Impact on the UK policy arena 

 The EAT\-Lancet study \[A\] was directly referred to during oral evidence sessions for the Parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee inquiry into Planetary Health, and the recommendations in the resulting 2017 report, *Our Planet, Our Health* \[Fi\], draw on those of the EAT\-Lancet study, for example: *‘One of the key messages of the recent EAT–Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems was that: “Transformation to healthy diets from sustainable food systems is necessary to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals \[SDGs\] and the Paris Agreement”’*. The report also cited the EAT\-Lancet Commission as part of its recommendation that *‘The Government should …consider using financial incentives to promote access to, and consumption of, healthy and sustainably produced food’.* The underlying research papers \[2,4,5\] were also cited in the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology’s 2019 policy briefing paper on Climate Change and Agriculture \[Fii\] and the Committee on Climate Change \(CCC\)’s 2020 report on land use in the UK \[Fiii\] as evidence supporting a population level shift to plant\-based diets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The CCC report made the specific recommendation to ‘ *reduce… the consumption of beef, lamb and dairy by at least 20% per person’* \[Fiii\]. In January 2020, the Behavioural Insights Team published an evidence review outlining the 12 most effective strategies to promote healthy and sustainable diets \[Fiv\]. This called for carbon taxes on food products to be introduced: ‘ *Many health professionals have become proponents for a meat tax to save lives’*, citing publication \[5\]. 

 MPs have acknowledged the role of University of Oxford research in driving forward the debate on healthy and sustainable diets in numerous parliamentary debates. For instance, during a debate in the House of Commons on ‘Environment and Climate Change’ in May 2019, Kerry McCarthy \(MP for Bristol East\) said *‘If we do not make changes, the food and farming system will singlehandedly use up our Paris climate agreement emissions budget within the next 30 years…There have been endless wake\-up calls, including from the UN, the IPCC, EAT\-Lancet, Chatham House, academics from Harvard and Oxford, and many more…*’. Health and sustainability are now firmly integrated into Government food production policy, as demonstrated by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ 2020 Progress Report: Farming for the Future \[G\]. This states *‘The next 10 years are a period of significant change and 2021 represents the first step of government and farmers working together to invest in farming business, public goods and the production of safe, healthy and sustainable food*.’ Several MPs have also given public support in favour of government\-enforced financial incentives to increase access to healthy and sustainable food products, including Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavillion, at the 2019 Oxford Farming Conference. 

####  Impact on business and investment decisions 

 The World Economic Forum \(WEF\) commissioned University of Oxford researchers to write a review on alternative proteins as part of their discussion series on the future of meat. The report \[Hi\] drew upon the modelling analyses developed for the studies outlined above. The subsequent WEF white paper *Meat: The Future, A Roadmap for Delivering 21st\-Century Protein* \[Hii\] cited this commissioned report extensively as supporting evidence, for instance: *‘\[Hi\] highlights that replacing a single daily portion of beef \(and to a lesser extent both pork and chicken\) with the studied alternatives \(beans, pulses, mycoproteins, nuts etc.\) can reduce diet\-related mortality in high\-income and upper\-middle\-income countries by up to 5%, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions’.* This paper was sent to delegates and discussed at the World Business Council on Sustainable Development \(WBCSD\) in December 2018\). In its 2020 report on assessment of risks in the food and agriculture sector \[Hiii\], the WBCSD said: *‘The report issued by the EAT\-Lancet Commission* \[A\] *in February 2019 outlines how to deliver a sustainable and healthy food system for 10 billion* \[10,000,000,000\] *people within the boundaries of the planet by 2050…This is an opportunity for governments to set regional\- and country\-specific targets and regulations’*. 

 In June 2020 FAIRR \(Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return\), a global network of investors managing over USD20,000,000,000,000 of assets, published *The Livestock Levy: Progress Report* \[I\] in which they concluded that ‘ *momentum is clearly building in European capitals*’ for an EU\-wide meat tax. The research was invoked extensively as supporting evidence in the report, for instance: *‘Research by Oxford University concludes that a health tax on red and processed meat could save over $40 bn* \[USD40,000,000,000\] *in global healthcare costs’,* as found in \[5\] *.* The report’s recommendations for investors in the animal protein sector include reducing meat content in composite products and adopting supply standards that mitigate health and environmental risks. 

 The EAT\-Lancet report \[A\] has inspired pilot projects from major food service companies to move towards healthier and more sustainable products and menus. This includes the Compass Group, the world’s largest foodservice company, whose Sustainability Director wrote: 

 “*Our sustainability strategy is focused on taking targeted actions where we believe they will have the greatest impact…This exciting pilot with EAT allows us to test key elements from the EAT\-Lancet report and use it to inform our business decisions*” \[J\]. 

####  Impact on public discourse 

 The EAT\-Lancet report \[A\] sparked considerable public debate about the merits of plant\-based diets, having been featured in over 5,800 articles in 118 countries, and shared over 1,000,000,000 times on social media in the year following its publication. The report and the research \[1–5\] received widespread coverage in traditional media, documentary films and podcasts, including *BBC News, Sky News, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian*. The researchers have been interviewed about their work on Radio 4’s *Today* programme, and other programmes including BBC’s *Trust me, I’m a doctor* \(1,410,000 episode views\) and *Countryfile* \(4,860,000 episode views\). Documentary films have included *The End of Meat* \(9/2017, Germany\) and *\#Powerplant* \(2/2019, Netherlands\), as well the video *How could veganism change the world?* for *The Economist* \(780,000 views\). For the latter, approximately 94% of reactions \(likes/dislikes\) were positive. Opinion pieces in national newspapers have described how this research has motivated dietary change e.g. in *the Guardian*: *‘I have changed what I eat because of the now overwhelming evidence of global environmental damage caused by meat and dairy production… If the world’s diet doesn’t change, <ins>we simply can’t beat climate change</ins>* \[embedded link to EAT\-Lancet report \[A\]\]’ *.* Marco Springmann also summarised the main research findings from \[1\-5\]  in a ‘TEDx’ talk \(5/2019\) which has been viewed over 16,000 times, with approximately 81% of reactions \(likes/dislikes\) being positive. 

 The researchers also engaged the UK film and TV industry at screenwriter workshops including BAFTA Screenwriting for Sustainability \(6/2016\), BBC Eco\-Enders \(10/2018\), and BAFTA Soap Sustainability Story Summit \(6/2019\). This led to greater understanding within the sector of the health and environmental rationale for plant\-based diets, as testified by the Head of Industry Sustainability at BAFTA \[K\]: ‘ *Peter Scarborough and the team at Oxford have helped the industry to get to grips with \(climate change\). Bringing the scientific and creative community together in this way would not have been possible without the department’s detailed understanding and passionate delivery’*. In 2018, Coronation Street \(viewing figures of approximately 6,000,000 people\) ran a story featuring vegan diets, while in October 2020 EastEnders \(viewing figures pf approximately 5,000,000 people\) stopped serving meat products on screen, using vegetarian alternatives instead in order to avoid waste and reduce its carbon footprint – a decision that generated significant media attention. 

 Several surveys \[L\] indicate that greater awareness of the environmental and health consequences of animal\-based foods has led to more individual action to reduce meat consumption. These indicate that the number of vegans in the UK quadrupled from 150,000 in 2014 to 600,000 in 2019 \(The Vegan Society\) and that in 2019, a quarter \(26%\) of those who describe themselves as meat\-eaters \(rather than plant\-based flexitarians\) were actively trying to reduce their meat consumption \(YouGov\). The UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey has shown a downward trend in consumption of red and processed meat between 2008/09 and 2016/17. Worldwide participants in the annual Veganuary campaign steadily increased from 3,000 in 2014 to over 400,000 in 2020, with around 50% saying they would continue a vegan diet at the month’s end. University of Oxford research has been cited in Veganuary’s campaign materials, for instance in the following Twitter post from December 2019: ‘ *\#Veganuary2020 starts in just two weeks time\!\!\! Recent Oxford Uni research concluded that, ‘a vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet earth*’.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In her film *Kuannersuit; Kvanefjeld*, Professor Lise Autogena investigated and documented potentially devastating environmental and societal risks from uranium mining in Greenland and exposed how cultural taboos in dealing with conflicts, prevented democratic participation. The resulting arts\-led interventions have: 1. Illuminated and confronted the issue of flawed government stakeholder engagement; 2. Highlighted cultural taboos in dealing with conflicts in Greenland and enabled democratic participation; 3. Provided a route to greater awareness of the risks of uranium mining and to the democratisation of radiation monitoring; 4. Enabled collaboration between indigenous communities and increased understanding of the complex issues contextualising uranium mining and traditional land use; 5. Created new reference points in contemporary art discourse. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Autogena’s research considered the cultural and societal issues impacting on a consultation process concerning uranium mining in South Greenland. This was achieved by direct engagement with local communities, experts and government officials in Greenland, Denmark and the EU. Through filmed documentation, artworks and artistic interventions, the research aimed to identify key issues in the flawed relationship between the democratic stakeholders. 

 Since 2000 Autogena has developed a significant body of cross\-disciplinary work that involved communities and organisations in large\-scale dialogues. Since 2013 she has been part of the research programme, Nuclear Culture, that explored how the arts might facilitate wider public conversation with the nuclear industry \[ **R1**\]. In 2013, she presented a position paper to an audience of nuclear anthropologists, physicists and stakeholders at the International Socio\-technical Challenges for Implementing Geological Disposal \(InSOTEC\) conference in Berlin. It highlighted the secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry, and subsequent impact on democratic debate and engagement with radioactive waste storage and argued for the value of cultural approaches to bring these issues into the public realm \[ **R2**\]. 

 Next, Autogena started to follow the political and democratic process in the establishment of a foreign\-owned, large\-scale uranium and rare earth mining project at Kvanefjeld, a mountain located in South Greenland. The region is characterized by small towns and a widely dispersed indigenous population of sheep farmers, keen to maintain their traditional way of life. The project revealed the challenges faced by the Greenland Government as it deliberated on using mining to diversify the country’s economy while pursuing independence from Denmark. 

 Born in Denmark, Autogena was acutely aware of the colonial history between Denmark and Greenland. This helped her to address, and mitigate for, levels of mistrust from the Kvanefjeld community. In 2015, she began to capture narratives, stories and testimonials that exposed the conflict between progress and tradition that surrounded the siting of an open\-pit rare earth and uranium mine close to the town of Narsaq. The investigation revealed that the community was particularly vulnerable because of an inability to articulate and platform their fears. 

 Following conversations with Danish experts in nuclear science and history, Autogena visited the Kvanefjeld region to understand and document the relationship between decision\-making, long\-term sustainability, ecological and economic equity, and cultural identity. Over a month in 2016, using documentary film making as an artistic and ethnographic tool, she captured vital visual and oral evidence of the possible environmental and societal impact of uranium mining. The film portrayed a community, struggling to understand the potential risk and consequences to their traditional way of life, divided on the issue of uranium mining. 

 The resulting film, *Kuannersuit; Kvanefjeld* \(2016\) brought together interviews with farmers, residents and politicians to create a video work and an art installation \[ **R3**\].  The issues identified by the film were further contextualised in 2020 by Autogena’s online archive,  [kvanefjeld.net/](http://www.kvanefjeld.net/)  which visualised the layers of complexity of the Kvanefjeld mine in the wider geo\-political context of Greenland \[ **R3**\]. Significantly, the work highlighted the potential impact of cultural taboos in Greenland; major disagreements are avoided rather than confronted and Autogena saw evidence that this has resulted in a democratic vacuum, widespread anxiety and depression. The film documented the failure of government stakeholder consultation in developing an inclusive and informed process, which caused mistrust and suspicion of the underlying agendas. It highlighted the vulnerability of a community with no resources and little scientific literacy. It emphasized that little had been done to communicate factual information about the risks of the planned major mining operation. 

 During 2018, Autogena’s findings led to research, on a European scale, into risk perception and environmental monitoring, with scientists responsible for nuclear safety at The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre \(JRC\). She highlighted a lack of monitoring data from Greenland and identified an opportunity for an EU\-supported community\-owned radiation monitoring strategy for the Kvanefjeld region. To develop this, she used socially engaged and site\-specific methodological approaches developed for Foghorn Requiem \[ **R4**\] \(2013\) and Black Shoals; Dark Matter \[ **R5**\] \(2016\), to establish long\-term relationships with community, government and scientific stakeholders. Community\-based tools for gathering and sharing data, plus data visualisation strategies, were developed to help increase the density of environmental monitoring through community engagement. 

 In 2020, Autogena established Narsaq International Research Station \(NIRS\) in South Greenland. This provided a vehicle for the exploration of how the findings might be translated to other contexts and communities facing similar issues.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research findings have encouraged and enabled democratic stakeholder engagement for an indigenous community. They provided a mechanism for dialogue and highlighted cultural taboos, through the engagement of politicians, government officials, scientists and community members. 

###  Illuminated and confronted the issue of flawed government stakeholder engagement 

 Autogena’s 2016 documentary film, *Kuannersuit; Kvanefjeld* \[ **R3**\], has played an important role in articulating and bringing to attention the concerns of people living in the Kvanefjeld region of Greenland. In so doing it illuminated and confronted the issue of flawed government stakeholder engagement. A member of the Greenland Parliament, and resident of Narsaq, wrote: *“‘Kuannersuit: Kvanefjeld’ has been incredibly important in bringing the potentially disastrous uranium mining at Kvanefjeld to public attention and it has highlighted that the Government has not included the local population in the democratic process*” \[ **E1**\]. In 2020, the former Greenland Government Minister for Industry and Mineral Resources wrote: “ *I showed the film to senior members of my par*ty *last year. We felt that the film was very important in terms of showing the problems that the Kuannersuit mine poses in Greenland right now, and the lack of a democratic conversation we feel is taking place in our society. The problems with the mine are one of the decisive factors in the \[..\] \(parliamentary\) election in Greenland, and we have therefore asked \[Autogena\] if we can post the film on the party's website in connection with the election* \[ **E10**\]. 

###  Highlighted cultural taboos in dealing with conflicts and enabled democratic participation 

 Statements in the documentary such as *“when we disagree, we don’t discuss that subject”* \(14’:44’’\) increased awareness of how, in Greenland, cultural taboos, and silencing of issues of major disagreement, had serious ramifications for the democratic system. This increased awareness has empowered the community to participate in discussions concerning the Kvanefjeld mine. The local Greenland MP wrote *“\[Autogena\] enabled us to become more aware, \[..\], that the right to speak is something we, as citizens in this country, will need to work on if we are to develop our country as we would like.”*  She had also been influenced personally, *“Lise has been incredibly important in making me understand that I have a right to freedom of speech”* and had changed her philosophy *” \[she\] increased my awareness, that we need to change the way we understand \[..\] citizen involvement \[..\] not just now but also in the future. I am now working to make citizens more aware that citizen involvement should be something we take for granted, and not a topic to be fought for” \[ **E1**\].* A farmer, who appeared in the film described how the work gave her a voice. She wrote *""\[..\] it has been difficult to express our feelings about the mine, because for many years our concerns were not listened to. \[..\] I feel that Lise’s film gave me a voice that I didn’t have before""* \[ **E4**\] \(2020\). 

 **The research has stimulated public debate**. In 2018, Autogena presented her research at a public hearing at the University of Greenland, followed by a panel discussion. Autogena’s pre\-publicity highlighted urgent questions and issues identified by the research, such as “ *How can a democratic conversation take place, when the political desire \[stands\] in contrast to the desire of a large part of the population \[..\]?”* Although announced only five days in advance, 155 people expressed interest in the event. Attendees included six MPs, the PM’s personal secretary, the head of the opposition party and the Minister for Mineral Resources, plus representatives from two government agencies, the Chairman of Tanbreez Mining, heads of Human Rights Council and Red Cross, academics, members of the public and anti\-mining activists. An associate professor at the university commented *“The event’s turnout was unusually outstanding”* \[ **E3**\]. 

 The official responsible for stakeholder engagement for the Environmental Agency for Mineral Resource Activities \(EAMRA\) wrote that she *“prioritized showing up \[despite\] another appointment”.* She added *“Many \[people\] were asking for more factual information \[..\] and finally a new documentary was launched \[..\]* and *there was going to be a debate between the audience and a panel”*. The presentation *, “strengthened my understanding that we must develop our citizen involvement in Greenland. \[It\] asked many questions \[..\] that have not yet been properly addressed, either by the government, research\-wise or by a wider population group”* \[ **E2**\] \(2020\). 

###  Provided a route to greater awareness of the risks of uranium mining and to the democratisation of radiation monitoring 

 In 2018, Autogena was commissioned to work as an artist with the EU science policy unit, JRC, which monitors background radiation data in Europe. Realising that the EU did not receive any data from Greenland, Autogena and the curator of Nuclear Culture at Bildmuseet, proposed an artist\-led collaboration to enable the community in the Kvanefjeld region to take ownership of monitoring the impact of uranium mining. By democratising data collection and submitting data directly to the EU and the Danish Emergency Management Agency monitoring systems the community would have an early warning system for any increases in radiation and develop enhanced localised scientific knowledge. The resulting Kvanefjeld Community Radiation Monitoring strategy represented a shift from the centralized environmental\-evidence model to a distributed community\-based approach. It was a major conceptual change that was supported by the environmental consultants for the Government \(EAMRA\). They became collaborators in the project and on their recommendation, Autogena was invited to present her strategy to the Greenland Government. 

 Later, the government official responsible for stakeholder engagement in mining projects, acknowledged that the consultation process was flawed. She was inspired to leave her job to focus on Autogena’s idea. She noted, “I felt there was an urgent need to carry out this alternative project **.** *In short, this \[Autogena’s\] alternative proposal\- combined with how the Greenland Mineral Agency, the ministry of Raw Materials and the Environment handled the stakeholder consultation process in allowing mining projects\-made me decide to get actively involved in the consultation process as an ordinary citizen\-it also motivated my interest in starting to research how we Greenlanders can develop the democratic conversation \[..\] between foreign mining companies \[..\], the government \[..\] and \[..\] citizens”* \[ **E2**\] \(2020\). She now works with Autogena. 

 Using methodologies developed for her large\-scale art collaborations, \[ **R4**, **R5**\] Autogena involved stakeholders \(including local residents, sheep farmers, activists, schools, health experts, EU scientists and government consultants\) in developing an inclusive and informed approach to community\-based environmental monitoring. One sheep farmer wrote that they had encouraged other farmers to support the initiative *“because it will give us an early\-warning system \[..\]. Our school is part in this \[so the children can\] learn that we all have to take care of the nature that we live in together""* \[ **E4**\] \(2020\). 

 In 2020, Autogena established the Narsaq International Research Station \(NIRS\), which hosts research projects in dialogue with residents, education, museums, and community centres in the region. The initiative was widely endorsed. The Director of Kunsthal Aarhus in Denmark noted that the NIRS “ *applies important artistic research to everyday problems*” and for that reason in 2020 “ *decided to become a board member of NIRS\-in my \[professional\] role \[and\] also as an individual citizen”.* \[ **E5**\]. Researchers and academics, from disciplines including art, political science and anthropology have asked to collaborate with NIRS \[ **E6**\]. The former Government Minister for Industry and Mineral Resources remarked that the NIRS *“is of great importance to Narsaq \[..\] because it is the local community that helps define which research takes place \[..\]. It is a whole new way of launching research”* \[ **E10**\]. A radiation expert who worked as consultant for the Greenland Government wrote: *“For decades, worldwide scientists have traveled to Greenland to study Kvanefjeld. However, their work has never been presented to the local community in a language they can understand. The Research Station has made this possible”* \[ **E6**\]. 

###  Enabled collaboration between indigenous communities 

 The research created links between activists, scientists and artists of the indigenous populations of Greenland and the Navajo in the US. It led to a sharing of experience and learning and increased understanding of the complex issues contextualising uranium mining and traditional land use. In 2018 the International Nuclear Film Festival invited Autogena to present her research at Navajo Nation, US Indian Reservation, in locations blighted by uranium mining. After she delivered a message of shared concern from a Kvanefjeld resident to Navajo politicians, environmental activists and communities, the festival director wrote, *“I felt a great spirit of solidarity in the indigenous audience with their counterparts in Greenland”* \[ **E7**\]. A Navajo film festival organiser and influential member of her community added, *“After the presentation \[we decided\] to travel to Greenland to present our experiences to the Greenland parliament”* \[ **E7**\]. A Navajo scientist wrote, *""\[we\] started planning a Navajo/Greenlandic knowledge exchange on community monitoring of radiation from mining sites, I am now in contact with a sheep farmer in Greenland who will be coordinating my \[visit\] to Greenland""* \[ **E7**\] \(2020\). The Covid\-19 pandemic has so far prevented the trips from taking place. 

###  Created new reference points in the domain of contemporary art discourse 

 The documentary demonstrated that an arts\-based methodology can enable dialogue, expose difficult truths and galvanise action. The film has been viewed online more than 3,300 times since 2017 and was a fundamental part of a major exhibition series. The film installation was exhibited continually between 2017 and 2020 in 13 high profile exhibitions, curated by established curators at major international museums and art venues, including Critical Zones, Observatories for Earthly Politics \(curated by Bruno Latour\) at ZKM, Germany \(2020 ongoing\), and the major touring exhibition \(Perpetual Uncertainty / Contemporary Art in the Nuclear Anthropocene\), including exhibitions in Norway \(exhibition voted Critics Choice in 2019\), Denmark, Holland, UK, Spain, Belgium and Lithuania. Total visitor numbers exceeded 230,000 \[ **R3**, **E9**\]. 

 Curator of the Aarhus Kunsthal wrote that the work *“represents a significant new research approach that builds entirely new infrastructures”* \[ **E5**\]. In 2020, the curator of three exhibitions, Bildmuseet, Malmo Kunsthal and Contemporary Art Centre Vilnius, wrote *, “Historically artists usually respond to the nuclear industry after the event: after a mine has closed or after a nuclear accident. \[..\] Autogena and Portway have taken an original approach to working with a community before a nuclear event. The artists methodology is pre\-emptive \[..\]”* \[ **E5**\] *.* 

 The work has increased understanding of the issues from outside of the arts world. A 2019 essay by an economist on the website of Polar Connection \(a UK\-based Polar Think Tank\) said *, “This piece displaying ore and imagery \[..\] sums up the trade\-offs facing Greenland’s future in mining with stark brilliance”* \[ **E8**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted by Professor Stephen Halloran into the Faecal Immunochemical Test \(FIT\), including a pilot of FIT within the national bowel cancer screening programme \(NHS BCSP\), was instrumental in the UK National Screening Committee’s recommendation for the UK\-wide adoption of FIT as the primary test for bowel cancer screening replacing the previously used guaiac\-based Faecal Occult Blood Test \(gFOBT\). The introduction of FIT has influenced healthcare policy in Scotland, Wales and England, with updates to NICE Guidelines made in 2017 and is expected to contribute savings compared with gFOBT of £26m per year. Since its introduction, FIT has increased Bowel Cancer Screening uptake by up to 10%, particularly for previous non\-responders and first\-timers, as well as hard to reach groups. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Colorectal cancer \(CRC\) is the second highest cause of cancer deaths in developed countries \(1.8 million cases, 896,000 deaths worldwide, 2017\). The aim of population\-based screening for bowel cancer is to reduce incidence and mortality through prevention by the removal of adenomas and earlier diagnosis. The National Health Service Bowel Cancer Screening Programme \(NHS BCSP\) utilising the guaiac\-based Faecal Occult Blood Test \(gFOBT\) was rolled out in the UK in 2006. 

 In 2012, a study by Professor Halloran \(in collaboration with the University of Sheffield\) was undertaken on behalf of the NHS Cancer Screening Programme to inform future bowel cancer screening policy in England. This work concluded that comprehensive screening data would improve understanding of the disease and allow identification of optimal screening modalities **\[R1\]**. At that time, uptake for gFOBT was lower than for other cancer screening programmes due to the multiple faecal samples required. Professor Halloran \(in collaboration with University College London\) also identified that socio\-economic deprivation was consistently associated with lower gFOBT uptake **\[R2\]** therefore a test involving a simpler single sample approach was needed to help improve uptake overall and within these harder to reach groups. 

 The Faecal Immunochemical Test \(FIT\) specifically recognises human haemoglobin \(Hb\) in faeces and thus the presence of bleeding bowel cancers and pre\-cancerous polyps. Unlike gFOBT, FIT results are not influenced by the presence of other blood in stools \(e.g., animal blood ingested through diet\) or drugs that have oxidising or reducing properties. FIT therefore reduces the chance of false positives. In addition, FIT detects human blood at much lower concentrations, analysis is automated and only requires a single faecal sample \(compared to the 6 samples required for gFOBT\). FIT also provides a quantitative result facilitating the setting of appropriate thresholds to support optimal use of ‘post\-test’ investigation resources. 

 In 2012, to further develop the evidence\-base for the potential introduction of FIT in the UK, Professor Halloran led a study undertaken by the Guildford Medical Device Evaluation Centre \(GMEC\) based at the University of Surrey. This work evaluated four quantitative FIT products **\[R3\]** generating essential data on the pros and cons of the potential testing products that would be needed for rollout of FIT screening services. The evaluation also investigated standardisation issues including sample stability, sample mass, traceability and cross reactivity. 

 In 2014, Professors Halloran and Moss \(Queen Mary University, London\) led a large comparative study of FIT and gFOBT within the existing NHS BCSP at two Screening Hubs \(Southern; Midlands & North West\). Over a 6\-month period, 40,930 \(1 in 28\) participants were sent a FIT instead of a gFOBT. Overall uptake was 66.4% for FIT compared with 59.3% for gFOBT, a <ins>greater increase than had been achieved previously in any established screening programme</ins>.  Importantly, <ins>uptake by previous non\-responders almost doubled</ins> \(FIT 23.9% vs gFOBt 12.5%\) and <ins>an increase was observed across all deprivation quintiles</ins> with a 7.8 percentage point increase in the most deprived quintile \(FIT 54.3% vs 46.5% gFOBT\). Furthermore, and most critically, <ins>with FIT cancer detection increased two</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>fold and advanced adenoma detection nearly five</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>fold</ins> **\[R4\]**. 

 Professor Halloran collaborated with Health Economists from University of Oxford to explore the cost\-effectiveness of FIT at a range of positivity thresholds. It produced the first published economic analysis of FIT screening in England using data directly comparing FIT with gFOBT. Results for a cohort starting screening aged 60 years demonstrated that FIT is highly cost\-effective at all thresholds, results in quality\-adjusted life years \(QALYs\) gains compared to gFOBT and that a population screened with FIT would result in a total estimated cost saving of £26 million per year compared with gFOBT **\[R5\]**. In a further study involving Professor Halloran \(funded by the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care\), it was demonstrated that including routinely available risk predictors in the screening algorithm alongside FIT improves both the risk prediction model performance and test accuracy **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 On the 19th November 2015, as a direct result of the outcomes of the 2014 study conducted by Professor Halloran, University of Surrey **\[R4\]**, the UK National Screening Committee \(UK NSC\) recommended the adoption of FIT within the NHS Bowel Screening Programme as the primary test for bowel cancer **\[S1\]**. Following this recommendation, on the 7th June 2016 the Department of Health issued their media statement “ **New bowel screening test to save hundreds of lives**” announcing that FIT would replace the current gFOBT used in the NHS Bowel Screening Programmes in England, Scotland and Wales **\[S2\]**. Public Health Minister, Jane Ellison, stated “ **This new test is an exciting game changer for helping us beat bowel cancer. It is easier to use, will increase the number of tests and help us tackle cancer earlier**”. 

 In July 2017, NICE issued their guidance on the use of FIT testing for patients with low\-risk symptoms **\[S3\]**. Subsequent work commissioned by the UK National Screening Committee \(NSC\) to consider the cost\-effectiveness of a variety of different screening options and thresholds and directly citing Professor Halloran’s research outcomes **\[R1, R2, R4, R5\]** concluded in September 2017 that a FIT strategy is indeed more effective and less expensive than gFOBT **\[S4\]**. The roll out of FIT commenced in Scotland on 20th November 2017, Wales on 28th January 2019 and England in June 2019. 

 In Scotland, latest figures show, that following the introduction of FIT, the uptake of bowel cancer screening had already increased from 55.9% \(2016/17\) to 63.9% \(2017/18\). Moreover, the largest improvement in participation has been amongst those living in the most deprived areas \(42.0% to 51.8%\) where survival outcomes are often poorer. The number of men participating increased by more than 9 percentage points \(52.6% to 61.8%\) and there was an even greater increase in uptake \(8.2% to 18.4%\) amongst those who had never participated before, but previously had the opportunity to **\[S5\]**. 

 Wales began their phased introduction of FIT on 28th January 2019 with 1 in 28 random screening participants issued with FIT, mirroring the approach used in Professor Halloran’s research **\[R4\]**. Although it is too early for a full statistical analysis to be reported regarding the effect, the most recent data available from Public Health Wales Screening Division \(for the year 2018/19\) has already shown performance improvements compared to gFOBT. For example, the percentage of spoilt or rejected tests appears lower with FIT \(0.0%/0.2% FIT vs 1.1%/2.3% gFOBT\) **\[S6\]**. 

 Prior to the Welsh roll\-out, and in support of it, in December 2018 Cancer Research UK \(CRUK\) issued their “Engaging Primary Care in bowel screening GP good practice guide for Wales” **\[S7\]**; this cites Professor Halloran’s research **\[R4\]** as the primary underpinning evidence for the replacement of gFOBT with a FIT screening pathway. They reinforced the replacement of gFOBt by FIT in their Insights Brochure for GPs \(Insights Brochures are CRUK’s expert guides on prevention and early diagnosis of cancer for health professionals\) **\[S8\]** again citing the University of Surrey’s crucial work **\[R4\]** showing superior uptake associated with FIT. Further, it states that “ **The switch to FIT provides a great opportunity to raise screening with your patients**” and through achieving diagnosis “ **at the earliest stage \[ensure\] more than 9 in 10 people will survive bowel cancer for more than 5 years**” \[S8\]. 

 In summary, as a direct result of research conducted by Professor Halloran at the University of Surrey, national bowel cancer screening policy has changed to include the adoption of FIT as the primary screening test used in the NHS BCSP. Moreover, since its recent introduction, utilisation of FIT is radically increasing bowel cancer screening uptake across England, Scotland and Wales and is clearly already reducing inequalities in screening rates across Scotland. Given that early diagnosis is the most effective route to reducing deaths from colorectal cancer, this change in screening technology will directly contribute to lives saved.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Armitt, Brewster and Jones on Gothic storytelling and performance has had a significant impact on members of the public and new student audiences, fostering an improved understanding of the role Gothic continues to play in shaping our sense of place, community and the environment, including in the tourism and leisure industries. The research, whose impact has regional and national and generational reach, has increased cultural participation, improved awareness and changed the way in which the general public, older readers \(60\+\), GSCE and A\-Level students understand the resonance and relevance of Gothic in the twenty\-first century. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Armitt, Brewster and Jones’s research demonstrates that society’s ongoing fascination with Gothic narratives and ghost stories in literature, film and theatre, the tourist and leisure industries and in scientific discourse derives from their unique potential to provide narrative shape to otherwise formless but preoccupying fears/anxieties surrounding our shifting relationships to geography, community and belonging. 

 Armitt was the twentieth\-century specialist in a national six\-member team of academic researchers working with the British Library on its major exhibition ‘Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination’ \(October 2014 \- January 2015\). Armitt wrote a 10,000\-word essay, ‘Twentieth\-Century Gothic’, for the accompanying catalogue **\[3.1\]**, in which she explores how, ‘in the active pursuit of what most frightens us, we continually reshape our Gothic monsters to fit society’s changing fears’ \(150\). This work prompted the wider research question of this Case Study: to what extent does the Gothic continue to play a role in the wider management of cultural anxiety and remain *the* literature of terror? 

 Armitt’s recent work on M.R. James’s ghost stories and coastal erosion **\[3.2\]** breaks new critical ground by exploring the preponderance of Gothic metaphors used to ‘manage’ prevailing socio\-cultural anxieties relating to storm surges and climate change. Her research on ghost stories of the North Sea coastline uncovers inter\-disciplinary connections between folklore narratives of uncanny coastal predators, the historic findings of a Royal Commission and research by climate change scientists on storm surges and coastal erosion. She demonstrates that storytelling inhabits a role of equal shaping significance to those scientific narratives which measure, quantify and analyze shifting coastal and tidal patterns in these specified locales. In the process, the regionally\-based ghost story is re\-framed as a foundational discourse working alongside scientific methods, demonstrating how Gothic storytelling provides new ways of understanding the relationship between cultural anxiety and place. 

  

 Brewster’s research presents the Gothic, and the ghost story, as exploiting *and* managing concerns about place and cultural identity. He reveals how these concerns are confronted through the blending of literary and popular narratives about community and locale, as in the work of James Hogg **\[3.3\]**. Brewster has also provided new insights into the cultural importance of the ghost story, and the central role it plays in shaping relationships to place and history within different regional, national and international contexts. His co\-edited essay collection, *The Routledge Handbook to the Ghost Story* \(to which Armitt and Jones also contribute essays\), is the first comprehensive study of the different conceptions of the supernatural tale, and the social and cultural roles played by ghosts, across the world and significantly extends understanding of the ghost story tradition in the British Isles, continental Europe, the Americas, South Africa, India, South\-East Asia and Australasia **\[3.4\]**. Brewster’s individual contribution is a 5,000\-word chapter on ‘Ghost Walks’, which establishes a novel appreciation of the links between literary ghost narratives and contemporary tourism. 

 Jones’s work on contemporary Gothic drama, particularly the co\-edited collection *Contemporary Gothic Drama: Attraction, Consummation and Consumption on the Modern British Stage* **\[3.5\]** and her essay on Frankenstein, adaptation and live theatre **\[3.6\]** has brought new critical attention to the continuing theatrical currency of the Gothic, highlighting the ambivalent appeal of the public performance, and embodiment, of fear among diverse audiences. Jones’s individual contribution to her essay collection, a 9600\-word chapter on Gothic Children and Contemporary Theatrical Performance, identifies new ways of presenting young protagonists in recent stage productions.

###  3. References to the research \(indicative maximum of six references\) 

 All of the research outputs listed here were subject to rigorous peer review by the subject community. Academic reviews have endorsed the rigour, significance and originality of the research. Armitt’s chapter in *Terror and Wonder* was praised by *Romantic Textualities* for doing ‘an admirable job of contextualising and expanding’ upon its stage of the British Library exhibition. Reviewing Brewster’s *Routledge Handbook to the Ghost Story* for the Supernatural Studies Association, Aran Ruth commented that the book was ‘a welcome collection of interpretive and theoretical explorations on the topic’ and an ‘excellent’ introduction to the field. Brewster’s chapter on James Hogg was described by the *Irish Journal of Gothic and Horror Studies* as a ‘vigorous’ case study, while *The Bottle Imp* viewed it as a ‘valuable, and necessary’ contribution to scholarship.  In *Gothic Studies*, Carly Hunter calls Jones’s *Contemporary Gothic Drama* a ‘fascinating collection’, recommending it ‘to anyone seeking to learn about the Gothic's potential on and off stage’.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Armitt, Brewster and Jones’s research has led to wider public understanding of Gothic’s role in charting and navigating contemporary climates of fear. Since January 2014, this research has changed understanding in audiences, including \(a\) schoolchildren and \(b\) older readers and the general public, and brought economic and reputational benefit to organizations and businesses nationally and regionally. 

  

 **Improved understanding and awareness of Gothic for schoolchildren.** 

 **a.** **The researchers designed and delivered events and learning materials for schoolchildren, enriching their understanding of the role and importance of Gothic today.** In April 2019 Armitt was invited to write and record for the platform Massolit six online ‘mini\-lectures’ on Sarah Waters’s *The Little Stranger* for sixth\-form students \( [https://www.massolit.io/subjects/english\-literature/contemporary\-literature](https://www.massolit.io/subjects/english-literature/contemporary-literature)<ins>\)</ins>. Massolit’s founder, Chris Tudor, commented \(June 2020\) that ‘more than 3,000 schools from around the world have used our site on a free trial basis’. He confirmed that Armitt’s course ‘has had 5,667 views since it was added to the site’, and within a month of being uploaded on 10 December 2019, her viewing numbers were ‘in the top 20 per cent of all videos on the site’ **\[5.1\]** 

 Armitt, Brewster and Jones ran several events, with storytelling and the confrontation of fear at their heart, that engaged schoolchildren with Lincoln’s Gothic research. Armitt and Jones \(with PGR student Bryan\) organized a public conference, ‘Frankenstein at 200’, at the Lincoln Drill Hall on 31 October 2018, featuring public\-facing papers, a roundtable discussion with audience participation and a student\-led performance derived from Jones’s research. 50\+ people attended, including a school group from Kesteven and Sleaford High School. Unsolicited comments in The School’s Newsletter reported that the event ‘really enhanced our understanding of some of the themes and characters in Shelley’s text’, ‘was incredibly informative’ and ‘helped us broaden our knowledge contextually’ **\[5.2\]**. 

 Brewster engaged schoolchildren at the Lincoln Book Festival 2017 with a Gothic Fiction masterclass on *Frankenstein* and *Wuthering Heights* for 30 GSCE and A\-Level students and a Gothic\-themed Flash Fiction competition \(organized by Cherrell, PGR\), attracting 300\+ entries, many from primary and secondary schoolchildren. Festival Chair, Phil Hamlyn Williams, commented that the competition achieved ‘the objective of engaging a wider cross section of people in the festival…with excellent entries from Primary School and Secondary School students’ **\[5.3\]**. 

 b. **Engaging new audiences with, and changing understanding of, the Gothic.** 

 In December 2014, Armitt and Brewster gave an invited public lecture on ‘Gothic Travel and Tourism’ as part of a BL Gothic Public Study Day, linked to the ‘Terror and Wonder’ exhibition, attended by 150 people. The ‘Open Graves, Open Minds’ website said of it that ‘\[t\]heir research project on Gothic tourism struck a chord and was very topical’.  The exhibition brought economic benefit to the BL, attracting 64,460 visitors during its four\-month run, which BL noted ‘was considered a success…because we attracted a younger demographic and many first\-time visitors on that occasion’ **\[5.4\]**. The accompanying essay collection containing Armitt’s chapter on twentieth\-century Gothic sold 4,000 copies. Reviewing the collection, **London Visitors**, the official blog for Visiting London Guide.com, commented that Armitt’s chapter ‘ **offers the clearest explanation of \[Gothic’s\] appeal’** \[5.4\].** 

 Complementing the engagement with schoolchildren, Brewster’s research into the ghost story’s enduring, cross\-generational appeal underpinned a session of the Lincoln Older Readers’ Twenty\-First\-Century Literature Book Group \(with PGR student, Bevan, June 2017\) discussing Susan Hill’s *The Travelling Bag.* Participants reflected that **‘** *this was the first collection of ghost stories I have read for many years’* and ‘ *I haven’t read ghost stories since my teens’.* They observed that the session ‘ *opened my eyes to the modern relevance of ghost stories’, ‘made me think about revisiting the genre’* and *‘made me interested in finding out more about contemporary versions of ghost stories’* **\[5.5\]**. 

 Brewster’s invitation to advise on the ‘Go Gothic’ Lincoln Book Festival in September 2017 further developed audiences’ understanding of the contemporary importance of Gothic storytelling. Beforehand, Brewster was interviewed by Siren Radio about Gothic’s popularity and continuing power \(17 August 2017, 70 downloads\). During the Festival, his interview with novelist Diane Setterfield, held at The Collection, attracted 60 people. The Festival Chair acknowledged the importance of Brewster’s research to the success of the event: ‘Diane is an acclaimed Gothic author and it deepened the audience experience to have you interviewing her with the benefit of your research’ **\[5.3\]**. 

 As a result of his research on popular ghost narratives, Brewster hosted ‘A Lincoln Ghost Story’ at the White Hart Hotel on 27 November 2017, broadening appreciation of why ghost stories still matter in the twenty\-first century. The evening included talks by Brewster and the Lincoln Ghost Walk guide, and readings by Jones. It attracted a sell\-out audience of 120, resulted in extra sales of £500 for the venue and brought new customers to the alternative Lincoln Ghost Walk. One audience member observed: ‘It’s certainly made me want to learn more about ghost stories and made me question the moral teachings and reasonings behind them’.  Others acknowledged new understanding of the ghost story’s connection with Christmas \(highlighted in Brewster’s contribution\): ‘I never considered the relation to Christmas to stretch as far back as Shakespeare’ **\[5.6\]** 

 In November 2019, Brewster and Jones hosted two evenings of ‘Haunted’, featuring a talk by Brewster and performances of ghost stories, some directed by Jones, as part of the AHRC/ BA Being Human Festival hub at University of Lincoln. These events, at St Mary’s Guildhall and Lincoln Performing Arts Centre, incorporated audience participation and attracted capacity audiences \(90 in total\). Responses included: ‘It was interesting to think about how the ways in which we tell stories impacts upon our perception of them. I hadn’t thought about that before’. Other respondents learned from ‘seeing research in a theatrical setting’, reported ‘renewed interest in Gothic literature’, expressing a changed understanding and appreciation of Lincolnshire ghost tales, encouraging them to ‘look out for more’. Cate Waby, Manager/ Secretary of St Mary’s Guildhall, observed that the event ‘enabled us to open up the building to the general public and the wider community’ and helped with ‘new bookings and events’ **\[5.7\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor D’Costa’s research into Catholic doctrines regarding other religions has challenged fifty years of majority interpretations of the Vatican Council, leading members of the clergy and laity worldwide to reconsider their approach to the religious ‘other’. The research has led to policy and curriculum changes in Bristol’s Roman Catholic Clifton Diocese, and has set national standards for interfaith relations through the launch, in 2015, of the Clifton Diocese annual Catholic\-Jewish\-Muslim trialogue. His research into wider Christian approaches to religious pluralism was incorporated into the OCR A\-Level syllabus, reaching approximately 50,000 students since 2014, and transforming their understanding of traditional approaches to religious pluralism. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 From 2009 to 2018, University of Bristol researcher Professor Gavin D’Costa examined Christian attitudes to other religions via two main research streams: \(A\) Roman Catholic rationale for interfaith relations and its goals; and \(B\) theological and philosophical presuppositions within Christian approaches to the religious ‘other’. While the streams are closely linked, the principal beneficiaries of D’Costa’s research are \(A\) church groups and \(B\) the A\-level curriculum. 

###  A: Roman Catholic doctrinal teachings regarding other religions 

 D’Costa has examined Roman Catholic formal doctrinal teachings regarding Jews and Muslims found in the Second Vatican Council documents \(‘Vatican II’, 1963\-65\) **\[3.1\]** and subsequent official teachings **\[3.2\]**. Historically, Catholics have had mainly negative attitudes towards Jews and Muslims. The new teachings of the Council radically challenge these negative attitudes. The research shows these new attitudes do not entail changing underlying doctrine but a development in understanding and application of these doctrines. Many Catholics falsely understand the Council to teach the equality of religions and to have abandoned traditional doctrines. The research shows how the Church’s teachings hold together traditional doctrines with a remarkably open and positive attitude to the ‘other’ – both in terms of salvation and in the positive value of their religious tradition. Thus, the research challenges fifty years of interpreting the Council. The research also shows that Judaism and Islam pose profound challenges to past Catholic practices and theological attitudes – in differing ways. The Catholic Church now teaches that all three religions worship the same God, all have a connection to Abraham, and all have shared ethical values. D’Costa’s research asserts that these commonalities, despite serious doctrinal differences, can guide interfaith dialogue to explore each other’s teachings and spirituality, and encourage working together for the common good. 

###  B: Wider Christian approaches to religious pluralism 

 Within this stream, D’Costa examined twentieth\-century Christian approaches towards other religions **\[3.3\]**. Unlike stream A, this research is not Catholic specific. The research develops three points that have been important for wider debate in the field. 

 First, it has shown that while some influential modern liberal Christian approaches are commendable in seeking to welcome and affirm religious plurality, the underlying philosophical relativism in these positions is problematic. This relativism has strategically sought to minimise conflicting truth claims. The research shows that the religions in question are not taken seriously when this happens, thereby undermining genuine interfaith dialogue. 

 Second, the research has related this theological strategy to the way some modern liberal societies and theoreticians deal with religious pluralism by only accepting religious discourse when it conforms to the canons of secular discourse. While this strategy is well meaning and intended to encourage debate in a pluralist society, it has the unintended consequence of refusing religious discourse a public platform. 

 Third, the research has shown how faith and reason within more traditional Christian approaches can provide both positive theological and social approaches to religious plurality. There is a role for Christianity in the public square, especially in seeking the common good with those from any religion or no religion. The impact of these ideas upon schoolteachers and children is traced in this study. It has helped to challenge commonly held views in our culture in a constructive and positive manner.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###  A: Shaped Catholic Policy and Teaching on Interfaith Matters – in the Clifton Diocese and Internationally 

 **Clifton \(Bristol\) Diocese**Since 2012, Professor D’Costa has acted as special advisor to the Bishop of Clifton and the Clifton Diocese Adult Education Director on interfaith matters. The diocese consists of 107 parishes and a population of roughly 200,000 Catholics \(2013 figures\). During this REF period, D’Costa’s advice and input have helped shape and create an agenda that the Diocese has adopted and developed in its practices **\[5.1\]**. 

 The Diocese Adult Education Director is charged with training priests, deacons, and lay catechists. Since 2013, D’Costa’s research **\[3.1, 3.2\]** and expertise has shaped the curriculum for these training programmes **\[5.1\]**. For example, the doctrinal, not just pastoral developments are highlighted. Training attendees in 2019 noted the impact on their practice: ‘Being able to apply Church teachings to present\-day concerns in ways that are accessible but are rooted in the history, tradition and theology of the Church’; and their transformed attitudes: ‘to build bridges’ **\[5.3\]**. The Director notes that this training is ‘seminal in transforming local parish life across the diocese, helping Catholics to be open and discerning about Jewish and Muslim communities … and their religious significance’ **\[5.1\]**. 

 D’Costa has further advanced the teachings of the Catholic Church regarding Jews and Muslims by developing a new diocese policy, since 2015, of holding an annual interfaith trialogue with Catholic\-Jewish\-Muslim speakers during the UK’s Inter Faith Week. This has established Clifton Diocese as a model of good practice in interfaith relations, as recognised at the national level by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales **\[5.2\]**. The Clifton Diocese Adult Education Director states: ‘\[ *the annual programme*\] is ground\-breaking in our diocese, and also nationally\[…\] Bristol is now one of the beacon\-dioceses for developing and encouraging constructive interfaith meetings within a Catholic perspective’ **\[5.1\]**. These interfaith meetings have involved about 400 people over the REF period. Laity and members of the clergy in Clifton report their attitudes towards Catholicism and Jews and Muslims have been challenged **\[5.3\]**. 

 From 2019, this trialogue programme has been extended to include diocese sixth formers and their teachers in a half\-day event. The student attendees reported very positively: they had not understood the Catholic Church’s approach and found it deeply challenging and helpful and were also keen to engage further **\[5.6\]**. In the evening of the same day, the same panel engaged at Clifton Cathedral with a lay, clergy, and ecumenical audience. This will now take place annually and establishes a model of good practice for English Catholicism. The Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales has agreed to house the video of the evening event to share with other dioceses nationally and internationally **\[5.2\]**. 

 **International reach** 

 D’Costa’s research on ‘Vatican II’ **\[3.1\]** has had a significant impact on Catholic clergy and laity internationally. During this REF period, he has presented his research in Catholic dioceses and universities in Jerusalem, the US \(three conferences\), Ireland, Germany, Rome and Hungary, reaching over 500 people. Many attendees of these events reported that through this engagement they have come to appreciate better the Catholic Church’s orthodoxy and its radical openness towards Jews and Muslims. The research has helped dispel negative and indifferent attitudes towards the ‘other’ and question any easy assimilation or equalisation. Many have discovered areas of social teaching and spirituality where the three faiths share common insights \(for example: regarding prayer, attitudes to mercy and charity, regarding Israel/Palestine, and the role of women\) **\[5.5\]**. 

 A deacon who attended the Rome event in 2019 reported ‘I will be ordained as a priest soon, and having a better understanding of a theology of Judaism will inform my preaching as well as any inter\-religious work I take up’, while another said D’Costa’s research gave them ‘ideas on how to cooperate in dialogue with the Jewish people and their religious heritage, which impulses me to reflect on different initiatives when I go back to Chile’ **\[5.5\]**. An attendee of the Dublin event in 2019 stated that D’Costa’s ‘work has inspired me to think anew about our Catholic engagement with Jewish scholars as opportunities for mutual enrichment and spiritual edification **’ \[5.4\]**. 

 Some report they have sought further interfaith education and pastoral experience and actively create such opportunities through their parish. For example **\[5.3\]**, one priest has since hosted a joint Holocaust Remembrance Day with the local Jewish community and shared Eid celebrations with the local Muslim community. 

 Additionally, D’Costa’s 2020 monograph **\[3.2\]** has been selected for a panel discussion at the annual meeting of the Society for Post\-Supersessionist Theology in November 2020 **\[5.10\]**; is being translated into Hungarian, Polish and Italian; and will be the subject of an international conference in Rome, 2021, at the Angelicum Pontifical University, and half\-day events in Hungary \(Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Budapest\) and Poland \(the Pontifical University of John Paul II, Kraków\) for Catholic clergy and laity in 2022. 

###  B: Research adopted in A\-level syllabus, transforming students and teachers’ understanding of religious pluralism 

 The OCR A\-level Syllabus is part of the Cambridge Assessment Group, Europe’s largest assessment agency. OCR plays a leading role in developing and delivering assessments throughout the world, operating in over 150 countries. 13,000 centres internationally choose OCR A\-levels. 

 The Chief Examiner of the OCR Board included D’Costa’s research **\[3.3\]** in the new syllabus for A\-level Religious Studies, published in 2014, on the basis that it requires students to critically examine often held common prejudices **\[5.7\]**. D’Costa is discussed in the Chief Examiner's textbook, *OCR Religious Studies for A Level Year 2* \(2017\), which sold 4,000 copies by 2019. The Chief Examiner reports: ‘students think more deeply as a result of \[D’Costa’s\] research’, adding that they take this learning and apply it more widely outside their A\-level studies when reflecting on debate in the public square **\[5.7\]**. Attendees of teacher events held over 2018\-2020, including the Teachers Conference, corroborated this: 

-  ‘I am going to approach this differently – emphasising the criticisms of other approaches as well as the strengths.’ 

-  ‘As ecumenical representative in my parish, I am encouraged in finding common ground with other faiths, particularly on addressing poverty and climate change.’ 

-  ‘We watched some YouTube clips of his teaching, which \[ *the students*\] engaged with enthusiastically, and they were intrigued, and surprised, to read about his ideas on ‘controlling beliefs’. They found this concept easy\-to\-access, and helpful in their overall studies.’ **\[5.9\]** 

 D’Costa’s research is also discussed in the other widely\-used resource book for the syllabus: Libby Ahluwalia and Robert Bowie, *Oxford A\-level Religious Studies for OCR* \(2016\). 

 In total, during this REF period, about 50,000 students have engaged with D’Costa’s research, as approximately 8,000 students take the OCR Religious Studies A\-level each year. The syllabus is employed in both faith based and secular schools. 

 Students report that it has challenged their attraction to ‘liberal’ Christian approaches, which they had previously favoured, sometimes causing them to neglect ‘traditional’ alternatives. D’Costa’s research **\[3.3\]** helped them realise the difficulties with the possible unacknowledged relativism related to such approaches. One student reported: ‘\[D’Costa’s\] writings have affected how I perceive others’ faiths in that they have reminded me not to take an imperialist viewpoint’ **\[5.8\]**. Students also reported a more sympathetic approach to traditional/orthodox Christian sources, which they had not appreciated previously, and which were more resourceful than they had imagined in understanding religious plurality positively. A number claimed that this field had become important and challenging to them, and some consider studying it further **\[5.8\]**. One student said: ‘I have become aware of the fact that the threefold typology alone is problematic as pluralism is potentially also a form of exclusivism as it’s secular and reflective of modernity’ **\[5.8\]**. A teacher reported: ‘it helped the students understand the syllabus better, both in terms of the issues Christianity faces in a pluralist society, and also with the Christian response to Judaism’ **\[5.9\]**. 

 Teachers report that they have used the research to challenge students in common prejudices and to view the field differently. One teacher said: ‘it has helped me to look at the subject matter in a more critical way’ **\[5.9\]**. Most importantly, several teachers reported that it challenged their own assumptions and changed their teaching approaches in this area, for example: ‘I felt inspired to review my own teaching notes and consider issues in a more contemporary light’ **\[5.9\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The research team at NTU has developed an innovative co\-simulation tool, coupling an energy system model built on the Dymola\-Modelica and EnergyPlus model of buildings, which evaluates and optimises retrofit solutions for existing homes. The team also pioneered a new low temperature district heating solution, in collaboration with Nottingham City Homes. The research has been applied during the retrofit of 463 homes and has achieved real world impact in multiple aspects: \(1\) enabling Nottingham City Council to access £26m in EU and UK Government funding and establish the city as a world leader in sustainable urban regeneration; \(2\) improving the living conditions of a large group of vulnerable residents and reducing their fuel costs by up to 73%; \(3\) influencing housing policy of local authorities; and \(4\) contributing to the broad national debate on retrofit of existing housing. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Existing homes will account for 80% of the total housing stock in 2050 and most of them have an energy performance rating of Band C or worse. Large scale retrofit of existing housing is needed to achieve the UK’s carbon reduction goal of the 2008 Climate Change Act. Despite numerous successful pilot retrofit programs, there are still significant technical, economic, and social barriers for scaling\-up retrofits. Professor Ianakiev addressed some of the key issues of retrofit, in partnership with Nottingham City Council \(NCC\), Nottingham City Homes \(NCH\) and Nottingham Energy Partnership \(NEP\), in a large EU H2020 project \(2014\-2020\) \( **G1**\). 

 Ianakiev investigated different levels of retrofit interventions, from simple external wall insultation to the deep retrofit 2050 home standard, for the main types of housing \( **R1**\). He developed sustainable energy solutions that include both measures to improve building fabrics and reduce energy demand and innovations to increase the use of renewable energy and improve the efficiency of community\-level energy supply. These varied solutions have been implemented and tested for economic sustainability, scalability and impact on CO2 reduction in a large\-scale renovation project, involving 463 properties. 

 A highlight of Ianakiev’s work is centred on efforts to achieve near\-zero\-energy homes by offsetting the energy consumption with local energy microgeneration through ground source heat pumps, photovoltaic panels, and electric, as well as thermal, energy storage devices. The management of such a complex hybrid heating system requires a suitable new control system. Ianakiev developed a co\-simulation tool, which is capable of evaluating parameters of both the building envelope and controlling the operation of the energy system, to optimise the fluctuations in energy demand, and improve overall system efficiency. This dynamic energy management system maximises the utilisation of sustainable energy sources, through energy capturing and thermal storage, distributing surplus energy between properties to meet the varying daily demand in order to minimise energy consumption from the national grid at peak times \( **R2**\). 

 District heating to replace individual gas boilers is a route to a fossil fuel\-free future and Low Temperature District Heating \(LTDH\) offers advantages of improving efficiency through reducing heat losses, utilising heat surplus of existing systems and integrating renewable energy sources. Ianakiev led the first large scale LTDH study in the UK, involving 94 low\-rise flats in four buildings in Nottingham. His innovative LTDH control solution maximises the utilisation of low temperature heat by combining measured data in homes, ‘live’ weather data and modelling of the dynamic heating system. It also addresses legionella related risks and peak loads during hot and cold weather \( **R3**\). 

 Hydraulic balance within the heating network is a critical pre\-condition for the efficient implementation of an LTDH network. Ianakiev developed a novel thermo\-hydraulic model, to investigate the hydraulic imbalance in the LTDH network, using real weather and monitored operational heating data from an existing boiler\-based building \( **R4**, **R5**\). Hydraulic imbalance was analysed for four different control scenarios with the aim of finding an optimum strategy with minimum head\-loss, pumping power, and energy consumption \( **R5**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Shaping retrofit practice of social housing provider\(s\)** 

 NTU’s research directly informed the retrofits of 463 properties owned by Nottingham City Homes, which is an arm’s length management organisation of Nottingham City Council. It provided “\[a\] *valuable contribution*” to the task of selection and evaluation of different retrofit solutions \( **S1**\), including 10 properties to ‘2050 deep retrofit’ standard \(the first demonstrator of its kind in the UK\); 94 properties with solid wall insultation and LTDH solutions; 312 properties for solid wall insulation and Light\-Emitting Diode \(LED\) lighting retrofit; the remaining with LED lighting intervention only. The success of this retrofit development is considered a key component of Nottingham City Council’s strategic objective of becoming a carbon neutral city by 2028. 

 The co\-simulation system, developed by the NTU team, provided the baseline modelling for ventilation, temperature, insulation values, energy use/savings for each of the eight property archetypes, including deep retrofit 2050 homes, LTDH, and solid wall insultation retrofit properties \( **S1**\). The system enabled NCH and its supply chain partners to optimise the retrofit solutions for different types of properties \( **S2, S3**\). The NTU team also developed and installed monitoring systems in 41 selected properties, covering all archetypes, to evaluate the impact of retrofit measures. “ *NTU’s contribution was fundamental to capturing and analysing the in\-situ monitoring data, playing a critical role in simulation validation to prove actual energy savings across the different retrofit interventions and property types*” \( **S1**\). 

 The partners have benefited from collaboration with the NTU team with new knowledge of technical solutions for utilising sustainable energy, as well as supply\-chain procurement and innovative financing models \( **S5**\). The collaboration enabled NCH to secure £12m follow up ERDF funding to scale\-up the deep retrofit solution to an additional 155 social houses in Nottingham, including 29 properties in Sneinton \( **S2**\) and £14m funding from the Department of Business, Energy, and Industry Strategy \(BEIS\) for retrofitting 262 houses in the Radford and Lenton areas in Nottingham. Melius Homes has developed knowledge of the 2050 home/Energiesprong concept during the collaboration, and the experience enhanced their skills and knowhow in delivering this model more efficiently/effectively. Its Technical Director stated that “ *NTU enhanced our capacity to implement more effective/efficient energy management systems within a deep retrofit environment to 2050 standards, which we are currently applying to the extra 155 homes within the current contract and intend to replicate in a further potential 500 other publicly owned properties.*” \( **S5**\). 

 **Improving quality of life of over 450 families** 

 The work improved the quality of life of 463 families through reducing fuel poverty and improving in\-door environment conditions. “ *Homes are warmer, lighter, with better air quality and beautiful redesign that has created more internal space. Residents indicated that they felt healthier and their wellbeing had improved because of living in more comfortable and safer homes*” \( **S3**\). The average cost saving on energy use is £866 per household per year. The saving for 2050/Energiesprong homes is greater, from £1850 down to £500, equivalent to a 73% saving \( **S2**, **S4**\). 

 A post\-retrofit survey and interviews with 92 participants, during January to May 2020, found that 85% reported improvement to the quality of their home, with 71% indicating a significant improvement \( **S4**\). 69% reported homes were warmer during winter. 85% of residents receiving solid wall insulation reported an improvement in comfort, with 68% of all residents indicating a significant improvement in the warmth of their home in winter. 87% of households had cheaper energy bills while 100% of residents reported the appearance of their homes improved, with 69% indicating a significant improvement. 100% of The Court’s residents confirmed the internal space within their homes had increased \( **S4**\). In addition to improvements in warmth and cheaper bills, resident testimonies also evidenced enhanced health and wellbeing. “ *Before the refit I had the gas heater \(front room\) and the central heating on all day and night. The house was freezing. Now I have the heating on only 1 and ½ hours a day and it stays warm all night too. I’m much happier cause I can wear less layers of clothing*”. “ *The cold didn’t help my arthritic knees. Going to the toilet/bathroom at night is so much easier \[now\]. My body is so much more relaxed cause I’m not cold anymore. I’m free to walk around the whole home. I sleep better, before it was freezing but now it’s much warmer*”. “ *I had damp and mould in the bathroom before they made changes. \[…\] But when they had a new double\-glazed window, they put in a fan. I’ve not seen any signs of mould since*”. \(pages 28\-30, **S4**\). 

 **Influencing national debate on retrofitting** 

 The NTU team published a White Paper \- “Scale up Retrofit 2050”, jointly with the Institute of Engineering and Technology in 2018 \( **S6**\). It calls for a nationwide programme to boost the energy efficiency of existing homes through deep retrofit; urges both national and local government to take the lead in encouraging systematic change; identifies policy recommendations to overcome current barriers in order to implement more effective housing retrofit policy and practice. The report has generated a broad impact on the on\-going national debate on retrofit of existing homes, evident by: \(1\) it triggered a written question by Lord Jones of Cheltenham in the House of Lords “to ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of research carried out by the Institution of Engineering and Technology and Nottingham Trent University published in their report Scaling Up Retrofit 2050”. In a written answer, Lord Henley confirmed that the government agrees with the main thrust of the White Paper \( **S7**\); \(2\) it was used as a reference in the BEIS Select Committee report into ‘Energy efficiency: building towards ‘net zero’ \( **S8**\); \(3\) it was acknowledged by Alan Whitehead, the Shadow Energy and Clean Growth Minister \(Department for BEIS\) in his article, “The big retrofit challenge: Is ECO up to it?” \( **S9**\); \(4\) it was referenced by Energy UK in their “The voice of the energy industry – Energy and the environment: a ten\-point action plan on tacking climate change” paper. They referenced the White Paper in their recommendation \(no 4\) for government to reinstate zero\-carbon homes initiatives to avoid the need for future retrofitting \( **S10**\).

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by Professor Robert Thomas has led to improvements in the operation and design of administrative justice processes and informed administrative justice policy\-making. These improvements yield considerable social and economic benefit to individual claimants and are crucial in maintaining public confidence in the system of justice through holding government bodies, courts and tribunals to account. These impacts have been achieved through Thomas’s engagement with government policy\-makers, administrative justice institutions, law reform bodies, and the Administrative Justice Council. Specifically, his research has: 

1.  provided the evidence base for the Senior President of Tribunals to argue within government against proposed changes to the immigration judicial review process; 

1.  prompted the Law Commission to undertake a law reform project on the operation of administrative review schemes across Government; 

1.  provided a comprehensive evidence\-base for the first ‘own\-initiative’ investigation by the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman into benefits decision\-making.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 **Immigration judicial review:  Thomas’s recent research into immigration judicial reviews has involved a detailed statistical analysis of tribunal decisions. \[1, 2\]. Two major findings arising from this work were foundational to the impact reported in Section 4. 

 First, the proportion of immigration judicial review cases deemed by the Upper Tribunal \(Immigration and Asylum\) Chamber to be Totally Without Merit rose significantly at a time when the overall caseload had also increased. An unintended consequence of this increase in the number of preliminary negative judgements was that it constrained access to justice, because claims refused permission on the papers deemed Totally Without Merit cannot be renewed at an oral hearing.  Thomas’s research found that the Upper Tribunal \(Immigration and Asylum Chamber\) was inadvertently using the Totally Without Merit mechanism, in part, as a means of regulating its increasing caseload. 

 Second, Thomas’s research revealed that claimants lodging judicial review applications experienced a significantly higher success rate at the oral renewal permission stage than at the earlier paper permission stage. This finding strongly suggested that the process by which cases are considered – on the papers or at an oral hearing – was exerting a significant influence on judicial decision making, thereby affecting the quality of decisions made by judges. Overall, individuals challenging immigration decisions through judicial review whose cases were considered by the tribunal at a hearing were more likely to succeed than individuals whose cases were considered solely on the papers. This finding significantly weakened any argument for removing the oral renewal stage. 

 **Administrative review:** Administrative review is the process by which people who have received a negative administrative decision \(e.g. concerning their immigration status or a benefit claim\) request the same government authority to reconsider that decision. It is important that administrative review operates effectively as it provides a vital means through which individuals are able to secure redress for the denial of basic social goods such as access to social security benefits and the right to reside in the United Kingdom. 

 Drawing upon empirical data, Thomas \(in collaboration with Tomlinson, University of York\) identified the following problems arising from the increased use of administrative review as the first rung in the redress ladder \[3, 4, 5\]. First, he identified that there is a lack of consistent and coherent design of administrative review processes in different areas of government and this design flaw weakens the effectiveness of these processes as a coherent mechanism of administrative justice. Second, he identified significant disparities in success rates between administrative review and tribunal appeals, thereby confirming the variable quality of administrative review systems when compared with judicial tribunals. Third, he identified that the mandatory nature of administrative reviews had led to a significant decline in the number of people accessing appeals, which strongly suggests that the review process dissuades people from pursuing appeals to tribunals. 

 Thomas’s analytical work \[6\] identified ways to improve the quality of administrative decisions, such as: reforming initial administrative decision\-making processes; using feedback from tribunals; making polluters pay; and changing adverse organisational cultures. 

 In summary, the underpinning research advanced principles to inform the design, coherence, and effective operation of administrative review systems, in order to raise the quality of processes and outcomes of administrative review.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

1.  **Prompting resistance to detrimental reform of the immigration judicial review process** 

 The research on immigration judicial review \[1, 2\] was initially published online and then quickly and widely circulated to interested stakeholders. It attracted the attention of the Senior President of Tribunals, the UK’s lead judge in the area. He drew extensively on the research findings to resist proposals from the Cabinet Office to restrict the judicial review process by limiting the availability of oral renewal hearings. The government’s proposals were based upon the low success rate of claimants. The rationale for the proposals was contradicted by Thomas’s research findings that 20 per cent of claimants succeed at the oral renewal stage \[1\]. In private discussions with government, the Senior President of Tribunals strongly relied on the research to contest and ultimately reject the government’s proposals. 

 According to his testimonial, the Senior President of Tribunals “ *drew upon this research in my discussions with Government to argue against proposed changes to the immigration judicial review process to limit the availability of oral renewal hearings. I also took the research as my baseline in discussions with Government about possible procedural and appellate route changes. The research provided an essential insight into how process alters outcomes and access to justice which influenced both the judiciary and Government in their options analysis and will influence changes to primary and secondary legislation, practice direction material and guidance….  Had this research not existed, the discussions I highlight above would have been anecdotal rather than focused on careful, methodologically coherent analysis. Furthermore, the possibility of legal and procedural change for the better would have been considerably reduced”* \[A\]. Following Cabinet briefings, the Cabinet Office’s proposal was withdrawn. 

 As regards reach and significance, 15,000 immigration judicial reviews are lodged per year and there are 2,500 oral renewal permission hearings. Such hearings are more effective than a judge considering a case solely on the papers; the claimant’s barrister can convey the arguments more effectively to the judge. Claimants win 20 per cent of oral renewal hearings. Accordingly, had the government’s proposal been implemented, then one fifth of the claimants \(approx. 500 per year\) who currently win their cases at oral hearings would have been left without this important remedy and would have faced deportation. 

 The research also exerted impact in a very politically\-driven area of policy. Government has long sought to reduce rights of legal challenge in this area. Overall, the research \[1\] supplied an important evidence\-base that the government’s own proposals lacked. 

1.  **Prompting the Law Commission’s project on administrative review** 

 The Law Commission was established in 1965 for the purpose of promoting the reform of the law. In 2016, it launched a public call for proposals for law reform projects. In 2016 Thomas organised an ESRC IAA\-funded roundtable workshop with the support of HM Courts and Tribunals Service and the Administrative Justice Forum. Thomas and Tomlinson presented their research on administrative review to the Law Commission and others. The resulting roundtable discussions and research presentations formed the basis of a submission to the Law Commission. Thomas’s submission to the Commission drew extensively upon the research’s findings about the practical operation of administrative review and the variable quality of administrative review decisions, thereby weakening public confidence in it. The proposal argued that increased use of administrative review revealed weaknesses because it led to significantly lower success rates than tribunal appeals; it had a review success rate of around 18\-20 per cent, compared with a tribunal appeal success rate of over 60 per cent. If administrative review was to work properly, then it needed to be more effective than it is currently. The proposal also presented principles advanced to inform the design of an effective administrative review process. 

 In total, the Law Commission received 1,315 submissions for law reform projects on some 222 different topics. Thomas’s proposal was one of only 13 topics selected for proposed legal reform. As the Law Commission noted: 

 *“Both the submission and the research papers did an admirable job of emphasizing the importance and relevance of internal review processes which precede any kind of judicial recourse, and in particular its importance to lawyers, judges and the courts and tribunals system. The project has the potential to improve the life of many UK citizens, and to improve the efficiency of administrative departments to the benefit of all. I can safely say that the Commission would not be looking to review this area of law were it not for the careful and measured research which Professor Thomas published, and his submission of the project for the inclusion in the Programme”* \[B\]. 

 The Law Commission is still in the process of conducting this project and has not yet produced its final report. While there are no official figures on the total number of administrative reviews decided per year, it can safely be estimated that there are at least one million administrative reviews per year undertaken across the entirety of government at a typical unit cost of GBP80 per review. Improving how administrative review operates will have significant impacts in terms of the quality of routine administrative decisions and the ability of individuals to secure their legal entitlement to, amongst other things, benefits, immigration status, housing, tax liability, education and so on. 

1.  **Providing the comprehensive evidence\-base for investigation by the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman into benefit decision\-making** 

 The research on administrative review \[3\-5\] found significant shortcomings in the operation of the process of mandatory reconsideration. These included: the inadequate scrutiny on the part of Department of Work and Pensions of medical evidence submitted by benefit claimants pertaining to their medical conditions; the challenges faced by vulnerable benefit claimants; the low number of benefit claimants who challenge initial benefit decisions \(with the risk that claimants met with an inadequate mandatory reconsideration decision are unlikely to mount a second challenge\); and the low success rate of mandatory reconsiderations compared with tribunal appeals. The research was circulated and presented through Thomas’ role as member of the Administrative Justice Council and co\-chair of its Academic Panel. 

 The research provided a direct evidence base for the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman \(NIPSO\) in its decision to commence the first ever “own\-initiative investigation” into the operation of disability benefits \(Personal Independence Payments\) and the administrative review process known as “mandatory reconsideration. **\[Text removed for publication\]** 

 The outcome of the Ombudsman’s investigation is awaited. Clearly, the research exerted a major impact in both prompting and focusing the investigation, in particular on questioning the ability of administrative reviews to provide an effective check of initial benefit decisions. \[ **Text removed for publication\]** An interim update, published in July 2020, indicates that the role of evidence in mandatory reconsideration requests remains a key element of the investigation \[D\]. The report into the investigation is due to be published in early 2021. 

 The wider reach and significance of the impact is demonstrated by the number of people affected. Around 150,000 people claim Personal Independence Payments in Northern Ireland. Since 2016, there have been some 56,610 mandatory reconsiderations in Northern Ireland. It is likely that the investigation will exert a wider influence on benefit decision making in Britain, where there are some 300,000 mandatory reconsiderations per year \(PIP & other benefits\). An enhanced and more effective mandatory reconsideration process would reduce the number and cost of tribunal appeals and anxiety for people concerned. Currently, there are 300,000 tribunal appeals per year at a cost of GBP592 per an appeal.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research on the monetary history of West Africa has underpinned an LSE collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution and the creation of new digital collections. These resources have engaged new audiences and enhanced understanding of the economic, political, and social histories of West Africa, and contributed to a decolonisation of the Smithsonian collection. Teaching resources based on the collection have been tailored to the history curriculum of the 96 public schools in Loudoun County, Virginia, and made public on the Smithsonian’s education platform, Learning Lab. At the same time, the innovative ""research\-led digitisation"" model of showcasing small\-scale but historically significant collections has influenced how other Smithsonian curators approach their own digitisations, and has recently been extended to the digitisation of Smithsonian collections from South Africa.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Currencies and their use provide a window into wider histories of trade, politics, and cultural interaction. In West Africa, they reflect the complex legacies of colonial rule and decolonisation. It was once popular to refer to a “currency revolution”, in which colonial coins and notes displaced indigenous currencies with the advent of imperial rule, and were later replaced by national currencies after independence. Subsequent research has painted a more nuanced picture of the interaction of economic, political, and monetary change in the region over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries **\[1\] \[2\] \[3\]**. 

 Central to Dr Leigh Gardner’s research has been the study of how specific coins, notes, and other objects were used as currency by different communities. In Europe, the nineteenth century saw the consolidation of multiple currency systems into the system of national currencies we know today. Far from being the norm, however, such systems were historically exceptional. In Africa, different currencies were used for different types of transactions, often contrary to the intentions of colonial and post\-independence governments **\[1\] \[2\]**. In this way, trade, politics, and culture intersected to form complicated monetary geographies which were shaped as much by Africans as by European colonisers. 

 Case studies of individual countries provide some of the most vivid illustrations of these patterns. One example is the issue of the Liberian dollar after Liberia’s declaration of independence in 1847 **\[1\]**. Liberia remained one of the only parts of Sub\-Saharan Africa to maintain formal political sovereignty through the colonial period, a point which the issue of the currency was intended to emphasise. Joseph Roberts, the first President of Liberia, claimed that the new coins would provide the “stamp of nationality” for the Liberian state. The first coins had the image of an allegorical woman wearing a cap associated in classical imagery with freed slaves on one side, and of a ship and an oil palm on the other, reflecting the key anchors of the Liberian economy. However, the exercise of monetary sovereignty by the Liberian government faced immediate practical challenges due to its limited resources, which resulted in the de facto adoption of British colonial currency. This provided economic stability but amounted to a concession of Liberian sovereignty; Liberian officials feared that the use of coins bearing the words “British West Africa” in the country was an attempt to “British\-ise Liberia”, in the words of the Liberian President at the time. During World War II, US dollars replaced British currency, and to this day Liberia retains a dual\-currency system which uses the US dollar and the Liberian dollar simultaneously. 

 Another case uses monetary history to show how attempts to compromise between political and commercial imperatives often had unanticipated consequences **\[2\]**. In the early twentieth century, the Gambia was a tiny British colony surrounded by French Senegal. When British rule was established, the colonial government acknowledged that the local economy was dependent on trade with Senegal and set a fixed exchange rate between British sterling and the French franc. This created opportunities for substantial profits from arbitrage when the international rate of exchange began to fluctuate during World War I and the following decades. Enterprising African traders profited handsomely by crossing the long land border between Senegal and the Gambia, exchanging French five\-franc coins \(which were historically associated with the groundnut trade\) for sterling coins at the official rate, then crossing the border again to buy francs at the depreciated international rate. 

 This research illustrates how understanding the use of money in Africa across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries helps to answer wider questions about the extent of state capacity and colonial control, as well as the influence of global shifts in exchange rates on African economies **\[4\] \[5\]**. Crucial to this work is the fact that the objects themselves had meaning, both for those who issued them and those who used them. After independence, African governments faced important choices about both the extent to which monetary ties to former colonisers should be maintained, and how to use coins and banknotes to express their newfound political freedom **\[3\]**. 

 By providing access to images of the objects themselves through digitisation, and the curation of sub\-collections on the Learning Lab platform, this project helps bring these histories to a wider audience of students and the general public.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Over the course of a collaboration between the LSE and the Smithsonian Institution, the underpinning research has been used to create innovative new digital collections and physical exhibits. These collections and resources have contributed to the preservation of the cultural heritage of West Africa, engaged new audiences and enhanced understanding of its monetary history, and also helped to decolonise Smithsonian collections. Digital collections tailored to the 10th\-grade history curriculum and posted to the Smithsonian’s education platform \(Learning Lab\) highlight the applications of the collection for teaching. This collaborative project has also developed a new ""research\-led digitisation"" approach to showcasing small but historically significant collections, one that has already influenced other Smithsonian curators. 

 *Smithsonian\-LSE collaboration* 

 The collaboration began when Gardner approached Dr Ellen Feingold, Curator of the National Numismatic Collection \(NNC\) at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History \(NMAH\), for permission to digitise images of a selection of coins and notes for a forthcoming book. This led to broader discussions based on recent research about the ways in which currency objects could tell wider stories about political and economic change in West Africa for use in teaching, research, and public history. As the Smithsonian did not have resources to support the digitisation of small but historically important collections like this one, the LSE agreed to provide funding for the project from its knowledge exchange and impact funds. 

 **Creation of new digital collections for the Smithsonian** 

 The heart of the project is a new  [open\-access digital collection](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search?edan_q=west%20african%20currency&edan_local=1&edan_fq%5B%5D=topic:%22West+African+Currency%22) of 880 coins, banknotes, and other objects used as currency from West Africa **\[A\]**. This collection was first made publicly available on the Smithsonian website in August 2019. Subsequently, sub\-collections have been curated for classroom use. Availability through the Smithsonian’s platforms is particularly significant; as the world’s largest museum, and through its vast physical and digital presence, it aims to reach a billion users worldwide. According to the Head of Digital Programs at the NMAH, the West Africa project “ *offers a new way of engaging with wider audiences and, crucially, assessing the effect of that research outside academia*” **\[B\]**. 

 Understanding the history of currency objects themselves – why they were created, where they circulated, and what they communicated to their users – has been central to knowledge about how monetary systems developed and reflected wider economic, political, and social changes. However, access to these objects remains a challenge, and research is often targeted at specialist audiences. As of 2020, there is no comparative numismatic collection in sub\-Saharan Africa, and much of what is held in museums elsewhere has either not yet been digitised or is not easily discoverable in large, museum\-wide collection databases. Catalogue entries for these objects often reflect dated understandings of how they were used. This project offers a new perspective on the economic, political, and social histories of the region, engaging new audiences and contributing to an enhanced understanding of the topic. 

 The 880 objects digitised as part of this project included coins and banknotes from the colonial and post\-independence eras as well as a range of alternative currencies like cowrie shells, manillas, and iron bars known as Kissi pennies. The images created are open access and can be used freely by scholars and educators in Africa and beyond. As part of the digitisation process, Gardner’s recent research **\[1\] \[2\] \[3\] \[4\]**, among others’, was drawn upon to update object descriptions, for example by removing dated or often offensive language referring to alternative currencies as “primitive” or “curious”, and replacing with new versions which reflect more recent scholarly understandings of indigenous monetary systems **\[C\]**. In this way, the project has contributed to a decolonisation of this Smithsonian collection. 

 The project has been well\-received among professionals in public history, digital humanities, and other fields. In May 2020, *Reviews in Digital Humanities* described the project as “ *a wonderful resource that will bring an otherwise rather obscure collection into a wide range of lesson plans and research projects*” **\[D\]**. It has also featured in the February 2020 edition of E\-Sylum, a numismatics newsletter with a large readership. 

 **Smithsonian Learning Lab – impacts on educational practices** 

 As literature on digitisation notes, it is one thing to place an image of an object online, and another to get people to use them in teaching. To facilitate the use of these objects in teaching, several sub\-collections were curated for use on the Smithsonian’s Learning Lab platform **\[E\]**, which is targeted for use by educators and has around 600,000 current users. Gardner and Feingold selected relevant objects for each sub\-collection and wrote the supporting material, based on the underpinning research. One of these  [collections](https://learninglab.si.edu/collections/money-and-exchange-in-west-africa/5riFCVvFDNcXodgL), “Money and Exchange in West Africa”, used a selection of the objects to tell the story of how money has changed in West Africa since the nineteenth century. Others focused on particular themes in West African history, including: 1\)  [the shift from indigenous colonial currencies](https://learninglab.si.edu/collections/what-did-money-look-like-under-colonial-rule-in-west-africa/rnXBKDu8EEuGdCEq); 2\)  [decolonisation and the transition to independence](https://learninglab.si.edu/collections/how-did-new-african-countries-use-money-to-show-their-independence/f6DbM2nPKPdL5Wd2); and 3\)  [the impact of the Second World War in West Africa](https://learninglab.si.edu/collections/how-did-world-war-ii-affect-west-africa/6ipMEY9t4Dtbgyf0) **\[E\]**. 

 To illustrate the potential for Learning Labs to be customised for particular education goals, three of the Learning Labs \(colonialism, decolonisation, and World War II\) were tailored to specific modules in the World History curriculum taught to 10<sup>th</sup>\-graders \(15\-16\-year\-olds\) in the Loudoun County, Virginia, school system. Loudoun County has 96 schools and a total enrolment of 81,964 students, including 6,829 in 10<sup>th</sup> grade **\[F\]**. The Labs were designed and developed in collaboration with the NMAH’s educators team and their network of teachers with the intention of promoting their use in classrooms, with “ *Dr Gardner’s scholarship \[playing\] a key role*” **\[C\]**. The social studies department chair at one school wrote that she “ *definitely \[thinks\] our students would benefit from seeing these*”, and identified various ways in which students might engage with the objects in the course of their learning, such as researching who appears on coins and notes in different periods, and using their findings as a basis for debating who should be the next person on US currency **\[G\]**. 

 The Senior Education Specialist at the NMAH has highlighted the impressive and diverse pedagogical potential of these new digital resources. After they were shared with teachers in the northern Virginia region, she commented not only on their benefits to learning, but also on their deeper cultural value: "" *the resources present significant potential learning opportunities for developing global competencies and critical thinking skills among students, as well as providing a powerful method for validating and centring the experience of students who may have cultural ties to the nations represented. Teaching with the West African currency can help students develop cross\-cultural understandings. They will have the opportunity to see connections across time and cultures and through this broaden their understanding of what it means to be a global citizen with awareness of and empathy for the experience of people in nations outside of their own. The currency provides a launching point for understanding not only economic systems, but also cultural identities and how people adapt to change and continuity, through which students may recognise similarities and differences to their own cultures and see others as part of their global community*"" **\[H\]**. 

 While the promotion of actual classroom use was delayed by school shutdowns, the objects and Learning Labs have received significant downloads thus far. As of February 2021, object pages have been accessed 5,071 times by 3,517 users. Collectively, the Learning Labs have been viewed 2,813 times by 540 unique users **\[I\]**. As schools reopen, we will build on these initial foundations by reaching out to additional networks of teachers. 

 **Contribution to National Museum of American History exhibition** 

 Alongside the digital sub\-collections was a physical display on the history of the US dollar in Liberia, based on **\[1\]**, opened in October 2019 as part of the “Value of Money” exhibition at the NMAH. The Curator of the NNC has called this “ *a meaningful contribution in terms of diversifying the lenses through which we interpret American history and which histories are included in it*” **\[C\]**. The museum receives around 4 million visitors annually. A  [virtual version](https://learninglab.si.edu/collections/u-s-dollars-in-liberia/xNXunzUXDYnD8iEe) of the display also appears on Learning Lab. The display was the subject of a  [post](https://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/dollars-liberia) on the Smithsonian’s *O Say Can You See?* blog **\[J\]** and a presentation at the NMAH Colloquium series in November 2019, with an audience of around 30 curators and other museum staff. As of 5 January 2021, the blog post has received 2,380 unique page views. 

 **Development of a new “research\-led digitisation” approach** 

 This project has also provided a new template for partnerships between museums and universities: “research\-led digitisation”. Digitisation projects at museums generally aim to place images online so that they become the subject of research, maximising access by digitising as many objects or documents as possible with minimal description. Such projects are dependent on grant or donor funding and tend to prioritise large collections. In research\-led digitisation, scholars and curators can digitise smaller but historically significant collections, using current research to update object descriptions and help facilitate the use of the digital images in teaching. The Curator of the NNC has noted how "" *this approach is already having an impact on how other Smithsonian curators think about digitising their collections*"" **\[C\]**. Similarly, the Head of Digital Programs at the NMAH has said “ *this same model is potentially generalisable across multiple public history institutions, and may help in diversifying sources of funding for digitisation projects while at the same time providing new avenues for the public dissemination of academic research*” **\[B\]**. An article explaining this new model of collaboration is the cover feature for the November 2020 issue of *Perspectives on History* **\[K\]**, the American Historical Association’s news magazine, which is circulated to 15,000 individual and institutional AHA members, 40% of whom are students, teachers, public historians, and publishers. 

 **Extension to South Africa** 

 This project and its “research\-led digitisation” model has already been extended to South Africa. Gardner and Feingold were approached by Johan Fourie at Stellenbosch University, who wanted to digitise the NNC’s South African materials as part of a series of events commemorating the centenary of the South African Reserve Bank. Again supported by the LSE’s knowledge exchange and impact funds, 714 coins, notes, and other currency objects are to be digitised and will be used as the basis for new digital sub\-collections on the Learning Lab, offering new perspectives on the history of political and economic change in South Africa over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from the establishment of colonial regimes to the South African War and the rise and fall of apartheid. Alongside the Learning Labs, lesson plans specifically tailored to the South African history curriculum will enable the use of the digitised objects in teaching at school and university level, providing the basis for a new, “bottom\-up” history of money in South Africa **\[C\]**. This was due to commence in Autumn 2020 but has been delayed by the forced closure of the Smithsonian.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Perceptive Engineering Limited \(PEL\) formed in 2003 to exclusively exploit novel model predictive control and monitoring systems that were developed at the University of Manchester. These control and monitoring systems maintained product quality and detected faults within operational processes with sufficient robustness for them to be integrated into industrial plant safety systems. Since 2013, PEL’s annual turnover has increased \[text removed for publication\] in 2020. It employs 30 full time staff across its business in four countries. The developed technology is benefitting manufacturing and utility companies, providing financial savings \[text removed for publication\] worldwide, as well as delivering considerable environmental benefits in the form of reduced CO<sub>2</sub>. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The impact is based on research undertaken at The University of Manchester \(UoM\) in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. The research aim was \(and continues to be\) to develop algorithms and techniques that enable large\-scale industrial processes to be both monitored and controlled in real\-time. Sandoz and Lennox pioneered research by integrating condition\-monitoring capabilities offered by multivariate statistical techniques with model predictive control. This integration enabled control systems to be developed and applied to processes that previously operated inefficiently in open\-loop. When operating in open\-loop, a plant is unable to respond to abnormalities, such as disturbances and equipment faults, thus considerably reducing plant efficiency. The UoM research led to a series of mathematical techniques and algorithms capable of simultaneously regulating and monitoring processes where sensors are unreliable and/or operate in batch mode. 

  

 The key results were: 

1.  Novel multivariate statistical algorithms were developed that can be used in real\-time to detect faults with sufficient robustness for them to be integrated into plant safety systems and automatically shut down equipment when necessary \[1, 2\]. Prior to this work, multivariate fault detection techniques were not sufficiently robust to be applied automatically and in real\-time, and therefore were not delivering their potential benefits. 

1.  Multivariate statistical models were shown to provide an integrated approach to monitoring and control. This research enabled system controllers to be developed that were able to monitor their own performance and determine when re\-modelling or re\-tuning was required \[3\]. Furthermore, it enabled the development of controllers that can cope seamlessly with poor\-quality sensor measurements \[4\]. For the first time, this meant that these system controllers were appropriate for use in areas such as wastewater treatment where sensor measurements can be unreliable. 

1.  A series of algorithms, able to provide simple and accurate control and monitoring of processes that operate in a batch manner, were developed. These algorithms were tested in case studies involving the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and food, and were found to be suitable even in situations where the length of each batch varied considerably \[5\]. This proved that this technology could be used to improve the efficiency of batch processes, most notably those in the pharmaceutical industry. 

  

 This research remains highly productive and continues to generate impact. Joint research projects between PEL and UoM focus on enabling state\-of\-the\-art control technology to be applied to solve manufacturing problems in the UK and overseas \[4\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 The use of multivariate statistical techniques for detecting faults on process plants is well documented. However, before this UoM research by Sandoz and Lennox, industrial uptake of this technology was slow and virtually non\-existent in real\-time applications. Sandoz and Lennox introduced novel methods that were shown to be robust and implementable within model predictive control structures. This enabled the research team to apply multivariate techniques in real\-time and allowed them to apply model predictive control systems to processes where prior technology could not be applied. 

  

##  Pathway to impact 

 The research was presented at leading academic and industry\-facing conferences, including the International Federation of Automatic Control World Congress \[2002, 2005, 2008, 2011\], Computer Applications in Biotechnology \[2001\], and the SAFEPROCESS symposium \[2006\]. This exposure led to interest from several companies, including Swedish Steel, Pfizer and North West Water who engaged in application studies with the researchers. In addition to these case studies, the global technology company Invensys provided approximately GBP500,000 to develop a generic condition monitoring software system. 

 In 2003, with support \[text removed for publication\] from The University of Manchester’s Technology Fund, the spin\-out company Perceptive Engineering Ltd \(PEL\) was formed to exploit the process control and process monitoring research that had been conducted at UoM \[A\]. 

  

##  Reach and significance of the impact since 2013 

 \[Text removed for publication\]. The control and monitoring technologies marketed by PEL, developed as a result of the UoM research \[1\-5\], have benefited a wide range of industrial sectors through improved plant efficiency, reduced operating costs, increased productivity and reduced energy usage. This has resulted in combined financial savings \(described below\) \[text removed for publication\]. 

 As a result of the work that has developed out of UoM, PEL has won a range of awards since 2013, including the 2016/17 Rushlight Award \(sector excellence for clean technologies\), the 2015 Water Industry Achievement Award for “Most innovative use of an existing technology”, and the 2016 Merseyside Innovation Award for wastewater treatment. In 2019, PEL was awarded Business of the Year in the Cheshire Business Awards, and was shortlisted in two categories in the Water and Energy Exchange Global Awards 2020 \[A\]. 

  

##  Water and wastewater – improving process efficiency 

 PEL has completed installations of their control systems for \[text removed for publication\] major water and sewerage companies in the UK, including United Utilities, Welsh Water and Northumbrian Water. 

 United Utilities is the largest operator of clean and wastewater networks in the UK. They use sensors to ensure activated sludge plants operate at maximum efficiency: over or under efficient aeration of these plants can result in unnecessary energy use \(over aeration\) or loss of compliance \(under aeration\) \[B\]. Drawing on the UoM research, PEL used the control and monitoring technologies to construct a control system for United Utilities. The project, initially intended as ‘proof of concept’, was so successful that it resulted in a full installation at Lancaster Wastewater Treatment Works. As confirmed by the Asset Standards and Innovation team at United Utilities “ *average energy savings over 12 months has been 26% when compared with previous best performance….United Utilities calculates an annual reduction in equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> of more than 250 tonnes for this plant alone*” \[B\]. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

##  Pulp and paper – increasing yield and reducing energy costs 

 PEL designed control systems are currently operating in five pulp and paper plants in Europe, Australia, Asia and the USA owned by companies such as Smurfit\-Kappa and Aylesford Newsprint Limited. These control systems have been independently assessed and found to have reduced steam usage \[text removed for publication\], reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions \[text removed for publication\] and overall have reduced product costs \[text removed for publication\]. 

 Smurfit\-Kappa operate paper production plants in over 30 countries, with their UK Birmingham mill producing fluting and test liner paper from 100% recycled packaging waste \[C\]. A particular challenge with recycled paper is variability in its quality and hence drainability. This leads to variations in the production machine’s stability, increases in steam consumption, and overall reduced efficiency of the machine. To address this, PEL provided an Advanced Process Control solution based on the UoM research \[C\]. This model provided closed loop control of the system to manage paper weight and moisture in the machine, and adjust the production rate accordingly. This reduced the variability of the quality of the final product, and specifically resulted in a reduction in steam consumption of 3%, which corresponds to a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 1,600te/year \( *tonnes equivalent*\) \[C\]. 

 Aylesford Newsprint Limited operate two paper machine plants at their Aylesford site in the UK, producing an average of 400,000t of recycled newsprint per year \[D\]. This process involves a series of pulping, cleaning, screening, ink\-floatation, bleaching and thickening stages depending on the specific requirement of the final quality specification. Using the UoM process and control research, PEL delivered an Advanced Process Control system on Aylesford’s De\-Inking plant to provide coordinated control of product quality, production rate, and process constraints \[D\]. This system enables Aylesford staff to enter costs of the source materials and chemicals as they change, which the optimiser can then balance. Aylesford’s Full Package Production Manager has confirmed "" *The Perceptive APC system installed on our process has provided significant improvements in quality and process stability. The system has reduced the standard deviation of final brightness by 60% while optimising production rate, chemical dosages and yield in real\-time*” \[D\]. 

##  Benefiting the nutritional powders and pharmaceuticals sector 

 \[Text removed for publication\]. In November 2020, PEL was purchased \(for an undisclosed amount\) by Applied Materials, a USD17,000,000,000 US company, as part of their strategic plan to build a stronger presence in the pharmaceutical sector. PEL’s PharmaMV® advanced process control \(APC\) platform is to supplement Applied Materials’ SmartFactory Rx® portfolio \[F\]. The Managing Director of Applied Materials Pharma has stated that this acquisition enables Applied Materials’ clients “ *to bring powerful new therapies to market with assured quality, higher yields, reduced costs and all with optimised productivity*"" \[F\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by Dr Smith into rape trials in England and Wales through court observation has informed criminal justice practice and enhanced justice through improved court practices during trial. This has benefitted criminal justice practitioners, policy makers, non\-government organisations \(NGOs\) and campaign groups, and, indirectly, rape complainants. 

 Between 2015 and 2020, research led to: 

-  the instigation of a court observer panel in Northumbria and thence to the implementation of the first system of court inspection in England and Wales, and later in Northern Ireland 

-  improved knowledge and practice of criminal justice practitioners, as a result of the observer panel instilling greater confidence in the criminal justice process 

-  changes in the recommendations of the Northern Irish Gillen Review into rape trials 

-  informing the Judicial Studies Board rape review methodology, and the provision of evidence underpinning NGO campaigns and media coverage of policy reform related to rape trials.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Developing policy and practice to ensure respectful and fair responses to rape complaints continues to be hampered by apparent contradictions: interviewed complainants assert that rape trials were a traumatic experience; legal professionals argue they are conducted to ensure all evidence is heard. To reconcile these two perspectives, Smith’s studies comprise the first comprehensive observation of the full rape trial process in England and Wales since significant legislation was introduced in the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The court observation methodology developed by Smith allowed the study of proceedings in court to move beyond contrasting perspectives to closely examine the trial process. 

 Building on her ESRC\-funded PhD project \[1\], Smith undertook detailed further analysis of court observation findings and rape trials policy following her appointment at Anglia Ruskin University which were published in outputs in 2017 and 2018 \[2,3,4\]. Output \[2\] examined the practical aspects of trials and found several causes of inefficiency and distress, such as delays, problems with evidence disclosure, and inadequate witness facilities. It argued that these practicalities are often trivialised or ignored during trials but are central to justice as they represent access to meaningful participation. Output \[3\], in collaboration with T. Skinner \(contributed 25% to output\), showed that ‘rape myths’ remain prevalent at trial despite some challenges by prosecution barristers and judges. While policy debates had focused on the importance of training legal professionals about rape, the article demonstrated that problematic attitudes were not the main cause of rape myths being used in trial narratives. Instead, it suggested that rape myths were used because of the adversarial imperative to win and the rationalist legal tradition, which dismisses complainants’ evidence as irrational and untruthful. Alongside \[2\], this article demonstrated the value of court observation methodologies in creating different forms of data that would not be accessible using alternative methods such as interviews. 

 In 2018, Smith published a monograph, *Rape Trials in England and Wales: Observing Justice and Rethinking Rape Myths* \[4\], which examined the deep\-rooted barriers to survivor justice during rape trials and introduced potential avenues for more effective reform. It developed previous outputs by demonstrating that controversial evidence about the complainant’s sexual history was being used routinely at trial, mostly to explain evidence introduced by the prosecution. The book also argued that most policy aimed at improving trial experiences is undermined by the influence of wider societal inequalities. For example, women complainants were dismissed as irrational and therefore untrustworthy in a variety of intersecting ways depending on their perceived social class, disability, and ethnicity. This has implications for current policy, which assumes that myths about rape can be tackled by adding judicial directions about common misunderstandings, while ignoring any potential myths about rape complainants themselves. Output \[4\] also situated Smith’s research in the light of \#MeToo and high\-profile trials such as that of footballer Ched Evans.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This body of research has three main areas of cumulative impact: 

###  <ins>Implementation of the first system of court inspection in England and Wales, and later Northern Ireland</ins> 

 After discussing Smith’s trial observations and the benefits of the court observer method, the then Police, Fire & Crime Commissioner for Northumbria \(now Victims’ Commissioner for England and Wales\) piloted a volunteer court observer panel \(COP\) between January 2015 and June 2016. The scheme “represented an innovative move to provide accountability in rape trials, as there is currently no independent inspectorate for the courts in England and Wales” \[S1\]. The panel observed 30 rape trials and in February 2017 its findings led to national policy debate in which Smith’s research was cited as initiating the scheme \[S2\]. 

 In 2018, the court observer panel was also implemented in Northern Ireland, and Smith delivered a training package for Victim Support Northern Ireland to 11 \(100%\) of the court observer volunteers \[S3\] \[S4\]. 27 trials were observed by the panel between October 2018 and October 2019, the results of which revealed extensive problems with delays, technical difficulties, rape myths and sexual history evidence. The Final Report on the implementation of the panels acknowledged “Dr. Olivia Smith and Dame Vera Baird, whose original Seeing is Believing report was inspiration for us to launch a Northern Irish equivalent Court Observers Panel” \[S4\]. 

 The Commissioner also expanded the court observer panel to Specialist Domestic Violence Courts in Northumbria. Between July and September 2017, volunteers observed 170 cases, the findings of which have informed Hansard debates about the Domestic Violence & Abuse Bill \(House of Commons, 18 July 2018\) \[S5\]. The Commissioner noted that, “without Dr Smith’s original research… these important changes would not have been possible” \[S1\]. 

###  <ins>Improved knowledge and practice of criminal justice practitioners</ins> 

 The Northumbria COP identified the importance of Independent Sexual Violence Advisors \(ISVAs\) in explaining court proceedings and supporting victims. Following discussions with the judiciary, prosecutors, and investigation teams, along with third sector support organisations, “it was agreed that the barrister when having the pre\-case conversation with the victim would ask if there was an ISVA and if so would ask for her to accompany the victim at all material times in court” \[S1\]. The COP also provided evidence about the frequency of late prosecution applications to disclose the victim’s sexual history \(s.41 applications\) which cause significant delays. The North Eastern Crown Prosecution Service \(CPS\) subsequently agreed at every pre\-trial preliminary hearing they would actively ask if there was to be a s.41 application to reduce the number of late s.41 applications and delays during trial \[S1\]. 

 Between 2017 and 2020 Smith has delivered training to practitioners from third sector organisations, police, prosecutors, probation, housing and social work services, as well as presenting at the Annual Rape Crisis Conference \(in 2017, 2018 and 2020\) to approximately 400 ISVAs, on the use of evidence in investigations, prosecution of sexual violence and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. This has made ISVAs “more equipped to support and inform through the trial process, leading to increased survivor engagement with the Criminal Justice System”, according to the Chairwoman of Rape Crisis England & Wales \[S6\]. 

 In Northern Ireland, the Gillen Review into rape trials highlighted the COP as key to sustainable change in future: “I applaud this development and look forward to its informed input into the criminal justice system. I consider that in the wake of our own local Court Observer project, informed consideration should be given to extending this project to embrace the notion of local panels comprised of local members of the community… I believe this could engender further confidence in the criminal justice process” \[S7\]. 

###  <ins>Provided an evidence\-base for the Northern Irish Gillen Review into rape trials, the Judicial Studies Board rape review,</ins> <ins>non\-government organisation \(</ins><ins>NGO</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>campaigns and media coverage of rape reform</ins> 

 Smith’s research is a significant evidence\-base for national reviews into rape trials and for NGOs and women’s organisations campaigning for legal reform of rape trials focusing on the behaviour of the complainant, rather than the defendant. 

 The Gillen Review into the law and procedures in serious sexual offences ran from 2017 to 2019 and produced over 250 recommendations. The CEO of Victim Support Northern Ireland and a Gillen Review panel member said: “Smith’s research was a key resource … and influenced the discussions in particular around the use of rape myths” \[S3\]. 

 Smith is cited throughout Gillen’s final report as support for the recommendation to introduce legal representation for complainants, maintain the status quo on defendant anonymity, collect better data on complainants from marginalised groups, and retain juries for rape cases. Engagement with Smith’s work also led to a significant change in Gillen’s report. The interim report stated that “public discussion and policy should only be based on research that \[…\] can arguably come only from systematic research with actual juries at court” \(Gillen, 2018: 6.117\). However, this recommendation was removed and cited Smith’s consultation response as the reason for the change. Similarly, the interim Gillen report stated that there was no need to reform the use of sexual history evidence, but the final report \- citing Smith’s response \- added a recommendation “that the Department of Justice should carry out an exercise to determine the extent of the admission of previous sexual experience in trials in Northern Ireland which, when taken alongside the reports from the current Court Observers Panel scrutiny, should provide a basis to consider if more serious legislative intervention is required” \(s. 8.102\) \[S7\]. 

 In 2019, Smith’s research informed the England and Wales Judicial Studies Board’s rape review methodology \[S8\]. The Rape Review Lead for the Ministry of Justice stated that Smith’s “insightful advice” about sample sizes, data collection, and literature reviews “enabled us to produce robust and detailed project plans, helping to steer the review and provide government leaders and third\-party organisations with confidence that this review will really help tackle the fall in rape prosecutions” \[S8\]. 

 Smith’s research is also used by leading campaign groups. Since 2014 Rape Crisis have quoted Smith’s findings in their consultation with policy makers, such as the National Council of Police Chiefs, Cross\-Governmental rape review, and Home Office working groups for the Victims Code and Witness Strategy \[S6\]. Smith also informed an extensive cross\-party campaign in 2018, signed by 9 organisations, 17 members of parliament and 6 Baronesses, to change the law on sexual history evidence during rape trials.  The central evidence to this campaign was the *Seeing is Believing* Report which used court observations informed by Smith’s initial research \[S9\]. The End Violence Against Women \(EVAW\) Coalition’s Rape Justice Fail campaign was informed by Smith’s observation research and the CEO commented: “We do not believe we would have the clearly refined messages we now have, which are critical to campaigning, without this \[Smith’s research\]” \[S10\]. As a result of the EVAW Coalition campaign, there has been “a major Guardian newspaper campaign \(featuring in the front page every day for a week in Sept/Oct 2018\), reaching millions of readers on\- and off\-line … and briefing more than a dozen MPs on the key problems in the justice system for rape complainants, specifically citing Olivia’s research” \[S10\]. 

 In 2019, Smith was cited in a BBC Radio 4 documentary, *Rape Trials: Is the Jury Out?* on policy reform in rape trials and also consulted on a BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat segment and a BBC 5live Investigates documentary. This media coverage has raised awareness of issues within rape trials highlighted by the research and policy reform in this area. Public statistics show that taken together BBC Radio 4, Radio 1 and 5live reached approximately 25,179,000 listeners in the July–September 2019 quarter when these programmes aired \(RAJAR, 2020\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The best protection against torture is provided by safeguards when people are first arrested. The research that established this has changed practices worldwide and protected thousands from torture. 

 Dr Richard Carver’s research into torture prevention focused on the protection of people in police custody, and has challenged previous assumptions by the United Nations \(UN\), regional human rights bodies and non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) about the most effective way to prevent torture. Previous policy was based on monitoring detention places, and investigating and prosecuting torturers. These aspects are important, but Dr Carver’s research showed that by far the best protection is to have effective safeguards in place when people are first arrested. 

 As a result of these findings, UN anti\-torture bodies and two prominent international NGOs have changed their approach. The research has also shaped policy and practice in the Republic of Georgia, Uruguay, Ethiopia and the United Kingdom, leading to greater protection for thousands of people previously at risk of torture. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2012, the Association for the Prevention of Torture \(APT\), a Geneva\-based NGO, appointed an independent research team directed by Dr Carver to conduct a three\-year international study. Their aim was to determine whether existing torture prevention measures work, and what can be done to reduce the risk of people being tortured. Dr Carver was selected for his previous work on determining the effectiveness of national human rights institutions, as well as his research into the incidence of torture. The research has produced a book: *Does Torture Prevention Work?* \(Liverpool University Press, 2016\) **\[R1\]**, co\-authored by Dr Carver and Dr Lisa Handley, visiting research academic at Oxford Brookes University \(OBU\). 

 The study looked at the impact of torture prevention mechanisms across 16 countries over a 30\-year period \(1985–2014\). The research team included more than 20 country specialists, with collaboration from academic institutions, as well as human rights groups and individual researchers. No other UK academic institutions were involved in this international study. 

 The study was the largest of its kind and has been praised for its innovation. It used both quantitative and qualitative methods to find the impact of four types of preventive measures on the incidence of torture. It looked at existing international laws in the field of torture prevention, as well as recommendations often made by the UN, regional human rights bodies, NGOs and so on. 

 The study found that legal reforms on their own had very little impact on reducing torture. The creation of independent complaints mechanisms was also found to have no significant positive impact. However, when legal obligations were translated into practice, some of the preventive measures worked. **The most important example of this was that safeguards for people in their first hours in police custody had a considerable impact on reducing the incidence of torture.** The most important safeguards were: 

-  ending unofficial and undocumented detention 

-  notifying a third person of arrest and detention 

-  prompt access to a lawyer 

-  a right to independent medical examination. 

 Other types of preventive measure – such as investigation and prosecution of torturers, and the creation of independent monitoring mechanisms – also had a positive impact. But the finding that detention safeguards were the most effective prevention measure was echoed in all the statistical analysis undertaken, and a series of qualitative case studies were researched that reached the same conclusions **\[R1, R3 & R4\]**. 

 **This finding represents a significant change of emphasis in international agendas on torture prevention.** It would not have been particularly surprising to human rights activists, for example those providing legal representation or medical services to people in police custody. However, international and regional torture prevention bodies have previously emphasised the use of monitoring and complaint mechanisms along with investigation and prosecution, but not detention safeguards. \[See, for example, Nigel S Rodley, “Reflections on Working for the Prevention of Torture,” *Essex Hum. Rights Rev.* 6, 2009.\] Given this prior consensus, shared by APT, evidence of change at the international policy and country level was vital to validate the impact of the research. 

 The research found that actual practice in torture prevention varied according to place. Geographical dummy variables were used in some of the regression models in the study, showing that European and South American countries were less likely to torture than those in other geographical regions \(Africa, Western and Central Asia, and Eastern and Southern Asia\). However, the effectiveness of the various preventive measures was consistent in all places – that is, Europe and South America tortured less because the most effective preventive measures were applied more consistently **\[R1, R5\]**. 

 One interpretation of the findings is that the risk of torture varies according to carceral geographies \(the spaces and practices of detention\). In other words, risk was found to be highest outside official custody, where no legal safeguards apply. The next highest risk is in police custody, and then in prison **\[R4\]**. This does not correspond to the common geographical emphasis of detention monitoring, which tends to focus on the prison system. 

 A follow\-up study in Georgia in 2019 used the data analysis from the main study to develop an assessment model for national preventive mechanisms \(NPMs\) working against torture **\[R2\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The reach and significance of Dr Carver’s research in relation to influencing and changing policy and practice at national and international levels in particular geographical areas is described below. Other beneficiaries of the research, beyond the people at risk of torture, include NGOs and civil society. Changes in NGO strategies resulting from the research are identified, and influences on civil society in terms of anti\-torture activities are described. 

####  Influence on the policy and practice of the UN and other intergovernmental anti\-torture bodies 

 The finding that detention safeguards have the most impact on reducing the risk of torture is different from the previous understanding of most intergovernmental bodies working on the issue. The main UN treaty bodies have in the past emphasised the prosecution of torturers \(Committee Against Torture, CAT\) or the formation of independent monitoring bodies \(Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, SPT\). Following the publication of *Does Torture Prevention Work?,* the chairs of both these bodies have publicly stated the importance of the research, for example by speaking at the expert panel meeting in New York, as part of the US launch of the book in 2016 \( [http://cendep.blogspot.com/2016/10/cendep\-at\-un\-and\-importance\-of.html](http://cendep.blogspot.com/2016/10/cendep-at-un-and-importance-of.html)\) 

 An internal peer review process \(before external review\) involving several key human rights stakeholders from the UN increased interest in the emerging findings on detention safeguards. Even before the findings were published, Dr Carver and Dr Handley were invited to address the relevant UN committees and the Council of Europe’s European Committee for the Prevention of Torture \(CPT\). They also consulted closely with the then UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Professor Juan Méndez. He launched an initiative at the UN General Assembly to formulate an international protocol on investigative interviewing by police, coinciding with the launch of the book in New York. This initiative is now near completion. While not solely prompted by the research findings, it was influenced by them, and it also emphasises the importance of police procedure in the prevention of torture **\[S4\]**. 

 Both the CAT and SPT have mentioned the Carver/Handley research in their reports. For example, Jens Modvig, CAT Chair, stated when addressing the 71st session of the General Assembly Third Committee \(October 2016\): ‘An effective implementation of fundamental legal safeguards, such as the right to a lawyer, to medical examination and to inform relatives, has recently been highlighted by an important independent research project undertaken under the auspices of the Association for the Prevention of Torture as being the most effective measure to prevent torture and therefore reinforces prior findings of the Committee against Torture in that regard.’ **\[S1\]** The main channel of influence is likely to be the advice that intergovernmental bodies offer to national mechanisms. One national example cited below is Uruguay. 

 These bodies also hold frequent training events. These have included an international seminar hosted by the Danish MFA, the CPT, DIGNITY and the Convention against Torture Initiative \(CTI\) in 2018 – ‘it brought together over twenty members states of the Council of Europe who had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with Carver’s research findings’ **\[S2\]**. Dr Carver gave the keynote speech and the key resource material for the seminar was a CPT discussion paper ‘Combating Torture During Police Custody and Pre\-Trial Detention’, citing the research findings **\[S11, pages 5 and 10\]**. Furthermore, Vice President, European Committee and CAT Chair in their joint statement said: ‘The UN Committee against Torture has benefitted from the evidence, which due to Carver’s research is now at hand, sustaining the efforts to ensure implementation of the fundamental legal safeguards’ **\[S2\]**. 

####  Influence on the policy and practice of national level anti\-torture mechanisms 

 At the end of the research period \(2014\), only two countries in the study had national preventive mechanisms \(NPMs\) under the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture \(OPCAT\): the United Kingdom and Georgia. 

 The chair of the UK NPM describes the research as having influenced the mechanism’s work, allowing ‘those working in field to focus on what works – outcomes and not merely outputs’. He states that he has ‘relied on this publication as a member of the Ministerial Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody and as the Human Rights Advisor to the Northern Ireland Policing Board’ **\[S6\]**. 

 The Georgian NPM, impressed by the multi\-country study, invited Dr Carver and Dr Handley to conduct an independent assessment of its work, funded by a grant from the Open Society Foundation. This assessment used an evaluation tool derived from the underlying research and, according to an NPM head \(Georgia\), ‘outlined some critical areas to be concentrated on to increase the efficiency of the NPM’ **\[S5\]**. 

 Several other countries in the study established NPMs after the end of the research period. The Association for the Prevention of Torture \(APT\) has been an important channel for communicating the research findings to new NPMs in countries such as Chile and the Philippines \(with summaries of the findings circulated in Spanish and Tagalog\), and the SPT has also been an important influence **\[S4\]**. This dissemination of the findings to NPMs also applies to countries *outside* the study. For example, the South\-Eastern Europe group of NPMs, under the leadership of the Croatian NPM, has established a training programme for monitoring of police custody, based on the research findings \(through the influence of APT and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Human Rights, BIM – see below\) **\[S9\]**. Also, in Uruguay, the research findings are explicitly used as the basis for monitoring police custody, as a direct result of the SPT’s engagement with the research **\[S3\]**. 

 Ethiopia is included within the study but is still not party to the OPCAT. The findings of the study have been taken up at a sub\-national level by the Arba Minch University \(AMU\) law school, which provides legal aid services across the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region, one of the most populous areas of the country. AMU, which is in formal partnership with OBU, has modified its legal aid strategy to emphasise the provision of duty lawyers within police lockups, in line with the research findings. 

####  Influence on NGO strategy 

 Several leading NGOs working against torture changed their strategic priorities as a direct result of the research. The first was APT, which commissioned the research. It rewrote its strategic plan to reflect the finding that torture was best prevented by safeguards immediately after arrest. This has since been evidenced by multiple training events stressing the importance of detention safeguards. As discussed above, APT’s role as a mentor and coordinator of NPMs makes this shift in priorities particularly influential **\[S4\]**. 

 DIGNITY is a Copenhagen\-based international NGO that focuses on both legal and medical aspects of anti\-torture work. Senior figures in its management are the chair of CAT and vice\-president of the CPT, which is how they learned of the research. Dr Carver was invited to Copenhagen for several days of consultation with management and staff of DIGNITY, as part of reformulating its strategic plan. Based on the research findings, DIGNITY’s priority in its preventive work ‘has shifted from a predominant focus on the prison sector to include an increased focus on the police sector, notably on monitoring the treatment and conditions of persons in police custody, including on the implementation of fundamental legal safeguards’ **\[S2\]**. 

 The BIM, based in Vienna, established a department focused on torture prevention in 2004 to support the work of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. In 2016 it set up a research programme on the procedural rights of suspects, strongly influenced by the international research project ‘Does Torture Prevention Work?’, and especially the finding that access to procedural safeguards from the first hours of custody is the most effective way to prevent torture. The Carver/Handley research provided a scientific basis for and reinforced the importance of procedural safeguards – not only as components of the right to a fair trial, but also as a measure to prevent torture and other forms of ill\-treatment **\[S9\]**. 

 The London\-based Freedom from Torture \(formerly the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture\) also invited Dr Carver to contribute to an internal discussion on strategy, which has resulted in a new analysis and theory of change driving the organisation’s programming. In 2020, Executive Director said: ‘Ever since your study we have been thinking very deeply about strategies for torture prevention and over the past year or so we have built an analysis and theory of change which we are driving through into programming now’ **\[S10i\]**. This is reflected most strongly in their Strategy 2019\-20 accountability goal – ‘To expose torture in order to strengthen prevention efforts and secure justice and international protection for survivors’ **\[S10ii, page 13\]**. Freedom from Torture is one of the largest torture rehabilitation centres in the world and the only organisation in the UK dedicated to the treatment and rehabilitation of torture survivors, treating 1000\+ people each year. 

####  Encouragement of anti\-torture activity in civil society 

 In the United Kingdom, aside from its influence on the work of the NPM, the research has helped to stimulate civil society activity against torture. The publication of the research was a direct catalyst for the formation of the UK Torture Prohibition Network, a group of scholars, activists and NGOs working in the field **\[S7\]**. The inaugural conference of the network in November 2017 featured a keynote speech by Dr Carver and a discussion about strategies to implement the findings. The network played a crucial role in coordinating the submission of civil society testimony to the UN Committee Against Torture in its periodic review of the UK’s performance in 2019. 

 Another organisation for which the research was a catalyst to further action was Quaker Concern for the Abolition of Torture \(Q\-CAT\), which organised a conference in November 2018 with Dr Carver as keynote speaker. Subsequently Q\-CAT stepped up its engagement with government partners on a variety of issues related to torture and ill\-treatment **\[S8\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Findings from the AHRC\-funded project ‘Re\-presenting para\-sport bodies: Disability and the cultural legacy of the Paralympics’ have been utilised by Channel 4, Paralympics GB, and UK Sport to shape future broadcasting, policy, practice and promotion of para\-sport.  Specifically, drawing on the project’s extensive evidence base, these organisations have given greater emphasis to more representative and broader coverage of disabled people, types of disability, athlete voices and types of para\-sport in their strategic planning, marketing and promotions, and media coverage for Tokyo 2020 and beyond. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 With the rapid commercialisation of the Paralympics and the entry of Channel 4 as rights holder in the UK, the Paralympic Games \- elevated as a sporting mega event \- has become an increasingly important site of disability representation. Silk, Jackson and Pullen undertook the largest ever academic project to examine the implications of the rapid commercialisation of the Paralympic Games and the increasing visibility of \(selected types of\) disability in the media \[R1, R6\]. The project aimed to capture the intentions and practices of Channel 4’s broadcasting of the Rio 2016 Paralympics; the influence of this on the content of Paralympic coverage and mediated forms of disability representation; and the wider impact on public attitudes toward disability. Key research questions included: 

-  How is Paralympic sport produced and what are the dominant representations and meanings ascribed to Para\-athletes through televisual representations? 

-  How do audiences \(those that identify as non\-disabled and disabled\) interpret such meanings? 

-  And how do interpretations influence understandings of disability and disabled people in everyday life? 

 Based on an integrative methodological approach \(including audience focus groups, production interviews, textual analysis and data interpreted by artists in the form of an exhibition\), the evidence highlighted that despite claims that Channel 4’s Paralympic coverage has made disabled bodies more visible, there remain tensions and contradictions within the coverage, as well as discomfort amongst disabled viewers who were found to be much less likely to be engaged with Paralympic coverage than non\-disabled audiences \[R4\]. Specifically: 

-  The study of the practices of senior production staff at Channel 4 revealed that Channel 4’s promotional campaigns and para\-athlete backstories not only marked and rendered disability \(hyper\)visible, but they were narrated with the intention of popularising and making disability ‘sexy’. Questions thus remain over which types of disability are subject to media acclaim. For example, the back\-stories of athletes with cerebral palsy and severe impairments are deemed unsexy, less marketable and less media\-friendly \[R1, R3\]. 

-  The focus of the coverage was on the Paralympic events / athletes deemed to be most ‘accessible’ to audiences. Events where disabled bodies most approximate ableist sporting norms through mobility enhancing technology were ‘hyper\-visible’ in coverage \[R2\]. For example, 50% of coverage was given to swimming and track & field events, while 60% of coverage was given to wheelchair classified athletes; by contrast, some disability classifications gained almost no coverage \[R2\]. 

-  Our survey data helps understand who the Paralympic audience is \[R5\]. Findings suggest they are more likely to be younger, female and non\-disabled, and therefore different to typical sporting audiences. 

-  Our survey and focus group data found that disabled audiences are often critical of Paralympic broadcasting, stating that coverage often puts particular disabilities “on a pedestal” and makes a distinction between disabilities deemed superhuman and those deemed ordinary \[R4\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research findings outlined above have influenced the ways in which Paralympic sport is presented, in particular encouraging more representative coverage of disabled people in the build\-up to and during the Tokyo 2020 Games, which are now due to take place in 2021. 

 The findings of this project were disseminated through a\) a project report for non\-academic stakeholders \[R5\], b\) meetings with Channel 4, Para GB and UK Sport to discuss emergent findings, and c\) an exhibition featuring artistic interpretations of the research data held in London in July 2019 \[E1, E2\]. The exhibition was attended by representatives from Paralympics GB, UK Sport, Sport England and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, as well as executives from Channel 4. 

####  Shaping broadcast coverage within the UK 

 Channel 4, who will broadcast the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games in 2021, have made it clear that BU research will “underpin… future coverage of the Paralympics” \[E3\] and that the coverage will “embrace a wider spectrum of disabilities within para\-sport coverage”, implementing our recommendations \[R1, R2\]. 

 A film from the opening night of the exhibition \[E2\] was used by Channel 4 “as a provocation at the first meeting of the creative team”, resulting in, “a key change of emphasis in the marketing for Tokyo 2020 \- as a result of the research \- \[which\] was a shift in how we will focus on elements of the athletes lives as sports people and humans” \[E3\]. This move away from their portrayal of Paralympians as ‘superhuman’, draws directly on BU’s research which showed that this labelling was particularly problematic amongst disabled audiences \[R4\]. Based on the team’s recommendations \[R5\], Channel 4 have “engaged in dialogue with disability advocates, policy makers and disability rights groups with regard to how disabled people would like to be represented”, in order to shape coverage of Tokyo 2020 \[E3\]. 

####  Shaping Para\-sport policy, practice and marketing 

 Paralympics GB, the governing body for the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team at the Paralympics, states that the “insights provided from the data … have framed the decisions we have made for Tokyo in 2021 and beyond” \[E4\]. In particular, the research has: 

-  “informed the development of our new corporate strategy to focus more on athlete voice, which we identified as enabling the organisation to enhance its authenticity and credibility and allow Paralympics GB athletes to talk about wider social issues” \[E4\]. 

-  “supported our desire to incorporate a wider range of disabilities \(beyond those that are most visible\) in this marketing campaign and utilise athlete voice to drive social change” \[E4\]. 

-  Encouraged Paralympics GB to showcase “a wider range of sports, impairments and diversity – particularly with regards to BAME athletes” during Tokyo 2020 coverage \[E4\]. 

-  Directly informed Paralympics GB’s marketing strategy for the 2021 Paralympics, \[E4\], drawing on project data which highlights the young and female audience for the Games \[R5\]. 

-  Encouraged Paralympics GB to focus their Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) for Tokyo 2020 around “increased public awareness of Paralympics GB athletes” and an improvement in “positive attitudes to disabled people” \[E4\]. 

####  Providing an evidence **base** for sport policy in the UK 

 In February 2019 BU collaborated with UK Sport to develop the UK Sport Public Attitudes Survey, focusing on public attitudes towards para\-sport, the Paralympics, and media coverage of such events. The research team’s analysis of the initial results has helped shape UK Sport’s approach to parasport events, enabling them to “explore territory that we had never specifically entered into before and enhanced our knowledge accordingly” \[E5\]. 

 Silk, Jackson and Pullen later presented their broader research findings to a UK Sport all\-staff session in February 2020, which: 

-  “informed the way \[UK Sport\] communicate regarding issues of para\-sport … In particular, it is supporting our attempts to encourage the media to cover a broader spectrum of disabilities and parasport events” \[E5\]. This draws on our research highlighting a need for a broader representation of disabilities / events, as some disabled audiences feel current coverage does not represent them effectively \[R1, R2, R4\]. 

-  “help\[ed\] to shape our communications strategy for the Tokyo Paralympic Games, … particularly in the audience demographics that we will seek to engage” \[E5\]. Specifically, UK Sport will now target a younger, female audience, drawing on BU’s finding that para\-sport is more popular amongst these groups \[R5\]. 

-  Supported UK Sport to “make a stronger case for increased funding from government” for para\-sports \[E5\], drawing on the team’s evidence for both the popularity and progressive impact of watching para\-sport \[R5\]. 

-  Made “an invaluable contribution to a proposed new induction programme for those coming into Paralympic sport and to the enhanced support being developed for disabled athletes transitioning out of sport” \[E5\]. 

-  Influenced diversity and inclusion \(D&I\) policy, particularly from our finding that there was a lack of racial and ethnic diversity across featured para\-athletes during the Rio 2016 coverage \[R5\]. “The research has landed at a particularly opportune moment in UK Sport’s development in that, building on the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement, we have recently restated our commitment to the whole area of diversity and inclusion – i.e. to tackling racism in British sport; to implementing a far more ambitious internal D&I plan; and to driving forward D&I within our new strategy” \[E5\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Northumbria University’s researchers and pedagogic experts co\-created inclusive, interactive, public engagement workshops that bring together children, teachers, and families to experience engineering research first\-hand. Between 2014\-2020, these interactive workshops were delivered to 94,821 children and 17,974 families, carers, and teachers in 34 primary schools from less\-affluent areas in the North East of England. The researchers tracked the specific effect on a sample size of 372 students by comparing 2017 data with a 2015 baseline. Data show children became more willing to pursue engineering careers \(increasing from 25.6% to 33.1%\) with the biggest effect on young girls \(70.6% expressed an aversion to engineering careers before the interventions, 47.1% afterwards\). Northumbria’s specific public engagement approach has been adopted by Gateshead and Derby Further Education Colleges to increase women’s enrolment on their construction apprenticeship programmes \(from 8% to 23%, and from 0% to 39%, respectively\); by North Tyneside Combined Authority to develop their Adult Education initiatives; by Museums Northumberland to enhance their community education and STEM participation in schools; and has expanded to 50 schools in Nigeria to improve learning and participation in science subjects, especially for young girls.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The North East of England has a significant engineering\-skills challenge with poor progression into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics \(STEM\) careers. Children from primary schools in less\-affluent areas and/or with protected characteristics are especially disadvantaged and see limited routes into STEM\-based careers and little use in studying STEM subjects. To address this, Northumbria University’s Smart Materials and Surfaces Laboratory \(SMSL\) and Renewable Energy Technology and Materials \(RETM\) research groups delivered interactive workshops providing hands\-on experience of their engineering research to excite interest and raise awareness of STEM opportunities and careers. This was funded using two approaches: 

-  **Start\-up funding:** In 2014, Northumbria Engineering staff led a successful GBP1,200,000 bid to the Higher Education Funding Council for England which led to the creation of NUSTEM \(Northumbria University: STEM\) – a team of specialist public engagement staff who work with North East primary schools and other external partners to deliver a public engagement programme to support children’s progression into STEM careers. 

-  **Long\-term sustainability:** to support NUSTEM long\-term, SMSL and RETM used funding from their EPSRC grants by designing suitable public engagement resources into their Pathways to Impact sections \(see successful grant details in Section 3\). 

 Over the REF2021 period, NUSTEM acted as a vehicle to deliver engineering research to a wide audience through a sustained public engagement programme. Since the funding to support NUSTEM came, in part, from EPSRC grants, the proviso was that the public engagement had to be based on the funded research and draw materially and distinctly upon it. Thus, outreach materials – for example workshop demonstrations in schools to expose children to visually exciting, hands\-on experiences of engineering research – were created and underpinned by specific examples of key research outputs produced within the Unit, and from the body of research carried out within the Unit. Exemplars of this underpinning research are: 

-  **Liquid droplet manipulation:** McHale and Ledesma\-Aguilar used electrical fields to control liquids that can be manipulated from a droplet to spread into shaped films, such as a ring or a star shape, and then be retracted smoothly back into a droplet \[ **R1**\]. McHale and Wells used smart super\-heating arrays that part vaporise the droplet so that it ‘levitates’ fractionally above the surface to enhance control of the droplet’s movement \[ **R2**\]. Wells and Ledesma\-Aguilar used oil\-impregnated surfaces to create an ‘ultra\-smooth layer’ to allow evaporation to be controlled and performed predictably \[ **R3**\]. 

-  **Cost\-effective novel materials:** Barrioz’s, Beattie’s and Zoppi’s work on nanoparticle ink\-based solar cells has led to the development of efficient, cost\-effective flexible solar cells \[ **R4**\]. Identifying and addressing environmental and sustainability issues, such as solar power and the use of materials to increase energy\-efficiency, are topics which young people engage with and identify as significant and ethical challenges for their lifetimes. 

 Alongside development of the interactive activities, beginning in 2014, SMSL, RETM, and NUSTEM co\-designed a unique public engagement approach: the engineering\-based ‘Theory of Change’, which is designed to inspire children’s engagement with STEM education and careers \[ **R5**\]. The Theory of Change approach acknowledged and addressed the issue that children’s confidence and interest in STEM is influenced by their experiences of STEM from an early age \(primary education level\) and the perspectives of people around them \(teachers, parents\). The public engagement programme was delivered in partnership with schools and parents to inspire children to see different possibilities in STEM and new potential in themselves \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. The workshops revealed how exposing young people to the creativity, variety and application of engineering research expands their awareness of the opportunities available and the importance of delivering these interventions at a key age \(primary\-level\) to maximise STEM aspirations \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. The integration of disciplinary and pedagogic research led to the formal Theory of Change model, providing the theoretical underpinnings and context for the complex mix of interventions necessary to lead to a significant change in the number and diversity of those choosing STEM careers. The Theory of Change demonstrates the potential of making engineering accessible, interactive, and exciting to kindle and catalyse children’s interest in STEM subjects and careers.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 NUSTEM provided a vehicle to engage the public with Northumbria’s engineering research. Hands on workshops underpinned by engineering research were created to inspire children’s interest in STEM careers. The programme’s success led to increased interest in STEM careers among primary school children, modified teacher training, and revised curriculum in schools attended by some of the least\-affluent children in the UK. The Theory of Change approach was adopted by organisations from across North East England and primary schools in Nigeria as part of their efforts to enhance diversity in STEM education and inspire STEM\-led economic development, underpinning improved learning and participation for enhanced social welfare. 

 **4.1 Improved STEM learning and participation in primary school children from less\-affluent areas in the North East of England** 

 Between 2014 and 2020, interactive workshops used the Theory of Change model to showcase engineering research. They were delivered to 94,821 children in 34 partner primary schools from groups under\-represented in STEM education and careers, such as girls and children from less\-affluent areas in North East England \(primary schools were recruited on the percentage of children that received free school meals; a widely used proxy for identifying schools in areas with low socioeconomic status\). These workshops included participation from 17,947 families, carers, and teachers in the partner primary schools \[ **E1**, p4, p7\]. Demonstration kits \(developed from EPSRC\-funded projects\) for use with primary school children, delivered by engineering researchers and the NUSTEM team, were utilised to explain concepts such as smart materials, surfaces, shape memory materials, levitation, nanoparticle inks, and solar energy. Supplemented by university visits, work\-experience week, and Scientist of the Week activities, NUSTEM research\-led workshops broadened children’s understanding of STEM careers. 

 The researchers tracked the specific effect on a sample size of 372 students by gathering baseline data in 2015 and, after benefiting from sustained engagement through ‘Theory of Change’ workshops, compared it to data in 2017. The data show that engineering careers had the largest increase in the response ‘ *would like to do*’ from **25.6% to 33.1%** in comparison with other STEM options such as ‘astronaut’ and ‘games tester’ \[ **E2**, p11\]. Furthermore, examining preferences by gender revealed that boys’ responses to ‘ *would like to do’* engineering rose from 32.1% \(in 2015\) to 59.0% \(in 2017\), boys’ responses to ‘ *would NOT like to do*’ engineering fell from 55.6% \(in 2015\) to 25.3% \(in 2017\) and the responses to ‘ *Not sure*’ were 12.3% \(in 2015\) and 15.7% \(in 2017\) \[ **E2**, p13\]. For girls, the ‘ *would like to do’* engineering response rose from 20.0% \(in 2015\) to 21.8% \(in 2017\). However, girls’ responses to ‘ *would NOT like to do*’ engineering fell from **70.6% \(in 2015\) to 47.1% \(in 2017\)**, and responses to ‘ *Not sure*’ increased from 9.4% \(in 2015\) to 31.0% \(2017\). This demonstrated that the engineering workshops have a more pronounced effect on young girls and showed a clear shift away from closing off the option of an engineering career \[ **E2**, p13\]. Indicative quotes from follow\-up evaluations include Julia Bourne, STEM coordinator at New York Primary School \(North Shields\) who states: ‘ *NUSTEM has helped us hugely in raising aspirations in science and STEM … Because of the effect of NUSTEM we are seeing more and more boys’ and girls’ aspirations heading towards STEM careers’* \[ **E1**, p18; **E3**\]. 

 **4.2 Revised curriculum and teaching practice in primary schools in North East of England** 

 The use of engineering research illustrated and enlivened the imaginations of children, enabling them to express and explore their interest in their own way \[ **E1**, p23\]. Incorporating parents and active collaboration in hands\-on experiences with teachers fostered a supportive environment where children feel empowered to state and pursue interest in STEM subjects \[ **E1**, p17\]. Building on this, schools have revised their curricula to adopt the Theory of Change approach of using ‘ *family workshops*’ and ‘ *more practical teaching of science*’ to stimulate and sustain interest in STEM subjects and careers \[ **E1**, p17\-20\]. The curriculum changes have been focused on linking STEM subjects to career opportunities through NUSTEM’s Primary Careers Tool, an online STEM jobs database where jobs are linked to science subjects and designed to support primary school teachers to easily embed relevant careers as part of their regular classroom teaching \[ **E1**, p20\]. Indicative quotes from follow\-up evaluations explain that the ‘ *tool gives me exactly what I need, in the most straightforward way possible. There are no distractions or extraneous information so I can use it routinely in my lessons*’ and that the ‘ *Primary Careers Tool has been instrumental in helping us to implement a careers drive through the curriculum*’ \[ **E1**, p20\-21\]. 

 The Ogden Trust, a charity promoting physics education to disadvantaged school children across England, adopted NUSTEM’s Primary Careers Tool. In 2018 and 2019, 402 teachers from 296 schools across England received training from the Ogden Trust which includes use of the Primary Careers Tool. The Ogden Trust’s National Teaching and Learning Lead confirms: ‘ *The Primary Careers Tool is an excellent addition to the primary teacher training that we offer at the Ogden Trust… It's taken real expertise to develop a tool that allows large numbers of classroom teachers to broaden the careers language and ambition of their students*’ \[ **E1**, p21\]. 

 **4.3 Enhanced learning and participation for adult education and community engagement through regional organisations in the North East of England** 

 NUSTEM was one of three finalists shortlisted for the 7th Airbus GEDC Diversity Award in 2020 \[ **E4**\], and the Theory of Change and its approaches have been adopted by other organisations for STEM public engagement and enhancing regional social welfare. The BRIDGE \(Building Routes Into Degrees with Greater Equality\) project is a research collaboration between Northumbria, and Gateshead and Derby Colleges, to examine the lack of diversity in enrolment on construction degrees and careers. The BRIDGE project adapted the Theory of Change to create greater diversity in construction access programmes and careers. Gateshead College runs a successful apprenticeship programme where employer/educator partnerships give students a salary, a professional qualification, and a guaranteed job opportunity \[ **E5**, p9\]. However, in 2016 **only 8%** of participants were women \[ **E5**, p52\]. Through the NUSTEM workshop model to raise awareness with potential applicants at local schools, International Women’s Day events, ‘ *Construction Weeks’* offering interactive workshops for those aged 14\-24, and pop\-up community engagement events, this was **increased to 23%** in 2018 \[ **E5**, p18\-21, p52\]. This success encouraged NUSTEM to expand the project to Derby College, the 14th largest Further Education college in England \(with 4500 aged 16\-18, 10,000 adult students, and 2,000 apprentices\) but in the 55th most\-deprived local authority, with 32% of the student population living in deprived wards, and above average BAME student populations \[ **E5**, p10\]. Derby College had **zero women** in construction apprenticeships in 2016, but, after the Theory of Change engagement model was applied with the same events and interactive workshops, the 2018 student cohort for construction apprenticeships **was 39% female** \[ **E5**, p43\]. 

 The engineering\-based Theory of Change model has also been adopted by the North of Tyne Combined Authority’s \(NTCA\) STEM and Digital Skills programme to address the STEM skills gap in adult populations \[ **E6**\]. The NTCA covers Newcastle, Northumberland, and North Tyneside local authorities \(approximately 880,000 population, home to over 23,000 businesses, and a local economy estimated at GBP17,000,000,000\). The NTCA Strategy Manager explains: ‘ *Theory of Change shaped the engagement practice of our outreach work’* and ‘ *was also useful in shaping the commission for an external evaluation of the STEM and Digital Skills programme, thus shaping the means by which we measure success of this initiative*… *Northumbria University has enabled the combined authority to achieve a significant milestone’* \[ **E6**\]. 

 Broadening out into public education programmes, Museums Northumberland, an independent charity providing the museums service for four museums and two historical sites across Northumberland, have adopted the Theory of Change model in their education and teacher support work. The CEO of Museums Northumberland confirms the use of ‘ *engineering research conducted at Northumbria University to inspire interest ... \[and\] to demonstrate the exciting findings of their work in an inclusive and participatory way’* \[ **E7**\]. The CEO also confirms that by ‘ *using the NUSTEM Theory of Change model as an important element of the community value and public education case, Museums Northumberland won a GBP3,140,000 National Lottery Heritage Fund award to create the Union Chain Bridge STEM Learning Programme’* \[ **E7**\]. This aspect of the Union Chain Bridge project has a focus *‘to address the many issues currently facing STEM, such as the national skills crisis, and misleading media portrayals of STEM professionals, particularly with respect to female roles in careers*’ \[ **E8**\]. 

 **4.4 Expanding STEM learning and participation through educational opportunity in Nigeria** 

 Engineering\-based workshops and the Theory of Change approach to sustained engagement from teachers and parents have been delivered by Northumbria researchers and the NUSTEM team working directly with 50 schools in Ekiti State, Nigeria, to give hands\-on experience of engineering research and STEM careers to these children \[ **E9**\]. The Headteacher of Total Child School explains that ‘ *Scientist of the week material helped me to show real people and introduce science skills*’ to ‘ *bring science concepts to life’* and *‘has positively impacted on how pupils in my classrooms view science*’ \[ **E10**\]. Finally, the Headteacher of the Amazing Grace Schools Group explains ‘ *Prior to our involvement with NUSTEM, the teaching materials our teachers used were often gender\-biased, now teachers are more conscious of the type of materials and the importance of using role models in teaching science. This in turn has resulted in girls knowing that they can study science and that science is for them*’ \[ **E11**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 **Harradine**’s practice research is conducted through the cross\-disciplinary arts company Fevered Sleep, of which he is co\-artistic director, and integrates creative practices, participation, and innovative approaches to partnerships, public engagement, and touring in order to bring about social change. Focusing on ‘difficult’ issues through sustained collaboration with cultural organisations, local authories, communities, and individuals, Harradine’s research has generated the following impacts: 

1.  Engaging diverse and marginalised audiences; 

1.  Enhancing cultural understanding through the exploration of difficult subjects in social contexts that facilitate conversation and exchange; 

1.  Changing practices and policies within partner organisations; 

1.  Contributing to the shaping of policy debates. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **Harradine**’s practice research since he joined Central in 2012 has focused substantially upon questions of widening and deepening participation in the arts, in collaboration with partners and with impact built into the research design. From 2011–2015, he led a four\-year practice research project called *Future Play* \(RO3\), focused on developing models for touring performance for young audiences. This project, supported by Paul Hamlyn Foundation and Arts Council England, challenged the conventional ‘parachute model’ for touring, in which performance programming is governed principally by commercial sales targets, and connections with local partners, audiences, and participants are brief and truncated. Although this reduces costly time spent at each venue, it also minimises engagement between artists, venues, and audiences, and privileges existing audiences over those not already engaged in the arts. Instead, *Future Play* began to develop alternative and sustainable touring strategies, such as bespoke networked partnerships, local engagement at each venue, and the integration of processes of artistic and audience development. 

 To extend this enquiry, **Harradine** developed a further practice research project, *Men & Girls Dance* \( *M&GD*, RO2\), in 2015. Between 2015 and 2019, 10 iterations of the project were created, with partners including Quarterhouse, Folkestone; Lawrence Batley Theatre, Huddersfield; The Lowry, Salford; Dance4, Nottingham; Southeast Dance and Attenborough Centre, Brighton & Hove; The Place and Tate Britain, London; and Skånes Dansteater, Malmö, Sweden. The project addressed and challenged the overwhelmingly negative media and social representations of relationships between men and girls, with the interconnected aims to ‘propose positive, embodied narratives of care, playfulness and trust between men and children’, and to develop ‘new approaches to performance touring in the UK’ \(RO2: 8\). The methodology involved the creation of a dance performance and ‘contextual materials’, and ‘close work with a network of partner organisations to conceive and deliver new approaches to collaboration, participation, touring and audience development’ \(RO2: 13\). This innovation enabled the process of proposing alternative narratives for relationships between men and children to be developed iteratively through a socially engaged approach both to rehearsal processes and touring. This was achieved through re\-creation at each venue with a cast comprised partly of local girls, thus engaging local communities in the research. Alongside this, extended and collaborative audience development activities were organised around the project’s ‘contextual materials’ \(a newspaper revised and published at each venue — with contributions from local people — and discussions curated in a ‘Talking Place’ around performances\). Bespoke networks of local partners supported the development of these activities, facilitating knowledge exchange both among partners and with wider communities. The project found that dance, as an embodied form, is highly effective as a medium for exploring this subject, but also that ‘It is insufficient to presume, with a subject as charged as men’s relationships with children, that performance alone can articulate the complexity of alternative narratives to those who encounter it’, and that the newspaper and ‘Talking Place’ proved ‘highly effective tool\[s\] for extending the inquiry of the performance into forms that are widely and more readily accessible to diverse audiences and members of the public’ \(RO2: 36\). 

 External evaluation of *M&GD* \(Morris Hargreaves Macintyre Ltd\) raised further questions about how to broaden and deepen the aims to ‘develop audiences and to provoke thinking and discussion’ \(S1: 53\). This informed the development of the practice research project *This Grief Thing* \( *TGT*, 2016–2021, RO1\). From September 2018–October 2019, 5 iterations of the project were delivered with local partners in Preston, Middlesborough, Manchester \(at the Whitworth Art Gallery and SICK\! Festival\), and Nottingham. *TGT* aimed to develop strategies for enabling conversations about the complex issue of grieving and the social and cultural prohibitions that surround it; making it visible in public spaces; and building resilience among individuals, families, and communities in the face of grief \(RO1: 10\). Historically, grief has often been publicly marked, woven into social relations, structures, and events, and *TGT* explored ways of reviving and reinventing lost practices of grieving to make it visible and acceptable in contemporary society. This took the form of a collection of clothing and accessories, sold in temporary shops opened at each of its touring locations. The collection and these shop installations were developed through a review of medical, psychological, therapeutic, and cultural research on processes of grieving, alongside collaborations with academic experts in these fields, as well as public focus groups on grief and the many ways in which it can be experienced and articulated. This inquiry exposed an absence of provision of non\-therapeutic and non\-medical spaces for discussing grief and led to the development of the focus groups into ‘Grief Gatherings’, bringing together up to 12 people for a 90\-minute conversation about grief as a key methodology for both participatory research and dissemination of the project’s findings \(RO1: 18\). The research found that cultural practices such as performance and literature are not best placed to reintegrate grief into ordinary social relations \(since such practices, in their stylised explorations of themes of grief and death, further separate these from the everyday\). Instead, the research has demonstrated that participatory ‘practices of everyday life’ \(clothing, shopping, conversation\) provide an effective approach for enabling people to come together to talk, think, and learn about grief \(RO1: 30\). Furthermore, the ‘cluster models’ for partnerships developed by the project were shown to be particularly effective in engaging diverse groups of people in conversations about grief, because participants recognised and trusted the local organisations within the cluster \(RO1: 31\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 As a result of **Harradine**’s close collaboration with partners and his focus on developing innovative artistic practices that engage audiences and participants in explorations of difficult social issues, his work has led directly to the following impacts: 

1.  Engaging diverse and marginalised audiences; 

1.  Enhancing cultural understanding through the exploration of difficult subjects in social contexts that facilitate conversation and exchange; 

1.  Changing practices and policies within partner organisations; 

1.  Contributing to the shaping of policy debates. 

 **Engaging diverse and marginalised audiences** 

 Fevered Sleep’s practice in relation to diversity is recognised as ‘strong’ by Arts Council England: ‘The organisation understands and is responsive to challenges and barriers facing members of the protected characteristic groups in engaging in the sector. The creative case \[for diversity\] is embedded across all aspects of the programme and a key driver for informing and shaping the artistic programme’ \(S9: 7\). Harradine’s practice research in *M&GD* and *TGT* has led this process by generating forms of artistic expression with multiple, interconnected mechanisms for engagement and participation: in the first instance, by developing ‘contextual materials’ which wrapped around the dance performance at each venue \(the newspaper and ‘Talking Place’\), and, in the second, through the development of innovative practice to deliver the aims of the project. As a result, Harradine and Fevered Sleep have successfully engaged diverse and marginalised audiences across the UK and in Europe. By August 2019, the 10 versions of *M&GD* had generated 81 performances, engaging 11,600 people as participants and audiences \(RO2: 29–31\), including a residency at Skånes Dansteater in Malmö, Sweden as well as further planned commissions that had to be cancelled due to the COVID\-19 pandemic \(RO2: 5\). To date, *TGT* has completed 5 residencies \(2018–2019\), with 3,440 people visiting the shops and 341 people participating in ‘Grief Gatherings’, including a programme of online gatherings in 2020, subsequent to the project residencies \(RO1: 29–30\). Project evaluations show that *M&GD*’s 2016 tour played to 89% of its full audience capacity, of which ‘an impressive 14% were brand new to contemporary dance’ \(S1: 6\), ‘over a third \(37%\) of those surveyed had never been to the respective venue before’ \(S1: 7\), and ‘10% of audience \[were\] from areas of low engagement’ with the arts \(S1: 50\). This engagement with diverse and marginalised audiences was delivered through collaborative, local engagements: each two\-week rehearsal process with local performers created opportunities to engage their families and for volunteer ‘community catalysts’ to link the project into existing, local networks to promote interest in and engagement with it \(S1: 20\). The success of these mechanisms for engaging audiences in a creative form they had not previously engaged with fed into the development of *TGT*, which focused specifically on marginalised participants through iterations exclusively in places in the top 100 locations on the Index of Multiple Deprivation \(S9: 7\). Participants came from 38 different Local Authorities, with almost 50% of visitors coming from those ranking in the top 20% of most deprived areas in the country \(S2: 16\). In all, 13% of respondents giving feedback identified as BAME \(the average for the populations of the areas visited was 12%\) and 22% identified as LGBTQIA\+, substantially higher than the national average of 6.8% in 2017 \(S2: 21 and ONS data\). 

 **Enhancing cultural understanding through the exploration of difficult subjects in social contexts that facilitate conversation and exchange** 

 Through forms as varied as dance, clothing, printed materials, and conversation, these projects enhanced cultural understanding of difficult social issues. In *M&GD*, a newspaper was published about the project and its context at each venue, with contributions sourced locally, described by one partner as ‘an excellent mechanism for starting a conversation on the theme and a brilliant resource that is very useful for teachers/safeguarding officers \[...\] dance practitioners working with young people’ \(S1: 28\). Community members were also engaged via ‘The Talking Place’, a series of drop\-in safe spaces ‘for the public to discuss the project’s themes’ through facilitated conversations both in community locations and before and after performances \(S1: 4\). Evidencing the capacity of the performance and its contextual materials to enhance understanding of the project’s difficult subject, a local councillor stated that ‘The way the piece gradually dispelled any misgivings about men dancing with young girls was phenomenal. I was totally drawn in and at the end completely related to all on stage’ \(S1: 15\); likewise, theatre critic Lyn Gardner wrote: ‘At the end, children and adults stand side by side at the front of the stage and look out at us with a steady gaze. They have banished the monsters, and made us see something different: the joy. It’s touching, in every way’ \(S11\). 

 The shop installations for *TGT* were also developed to generate opportunities for participation and conversation, engaging people with the difficult subject of grief in a setting that is ordinary, unthreatening, and familiar \(unlike arts spaces such as galleries and theatres which many people do not and will not attend\). Members of the public were also invited to join ‘Grief Gatherings’ in the shop after closing time, described by one partner as ‘very much needed. People don’t have a public space where they can talk about grief and death’ \(S3: 6\), and by another as ‘a beautiful space for sharing hard experiences with one another’ \(S3: 56\). Participants attested to their own enhanced understanding of grief: ‘I found it a really positive experience where everyone got to contribute and many insights were provided \[…\] it made me feel that grieving is allowed and normal\!’, ‘Breaking the taboo is really helpful — made me feel comforted’ \(S3: 51, 52\); ‘it helped to unlock something that I didn’t even realise was trapped inside of me’, ‘it’s very rare indeed for me to find an opportunity just to have someone hear me’, ‘ *This Grief Thing* has changed my life because it’s changed me’ \(S8: 02:34, 03:55, 05:50\). The project also widened its impact on cultural understandings of grief and grieving through extensive press engagement at national, regional, and local levels, including features on BBC Radio 5 Live \(almost 5m listeners each week\) and the i newspaper \(online and print circulation 248,230 monthly\), as well as local television and press \(S2: 17\). 

 **Changing practices and policies within partner organisations** 

 Partner organisations report that their practices have changed as a result of collaborating with Harradine and Fevered Sleep, with some sustaining specific aspects of Harradine’s approach within their own organisations. Louisa Davies, an independent producer formerly of the Midlands Arts Centre \(MAC\), acknowledges that 

 By building a convincing body of evidence around a series of high\-quality performance pieces, Fevered Sleep’s work through *Future Play* undoubtedly impacted on and changed my \(and MAC’s\) approach to programming and producing performance for children. We changed our approach to tour bookings from one\-off performances to longer residencies; integrated creative activities at MAC \(such as workshops\) with strategic audience development initiatives; and developed new ways to work in partnership with primary schools. \(S10\) 

 Partners also confirmed more indirect influences on their organisational practice. Following collaboration with Harradine on *TGT*, one host organisation remarked that ‘our space is now being used in a different way — we have pop ups happening in it all the time — the project sparked a different way for us to use the space’ \(S3: 64\), and David Tuffnell, Middlesbrough Town Council’s Arts Development Officer, testifies to changes to practices within his own organisation evident in ‘a whole new approach to the use of retail spaces in the town \(which has also enabled the development of new ways of working in partnership with one of the town shopping centres\), and the reimagining of retail spaces as civic spaces’ \(S5\). The project evaluation notes that further new partnerships have been generated through collaboration with Harradine: ‘two of the partner organisations are now collaborating with artists in delivering social and palliative care’ \(S3: 79\), and Tuffnell states that the project initiated a sustained conversation about how Middlesbrough’s Culture and Arts, and Health teams can work together \(S3: 66\), resulting in ‘an Arts and Health group for Middlesbrough’ \(S5\). Attesting to changes in his own individual approach, he writes ‘As a contributor to the development of a strategy for this group, I have drawn directly on learning taken from *This Grief Thing* and the council’s work with Fevered Sleep’ \(S5\). He goes on to explain still wider organisational changes to the practices of Middlesbrough Town Council relating to partnership working that have developed directly from their collaboration with Harradine: 

 Working with Fevered Sleep provided a context that facilitated partnership building in the town \(for example with local organisations Ageing Better and Public Health\). This process led directly to an ongoing working relationship with these organisations, but also, importantly, to a new way of thinking about partnership working, and the necessity to create ties with other, specialist organisations when working in community settings. This process, modelled by Fevered Sleep’s approach to touring and presenting *This Grief Thing*, relies on collaborating organisations mutually embedding their work, strategy and practice, an approach we continue to pursue. \(S5\) 

 Harradine’s influence on the practices and policies of the wider arts sector is evidenced by the Co\-Creative Director of SICK\! Festival, who states that his engagement with *This Grief Thing* ‘has helped me formulate this idea of “subject as practice” \[...\] where the artist starts with the subject and everything comes from that. It has an integrity when the form is driven entirely by the subject. Fevered Sleep and this project have been influential in how I’ve ended up framing this idea when I talk about it \[...\] It’s been formative in my thinking’ \(S3: 65\). Likewise, Moira Sinclair, Chief Executive of Paul Hamlyn Foundation testifies that Harradine’s practice research ‘has undoubtedly had an impact on the sector, leading to change in practices of both touring companies and receiving venues: touring companies have used the evidence from *Future Play* to bolster confidence to take artistic risks and create innovative work; programming/presenting venues have been able to take more risks in programming and make bolder programming choices, as *Future Play* has strongly evidenced the success of this approach’ \(S4\). Harradine’s success in audience engagement and practices involving local communities led to his 2018 appointment to the Board of Directors and Artist Advisory Group of Yorkshire Dance, one of the UK regional dance development agencies. The organisation’s CEO and Artistic Director reports that insights from Harradine’s practice research have 

 fundamentally impacted on Yorkshire Dance’s strategic thinking, organisational development, practice and policy when it comes to equality, diversity and inclusion. As a direct result of David’s work in this area, we have made changes to our recruitment processes and policies; we have introduced new systems to support marginalised trustees when they join the board; we have revised the recruitment policy and membership of the artist advisory group, and we have changed how we reach, engage and work with independent artists \[…\] Drawing on the knowledge he has developed through his research with Fevered Sleep, he has consistently reminded Yorkshire Dance that this commitment is not an absolute set of actions, but a dynamic process undertaken by a group of people. \(S6\) 

 **Contributing to the shaping of policy debates** 

 Harradine’s practice research in *This Grief Thing* has led to his contribution to policy debates on grief and bereavement. In recognition of his research and impact, he was invited in early 2019 to join the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on bereavement support, representing Fevered Sleep, who are the only arts organisation in the group. The group’s secretariat, The Good Grief Trust \(the UK’s umbrella organisation for bereavement charities and related organisations\), contributes to government policy on bereavement and developed National Grief Awareness Week 2020. The Trust has testified to Harradine’s impact on policy debate: ‘Fevered Sleep was the key arts partner for this project, galvanising major cultural institutions across the UK \(including the National Theatre and Imperial War Museums\) to engage in awareness\-raising activities to highlight the need for high level government action on bereavement support’ \(S7\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Lymphoedema affects over 200,000 people in the UK, and approximately 2 in 10 breast cancer sufferers and 5 in 10 people with vulval cancer worldwide. Our research has provided the Welsh Government \(WG\) and clinicians with accurate estimates based on original evidence of the economic burden of lymphoedema and the cost savings derived from more efficient approaches to assessing and managing lymphoedema in patients in primary and secondary care. The Lymphoedema Network Wales \(LNW\) used our data to lobby for GBP1,400,000 from the WG to deploy a new service to be rolled out across Wales that included extending the On the Ground Education Programme \(OGEP\) and the ‘Wet Leg’ Pathway \(WLP\). Our findings have since shown estimated cost savings of up to GBP24,460,000 per year from the new service. Our research has played a critical role in 1\) evidence\-based policy changes, 2\) improving the management of chronic lymphoedema for patients and practitioners by supporting the implementation of cost\-effective programmes, and 3\) increasing the economic impact of improved clinical care. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In 2014, LNW asked the Swansea Centre for Health Economics \(SCHE\) to conduct an economic analysis of the All\-Wales Lymphoedema Service. This came from previous work on economic burden of wound management that Humphreys had conducted **\[R1\]**. Patients with lymphedema have significantly increased risk of wound formation. This can occur due to infection, moisture build\-up and fungal infection in skin folds, as well as trauma. Therefore, good skin, wound care and compliance with compression are all important factors to reducing risk of developing further complications. This work showed that wounds generate a considerable economic burden for the NHS **\[R1\]** and that chronic wounds related to lymphoedema are a major contributor to the problem. A rapid evidence assessment review conducted by Humphreys et al **\[R2\]** showed that lifestyle factors, co\-morbidities, demographics, deprivation, and current service provision affected lymphoedema service providers and patients. These affected factors related to Health\-Related Quality of Life \(HRQoL\) and NHS resource utilisation. Using economic evaluation methodologies, Humphreys and Fitzsimmons analysed resource utilisation from 6 months before to 6 months after entry into the LNW’s new lymphoedema service and showed significant economic savings for the NHS \(GBP2,424 per patient per year\) compared to the costs of wound management in a hypothetical ‘world without’ scenario \[ **R3\]**. The LNW continued to work with Humphreys on an economic analysis of other aspects of the lymphoedema service, including the new OGEP. LNW developed the OGEP \(2015 – 2016\) as a community\-based education model involving the use of video prescription applications and an educator training programme to support community health professionals and patients in the management and care of chronic oedema. The WLP was developed as part of the OGEP. Before the OGEP, each Welsh Health Board \(WHB\) had its own system for managing lymphoedema, and these systems were not value\- or evidence\-based or cost effective. Therefore, a single\-arm study \(with no comparator\) based on an observational ‘before\-after’ design was conducted with 100 patients in the OGEP **\[R4\]**. In a review of the direct costs associated with the OGEP, the largest difference between baseline and the three\-month follow\-up review was a reduction in the frequency of district nurse \(DN\) home visits \(53%\), which resulted in more cost\-effective service delivery **\[R4\]**. Furthermore, there was a large difference in the costs of dressings, which decreased from GBP52,419 at baseline to GBP19,667 \(63%\) when the OGEP was utilised **\[R4\]**. There was also a statistically significant improvement in the patients’ EQ\-5D\-5L utility scores and visual analogue scale scores, which indicated an increase in the patient’s perceived quality of life \(QoL\). Our research showing the economic benefits of the OGEP and the WLP across the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board \(CVUHB\).  Our work was cited as the only economic analysis source in the updated clinical guidelines for the WLP created by the LNW **\[R4\]**. 

 Davies and Watts also qualitatively examined the effect of the OGEP on clinicians by conducting focus groups and found that the OGEP enhanced community nurses' awareness, knowledge and understanding of chronic oedema management **\[R5\]**. The sustainability of the training programme and the safety and quality of care for lymphoedema patients were key outcomes that were identified in the focus groups **\[R5\]**. 

 Humphreys also worked with Thomas et al to provide the first in\-depth examination of the potential economic benefits of OGEP lymphoedema education in residential and nursing home settings. The economic burden of lymphoedema care was estimated to be GBP198,660 over a period of 6 months \(January – June 2019\). The potential costs saved due to the avoidance of GP home visits was estimated to be GBP29,213 over the same period **\[R6\]**. 

 In addition to conducting the abovementioned research, Humphreys also evaluated data collected by LNW on lympho\-venous anastomosis \(LVA\) \(2015–2019\) **\[R7\]**. This analysis showed interesting changes in resource use, costs and patient health outcomes between baseline \(pre\-treatment\) and 3\-,12\- and 24\-month follow\-ups \(post\-LVA treatment\). The analysis showed that over time, these changes result in significant long\-term cost savings for the NHS and affect HRQoL for this cohort of patients. It showed statistically significant differences in important and meaningful cost drivers in the management of chronic oedema, such as reductions in episodes of cellulitis and hospital stays due to cellulitis **\[R7\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Contributing to evidence\-based policy change** 

 The LNW has been developing innovative methods to support the management of chronic oedema within the community setting. 

 Our research showing the economic benefits of the OGEP and the WLP across the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board \(CVUHB\) **\[R4\]** underpinned a significant policy and economic decision by the WG. Based on the economic analysis outlined in **\[R3\]** and **\[R4\]**, Humphreys was able to confirm for the LNW that the OGEP and WLP reduced health care resource use and costs and that HRQoL scores increased among the patients with whom the OGEP was trialled. The LNW employed the evidence from the research to successfully lobby the Welsh Health and Social Care department to fund the rollout of the WLP throughout Wales **\[C1, C2\]**. As a result, GBP1,4,000.00 has been permanently ring\-fenced by the WG for rollout the OGEP programme across all seven HBs for the benefit of all community nurses and DNs. **\[C5, C6, C7\]** The ‘Wet Leg’ pathway is now taught as an Agored Cymru accredited unit to Health Care Support Worker \(HCSW\) and Qualified Nurses and allied health care professionals and have been taught to approximately 283 people from all over the UK. To date 21 healthcare professionals \(ranging from allied healthcare professionals to national lymphoedema specialists\) have been employed to teach and manage the OGEP pathway throughout Wales. Furthermore, as a direct result of working with Swansea University’s researcher Ioan Humphreys on the economic evaluations of the OGEP, the LNW moved part of their headquarters to the Health and Wellbeing Academy at Swansea University **\[C1\]**. This move has already increased the visibility of LNW’s research and has led to further collaboration between Humphreys and researchers within the Medical School.  This pooling of resources now includes access to the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage \(SAIL\) databank. 

 **Improving the management of chronic lymphoedema for patients and practitioners** 

 Again, based on the economic analysis outlined in **\[R3\]** and **\[R4\]**, it was evidenced that OGEP and WLP reduced health care resource use and costs and that HRQoL scores increased among the patients with whom the OGEP was trialled. The OGEP promotes the use of ‘wet leg’ treatment that is more clinically effective than previous treatments among DNs. The education on the WLP includes training on the appropriate use of compression bandaging, etc., and the resulting changes in practices have led to a significant reduction in the number of required DN visits **\[R4\] \[C4\]**. Chronic oedema can have a profound and long\-term impact on patients and impact a range of health metrics, including HRQoL. A survey \(currently being analysed and prepared for publication\) of lymphoedema practitioners was conducted between January and March 2020 on the use of the WLP. 

 Below are two example quotes from participants in the survey: 

 *“\[The WLP\]* *hugely reduced the need for dressings and Multi\-Layer Lymphoedema Bandaging \(MLLB\), more normal body image, patients able to socialise without stigma, reduction in washing and care needs for carers*” \(clinical nurse specialist, Wales\). 

 “*\[The WLP\] reduces wet legs, improves healing, patients can return to work earlier, wounds heal quicker, improves mobility*” \(lymphoedema clinical lead, Wales\). 

 The analysis and report produced by Humphreys on OGEP was also endorsed and supported by the Chief Nursing Officer of Wales \(CNO\). She noted, “ *The report makes sobering reading on the debilitating and distressing effects of this condition and I believe it is therefore essential that community nurses take a leading role in delivering effective person\-centred care \(OGEP\), which minimises the complications of the condition and eliminates hospital admissions as far as possible*” **\[C3, C4\]**. In addition, the OGEP was supported by all Directors of Nurses in Wales, as the programme is being rolled out nationally across all seven WHBs **\[C5, C6, C7\]**. Our work was cited as the only economic analysis source in the updated clinical guidelines for the WLP created by the LNW **\[C3, C4\]**. 

 **Increasing the economic impact of improved clinical care** 

 Our review of the direct costs associated with the OGEP showed that the largest differences between the outcomes at the baseline and the three\-month follow\-up review were in reduced frequency of DN home visits \(53%\). Furthermore, there was a large difference in dressings costs, with baseline of GBP52,419 being reduced to GBP9,667 \(63%\) once the OGEP was utilised **\[R4\]**. This evidence was then used by the Chief Nursing Officer to establish a discussion and funding relationship between LNW and NHS Wales **\[C4\]**. Based on the potential cost savings seen in the CVUHB alone, the total costs saved over all the WHBs implementing the WLP/OGEP are estimated to be approximately GBP24,460,000 \(an avg. GBP1,223 per patient savings\) **\[R4\]**. A DN at Hywel Dda University Health Board \(HDUHB\) noted the effectiveness and cost\-efficiency of the WLP in a comment on Twitter \(24/01/2019\) replying to a LNW staff member\): *“Introducing the ‘Wet Leg’ Pathway was one of the most clinically effective, cost\-saving and labour\-saving innovations I have ever seen in District Nursing\!\!” 

 The LNW recently secured more annual rolling funding of approximately GBP120,000 to deliver their LVA treatment for the management of lymphoedema in the Swansea Bay University Health Board. \[ **C8\] The** LNW secured this funding by citing the results of the report delivered by Humphreys **\[R7\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Teacher Education programmes \(PGDE in Primary and Secondary Education for those seeking a teaching qualification, MEd Critical Enquiry for those already qualified seeking to enhance their practice\) at UHI have been designed to meet a national need for teachers in rural areas of Scotland. This case study outlines how research undertaken by staff members on these programmes has informed the programmes’ development in order to: 

-  Encourage dialogue between students as a means of developing understanding and professional identity 

-  Harness the value of the relationship between student teacher and placement mentor 

-  Ensure student teachers embed the skills of reflection and enquiry within their professional practice and identity 

 This has had subsequent impact on: 

-  Recruitment and retention of teachers in rural areas 

-  Preparedness of programme graduates for teaching practice within a rural setting 

-  Digital preparedness of rural teachers with an increased likelihood that teachers will access professional learning opportunities online to enhance their practice 

-  Creating a strong sense of professional identity and agency within rural teachers 

-  Creating an active community of practice with dialogue and collaboration between teachers post qualification 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Teacher Education programmes at UHI are delivered using online and distance learning \(ODL\) with the teaching designed to be place\-based, to support students who currently reside in rural areas to become or remain teachers within their existing community \(Redford, 2020; **3.1**\).  Research into the experience of students on these programmes \(Coker 2015 and 2017: **3.2** and **3.3** below\), and into the experiences of rural teachers \(Coker, 2019: **3.4** below\) has yielded insights into which methods of teaching and delivery are likely to have a positive impact on the development of teacher agency \(construed as active participation in own learning\) and professional identity, including entry to, and membership of a professional community. 

 Coker \(2015\) **\(3.2\)** outlined an ethnographic study in which student teacher’s participation in the virtual learning environment \(VLE\) was observed by examining data concerning the number and nature of individual student’s interactions with this online space. There were two key findings from this study: 

-  A correlation between time spent within the VLE \(particularly repeated and prolonged use of discussion boards, and a high ratio between access to course content and access to discussion boards\) and student achievement in assessment, independent of students’ prior qualifications 

-  The level of engagement with discussion board tasks was influenced by the way that task was described and presented to students: Tasks that explicitly valued dialogue and collaboration were most engaged with whereas tasks that did not value interaction or dialogue had a lower number of postings. 

 Conclusions from this study were that successful students accessed the knowledge of their peers more effectively as well as deepening their own understanding by both authoring discussion board posts and reflecting on what they, and others had written \(metacognition\). This social aspect of learning is particularly relevant within teacher education where student teachers are developing their identity \( *becoming* teachers in addition to learning how and what to teach\) gaining entry to a professional community of practice which will influence what kinds of teachers they become. 

 Coker \(2017\) **\(3.3\)** uses qualitative data from 53 students to examine the notion of ‘agency’ \(active participation in their own learning\) of student teachers. Key findings from these studies were that: 

-  Mentors and peers are considered most influential in supporting teacher development. 

-  Student teachers had not embedded key aspects of teacher identity that were integral to the learning outcomes of the programme, namely reflection and enquiry 

 Conclusions were that agency within student teachers is tied to the notion of becoming a teacher \(as explored in **3.2\)** and that validation from a mentor, someone who is already a member of the professional community of practice, is of particular importance. Secondly, that student teachers have a short\-term focus on entry to the professional community rather than aspiring to distinct roles within the community. Finally, that agency involves actively aligning one's previous experiences with the professional values and beliefs of the professional community. 

 Coker \(2019\) **\(3.4\)** examined how rural teachers experience professional learning. Acknowledging that rurality is likely to be a barrier to participation in face\-to\-face events, the role of technology\-mediated professional learning was explored via interviews with 18 rural teachers. It was found that technology can assist rural teachers in accessing professional learning, but that opportunities for professional dialogue with peers are limited due to the small numbers of teaching staff at rural schools. Technology can also enable access to professional networks but requires teachers to be have the requisite skills and be confident in their use of technology \(including social media\) in order to reap the benefits of these dispersed networks.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **4.1 Pathway to impact: Changes to the design and delivery of the Teacher Education programmes** 

 The research outlined in section 3 has directly impacted the design and delivery of the Teacher Education programmes, with the following specific changes: 

  

-  Addition of online seminar sessions within the VLE and discussion board tasks with explicit reference to collaboration, discussion and dialogue\- activities the research showed to be beneficial for student attainment. 

-  Reconfiguration of the online environment into one single space \(formerly divided into modules\) with content organised thematically using the General Teaching Council of Scotland \(GTCS\) Standards for Preliminary Registration \(SPR\) and addition of reflective tasks\- to encourage engagement with aspects of teacher identity and professional development beyond initial qualification that were shown to be absent by the research 

-  Building in structured reflective activities into the programmes, and connecting these with students’ previous experiences in order to develop agency\- shown to be absent by the research 

  

 **4.2 Recruitment and retention of teachers in rural areas** 

 Student numbers on the PGDE programmes are controlled and allocated by the General Teaching Council of Scotland \(GTC Scotland\). Success of the PGDE Primary programme has led from an initial allocation of 20 places on the programme in 2013/14 to an allocation of 90 places in 2019/20 and 85 places in 2020/21. The suite of programmes has seen a total of 487 graduates since 2013/14 \(329 for PGDE Primary, 92 for PGDE Secondary, 66 for MEd Critical Enquiry\). Whilst they were engaged in their studies, the graduates were residents within the University Local Authority partnership \(Argyll and Bute, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, Highland, Moray, Orkney, and Shetland\). Although the University and GTC Scotland do not record teachers’ location post\-qualification, a recent survey **\(5.1\)** revealed that 85% of graduates remained within the University Local Authority partnership area after qualification and induction. This evidences a very high and healthy retention of newly qualified teachers in the Highlands and Islands region, allowing us to meet the overall objective of providing more teachers in our rural and geographically dispersed communities. 

  

 GTC Scotland recognise how the research outlined within this case study informed the development of the PGDE programmes as these were referenced heavily during the programmes’ revalidation in 2019\-20. They acknowledge the impact of the programmes on the recruitment and retention of rural teachers, and how the sound evidence base provided by this research has contributed to preparing teachers for digital practice within a rural context \( **5.2**\). These sentiments are echoed by the local Authorities that the programmes serve, with testimonials from Argyll and Bute Council \( **5.3**\) and Highland Council \( **5.4, p.1**\) acknowledging the impact of the suite of programmes on the recruitment of teachers from the local area, subsequently providing teachers for the local area. 

  

 **4.3 Preparedness of programme graduates for teaching practice** 

 Underpinned by the body of research that informed the design and delivery of the programmes, the newly qualified teachers that are now in place are well\-positioned to teach in pedagogically effective ways that align with the delivery of digitally enabled school education in rural contexts. 

  

 A recent survey of the graduates \( **5.1**\) is evidence of the programmes’ positive impact on graduates’ attitudes to and engagement with professional learning and enquiry; key to sustaining an upskilled workforce which has a positive impact on student learning. Over 80% of respondents agreed that the programme had given them to skills to engage in professional enquiry and encouraged them to undertake professional learning. The majority of respondents reported undertaking professional learning on a monthly basis. As the ability to attend face to face events is much reduced for rural teachers, it is vital that they have the skills to engage in virtual networks and collaborating online within the PGDE programmes prepare graduates for this kind of engagement when they move into professional teaching, as highlighted by one survey respondent: “\(Studying the PGDE\) definitely enhanced the skills I had in working within a professional network due to the nature of the VC/collaboration elements” **\(5.1, p.6\)**. The testimonial from Highland Council \(5.4\) provides further evidence of how this has been deeply embedded with teachers’ professional practices with their own survey data evidencing widespread commitment to professional learning and enquiry \( **5.4**, p.2, line 9\). 

  

 The programmes have also effectively fostered reflection as a skill within graduates \(identified as key to teacher agency within the research \( **3.3**\)\). The survey of graduates showed that 88% agreed that studying on the programmes had given them the skills to reflect on and improve their teaching practice **\(5.1, p.5\).** Redford and Nicol **\(forthcoming, 5.5\)** detail through activity systems analysis how the programme content and structure develops teacher agency including a commitment to professional enquiry, teacher identity within a rural setting, and a community of practice through collaborative activities. 

 The testimonial from Highland Council \(5.4\) provides some specific examples of the impact of this practice: a graduate from the secondary programme was selected as Highlands Probationer of the Year based on their embedding practical enquiry during their very first year of teaching \( **5.4**, p.2, line 15. NQT = Newly Qualified Teacher\) and a Leadership and Empowerment workstream being established within the Highland Council to continue the “expectation of teacher agency and empowerment” \( **5.4**, p.2, line 24\) that has been established and embedded by the programmes at UHI.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Following the financial crisis, the Bank of England \(BoE\) adopted ‘non\-standard’ monetary policies to stabilise the macroeconomy. Research at the University of Bath, led by Professor Tonks, demonstrated how institutional investors changed their asset allocation in response to quantitative easing \(QE\). This evidence on the effectiveness of the ‘portfolio balance channel’ gave confidence to the BoE to further extend QE. It also encouraged the European Central Bank \(ECB\) to adopt its own asset purchase programme initially worth EUR1,100 billion \(but accumulated to EUR2,600 billion by end\-2018\), confident that there was a mechanism through which QE operated. This policy helped to shield the Euro\-area from subsequent contagion effects of the European sovereign debt crises, and allowed the ECB to achieve its monetary goals, promoting growth and reducing unemployment. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **Context** 

 Following the global financial crisis of 2008, central banks and financial market regulators have been focused on the significance of financial institutions, such as banks and institutional investors, for ensuring the stability of the financial system. They have sought to understand the transmission mechanisms through which monetary policy influences the real economy, particularly in post\-crisis circumstances when there is a need to implement ‘non\-standard’ measures, such as quantitative easing \(QE\). The European Central Bank \(ECB\) started its QE asset purchase programme in 2015 and continued purchasing sovereign and corporate bonds for the next four years. By December 2018, its balance sheet had increased by EUR2,600 billion \(December 2018\). In March 2020, the ECB announced a further emergency QE programme of EUR750 billion \(March 2020\) up to the end of 2020 to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. Professor Tonks, who worked at the University of Bath between 2010 and 2018, was seconded to work at the BoE in 2012–2013 on a project to assess the behaviour of institutional investors in response to the Bank’s QE policies. 

 **The portfolio balance channel** 

 The operation of the 'portfolio balance channel' by institutional investors has been emphasised by monetary policymakers as a key channel through which QE policies work. Research by Professor Tonks and colleagues \(Joyce and Liu\) from the Bank of England \(BoE\) describes how the portfolio balance channel provides a means for central bank asset purchases to affect the real economy \(R1, R2\). By purchasing assets from the non\-bank private sector, including institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies, in return for central bank reserves, QE increases institutional investors’ broad money holdings. If money is seen as an imperfect substitute for the assets being purchased, these investors then seek to rebalance their portfolios by buying other, riskier assets, such as corporate bonds. After selling these assets, institutional investors want to rebalance their portfolios. During this rebalancing process, asset prices will rise until investors are indifferent to the overall supplies of money and financial assets. Higher asset prices, or equivalently lower yields, may in turn be passed on in lower borrowing costs for households and firms, and may also increase the net wealth of asset holders, both of which should stimulate real activity and inflation. 

 **Evidence from counterfactual exercises** 

 Tonks and his co\-authors assessed whether the investment behaviour of insurance companies and pension funds in the UK during the global financial crisis was consistent with the operation of the portfolio balance channel, by conducting a number of counterfactual exercises using both macro and micro data on the changes in asset allocations of pension funds and life insurance companies \(R1, R2\). The results suggest that QE led institutional investors to shift their portfolios away from government bonds and towards corporate bonds, demonstrating the existence of the channel. But portfolio rebalancing seems to have been limited to corporate bonds and did not extend to equities. This research is significant because it identifies the channel through which non\-standard monetary policy operates and enables policymakers to adopt channel\-related measures with the confidence that they work. The final version of the working paper \(R1\) was published in 2014, but earlier versions of this research and presentations of the results were shared internally within the Bank of England and at workshops with other central banks.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **The Bank of England** 

 The research had a critical impact on the Bank of England’s policy of quantitative easing \(QE\) because it demonstrated that the most powerful effect was on corporate bonds. Results from the research were circulated through conference presentations and internal seminars at the BoE, and then published in 2014. Evidence for the reach and significance of the research is corroborated in letters from the Deputy Governor, BoE between 2008 and 2014 and member of the Monetary Policy Committee \(MPC\), and a senior member of the BoE who was also a member of the MPC from 2009 to 2014. The Deputy Governor states that in the early days of QE, the understanding of the possible transmission channels was “ *very much guesswork*”. However: 

 “*As more evidence became available, both in the UK and the US, we were able to understand better the precise mechanisms at work. Ian Tonks’ research ... represented an important step in this process, as it demonstrated that the most powerful effect was onto corporate bonds \(a relatively close substitute for gilts\), with a much more muted impact on the prices of other assets, such as equities*” \(S1\). 

 The MPC member identified the Bath research as being particularly important for the BoE, stating that: 

 “*In the Bank of England, a range of channels were identified for the possible impact \[of QE\]... but in the main House View, the portfolio balance effects was thought particularly important. The idea was that those institutions who would have held gilts, instead get incentivised to hold riskier assets such as corporate bonds, this channelling more lending into the economy... \[the researchers\] are typically thorough in the methods and analysis, using a variety of methods to estimate the portfolio balance impact of QE*” \(S2\). 

 They further explained that the research helped “ *to set the policy agenda for the future, and \[that\] the \[BoE’s\] monetary toolkit became richer as a result*”, stating that it “i *nfluenced subsequent decision makers in other countries who continued to engage in QE after the BoE had stopped purchasing*” \(S2\). 

 **The European Central Bank** 

 The President of the European Central Bank \(ECB\), Mario Draghi, cited the research in justifying the ECB’s expanded asset purchase programme worth EUR1,100 billion, in a major policy speech in March 2015 \(S3\). The President explained that the work of Professor Tonks and colleagues demonstrated how the portfolio balance channel works for large\-scale asset purchase programmes and meant that the ECB could proceed with its own asset repurchase programme with the confidence that there was evidence that such schemes have positive macroeconomic effects. He stated: 

 “*Experience with large\-scale asset purchase programmes in other jurisdictions shows that the portfolio balance channel works. For instance, model\-based estimates show that as a consequence of the Bank of England’s quantitative easing programme, insurance companies and pension funds invested less in gilts and more in corporate bonds \[citing R1\] leading to price increases of both investment grade and non\-investment grade corporate bonds*” \(S3\). 

 The reference to R1 was the only cited piece of research in the President’s speech, attesting its salience in the decision\-making process. 

 **Impact of large\-scale asset purchases** 

 The knowledge that the research had identified the monetary transmission channel through which government asset purchase programmes work allowed the ECB to proceed with its own major asset repurchase programme in January 2015. The President of the ECB explained that: 

 “*The impact of the \[asset purchase\] programme \[in January 2015\] and the ECB’s previous monetary policy measures is visible. Bank lending rates to companies started to decline in the third quarter of last year \[2014\], market\-based measures of inflation expectations have reacted positively to the ECB’s balance sheet expansion over recent months, and Euro\-area long\-term sovereign yields have fallen – in spite of the renewed crisis in Greece. This suggests that the asset purchase programme may be shielding other euro area countries from contagion, which also helps the ECB achieve its monetary policy goals across the Euro area. The Euro\-area economy grew more than expected in the fourth quarter and unemployment fell to its lowest level since August 2012 in January. While this cannot exclusively be attributed to the ECB’s monetary policy, it certainly supports the recovery*” \(S3\). 

 **Further impact on the economy and population of the Euro area** 

 The President of the ECB stated that: “ *The beneficial impact of the ECB’s asset purchases on financing conditions will increase the benefits of governments’ structural reforms, rather than reducing incentives for reforms. Firms will be encouraged to increase investment, bringing forward the economic recovery*” \(S3\). The President of the ECB’s speech provides evidence that the ECB was able to proceed with its versions of QE in the knowledge that the Bath research had identified a channel through which QE operated. The operation of QE policies then had the anticipated benefits on the Euro\-area economies. In addition, as a senior economist at the ECB states, as a result of this research and related studies, the ECB now regularly reports on the transmission of QE through the financial system \(S4a, S4b\). 

 **Non\-standard monetary policy at other central banks and in response to COVID\-19** 

 The research has also been cited in other central bank publications, as central banks around the world have attempted to understand and implement QE policies \(S5, S6, S7\). For example, in a speech at Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium on 27/28 August 2020 \(S8\), the Governor of the BoE, explained how QE had been used by many central banks to stabilise markets in response to COVID\-19, and again cited the work of Tonks and others as evidence “ *that QE works in practice – is now supported by a rich body of empirical work, which has grown rapidly over the past decade*” \(S8, p. 9\). Bailey notes that “ *Over the past decade, QE has been widely used internationally, … \[and\] has therefore become the primary tool with which many central banks around the world have sought to affect monetary conditions*” \(S8, p. 5\).

 **1.Summary of the impact** 

 Research generating and evaluating exemplars of best practice in town centre regeneration undertaken by Professor Cassidy at Edge Hill University has had a significant impact on national policy and strategy alongside local town centre planning and practice. First, the research has had a *policy impact*, forming a major part of **The Grimsey Review 2 \(GR2\)** and subsequent **Covid supplement.** These two independent reports, which identify barriers to and recommendations for change in town centre Policy, have shaped the nature and focus of two substantial government\-funding allocations designed to re\-energise town centres and local economies: the GBP1,000,000,000 Future High Streets Fund and GBP3,600,000,000 Towns Fund. Second, the research has *influenced practice* by informing the decision making of town leaders and retail executives charged with shaping local, national and international regeneration strategy. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The impacts are underpinned by research undertaken by Professor Cassidy in the Business School at Edge Hill University between 2018 and 2020. 

 First, an evaluation of retail best practice in town centre regeneration based on data collected between January and July 2018 and March and June 2020. A case methodology, identifying and evaluating exemplars of best practice through the evolving Service\-Dominant Logic \(S\-DL\) and its service ecosystems perspective, revealed insights about successful value co\-creation practice. Key findings highlighted a\). Benefits for retailers of close collaboration with other sectors and businesses, \(most notably tourism, leisure and health\) in developing a community ‘hub’ solution b\). The importance of aligning the retail mission with the holistic ‘place’ plan and c\). The importance of engaging members of the community in developing innovative retail/service solutions. **\(Ref 1\)** 

 Second, close scrutiny of activities within one particular town centre service ecosystem, also drawing on case methodology, S\-DL and institutional theory. The analysis identified seven ‘norms’ shared by actors within the eco\-system, which served to maintain and support successful regeneration activity. **\(Ref 2\)** Most critically, the normative analysis reinforced the importance of drawing collaboratively on operant resources amongst local actors within the community to shape successful strategy implementation. The data collection for this research took place between July 2016 and October 2017, with data analysis and theoretical framing continuing at Edge Hill and ultimately informing the case set featured in GR2 **\(Ref 3\)**. The findings and case studies from the research featured in chapters written by Cassidy in GR2, **\(Ref 3 pp. 42\-55\)** and the Covid supplement **\(Ref 4 pp. 33\-64**\). As the sole academic author, Professor Cassidy’s research directly informed recommendations included in GR2 and its Covid supplement in three key areas: 

 1. Highlighted the importance of mobilising *community engagement and collaboration for effective regeneration.* This emphasis on localism and community empowerment represents a significant challenge to existing policy with place making and community building ‘having become an anathema to those in central and local governments who have a stranglehold over our high street’ **\(Ref 3 p.10\)**. The Covid supplement also called for ‘a massive shift in power away from central government to local communities’ with local people being empowered to ‘redesign their own high streets and have a say on the businesses, services and amenities that occupy it’ **\(Ref 4 p.3\)**. To operationalise community engagement, **recommendation 1 in GR2,** called for the establishment of a Town Centre Commission with a defined remit to build a 20\-year vision or strategy for each unique place **\(Ref 3 p.1\)**. 

 2. Identified successful retailers, who had *repositioned themselves within a new community ‘hub’ high street solution*, replacing mass consumerism with a focus that values the environment and fosters a new sense of community. For many, survival involved establishing closer relationships with health and leisure providers and stronger links with heritage and community assets. Planning use legislation was cited as a barrier to further collaboration and innovation between retailers and other types of business, generating **recommendation 18 in GR2**, a call to ‘review and amend the planning use class system legislation to enable greater flexibility of building use’ **\(Ref 3 p.9\)**. The point was emphasised again in the Covid supplement, with **recommendation 21**, Planning and Use Classes, calling for Government to ‘deregulate the use class system and give Local Authorities the opportunity to develop an appropriate proposition to attract people to live, work, play and visit a unique town’ **\(Ref 4 p.8\)** 

 3. Generated *exemplars of best practice in town centre regeneration* and *two significant Case Studies*: Roeselare in Flanders and Stockton\-on\-Tees in the North East of the UK. These exemplars and case studies highlighted the importance of continuing to capture and evaluate best practice and generated **recommendation 2 in GR2,** a call for the establishment of a National Independent organisation to ‘capture and share best practice’. This would be available for towns to access and would include academic research, investment models and case studies, as well as information and advice on how to build an evidence base and how to write a town plan supported by a network of experts **\(Ref 3 p.8\)**.

 **4. Details of the Impact** 

 **Context**: The decline of UK high streets is arguably not a new problem. Over the past decade, an increase in online shopping, competition from out\-of\-town retail parks and the rise of a convenience culture has forced many retailers to close tens of thousands of stores in centres across the world. Many see this decline in physical stores as an inevitable consequence of retailers’ inability to develop an effective and efficient omni\-channel offer, which meets the needs of an increasingly ‘digitally obsessed consumer’. Others attribute the decline more to failure in central government policy, failures to address overly bureaucratic local leadership practices, outdated planning and building regulations and an ineffective business rate scheme. Arresting this decline represents a significant challenge to Government with town centres seen to represent ‘a crucial part of our communities and local economies, creating jobs, nurturing small businesses and injecting billions of pounds into our economy’. In the UK, retailers contribute to a high street that comprises some 95,000 companies with a total net worth of GBP135,000,000,000, significantly more than the education budget of GBP53,000,000,000, the defence budget of GBP24,000,000,000 and health at GBP110,000,000,000. 

 **Pathways to Impact**: The first Grimsey Review of the High Street, published as a rejoinder to the Portas Review in 2013, received extensive media and government attention. Many considered it a milestone in the journey towards policy change. In 2018, however, frustrated by the lack of progress, Bill Grimsey invited Cassidy to contribute to a second review **\(GR2\)** which resurfaced the problems facing town centres and stimulated an immediate policy response. The success of GR2 led to a call for the same team to examine the potential pandemic related consequences for town centres and high streets and resulted in the publication of the Grimsey **COVID Supplement** in June 2020. Cassidy was the sole academic contributor to both reports responsible for strengthening the evidence base with robust research. Her input was ‘invaluable, collating and evaluating evidence of best practice from towns around the UK and Europe, which were used to frame the recommendations’ **\(source 1\).** Both reports have had a demonstrable impact on national policy and direction and local planning and action as outlined below. 

 **Impact on town centre regeneration policy** 

 GR2 was published in July 2018. In October 2018, the Government launched the **Future High Street Fund \(FHSF\)**, a GBP675,000,000 allocation to help local areas make their high streets and town centres fit for the future. This included funds to establish a **High Streets Task Force \(HSTF\)** to provide hands\-on support to local areas to develop innovative strategies to help high streets evolve, connect local areas to relevant experts and share best practice. GBP55,000,000 of that fund was set aside to support the regeneration of heritage high streets, with Historic England receiving GBP40,000,000 for its High Streets Heritage Action Zones programme. The FHSF and the HSTF were formally established in response to recommendations made by the High Streets Expert panel chaired by Sir John Timpson. The High Streets Minister commissioned this panel in July 2018, immediately following the publication of GR2, to diagnose the issues facing high streets and town centres and advise on practical actions for central government. The findings and recommendations were published in the High Street Report **\(source 2\)** with interim findings actioned in the Autumn budget. Many of these findings and recommendations mirror those presented in GR2, linked to Cassidy’s research **\(Ref 1 and 2\)**. The FHSF is viewed as a major milestone and the start of serious and sustained Government investment in town centre regeneration. In July 2019, the Prime Minister announced a further GBP3,600,000,000 **Towns Fund \(TF\)** to re\-energise local economies. This included an additional GBP325,000,000 for the Future High Streets Fund, bringing the total to GBP1,000,000,000. 

 As well as highlighting the urgent need for investment, the evidence shows that GR2 and the COVID supplement have been instrumental in shaping both the *remit and structure of the HSTF* and *the nature of the funding criteria* for both the FHSF and the TF. The executive summary in the High Street Report explicitly acknowledges the contribution of the evidence in ‘Bill Grimsey’s reviews of high streets and town centres’ **\(source 2 p.7\)** and specific recommendations in GR2 can be linked directly to the panel’s recommendations. 

 The *remit* outlined for HSTF mirrors **recommendation 2 in GR2,** calling for the establishment of a National Independent organisation to ‘capture and share best practice’, which should be available for towns to access. The High Street report cites ‘GR2’ ‘as an example that the Department \(HCLG\) should examine before setting up the Task Force’ **\(source 2 p.9\).** The HCLG select committee report on High streets and town centres in 2030, which also informed the High Street report recommendations, reinforces the direct link between recommendation 2 in GR2 and the HSTF. The report acknowledges the recommendation from GR2 for ‘a central data hub that we can populate with statistics and best practice for people to access’ and acknowledges a direct link to the creation of the HSTF as part of the FHSF **\(source 3 p.58\).** It is clear that the research continues to influence the work of the HSTF. In May 2020, Cassidy was invited to join the Professional, Research and Data Group \(PRDG\), a subgroup of the Task Force, to work to understand the evidence base for high streets and their transformation, helping to inform action and policy. The Chair of the HSTF also recently described the COVID supplement as ‘insightful and inspiring’ and ‘not a surprise given the quality of the team behind it’. GR2 and the COVID supplement are both cited as key resources on the HSTF website. In a personal response to the COVID supplement sent to Bill Grimsey in August 2020, the Minister of State for Regional Growth and Local Government concludes with personal thanks for ‘offering insights shared as the High Streets Task Force has developed since Budget 2018’ **\(source 4\)**. 

 As well as pointing to the need for a Task Force, the recommendations in GR2 also shaped the nature of the *funding criteria* for both the FHSF and the TF. A key finding from GR2 was that successful regeneration would depend on strong local leadership, which could ‘bring together all stakeholders, including the community, to develop and implement a plan for location’ **\(Ref 3 p.6\)**. To operationalise community engagement, **recommendation 1 in GR2** called for the establishment of a Town Centre Commission with a defined remit to build a 20\-year vision or strategy for each unique place. The High Street Report picked up on the need for funding applications to give greater powers to council leaders and to communities. ‘Bids should demonstrate the involvement of the wider community in articulating a shared vision… empowering local people, organisations, businesses, and institutions to be active contributors and partners’ **\(source 2 p.12\).** The criteria for applications for funding for the TF made this even more explicit, with the requirement for Councils to establish Town Deals Boards to develop and drive investment plans. The board should reflect the diversity of the town and surrounding area and include members of all tiers of local government for the geography of the town, the MP\(s\) representing the town, the Local Enterprise Partnership, local businesses and investors and community/local voluntary community sector representatives. 

 Recommendations from GR2 have also stimulated legislative change. To enable innovation and greater collaboration between different types of business, the best practice exemplars highlighted the need for urgent changes to the archaic class use system. **Recommendation 18 in GR2**, called for a review and amendment of ‘the planning use class system legislation to enable greater flexibility of building use’. **Recommendation 21 in the COVID supplement** reemphasised this, calling for Government to ‘deregulate the use class system and give Local Authorities the opportunity to develop an appropriate proposition to attract people to live, work, play and visit a unique town’. In his response to the COVID supplement, **\(source 4\)** the Minister of State for Regional Growth and Local Government explicitly acknowledged the Government response to this with reference to new regulations, which came into force on September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020. He explained that ‘the Government has introduced regulations to reform and simplify the Use Classes Order to make it easier for high street users to change use without the need for a planning application. This will create a new broad category of ‘commercial, business and service’ uses, which will allow commercial, retail and leisure uses greater freedom to adapt to changing circumstances and respond to the needs of their local communities’ **\(source 4\)**. 

 It is clear that research from GR2 and the COVID supplement continues to shape policy. The COVID supplement, for example, has formed the basis for oral evidence given by Grimsey to the HCLG select committee hearing ‘Supporting our high streets after Covid\-19, HC 624002112020. 

 **Informing town centre regeneration strategies** 

 All 343 Councils in the UK are eligible to apply for the FHSF, with 300 submitting bids to date. 100 places have been targeted to submit detailed proposals for the TF. Since 2018, Cassidy has been actively sharing her research findings with council leaders submitting applications for these two income streams. Inputs based on Cassidy’s guidance have focused on the nature and significance of community participation and guidance on the potential for innovative collaborations within the community ‘hub’ solution, both key outputs from the research. These inputs have taken the form of keynote presentations \(e.g. to DCN leaders on a Local Government Authority High Street Leadership programme\), and consultations with specific councils \(including Warrington, Stockton, Coventry, Mansfield, Wolverhampton and West Lancashire\). In January 2020, Cassidy was chair, convenor and keynote speaker at a Town Deals workshop for senior executives from a selection of the 100 towns eligible for TD funds in Nottinghamshire. The aim of the workshop was to offer support for towns submitting funding applications, to work on strategic aims, consider examples of good practice and co\-operate across councils to share ideas. As of December 2020, Warrington, West Lancashire, Mansfield, Stockton, Sutton in Ashfield, Nottingham City, and Buxton have all been successful in securing funding allocations. Stockton Council received GBP16,543,812 from FHSF to support a radical transformation of Stockton\-on\-Tees town centre. This was a case developed by Cassidy, featured in GR2, involving the creation of a community ‘hub’ solution focused on leisure, events and recreation rather than retail. West Lancashire Borough Council have recently secured a substantial GBP755,000 match fund from Historic England to deliver the High Street Heritage Action Zone programme in Ormskirk. Cassidy’s research has ‘helped shape the content of funding applications by highlighting strategies to effectively engage business community stakeholders and offering insights about ways in which retailers might work with assets to develop more community focused town centres’ **\(source 5\)**. Most critically, ‘it has shaped how high streets, and the business and communities that engage with them, need to evolve and adapt to new market demand to overcome the challenges faced by our UK high streets today’ **\(source 5\)**. Cassidy has recently been working with Sefton Borough Council, offering advice on their ambitious GBP50,000,000 plan submitted to the TF to transform Southport. The plan emphasises community participation in the development of an effective place proposition and enhances the leisure and health aspects of the town, rather than focusing solely on retail. Cassidy’s research contribution, advice and insights are seen to ‘have had a positive effect on the final submission’ **\(source 6\).** There is further evidence that the research from GR2 and the COVID supplement is impacting Council decision making. Oxfordshire County Council, for example, have included a recommendation for Grimsey style Town Commissions in their post\-Covid Economic Recovery Plan. Others are actively promoting the Grimsey reviews in the place making toolkits that provide for Districts. \( **source 7 p.7**\) 

-  *Influencing town centre strategy beyond the UK* 

 A further key output from Cassidy’s research has been the development of a major case study of best practice in collaboration with the Head of Economic Development from the town of Roeselare in Flanders. The case featured in both GR2 and the COVID supplement. Recommendations from Cassidy’s work have also fed into the town of Roeselare city centre plan, emphasising collaboration between retailers and existing leisure and heritage services in a community hub solution. As the Head of Economic Development states, ‘the evaluation and feedback we got was crucial in the development of the second city centre plan. Aside from the plan, Cassidy also helped local retailers think about their businesses and how to work more closely with other sectors e.g. Horeca. So our cooperation not only had a theoretical outcome but was also very practical for several local businesses and retailers’ **\(source 8\)**. Cassidy was also involved in facilitating a study tour of Roeselare \(June 28<sup>th</sup> – 29<sup>th</sup> 2019\) for members of the District Council Network. All 30 members attending the tour were in the process of submitting a bid for the FHSF, which required them to submit an outline vision for one of their local high streets. 

-  *Connecting retail and heritage assets* 

 A key strand of Cassidy’s research highlighted ways in which traditional retailers might collaborate with heritage assets to reinforce a distinctive place proposition. These insights have had an impact on retailers and strategy makers in the town of Southwell in Nottinghamshire. Following a scoping visit in 2019, Cassidy facilitated a workshop for 40 local retail businesses operating in Southwell, \(members of the Shop Southwell Independent traders association\) and representatives of Southwell Minster \(February 2020\). The workshop featured the exemplars of retail best practice from the research in an effort to revitalise the businesses in Southwell high street and enable them to make a stronger connection between the town and the minster, a key heritage asset. Since February 2020, ‘thanks to Professor Cassidy, many of her recommendations are ones I have been able to adapt, share with colleagues at Newark and Sherwood District Council \(NSDC\) and put into practice with the group to help them though so difficult a time’ **\(source 9\).** These include supporting retailers, via the NSDC High Street Diversification Fund, with grants towards creating or improving their transactional capability and developing a stylish and instantly recognisable ‘look’ and image for the Shop Southwell group’ **\(source 9\).** Cassidy’s recommendation has led to ‘continuing liaison with the Minster to encourage visitors to both explore our famous attraction and unique independent shops with the aim of making Southwell a true retail destination’ **\(source 9\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 JournalTOCs helps researchers to timely access ‘personalised’ new research by alerting them when new articles are published in their selected journals and, by providing them with full\-text links when the articles are Open Access \(OA\). These OA links were the result of JEMO, a technology developed by JournalTOCs in 2014 to resolve the problem of OA articles published in hybrid journals being erroneously kept behind pay\-walls. Since 2015, JEMO has been adopted by over 20,000 scholarly journals and publishing platforms including Atypon. This has led to JournalTOCs being used extensively worldwide by multiple research centres, libraries and multinationals. JournalTOCs also works with over 3,770 scholarly publishers and its effect reaches 78 licensed research centres in 19 countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 JournalTOCs is a university spin\-off from research undertaken at the ICBL \(Institute for Computer Based Learning\) of Heriot\-Watt University. JournalTOCs technology includes real\-time data\-mining software to discover latest content published in scholarly journals. The software first aggregates, normalises and enriches metadata and then makes it freely available for reuse. JournalTOCs uses JEMO to identify OA content in the metadata extracted from hybrid journals. 

 To further develop JournalTOCs JEMO was the result of a project funded by the EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account \(IAA\) \(2015\). The project had twofold objectives: 

1.  to help publishers make their journal metadata readily available for systematic identification of OA articles and, 

1.  to prevent OA articles from being labelled as non\-OA across the production, 

 discovery, and delivery chain of e\-journals. 

 The JEMO project was a partnership formed by the ICBL with five publishers \(Oxford University Press, Libertas Academica, Edinburgh University Press, IGI Global and Thieme\), INASP \(the International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications\) and a consortium of six NHS\-England hospital libraries. JEMO includes a metadata schema adapted from the Dublin Core, PRISM and Creative Commons \(CC\) metadata schemas. JEMO showed publishers how it was possible to make their OA content discoverable, using a cost\-effective and relatively technically easy process. At that time, NISO produced its own specifications \(the NISO RP\-22\-2015 recommendation\) and disseminated its usage among publishers. However, JEMO has proved to be much more effective than the NISO RP\-22\-2015 metadata specification and has been widely adopted by publishers and hosting platforms. The results produced by the JEMO project was expanded with the MOOD Knowledge Transfer Project to cover online\-first articles. 

 The application of these technologies developed by the ICBL for JournalTOCs resulted in a free service for hundreds of thousands of individual users. In addition, a Premium service, created to ensure the sustainability of the spin\-off, has been licensed to more than 70 large and small research centres and libraries worldwide at very economic licence rates. Of special relevance to Open Access, and crucial to the Plan S initiative of the European Science Foundation, is the tagging of journals in the JournalTOCs database as OA or hybrid. In 2018, JournalTOCs included more selected OA journals than other services, and was unique in having identified and included individual OA articles from more than 12,000 hybrid journals. A coherent subject indexing further enhances the value of JournalTOCs.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

  

 Licensed research centres and libraries from hospitals, universities, governmental agencies, global organisations, banks as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies use JournalTOCs. They use JournalTOCs to discover critical research results for their researchers. The usefulness of JournalTOCs was enhanced when the results of the JEMO \(2015\) and MOOD projects were integrated within JournalTOCs, enabling it to provide users with full\-text links for individual OA articles. JEMO has been adopted by over 20,000 scholarly journals and publishing platforms such as Atypon, leading to JournalTOCs now working with over 3,770 scholarly publishers and its effect reaches 78 licensed research centres in 19 countries. 

 Research\-driven biopharmaceutical companies such as NovoNordisk Pharma, Roche and Ferring Pharmaceuticals as well as hospitals from the NHS, The Australian Health Service \[5.1\] and the New Zealand Police are using JournalTOCs, thus saving considerable time and resources. The Information Resource Manager from Ferring Pharmaceuticals described how his company uses JournalTOCs, ""The service is used as a one\-stop\-shop for signing up for TOC alerts. As knowledge workers in commercial organisations \(based on R & D activities\) we are in a combined situation of being extremely dependant on having exhaustive knowledge of new developments within our research field and having very little time to identify all relevant sources of information. A service that allows you to quickly and conveniently sign up for TOCs from any journal of potential relevance is a highly valuable tool."" \(5.2\) 

 The Knowledge & Information Coordinator \(New Zealand Police Library\) confirmed that, 

 ”Having an institutional licence to JournalTOCS over the last five years……has enabled us to provide a one\-stop\-shop approach to providing table of contents alerting to all our subscribed journals. If we did not have an affordable product like JournalTOCs, it would be a logistical nightmare trying to provide a table of contents service to our customers” \[5.3\]. 

 The European University Institute, Library describing the, “unified interface and the alerts’ service”...as…”particularly valuable” \[5.4\]. 

 Over 70 companies and organisations bought licences for JournalTOCs Premium services and thousands of researchers and librarians use the free version of the technology every day. In addition, many research organisations from the UK, USA, France, Denmark, Canada, Australia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Italy, Norway, Germany, Brazil and Spain, are accessing information tagged with JEMO elements through JournalTOCs web services \(API\) to integrate new research with OA identification in their own applications. In addition, important worldwide organisations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization \(FAO\), the International Monetary Fund's \(IMF\) Library Network, the International Labour Organization \(ILO\), and the European Commission are Premium partners of JournalTOCs. 

 The largest consortium was signed with the Indian Space Research Organisation \(ISRO\) to provide premium access to new research, identified as Open Access or non\-OA regardless of their provenance. The ISRO consortium includes 17 large aerospace research centres located in different parts of India \( [https://www.isro.gov.in/about\-isro/isro\-centres](https://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro/isro-centres)\). The leading research centre of ISRO is the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre \(VSSC\). This consortium has been running since June 2017. Since the formation of the consortium JournalTOCs has been introduced to all libraries under ISRO. Currently 17 libraries are using this service and total number of users is about 8,000. In the VSSC library there are about 2,000 users and some of them following approximately 100 journals \[5.5\]. 

 In addition, JournalTOCS established a partnership with the Quality Open Access Market \(QOAM\) service. QOAM was created by the CWTS \(Centre for Science and Technology Studies\) of Leiden University from The Netherlands. QOAM is a marketplace for scientific and scholarly journals which publish articles in Open Access. JournalTOCs has become critical to QOAM operation in matching author experiences with a journal against its publishing fees \[5.6\].

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Strathclyde fluorescence lifetime research continues to contribute to growth in the commercial success of spin\-out scientific equipment manufacturer HORIBA Jobin Yvon IBH Ltd \(HORIBA\-IBH\). The company develops products exploiting the technical, operational and cost advantages of high repetition rate semiconductor light sources and photon detectors for markets spanning life sciences, healthcare, chemistry, nanotechnology, and solar energy. Recent expansion of its facilities in Glasgow has supported growth in HORIBA’s leading 16% share of the USD152,000,000 global fluorescence spectroscopy market in 2013 to 22% in 2020. Recently the company introduced rapid fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy \(FLIM\) for the study in real time of live cells and transient species which is impacting on a range of medical applications. Strathclyde and HORIBA’s collaboration was recognised through Institute of Physics Awards in 2019 and 2020.

##  2. Underpinning research 

###  Context 

 Fluorescence studies are key analytical techniques across many research and commercial applications, providing detailed information about both the emitting substance and its local environment. Beyond academic research, they are key tools in industrial biomedical research and diagnostics, the pharmaceutical industry, and in environmental monitoring. In particular, fluorescence lifetime techniques, which are independent of fluorophore concentration, photo\-bleaching, excitation intensity fluctuations, scattered light, and excitation and detection wavelengths, provide particular performance and implementation benefits compared with intensity\-based techniques, resulting in robust and easily calibrated analytical tools. An extensive body of time\-resolved fluorescence research, undertaken over the past two decades by Strathclyde’s Photophysics Group led by Prof David Birch, has spanned fundamental research studies of fluorescence mechanisms, development of novel instrumentation, and the implementation of techniques to a range of biomedical research and healthcare applications. 

###  Advances in fluorescence instrumentation 

 Research into the application of newly emerging light sources to time\-resolved spectroscopy has enabled the replacement of unstable spark flashlamps or complex and expensive mode\-locked short\-pulse laser systems with high repetition rate semiconductor light\-emitting diode \(LED\) and laser diode sources, resulting in smaller, more reliable and more cost\-effective systems. This, in turn, has extended the performance and usability of systems, thus expanding the market by opening\-up a wide range of applications to non\-specialist users. 

 One key research achievement was the development of LED sources, and associated drive electronics, operating at MHz repetition rates, representing a significant improvement on previous LEDs operating at \~10kHz. An inexpensive, miniaturized and portable blue\-green indium gallium nitride \(InGaN\) LED source and drive electronics produced \~1.9ns pulses at up to 10MHz. This LED source was shown to be ideal for faster acquisition of fluorescence decay data using time\-correlated single\-photon counting \(TCSPC\). Experiments confirmed agreement with previous results obtained with a Ti:Sapphire laser, but at around 1% of the capital and running costs \[ **R1**\]. 

 The capabilities of the LED approach were extended through collaborative research with IBH Ltd \(a spin\-out from Strathclyde co\-founded in 1977 by Prof David Birch and later incorporated into HORIBA as its TCSPC Centre of Excellence\). This led to the development of UV LED sources that enabled, for the first time, the routine and inexpensive excitation of protein intrinsic fluorescence decay using a semiconductor source, widening opportunities for solvated protein structural studies that had been unfulfilled since fluorescence was first observed from amino acids in the 1950s. The resulting paper reported excitation of the amino acid tyrosine at 280nm \[ **R2**\], and subsequent joint publications with IBH addressed the other two fluorescent amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine. 

 More recent research has focussed on fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy \(FLIM\) which uses fluorescence lifetime for contrast rather than fluorescence intensity as used in conventional microscopy. Conventional FLIM is limited by its slow rate of sequential scanning of a sample. However, recent collaboration between Strathclyde, Edinburgh University and HORIBA\-IBH on single\-photon avalanche diode \(SPAD\) timing arrays has greatly enhanced the multiplexed data acquisition rates of FLIM \[ **R3**\] and led to a new product, the FLIMera. When combined with developments in software and firmware, a 192 x 128 pixel array, implemented in 40nm complementary metal\-oxide\-semiconductor \(CMOS\) technology, with individual pixel timing, has resulted in image capture times of 15s, a 64\-fold improvement on previous commercial scanning systems. This has enabled live cell imaging at video scanning rates of 30 frames per second. 

###  Application of fluorescence instrumentation advances to healthcare 

 **Study of early stage Alzheimer’s disease:** Alzheimer’s disease is thought to be triggered by beta\-amyloid \( *A*\) aggregating to form cytotoxic oligomers in the brain. These had previously been widely studied only in the later stages of development, with the limitation that the extrinsic biochemical probes used perturb the very local structure under study. The research described in \[ **R2**\] enabled, for the first time, the critical early stages of aggregation of *A* to be studied in native form using the fluorescence of *A*’s single tyrosine. As a result, elements of the causes of Alzheimer’s and potential therapies can now be studied in vitro at a molecular level without the distortions to the local environment caused by extrinsic probes \[ **R4**\]. 

 **Developing a smart sensor for diabetes management:** A long\-term collaboration with King’s College London School of Medicine and Guys Hospital on in vivo glucose sensing for diabetes management using fluorescence lifetime sensing has led to an improved performance non\-invasive Concanavalin A\- based smart sensor for serum glucose. The sensor utilises transdermal red light excitation, which enhances signal fidelity by minimising the fluorescence of endogenous species \[ **R5**\]. This demonstrated the digital advantages of laser diode TCSPC in a non\-invasive sensor compared with analogue frequency domain lifetime measurement used previously, and encouraged diabetes researchers to consider TCSPC as a method of data acquisition. 

 **Improved FLIM for medical diagnostics and surgery:** Rapid FLIM with SPAD arrays and 100MHz pulsed laser diode sources have also been investigated for new methods of fluid biopsy for cancer screening based on the Strathclyde group’s development of a cancer biopsy using gold intracellular nanoprobes. This detects a tumour cell when a messenger RNA cancer biomarker releases a plasmonically\-quenched dye bound to a complementary single\-stranded DNA hairpin. This increases the fluorescence intensity and lifetime, thereby uniquely identifying the cancer gene of interest \[ **R6**\]. A 2020 Strathclyde\-HORIBA\-IBH joint publication in Meas. Sci. Technol. demonstrated the FLIMera’s capability for real\-time tumour margin estimation, thus bringing FLIM to fluorescence\-guided surgery.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Co\-founded by David Birch and incorporated in 1977 as a spin\-out from Strathclyde, IBH Ltd was acquired by multinational company HORIBA in 2003 to form HORIBA Jobin Yvon IBH Ltd \(HORIBA\-IBH\), bringing together IBH’s leading technology in pulsed fluorescence lifetime systems and HORIBA steady\-state fluorescence systems to produce a joint product line \[ **S1**\]. The success of the IBH acquisition helped trigger HORIBA’s 2014 acquisition of Photon Technology Inc. David Birch served as IBH Chairman from 1977 to 2003 and subsequently as HORIBA\-IBH Director of Science and Technology. Through this route, the body of research described has: 

-  Expanded the commercial success of HORIBA\-IBH, through new products, improved product performance, and wider application of fluorescence lifetime instrumentation across a number of sectors but particularly in underpinning healthcare 

-  Enabled economic growth, including contributing to HORIBA achieving and maintaining the leading position in the global fluorescence spectroscopy market 

-  Facilitated global multidisciplinary research through enhanced capabilities for users 

-  Supported fluorescence research communities globally, with international training workshops and the founding of a fluorescence journal 

###  Impact 1: New and improved products 

 Strathclyde’s research has been a major influence on HORIBA\-IBH’s product development \[ **S2**\] and has enabled the company to introduce fluorescence products, both optical source components and full systems, utilising semiconductor optical sources that combine lower cost, improved reliability, enhanced repetition rate \(up to 100MHz\) and better spectral coverage than the previously used spark discharge sources. **R1** and **R2**, which described these developments, were noted in world\-leading expert Joseph Lakowicz’s 2006 *Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy \(3<sup>rd</sup> Edition\)* as ‘perhaps the most important development for TCSPC since 2000.’ 

 The *NanoLED* range of sources, with repetition rates up to 1MHz, was introduced from 2000, with the UV version launched in 2004, followed by the *DeltaDiode* range in 2013. At launch, the *DeltaDiode’s* repetition rate of up to 100MHz, combined with pulse durations of \~100\-200ps, was the highest available in the field. Improved time resolution enables lifetimes down to 5ps to be measured with TCSPC \[ **S3**\], facilitating a better understanding of transient dynamics in solids, liquids, colloids and polymers on the nanometre scale. The reduction in timing electronics dead time to 10ns combined with the 100MHz *DeltaDiode* has enabled fluorescence decays to be measured in ms rather than seconds \[ **S3**\], opening up application in the analysis of transient samples. The main commercial and application benefits have been achieved through integration of these semiconductor sources in complete fluorescence lifetime systems such as the present range of *DeltaFlex*, *DeltaPro* and *DeltaTime* dedicated lifetime systems, introduced around 2013 and hybrid lifetime versions of the *Fluorolog* and *FluoroMax* steady\-state fluorimeters \[ **S1**\]. 

 Compared with previous technologies and systems, these products are very user friendly with largely turnkey operation, benefiting from features such as a touchscreen software interface as well as the ease of use and reliability of the semiconductor sources.  This has significantly widened market appeal by attracting non\-specialist users, with HORIBA\-IBH fluorescence products now employed across healthcare, life sciences, pharmaceutical, material sciences, nanotechnology and energy research, in both academic and commercial settings. 

 Recent product development has resulted in a fully integrated spectroscopy\-microscopy laboratory suite incorporating the single\-photon avalanche diode \(SPAD\) fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy \(FLIM\) research described in \[ **R3**\]. *FLIMera*, the HORIBA\-IBH new SPAD FLIM molecular movie camera, launched at Photonics West in February 2020, enables, for the first time, video rate live cell FLIM, benefiting applications such as cancer screening and fluorescence guided surgery. A leading expert in fluorescence from Texas Christian University \(TCU\) has described this work as ‘ground\-breaking …. this new contribution has the potential to revolutionize biomedical imaging, enabling truly live imaging of various cellular processes’ \[ **S4**\]. When awarding the FLIMera its 2019 Business Innovation Award, the Institute of Physics described it as ‘game changing technology’ \[ **S5**\]. 

###  Impact 2: Economic impact, market leading product sales 

 HORIBA\-IBH’s product innovation has led to considerable and ongoing economic success for the business.  Sales figures presented here are obtained from reputable and independent market reports from Strategic Directions International \(SDI\) \[ **S6**\], supplemented by market share information provided by the company \[ **S2**\].  From SDI data on the global fluorescence spectroscopy market \(wider than the lifetime fluorescence market\), HORIBA corporately has the largest market share, growing from 16% of USD152,000,000 i.e. USD24,300,000 \(04\-2013\) in 2013 to a projected 22% of USD186,000,000 i.e. USD40,900,000 \(04\-2020\) in 2020 \(nearest competitor at 13% market share\). Turning to the global lifetime fluorescence segment of the market, this is consistently the fastest growing segment and SDI consistently record HORIBA as the major player in the segment. \[Text removed for publication\] This growth is also evidenced by the HORIBA\-IBH’s annual reports which show net assets growing from GBP465,000 to GBP725,000 over the REF period, a growth of 56% \[ **S7**\]. 

 As a result of sales growth, HORIBA\-IBH, which undertakes all of HORIBA’s lifetime fluorescence product design, manufacturing and sales support functions in Glasgow, moved to new premises, increasing its space in 2015 from 4,800sq ft to 6,660sq ft. \[Text removed for publication\] HORIBA\-IBH is part of HORIBA Scientific which internationally expanded into new premises in New Jersey, USA, in 2018 by 90% to 132,000sq ft. 

###  Impact 3: Facilitating global multidisciplinary research and development 

 HORIBA\-IBH’s market reflects the international nature of the fluorescence spectroscopy market which is approximately evenly split across North America, Europe and Asia with China the fastest growing market \[ **S6**\]. The company has over 1000 customer sites world\-wide which span industry, government laboratories and academia \[ **S2, S4**\] reflecting the market sector breakdown across pharma/biotech \(41%\), applied \(27%\), public sector \(20%\), industrial \(12%\) sectors \[ **S6**\]. Experts in the field and users describe HORIBA\-IBH products as ‘a major leap in technology’ that provide ‘outstanding performance combined with ease of use’ and are ‘used by leading laboratories all over the world’ \[ **S4**\]. 

###  Impact 4: Supporting fluorescence research communities, industrial and academic 

 Strathclyde and HORIBA’s roles at the forefront of the sector have led to a range of activities supporting communications across academia and industry, and providing training to increase fluorescence R&D capacity internationally; these include: 

-  First launched in 2009 and sponsored by HORIBA \(enabling nominal cost or free registration\), FluoroFest is a series of international hands\-on training workshops. Five FluoroFest workshops have taken place around the world since August 2013, consistently attracting around 100 delegates from industry and academia \[ **S2, S8**\]. 

-  A Photophysics CPD course was launched at Czech Technical University, Prague, in 2013, when it ran over 6 days, and rerun in 2017 over 3 days, each with approximately 25 attendees 

-  Institute of Physics Publishing \(IOPP\), launched the journal Methods and Applications in Fluorescence \(MAF\) in 2013, with David Birch as founding co\-editor in chief, a position he still holds. IOPP’s decision to launch the journal was based in part on their strong connection to Strathclyde’s Photophysics Group through the latter’s publications in IOPP journals \[e.g. **R1**, **R2**\]. An associated MAF international conference series, launched biennially in 1989 and annually in 2019, is now the world’s largest fluorescence conference. Both the journal and conference are heavily supported by industry and HORIBA is always a major sponsor.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Collaborative research between University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Whittle Laboratory and Rolls\-Royce into gas turbine aerodynamics between 2005 and 2014 has led to a new compressor blade design that is now standard in all modern Rolls\-Royce civil aero engines. The developed elliptical leading edge blade technology has been used in almost 2500 new aero engines delivered since 2014, with a further almost 2,000 engines on order as of December 2019. As well as being part of new engine designs, four older generations of engines have been revised and retrofitted with the technology. For two engines alone, 45 airlines are operating aircraft equipped with this technology. The technology delivers fuel savings of 0.5% to 0.7%, which can be estimated to be delivering savings of USD219,000,000 per year for airlines.

### 1.  Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 There is a long\-standing collaborative research relationship between University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Whittle Laboratory and Rolls\-Royce on fundamental research in turbomachinery. The research described below formed part of the University Gas Turbine Partnership with Rolls\-Royce, which was inaugurated in 2001 and incorporates formal processes for technology and people transfer. 

 The compressor of a gas turbine is made up of many blades \(around 4,000 in large civil engines\). The air flow over each blade is highly sensitive to the geometry of the leading edge of the blade, and changes to the geometry of the leading\-edge, and can cause the flow to separate. This separation causes the flow close to the surface to transition from laminar to turbulent and results in a significant detrimental impact on engine efficiency. Small changes in the design geometry, shape perturbations due to manufacturing variability, and in\-service shape changes due to erosion can affect whether or not flow separation occurs, and consequently impact engine efficiency. 

 Computational investigations by Professor Miller in 2004 indicated that an elliptically shaped leading edge on a modern compressor blade could stop the separation that occurred with a standard circular leading edge. This allowed the flow close to the surface to remain laminar, reducing losses and therefore improving engine efficiency. Experimental investigations of the new leading edge profiles confirmed the performance benefits suggested by the simulations. 

 The findings of the experimental investigation, supported by further numerical simulations, were published in \[R1\], showing that by switching from the standard circular leading edge to an elliptical leading edge the flow remained attached, allowing the flow close to the surface to remain laminar.  The mechanisms behind the flow features observed in \[R1\] ere investigated in \[R2\], both experimentally and computationally. It was shown in \[R2\] that the pressure close to the leading edge can exhibit a ‘spike’, and if the spike remains below a critical threshold then the separation does not occur and the engine efficiency will be unchanged. However, if the pressure spike exceeds a critical threshold, flow separation occurs, and the engine efficiency is negatively impacted. Building on the new understanding of the physical mechanisms, \[R2\] also provided design criteria for the shape of the leading edge, allowing designers to determine whether the flow over a given leading edge design would separate or not. Research in \[R3\] extended the understanding to the three\-dimensional case, and investigated the sensitivity to small geometry variations, including surface roughness, at the leading edge. The shape of the leading edge evolves over the lifetime of a blade, and \[R4\] investigated how its design shape can be made insensitive to these changes. Research in \[R3\], through considering the three\-dimensional case, showed that geometric details of the blade design, usually overlooked in the early design phases, are critical factors for overall performance and do need to be considered early in the design process.

### 1.  Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The collaborative research between University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Whittle Laboratory and Rolls\-Royce described in section 2 has increased engine efficiency, leading to fuel savings for the airline industry. It has also provided Rolls\-Royce with commercial benefit in a market where engine efficiency is a key differentiator. 

 <ins> **Fuel savings**</ins> 

 The global airline industry fuel bill has been estimated at USD188,000,000,000 in 2019, with fuel costs accounting for 23.7% of airline operating costs \[E1\]. Therefore, small fuel efficiency gains lead to enormous cost savings for aircraft operators and major competitive benefits to engine suppliers. The elliptical leading edge technology developed provides fuel savings of between 0.5% to 0.7% \[E2, E3\]. Based on the industry’s average 12.3 daily hours of utilisation for wide\-body aircrafts and an average fuel cost of USD5000 per hour, a 0.7% fuel use reduction equates to a cost saving of USD157,000 per aircraft per year \[E4, E5\]. For the nearly 1,400 aircraft in service with elliptical leading edge turbine blades, this equates to estimated fuel savings of USD219,000,000 per year that can be attributed to the developed technology. 

 <ins> **Engine designs and deliveries**</ins> 

 The elliptical leading\-edge technology, published in \[R1, R2\], was introduced first in the Trent 1000 engine \(first delivered in 2011\) after being presented to the Trent 1000 design team by Professor Miller in 2004 \[E6\]. All later generation Rolls Royce engines for wide\-body aircraft \(Trent XWB, first delivered 2014; Trent 7000, first delivered 2018\) and the latest generation of engines for business jets \(Pearl 15, first delivered 2018; Pearl 700, first delivered 2019\) were designed with the elliptical leading edge blades \[E6, E7\]. In the period since 2014, Enhanced Performance packs for the earlier generation Trent 500, 700, 800 and 900 engines have been available \[E3\] and include the elliptical leading edge blades \[E6\]. 

 The Trent engines power some of the world’s best\-known aeroplanes, including the Boeing 777 and 787, and the Airbus A330, A330neo, A340 and A380. Over the period 2014\-2020 Rolls Royce delivered nearly 2,500 engines with the elliptical leading edge \(including new designs and updates of earlier models\) \[E7, p.15\], with a further almost 2,000 engines on order as of December 2019 \[E7, p.14\]. Deliveries in the period 2014\-2019, orders at December 2019 and engines in service at December 2019 for wide\-body engines that were designed with the elliptical leading edge blades are summarised in Table 1. Of the 510 wide\-body aircraft engines delivered by Rolls\-Royce in 2019, over 90% \(466\) were designed from the outset with the elliptical leading edge blades \[E7, p.15\]. 

| **Engine** | **Aircraft** | **Year of first delivery** | **Engine deliveries 2014\-2019** | **Engines on order \(Dec 2019\)** | **Engines in\-service \(Dec 2019\)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Trent 1000** | Boeing 787 | 2011 | 667 | 246 | 658 |
| **Trent XWB 84/97** | Airbus A350 | 2014/2017 | 846 | 1,133 | 660 |
| **Trent 7000** | Airbus A330\-800/900 \(neo\) | 2018 | 114 | 576 | 80 |
| **TOTAL** ||| 1627 | 1955 | 1398 |

 Table 1: Deliveries, orders and number in service for the Rolls Royce wide\-body Trent 1000, XWB and 7000 engines equipped with the elliptical leading edge \[E7, p.14, p.15\]. 

 The elliptical leading\-edge technology has been added to Enhanced Performance pack \(EP\) revisions of the earlier generation Trent 500 \(powers the Airbus A340\), Trent 700 \(powers the Airbus A330\), Trent 800 \(powers the Boeing 777\) and Trent 900 \(powers the Airbus A380\) engines \[E6\]. EP packs are retrofitted to existing engines and included with new deliveries of older generation designs. All 216 Trent 900 engines delivered since 2014 \[E6\] have been fitted with the elliptical leading edge \[E2\]. The EP for the Trent 700 has been available since 2009, and over the period 2014\-2019 Rolls Royce delivered 595 Trent 700 engines \[E7, p.15\]. As of December 2019, there are 1,606 Trent 700 engines in operation \[E7, p.14\] and the majority are fitted with the elliptical leading edge. The fuel savings of between 0.5% and 0.7% provided by the elliptical leading edge can be quantified by measuring the efficiency of the Trent 700 and 900 engines without \(original design\) and with the elliptical leading edge blade EP packs \[E2, E3\]. 

 <ins> **Airline operators**</ins> 

 Airlines around the world operate aircraft with engines fitted with the elliptical leading edge. The Trent XWB \(exclusive power unit for the A350\) and Trent 7000 \(exclusive power unit for the A330\-800/900 \(neo\)\) engines alone are operated by 45 carriers as of June 2020 \[E8\]. The Trent XWB powered Airbus A350 was rated in 2017 as the most fuel\-efficient aircraft used on transatlantic routes \[E9, p.9\]. 

 Efficiency is a key differentiator in the aircraft engine industry, and the elliptical leading\-edge technology has helped Rolls\-Royce gain commercial benefit in this market. 

 *“In 2004 Rob Miller spent his summer in Rolls\-Royce investigating the impact of leading\-edge shape on compressor performance. This computational work showed that leading\-edge shape could cause a 20%\-30% change in the profile loss of a blade row. This led to the Trent 1000 project funding testing in the Whittle Lab that showed that leading\-edge shape could change profile loss of a blade row by 24%, and helped to support the Trent 1000 team's confidence that Elliptical Leading Edges should be implemented on the Trent 1000. This is a great example of how the long relationship between Rolls\-Royce and the Whittle Laboratory helps to ensure that technology is successfully transferred into product.”*

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant childhood brain tumour, affecting approximately 70 patients each year in the UK. Current treatment methods are aggressive and often cause long\-term, life\-limiting side effects. Research by Associate Professor Edward Schwalbe at Northumbria University has led to the development of a novel diagnostic tool that quickly and robustly identifies four recognised molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma. This rapid assay, called MIMIC \( **Mi**nimal **M**ethylation **I**n **C**ancer\), enables identification of the important WNT subgroup of patients in as little as three\-to\-four days, compared with three\-to\-four weeks for established diagnostics, making it applicable for decision making in treatment. The MIMIC assay has been used in the European PNET5 trial that investigates whether WNT patients can be treated with lower doses of radiotherapy. Adoption through the PNET5 trial means that it may reach all of the medulloblastoma patients in Europe. Of these, 20 children from 11 UK centres were found to be suitable to receive a greatly reduced dose of radiotherapy. Lower doses of radiotherapy reduce side effects and lead to better quality of life after treatment. Economic benefits from this research include income for the company providing the test, NewGene, and clinical cost decreased by half.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Schwalbe’s research is focused on improving outcomes for patients with medulloblastoma, the most common malignant childhood brain tumour, affecting approximately 70 patients each year in the UK and approximately 350 patients across Europe. Although cure rates have improved from 2% in the 1970s to approximately 75% in 2018, survivors face life\-long side effects of receiving radiotherapy to their brains, including poor general functional outcomes such as speech and hearing, a sustained drop in IQ, as well as difficulties forming relationships, completing schooling, and getting work. By improving tumour diagnostics, patients can receive treatments that are optimised for them, helping to reduce treatment side\-effects as far as possible while maintaining cure. 

 Four distinct molecular subgroups are well established: WNT, SHH, Grp3, and Grp4. Northumbria’s Schwalbe, in collaboration with colleagues from the Newcastle University research group led by Professor Steven Clifford, was the first to show how medulloblastoma could be classified into these four types through the application of DNA methylation microarrays \[ **R1**\- **R2**\]. Each group has distinct molecular, clinical, and pathological features, and patient stratification is an important step in determining the most appropriate course of treatment and follow\-up for each patient. For example, patients classified as belonging to the WNT subgroup have the most favourable outcomes and survival rates of approximately 95% \[ **R1**\], while patients with SHH subgroup tumours may benefit from specific inhibition of the SHH pathway as part of their treatment. 

 Unfortunately, the microarray route to disease profiling is difficult to implement clinically, particularly for diseases such as medulloblastoma. This is because the method requires batched assessment using multiple samples, has high sample input quality and quantity requirements, and is also expensive. To tackle these challenges, Schwalbe conceived a novel method through the characterisation of minimal DNA methylation signatures using mass\-spectrometry. The technique is called MIMIC \( **Mi**nimal **M**ethylation **I**n **C**ancer\) \[ **R1**\]. This assay is suitable for assessment of scant and/or poor quality pathological specimens, such as those acquired during surgery for routine histology, and has clear applications both to routine molecular subgrouping in patients and for unlocking previously\-inaccessible historical cohorts for contemporary molecular analysis. The technique was validated on 120 pre\-existing samples \[ **R1**\]. 

 The utility of the new MIMIC assay for informing treatment protocols via subgrouping was assessed by retrospectively applying it to samples acquired during the PNET4 medulloblastoma clinical trial \[ **R2**\]. The PNET4 trial ran from 2001\-2006 and was designed before the molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma were identified. Unfortunately, no provision was made in the trial design to collect tumour material for this type of analysis. Only formalin\-fixed, paraffin\-embedded sections and cytosine nuclear preparations on glass slides remained, more suitable for microscopy. The DNA extracted from these specimens was insufficient for conventional subgrouping but was, however, successfully analysed using MIMIC. 

 Subsequently, Schwalbe and colleagues analysed the PNET4 trial findings, taking the resulting four subgroups and using these to identify a group of tumours with distinct patterns of chromosomal gain and loss that were associated with excellent \(100%\) survival rates \[ **R3**\]. Substantial biological heterogeneity and differences in survival were apparent within each of the four subgroups. Schwalbe and Clifford investigated whether additional molecular subtypes existed within Grp3 and Grp4, and whether these could be used to improve disease subclassification and prognosis predictions \[ **R4**\]. The patient group from the PNET4 trial was analysed in the light of these novel medulloblastoma subtypes \[ **R3**\]. 

 The new molecular subtypes described in 2017 \[ **R4**\] were refined in a 2019 study that was carried out in collaboration with German Children’s Cancer Centre in Heidelberg, Germany; St Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee; and the Broad Institute in Boston, Massachusetts \[ **R5**\]. The work confirmed eight subtypes from the two subgroups \(Grp3 and Grp4\), which provides a foundation for future treatment risk stratification and clinical trial designs. 

 Schwalbe is now working to identify new subgroups by developing a DNA sequencing\-based successor to the MIMIC assay. This new assay will not only give information on molecular subgroup but will also assign novel subtypes of the four subgroups of medulloblastoma. Moreover, it will provide information on accompanying patterns of chromosomal gain and loss and, crucially, will be compatible with the upcoming reorganisation of National Health Service \(NHS\) genomic testing that is a consequence of the UK\-wide 100,000 genomes project.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Schwalbe’s research has made it more straightforward to identify medulloblastoma and classify the disease into its four major subgroups \(WNT, SHH, Grp3 and Grp4\). The assay developed for this classification can be used to support clinical practice, leading to improved treatment and better patient outcomes, ultimately reducing the burden on the NHS. 

 The four subgroups were only recognised by the World Health Organisation in 2016, which means that progress towards treatments relying on this classification is very recent. The MIMIC assay, underpinned by Northumbria’s research, enables clinically appropriate, rapid, robust, and economically viable identification of these four molecular subgroups by deploying Agena Bioscience’s Mass Array genetic testing system \[ **E1** DNA laboratory report confirms the use of MIMIC to classify Mass Array medulloblastoma data and refers to two publications by Schwalbe *et al.*\], a technique previously used for assessing mutations in cancer samples. 

 The development of the MIMIC assay has changed practice by being adopted as a subgrouping assay for the Europe\-wide PNET5 clinical trial \(trial ID: NCT02066220\) running from 2014 to 2024. This trial of standard\-risk medulloblastoma is investigating whether WNT patients can be treated with lower\-intensity therapies, aimed at minimising the side effects of treatment whilst maintaining the rate of cure. WNT patients enrolled in the trial receive a tailored and much\-reduced dose of radiotherapy, at 18Gy instead of the current standard dose of 23Gy \[ **E2**, p2\]. Simon Bailey, Chair Elect of the International Paediatric Oncology group \(SIOPE\), which designed and implemented PNET5, has confirmed the MIMIC assay *‘has enabled the routine and rapid subgrouping of tumour samples’* \[ **E3**\]. This is because of its efficacy in analysis of small sample sizes and improved turnaround times, enabling real\-time diagnosis \[ **E3**\]. 

 Adoption through the PNET5 trial means that all of the medulloblastoma patients in Europe are reached. The Royal Victoria Infirmary Hospital at Newcastle coordinates samples from 11 centres in the UK. Since 2016, it has commissioned the MIMIC assay for 56 patient samples \[ **E4**\]. Since the assay is rapid, it is compatible with clinical decision\-making. After surgical removal of the tumour, patients recover for 30 days before receiving chemo\- and/or radiotherapy, and any molecular analysis needs to be completed within this time. The Great North Children’s Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne is one of the major centres treating children with paediatric brain tumours in the UK. Simon Bailey, a Consultant in Paediatric Oncology at the hospital \(who also serves as the chair of the SIOPE trial\), stated: 

 *‘These tailored therapies can only be achieved with real time molecular diagnostics. From a clinical perspective, the turnaround time of MIMIC is much more rapid than alternative assays \(median 8 days\) \[and can be as little as three\-to\-four dates, compared to three\-to\-four weeks using previous methods\] and allows real\-time rather than retrospective decision making. The MIMIC assay has allowed clinically useful molecular subgrouping to be done robustly and rapidly, to aid treatment stratification and prognostication’* \[ **E3**\]. 

 The implementation of the assay has enabled patients with WNT subgroup medulloblastoma – a group associated with a particularly good prognosis and survival rate – to be identified and stratified into the appropriate treatment arm of the PNET5 trial. This lessens the intensity of radiotherapy. In the UK, 20 patients have been classified with WNT tumours since 2016 and were deemed to be suitable candidates to receive reduced doses of radiotherapy \[ **E3**\]. Simon Bailey confirmed: 

  

 *‘Lowering the dose of radiotherapy can lead to better patient quality of life post\-treatment, so only giving a dosage that is required and no more can have huge benefits for the patient in terms of quality of life. These tailored therapies can only be achieved with real time molecular diagnostics … The PNET5 trial is still ongoing; however, it is important to mention that no excess relapse has so far been shown in patients with lower treatment doses, with lower incidences of neurocognitive deficits being seen. In short, the use of the assay has led, so far, to more appropriate treatment doses and better outcomes for patients’* \[ **E3**\] *.* 

 The MIMIC assay is delivered using Agena Bioscience’s Mass Array genetic testing system \[ **E5**\]. Since 2016, NewGene has used this system for subgrouping medulloblastoma in the UK \[ **E6**\]. NewGene is an NHS\-accredited molecular diagnostics company. The company runs the assay to Good Clinical Laboratory Practice compliant standards for clinical samples and to a defined standard operating procedure. It also provides a clinical report in a standardised format which makes use of a classification web server developed for this project. This takes the test out of the lab and enables its use in clinical practice. Angela Silmon, The Operational Director of the Yorkshire and North East Genomic Laboratory Hub \(GLH\), said: 

 *‘Dr Schwalbe wanted to develop and optimise an assay using this platform \[Agena Bioscience’s Mass Array genetic testing system\] for the routine classification of medulloblastoma molecular subgroups using characteristic DNA methylation signatures … Dr Schwalbe developed the algorithm to classify medulloblastoma samples into molecular sub\-groups. We worked with Dr Schwalbe to optimise the assay and determine how to implement it clinically. As a result of this, it enabled NewGene to develop an expertise in a new method of detecting DNA methylation signatures without additional capital investment’* \[ **E6**\]. 

 Since 2016, NewGene has performed \[text removed for publication\] tests at a price of \[text removed for publication\] per test, giving the company new income of \[text removed for publication\] \[ **E6**\]. The economic benefits of this price extend to the user too. For example, in Spain the previous test cost nearly twice as much as MIMIC \(approximately \[text removed for publication\]\) \[ **E7**\]. 

 As a result of its use by the Yorkshire and North East Genomic Laboratory Hub \(GLH\) – an NHS service which has provided genetic analysis for inherited and acquired diseases since 2018 – the NewGene assay has become an NHS provision and elevated the profile of the GLH. Angela Silmon said: *‘This development provided the company with a competitive edge in the market and excellent international reputation and raises the profile of the Yorkshire and North East GLH. This would not have been possible without Northumbria University and Dr Ed Schwalbe’* \[ **E6**\]. 

 The wider applicability of the assay to any disease characterised by differential DNA methylation patterns has resulted in training and knowledge exchange activities for European groups. These include the Karolinska Institute \(Stockholm, Sweden\) and the Leiden University Medical Centre \(Netherlands\), working in partnership on the development of equivalent assays.

# 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Research at Heriot\-Watt University has developed, patented and demonstrated a way to extract the protein from the pot ale by\-product residue of malt whisky production and transform it into feed\-stocks for aquaculture. The impacts arising include: 

 \(A\) Creation of a spinout company Horizon Proteins Ltd \(HP\) in 2014, to exploit the new bio\-technology, supporting rural circular economies and showcased by the UK government at Milan Expo 2015; 

 \(B\) Investment of circa £5 million \(2018\) towards exploiting research and the planning and construction start of HP’s first manufacturing plant, creating skilled jobs for the rural economy \(the new plant has been designed and engineered to treat 200,000 tonnes of pot ale per annum\). 

 \(C\) Conversion of whisky by\-product residue to new feed\-stocks for aquaculture resulted in a 600% increase in the asset value of the by\-product residue; 

 \(D\) Strategic partnership with EWOS Cargill for business\-to\-business supply chain of HP feedstock for the salmon producer market; 

 \(E\) Environmental benefits in reduction of the chemical oxygen demand to treat the waste and using local sourcing for aquaculture feedstock, rather than using imports.

# 1.  Underpinning research 

 Every year, the Scottish whisky industry brings in around £5 billion in export revenue \(2019\) but produces over three billion litres of pot ale, a residual by\-product that is very challenging to dispose of. For decades, the distilling industry has been striving to develop synergy through increasing both economic and environmental sustainability. The salmon aquaculture industry, which supports 2,300 jobs directly, requires secure supplies of affordable, sustainable, high quality protein feed ingredients to realise annual salmon export revenues of around GBP800,000.000. 

 Driven by the challenges both diverse industry sectors faced, HWU researchers, led by Prof Willoughby, started in 2011 to investigate the potential of converting the residual by\-product from the whisky industry into a high quality protein feed that could serve the aquaculture sector \(e.g. the salmon industry\). This would support a strategically important rural economy sector.  The research was multi\-inter\-disciplinary, involving Engineering & Physical Sciences, Biological Chemistry, Biophysics and Bioengineering, Mechanical, Process and Energy Engineering. 

 The research challenges for the needs of both whisky and aquaculture industries were paramount in terms of the early underpinning research involving: integration with existing architecture; utilising only currently used \(and food\-safe\) materials; zero impact or perceived impact on whisky production \(exports to 175 countries and directly supporting 10,000 jobs\); and the process must first and foremost be economically and environmentally sustainable \[3.1, 3.2\]. 

 The key underpinning research was to overcome the challenge of accessing and recovering soluble protein from pot ale. As a protein resource, this was previously poorly utilised due to the inability to find a viable extraction process. From a small research project in early 2011, initial feasibility results showed promise in reversible adsorption of protein extraction using to low cost solid\-phase adsorbents. This led to funding being secured from Scottish Funding Council in late 2011 \[P1\] for a postdoctoral researcher and the commencement of a PhD project. 

 The early research work built on both the initial findings and Willoughby’s research background in developing therapeutic protein purification processes, while the postdoctoral side of the project focused on the commercial aspects, sustainability and life cycle analysis. The research findings resulted in a viable full process for recovery of protein components of value, with the critical finding \[3.3\] being the ability of the developed process to reversibly bind over 80% of the protein content of pot ale to a solid phase adsorbent, under normal pot ale discharge conditions. This protein can then be recovered as a pure solution, concentrated and dried \[3.4\]. Solid phase adsorption is a widely applied pharmaceutical and water treatment technology and is robust and easily scalable, but had never previously been used reversibly in\-situ to recover usable protein. 

 The An alternative protein processing approach, involving reversible binding and often used for recovery of therapeutic and pharmaceutical\-grade proteins, exploits reversible binding adsorbents in ion exchange chromatography. The adsorbents used in these processes, however, are far too expensive to be economically sustainable in the pot ale process, and their size and lack of rigidity would result in operationally challenging pressure drops in large scale columns. 

 Central to this technology was to identify a food\-grade adsorbent that is widely available and economically viable. In addition, this adsorbent must have a high protein binding capacity, to ensure the process was viable at scale, and must have an open, microporous and rigid structure to ensure operational robustness and low\-pressure drops at scale. After testing a number of solid phase candidates and identifying several promising possibilities, the research then moved into designing and validating a process with end\-routes for all product and by\-product streams \[3.5, 3.6\]. 

 The success of the early project in developing a viable protocol allowed securing of further funds in 2014 from Scottish Enterprise for translational research \[P2\]. This allowed the research team to design, develop and manufacture a processing plant capable of treating pot ale on\-site at distilleries. This plant was used for trials in 2015 and 2016 to improve understanding of processing conditions and to seamlessly integrate with current distillery architecture, as well as to produce enough protein to enable larger scale salmon feed trials in 2016/17. Further funding from the Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre \(IBioIC\) supported research exploring the broader potential of the technology within the grain whisky, grain spirit, US rye and bourbon processes \[P3, P4\] 

 The work was further supported via an RSE Enterprise Fellowship \(2016\) to better understand the commercial potential of the protein product in feed and food sectors. 

 The positive results in both the salmon trials and the demonstration of the process operating in distilleries allowed the commercialisation of the technology at this stage, with the IP being licenced to Horizon Proteins in 2016, and then fully assigned in 2020.

# 1.  Details of the impact 

 The impacts arising from the underpinning research are parallel increases in economic and environmental sustainability in strategic key rural industry sectors,  within both the whisky and aquaculture industries. A range of impacts have resulted involving local, national and international platforms supporting business development and key policies and strategies of the circular economy. The key impacts are as follows: 

 **\(A\) New Spinout Company: Horizon Proteins Ltd \(HP\)** 

 Researchers decided in 2014 to commercialise the emerging process and develop the research further via a spinout company. Funding was secured through Scottish Enterprise’s elite High Growth Spinout Program \(HGSP\) to support the applied research transition. Horizon Protein Ltd \(HP\) was registered as a company in 2014 \[5.1, 5.2\] and full operations of the spin\-out company commenced in 2016.  HWU staff and HP subsequently identified a route to economically separate the protein and Scottish Enterprise awarded GBP575,000 assistance \[5.2\], along with £138,000 industrial support, to refine the process in collaboration with distillers and aquafeed manufacturers \[5.3\]. At the announcement of the funding for HP, Eleanor Mitchell, Director of Commercialisation at Scottish Enterprise, said: "" *We are very excited to be supporting a project with the potential to not only create high value jobs in Scotland, but to also provide such significant value\-add to the iconic Scottish food and drink industries, salmon and whisky*"". 

 By adapting techniques more commonly applied to high\-value pharmaceutical products, HP developed the unique, cost\-effective separation and extraction process \[5.3\]. Ultimately, it has managed to transform a historically underused by\-product and increased the sustainability of various distillery processes \[5.3\]. 

 In June 2015, a key circular economy report, commissioned by Zero Waste Scotland, Scottish Government, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and enterprise agencies, which included a ‘Sector Study: Beer, Whisky and Fish’, cited Horizon Proteins \(HP\) 24 times in the document. HP was described as a prime example of a company creating a circular economy that ‘ *could offer a game\-changing opportunity’* \[5.4\] coupling both whisky and salmon industries for the important ‘ *meaningful contribution to rural economies’*, with the ‘ *pot ale by\-product* *sector valued at GBP80,000,000 being a realistic market sector value*’ \[5.4\]. The report further stated that HP is a ‘ *key development*’ and ‘ *a bonus as pot ale is in less competition with the cattle feed markets than draff. It may also offer a potential solution for smaller or isolated distilleries: Horizon Proteins is developing a form of their technology designed to operate at smaller scales’*. 

 In 2015 Horizon Proteins were invited by Scottish government to showcase their pioneering circular economy approach for the food and drink by\-product sectors at the Milan Expo 2015 \[5.5\]. In 2016, HP was a case study cited by Arup Associates in a Mayor of London report ‘Circular and Sharing Economy’, as a specific example of an industry converting organic waste to proteins \[5.6\]. 

 **\(B\)  Joint venture with Rothes CoRDe to build HPL Manufacturing Plant** 

 Further key investment was raised in 2018, as a result of HP being engaged with the top two companies \(Diageo and Pernod Ricard\) producing more than 60% \(by production volume\) of Scottish whisky output. Funding of GBP4,000,000 was raised to support the construction of Horizon Proteins’ first manufacturing plant, as a joint venture with Rothes CoRDe Ltd, on their site in Rothes, Scotland \[5.7\]. Funders included SiccaDania Venture \[5.8\], Danish high\-net\-worth individuals and the Scottish Investment Bank. 

 **\(C\)  New Production Plant \- £4m investment supporting rural economy and jobs** 

 The construction process for this plant is underway \(<ins>delayed due to COVID\-19</ins>\) and will initially be able to treat 200,000 tonnes of pot ale per annum to produce around 2,500 tonnes per annum \(tpa\) of sustainable protein, expanding in 2023 to full capacity of 1 million tpa of pot ale and 12,000 tonnes tpa of sustainable protein. This plant has been designed to produce revenues of GBP2.25m initially, projected to rise to GBP11.25m at full capacity. 

 EWOS Cargill have agreed to purchase all of the initial protein, with a specific Scottish salmon farming customer as the first key client \[5.9\]. The construction of this plant will create around 10 skilled jobs in the Speyside rural area associated with the plant, as well as supporting in\-direct supply chain roles \(transport etc.\). 

 **\(D\) Economic Added Value** 

 The Horizon Proteins research project was designed from inception to maximise economic impact for rural areas and researcher staff engaged key stakeholders from the whisky, aquaculture and feed industries as an advisory panel to guide direction. Researchers have engaged with the whisky industry through the Scotch Whisky Research Institute \(SWRI\) and the major trade body the Scotch Whisky Association \(SWA\), to ensure that all distillers had an input. The three major aquafeed manufacturers in Scotland, EWOS Cargill, BioMar and Skretting, were all involved in the project during its development and all three offered to carry out commercial trials of the final product. This early engagement ensured that the commercial impact pathway of the developed process was maximised. 

 Extraction of this protein transforms the accessible value of these liquid waste by\-products.  They are worth around GBP3/tonne as pot ale sold as syrup, but this increases to GBP20/tonne, when reconstructed into the Horizon Proteins dried products, resulting in an over 600% increase \[5.3\]. 

 **\(E\) Environmental Benefits** 

 The HP process enables a reduction in the chemical oxygen demand \(COD\) to treat the waste and reduces the needs for imported \(non\-UK sourced\) aquafeed. The technology is now seen as a crucial element in the development of a circular bioeconomy and specifically ‘upcycling’ in Scotland \[5.4\]. The technology reduces environmental pollution, allows for re\-use of water, lowers by\-product processing costs and provides a sustainable source of protein for fish for a growing global population \[5.1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at Bangor University has supported a significant regulatory change in interchange and merchant fees of payment cards in the European Union \(EU\) between 2013 and 2016. Acceptance of card payment platforms by both cardholders and merchants was essential for increasing the use of electronic payments in the EU to integrate payment systems for EU countries. By demonstrating that lowering interchange and merchant discount fees would be beneficial to all parties and by providing evidence critical to EU decision\-making concerned with regulatory changes, Carbo\-Valverde’s research led to reduced fees from June 2015. These changes benefitted all merchants that use electronic payments, and all cardholders and financial institutions across Europe, with annual savings between 2015 and 2017 of EUR1,200,000,000 \(03\-2020\) for EU merchants and EUR587,000,000 \(03\-2020\) for EU consumers. The findings are also directly benefitting other, non\-EU jurisdictions.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The EU payment card market totals 30% of the global market, second only to the USA. Despite this, before 2010, a significant proportion of merchants in the European Union was reluctant to accept card payments due to high interchange and merchant discount fees. ‘Interchange fees’ \(a fee paid by the retailer's bank to the consumer's bank upon the use of credit, debit or prepaid cards\) generally increase the price of goods as retailers incorporate these costs into the prices they charge consumers. Carbo\-Valverde’s research showed that even small reductions in these fees resulted in significant increases in merchant acceptance that were beneficial to all parties \(merchants, consumers and financial institutions\). 

 In a unique empirical case study conducted between 2012 and 2015, led by Carbo\-Valverde at Bangor University in collaboration with the University of Grenada, Spain, researchers explored the effects of lowering interchange and merchant fees in Europe. The research empirically tested the fundamental predictions of the two\-sided market theoretical payment card models regarding the impact of interchange fee reductions on payment card adoption and use. Previous theoretical literature had failed to account of environmental changes \(such as lower technology costs, increased consumer and merchant awareness, and increased scale and scope of economic benefits arising from increased payment volumes\).  Data on merchant acceptance, the number of cardholders, and transaction volumes were used for the first time. Employing the data in this way revealed the effects of changes in interchange and merchant discount fees on merchant acceptance and usage of payment cards. Data were drawn from Spain, a card payment market that had not reached its maturity due to low merchant acceptance, where a lowering of the interchange fees could still result in demonstrable higher merchant acceptance. 

 Several working paper versions \(for official use by banks only and not for publication\) were presented at various high\-level conferences and seminars between 2012 and 2015. These were circulated to both European Commission and European Central Bank officials, informing and influencing key stakeholders at the research stage who would later introduce a new Europe wide regulation affecting credit and debit card markets.  Published in the *Review of Economics and Statistics* in 2016 \[3.1\], the research provides the only existing empirical evidence explaining the distribution of the benefits for merchants, consumers and other stakeholders on how regulatory changes affect the benefits for all market participants. Results showed even small changes to the interchange fees were beneficial in terms of merchant acceptance. For example, a decrease of 10% in the rate of decline in the average interchange fee resulted in an increase of up to 1.4% in the rate of merchant acceptance every quarter the reduction was in place. Also, an increase of 10% in merchant acceptance resulted in an increase of up to 1.7% in the rate of electronic payment volumes. The most significant insight of Carbo\-Valverde’s research was to demonstrate that merchants benefit from a fee reduction in terms of higher payment efficiency, higher sales, and lower merchant fees while consumers benefit from higher convenience and availability of card payment devices at stores, and financial institutions and banks benefit, particularly when acting as issuers, from higher volumes that more than compensated for the fall in fees. 

#####  Other related findings 

 In a related paper \[3.2\], Carbo\-Valverde’s research demonstrated that the merchant acceptance rate of card payments in China was negatively affected by high interchanges fees. Additionally, Carbo\-Valverde’s research \[3.3\] showed that the possibility of using cards at Automated Teller Machines \(ATMs\) to withdraw cash was significantly slowing down the pace of expanding payment cards at shops and retailers.

###  4. Details of the impact 

#####  Influence upon EU institutions, regulation and policy 

 Since 2012, the EU aimed for a more integrated payment systems area on the continent. In this context, expanding the electronic card payments systems was a key part of the strategy since higher efficiency and lower costs for all parties could be achieved. The European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European Central Bank \(ECB\) instigated a public debate about how to make a substantial increase in merchant acceptance possible. Carbo\-Valverde presented his research as working paper versions \(subsequently published in 2016, \[3.1\]\) at various high\-level conferences and seminars, for example to the ECB in 2014 \[5.1\]. The audience included ECB officials, European Commission officials, antitrust authority officials and bank representatives of various EU countries, all of whom were relevant parties and policy makers in the later design of the new EU regulation on interchange fees. Following the seminars, the ECB and European Commission used the research to support the design of new regulatory actions and to explain the gains from those new regulations. At the early research stage, as the only existing empirical evidence explaining the distribution of the benefits of regulatory changes for all market participants, Carbo\-Valverde’s working papers were pivotal in influencing the new regulation and have been cited in relevant policy actions. Consequently, a new regulation to lower interchange and merchant fees was formulated and approved, becoming applicable in the EU between 8 June 2015 and 9 June 2016. 

 Various testimonials attest how, as the first empirical research to address the issue of interchange fees, Carbo\-Valverde’s work significantly influenced the EC’s decision to implement the Interchange Fees Regulation and his contributions were central in guiding EC policy development and application. Referring to the influence of Carbo\-Valverde’s work, the Acting Director\-General of Competition of the European Commission states how it ‘has been part of the supportive academic empirical background that the European Commission used for the change in the way interchange and merchant fees were regulated in the European Union… The Impact Assessment study of the European Commission for the Directive on Interchange Fees quotes Mr Carbo\-Valverde’s research that provided evidence for these policy actions’ \[5.2\]. 

 The ECB recommendation \(followed by the EC and the European Parliament\) to lower interchange and merchant discount fees instigated the introduction of regulation by all EU countries to lower those fees and set them close to zero from 2016 onwards.  The Head of the Market Infrastructure Support Division at the ECB \(Directorate General Market Infrastructure and Payments\), emphasised the influence of the research on ‘retail payments policy\-related work of the ECB’. Their testimony demonstrates the use of the research by a former member of the ECB Governing Board ‘in several public statements’ suggesting, overall that ‘Carbo\-Valverde’s research provided research background for that change in regulation \(…\) that affected all banks operating in the EU, all merchants that use electronic payments in the EU, and EU cardholders’. The Head of the Market Infrastructure Support further adds ‘The research was also used as motivation in the impact assessment study of the European Commission and the European Parliament for the Directive on Interchange fees and merchant discount fees’ \[5.1\]. 

 In 2016, the European Commissioner for Competition also used the research to motivate a response to the European Parliament on the convenience to reduce interchange fees in Portugal \[5.3\]. The European Commissioner’s response states: ‘various studies have also shown that interchange fee reductions led to higher card acceptance and usage’ and directly links to a footnote that mentions Carbo\-Valverde’s research. 

 A Senior Economist of the Central Bank of the Netherlands stated that the research ‘has also produced a significant impact for academic discussion and among central banks and regulatory bodies’. He  adds: ‘… these results \(those of Carbo\-Valverde\) were cited by different and European authorities and were considered and explicitly mentioned in the impact case study of the European Commission and European Central Bank as a basis for the directive on Interchange Fee Regulation and merchant discount fees. The directive implied a fundamental change for all market participants in the card payment network in the EU countries. It affected 100% of banks operating in the European Union, 100% of merchants that use electronic payments in the EU and 100% of EU cardholders’ \[5.4\]. 

#####  Significance of economic effects 

 Earlier versions of the research \(for official use only and not for distribution\) were already considered as an indication of potentially significant economic effects and informed the findings of the impact assessment study of the EC and the European Parliament for the Directive on Interchange Fees \[5.5\]. The subsequent benefits of implementation of the 2015 EU Interchange Fees Regulation for consumers and merchants are widespread. Notably, by reducing the costs of card payments retailers pay less for such transactions, allowing consumers to use cards more widely, paving the way for innovative payment technologies to be rolled out \[5.6\]. The EC study on the application of the Interchange Fee Regulation \(IFR\) \(impact study of 2020\) corroborates the large benefits of the regulation change: ‘the increase in the usage of commercial cards has also been confirmed by merchants …. \(a\) majority …. \(86%\) that responded to the survey declared that the relative share of transactions performed with commercial cards has increased since entry into force of the IFR. More precisely, 54% of merchants reported an increase in commercial card transactions between 0 and 10%, 18% declared an increase above 10%’ \[5.7\]. The impact study concludes that after the implementation of the new EU interchange fee regulation there is significant evidence of card payments gradually replacing cash payments. Focusing on end\-users \(consumers and merchants\), this increase has resulted in estimated annual benefits \(between 2015 and 2017\) of EUR1,200,000,000 \(03\-2020\) for merchants and EUR587,000,000 \(03\-2020\) for consumers \[5.7\]. 

#####  Influence in other jurisdictions 

 Finally, the impact of Carbo\-Valverde’s research has more recently expanded to non\-EU countries. Several non\-European government agencies have cited Carbo’s Valverde research in the context of their changes in interchange fee regulations. These include the USA Federal Reserve \(introduction of a new regulation called the US Debit Card Interchange Regulation in the context of the Durbin Amendment, 2017\) \[5.8\], the Bank of Canada \(2019\) \[5.9\] and the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs of Malaysia \(2018\) \[5.10\]. All these countries have lowered or set a limit on interchange fees since 2017. These institutions cite Carbo\-Valverde’s research as the empirical background to demonstrate the benefits of lowering interchange fees.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Ever\-increasing internet bandwidth is required to support streaming and real\-time content, as well as growth in internet connected devices.  This requires a new generation of Internet routers to provide quality of service and secure content delivery. 

 Netronome, whose customers include the world’s largest equipment vendors e.g. Dell, Cisco, is a world leader in high performance networking solutions. Netronome incorporated UoA research on high\-performance management of internet traffic into its products, resolving the key challenge of tracking millions of simultaneous internet traffic flows. 

 Netronome’s turnover consequently increased by over GBP\[text removed for publication\] per year with customers experiencing latency reduction and increased capacity per server node. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Emerging highly cloud centric services, collecting information from and providing services to an expanding number of highly diverse and dispersed wireless and mobile communication devices, users and sensors, require communication networks that are dynamic, secure and deliver high Quality of Service. Such networks rely on smart network nodes built upon custom purpose processing known as Software Defined Networking \(SDN\) and Network Function Virtualisation \(NFV\) to achieve acceleration. 

 The UoA \(from 2008 to 2016, Sezer, Scott\-Hayward\) developed research in lookup algorithms that provide fast memory\-access, packet classification, parallel packet processing, and shared packet buffer architectures, akin to ultra–high speed phone book searching but across enormous volumes of internet traffic at exceptionally high speed. 

 The main research focus here has been the creation of highly parallel and pipelined custom integrated circuits and associated algorithms. The research has resolved key challenges of decomposing and scaling the highly data\-dependent and memory\-centric problem of lookup of multiple IP packet headers and tracking of millions of simultaneous IP traffic flows in a way that enables sustainable and scalable performance. 

 A software programmable hardware\-based approach for fine\-grain parallelisation was developed which resolved the latency and bandwidth related constraint of traditional software\-based solutions of Open Virtual Switching \(OvS\) and Software Defined Networking \(SDN\). 

  

 The core innovations from QUB research that enabled these significant advances in Internet packet and flow classification technology, while extending this technology for Software Defined Networks are: 

-  US Patent: 13/929,809 **R\[1\],** this work showed that it is possible to manage network traffic data by performing parallel lookup operations on subfields of the network traffic data. A lookup result analyzer then determines whether additional inspection of the traffic data is required. 

-  Hybrid Packet Classification Architecture comprised of several configurable lookup algorithms that can be tailored \(memory utilisation vs lookup latency vs lookup bandwidth\) at runtime for various packet classification applications and traffic types **R\[2 – 5\].** 

-  Hardware accelerated exact match lookup for memory\-efficient packet flow processing US patent 14/151,730, utilising the efficient use of embedded distributed memory technology, as intermediate lookup cache and external memory as the main storage for flow tables **R\[6\].**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Netronome is located in Silicon Valley, California, USA and employs over 200 highly skilled engineers. Netronome is a leading developer and vendor of high\-performance networking solutions for cloud, data centre, service provider and enterprise communications products **S\[1\]**. 

 The above outlined innovations **R\[1\]\-R\[6\]** have been translated in collaboration with Netronome into successful packet and network processing technologies that now underpin NFV/SDN enabled network and cloud products, providing programmable and secure multi\-gigabit networking functions. 

 The impacts resulting are: 

1.  Technological Impact – Netronome has released NFV and SDN related products for Data Centre and Internet Security appliances with improved power efficiency and data throughout, thereby reducing overall processing latency. 

1.  Economic Impact – close research partnership enabled Netronome to be a market innovator in Network Flow Processor technology leading to an increased turnover of over GBP\[text removed for publication\] per year \(associated with products for the NFV and SDN appliance market\). 

 Netronome has been working with Queen’s University Belfast Electronics, Communications and Information Technology Research Institute ECIT since 2011, in what has become an exemplar of University/Industry partnership. Netronome has invested over USD\[text removed for publication\] into ECIT research since then, **specifically targeting the advancement and commercial development of novel algorithms for accelerating network security processing and high\-speed IP flow classification for Netronome’s** \[text removed for publication\] **S\[2\]**. Netronome has been able to take full advantage of QUB’s research facilities, PhD programmes, key skill sets and also research innovations in network and flow processing technologies. 

 Initial engagement with Netronome \(2011\) targeted the core competencies at QUB in lookup acceleration for packet and flow classification and flow processing. Follow\-on engagements with Netronome \(from 2013\) were mainly focused on specific technological challenges, such as \[text removed for publication\]. This resulted in research contracts and a strong impact focussed partnership with Netronome. 

 **Netronome’s Chief Operating Officer \(COO\) said, **“From Netronome’s perspective, the standout expertise of the research team led by Professor Sezer lies in their profound understanding of traditional technological constraints impairing performance and latency of high\-speed search and lookup functions. The team has developed several novel search architectures overcoming such technological barriers**… **many of these innovations have been successfully optimized by \[QUB\] for Netronome’s flow processor technology and deployed by the Netronome Agilio product family for a wide range of Network Security and SDN systems**”* **S\[2\]**. 

 The strength of this partnership has combined the research capability at QUB with the market leading products of Netronome, resulting in the world’s first solution to the highly complex problem of creating a high performance, low cost, IP flow classification solution that is being applied to today’s SDN products. **Netronome have stated that,** *“ **Without this patented research and breakthrough at QUB, such a solution would not be possible**”* **S\[2\]**. 

 **The Netronome COO** has confirmed the reach of these products, and the benefit seen by Netronome *: **“Netronome’s networking solutions incorporating \(ECIT\) innovations are being widely used by the world’s largest network equipment vendors, delivering worldwide secure internet services**. **These technological advances have ultimately led to an increase in Netronome’s turnover of over** \[text removed for publication\] **per annum**”* **S\[2\]**. 

 Key Netronome clients using the Agilio product family include Dell EMC, Ericsson, and Juniper Networks, sample customers are listed in **S\[3\],** with core technology partners in **S\[4\].** 

 The direct benefit for Netronome customers aligning with the core QUB research **R\[4\]\-R\[6\]** are: 

-  Reduction of latency when compared with traditional Software based solutions 

-  Significant increase of traffic bandwidth per server node 

-  Effective utilisation of Datacentre computing \(CPU\) resources for application rather than for virtual switching. 

 As an example, Red Hat, a world\-leading provider of open\-source software solutions, partnered with Netronome to offer a new cloud and NFV infrastructure solution to boost efficiency for Red Hat’s Enterprise Linux and OpenStack Platform users. A partner solution brief on Red Hat’s website **S\[5\]** explains “ **Netronome’s programmable network flow processor delivers on\-demand acceleration with traditional Ethernet services. By working with the open\-source community to develop standard application programming interfaces for SmartNICs \(network interface cards that offload processing tasks that the system CPU would normally handle\), Netronome and Red Hat offer breakthrough efficiencies in data centre and cloud\-based computing”.**

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Brighton \(UoB\) research has used visual and participatory communication methods to engage and mobilise activists, artists, young people and citizens in UK, Europe, South Africa and Mauritius. It has forged collective spaces for community, artistic and activist expressions on globally important socio\-political and environmental issues including conflict, state suppression, social justice, HIV/AIDS and climate change. This research has advanced collective solidarity and agency within diverse groups and organisations including artist collectives and youth climate activists; created new forms of cultural connection and activist engagement including the involvement of young people in different countries; and changed organisational communication and working practices including in Greenpeace. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Researchers in the UoB Centre for Spatial, Environmental and Cultural Politics have collectively developed research that focuses upon the visual as a mode of cultural representation and participatory practice to address knowledge gaps in environmental, social movements and arts communication research. 

 UoB researchers interrogate the visual as a critical representational practice in climate communication and social activism. Through foundational work in climate communications, Doyle has shown how media, visual culture and science has representationally shaped climate knowledge and action, rendering climate change as a distant future through the separation of humans and culture from nature \[reference 3.1\]. Doyle contends that cultural and visual communication about climate change \(through media, arts and activism\) can present more nuanced understandings of human\-environmental relations that link climate change to the cultural politics of the everyday \[3.2, 3.7\]. Addressing a key gap in social movement studies, Jenzen has written extensively on the role of aesthetics and the visual in social activism \[3.3, 3.4\] funded by the AHRC project *The Aesthetics of protest: Visual culture and communication in Turkey* \[3.8\]. Focussing on social media, Jenzen’s research demonstrated how Gezi Park protestors in Turkey \(2013\) used visual and performative forms of communication, to communicate their messages, mobilise supporters and shape the movement’s identity. The research not only evidenced emerging new forms of visual rhetoric \[3.4\] and modes of protest against state suppression but also identified how the movement aimed for social transformation via prefigurative enactments \[3.3\] of new ways of relating to others in society. These practices were documented and disseminated in visual forms. The legacies of such practices are exemplified in the artist collectives and collaborative activist art practices presented in the AHRC project exhibition \(Istanbul 2017\) and that were commissioned by the project to respond to the research findings, by exploring collective modes of protest, being and ways of life. 

 UoB researchers also utilise the visual as a collaborative creative practice to forge new cultural meanings and to empower marginalised and disparate communities. Ashmore’s research uses collaborative activist art practice \- through the act of making – to demystify artistic practices and processes, and to foster solidarity and socio\-political engagement \[3.5, 3.9, 3.11\]. Using film, exhibition and public engagement activities, Ashmore investigates how the historically and culturally specific moment of war and conflict at Guernica is translated to a different experience through the collective community\-based remaking of Picasso’s *Guernica* in UK, South Africa, Mauritius, Syria, Canada, America, Iraq and Afghanistan. In bringing together disparate remakings of *Guernica*, Ashmore’s exhibitions and films highlight contemporary concerns about war, conflict, the HIV/AIDS crisis, displaced people, and peace movements \[3.5, 3.6\]. Similarly, Doyle’s research has deployed creative ‘making’ methods of visual arts, speculative storytelling, and participatory play to engage young people in the UK and Europe with climate change. This interdisciplinary visual research has facilitated young people’s socio\-cultural and emotional engagements with climate change, increased their feelings of individual and collective efficacy, and enabled the enactment of futures thinking \[3.2, 3.10, 3.12\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Addressing a range of challenging socio\-political and environmental issues, including conflict, HIV/AIDS, state suppression and climate change, our visual and participatory communication research has brought together individuals and forged spaces to mobilise collaborative dialogue and reflection across diverse communities and organisations in the UK, Turkey, Austria, Germany, Belgium, South Africa and Mauritius. In doing so, our researchers have built relationships and advanced a sense of collective solidarity and agency; created new forms of cultural expression and activist engagement with social and environmental issues; and changed the communication and working practices of arts and environmental campaign organisations. 

##  4.1 Advancing collective solidarity and agency 

 Ashmore’s *Guernica* banner remaking project \(2012\-2014\) started by involving 12 artists and activists from Brighton and 14 public collaborative sewings in England \(V&A, London; Working Class Movement Library, Salford\) and India \(National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad\). The subsequent *Guernica Remakings* combined research and practice to build from a smaller scale banner remaking project to a global collective of remakers. This significantly expanded the geographical reach and scale of its impact across diverse communities and organisations. Through creative workshops and exhibition tours that have brought together 9 international artists, 14 local communities, and 11 cultural organisations in the UK, India, Mauritius and South Africa, Ashmore’s *Guernica Remakings* has created visual outputs and vital spaces for collaborative reflection upon challenging issues within and across specific locales and cultures. Comprised of maker workshops, public talks and reflections on the making process – facilitated by Ashmore’s film documentation of these processes \[5.1\] – the differing spaces have built trusting relationships and given voice to marginalised groups beyond their locale. Commissioning the Keiskamma Art Project \(KAP\) in South Africa to create Keiskamma Guernica, Ashmore’s documentary series *Guernica Remakings, South Africa* \(2018\) followed those involved in its making, discussing local Xhosa cultural iconography and textiles. The remaking process enabled the sharing of lived experiences of not only conflict in Southern Africa but also the effects of the HIV/AIDS crisis. The documentary positively impacted upon the wellbeing of 100 members of the KAP collective, creating a space for the wider community to remember conflict and to tell their stories without fear or stigma. It also influenced the way KAP supports artists living with grief linked to the HIV/AIDS crisis by encouraging the use of counselling services available, and selling their art work \[5.1\]. 

 Doyle’s climate communications research was central to the creation of a transformative climate learning retreat in St Gilgen, Austria that brought together 20 young adults and youth climate activists from 8 European countries \(Sweden, Germany, Finland, Austria, England, Scotland and Netherlands, Belgium\) to co\-create their own forms of climate communications. Co\-designed by Doyle and the project partners, the multidimensional retreat combined climate science information with participatory workshops on climate communications research and embodied reflections, to explore young people’s personal, emotional and collective responses to climate change. In sharing their *‘grief and emotions about the \[climate\] work we are doing’,* the young people *‘felt empowered’.* Agency was created through *‘this community that came together in St. Gilgen’,* and the positive *‘feeling of connectedness to other people who are keen on changing the world and this feeling that I am not alone’* \[5.2\]. Forging a collective identity, the young people established themselves as the ‘St Gilgen Climate Collective’, the legacy of which continues to sustain their climate activism through building ‘ *confidence to stand up for what I believe in*’ and applying the retreat experiences in *‘everyday life*’ \[5.2\]. Climate communications learning from the retreat has *‘been used in real life* *campaigns*’, through the use of humour as a communication device in a Scottish Government food waste campaign \[5.3\] 

 Jenzen’s research has mobilised the artists’ collective to solidify their identity in art practice providing an enduring mode of visual and other forms of political expression beyond protest action that has been suppressed by state authorities. This has particular significance in contemporary Turkey where some Gezi Park protestors are still being persecuted by the state and there is a power struggle between conservative neoliberal capitalist politics and an awakening to collective, emancipative values. For example, 4 Turkish artist collectives were asked to respond to Jenzen et al’s social protest imagery research and the prevailing legacies of the protest in Turkish society. These groups of artists, some of whom had not worked together before as collectives, challenged the notion of individualism, and explored cultural forms linked to the ‘Gezi spirit’ \- the communal and pluralist ethos of the social movement \- beyond the effervescent uprising of protest. The subsequent exhibition captured this via a set of artworks on the theme of collectivity as a ‘field of solidarity’, homing in on the importance of shared creative work in the context of contemporary Turkish authoritarian politics and neoliberal capitalist art market. The work and the exhibition experience consolidated them as 4 artist collectives through which they have continued to produce collaborative work and continued to centre on questions of the meaning and opportunities of collectivity in society especially in response to state oppression \[5.4\]. The HAH collective \(an Istanbul based artist collective with 6 members\) reflected, ‘ *The work we did after was always relational, participatory, inviting others*’, and their collective identity has helped make ‘ *a stance against the* \[capitalist\] *art market’* \[5.5\]. The Dadans collective has also experienced more openness to collective modes of working after the exhibition: *‘It was the first exhibition to \[include us\] as an art collective. \[At the time\] the art scene wasn’t open to collectives. Festivals said no. \[But\] we got a lot of interviews after the exhibition*’. 

##  4.2 Creating new cultural connections and forms of activist engagement 

 Each installation of the *Guernica Remakings* Exhibition responds to its location by incorporating contextual materials and inviting local artist and public responses to the work. At the National Poetry Library, London \(2019\) two poets were commissioned by Ashmore and Chris McCabe, National Poetry Librarian, to write a poetic response to the exhibition which, alongside a public reading, impacted public participation with the work \[5.6\] and saw over 30 visual and poetic responses from the general public to the call “what is your Guernica?”. People displayed their work in the dedicated display space in the exhibition. Ashmore’s *Guernica Remakings* project has initiated further cultural iterations across 3 countries \(UK, South Africa, Mauritius,\) involving 9 individual artists and 4 artist collectives. Saradha Soobrayen’s *Chagosnica* \(2017 – 2019\) \- exploring the conflict linked to the forcible removal of Chagossians from the Chagos islands by the UK government between 1971 – 1973 \- was inspired by the *Guernica Remakings* 2017 exhibition in Brighton \[5.7\]. Ashmore collaborated on the 2019 tour to Salford and London UK; and Rose Hill, Mauritius with 3 international artists and 5 artists from the Keiskamma Art Project, local Mauritian arts organisation pARTage and children’s charity Future Hope, Mauritius. This enabled 50 children from disadvantaged families in Port Louis, Mauritius \(many of whom do not go to school\) to explore their visions of the future and promote a message of peace over conflict, through the production of their own *Kids Guernica, Mauritius* \(2019\) on a large scale canvas, commissioned by Ashmore. The *Kids Guernica, Mauritius* has since been exhibited in Japan to mark the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the *Kids Guernica* project, also coinciding with Hiroshima day to mark the day the atomic bomb was dropped. Exhibited outdoors in a public place alongside tens of other Kids Guernica’s created globally, thousands of people saw the *Kids Guernica* exhibition and the Mauritius contribution. The collaborative art making process for *Kids Guernica, Mauritius*, helped facilitate dialogue ‘ *between different cultures, respecting each identity...to create a community all around the world with children*’ \[5.6\]. 

 Utilising collaborative making for social change, a group of young adults at the St Gilgen climate learning retreat created a new prototype for a climate friendly travel app – Vojo \( [https://vojo.me](https://vojo.me/)\) – which is now an official start up entity in Germany, supported by an Accelerator programme UNLEASH\+ \[5.8\]. One of the Vojo team was subsequently selected to become a participant of the Sail to the COP25 campaign \(2019\): a group of 36 young changemakers from Europe who sailed to the UN conference in Chile \(mirroring Greta Thunberg\) to call for policy on fair and sustainable travel \( [https://www.sailtothecop.com](https://www.sailtothecop.com/)\). 

 Although the conference was cancelled, the young people continued their journey across the Atlantic to raise awareness of climate change and sustainable travel. 

##  4.3 Changing organisational communication and working practices 

 UoB’s visual and participatory research on socio\-political and environmental issues has changed the communication and working practices of arts and environmental campaign organisations in the UK and Europe. Doyle’s research collaborations with UK arts charity ONCA has expanded its *‘vocabulary around climate agency and efficacy*’, helped ‘ *develop holistic approaches’* to climate education, influenced its ‘ *emerging organisational values around anti\-racist and inclusive practice’,* deepened its local collaborations *,* and increased its international research profile \[5.9\]. Through Jenzen et al’s collaborative research the Birbucuk collective in Turkey \(focusing upon climate change\) has moved from singular artist/activist collective into the role of facilitator for work and dialogue across multiple collectives to accelerate social justice and change towards environmental sustainability \[5.5\]. Both HAH and Dadans in Turkey now focus on interactive work concerned with how citizens relate to each other in a capitalist authoritarian state \[5.5\]. Birbucuk now enable public interaction over issues of social justice via larger events, including the Istanbul Biennale, where previously they worked in ‘closed’ circles accessible only by invitation / membership. \[5.4\]. This has brought their activism to new and larger publics. Doyle’s research has also affected the communication practices of international environmental NGO Greenpeace. Following an invitation to present the research to Greenpeace UK \(November 2013\), Former Deputy Head of Greenpeace UK Campaigns, stated that *‘Doyle’s presentation at Greenpeace UK initiated an internal discussion about how we best talk about climate change and what images we use when we do so’.* Doyle’s research helped its Programme Director *‘to democratise the discussion that we are currently having in Greenpeace Australia’,* and *‘to shift ‘ownership’ of our communications to a more participatory and democratic mode that previously was the preserve of the self appointed few*’ \[5.10\].
