 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Sheffield team has developed the **HeadUp Collar**, a revolutionary new cervical orthosis device that provides support for neck weakness caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \(ALS\). Originally designed and realised with ALS patient involvement from its conception, the collar has shown to be superior to alternative options and has directly impacted on the quality of life and well\-being of patients and their carers world\-wide. It was licenced to TalarMade, a UK SME, in 2017 and is a world\-wide commercial success with in\-excess of 2,500 units sold globally since its launch in 2018. The impact of the HeadUp Collar has been recognised by the 2020 Queen Anniversary Awards.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Note: The HeadUp Collar orthosis to which this impact case refers was named the Sheffield Support Snood during the development phase. 

 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \(ALS\), known in the UK as motor neuron disease \(MND\) is a progressive degenerative fatal neuromuscular disease that is caused by degeneration of motor neurones. Symptoms include muscle weakness and wasting, resulting in progressive paralysis. ALS/MND sufferers typically die within two to three years from diagnosis due to respiratory arrest. As the disease is incurable, the efforts to support patients are heavily focused on sustaining a maximum quality of life. 

 For patients with ALS/MND, when the muscle groups that co\-ordinate to support and control head movements begin to weaken, the head drops or flops, usually forwards and/or sideways; it is estimated that up to 80% of people with ALS/MND experience head drop at some point in the illness. Head drop exacerbates problems with swallowing, breathing, eating/drinking and communication. This significant disability has a major negative impact on well\-being. Current practice and guidelines recommend the use of neck orthoses for people with ALS/MND to counteract this. 

 Sheffield research highlighted that existing cervical orthoses provided for neck weakness in people living with ALS/MND are either too soft \(and therefore do not provide sufficient head support\) or too stiff \(and cause excessive restriction of head movements\) \[R1\]. In response, the Sheffield team instigated an interdisciplinary, participatory co\-design process informing the development of a novel head and neck support for people living with progressive neck muscle weakness caused by ALS/MND. The HeadUp Collar was developed in collaboration with people living with ALS/MND, their families and ALS/MND healthcare professionals. User engagement in this process fundamentally changed the course of the project and some ideas were ruled out as a result of patient perspectives. The benefits of this participatory process, through workshops, illustrated in the strongest possible affirmation that researchers were listening. 

 This novel orthosis is specifically designed to make it easier for patients to carry out everyday tasks such as eating, driving and communication allowing freedom of movement whilst giving support to muscle weakness. It can be customised to provide support where it is needed most and to adapt to the changing needs of the patient \[R2\] \(Figure 1\). 

 *Figure 1: The HeadUp Collar*
 

 An initial evaluation in 20 ALS/MND patients identified key beneficial features of the HeadUp Collar compared to a range of existing supports used by the test subjects: notably, increased support while providing a greater range of movement, flexibility of use, and improved appearance and comfort \[R3, R4\]. The results of this evaluation highlight the value of the HeadUp Collar as an alternative option for people with ALS/MND, and potentially other patient groups who require a neck orthosis. 

 The Sheffield team went on to perform the first objective functional quantification of head movement impairment in 15 ALS/MND patients which quantitatively confirmed a general limitation in the ability of the ALS/MND patients to perform and control head movements \[R4\]. Using this validated quantitative assessment of head movement, the Sheffield team proceeded to show efficacy of the HeadUp Collar in facilitating functional head movements in 13 patients with ALS/MND \[R5\]. 

 A subsequent larger assessment of the HeadUp Collar in 139 patients with neck weakness from 10 centres in the UK and Ireland confirmed these results. The HeadUp Collar scored significantly better \(p<0.005\) than previous collars used by patients in terms of satisfaction, level of support offered, residual head movement possible, appearance, and lack of interference with eating and drinking. There was a strong preference for the HeadUp Collar reported by individuals with ALS/MND and by healthcare practitioners. This study also reported that patients with a range of causes for head drop other than ALS/MND also benefited from the HeadUp Collar \[R6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Impacts include: health and welfare, public policy and services, practitioners and services, commercial. Main beneficiaries include: patients, industry, NHS. 

 Researchers and physiotherapists found that many patients with muscle weakness through ALS/MND would not wear their collars due to their discomfort and difficulty of use \[R1\]. The Sheffield team led a collaborative project to address the needs identified, bringing together patients, their families, researchers and designers to ensure a design of a collar truly fit for purpose \[R1, R2\]. The resulting HeadUp Collar is significantly improving patients’ lives and is a commercial success. The impact of the HeadUp Collar has been recognised by the 2020 Queen Anniversary Awards for research that has improved patient outcomes for people living with some of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases \[S1\]. 

 Improved quality of life of ALS/MND patients and their carers 

 The HeadUp Collar was launched in December 2017 at the International ALS/MND symposium in Boston, USA and has significantly improved the quality of life of ALS/MND patients. In the ‘100 Collars’ project the HeadUp Collar was trialled by 139 patients in 10 sites across the UK and Ireland; 70.9% of participants choose to keep using the device after the trial \[R6, S2\]. Some feedback \[S2, R6\] from trial participants and their carers included: 

 Patients: 

-  *“Other, more rigid collars were painful – I couldn’t wear them for too long, I can wear this collar for 8 hours straight – I wear it at work”* 

-  *“I’ve tried the soft foam collars before but they don’t give enough support, they just crumbled”* 

-  *“Comfortable – more confident when out in public. Brilliant. Feels warm – like having a hot water bottle on your neck – helps muscles. Looks good” … “everyone who sees me in it says it looked brilliant – like a polo neck. Less self\-conscious now.”* 

 Carers: 

-  *""I can see his face better now""* 

-  *“Particularly useful when drinking as it enables him to flex his head to achieve an effective swallow""* 

 Researchers and a user  [<ins>describe the benefits of the</ins> <ins>HeadUp</ins> <ins>Collar</ins>](https://vimeo.com/272414469) design and the difference it makes to simple everyday acts, often taken for granted, such as having a meal out or reading a book \[S2, S3\]. Testimonials of patients describing the benefit of the HeadUp Collar on their lives have featured in the media \[S3a\-c\], including BBC \[S3\] and newspapers \[S3\]. A HeadUp Collar user  [<ins>said</ins>](https://vimeo.com/272414469) “ *It looks like clothing, really, rather than a medical device. Without the collar, I wouldn’t be able to drive and that makes a huge difference. With a rigid collar, you can look ahead but you can’t turn your head to see the traffic, but with this collar you can do that. It’s life\-changing really.”* The new collar has *""freed me up to have a much more normal life"". ""The quality of my life has been substantially different as a result of this collar, there's no doubt about that.”* \[S3\]. 

 Impact on clinician practitioners 

 The availability of the HeadUp Collar has changed clinical practice. All clinicians participating in the 100 Collar trial said they would like to have the collar in their range of products for patients, in a range of sizes \[R6, S2\]. They feel it could be useful for: 

-  *“any conditions with cervical weakness without shortness of breath”,* 

-  *“any conditions with neck weakness – for example Parkinson’s disease, brain injury and Muscular Dystrophy”, and “neck weakness developed as a complication following radiotherapy for breast cancer”* 

 The support of clinicians is backed up by the fact that the Collar has been directly purchased by 135 UK NHS Health Boards/Trusts \[S4\]. 

 International commercial impact 

 The global 'patent and know\-how' for the HeadUp Collar was licensed to UK SME, TalarMade, with the first commercial sale on 18 April 2018. As of 19 November 2020, in\-excess of 2,500 collars have been sold globally with a commercial value of sales £320,000 \[S4\]. 

 In the UK, the HeadUp Collar is available through all national and regional NHS Procurement Frameworks, and has been directly purchased by 135 UK NHS Health Boards/Trusts. Nineteen private UK Orthotic companies purchased over 300 units to service UK orthotic contracts. Full coverage of the UK in terms of areas purchased has been achieved \[S4\]. 

 The collar has been purchased across Europe, including all of Scandinavia \(up to 300 units so far\), Germany, Ireland, France, Spain, and the Netherlands. An EU Representative is now employed to negotiate licence deals with European distributors Basko \(Netherlands/Benelux\), OrthoEurope \(France\), and ProWalk \(Germany\) \[S4\]. 

 TalarMade recorded sales across North America \(independent buyers via ALS Society and ALS Society Quebec, 200\+ Units\) and a Reimbursement ‘L’ Code \(L0170\) has been awarded in the US. This code allows healthcare providers to invoice for the specific orthotics. Distribution has been secured with Hanger Clinic, the largest Rehab Clinical provider in the US with over 1800 Clinicians practising out of over 800 clinical facilities via their procurement arm SPS, Cascade Supply \(the largest independent Orthopaedic Supplier in the US\) and Becker Orthopaedic \[S4\]. 

 Further world\-wide sales have been achieved in Australia/New Zealand \(100\+ Units\) via partner OPC Health \[S4\]. 

 As a result of the HeadUp venture, Talarmade have secured a similar arrangement with Strathclyde University to develop a unique wrist orthosis \[S5\]. The commercial success of HeadUp has played a major part in allowing Talarmade to continue to progress on numerous fronts and has sustained the employment of Talarmade staff through during the COVID\-19 pandemic \[S4\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Brunel research has supported a paradigm shift from the provision of EPIOCs as simple mobility aids to tools that facilitate rehabilitation, independence and the participation of severely disabled individuals in society. It has informed public policy, provided resources for wheelchair users and purchasers and enhanced international clinical guidelines impacting 1,200,000 UK, 1,700,000 USA wheelchair users and an estimated 131,800,000 needing wheelchairs worldwide since 2014. These major impacts have improved EPIOC prescription for people growing up and growing old with enduring disability. As a result of this research effective policies have been developed, professional practice has been enhanced and more appropriate assessment and prescription is provided to EPIOC users. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor De Souza and clinical colleagues have a significant record of research into improving services for EPIOC users. This research, led by Prof De Souza, has influenced policy, practice and provision by emphasising that EPIOCs should be prescribed for rehabilitation and social participation purposes and not just as a mobility device. It emphasised that changing needs across the lifespan for those with complex and additional health conditions \(comorbidities\) must be considered alongside individuals’ primary diagnosis. The findings stressed that the impact of not meeting individuals’ needs causes life impoverishing complications, like scoliosis and contractures, which extend hospitalisation and treatments. 

 An estimated 131,500,000 people worldwide need wheelchairs. Services are challenged to achieve best practice and cost effectiveness that matches the current/future health condition of individuals, their requirements and preferences with chair and seating technologies that payers can support. Brunel research \(REF1\) uniquely demonstrated that provision of an EPIOC significantly improved users’ QoL as well as mobility, pain and discomfort. They adapted and developed the EuroQoL \(EQ5D\) to enable people with severe disabilities to report their QoL before and after EPIOC provision \(REF1\). Prior to this there was no existing measure available to determine QoL in that group. The study underlined that QoL was an essential health improvement facilitated by EPIOCs. 

 This research \(REF2\) explored the views of young people using EPIOCs demonstrating that young people with severe disabilities had similar needs and ambitions as their able\-bodied peers. They not only relied on an EPIOC for mobility, but importantly it impacted social inclusion, providing opportunities to build relationships with their peers and to facilitate overall development including enabling entry to the world of work. Users particularly valued the independence and privacy from parents that an EPIOC provided. Until these findings, EPIOCs had only been prescribed as a mobility aid; this research evidenced the equally important benefits derived from enhanced social inclusion through development opportunities afforded to children for whom EPIOCs may enhance independence and facilitate participation in family, school, and community life. 

 Evidencing the clinical therapeutic use of EPIOCs, Frank and DeSouza \(REF3\) examined pain experienced by users. They differentiated pain due to EPIOC inadequacies and pain due to underlying diagnoses and co\-morbidities, concluding that problematic pain required examination, and was manageable through medical interventions, or by enhanced use of EPIOC functions and seating. 

 DeSouza and Frank 2010 \(REF4\) DeSouza and Frank 2017 \(REF5\) and Frank and DeSouza 2016 \(REF6\) focussed on the therapeutic role of EPIOC for users with MS, rare diseases and CP across the age span highlighting issues relevant to ageing with these diagnoses, namely, mobility, pain, fatigue, and comorbidity, exploring deterioration due to diagnoses and inadequate long\-term management. Findings emphasised the occurrence of avoidable complications resulting from inadequate wheelchair provision which had consequences for provision with regard to type of chair and seating. These studies underlined the essential therapeutic role of EPIOCs and how provision is influenced by progressive neuromuscular impairments of the conditions, comorbidities and disorders related to long\-term disability. De Souza and colleagues recommended a holistic model of rehabilitation rather than a disease management orientated approach.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The situation for wheelchair users with complex and changing needs has been called “intolerable”, especially for children. Clinical provision and care has been enhanced as a result of impacts of this research on policy through evidence regarding the value of EPIOCs in enabling employment, education, social integration, health status and improved QoL allowing users to participate more fully in society, and enhancing personal comfort and lowering their risk of serious complications from EPIOC use. 

 Using this research \(REF1\), the NHS warned that wheelchairs poorly matched to users’ needs adversely affected activities, participation, lifestyle goals and health status, adding to cost and/or non\-use or abandonment of the wheelchair \(E1\). Brunel research outputs underpinned the case for growing support, internationally for providing EPIOCs to encourage social and community interaction. They emphasised that driving assessment including functional and cognitive abilities and education on safety were essential for EPIOC users; a recommendation from this research into young EPIOC users.  Brunel research \(REF1, REF2, REF4\) was used to underpin key targets for health service improvements and core service delivery standards for therapists who support people with disabilities, benefiting 1,200,000 potential chair users in the UK and an estimated 72,000 potential users in NSW Australia \(E2\). 

 **Impacts on practitioners and services internationally** 

 **Professional standards, guidelines and evidence\-based sources have been shaped by the research** 

 By transforming understanding of the importance of EPIOCs for children’s development and successful transition to independence in adulthood, this evidence has broadened assessment to include provision based on the social development needs of children and young adults, not just their mobility needs. Internationally, practitioners have improved evidence\-based guidelines and recommendations to enhance the quality of their professional practice. 

 This research has been used internationally to recommend that for children with inefficient mobility, EPIOCs enhance independence and facilitate participation in family, school, and community life. Direct use of study REF3 highlighted that to enhance EPIOC use without contributing to problematic posture and pain, supportive seating, powered seating functions and adequate suspension are important features to consider in prescription \(E3, E8\). Brunel research highlighted widespread debilitating suffering caused by pain \(E3\) and that EPIOC users related their pain to underlying medical conditions and to improperly configured wheelchairs. EPIOC users opined that wheelchair tilt functions can be used to manage pain/discomfort. This research informed influential position statements to support the application of seat functions to assist clinicians in decision\-making and justifying funding \(E4\). 

 Brunel research \(REF2\) underpinned advice on when children should start using power mobility. The evidence was used to recommend that early utilization of EPIOCs for children with mobility limitations enhances independence, improves development in multiple areas, and enables children to grow to become productive and integrated members of society \(E5, E8\). 

 Expert international consensus now endorses the therapeutic use of wheelchairs beyond mobility assistance. Using this research \(REF6\), international recommendations advocate short orthoses for daytime use to prevent ankle deformity and prolong gait ability and emphasise that correctly adapted wheelchairs can prevent skin ulcers and slow scoliosis progression thereby counteracting life\-threatening complications for children with muscular dystrophy \(E6\). Drawing directly on these findings \(REF2\) an international consensus group published clinical practice guidance for powered mobility in children of different ages, needs, and abilities. Recommendations based on these publications highlight the importance of EPIOCs in enhancing independence and facilitating participation in family, school and community life and that enhancing EPIOC use without contributing to problems of posture and pain, supportive seating, powered seating functions, and adequate suspension are essential features to consider in chair prescription \(E7\). 

 The research on children has been utilised by clinicians for the prescription of EPIOCs and to develop and provide hand\-outs for advanced training and safety for different types of child learners and to inform and support their parents \(E8\). One of these hand\-outs has recently been translated into Norwegian \(E9\) further illustrating the need internationally for evidence\-based information to support child EPIOC users and their parents/carers. 

 **Impacts on commercial companies** 

 Material provided by companies for chair prescribers, users, payers and other purchasers has been informed by this Brunel research and used as part of the justification for costs. The research \(REF5\) has provided evidence\-based information to prescribers and purchasers of wheelchairs, demonstrating that appropriate seating interventions, alongside competent assessment, can reduce pain and suffering, but at a financial cost which is justifiable by the enhanced wellbeing of chair users \(E9\). Brunel research \(REF4\) changed funding decisions in Canada from the provision of power tilt and recline chairs for pressure relief to the provision tilt\-in\-space features that give users the ability to autonomously control comfort, rest and pain reduction \(E10\). Brunel research has changed perceptions of the role of EPIOCS from mobility aids to enhancing the engagement of severely disabled adults and children in society. It has contributed to developing the market and international clinical guidelines impacting 1,200,000 UK, 1,700,000 USA wheelchair users and approximately 131,800,000 people needing wheelchairs worldwide.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Creating and Developing Coaches for Diversity \(CDC\) is a grassroots challenge to cultures of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic \(BAME\) exclusion in football. It has increased diversity in the coaching structures of football by creating networks and opportunities for BAME communities to join the coaching infrastructure. It has developed support mechanisms, showcasing role models and by helping communities to access qualifications and funding streams. CDC has worked with over 250 current and aspiring BAME football coaches across the country, by collaborating with the Football Association \(FA\), and the Zesh Rehman Foundation \(ZRF\), who implemented the CDC initiative into their Strategic Plan 2019\-22.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the last decade, Kilvington’s research has been concerned with participation and exclusion in football. While BAME and especially Black players are increasingly visible in the field of play \(constituting 30% of professional players\), they are largely excluded from the coaching and management structures of elite football \(there are only 6 Black managers across the 91 clubs of the English football league\). The situation for players and participants of Asian origin is even more stark. There are only 12 British Asian professional footballers in England out of approximately 3,700 players, and only 2 senior level football coaches out of 522, despite the fact that football is the number one sport among British Asian communities. 

 Up to 2016, Kilvington’s research had focused on identifying the fundamental barriers that systemically and culturally exclude BAME players at all levels of the game. These include: a lack of opportunities; racism; and a lack of role models. As an impact researcher, he offered recommendations for reform, based on 75 oral testimonies with key figures, in the concluding chapter of his 2016 monograph **\(3.1\).** These reform strategies were further emphasised and developed in a 2017 journal article in *Soccer & Society* \( **3.2\),** which argued that increasing diversity in off\-field roles, and particularly among coaches, is fundamental to the achievement of greater diversity and positive cultural change within football. 

 CDC was formed in response to these findings as coaches were identified as key figures to alleviate said socio\-cultural barriers. But, the barriers to coach inclusion had to be empirically understood and Kilvington therefore conducted research with BAME football coaches to identify the barriers to socio\-cultural inclusion and uncover what actions could be undertaken \( **3.3, 3.4, 3.5\)**. The barriers include: institutionalised practices of racism which exclude BAME coaches; racialised and cultural stereotypes concerning the perceived inability of BAME coaches; a lack of contacts and networks with key stakeholders such as the FA or professional clubs; and a lack of role models. 

 Kilvington’s research advocates that in order to increase BAME participation on the field, particularly among British Asian communities, we must create and develop opportunities for football coaches as they provide opportunities for players. Coaches become role models; they provide a space for community, bonding, and for socio\-cultural belonging; and they promote healthy lifestyles. In addition, by diversifying coaches at elite levels, ‘white\-to\-white’ scouting networks will be destabilised, and coaches and scouts’ racialised and cultural stereotypes regarding players will be challenged. 

 In sum, CDC challenges inequality and increases diversity both on and off the field. Based on empirical data, CDC offers BAME communities an opportunity to meet, and network with, key and influential stakeholders within football who are provide support and highlight funding and mentoring opportunities.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 CDC’s impacts include: building racially diverse networks; providing support mechanisms; highlighting opportunities; equipping participants with qualifications; highlighting funding; showcasing role models; influencing policy change. 

 8 CDC events took place in Bradford, Leeds, Huddersfield, Burnley, Manchester and West Ham football stadiums and county FAs.  CDC invited 250 current and aspiring football coaches from under\-represented backgrounds to network with key stakeholders including the FA, Kick It Out and coaching organisations. Keynote speakers provide inspiring talks and acted as role models for aspiring coaches. Thanks to CDC new BAME personnel are: working full\-time within football; delivering quality coaching sessions for young footballers; officially linked within FA channels of communication; and are recipients of funding. For some participants, CDC has been life changing. This is on\-going work: future events are planned in partnership with ZRF. 

 *Networks* 

 Kilvington demonstrates that white networks exclude BAME people from football.  By facilitating networking with key stakeholders, CDC challenged this exclusion **5.1; 5.3**\).  As Ahmed Elotaibi comments, CDC helped to “develop networks we might not ever get a chance to \[access\]” \( **5.1, p.1**\). Asad Qureshi used his experience and contacts to help launch a charity, and also helped Zaheer, a British Asian football coach, gain employment at a professional club \( **5.2, p.3**\). Kevin Coleman, FA Diversity & Inclusion manager, reflects on how he supported Shadab and Nas, who have since progressed further in football following a CDC event \( **5.5**\). 

 Building networks also benefited stakeholders \( **5.2, p.3**\). Qureshi discusses the collaborative projects he’s created. For example, the FA are now collaborating with Liverpool FC on an Asian inclusion project, thanks to CDC \( **5**. **5, p.1**\). Networks have flourished since the CDC events and further projects have been established. 

 *Support and Opportunity* 

 Before attending a CDC event, Qureshi reports: “I was at a crossroads in my life \[… I\] had been rejected countless times for jobs in football” \( **5.7, p.1**\). At the event, he met Steve Dorey from West Riding FA, who helped him with his successful application for Football Development Office at Sheffield FA. The network generated crucial support, enabling him to gain his position with the FA \(Qureshi is the only BAME member of staff in a county with 16% BAME population\). 

 Coleman, through his role at the FA, has offered considerable support to participants. He has promoted and collaborated on inclusion events organized by the Muslim Council of Britain who were present at the West Ham CDC \( **5.5, p.2**\). 

 CDC provided opportunities for coaches to gain experience in non\-threatening environments. Asad Qureshi offered participants shadowing opportunities at his club because some BAME coaches were uncomfortable delivering sessions in predominantly white spaces \( **5.2, p.2**\). Some stakeholders also benefited from CDC by gaining full\-time work in football. Asad Qureshi credits CDC for securing his role at West Riding FA while Tahir Akram thanks “CDC for helping change \[his\] life” \( **5**. **7, p.2**\). Steve Smithies \( **5**. **6**\) and Kevin \( **5.5**\) also provide multiple examples of how they have used their roles to help CDC participants to progress. 

 *Qualifications* 

 A major impact of CDC has been the completion of FA and UEFA qualification badges. 25 participants gain football qualifications. Four participants have since completed the UEFA B badge. Four participants from Phoenix Juniors, a predominantly British Asian club, have undertaken their FA Level 1 and 2 badges which “has huge benefits for the community and the kids they’re working with” \( **5**. **6, p.2**\).  CDC recognised the economic barriers to qualification and secured a reduced price for the FA Level 1 qualification. This meant several amateur St. Pauli FC coaches could attend, one of whom was an asylum seeker, for whom the qualification was key to his successful right to remain. He now works as a personal trainer, “partially \[due\] to his qualification as an FA coach” \( **5.4, p.2**\). 

 *Funding* 

 CDC has helped marginalized communities to access funding streams. For instance Coleman has helped one participant win funding \( **5.5, p.1**\). 

 *Role Models* 

 Role models play a key role in providing belief for marginalized groups. The survey responses emphasized the importance of role models as they helped “open eyes”, “encourage belief”, and provide “confidence” \( **5.3**\). One respondent recalls the profound effect of seeing role models, noting that “believing it’s possible wouldn’t have happened without your event” \( **5.2, pp.1\-2**\). Including a successful BAME keynote at each event provided the spark for success. 

 *Influence* 

 CDC, as an inclusion strategy, has been used to inform FA policy and practice \( **5.2, p.2**\). CDC is also an official inclusionary strategy of ZRF and will continue to impact on the lives of BAME football coaches from across the country \( **5.8; 5.9**\). 

 “I will forever be indebted to Dan Kilvington, Steve Dorey and CDC for helping change my life and allowing me to work in football \[…\] initiatives such as CDC are a huge positive for the BAME community” \( **5.6, p.2**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Businesses led by members of minority ethnic communities contributed £25bn to the UK economy in 2013. Yet these and other minority businesses face major inequalities, including difficulties in accessing finance, and minority communities remain under\-represented in businesses. The Enterprise and Diversity Alliance \(EDA\) at the University of Birmingham has **shaped the way key financial Institutions, sector associations and others work with and support Ethnic Minority Businesses \(EMB\) in the UK and beyond**. This has been achieved through improved business support, mentoring provision, financial support and training around diversity. The EDA has helped develop an ‘Inclusive Leadership Pledge’ which promotes diversity more broadly in businesses and organisations in the West Midlands. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The EDA was run from Birmingham Business School between 2013 and 2020 by Professor Kiran Trehan and Professor Monder Ram, with the aim of making a tangible difference for EMBs — enterprises owned and managed by ethnic minorities. EDA applied an action\-research approach linking the work of academics, policy makers, institutions and practitioners in order to understand what works in addressing local, national and global issues of diversity in businesses Its work analysed enterprise diversity both in the context of ethnic minorities and women in business, focusing on issues such as relative access to finance, market selection and management skills. Traditionally literatures on ethnic enterprise and women in business have represented separate fields of enquiry, but the work of EDA has explicitly sought to bring these literatures together not only to explore how business ownership is experienced by different social groups, but also to explore the consequences of separating these groups into different categories, one of which is arguably to represent minority subjects as being ‘in deficit’ to a mythologised norm \(R1\). 

 The research of the EDA ranged in practice from surveys led by Ram of minority businesses \(R2\) to more detailed qualitative case study work led by Trehan with specific minority enterprises \(R3\), but both were linked to wider and active engagement with minority ethnic enterprises in the form of training, workshops and public engagement. Together, these different strands of research and engagement sought to understand the potential for and constraints faced by minority businesses from their own perspective, to tease out narratives both of structural constraints, but also of opportunities and advantages, adopting a ‘mixed embeddedness’ approach. The research of the EDA challenges ‘boosterism’ around minority business, as well as normative assumptions that entrepreneurship more generally is associated with economic growth, wealth creation and prosperity. Against a backdrop of structural and economic discrimination, minority entrepreneurs often find that entrepreneurship offers an inherently precarious living \(R4\). 

 A specific offshoot of this wider action\-research initiative has included the investigation of leadership diversity in corporate organisations via work with the West Midlands Combined Authority \(WMCA\) and the West Midlands Mayor \(R5\). In particular, the WMCA established a ‘Leadership Commission’ in 2018 and commissioned Trehan to undertake a nine\-month research programme that culminated in her authorship of its final report, *Leaders Like You*. Although diversity has potential to enhance performance, and refine and develop markets and services, organisations often lack practical guidance about how to achieve this. One of the themes that links the EDA’s work in small businesses and large organisations is the critical importance of mentoring of all kinds — including peer\-to\-peer and reverse mentoring — in helping to shift major structural barriers to the advancement of minorities and diversity. 

 **Key Findings** 

 **KF1.** Small Businesses face many barriers to accessing money, markets and support for developing management skills. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the case of EMBs. EMBs are often isolated and excluded from important networks — like banks, mentors and gatekeepers to large organisations. This relegates their businesses to the margins, often operating outside the mainstream economy \(R1, R2, R4\). 

 **KF2.** Relationships with gatekeeper institutions, notably, the banking and credit provision industry, are one of the major constraints on the development of minority enterprise \(R1, R3\). 

 **KF3.** Perceptions of prejudice prevent ethnic minority communities from starting and growing enterprises, depriving them of associated social and economic benefits. Tackling these perceptions enables productive relationships between banks and minority businesses \(R1, R2, R3\). 

 **KF4.** More supportive diversity policies and mainstreaming of diversity proofing in sector\-leading institutions are necessary to achieve economic and social inclusion of ethnic minorities and their access to leadership roles \(R1, R5, R6\). 

 **KF5.** Business mentoring is critical to the survival and growth of EMBs and for the development of ethnic minorities working within finance sector roles. <ins>Peer\-to\-peer mentoring is effective for capacity\-building for EMBs, as is mentoring between large and small firms \(R1\).</ins> 

 **KF6.** Mentoring opportunities and their benefits need to be communicated better to EMBs and ethnic minorities. Existing mentoring programmes need to allow sufficient time to build the necessary trust between mentor and mentee, which is especially significant in cases of EMBs who have low levels of confidence. These steps will help to overcome the current paucity of mentors and role models which acts as a barrier to both EMBs and ethnic minorities employed in businesses \(R1, R5\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The work of the Enterprise and Diversity Alliance \(EDA\) has changed how large banking institutions, sector associations, and other employers and organisations support Ethnic Minority Businesses \(EMB\) at regional, national and international levels. Specifically the EDA has shaped: 

1.  <ins> **Changes to business support, including finance, mentoring and advice for EMBs provided by key UK banks**</ins> 

 Two large financial organisations, **NatWest Bank and Lloyds Banking Group \(LBG\) have transformed their mentoring provision and finance support for EMBs across the UK**: 

 **1.a.** NatWest has improved its business support mechanisms for EMBs through mentoring and better support provision. NatWest trialled an ‘Accelerator’ programme in London in 2018–2019, which has been rolled out nationally, with bases in Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, Leeds and Glasgow; and an ‘Expert in Residence programme’ was piloted in the West Midlands in 2018 and made national in 2019, involving partnership with all 38 Local Enterprise Partnership Growth Hubs \(S1\). Both programmes build trust between EMBs and the financial sector through access to financial guidance, bank advisers and mentors in local communities and nationally \(KF2, KF3, KF6, S1\). Accelerators have provided support to 250 EMBs to date \(S1\). The ‘Expert in Residence programme’ is a peer\-mentoring scheme which facilitates the sharing of local expertise by a local ‘expert’ to grow EMBs and female\-run businesses, improve diversity and inclusion in business \(S1\). The Strategic Lead for Diversity in Business at NatWest confirms “\[EDA’s\] research has been critical in informing and shaping our approach, policies and practices to diversity”, and as a result they report improved customer experience and “stronger relationships” with EMBs \(S1\). In the West Midlands alone 25 mentoring workshops for EMBs and Bank staff, designed to “change the perception challenges as highlighted by the \(EDA’s\) research”, resulted in “stronger relationships with over 100 minority businesses” \(S1\). 

 **1.b.** Between 2014\-2019, LBG has redesigned and expanded its in house business support for EMBs and introduced staff training and mentoring \(S2, KF1, KF2, KF4\). They have prioritised mentoring for EMBs seen as “most marginalised by traditional forms of business support” \(S2\) through a new bespoke scheme, which has **resulted in entrepreneurs who have taken part in LBG Financial mentoring schemes seeing up to a 40% increase in new business** as a result of greater financial capacity due to these improved relationships \(S3\). They developed new unconscious bias training which is now mandatory for all 2,000 LBG commercial staff nationally \(S1\). This includes cultural awareness and sensitivity training, considering languages and formats and raising awareness of EMB anxieties \(KF2, KF3\). The bank has also delivered new unconscious bias training to an additional 600 staff and supported 500 LGB Charity mentors and 500 LBG Social Enterprise mentors to diversity proof their practices in line with Trehan’s recommendations \(S2\). LBG UK Head of Manufacturing SME and Mid Corporate stated, “as a consequence of Professor Trehan’s research we developed all our mentor training with an additional focus on listening skills” \(S2\). The bank has also changed how it engages with EMBs with the new processes resulting from ten “interactive events \[which\] allowed open dialogue and questions for the first time in a relaxed event setting between diversity entrepreneurs and bankers” held between 2014\-18. These allowed the bank to “…build key relationships with leading diversity entrepreneurs. This support resulted in increased levels of trust and understanding between the banking teams and the entrepreneurs and removed barriers to accessing support” \(S2\). 

1.  <ins> **Mentoring support provided to EMB clients by major sector organisations and companies across the UK and Europe**</ins> 

 <ins>Organisations across the UK and Europe, including the</ins> <ins> **British Banking Association**</ins> <ins>\(BBA\), the</ins> <ins> **National Enterprise Network**</ins> <ins>\(NEN\), the</ins> <ins> **Institute of Enterprise and Entrepreneurs**</ins> <ins>\(IOEE\) and the</ins> <ins> **Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development**</ins> <ins>\(OECD\), as well as companies such as</ins> <ins> **Leapfrog Mountain**</ins> <ins>have changed their mentoring provision and/or strategy around mentoring in the following ways:</ins> 

 <ins> **2a.**</ins> <ins>Between 2015–2019,</ins> the <ins>BBA</ins><ins>, a leading trade association with 200 member banks and operations in 180 jurisdictions worldwide, has transformed the way its member banks engage with and support their EMB clients by expanding and redefining their mentoring provision \(S4\). Following Trehan and Ram’s recommendations</ins> <ins>\(KF1, KF5\)</ins><ins>, the BBA has</ins> implemented three different mentoring schemes: **peer\-to\-peer mentoring for EMBs** through the 12–8 Group; **large corporate mentorship of SME EMBs** and the **BBA Mentorsme mentoring scheme** to reach grassroots businesses that banks find difficult to access \(S4\). Key policies identified as barriers to EMBs were changed, <ins>such as implementing a feedback mechanism to clients whose loan requests were rejected, setting up an appeals procedure and introducing a credit scoring guide to provide better guidance on how they might secure loans in the future \(KF1, KF5; R1, R5\). The</ins> <ins>BBA states that</ins> <ins> **over 100 EMB businesses have taken up mentoring as a result of joint initiatives with the EDA**</ins> <ins>over two years and that it has introduced a ‘diversity’ category into its Excellence in Enterprise Mentorsme</ins> <ins>Awards directly as a result of its work on EDA. Trehan and Ram’s guidance on diversity proofing was implemented for example through the BBA’s</ins> <ins>Mentorsme</ins> <ins>portal, which is currently used by</ins> <ins> **120 mentoring organisations, which have around 27,000 enterprise mentors**</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins> </ins><ins>According to the Head of the BBA: “</ins>Our collaboration with EDA and Professor Trehan of the University of Birmingham informed insights which led to important changes in our strategy for diversity and mentoring practices. We used the research best practice and recommendations to form our new strategy and this was shared with banks mentoring task force resulting in bank wide changes to policy direction and practical implementation of mentoring policy” \(S4\). 

 **2.b.** The NEN has **improved its mentoring provision and developed a business case to ensure mentoring remains a key support mechanism for EMBs across their membership despite funding cuts**. NEN has 30,000 enterprise clients a year, of which 20% are EMBs \(S5\). The CEO of NEN reports “in 2014 Government funding was reduced to social enterprises and/or focused on business advisors instead of mentoring \[…\] The EDA’s work, and Trehan’s research, helped us to justify a continued commitment to mentoring. By sharing their research \[...\] mentoring remained a key support route for our member organisations \[…\] Many of the Enterprise Agencies the NEN work with had created small mentoring projects previously however, they had found it costly and time consuming. Because of Prof Trehan and teams \[ *sic*\] work and guidance, they were able to implement mentoring schemes with greater ease and to follow best practice to support 60% of our EMB Ethnic Minority Businesses” \(S5; KF2\). 

 <ins> **2.c.**</ins> <ins>Between 2016–18,</ins> <ins>the IOEE</ins> <ins> </ins><ins>changed its policies and practices influencing the work of their 150 referral organisations across the UK \(S6\). Specifically, they introduced</ins> <ins> **new mentoring guidelines and processes that take account of diversity and inclusion for the first time**</ins><ins>, including inclusive marketing and staff diversity</ins> <ins> </ins><ins>\(KF3, KF5\).</ins> The IOEE “used \[Trehan’s\] research to inform significant change to our approval process for new centres and academies. This means all organisations now applying to be an accredited learning academy with us must evidence their diversity offering, policy and commitment” \(S6; KF4\). <ins>IOEE mentoring guidelines also influenced</ins> <ins> **a nation\-wide audience of**</ins> <ins> **30,000 IOEE members**</ins> <ins>through the Institute’s on\-line member\-to\-member offer \(S6\).</ins> The CEO states: <ins>“</ins>The research published by Professor Trehan at the University of Birmingham examining the impact of mentoring within diverse ethnicity backgrounds has informed current IOEE policy and practice, as well as future proofing of processes so they are inclusive of the needs of different groups of individuals looking to start or grow their business. Because of this a greater number \[of\] **over 130 businesses have been able to access quality mentoring support** where historically this may not have been the case” \(S6\). 

 <ins> **2.d.**</ins> <ins>Between 2016 to 2018, EDA recommendations</ins> <ins> **were instrumental in the design and delivery of Leapfrog Mountain’s diversity practices and mentoring provision**</ins><ins>. Leapfrog Mountain provides bespoke mentoring and leadership programmes to major clients across the UK, including Pearson, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce and the Royal Institute of Architects. Their CEO states:</ins> “as a direct consequence of Trehan’s research we created our diversity policy, our Mentoring programme design and our Mentor engagement based on her insights and best practices. This has led to best practices being shared and used across a wealth of organisations that we support” \(S7; KF5, KF6\). <ins>This includes \(1\) new mentor training and a qualifications programme to support</ins> <ins> **1,000 volunteer mentors for the Scottish Chambers of Commerce**</ins><ins>; \(2\) a new mentoring programme, website and training for</ins> <ins> **50 key staff at the Royal Institute of British Architects \(which has 44,000 members\)**</ins> <ins>and \(3\) a new on\-line training programme for mentors supporting newly qualified teaching staff for the</ins> <ins> **Society for Education and Training \(the largest membership body in the education sector, with over 20,000 members\)**</ins><ins>. Trehan’s research has “shaped key concepts” of a toolkit used by UK corporates in setting up Corporate Social Responsibility mentoring programmes with Leapfrog and the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills \(S7\).</ins> 

 **2.e.** The EDA’s approach shaped practice at the OECD so **informing European Policy and Practice**, which cites the EDA work as an exemplar in its guidance on *Inclusive Entrepreneurship* \(S8\). The OECD mentoring toolkit for EMBs draws on Trehan’s findings and is being disseminated to all the OECD EMB clients across Europe \(S8; KF5, KF6\). EDA was one of 22 selected case studies from across the EU and beyond \(including Canada and Australia\) and scored highly from a sample of 193 effective schemes, and was one of only two from the UK \(S8\). Further, the EDA’s work has been reviewed and showcased in a European Commission report which “\[d\]isseminate\[s\] lessons learned from these successful initatives in Europe and beyond and to encourage replication of good practices” to support migrant entrepreneurship. 

 **3.**  <ins> **The West Midlands ‘Inclusive Leadership Pledge’**</ins> 

 The West Midlands ‘Inclusive Leadership Pledge’ \(S9\), was launched following the Leadership Commission, a nine\-month collaborative process considering leadership diversity in the region led by the West Midlands Combined Authority \(WMCA\), which culminated with a final report *Leaders Like You*, authored by Trehan \(S9\). The Commission was commended by PM Theresa May as an exemplar for improving equality \(S9\). According to the Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street: “Trehan’s recommendations as presented in *Leaders Like You* went on to inform and shape the launch of the WMCA Leadership Forum in January 2019 and the Leadership Pledge \[…\] key instruments for building inclusive leadership, which better represents the region’s diversity” \(S9\). 

 WMCA has committed to implementing key recommendations of the *Leaders Like You* report across a diverse range of organisations including large businesses, small firms, public and professional services. Organisations that have signed up to the Pledge to date include major firms such as KPMG, Wesleyan \(S10\) and DLA Piper, Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club and public sector bodies including the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, Black Country Growth Hub, the Coventry and Warwickshire LEP, and regional universities, including the University of Birmingham itself. To aid implementation of the Pledge, WMCA has produced a Toolkit for Inclusive Leadership \(S10\) which includes five ‘What Works’ guides that draw directly on Trehan’s report. The Pledge LinkedIn page has over 2,700 followers \(S10\). Following one recommendation, the ‘Mayor’s Mentoring Scheme’ has been expanded to reach 10,000 disadvantaged young people in the region by mid\-2020, many from minority backgrounds. UoB staff are mentors in this scheme and, with two other regional universities, have created the *Transformation West Midlands* project providing coaching, mentoring and reverse mentoring opportunities for students from minority ethnic backgrounds \(S9\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Virtual reality \(VR\) is a ground\-breaking technology in principle, but in practice most of its applications have been inspired by established cinematic and gaming forms. Goldsmiths' Computing Department has provided the milieu for a cross\-disciplinary collaboration which brings together visual art, software engineering and scientific modelling to create a suite of highly original VR experiences with deep and diverse social and scientific impacts. 

 William Latham and Frederic Fol Leymarie’s Mutator platform enables users to immerse themselves in experientially rich virtual landscapes, based on rigorous mathematical modelling of biological systems. This has led to the creation of a family of pioneering VR experiences that are evocative \(as art\), illuminating \(as scientific visualisations\), educational \(as models of biological processes\) and entertaining \(as immersive games\). 

 These have secured deep engagement with international cultural audiences, found significant real\-world applications in science and more recently attracted significant commercial interest. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 William Latham pioneered the use of evolutionary algorithms – those that mimic biological processes – in computer graphics at IBM's UK Scientific Centre in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The products of the FormGrow system were appreciated both as art \(exhibited in galleries\) and in popular culture \(via the ""rave"" scene\) but rooted in rigorous mathematical modelling by the biologist William Hamilton and software engineering by computer scientist Stephen Todd. Frederic Leymarie founded Goldsmiths' pioneering MA in Computational Arts and in 2005 invited Latham to present his work. That began a process of increasing engagement and collaboration which culminated in Latham becoming a professor at Goldsmiths in 2007. 

 **Computer art:** The initial focus was to reimplement, update and expand FormGrow, the result being the Mutator modelling and visualisation platform. Mutator has been used to create a range  of experiences with diverse applications, but which all allow their users to generate and explore limitless new worlds. **\[R1\]** These environments, and their simulated inhabitants, react and develop according to accurate biological principles. **\[R2**\] The initial screen\-based presentation was implemented as a series of immersive virtual reality environments from 2016 onwards.

| --- | --- |
| **Visualisation:** Because the system renders millions of points of scientific data into a custom model, controlled by a novel but carefully designed user interface using standard VR hardware, it became apparent that the platform could also support scientific visualisations if applied to actual biological systems. Latham and Leymarie, working with collaborators at Imperial College, Oxford University and the University of York, developed systems – FoldSynth and CSynth **\[R3,R4\]** – which give both laypeople and researchers an intuitive way to explore and understand the structure, composition and function of biological molecules, including DNA, proteins and entire viruses such as SARS\-COV\-2.  **Outreach:** The visualisation work found substantial application in public outreach, which became the focus of a subsequent project with Imperial College. Between 2013 and 2017, the partners developed BioBlox an educational game allowing laypeople to explore how proteins “dock” with each other, as well as 3D graphical tools for scientists. **\[R5\]**  This work was funded by a four\-year, £1m BBSRC grant and is now being expanded to illustrate the molecular mechanisms used by Covid\-19.  The common strand through each of these four areas of development is the combination of intensive data modelling, a novel interface and gamification, applied to both real and simulated biological systems. There is also a shared emphasis on cross\-disciplinary collaboration, rapid prototyping and development through iteration – a combination uniquely facilitated by the culture and objectives of Goldsmiths' Computing Department. **\[R6\]** Typically Latham works with collaborators to identify realisable areas of mutual interest; Leymarie supplies the mathematical modelling and Todd the software engineering needed to implement it. Releases are driven by outreach at public events, which allows feedback to be gathered and acted upon quickly, as well as attracting further collaborators. |

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **1: Large and diverse audiences for a new form of art** 



 *Image: Mutator VR Vortex exhibited at the Kinninji Buddhist Temple in Kyoto, March 2019* 

 Mutator VR allows users to create and explore virtual landscapes that are procedurally generated from mathematical rules and inhabited by organisms which obey biological principles. Each experience is unique as users explore endless worlds, unseen and unheard until called into existence. There are now several variants – Vortex, FormScape and Tadpoles – which explore different permutations of interaction with the environments and their occupants. **\[S1\]** 

 These new artefacts have been continuously exhibited at major international cultural venues. For example, during 2019/20 they were featured in public exhibitions at such globally renowned institutions as The Lowry in Manchester; the Pompidou Centre in Paris; the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, the Modern Art Museum in Shanghai. They have also appeared in numerous less formal locations, ranging from the Shoom 30 rave to the New Scientist Live science festival and the Kennin\-iji Buddhist Temple in Kyoto. **\[S2\]** 

 This has exposed the work to a far larger and more diverse audience than is typical for computer art. For example, at New Scientist Live, 2,300 people experienced MutatorVR for themselves, while its presence as an ""anchor"" exhibit with large\-scale projection meant it would have been apparent to all 25,000 visitors to the event. This is all the more impressive given the challenges of mounting such exhibits. 

 ""Taking VR artworks in exhibitions like the public realm festival Lightwaves 2018 and gallery exhibition The State of US \[at The Lowry, Manchester\] both have challenges. They both produce a high footfall of public engagement and the artworks have to adapt to high levels of audience interaction whilst also producing a rich artistic interaction for the public,"" says Lucy Dusgate, the producer at The Lowry responsible for Mutator's appearance in both these shows. ""Working closely with Professor Latham enabled us to jointly develop and adapt the artwork to address these key issues … We were particularly impressed and received public feedback that the artwork was engaging for all ages, social demographics and produced an accessible and seamless high\-quality experience for audiences. It effortlessly created a learning environment that captivated curiosity and encouraged broad participation in the learning."" **\[S3\]** 

 This appeal has proven to be globally applicable, even in cultures that might not be considered receptive to VR art. ""Asians prefer expression of the world so that it looks like nature in our real world rather than a pure virtual world. Therefore, it is a big challenge for \[Latham\] and me to exhibit the Mutator VR in Japan,""  writes Naoko Tosa of Kyoto University. Nonetheless, it was shown at Kyoto's oldest Zen temple, where ""interestingly and fortunately against our worry, most of the visitors … appreciated the exhibition. This means the worldview expressed by the Mutator VR is global and could be understood and shared by people over the world."" **\[S3\]** 

 **2. Illuminating visualisations help scientists share their research**

| *Image: MVR CSynth Virus Viewer displaying the Herpes Simplex Virus in VR* |

 Molecular biology deals in microscopic entities – proteins, genes, viruses – whose structures are enormously complicated and whose behaviour is radically unintuitive. It thus presents a challenging communication problem, despite its fundamental importance and applications in healthcare. 

 ""A significant outcome of this work meant we developed several high\-profile public engagement experiences with CSynth at the core. This work was initially funded by a Wellcome Trust Public Engagement award and called “DNA Origami: How do you fold a genome?” and resulted in worldwide coverage and exposure of our research to thousands of members of the public,"" says Stephen Taylor, Head of the Computational Biology Research Group at the MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford. 

 Visualisations of protein docking and of viral structures have been shown to the general public at high\-profile outreach events including New Scientist Live, the Imperial Spark Festival, the Royal Society Summer Exhibition, the Cheltenham Science Festival and at the Crick Institute to inform public understanding of scientific research. Inclusion in these events is highly competitive and selected work must be scientifically rigorous while also accessible to the public. **\[S4\]** 

 ""The Virus VR set up to illustrate our latest research in the modelling of viruses based on our paper “Structural puzzles in virology solved with an overarching icosahedral design principle” on virus tilings in the journal Nature Communications in 2019 … has been very well received by the general public and has changed their perception of the importance of Mathematics in Virology as the feedback forms demonstrate,"" writes Professor Reidun Twarock of the University of York, including comments such as “A clear visual look at mathematical structures in biology” and “I didn’t know how important mathematics were in understanding viruses before I used the VR”. 

 ""Such outreach projects that are designed to change perceptions on the impact of mathematical research in virology are even more important at present in view of the current Covid\-19 pandemic, as they illustrate the contributions academia is making to the health sector, and highlight the solutions that science has to offer to society."" **\[S5\]** 

 **3\) Educational games inform young people’s understanding of how viruses work** 

 Bioblox is a free mobile game for young people, ages 11\-18, which demonstrates how proteins dock. Users drag, rotate and swipe to move protein shaped ‘jigsaw pieces’ around the screen in a manner akin to Tetris. This is an important problem in molecular biology and understanding it is key to developments in medicine and public health, as testified to by the £1m in funding granted to the project by the BBSRC. **\[S6\]** 

 
This topical game has been endorsed by games industry bodies Ukie and TIGA. The latter's CEO, Richard Wilson noted: ""It is timely to see Goldsmiths and Imperial Researchers using games technology to promote understanding of the corona virus, medical science and social distancing in a very novel way"". **\[S7\]** The game was rated the second\-best educational app for Android by Science Focus magazine in September 2020. 

 The collaboration's public\-facing, iterative approach to research and development has led to continuing collaborations with an increasingly diverse set of partners. For example: 

-  Showing the work in Shanghai led to a Visiting Professorship for William Latham at Jiao Tong University and the commissioning of a major ""Master Studio"" retrospective exhibition and lecture series, funded by JTU, to be delivered in 2020/21. **\[S8\]** 

-  Exhibiting MutatorVR led to discussions with the R&D division of hardware manufacturer HTC Vive. This has in turn led to a memorandum of understanding with the University of Maryland to investigate if MutatorVR can be used in pain relief for medical patients. **\[S9\]** 

-  Work done on virus modelling with partners at the University of York under a Wellcome Trust award is now underway to turn genetic information into musical notes. The objective is to create an instrument that will simultaneously play music and simulate genetic mutation, illustrating this important concept in an accessible way. **\[S10\]** 

-  Adding generative audio to the MutatorVR set\-up has created a compelling but highly intuitive creative platform combining sight, sound and movement. This has attracted substantial interest from major music labels and games companies and is being prepared for spin\-out as a standalone commercial company.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Evaluations of sporting and cultural events historically focused on economic consequences. Interdisciplinary research in economics, geography and environmental planning at Cardiff led to the adoption of an event impact evaluation methodology, which identifies linkages between economic and environmental impacts. The research transformed how policymakers, event organisers and consultants understand and evaluate event environmental impacts. It underpinned the environmental section of the ‘eventIMPACTS’ toolkit from UK Sport \(the UK’s high\-performance sports agency\), the widespread adoption of which led to the staging of more sustainable events in five continents. It also influenced the development and scope of the first International Sustainability Standard for Golf Tournaments, which certified major tournaments in the US, Italy, and China. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Business cases for hosting major sporting and cultural events, which often rely upon public funding, traditionally focused on economic consequences but neglected to consider that such events can also have adverse environmental impacts. An interdisciplinary team from Cardiff’s Schools of Business \(specifically the Welsh Economy Research Unit\) and Geography and Planning analysed the environmental consequences of tourism consumption at major events. The research team’s interdisciplinary focus allowed the integration of economic approaches in analysing event\-related consumption spending with methods used in geography and environmental planning to assess the environmental consequences of this spending. 

 This highlighted the importance of assessing linkages between the economic and environmental consequences of event development and resulting visitor impact in event business management and planning. This work was supported through funding from ESRC and AHRC programmes, including the ESRC Centre for Business Relationships, Accountability and Sustainability and Society, and significant funding from the Environment for Growth \(E4G\) consortium of public sources in Wales **\[3.1, G3.1, G3.2\]**. 

 **2.1 Combining environmental and economic assessments to evaluate sporting events** 

 There has historically been a shortage of assessment tools \(and benchmark evidence\) to evaluate the environmental impact of events. In response, the Cardiff research team integrated methods from economics with methods from geography and planning to assess both the environmental and economic impacts of events **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]**. One of the two existing methodologies assessed was ENVIO \(Environmental extended Input Output Analysis\), traditionally used for examining the economic consequences of events, but more recently expanded to take account of environmental effects linked to event consumption. Research team members from the Business School contributed their expertise in using input\-output tables as part of ENVIO, as a different means of exploring the environmental consequences of events. The second methodology assessed was EF \(Ecological Footprint\), used to assess resource use and measure its global environmental impact. 

 In 2004, the Cardiff team was the first to use both methodologies in combination to evaluate a major sporting event \(FA Cup Final at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium\) **\[3.2\]**. They further examined the appropriateness of applying ENVIO and EF to other major sporting events \(e.g. Tour de France Grande Départ in London, 2007\) **\[3.3\]**. This demonstrated that both methods could be used in combination and employed similar data sets which could also inform an economic assessment **\[3.4\]**. This research: 

-  showed that direct and indirect environmental emissions could be estimated through the assessment of tourism spending linked to events **\[3.1, 3.2\]**; 

-  identified the types of visitor spending which generated the most significant environmental impacts, particularly the significance of event\-related travel and food and drink consumption **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]**; 

-  highlighted how changes to travel behaviour \(e.g. reducing air and car travel\) could significantly reduce the environmental impacts of events **\[3.3\]**. 

 The researchers recommended that this combined approach should be used in event impact evaluation as standard as it enables event organisers, policy makers and consultants to consider environmental impacts alongside economic impacts **\[3.2, 3.4\]**. 

 **2.2 Validating the new method for large scale events** 

 The research team further assessed and compared the economic and environmental impacts of major sporting events, including the FA Cup Final \(Cardiff, 2004\), a Six Nations rugby fixture \(Cardiff, 2006\) and the Tour de France Grand Départ \(London, 2007\), as well as cultural events, such as the Hay Literature Festival \(Wales, 2012\). The research: 

-  identified specific resource demands and policy amenable drivers that influence the scale of event environmental impacts. This includes visitor numbers, spending/consumption patterns, travel distance and mode, length of stay and event duration **\[3.4\]**; 

-  found that visitor profiles and spending patterns differed across events, resulting in varying economic and environmental impacts and a different composition of impacts **\[3.4, 3.5\]**; 

-  noted that tourism spending in a regional economy, including from visitors to sporting and cultural events, can impact on the carbon footprint and waste **\[3.6\]**; 

-  highlighted the need for future *ex ante* studies predicting event impacts to recognise the impact that different visitor types can have on spending/consumption patterns and resulting environmental consequences **\[3.4, 3.5\]**. 

 Overall, this body of research identified how event evaluations can be extended to effectively assess the environmental, as well as economic, impacts of major sporting and cultural events.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cardiff research identified how methodologies \(drawn from economics, geography and environmental planning\) could be combined to assess the environmental impacts of major events. Adoption of this approach nationally and internationally changed how policymakers, event organisers and consultants understand and evaluate the adverse environmental impacts of their events. This transformed impact evaluations of events, and informed planning, policies and actions through: 

1.  forming the environmental section of UK Sport’s ‘eventsIMPACTS’ toolkit. Since 2017, the widespread adoption of this toolkit has resulted in the staging of more sustainable events in the UK and across five continents; 

1.  establishing international best practice standards for evaluating event environmental impacts, through the Golf Environment Organisation Foundation. 

 **4.1 Transforming event impact evaluations** 

 UK Sport \(the government agency responsible for investing in Olympic and Paralympic sports in the UK\) first developed the eventIMPACTS toolkit in 2008 to standardise event impact methodologies. The toolkit is run on a collaborative basis between UK Sport and partners including: Department of Culture, Media and Sport; Discover Northern Ireland; Event Scotland; and Welsh Government. 

 A lack of understanding of and appropriate tools for evaluation in this version of the toolkit meant that event organisers were giving limited attention to the wider impacts of events. When updating the toolkit, the agency, “ *wanted the event sector to go beyond economic impacts when setting objectives for their events and calculating their impacts*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 The Cardiff research team was invited to revise the environmental section of the toolkit. Crickmore stated that “ *partners specifically wanted to work with Dr. Andrea Collins and Prof. Max Munday at Cardiff University when revising the environmental section of eventIMPACTS due to their research expertise in evaluating events and their environmental impacts*” **\[5.1\]**. The Cardiff team’s redevelopment of the environment section of the toolkit and associated resources, based on **\[3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]** included: 

-  the case for measuring the environmental impact of events; 

-  guidance on which environmental impacts should be considered; 

-  specific cases studies \(based on their own research\) demonstrating methodological approaches and measurement tools **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. 

 The eventIMPACTS toolkit is now used extensively by UK Sport to enhance understanding of event environmental impacts and transform event impact evaluations. Crickmore stated that UK Sport “ *specifically uses the toolkit when making financial decisions on which events to support”,* and signposts organisations to the environmental section of eventIMPACTS “ *to determine how they might undertake their own research and a broader evaluation of environmental impacts”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.2 Staging more sustainable sporting and cultural events** 

 Around 3,000 individuals and organisations in the UK and across five continents have registered to use the transformed toolkit. In 2017, Munday and Collins collaborated with UK Sport to undertake a survey of registered toolkit users. The 50 responses showed that eventIMPACTS had been used to assess the economic and environmental impacts of sporting and cultural events by a wide range of organisations \(including businesses, not\-for\-profits, consultants, event organisers and governments\) across 13 countries worldwide \(England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, Serbia, Cyprus, Singapore, Australia, South Africa and Columbia\) **\[5.3\]**. 

 The toolkit informed planning decisions, policies and actions, and led to the staging of more sustainable events, as reported by users in the survey **\[5.3\]**. The survey identified two main benefits of the toolkit. Firstly, it found that 47% of organisations strongly agreed it had enhanced their understanding of event environmental impacts and their evaluation; and 31% of organisations strongly agreed it had advanced their thinking about how to reduce these impacts. For example, John Coxeter\-Smith \(CEO of Sagacity Management Consultancy Services\) stated that eventIMPACTS has been an “ *invaluable*” resource for the Panamanian Government and Panama City Government: “ *We are confident, that it has at least opened Government ‘minds’ and hopefully enhanced…\[their\] understanding of the wider environmental impacts of the \[2022 Central American and Caribbean\] Games and beyond the Games, methodologies for assessing impacts and indicators they might use*” **\[5.4\]**. The Games will involve 6,000 athletes from 37 nations. 

 Secondly, the survey found that 22 organisations responding to the survey had directly used resources from the environmental section of eventIMPACTS to inform event planning and operation decisions; and 27% had reduced the negative environmental impact of their events as a result of using the toolkit. For example, Clare Hartley \(Director of ARC Events Consultancy\) stated that the UK’s National School Games “ *found the case studies and guidance on measuring \[environmental\] impact invaluable, specifically on food and drink and reducing waste”; “reduced single use plastic water bottles by more than 50%, from 55,000 in 2017 to 20,000 in 2018”;* and significantly changed its branding policy; “ *Previously we spent about £120,000 on branding, last year we spent £50,000 as we reuse so much more. We have been able to reduce costs, but also reduce waste*” **\[5.5\]**. 

 The research also changed the event planning decisions and CO2e \(carbon dioxide equivalent\) emissions of two major annual national events in Wales. Between 2017 and 2019, the research team collaborated with Run4Wales, organisers of the Cardiff Half Marathon \(20,000 participants and 65,000 spectators\) and the National Eisteddfod \(45,000 visitors\), to apply the measurement tools and guidance from the environmental section of eventIMPACTS. Surveys conducted at both events in 2017 provided new information on visitor profiles, their travel behaviour and its associated environmental impact, and factors influencing travel choices. In 2018, organisers of both events used this research to inform event planning decisions and encourage more sustainable travel choices **\[5.6, 5.8\]**. 

 A joint report by the research team and Run4Wales showed resulting changes to travel patterns and a 49% reduction in CO2e travel\-related emissions at the Cardiff Half Marathon **\[5.7\]**. An 18% reduction in CO2e travel\-related emissions was achieved at the National Eisteddfod **\[5.8\]**. Matt Newman \(CEO of Run4Wales\) stated that the research “ *greatly enhanced our understanding of runners’ spending activities and their environmental impact*”; enabled them to be “ *better equipped to minimise the environmental impact of our race catalogue*”; “ *make real progress towards staging a more sustainable race*”; and directly informed the scope of their first Environmental Policy and Green Action Plan **\[5.6\]**. 

 **4.3 Environmental event impact evaluations for international golf tournaments** 

 In 2016, Cardiff research influenced the development and scope of the first International Sustainability Standard for Golf Tournaments via the Golf Environment Organisation Foundation \(GEO\) Expert Group. GEO is a not\-for\-profit that supports the international golf community to embrace sustainability. Collins represented the Cardiff team on the group developing the Standard **\[5.9\]**, sharing the team’s research findings on event environment impact evaluation. She was  the sole academic member of the group. She shared the expertise developed by the whole Cardiff research team in event environmental impact evaluations. Jonathan Smith, CEO of GEO, stated: *“your expertise and knowledge…was invaluable in developing the criteria, scope and guidance”* for the Standard *.* **\[5.10\]**. The research informed the scope of the new Standard and was incorporated as mandatory criteria for achieving GEO® Tournament Certification **\[5.9, 5.10\]**. 

 Smith stated that the Standard “ *changed how GEO, the golf industry and tournament organisers consider the environmental impacts of golf tournaments, specifically in relation to the scope of a tournament’s carbon footprint, spectator travel…and sustainable food and drink*” **\[5.10\]**. The Standard’s credibility also led to the following direct strategic impacts **\[5.10\]**: 

-  accelerated sustainability commitments in golf and through golf; 

-  raised awareness of the importance and need to address environmental and social sustainability at professional and amateur golf events; 

-  raised expectations within the industry to meet the Standard; 

-  elevated other tournaments to be more comprehensive by broadening their scope and deepening the delivery. 

 Since the launch of the Tournament Standard in 2017, Smith noted: “ *six major golf tournaments have achieved GEO® certification including RBC Heritage \(US, 2017\); Waste Management Phoenix Open \(US, 2017, 2018 and 2019\) \(the world’s largest golf tournament with 720,000 spectators\); the US Kids Venice Open \(Italy, 2018 and 2019\); Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational \(US, 2019\) \(with 35,000 spectators\) and the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro\-Am \(US, 2019\) \(with 150,000 spectators\) and…The Foshian Open \(China, 2019\) \- the first tournament in the Asia Pacific”* **\[5.10\]**. 

 The CJ Cup \(South Korea\) and AT&T Byron Nelson \(US\) have committed to working towards certification, and twelve tournaments \(in US, Europe, Asia and South Africa\) are using the Standard as a guide to implement sustainability **\[5.10\]**. The Standard is also directly informing the International Olympic Committee for Olympic Sports **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Northampton’s \(UoN\) recent Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with Lightpoint Medical, graded ‘outstanding’ by the funding body, Innovate UK, resulted in the innovation of the company’s design process for their medical devices. Researchers from the Art and Design department worked with Lightpoint medical to embed new operating procedures into their company, focussed on user centred design, and to navigate the complex regulatory environment governing the manufacturing and distribution of these products. This resulted in improved product design and the development of **SENSEI**, a new device for radio\-guided laparoscopic surgery in cancer patient’s treatment. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Art and Design has a long history of research into user centred design through KTPs. This research has provided new inclusive, iterative and objective driven design methods, with a focus on the role of design as a project management tool **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**. 

 Their recent work has focused on the cross\-disciplinary benefits of KTPs with the medical industry, through which they have targeted medical innovations and the development of medical devices **\[3.4\]**. In 2019, **Dr** **Friedemann Schaber** and **Steve McGonigal** began a research partnership with Lightpoint Medical, a medical device company dedicated to improving health outcomes for cancer patients through precision guided surgery. Lightpoint Medical develops surgical imaging technology to scan for cancerous tumours, and instruments to detect cancerous tissue within the body to more accurately direct surgeons during surgery. **Schaber** and **McGonigal** worked with the company to develop a product prototype to create new surgical advances in laparoscopic surgery, embed user\-centred design within the company’s product development process, and update their existing products **\[3.4\]**. 

 The research led to a proof of principle concept for **SENSEI**<sup>®</sup><sup>.</sup> The researchers defined the requirements for the product through observing and documenting user simulations, prototype testing, pre\-clinical and clinical trials both in the UK and within Europe. They developed an in\-depth knowledge of stakeholder requirements and subsequent user needs. The resulting product design prioritised optimising spatial detection and probe sensitivity, intuitive physical manipulation, clearly visible and audible notifications, and easy to interpret outputs, while also strictly adhering to international standards for regulatory safety requirements **\[3.4\]**. 

 In addition to their research on individual product design, the researchers translated their knowledge into a new product development process to define and refine products. Overall, their research has identified new opportunities for networked partnerships between medical device manufacturers, technology developers, healthcare practitioners – especially clinicians and nuclear medicine staff – and academic researchers.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research supported Lightpoint Medical’s product design process. This occurred through embedding user\-centred design in their planning process and increasing ‘the breadth of information substantially within the company’ **\[5.1\]**. As a result, Lightpoint Medical has improved their product design, been able to successfully navigate the regulatory environment, and increase the efficiency of their product for treating cancers, with impacts on both doctors and their patients. The success of this partnership was reflected by the funding body, Innovate UK, who graded it as an ‘outstanding’ knowledge transfer partnership **\[5.2\]**. 

 **Changing Operating Procedures and Product Design Methods for Lightpoint Medical** 

 Lightpoint Medical formalised the researcher’s methodology and guidelines for best practice within the company's product development process, and introduced a new standard operating procedure **\[5.3, 5.4\]**. This includes ‘increased capabilities within user\-centred design’, with the integration of a high level of user engagement, usability observations and interviews into the product design process; additionally, a user interaction framework has been established to guide the future development of the company’s products **\[5.1\]**. The research also led to the development of an anatomical pelvic phantom to aid current and future development work and reduce the reliance on animal studies though providing a non\-patient method for training users. The new protocols and procedures have improved ‘efficiency throughout product development and commercialisation’ within the company **\[5.1\]**. 

 As a result of working in partnership a new position, Creative Product Designer was established \(2020\) to ensure the new standard operating procedures are implemented in all future product designs. Lightpoint has ‘permanently embedded \[the post\] within the company’ to ensure ‘that usability remains integral to the company’s product development process for future innovations’ **\[5.4\]**. Additionally, the company has increased their investment in research and development, including the engineering team and the team for clinical project management, resulting in five new staff members **\[5.1, p. 10\]**. 

 The partnership also resulted in the establishment of new ‘long\-term collaborations with leading clinicians’ **\[5.4\]**. This improved the functionality and marketability of products by embedding a ‘corporate culture of usability and user\-centred design’ **\[5.4\]** into the product development process. Overall, the research created a cultural change within the organisation, ensuring ‘that usability and user\-centred design is fully valued and implemented’ as ‘a central component of the company's development’ **\[5.1\]**. This has ensured that the companies technologies are highly responsive to user needs, ‘increasing the potential for clinical translation, commercialisation and improving patient outcomes’ **\[5.1\]**. 

 **Creation and Development of New Products** 

 The new design process has resulted in bringing the raw prototype for **SENSEI**<sup>®</sup> to clinical trials, though the trials have been delayed by the Covid pandemic. **SENSEI**<sup>®</sup> has been submitted for CE marking, receiving a first official audit, which took place in October 2020 with the report pending. In addition, **SENSEI**<sup>®</sup> has received US FDA approval for investigative use \(see https://senseisurgical.com\). The proof of principle research allowed Lightpoint Medical to incorporate usability and user centred design from the very early stages of the development of their laparoscopic imaging device, changing the way the product was manufactured. This resulted in a device that more accurately identifies cancerous tissue, using minimal\-access surgery, and minimises the amount of adjacent normal tissue removed, reducing short\-term problems, bed\-stay, and chances of recurrence. The user\-centred development process ensured the product addressed these unmet user needs. As a result of the KTP, Lightpoint have increased investment in clinical trials for **SENSEI**<sup>®</sup>, as well as for additional research and development of future versions of the technology by GBP1,350,000 **\[5.1, p. 10\]**. 

 Existing products, such as Lightpath \(Imaging System\), are also being re\-evaluated through the new design process, to improve user acceptability, and spatial detection and sensitivity, and are also entering new clinical trials to assess improved performance, and potential in new applications. 

 **Helping navigate regulatory policies** 

 The regulatory environment for the development of medical devices changed considerably 

 during the project period, with the transition in the EU to the Medical Device Regulation \(EU\) 

 2017/745 \(MDR\). Under the MDR, the requirements on medical device manufacturers to demonstrate thorough usability engineering for regulatory approval is now much more stringent and onerous. Lightpoint’s Chief Operating Officer has testified that the research partnership was ‘essential in ensuring that the product fully \[met\] the needs of robotic cancer surgery’ contributing to its ‘regulatory approval’ **\[5.4\]**. This has better positioned the company for the market and increased commercialisation of the company’s products. The laparoscopic device has received international safety standards approval, and entered an international phase I Clinical Trial in January 2020, though the conclusion of this trial may be delayed by the Covid\-19 pandemic.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Montoya\-Londoño’s research on the Colombian peace process has informed political and media debates on transitional justice, how they are framed, and the way they are understood by policy\-makers, professionals and the public. 

 The research achieved the following impacts: 

-  Contributed to the understanding of key Colombian officials about the role of land restitution and media and political narratives in the peace process. 

-  Increased awareness and understanding among non\-specialist audiences \(in the UK, France, and Colombia\) about the challenges of the Colombian peace process and the importance of political and media discourse to its viability and sustainability \(reach of 289,000; audience of up to 550,000\). 

-  Influenced the thinking of journalists, key communicators and leading professionals in Colombia and Latin America about the contribution of media to a post\-conflict environment. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research, undertaken between 2014 and 2017 by Dr Catalina Montoya\-Londoño and  Professor Maryluz Vallejo Mejía \(Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Colombia\), concerns how media framing in response to the *Law 1448 of Victims and Land Restitution* in Colombia had a negative impact on the attempt to establish a sustainable peace in the country. This law came into force in 2012, as the Colombian Government began peace negotiations with the left\-wing guerrillas of FARC \(Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia\). It sought to end decades of armed conflict by applying a transitional justice framework to compensate victims. It also aimed at tackling rural development to ensure the sustainability of the initiative in line with international economic and food security goals. 

 An agreement reached in May 2013 included provisions for integral rural reform \(the first point of the negotiation agenda\), including greater access to land, support for smallholders and cooperatives, infrastructure, credit subsidies, technical assistance, training, food security, and socio\-economic development. However, media coverage suggests that key economic and political sectors did not support it. 

 The research examines how news media framed the debate on the application of this Law, and how media discourse on land restitution undermined the possibility of a sustained and enduring peace process. 

 The research made the following key findings 

1.  Organisations advocating democratization of land and protection of smallholdings \(supported by influential international NGOs\) opposed a global policy consensus which prioritised commercialisation of rural land \(linked to the international market\) as the path to development and food security. As such, they ran counter to the interests of powerful groups within Colombia who stand to benefit from policies centred on commercialisation. **\(R1, R2, R3, R4\)** 

1.  National and regional Colombian media carried a clear bias in favour of dominant economic interests which were opposed to the reforms promoted by grass\-roots social organisations. The priorities of the former were more prominent and relatively unchallenged.  \( **R3, R4**\) 

1.  Mainstream Colombian newspapers tended to favour the government’s strategy of encouraging market\-oriented rural development via the Law of Victims and Land Restitution, whilst reproducing conservative elite concerns about preserving existing socioeconomic structures. **\(R3, R4\)** 

1.  Alternative approaches that may have addressed structural inequalities in land ownership or emphasised justice in response to land\-grabs during armed conflict were not a significant part of public debate because they were excluded from important mainstream sources of information used by the general public. **\(R3, R4\)** 

1.  It identified clear links between opposition to the restitution of land and opposition to the peace agreement. The negative political and media framing of the law was co\-opted by the ‘No’ campaign in the 2016 referendum to ratify the peace agreement. This was led by the main right\-wing political party, challengers in the forthcoming Presidential elections in 2018. **\(R1, R4\)** 

1.  On this basis, the research concludes that the way in which reporting and debate was framed was counterproductive to a sustainable and enduring peace process in Colombia. **\(R1, R2, R3, R4\)** 

1.  Articles linking the Law with the wider peace process in Colombia received less favourable or prominent coverage at a time when agrarian reform was being negotiated as part of it \(a key demand of FARC, with whom the government was negotiating was the democratization of land tenure\) **\(R3, R4\)**. Such coverage was arguably detrimental to the peace process.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 The research achieved impact by contributing to public debates and influencing the ideas and practices of those engaged in relevant activities. It has contributed to challenging and changing attitudes towards transitional justice as a key element in the Colombian peace process and improving public understanding of the conflict. It has also engaged with practitioners on issues of conflict resolution and peace\-building more generally. 

 The findings outlined above formed the basis of a programme of outreach, including events, activities and media engagement that have increased the awareness of the role of media narratives and discourses in framing debates about and influencing the trajectory of the peace process in Colombia.  As well as reaching those who have a direct interest in the specific issue – that is, communications specialists, journalists and political actors in Colombia itself – it also speaks to the role of media and other actors in framing in conflicts more generally, and their importance in the sustainability of peace and vital structural reform. Therefore, impact has reached wider audiences in Latin America, the UK and Europe too. 

 Key beneficiaries and impact can be summarised in overview as follows: 

 **\(I1\) Embassy of Colombia in the UK**: played a key role in contributing to understanding of key embassy staff about the role of land restitution and how public debate in Colombia is shaped by media and political narratives. 

 **\(I2\) General audiences** \(activists, members of the public\): providing insight into the complexities of the peace process, what the stumbling blocks are and what role individuals can play in addressing those problems 

 **\(I3\) Journalists and communicators**: influencing the thinking of journalists, key communicators and leading professionals in Colombia and Latin America about the contribution of media to a post\-conflict environment. 

 **The Impacts** 

 **\(I1\) Embassy of Colombia in the UK** 

 Jose R. Puyana, Minister Counsellor at the Colombian embassy in the UK 2017\-2019, stated that “a very important part” of the government’s approach to the peace process was to engage with members of the public and academics in different parts of the world “to discuss … the nature of the peace process” \(1\). 

 Dr Montoya\-Londoño arranged with Mr Puyana to bring to Liverpool the Colombian Ambassador to the UK \(and former permanent representative of Colombia to the United Nations\), Néstor Osorio Londoño, in order to establish a dialogue with Colombian government officials about the main research findings of her book \(R4\) and therefore help feed them into the process \(9\). 

 In particular, Dr Montoya’s contribution “provided a great context on the issue of land restitution which played a significant role in the process” \(1\). Findings about the sustainability of the peace process in the light of political opposition and terms of public debate in Colombia were shared with the ambassador. 

 Feeding back on the event, Mr Puyana commended Dr Montoya\-Londoño’s research, saying that her “efforts and research initiatives … have contributed significantly to understanding Colombia’s armed conflict and the path to peace” and to understanding “the Colombian peace process and the progress made by Colombia in implementing the peace accords” \(1\). 

 **\(I2\) General Audiences** 

 Impact was achieved through public events, increasing awareness / understanding amongst non\-specialist audiences \(in the UK, France, Germany and Colombia\) about challenges in transitioning to peace and the importance of political and media discourse to the process’s viability and sustainability. Activity also supported greater understanding of the links between Colombia’s experience and other conflicts. This was particularly pertinent in Merseyside, an area with significant Irish connections. 

 An event organised in Liverpool open to a general audience, *“Negotiating Peace in Colombia,* outlined two different perspectives on the process. It was, according to feedback from the audience of researchers, activists and members of the public, ‘very informative’, and provided  ‘a vivid picture of the prevailing situation’. It brought ‘a detailed insight on \[sic\] the reality, complexity and consequences of the peace process’ and highlighted ‘the similarities that exist \(with\) … Northern Ireland’, as well as ‘other situations around the world where peacebuilding can benefit’. Crucially, it also brought insight into ‘the stumbling blocks to the peace process’ and ‘the individual role we all can play in order to achieve peace’ \(3\). Following this event, a key contributor to it, Colombian activist and researcher, Martha Caceres, said she was ‘even more motivated to keep working on peace and take my learning to other places’ \(4\). 

 Dr Montoya\-Londoño used a radio interview on the lunchtime show on BBC Radio Merseyside \(which had 289,000 listeners during this period\) to demonstrate the links between the Colombian Peace Process and the UK’s experience, particularly with relation to Northern Ireland and more recent challenges related to terrorism in the UK.\(5\). 

 She also contributed to ‘The Peace Campus’ \(Campus pour la paix\) a key initiative of *Faites La Paix*, a French programme which promotes understanding of the causes of war and conflict and supports building and maintaining peace by encouraging ‘actors of different nationalities, of all ages and of various faiths, to pool their efforts as peacemakers’\) \(10\). It does so through arts and public education events, including ‘The Peace Campus’ \(11\), an international gathering of more than 630 activists, academics, students and members of the general public held in Lille on 20 April 2018 \(12\), coinciding with the centenary of the ending of the First World War. Dr Montoya\-Londoño conducted a workshop on the key theme of the role of civilians in war and peace, and specifically generating awareness of how the political and media debates were hampering sustainability of the peace process in Colombia. 

 Finally, Dr Montoya\-Londoño’s book with Dr Vellejo Melija, *The Boundaries of Land Restitution,* was launched at the 30<sup>th</sup> Bogota International Book Fair \(FILBo\) in May 2017. This is ‘one of the most important literary events of Latin America’ \(6\) and ‘the continent’s biggest celebration of reading’ \(8\). In 2017 it was celebrating its 30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary. There were 550,000 visitors \(7\). The book “was the second most sold” by the Javeriana University Press at the event and “readers gained awareness” of the “narratives of different sectors” concerning the Law of Victims and Land Restitution \(2\). 

 **\(I3\) Journalists and Communications Professionals** 

 Dr Montoya\-Londoño’s co\-researcher, Dr Vallejo Mejia presented the fruits of their research, which thus contributed to the understanding of journalists, key communicators and leading professionals in Colombia and Latin America about how media language and discourses contribute to the post\-conflict environment. The presentation was  at *VIII Encuentro de Periodismo Investigativo* \(“VIII Meeting of Investigative Journalism” in Colombia \(20\-21 March, 2015\), an annual event attended by hundreds of journalists, communication professionals and NGOs engaged with media and conflict, as well as academics and students from Colombia and all over the world. The theme of the event was “The challenges of journalism in post\-conflict”. It was organised by Consejo de Redacción, an NGO dedicated to promote investigative journalism \(13\).

 **Summary of the Impact** 

 The combined *significance* of the research of McEvoy, Mallinder and Bryson is its profound, sustained and multi\-layered impact upon the legal, policy and public understanding of dealing with the legacy of the Northern Ireland \(NI\) conflict. First, their local and international research on amnesties, truth recovery and the value added of oral history to transitional justice has directly influenced efforts to deal with the past in NI since 2014. Second, working in partnership with the local human rights NGO, the Committee on the Administration of Justice \(CAJ\), they have produced a substantial body of policy\-focused research which has directly impacted political negotiations in NI \(2014\-2015\), UK draft legislation \(2018\) and the deliberations of parliamentary select committees in the UK \(2017/2019/2020\) on legacy in NI. Third, from 2017, their research has directly influenced the political and public debate on a statute of limitations for security force veterans who served in NI. The *reach* of their impact has included the UK and Irish governments, NI political parties, civil society groups \(including victims and survivors\) and the United Nations. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 <ins> *Research Context*</ins> 

 NI endured an armed conflict \(1968\-1998\) that claimed more than 3,600 lives. In 2017 the Northern Ireland Victims and Survivors Commission reported that 26% of the adult population identified as victims due to harms directly experienced or bereavement. 1,186 murders remain unresolved. In 2014, the British and Irish governments and 5 NI political parties agreed in the Stormont House Agreement \(SHA\) to establish 4 complementary mechanisms to deal with the past via Westminster legislation. They are a Historical Investigations Unit \(HIU\); an Oral History Archive \(OHA\); an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval \(ICIR\); and an Implementation and Reconciliation Group \(IRG\). Draft legislation was consulted on in 2018 and the government committed to passing a legacy Bill in 2020 but this was delayed due to the pandemic. 

 <ins> *Research Insights and Impact*</ins> 

 The team has produced a significant body of underpinning research in transitional justice, the interdisciplinary field that addresses how societies deal with legacies of violence and human rights abuses. Their research has explored key themes including how to effect change in transitional justice through expert mobilisation ‘from below’, how to encourage effective truth recovery through amnesties, immunity and sentence reduction and the value added of oral history to reconciliation. They have also conducted fieldwork in over a dozen countries on how transitional justice mechanisms work \(or not\) in practice \(including Colombia, South Africa, Argentina, Chile, Uganda and Sierra Leone\). This body of research has underpinned the team’s direct and material impact on efforts to deal with the legacy of the NI conflict. Indicative examples include: **R1** argued that dealing with the past should not be left to top\-down, state\-centric elite actors and that civil society, with appropriate legal expertise, can help to shape and direct transitional justice. It provided the theoretical framework for the team’s impact work on legacy in NI. **R2** identified criteria relating to when it may be permissible to waive prosecutions for human rights violations under international human rights law. This output shaped the team’s work on trading immunity for truth recovery and the debate on a statute of limitations. McEvoy’s contribution to this piece interrogated the intersection between amnesties/immunity, conflict transformation and the rationales for punishment. In **R3**, drawing upon over 200 NI conflict\-related interviews, Bryson provided a root and branch review of the contribution of oral history to transitional justice. This shaped the team’s approach to the role and function of the proposed Oral History Archive. **R4** includes a ‘Model Bill’ together with critical analysis of how NI legacy legislation should be guided by international and domestic human rights law and best practice from their experience in the field of transitional justice. McEvoy’s contribution was on investigations, immunity and reconciliation and Bryson’s focus was oral history. **R5** examined the particular utility of specialist knowledge in shaping relations within a given ‘epistemic community’ and its effect on influencing policy on legacy in NI. In **R6** Mallinder analysed how some stakeholders in NI have sought to advance narrow and partial interpretations of international human rights law to restrict investigations and prosecutions of past offences. It informed the team’s policy responses to proposals for immunity from prosecution.

","
 **4.** **Details of the Impact** 

 Below are indicative examples of how the team’s research has directly influenced debates on legacy since August 2013. It also details the reach and significance of that impact. 

### 1.  Impact on Draft Legislation to enact the SHA \(2013\-2014\) 

 During the negotiations which led to the SHA, the team drew on their research on ‘transitional justice from below’ **\[R1\]** and on the ways to encourage truth recovery and amnesties **\[R2\]** to propose models for the negotiating parties on how this could be facilitated in NI. One model they put forward \- which suggested limited immunity in return for truth rather than a broader amnesty \- was ultimately adopted in the SHA. As the DUP lead legacy negotiator Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said, *‘We have met with Kieran McEvoy and his colleagues and listened to what they have to say. We have made it clear both in public and in private that we are opposed to amnesties for terrorist murder. However, limited immunity is a separate concept’* **\[S1\]**. Following the SHA, there have been intermittent high\-level negotiations on advancing legacy \(see below\). The team continued to draw on their research to develop proposals to overcome successive political and legal obstacles. The sustained value of these interventions was noted by Sinn Féin lead negotiator and former IRA leader Gerry Kelly: *‘the Model Bill team have over many years provided an informed contribution to complex legacy discussions…\[and\] their work has informed considerations of both governments and the political parties, while also developing wider public understanding of legacy issues’* **\[S2\]**. 

### 1.  Impact on Draft Legislation to Enact the SHA \(2015\-2021\) 

 Soon after the SHA’s publication in Dec 2014, working with a parliamentary draftsperson, the team developed a 48pp ‘Model Bill’ from the SHA 5pp ‘heads of agreement’. This ‘Model Bill’ **\[R4, R5\]**, launched at the House of Lords in 2015, contains 70 detailed clauses with a further 41pp of explanatory notes and a model treaty on the ICIR setting out what that Agreement would look like in human rights compliant legislation. McEvoy, with the NGO partner, CAJ, led on investigations/truth recovery and reconciliation \(HIU, IRG\); Mallinder and McEvoy on prosecutions/immunity \(ICIR\); and Bryson on oral history \(OHA\). The legal and political complexities involved have been discussed at over 20 meetings with the UK government legislation drafting team, their Irish counterparts, and politicians from across the political spectrum. The team also raised civil society awareness and sought feedback on emerging drafts by hosting public events, conferences and seminars \(see below\). Key provisions of the government’s Draft NI Stormont House Agreement Bill 2018 \(henceforth ‘SHA Bill’ **\[S4\]**\) were directly influenced by the team’s ‘Model Bill’ e.g. \(i\) the governance arrangements, powers and funding of the HIU \(SHA Bill Clauses 2\-15, 24, and Schedules 3\-8\); \(ii\) the limited immunity provisions in return for information recovery of the ICIR and the importance of credibility testing information \(SHA Bill Clauses 42,44,45\); \(iii\) the independence, governance and ethical standards of the OHA \(SHA Bill Clauses 51,52,56\) *;* \(iv\) the remit and operation of the ICIR \(SHA Bill Clauses 59,62, Schedule 17\). As a former under\-Secretary of State for NI confirmed in a letter to the UoA partner CAJ *‘I would like to acknowledge the input that you and others have brought to the Shadow Bill \[Model Bill\] project, and I know my officials have found this to be a useful and innovative way of engaging in parallel with the development of the \[government\] Bill*’ **\[S3\]**. The team’s \(159pp\) response to the Draft Bill was in turn widely used by civil society groups in their own responses during the legislation consultation \(see reach below\). 

### 1.  Providing a Solution to the National Security Impasse \(2015\) 

 In 2015, political negotiations on implementing the SHA broke down over the issue of UK national security. In particular, nationalist victims of state violence threatened to withdraw support for the SHA over a perceived ‘British veto’ on truth recovery. The Model Bill team worked closely with the two principal nationalist victims’ groups, the two main nationalist parties \(Sinn Féin and the SDLP\) and the Irish government to devise a model that could re\-establish confidence **\[R5\]**. A version of this model, allowing for a judicial determination as to what constitutes a legitimate national security concern, is contained in Clause 21 the UK government’s 2018 Draft Bill. Commenting on this work, then Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade stated: *‘the model which you have presented to Secretary of State Villiers and I is a most valuable and constructive contribution to the deliberations on the establishment of the legacy institutions and the crux issue of onward disclosure* **\[S5\]**. 

1.  **Finding a Legally Viable Solution to the Statute of Limitations Impasse \(2017\-21\)** 

 In 2017, following the arrest and prosecution of British soldiers for NI conflict\-related offences, British army veterans began to campaign to end what they dubbed a ‘witch\-hunt’ against security personnel. The Model Bill team submitted a detailed written submission on this issue to the House of Commons Defence Select Committee \(DSC\) **\[S6a\]** and McEvoy gave oral evidence, arguing that a blanket statute of limitations for soldiers would be unlawful under international law and would inevitably be applied to former paramilitaries **\[S6a\]**. He put forward an alternative method of reducing conflict\-related jail time to ‘zero’ while retaining the prosecutorial, truth recovery and reconciliation components of the SHA. McEvoy’s oral evidence and the team’s underpinning research are cited 16 times in the DSC report and the Committee drew directly and explicitly from these options in their written report to government. It concludes *‘to borrow Professor McEvoy’s phrase, the space for legal imagination resides in responding to historic allegations against former service personnel’* **\[S6a, p20\]**. In a letter to the UoA, then NI Director of Public Prosecutions \(the legal body with statutory responsible for decisions on conflict\-related prosecutions\) described McEvoy’s arguments to the Committee *as ‘a tour de force’* adding, ‘ *His contributions were measured, knowledgeable and legally robust while at the same time seeking to find principled but workable solutions to these complex and challenging issues’* **\[S7\]**. While the Conservative\-dominated DSC recommended a statute of limitations for NI, this has not been implemented. Indeed, in subsequent correspondence to DSC Chairperson, the former Secretary of State for NI referred to the evidence presented to the DSC when stating that such an amnesty would be against international law and would inevitably apply to former paramilitaries **\[S8\]**. In 2018\-19, McEvoy was invited to attend a series of meetings with the Chief of the General Staff of the British Army, the head of Army Legal Services and others, and agreed to further develop ‘zero jail time options’ which are lawful and compatible with the SHA Agreement. The Model Bill team published a detailed report on this in April 2020. The NI Affairs Committee discussed that report at Westminster. The team is cited 6 times in the Committee’s report **\[S6b\]**. In questioning the former Victims’ Commissioner, Claire Hanna MP referred to *‘the document from Kieran McEvoy, Louise Mallinder and others offering to reduce to zero jail time. Do you think that could be workable or acceptable to victims?*’ The former Commissioner replied, *‘that team did have a session with the Victims and Survivors Forum and worked through those options… For most people they felt they could live with that’* **\[S6c\]**. This report was also the focus of high\-level discussions including a private meeting \(Nov 2020\) chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth Palace involving McEvoy and Bryson, the NIO Permanent Secretary and Director of Legacy, Irish government equivalents, former Victims’ Commissioner, the British Army’s Head of Legal Affairs, senior loyalist and republican ex\-combatants and senior police officers. 

### 1.  Evidence of Reach: Shaping the Public Conversation on NI Legacy Issues \(2015\-2021\) 

 The Model Bill team’s work has also had a substantial impact on building understanding, awareness and engagement among victims’ groups and other civil society actors with what are often legally complex legacy questions. To achieve this, the team has: routinely engaged in private bilateral meetings with key stakeholders; organised 20 public seminars and 6 conferences; made all project reports freely available online; and engaged extensively in media work. The team’s influence on civil society engagement on legacy is evidenced by citations of their reports. For example, publicly available responses to the government’s consultation on the draft legislation in 2018\-19 indicate that 19% \(8 of 43\) submissions directly cite McEvoy and/or the Model Bill team **\[S9a\]**. These include the Green Party, Amnesty International, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The latter is the largest civil society membership organisation in NI representing 215,000 members across 34 trade unions. It stated, *‘Our allies in the Committee on the Administration of Justice \(CAJ\) and QUB Law have already produced their joint submission to this process, which has our support*’ and: *‘We concur with the points made and concerns raised by the legal experts from CAJ/QUB Law’* **\[S9b\]**. In the most recent NI Affairs Committee inquiry into NI legacy, 12 \(33%\) of the 36 non\-QUB written submissions cite the team’s research including the Methodist Church in Ireland, NI Human Rights Commission and the Wave Trauma Centre **\[S6b, pp31\-33\]**. The former head of research and policy in the Commission for Victims and Survivors stated that the work of the Model Bill team: *‘has been crucial in informing the public debate… I know this public service has been particularly valued by victims from across the political spectrum’* **\[S10\]**. 

 As part of their efforts to inform the public debate on legacy, McEvoy, Mallinder and Bryson were also interviewed, referenced or quoted individually or collectively over 130 times in print, broadcast and online media \(2014\-20\). In print, they appeared in the *Financial Times* \(28 Aug 2015 & 2 Jun 2014 \- circulation of 155,000 per issue and 1,000,000 online subscribers\), *The Times* \(2 May 2017 & 27 Apr 2017\- circulation of 400,000 and 300,000 online subscribers\) and *The Irish Times* \(19 Mar 2015, 9 Apr 2020, 6 Dec 2020, \- circulation of 79,000 and 10,800,000 monthly online users\). They have written over 20 feature articles, Op Eds and blogs e.g. *The Guardian* \(11 May 2018 \- circulation 125,000 and 85,000,000 global monthly website users\), *The Irish Times* \(30 March 2018\) and the *Belfast Telegraph* \(5 April 2017, 19 June 2017 \- circulation 31,000 with 3,400,000 monthly users\). On radio, they were interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 programme PM \(21 Nov 2013 \- 4.11,000,000 listeners weekly\), LBC Radio’s Nick Ferrari show \(20 Jun 2018 – 1,300,000 listeners\) the BBC *Nolan Show* \(14 May 2018 & 22 Nov 2017 \- the most listened\-to radio show in NI, reaching 21% of the NI population\) and BBC Radio Ulster’s multi\-award winning daily political affairs *Talkback* \(4 March 2014, 20 June 2017, 7 March 2019, 5 & 7 Dec 2020\). They have appeared on UTV News \(8 May 2014\), *Sunday Politics* NI 13 May 2018 \(BBC’s flagship weekly politics show\) and seven times on UTV’s weekly politics programme, *The View from Stormont* \(e.g. 5 Mar 2019, 3 Oct 2017 & 6 Feb 2017\). When details of the Nov 2020 Lambeth Palace meeting were leaked, it made front\-page news in two of the three local newspapers and was the lead story on NI TV and radio news. The former PSNI Chief Constable said *‘Anyone who takes the time to read this \[Model Bill team\] report will see that it is trying to make sense of the legacy journey that we’ve been on and all the various stalled and failed attempts at resolving the legacy issue… it’s good that we have the brain power from academia … trying to nudge this thing forward’* **\[S11\]**. 

### 1.  International Impact 

 Finally, the team has had a significant impact on international scrutiny of the UK’s compliance with its human rights obligations regarding NI legacy matters. In 2015, they helped to coordinate a mission to NI by the then UN Special Rapporteur on Transitional Justice, directly impacting his report presented to the UN Human Rights Council in 2016. He confirmed in a letter to QUB Law: *‘Profs McEvoy and Mallinder and Dr Anna Bryson have significant international reputations in the field of transitional justice… Their research on trying to find human rights compliant solutions to NI legacy matters including truth recovery and national security considerations, justice, oral history and reconciliation was an invaluable resource for us and directly influenced my thinking in writing the country visit report I presented to the \[UN\] Human Rights Council… It is clear to me that their work has played a key role in anchoring the NI legacy conversations to the relevant international human rights standards, particularly in recent times in response to pressures in Westminster for a statute of limitations for former soldiers… Prof McEvoy edited a well\-known book some years ago called Transitional Justice from Below. This is what it looks like in practice’* **\[S12\].**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research since 2013 by Zaki Wahhaj and Amrit Amirapu in the School of Economics at the University of Kent has provided new insight and evidence on the drivers and consequences of early marriage in Bangladesh. It has enabled non\-profit organisations to: \(i\) engage with and shape policy debates at the national level on strategies for eliminating the practice \(Population Council, BLAST\); and \(ii\) develop an internationally funded intervention to provide adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh with better legal protection against early marriage \(MOMODa Foundation\), on the basis of rigorous economic models and empirical evidence. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The research on child marriage by Zaki Wahhaj and Amrit Amirapu, and the funded projects that supported their research, were conducted during a period of intense debate among policy\-makers and other stakeholders in Bangladesh about effective strategies to tackle the practice. Bangladesh, a country of 160 million people, has one of the highest rates of female early marriage, with about 60% of women marrying before the age of 18. \(The figure refers to the proportion of women between the ages of 20 and 24 who reported an age of first marriage below 18 in the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey.\) In 2015, the Bangladesh Government introduced a controversial draft bill in Parliament that would increase the legal punishment for underage marriage, but also decriminalise child marriages in cases where a court deemed it in ‘the best interest of the child’. 

 In 2014, Wahhaj, in partnership with the University of Malaya and with funding from Australian Aid **\[G1\]**, conducted a large\-scale nationally representative survey of women in Bangladesh that provided detailed, up\-to\-date information on female marriage patterns, education, fertility, and employment. The survey data enabled Wahhaj, together with Dr Asadullah at the University of Malaya, to produce rigorous new evidence on the social effects of early marriage on individuals who marry at a young age **\[R1, R3\]** \(period of research 2015\-19\). Their work made use of an empirical approach for estimating the causal impact of early marriage developed by Field and Ambrus \( *Journal of Political Economy*, 2008\) that involves instrumenting female age of marriage by age of onset of menarche. The work builds on this approach by making use of information on pairs of adult sisters – a unique feature of the Australian Aid\-funded survey – and an estimation strategy involving family fixed\-effects to take into account unobserved heterogeneity across families. This innovative research approach confirmed previous estimates of the impact of early marriage on schooling and the onset of fertility, and produced new evidence of the effects of early marriage on two outcomes not hitherto investigated in the literature: the impact on social networks, and attitudes regarding traditional gender norms. 

 A key argument made by civil society organisations in Bangladesh against the Government’s proposal to decriminalise early marriage in special circumstances is that it would make the practice more socially acceptable. To examine this argument, Amirapu, Asadullah, and Wahhaj conducted a set of field experiments in rural Bangladesh in which participants were informed about the Government’s new child marriage law that had recently been approved in the national Parliament. The study was undertaken in 2018, with funding from UK Aid **\[G2, G3\]**. It found that the effects of the intervention depend on who within an adolescent girl’s extended family is provided with the relevant legal information. In particular, the research team found a backlash effect of informing fathers and family elders about the law **\[R4\]** \(period of research 2018\-20\). It is one of the first studies to investigate, within an experimental setting, whether the law can be used to change social norms in a developing country. 

 In related work, Wahhaj developed and empirically tested a theoretical model of marriage markets with overlapping generations to explain the drivers of early marriage **\[R2\]** \(period of research 2013\-18\). Previous explanations of early marriage have assumed a preference for young brides within certain societies. The theoretical model discards this assumption but posits that there is imperfect information about the ‘quality’ of potential brides on the marriage market: postponing marriage sends a negative signal about one’s quality as a potential suitor, reflected in dowry prices, thus providing parents with a financial incentive to marry off their daughters at a young age. The paper thus highlights that early marriage may be due not to an inherent cultural preference for young brides, but, at least in part, to informational problems on the marriage market that give rise to higher dowry demands for older brides. This insight suggests how a range of policy options, including interventions that expand opportunities for adolescent girls, can reduce financial pressures to marry at an early age.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Research on female early marriage in Bangladesh by the submitting unit \(Wahhaj, Amirapu\) since 2013 has provided rigorous evidence on the drivers and consequences of early marriage in Bangladesh. It has enabled non\-profit organisations to engage with, and shape, policy debates at the national level on strategies for eliminating the practice, and to develop an intervention to provide adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh with legal protection against early marriage. 

 In 2015, the Bangladesh Government introduced a controversial draft bill that would decriminalise child marriages in cases where a court deemed it in ‘the best interest of the child’. A large swathe of non\-governmental organisations working on children’s rights and welfare opposed this move. In 2016, Wahhaj, together with co\-investigator Asadullah at the University of Malaya, began a collaboration with two non\-profit organisations – the Bangladesh Legal Aid Services Trust \(BLAST\) and the Population Council, New York – to articulate alternative strategies to tackle the issue of female early marriage, based on careful theoretical reasoning and research\-based evidence. Population Council is one of the world’s leading organisations in the design and evaluation of programmes aimed at the improvement of adolescent lives, including the elimination of early marriage **\[f\]**. BLAST is the largest legal services organisation in Bangladesh, providing legal aid to poor and disadvantaged clients, and pursuing public interest litigation cases before the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, including cases relating to gender rights **\[g\]**. 

 This collaboration produced policy\-related commentaries that drew extensively on child marriage research at the submitting unit **\[i\]**. The commentaries were published in policy journals and electronic and print media, including the *IZA Policy Paper Series* \(October 2016\), *Economic and Political Weekly* \(February 2017\) **\[a\]**, *The Conversation* \(March 2017\), *Project Syndicate* \(March 2017\), and *Ideas for India* \(April 2017\). The commentaries in *The Economic and Political Weekly* **\[a\]** and *The Conversation* are key references on child marriage on Bangladesh provided by the organisation Girls Not Brides on its website **\[b\]**. \(Girls Not Brides is an organisation initiated by The Elders in 2011 as a partnership of grassroots organisations around the world committed to ending the practice of child marriage.\) The *IZA* policy paper served as a key reference for a consultation with child marriage experts co\-organised by Population Council and BLAST in November 2016 **\[c\]**. The collaboration also led to formal discussions in Bangladesh on child marriage policy, co\-organised by the research team, BLAST and Population Council, to explore strategies for tackling the issue using rigorous research\-based evidence. Key stakeholders from the Bangladesh Government and a range of NGOs took part in the discussions, which received widespread media attention **\[d, e, f, g\]**. 

 This collaborative work enabled BLAST and Population Council to combine their own institutional knowledge regarding early marriage with the research generated by the submitting unit to propose innovative strategies for tackling the issue. According to Sajeda Amin, Senior Associate at Population Council: ‘The evidence on current marriage practices in Bangladesh by Asadullah and Wahhaj \(2016\) **\[R1\]**, and the conceptual work by Wahhaj \(2015\) **\[R2\]** helped inform the Population Council’s own approach to tackling female early marriage in South Asia \[…\] their research improved our understanding of the context and economic drivers of early marriage in Bangladesh today, and enabled Population Council to make the case for empowering adolescent girls more effectively in policy discussions.’ **\[f\]** 

 Sara Hossain, Executive Director of BLAST, wrote: ‘The findings from these studies **\[R1, R4\]** provided timely evidence on awareness and understanding of child marriage law in rural Bangladesh and the extent to which it affects marriage practices in a rural setting \[…\] \[and\] has improved our understanding at BLAST of how the law affects social attitudes and practices related to female early marriage. \[…\] The evidence generated through the innovative research by Dr Wahhaj and his co\-authors has been helpful for BLAST and other civil society organisations to influence public opinion, and government policy on tackling issues related to gender and child rights.’ **\[g\]** 

 Since 2018, Wahhaj has collaborated with the MOMODa Foundation, a non\-profit organisation that operates a range of social development programmes in northern Bangladesh, to design an intervention that ‘sought to enhance the use of the existing national birth registration system and establish a helpline to monitor and prevent underage marriages among adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh’. **\[h\]**. The design was informed by Wahhaj’s previous research, showing that the vast majority of early marriages in Bangladesh are due to family pressures **\[R1\]** stemming from fear that delaying marriage will lead to higher dowry demands **\[R2\]**. ‘Thanks to the evidence and insights provided by Dr Wahhaj and his research team, MOMODa Foundation was able to make an effective case to international funders for an intervention \[…\] to help create and update birth registration records for children in rural Bangladesh.’ **\[h\]** 

 MOMODa obtained an award of CAD 99,650 from Grand Challenges Canada to pilot the intervention in northern Bangladesh **\[j\]**. As scientific advisor to this project, Wahhaj also helped developed details of the intervention. In particular, based on the finding in **\[R4\]** that ‘informing rural households in Bangladesh about the legal penalties for facilitating female early marriage can lead to backlash effects \[…\] because of entrenched traditional views about appropriate marriage age’, Wahhaj advocated ‘highlighting to parents in the project area the wider benefits of having verified birth registration certificates for adolescent daughters rather than focusing on child marriage prevention as its sole objective’. **\[h\]**. The project initiated a campaign to raise awareness about a Government helpline for reporting gender\-based violence, and/or helped create or rectify birth registration records for adolescent girls, in a total of 180 rural communities \(with a population of about 1,800 adolescent girls\) **\[h\]**. 

 According to MOMODa Foundation: ‘The nuanced findings in Dr Wahhaj’s research have helped ensure that the project implementation in northern Bangladesh is sensitive to prevailing traditional norms, and achieve near universal valid birth certificates among adolescent girls \[by December 2020\]. \[…\] we believe that the universal birth registration of adolescent girls and improved knowledge about the government’s hotline for reporting gender\-based violence in the project area will provide adolescent girls better protection against early marriage.’ **\[h\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study concerns novel informatics modelling of at\-risk groups in terms of combined fire, health, social, and crime risk, enabling more accurate targeting of fire prevention. The impact of the research has been the adoption of the approach as a form of best practice \[A\] to improve targeting of fire prevention, and a contributing factor to significant reductions in accidental dwelling fires of 25% \(283 incidents\), and accidental dwelling fire injuries of 31% \(39 injuries\) across Merseyside between 2013 and 2020, resulting in a saving of £877,300 \(responding to a fire is estimated at £3,100 per incident\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 UK Accidental dwelling fires are costly both in economic and social terms. UK preventative health and social care measures such as smoking cessation, alcohol management, bowel cancer screening and elderly falls are proven to be effective both in economic and social terms to the NHS and local councils. However, it can be difficult to gain access to individuals to promote preventative measures. The research aims and objectives were to identify at\-risk community groups in Merseyside to enable active inter\-agency collaboration between fire and rescue, health, social care and police services, thus improving NHS and social services access to residents via fire and rescue services, and addressing causal factors associated with dwelling fires via NHS and social services. 

 The novel research into accidental dwelling fire risk and community safety incorporated associated risk factors within health care, social care and crime as a basis for detailed analysis of fire risk causal factors amongst different at risk social groups. An innovative customer segmentation model was developed by Lisboa, Taylor, Jarman, and Francis between 2010 and 2013 to provide analyses of at\-risk social groups in terms of combined fire, health, social care and crime risk \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]. This involved data modelling using data from numerous external agencies including the Department for Work and Pensions, the Office for National Statistics, and the NHS. The theoretical challenge of the research was to identify social groups and individuals considered at\-risk by a number of public sector agencies, resulting in a set of detailed community profiles. 

 The novelty of the research was a customer segmentation approach that identified combined fire, health, social care and crime risks to produce a set of community profiles \[5\]. The key findings from the research were the significant differences in fire risk levels across different community profiles. This research provided innovative customer insight for the partner public sector agencies to work collaboratively by signposting individuals and households to relevant partner agencies \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\] as part of a multi\-agency preventative approach. This included referrals to NHS smoking cessation and alcohol management services, and referrals to the local council for housing and social care issues \[5, 6\]. The modelling enabled differences in terms of the risk of ﬁre\-related injuries and fatalities between the population segments to be examined \[5\]. The community proﬁles were used to target areas of greater risk of particular types of ﬁres \(e.g. kitchen fires\). Over 80 percent of kitchen ﬁres occurred within three of the ten community proﬁle groups: students; young families with high beneﬁt need; younger, urban population living in high levels of deprivation. The student group in particular was targeted via a specific Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service \(MFRS\) website section and Facebook videos. The significance and impact of the research is the ability to identify and target at\-risk groups of joint interest to fire and rescue, health, social care and police services in order to support further fire incidence reduction. 

 The research was funded by the UK Department for Communities and Local Government \(2010 – 2012\) \(Grant awarded to Lisboa, Taylor, and Jarman\) \[7\] and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service \(MFRS\) \(2012 – 2013\) \(Grant awarded to Lisboa, Taylor, and Jarman\) \[8\]. The grants involved MFRS, Wirral Council, Wirral NHS PCT and Merseyside Police.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research resulted in two main areas of impact: fire safety and community safety. The fire safety impact concerned identifying and targeting vulnerable groups involved in accidental dwelling fires. This has increasingly involved concentrating on the most vulnerable social group, those aged 65\+ \[6\], due to ongoing MFRS budget reductions \[6\]. The community safety impact concerned identifying vulnerable groups in terms of health and social care risk, and referrals to other agencies \(NHS and local councils\) to address health risks associated with smoking, alcohol consumption, bowel cancer and elderly falls \[6\]. The HM Inspectorate of Constabularies and Fire and Rescue Services inspection in 2018\-2019 rated MFRS as outstanding in preventing fires and other risks, and commented that ‘The service has moved from offering universal home fire safety visits to concentrating on those at the highest risk from fire, based on robust research into the causes of fire deaths in Merseyside over the past decade’. The Chief Fire Officer for MFRS commented that: ‘The modelling has undoubtedly contributed to a significant reduction in accidental fires helping to make Merseyside a safer place’. 

 **Fire safety** 

 In terms of fire safety, the key areas of impact resulting from the research were reduced economic and social costs of fire, and improved service provision. The research provided a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of current fire prevention activities \[6\]. Between 2013 and 2020, there was a reduction in accidental dwelling fires of 25% \(283 incidents\), and a reduction in associated injuries of 31% \(39 injuries\) across Merseyside. In Merseyside in 2019/2020 there were 870 dwelling fire incidents and 87 fire injuries. This reduction in accidental dwelling fires and injuries is associated with improved targeting of fire prevention activities resulting from the research. The community profiling enabled more accurate identification of vulnerable groups and individuals, for example, the customer segmentation model found that those aged 65\+ were proportionately more likely to be injured or die in a dwelling fire than those aged less than 65 \[6\]. As a result of the research, more targeted home fire safety checks have resulted in fewer house fires \(down 25% from 2013/2014 to 2019/2020\), this has allowed MFRS to use resources more effectively. A key impact for MFRS of the research is that it has assisted in developing policies for adjusting to a reduced budget whilst maintaining a good level of service to the community \[B\]. 

 The financial impact of the research was measured by the reduced cost of responding to accidental dwelling fires. Responding to a fire is estimated at £3,100 per incident, therefore reducing the number of incidents amounted to an estimated saving of £877,300 over the period 2013 to 2020 \[C\]. The research has also enhanced collaboration with other agencies for more accurate targeting of preventative measures to the most vulnerable communities. The approach has been promoted by the UK Department of Communities and Local Government as being of benefit for Fire & Rescue Services across the UK and beyond \[A\]. 

 **Community Safety** 

 In terms of community safety, the key significant areas of impact resulting from the research were NHS savings from preventing falls and smoking cessation, and individuals being able to stay in their own homes. Referrals to other agencies as part of the enhanced fire prevention and community safety enabled by the research included: NHS smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, and bowel cancer screening referrals, and Local council social services Falls risk assessment referrals. The community safety model supports preventative measures that can save considerable funds in the medium term for the different public sector agencies involved. The research found that the majority of residents visited had factors present that could result in them becoming at risk from fire, and were signposted or referred onto another agency because additional risks or needs were identified \[A\]. This evidences the value of more accurate targeting of fire prevention activities as part of a multi\-agency preventative approach, by referring onto other agencies if additional risks are identified. 

 The Community Profiles developed by the research have been used by MFRS to develop new fire safety campaigns to better target Safe and Well visits based on known risk factors. This supports better targeting of fire risk, for example the concentration of fire prevention activities towards the elderly that represent the most at\-risk group in Merseyside. This has improved operational efficiency and improved decision making.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research into customer\-to\-customer interaction \(CCI\) has led to development of customer service strategy at The Hive \(a large library and council services hub\) and other libraries in the region. The research enabled a better managerial understanding of the complexity of the interactions taking place between customers in libraries, and an enhanced managerial appreciation of the potential for employees to contribute to the effective management of such interactions. The wider impacts of the research are social and cultural, by enabling a diversity of users \(e.g. different age, social class, ethnic background, purpose of visit\) to use public facilities simultaneously in a more harmonious and supportive environment. The impact of the research also extends to improving the wellbeing of employees faced with difficult CCI situations. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Traditionally, research in the area of customer\-to\-customer interaction \(CCI\) has focused on the customer’s perception of CCI. Nicholls’ research has been influential in shifting attention from the customer’s experience of CCI to the management of CCI. Nicholls’ research has focused on the frontline employee perspective on CCI. 

 The research that this case study is based on focused on enabling libraries and other community hubs to solve some of the issues they face with a diverse customer base simultaneously consuming a range of services, in a variety of consumption styles, in a shared physical service setting \(Reference 1 & 2\). These issues include: 

-  How a user copes with the physical presence of other users \(e.g. the sound and visual impacts of others\) 

-  How users share resources in a mutually acceptable way 

-  How a user copes with their perceptions of those different to themselves 

-  How users view the appropriateness of the activities that other users are engaged in 

 The need for effective and innovative ways to manage the interactions between fellow users of libraries and other community hubs is clear \(Reference 2\). There is a requirement to operate in an inclusive way that maximises the physical, mental and social comfort of users, and does not deter some groups from using the facilities. This gives rise to the concept of managing CCI, a key aspect of which is using frontline employees to detect, prevent and deal with negative CCI \(NCCI\) and to foster and endorse positive CCI \(PCCI\). The objectives of the main underpinning research were to gain insights into how frontline employees perceive and experience CCI, and to explore how they handle CCI. Details of the two studies follow: 

-  **Diversity and customer\-to\-customer interaction**: This research \(Reference1\) explored the concept of CCI in terms of customer diversity. It revealed that the prevailing perspective that customer diversity was problematic for CCI was an oversimplification and that diversity could in some circumstances be favourable for CCI. The study focused upon the consequences for CCI of customers being from different age groups. 

-  **Managing customer\-to\-customer Interaction**: This research \(Reference 2\) focused on exploring the capacity of frontline employees to provide insights into CCI and its management. The study found that frontline employees: \(i\) are able to recall CCI encounters with ease; \(ii\) are capable of conceptualising and exploring complex nuances surrounding CCI encounters; \(iii\) can distinguish levels of seriousness of negative CCI and variations in customer sensitivity to CCI; \(iv\) vary in their comfort in intervening in negative CCI situations.

","
 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The primary impact of the research has been on  [The Hive](http://www.thehiveworcester.org/) in Worcester, a University and Public Library, although it has also extended to other Library Services in the region. The Hive, developed in collaboration between the University of Worcester and Worcestershire County Council, was the first joint university and community library in Europe when it opened in 2012. The Hive also functions as a community hub, contains a significant exhibition space and houses a Business Centre. 150 staff \(both University and County Council\) work in the Hive. It attracts over 700,000 visitors per year \(making it the 8<sup>th</sup> most visited library in the UK in 2019\). Its event’s and exhibition’s programme is targeted across all age ranges from young children to older generations, so its visitor profile at any one time is very diverse. 

 The senior management team at the Hive approached Nicholls in 2015 to undertake a study of employee perspective on customer\-to\-customer interaction in the library. Management wished to address an ongoing issue with customer behaviour and the impact that was having on both staff and other customers. A report on the findings made an initial set of recommendations to amend the customer service strategy and to develop new approaches to training \(Source A\). Further discussion led to a significant re\-orientation of the Hive’s customer service strategy \(Source B\). This had three main elements: 

-  *Recruitment:* The research identified the importance of staff being able to deal effectively with CCI situations, including tense and complex triadic situations. This led to modification of employee recruitment processes. The recruitment process now includes an interactive activity that requires applicants to engage with a user of the Hive. Greater emphasis is also placed on recruiting people who have resilience, with explicit interview questions that probe for evidence of resilience. 

-  *Incident management:* The research demonstrated that a significant proportion of incidents in the Hive were a product of CCI. This led to the development of a new approach to how staff managed behaviours \(Sources C and D\). This included improvements to the way in which incidents were logged so that characteristics of incidents could be noted and used to help determine training priorities \(Source A\). 

-  *Training:*  The Hive has redesigned and rebranded its customer service training \(Sources D and E\). The new training approach has a strong focus on preventing negative CCI. It was recognised that there was a need for the early detection of situations which might negatively impact other customers. This involves awareness of what is happening and its wider impact on those in the environment. At the heart of the new training are regular training sessions, held several times a year, for all staff where real scenarios form the basis of discussion about how to handle situations. The training is customised with the selection of incidents used being tailored to the trainees from different sections of The Hive \(e.g. library, housing, archives\). Empowering Hive staff to handle CCI enables many potentially negative situations to be de\-escalated before they become serious or for firm interventions to be made rapidly. The training has been attended by all Hive staff who have customer contact. In the region of 50 staff undergo this training at least twice a year. 

 The re\-orientation of the Hive’s customer service strategy has had the following specific benefits: 

1.  Employees have a better understanding of the range of interactions occurring between customers at The Hive \(Source F\) 

1.  Employees have a better understanding of when and how to intervene in negative CCI situations \(Source D\) 

1.  Employees experience less stress when handling difficult CCI situations \(Source F\) 

1.  Customers at The Hive enjoy a better customer experience and encounter a more consistent employee handing of CCI situations \(Sources A and D\) 

 The impact of the research has extended to several other libraries in the region. An event, partly designed to showcase the new approach to managing customer service at The Hive, was held on 23<sup>rd</sup> November 2018 in Worcester \(Source G\). This one\-day workshop, which was organised under the auspices of Mercian Collaboration Staff Development Group, a professional network of SCONUL higher education libraries in the East and West Midlands, addressed the issue of managing challenging and unorthodox behaviour in academic library environments and was attended by around 20 professional participants responsible for delivering training in libraries, including University of Coventry, Warwick University, and Birmingham City University.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 One in four birth mothers who have a child taken into care in England will re\-appear in further care proceedings within seven years. Our research in ‘recurrent care’ comprised theoretical innovation and the development of evaluation methodology. Impacts claimed are: 

1.  Establishing the field of Recurrent Care Proceedings \(RCP\) research and influencing national policy, practice and thinking; 

1.  Improvements in recurrent care services across the UK through the development of an enhanced theoretical and clinical understanding of, and ability to, meet birth parents’ previously unmet needs and through establishing a Community of Practice. 

 Essex evaluation methods based on this research have enabled services in the East of England, London, North West and Midlands to demonstrate significant initial one\-off savings plus recurring annual savings, enabling them to secure new or ongoing commissioning. Estimated savings per service range from GBP211,000 \- GBP1,000,000 from care costs that have been avoided. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 One in four birth mothers who have a child taken into care in England will re\-appear in care proceedings within seven years. Women in this situation have experienced structural disadvantage in multiple domains including socio\-economic deprivation, histories of trauma and abuse, low educational attainment and lack of access to healthcare \[R1, R2\]. Owing to the stigma of having a child removed, the phenomenon of ‘recurrent care proceedings’ \(RCP\) was previously unacknowledged. Following a scoping study by Essex for the Suffolk Family Justice Council to determine the scale of local RCP, this ‘national problem with no name…and no data’ \[R1\] was identified and influenced a new field of national collaborative research on RCP. Essex research has comprised multidisciplinary theoretical work, with a sociological base and focus, to inform local and national service development, and the development of evaluation methodology. 

 Essex academics drew on their sociological, clinical and theoretical research in trauma\-informed, attachment, and relationship\-based approaches to support new and emerging recurrent care services in developing their intervention models \[R3, R4\]. Women in RCP services have very high levels of past trauma including iatrogenic trauma from interactions with services and professionals. Our research emphasises that professionals need to acknowledge past trauma, formulate client behaviour in this context, and attempt to build positive trusting relationships to avoid further iatrogenic harm \[R3, R4\]. Our research also emphasises the need for services to enquire sensitively about past trauma, prioritise transparency in communications, develop collaborative relationships, adopt strengths\-based approaches and work in partnership with survivors \[R3, R4\]. Our work has been iterative in being both generated and applied through service development work with RCP services. 

 In addition to supporting service development, Essex research has supported RCP service evaluation. Development of a tailored evaluation methodology by Essex began with the design and conduct of a mixed\-methods evaluation of one of the first RCP services in England \(Suffolk\), established to support mothers who had had a child removed, and to reduce recurrent care proceedings. This pilot service was established within a local authority \(LA\) setting with limited funding.  Ongoing funding was precarious because the mothers concerned tended to be maligned and seen as ‘undeserving’ of further support. Skeletal staff teams had limited resources and no capacity for evaluation. Keyworkers were conscious that their clients were in need of health and wellbeing services and had experienced structural inequalities and significant disadvantage. The evaluation methodology developed by Essex led to the first two published evaluation reports \[R2, R5\] of UK recurrent care services, the latter featuring in a Special Issue of *Societies* on RCP, guest edited by Cox, McPherson and Blumenfeld. These helped to reframe perceptions of clients \(e.g. by documenting histories of trauma and disadvantage\) within the wider commissioning community and to demonstrate cost benefits of such services arising from avoiding care proceedings and avoided ongoing care costs \[R2\]. 

 The publication and dissemination of the first report \[R2\] began a process of research and impact developing iteratively, as new services emerged and sought out the Essex team to support service development and evaluation \(see section 4\). The evaluation methodology was developed through this iterative process in which each evaluation carried out by the Essex team led to new enhancements, adaptations and improved knowledge of both clinical needs and how to apply evaluation methods in these contexts.  Essex were commissioned over the period 2012\-2020 to undertake independent evaluations of RCP and edge\-of\-care services in Suffolk, Norfolk, Stockport, Merseyside, Croydon, Birmingham, Southend and Salford \[R2, R6, R7, R5\]. 

 Part way through this period, an open\-access evaluation toolkit \[R8\] was commissioned by Research in Practice \(RiP; a partnership championing evidence informed practices in children’s services\) and published as an output of our methodological research. Early draft versions of the toolkit shared with the RiP community led to, and was applied to, the Essex research team’s evaluations in Stockport, Merseyside and Salford \[R7\]. The toolkit was informed by findings from the Essex team’s ongoing theoretical and methodological insights \[R3, R4\] as well as service development work in RCP services \[R7\]. Specifically, the methodology systematically documented key features of clients’ backgrounds including socio\-demographics, trauma histories and healthcare needs \[R2, R6\]. Robust psychometric measures were selected which would document the level of mental health care need, and these have routinely indicated significant complex clinical need in all services evaluated \[R7, R5\]. Qualitative interviews were designed to capture birth parents’ experiences in more depth. Drawing particularly on theoretical insights \[R3, R4\]. The methodology was developed to take into account the nature of professional working in social care, the centrality of professional\-client relationship building in this setting, and how the precariousness of trust in these initial stages impacts on the timing, nature and robustness of data collection.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Establishing the field and influencing national thinking** 

 Following Cox’s seminal piece \[R1\] setting out the ‘national problem with no name’, Cox was commissioned to undertake the first RCP service evaluation \(Suffolk\) \[R7\] which was published in a peer review journal \[R2\]. This was then featured in the Ministry of Justice’s 2017 Family Justice Bulletin which reached 400 experts including judges, LA leads, professional bodies and frontline social work leads \[S1 p34\]. The Ministry of Justice commented in 2017, “ *the key findings are that at least in the short\-term repeat pregnancies are avoided for those women taking part and any resulting care proceedings resulting in savings. …The findings can be used to influence government decision making and hopefully encourage projects that work intensively with women and men after losing children*” \[S2\].  Based on her work and her role in helping to establish the national RCP research field, Cox was invited to join the evaluation advisory board of PAUSE, a national RCP project supported by the Department for Education, initially rolled out in London and later via 21 hubs in England and Wales. She was also invited to take part in a subsequent Research in Practice \(RiP\) change project: 

 *“We invited Essex to be key partners in this project because of their expertise in evaluation methodologies in this specialist and emerging field. It was particularly important for services to be able to develop proportionate, meaningful evaluation approaches which Essex was expert in developing.  We understood Essex to be the experts in this field and essential for the project based on Prof Pam Cox’s role in establishing the field following the Family Justice Council 6<sup>th</sup> annual debate in 2012 on the topic; the ensuing seminal paper \(Cox, 2012\) which established the field in the literature; and the Essex team publication of their first evaluation of the Suffolk recurrent care service in a peer reviewed journal \(Cox et al, 2017\). Prof Cox also sits on the advisory board for PAUSE, the first nationally commissioned recurrent care service in order to advise on evaluation methods and as such was a recognised leader in the field specifically in terms of evaluation methodologies.”* Assistant Director, Research in Practice \[S3\]. 

 The Essex research team has subsequently been seen as the expert hub for evaluation methodology for new services in this field and took part in the RiP ‘Change Project’ \(2017\-2018\) the evaluation lead \[S3\]. This involved 11 English LAs seeking to establish or extend recurrent/edge\-of\-care services. RiP is a collaborative initiative supported by the Association of Directors of Children’s Services and has 105 English LA members. RiP commissioned the Essex toolkit \[R8\] as part of an interactive online resource pack for RCP services \[S4\]. The pack included a section on ‘Setting up a service – evaluation and cost benefits’ \[S4 p23\-30\] featuring resources prepared by Essex on evaluation methods \[S4 p23\] and research findings from Suffolk and Norfolk evaluations \[S4 p.24\]. The resource pack also includes films and tutorials delivered by Taggart \[S4 p31\-32\]. Essex has developed key insights into good practice approaches, specifically in terms of trauma\-informed, attachment and relationship\-based approaches applied to social care settings \[R3, R4\]. These insights were harnessed as part of the RiP ‘Change Project’, for which Taggart was commissioned to record four webinars, a blog and a Frontline Briefing on using attachment, trauma\-informed and relationship\-based approaches in social care aimed at social care practitioners. Overall, this resource pack extended the reach of Essex methodological and theoretical research beyond the initial Change Project to all services engaging with RiP with page views of the resource pack totalling 5606 as of February 2020 \[S3\]. The resource was also available as a complete pdf downloadable resource \(with 654 downloads as of Feb 2020 \[S3\]\). 

 **Improvements in recurrent care services across the UK through the development of an enhanced theoretical and clinical understanding of, and ability to meet, birth parents’ previously unmet needs and through establishing a Community of Practice** 

 Parents who lose child\(ren\) to care have experienced multiple disadvantages and structural inequalities and experience further complex challenges in the months and years following removal. Court judgements routinely recommend therapeutic input for parents, yet this is rarely available partly owing to costs and stigma. RCP services lack funding for specialist therapeutic input. The RiP Resource pack \[S4 \- section 3\] translated Essex research into accessible training materials for frontline social care professionals on using attachment, trauma\-informed and relationship\-based approaches in social care. This translation and dissemination via RiP enabled Essex theoretical work to impact on service development across the UK, enhancing the reach of trauma\-informed therapeutic practices applied in social care settings: 

 *“Danny Taggart’s publication and supporting webinar have been warmly received by our network Partners with 2277 downloads of Dr Taggart’s frontline briefing and webinar views of 1682 up to February 2020. These have contributed to a nuanced, client centred knowledge development in relation to trauma informed practice.” \[S3\]* 

 Testimonials from four LAs also attest to Essex’s influence on their service development \[S5, S6, S7, S8\]. For example, Stockport’s RCP service lead commented that “ *applying attachment theory to help us to think about difficulties in the parent/worker relationship has given us a framework to begin to understand behaviours that appear to be counterproductive, such as avoidance, or hostility. We have then been able to adapt our responses to try and repair or reach a woman for example, by offering comfort or validation when a woman falls into her attachment response of withdrawal as a way to manage her fear.*” \[S5\] 

 Essex research has enabled parents to benefit from therapeutic approaches previously unavailable and unaffordable, by enabling more services to make their case to exist and through enabling therapeutic enhancement of these services.  Across the 8 services that Essex has directly evaluated, at least 400 birth mothers and fathers were engaged during the evaluation periods and therefore have benefitted from increased access to health care and therapeutic support \[R4\]. 

 Following on from the RiP Change Project, a collaboration was formed between RiP, Lancaster, Essex and PAUSE which received investment of GBP100,000 from Public Health England in 2020 to build and pilot a national Community of Practice \(CoP\) for LA and voluntary sector agencies \[S9\]. The CoP development, which had to adapt in light of COVID\-19 UK lockdown, currently has 84 member organisations including Barnardo’s, Ormiston Families and many Local Authorities. During 2020, staff within these organisations have been engaging in a range of webinars and other online events focused on trauma\-informed responses to the reproductive health needs of birth parents at risk of RCP, drawing on Essex research. The CoP online learning repository is currently in development with a launch and conference event planned for March 2021. Cox and Taggart continue to input into CoP events on trauma\-informed approaches and service evaluation approaches. Cox and McPherson are currently leading an evaluation of the CoP \[S9\]. 

 **Essex evaluation methods have enabled services in the East of England, London, North West and Midlands to demonstrate significant initial one\-off savings plus recurring annual savings, enabling them to secure new or ongoing commissioning. Estimated savings per service range from GBP211,000\- GBP1,000,000 from care costs that have been avoided.** 

 Eight services have commissioned Essex evaluations and/or service development projects, enabling them to assess their cost and clinical effectiveness and develop their service. The evaluation reports \[R7\] have enabled services to negotiate ongoing funding through the claim that psychological need is high and that RCP services can enable mothers to take steps towards better wellbeing such as registering with a GP and beginning to disclose and address alcohol, drug and domestic violence issues and thus initiate referrals to other services \[S5, S7\]. 

 In our evaluation approach, we calculated one\-off cost savings for each service over a fixed period by calculating the number of care proceedings that had been avoided \(avoided costs include associated costs such as court fees and legal aid\). We also calculated an ongoing annual savings figure attributable to avoided care costs based on the 2017 Department for Education published report on PAUSE which estimated the cost of avoided care arrangements at GBP52,676 per child per year which is cumulative until a child reaches the age of 18. Building this approach into our evaluation reports \[R7\] enabled services to make a case for ongoing commissioning as noted in testimonials from Stockport, Merseyside and Suffolk RCPs \[S5, S6, S7\]. One\-off savings within the evaluation periods were GBP97,000 \(Stockport\) \[S5\], GBP256,000 \(Merseyside\) \[S7\] and GBP450,000 Suffolk \[S6\]. Ongoing yearly savings were estimated as GBP211,000 \(Stockport\) \[S5\], GBP895,000 \(Merseyside\) \[S7\] and GBP1,000,000 \(Suffolk\) \[S6\]. 

 Cost savings estimates are conservative in that although they have to be offset against the cost of running the service, they do not include potential further savings from reduced alcohol, drug use or domestic violence or the avoidance of children after the age of 18 finding themselves in the category ‘Not in Education or Employment’ \(NEET\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Roma pupils and their families face persistent social and educational disadvantages and exclusion across Europe. This research led to an improved education for Roma pupils leading to significant improvements in attendance and achievement. This was achieved through changes to teachers’ understanding of Roma languages and heritage, which supported a critical unlearning of tenacious prejudice towards Roma. Parents’ involvement as co\-participants in the research was emancipatory. It transformed their self\-perception as language experts, leading to new ways of working with schools, thereby benefitting their children’s learning. Tools emanating from the research project have impacted on educational professionals’ attitudes and practices for inclusion of Roma pupils across Europe, including in the prevention of harmful discrimination.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research by Heather Smith \(HS\) on the teaching of anti\-racist pedagogical approaches and linguistic inclusion in the preparation of teachers over the last 15 years has led to insights into the most effective practices in overcoming teacher prejudices within a framework of white supremacy and structural racism \[PUBS1, 2 and 3\]. Previous research led to conceptual advancement of inclusive and developmental pedagogies for pupils who live and learn in more than one language \[PUB4\]. Research expertise in multilingual teacher education was also provided by Leena Robertson \(project Co\-PI\) from Middlesex University. Partners in France, led by Nathalie Auger and in Finland, led by Fred Dervin provided expertise in intercultural education. The research team also worked closely with Nicu Gal, founder of the People to People foundation in Romania. 

 ROMtels \(Roma Translanguaging Enquiry Learning Space: G1\) was led by HS as PI and supported by an award from the competitive Erasmus\+ European strategic partnerships scheme. Translanguaging is both a theory of language in use and, of concern here, a pedagogical practice which enables pupils to draw on any \(or all\) of their languages in the pursuit of learning in order to most effectively advance that learning: translanguaging\-to\-learn. The initial project took place in England, France, Romania and Finland, beginning in 2 primary schools in Newcastle \(90 staff members altogether and approximately 1,200 mostly bilingual pupils\). This was followed by work in a middle and primary school in Sète, France, a primary school in Järvenpää, Finland and a pro\-Roma school in Tinca \(a small village outside the town of Oradea, Romania\), for Roma pupils who are not accepted into most state schools. Because of differences in how ethnicity is captured across Europe and the tendency for some families not to self\-identify as Roma to avoid discrimination, it was not possible to definitively calculate the number of Roma children in the researched schools, but in School 1 in Newcastle, where the research team were more confident of the figures, in 2015/16, 108/658 \(16.53%\) of pupils in the school were identified as Roma, and in 2016/2017, that figure had increased to 124/703 \(17.63%\). 

 The ROMtels research corroborated evidence primarily from North America that translanguaging can be an inclusive pedagogy which supports multilingual pupils’ learning \[PUB5, Imp3\]. ROMtels is unique, however, in its working to adapt translanguaging to the specific and urgent need to improve Roma education, and in using technology to support translanguaging\-to\-learn in Romani dialects with no official name and no standardised written form \[PUB6\]. The collaborative approach to working with parents and teachers adopted in the project, which the team termed a “languages for dignity” approach, required parents to become involved in the production of *prestigious* pedagogical resources, drawing on their funds of knowledge in translanguaging. It required teachers to understand this parental capital and collaborate in combining it with their pedagogical capital to produce meaningful, longstanding, reciprocal and trusting relationships in the co\-production of classroom resources which support *all* children’s learning. The project produced high quality and, in England, high status innovative technological resources for translanguaging\-to\-learn in curriculum subjects such as art, history and science. When pupils translanguage\-to\-learn, they become identified by fellow pupils and their teachers as plurilingual. In turn, this can impact on their self\-construction as expert learners and in pride in *all* of their languages. 

 From this original research, the project extrapolated a lucid practice model of: successful approaches to a translanguaging pedagogy for contexts across Europe; and a “languages for dignity” approach for inclusive practices in schools and other institutions, which highlights the inappropriate nature of schools’ often simplistic language surveys for engaging with communities such as Roma. To share the research findings and tools developed, 3 handbooks were written \(in English, French, Finnish, Romanian and now Spanish\), with an accompanying series of videos for teacher training; 19 conference presentations; 5 technology guides; software package for digital tools and apps with 2 configuration wizards; and digital packages of material and videos for 4 enquiries. All of this is freely downloadable from the project website \( [https://research.ncl.ac.uk/romtels](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/romtels)\).The research has also developed a cutting\-edge conceptual model of translanguaging as a learning process \[Pub 5\]. Reflections on the project led to wider understandings of Romani language use and the need for careful use of translanguaging for those communities living in the most vulnerable circumstances \[Pub 6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This research has demonstrated impact of substantive transformative significance on pupils, parents and schools, improving the learning outcomes and attendance for Roma pupils, vastly improved relations between families and schools, and positive changes in teacher attitudes towards Roma communities. Its international reach beyond the original project to teachers, schools and teacher educators, \[text removed for publication\] and an Advisor for Inclusive Practice with the Valencian Autonomous Government in Spain, has influenced and shaped policies and practices in Roma education and translanguaging. This led to ROMtels being shortlisted in the Times Higher Education Awards 2020 as Research Project of the Year \(Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences\). 

 6,781 users have visited the ROMtels website since it launched in July 2015. These users made a total of 8,939 visits to the overall website, with a total of 23,343 individual webpage views, coming from at least 114 countries with the UK, US, France and China being the top 4 locations. The website now appears as links in websites of professional organisations; for example, ACERT \(Advisory Council for the Education of Romany and other Travellers\); EAL research email list, Newcastle City Council Services to Schools, and in the European Commission school education gateway \[Imp1\]. It is listed too in the Roma support group website \[Imp1\]. It also features prominently on a blog on translanguaging by Dr Anna Mendoza, Hong Kong University \[Imp1\]. 

 **Impact on pupils: improved learning experience, attendance and achievement** 

 Impact on pupils’ learning and attendance during the original project was substantial. The video recordings of pupils in Newcastle and Sète \[Imp3a\] demonstrate pupils translanguaging\-to\-learn during joint problem solving to; reason, speculate, justify, clarify, convince, recount/recall and support peers. Pupils in France reported feeling safe and accepted by teachers, and pupils across the project spoke of their pride in speaking Romani \[Imp2\]. In one of the videos from Newcastle \[Imp3b\] a Roma pupil hearing her language in the enquiry space for the first time, can be heard saying, “Miss that’s my English\! I know that language\!” thereby publicly naming her language in the only way she knew how, delighted that she was able to do so. 

 In terms of attendance, Headteachers reported improvements in Newcastle, Sète and Tinca \[Imp2\] for the Roma pupils involved in the original project. For example, in Newcastle, Eastern European pupils’ attendance rose from an average of 21.4% at or above the national average in 2014/15 to 44.7% in 2016/17 \(note figures are given for Eastern European pupils rather than Roma as many parents in the school at the time did not acknowledge their Roma heritage as signalled in section 2\). These results are especially important given that Roma pupils consistently underachieve in terms of education outcomes in comparison to other groups across Europe. They also face significant exclusion sometimes as a result of non\-attendance at school. In the UK, Roma boys face the highest rate of permanent school exclusion. 

 In terms of attainment, the Executive Headteacher in Newcastle reported improved pupil attainment and remarkable improvements in phonics screening tests for years 1 and 2 \[Imp2\]; for example, in 2014 no Eastern European \(EE\) children completing the screening check in Y2 \(either for the first time or as a re\-sit\) met the required standard. By 2016, 81.3% of EE children met the required standard, which the Head ascribed to working with the project \[Imp2\]. There is recent evidence that these phonics screening tests can lead to teachers grouping pupils in key stage 1 by phase of phonics learning, which could lead to further exclusionary practices, hence demonstrating the value of such improvements as security against further exclusionary practices for Roma. In Romania, teacher assessments showed an average 20% increase in subject knowledge acquired for each class by age over the whole school \(according to class tests\) from 2015/16 to 2016/17 \[Imp2\]. 

 Bowling Park Primary School in Bradford \(once named the worst primary school in England as it spent 5 years as a school graded by Ofsted as requiring improvement\) started to use the project resources and in particular the handbooks in 2018 to change their practice with multilingual pupils including Roma. Specifically, they introduced a translanguaging pedagogy in which they reported developing “a language rich classroom where children are encouraged to combine home languages and English to allow for deeper, more meaningful learning experiences”. Increases in children’s achievement in just one year have been staggering \[Imp5\]: year 1 phonics scores \(for the whole school, not just multilingual pupils\) increased from 68% at age\-related expectation \(ARE\) in 2017/2018 to 82% in 2018/2019. The year 6 SATs results for Eastern European pupils including Roma at ARE in 2017/2018 were 59% with an increase to 67% ARE in 2018/2019, which is outstanding considering nationally only 17% of Roma children achieved a combined ARE in the year 6 SATS last year. 

 **Impact on Parents: transformed school relations** 

 Over the course of the research, the impact on parents and their relationship to and understandings of schooling has been transformative. Parents’ self\-perception alongside schools’ perceptions of the parents and pupils changed from one of deficit to expertise \[Pub 6\]. Relationships changed. By the time the Translanguaging Enquiry Space \(a multilingual virtual\-reality\-like real space: see Imp3a\) opened to the local Roma families in a Newcastle school, 42 parents attended some with their pre\-school infants, from all different Roma backgrounds. One of the parents who participated in translating and recording character voices in Roma \[Imp3g\] became so involved that she presented at the conference for teachers in Newcastle \[Imp3c\], *and* at the dissemination event in London \[Imp3d\]. This mother describes in a video on the project website how she was almost beaten to death as a teenager for attending a mainstream school in Slovak Republic \[Imp3e\]. The Executive Headteacher of the Newcastle Schools \[Imp2\] reported “the trust and confidence of this parent group demonstrated towards both federation schools has been steadily improving”. His report also shows Roma parents’ increased participation \(sometimes in Slovak or Romanian and/or Romani\) in Tapestry \(online learning journal that provides on\-going formative assessment evidence\) from 52% in 2015/216 to 68% one year later. Videos of parents in France working in school alongside teachers, researchers and pupils further demonstrate transformed relations despite the length of time it takes them to reach the school given that they lived in a squat on the edge of town, far from even a bus stop, making school attendance extremely difficult \[Imp3f\].  In Romania, parents of the Roma children in the pro\-Roma school in Tinca village, who live in conditions akin to developing nations in the global south, volunteered to become classroom assistants in the early years and the school reported an increase of 20% in the number of parents attending home school meetings \[Imp2\]. This research strongly refutes the normalised representation in education of Roma parents as disinterested in their children’s education and as ‘hard to reach’. Maintained relationships with the Roma parents in Newcastle has recently resulted in 30 parents and children from across the local Slovak, Czech and Romanian Roma communities visiting the University to learn about university education \[Imp3h\]. 

 **Impact on Teachers/Schools: changed attitudes and practices** 

 The Executive Headteacher of the 2 Newcastle schools acknowledged the effect upon his staff of participation in the ROMtels research in terms of raising awareness of challenges faced by Roma communities and opportunities for improved practice \[Imp2\]. 

 Delegates at the dissemination event in London \(45 attendees, 34 of whom provided feedback, 100% positive\) \[Imp7\], provided extraordinarily positive feedback demonstrating changed attitudes and ideas for transformed practices including shaping future projects by amending negative language; sharing and informing practices from school to local authority levels, and sharing in the development of a Roma Organisation in Scotland. 

 Following their use of the project resources, the lead teacher of EAL in Bowling Park in Bradford reports that “our approach to teaching all new to English children has changed quite dramatically over the past year with a much greater emphasis on valuing home language. New arrivals are now taught using translanguaging – usually English/ Slovak, English/ Czech, English/ Polish. This has had an excellent impact on learning as the children feel confident to share ideas with the home language speaking teacher whist continuing to acquire new language.” \[Imp5\] 

 In Romania, feedback provided at the 2 day teacher conference in Oradea \(70 attendees, over 90% of whom provided feedback, all of which demonstrated transformed understandings\) demonstrated cognitive and emotional disruption of teachers’ prejudiced views of Roma and their improved knowledge of translanguaging as an inclusive pedagogy \[Imp6\]. Responses included, for example: “be a voice against discrimination”; “a factor of changing and recovering of the lost potential”; and “the change is within us”. Discussions about what they would now do included comments such as: “explain to our colleagues why it is important to have knowledge about the Roma traditions and language”; “to encourage them to use their language and not to be ashamed of who they are”. After the project conference in Romania, 18 teachers registered to learn Romani at the local university, unheard of for non\-Roma in Romania. In a follow\-up email to 39 of the 70 attendees 15 responses were received showing a continued engagement with the issues previously developed \[Imp6\]. 

 **Impact on Teachers/Schools: prevention of harm** 

 \[text removed for publication\] 

 **Impact in Teacher Education and at Policy level** 

 The project resources are now in use beyond participants in the original project in training student teachers. For example, following a visit to Barcelona University in 2018 by HS, Isabel Civera found the ROMtels work influential to her own research and in her teaching of student teachers in Spain \[Imp9\]. In UK, the project handbooks and videos are now being used in teacher training, such as at Leeds Beckett University \[Imp 5\]. Following engagement in several NALDIC \(the National Subject Association for EAL\) events and publication in their journal, the research and resources are now also being used in teacher CPD \(continuing professional development\) by Sheffield City Council EAL New Arrivals Team, which in turn has led to supporting a school in Sheffield with a majority Roma school population \[Imp9\]. As the senior EMA advisor reports, they have “threaded the research findings from the ROMtels project and the resources into the majority our training which includes our year\-long EAL Champion programme for Senior/middle leaders and teachers and our similar TA EAL Specialist programme for teaching assistants. In addition, this work is included in our central CPD courses.” The advisor also reports “On a personal level, I have been inspired by Heather Smith and her work with Roma learners and their families. It has deepened my own knowledge of translanguaging and its empowering effect.” \[Imp9\] In Valencia, ROMtels handbook 3 was presented at a meeting of the Education Department \(Valencian Community Government\) as a complementary resource of the new official resources to make Roma culture more visible in schools. An educational inclusion advisor within the Valencian Government, has invited HS to support the linking of ROMtels with the production of resources and training for teachers in including Roma in Valencia, as in the Strategic Plan for the Roma population in the Inclusion and Equality Department \(Social Affairs Government\). \[Imp10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor David Edgerton’s research has changed understandings of key issues of 20th\-century British history among politicians, journalists and intellectuals. He championed the idea of British nationalism, rather than imperialism, as a key concept within public discussion around the causes of Brexit. Through radically rewriting the history of industrial strategy in Britain, he informed a cross\-party shift towards taking policy for innovation and industry seriously. By challenging national myths of the Second World War, particularly the idea that the UK was weak and alone in 1940, Edgerton not only reframed the public understanding of the conflict, but also the parallels drawn from it, notably Brexit and COVID\-19. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Edgerton’s series of ground\-breaking books has presented a concerted challenge to hackneyed tropes and well\-entrenched orthodoxies in the history of the UK during the 20th century, changing the terms of academic study as well as popular understanding of the period. 

#  Taking British nationalism seriously 

 *The Rise and Fall of the British Nation*, which to date has sold 18,000 copies, centres on a novel conceptualisation of a new British nation and nationalism after 1945 emerging out of the British empire/global economy and forged within a new national political economic framework. This contrasts with earlier approaches that see imperialism and nationalism as one and stress the continuity of imperialist delusions after 1945, leading to economic decline, racism and as explanatory causes to Brexit in the recent past. 

 *The* *Rise and Fall of the British Nation* also contains an empirical and theoretical critique of the dominant accounts of the nature of British capitalism and capitalists and relations to the British state. Far from an anti\-industrial political culture, Edgerton stresses the close links, not least in politics, between state and capital, arguing that the high point of British industrial production was in the 1950s and 1960s and that there has since been a determined move away from promoting a national capitalism. 

#  Writing in Britain’s developmental state 

 *Warfare State* and *The Rise and Fall of the British Nation* show that after the Second World War UK governments of both political parties maintained a strong military and industrial policy designed to strengthen the new post\-imperial nation, which directly complemented post\-war welfarist and social policies. His approach contrasts sharply with previous orthodoxies insisting on the centrality of the welfare state only and which portrayed industrial and innovation policy as weak and at best misdirected. Edgerton, in other words, allows us to see that the UK had a developmental state in the post\-war decades, in which politicians and bureaucrats sort to foster national industries and promote national inventions. 

#  Neither weak, nor ‘alone’ 

 *Warfare State* and *Britain’s War Machine* \(which has sold more than 17,000 copies\), in contrast to the view that British arms were weak in the inter\-war years and thus in 1939–40, show that for most of the time, the RAF and Royal Navy were in fact second to none and were supported by probably the largest military\-industrial\-scientific complex in the world. 

 *Britain’s War Machine* shows that during the Second World War the UK and the British empire relied on capital intensive forces, much more so than Germany. Furthermore, the nation was not alone, nor believed to be alone \(as modern historiography suggests\), but was part of an empire, always had allies and also depended on massive overseas supply. All this represents a major revision of older and recent works on the war. The book was widely reviewed in the national press \(and was lead review in *The Observer*\), was shortlisted for the Hessell\-Tiltman History Prize and was a *Guardian* Book of the Year. 

 As the academic reviews noted, all these works rely on extensive primary research to make radically new arguments about 20th\-century British history, including the public\-facing works.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Following the 2016 Brexit referendum, there was a dramatic transformation in the public life of the UK. For some, it involved much heart\-searching about the true nature of Britain and British history, while for others it was a moment to celebrate and replay the Second World War. For many politicians it was a time to rethink British policy, not least industrial and innovation policy. In these contexts, reshaping understandings of history, understood to be of central political relevance, had a material impact. Edgerton’s work made people think in new ways. This impact was achieved through writing books for the general public \[2,3\] and drawing directly on the books, multiple articles for the press, speaking at government and other events, and many appearances on TV and radio \[D\]. His books became necessary reading for many in public life on both the left and the right. The *New Statesman* said of *The Rise and Fall of the British Nation* that: “Every so often a book comes out that the entire political class needs to read”. *The Rise and Fall* was noted as a feature of the literary year 2018 by *Whitaker’s Almanac* and was a book of the year in *Prospect, History Today* and the *New Statesman* \[A\]. It was reviewed in nearly all the national press and most of the major weeklies, often as a lead review. 

 The impact revolved around three themes: \(i\) putting the idea of British nationalism, rather than imperialism, and the decay of a British national capitalism into the discussion on Brexit; \(ii\) creating a new account of national policy for innovation and industry, which helped to reinvigorate the contemporary desire for a coherent industrial strategy; and \(iii\) undermining key myths of the Second World War that Britain was alone and weak in 1940 and, in turn, rethinking what many consider to be its contemporary analogues, Brexit and COVID\-19. 

#  Putting nationalism and the national economy into the Brexit debate 

 Edgerton transformed the public debate on Brexit by framing its causes in terms of British nationalism and the demise of the national economy. The standard view, among many historians and among the largely Remain\-backing commentariat, was that the Brexit vote was, like the failure to enter the EEC in the 1950s, a product of an underlying British imperialism. This was one of the many ways British history was linked to Brexit. *The Rise and Fall of the British Nation* was a powerful force in changing minds and in introducing new elements into the debate. The intervention was two\-fold. First, the importance of post\-war nationalism, rather than imperialism, in shaping the politics of Brexit: that Brexit was a longing for a national politics and a national economy that had been central to Britain in the 1960s and 1970s. The second was his argument that the old British national capitalism had given way to a strong non\-British capitalism in the UK, which necessarily had very different connections to the Conservative Party. This helped explain the mystery of why the Conservative government was pursuing a Brexit policy that business in Britain did not support and why business was so acquiescent. 

 It was clear from commentary on the book and related work that Edgerton had taken a distinctive and politically significant view on Brexit that gave him a pathway to impact. Opinion formers took note of *The Rise and Fall* and Edgerton was invited to contribute op\-ed pieces of major reach. He was commissioned to write five *Guardian* articles, while the *New Statesman* commissioned a cover story on the transformation of British capitalism and a long read on the historical politics of British trade. The distinctiveness and significance of the arguments led him to be invited onto Radio 4’s *Today* programme \(reaching around 5 million listeners\) to discuss his book on the first anniversary of the Brexit vote. He was often paired with the most important pro\-Brexit historians: for example, with Robert Tombs on the BBC World Service and on *Newsnight,* and with the Thatcher biographer and former editor of the *Telegraph* and *Spectator* Charles Moore on a *Channel Four News* podcast. In a truncated online clip, this had 364,000 views and 4,000 retweets on Twitter, with thousands of reactions, comments and shares on Facebook, and led to stories on it in the *New European* on the *Independent* website \[B,D\]. 

 Edgerton’s argument that one needed to take account of a deep but unrecognised non\-imperial British nationalism in Brexit became part of a national discussion. As one comment on Twitter put it: “Are you sure that Brexiters are longing for the Empire, rather than the pre\-Thatcher British nation which David Edgerton’s book is about?” \[D\]. The *New Statesman* recognised how *The Rise and Fall of the British Nation*: “challenges many of the fundamental preconceptions of Brexiteers and Remainers alike”. In the *Economist*, a dedicated column hailed its call to rethink what “we thought we knew about British national character” \[A\]. For other people, it helped make sense of the politics of Brexit: a socialist activist \(with 120,000 followers on Twitter\) noted: “I’m struck how coalitions, shifting party loyalties, constitutional skirmishes and multiple nationalisms are the historical norm for British politics – not some terrifying modern malfunction” \[D\]. 

 The idea of an imperial origin of Brexit, that the empire was striking back, was also strong in the policy world in Brussels and Edgerton’s book had a role in changing that. Dr Eoin Drea, Senior Research Officer at the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies in Brussels \(the official think tank of the European Peoples’ Party \(Christian Democrats\)\), organised a panel with Edgerton in June 2019 attended by around 100 EU officials and others concerned with EU policy to discuss the empire strikes back thesis and his critique. Dr Drea noted in his opening remarks: “The Rise and Fall of the British Nation: \[is\] the inspiration for this event” \[F\]. 

 Edgerton’s work on the specific nature of British capitalism also altered the terms of the Brexit debate. One article in *The* *Guardian* on this theme garnered a quite exceptional 4,430 comments, 4,171 social media posts and at least 500 discrete tweets. The noted French intellectual Bruno Latour \(26,000 followers\) tweeted in response: “If you despair of understanding Brexit, David Edgerton’s piece is most remarkable in the link between forms of capitalism, influence on party politics, and the problem of who defends national interests” \[D\]. More generally, the claims about Brexit being driven by a Conservative Party no longer tied to a national capitalism were seized on by foreign journalists who found Brexit otherwise inexplicable. The argument was picked up very strongly by business and economic journalists, both in Britain and aboard, who wished to explain to their business readers the strange politics of Brexit \[A\]. 

#  The policy implications of Britain’s developmental state 

 The standard view of post\-war industrial and innovation policy was that it was weakly developed and was a failure. In revising the standard account of post\-war policy \[1,3\], Edgerton argued that the British record in industrial policy after 1945 was one of serious policy activism and ambition, and one in which the state spent a great deal on R&D and achieving some success. This argument gave courage to advocates of fresh policy initiatives across the political spectrum, from Policy Exchange on the right and the Institute of Public Policy Research on the left, and in the government and in the opposition. The issue gained new salience after the Brexit referendum as some politicians in the Conservative Party sought to develop a more national policy for innovation and industry under Theresa May, and also in the post\-Brexit Labour party. 

 Edgerton’s work on the history of industrial and innovation policy changed the view of policymakers and politicians. Tony Curzon Price, Economic Advisor to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy between 2016 and 2019, cited Edgerton’s work extensively in briefs for his minister on industrial strategy, innovation policy, consumer protection and regulation for innovation; decisions on nuclear power, energy policy and decarbonisation; and increase in state R&D. Curzon Price noted that “David Edgerton’s Rise and Fall of the British Nation had a material impact in all of these policy areas” because it changed minds about the success and nature of industrial strategy of the past. The impact of Edgerton’s ideas at senior levels in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) may also be judged from the fact that he was invited to address more than 100 civil servants at BEIS \[G\]. 

 In the Labour party too, there was new interest in national economics and industrial policy, which was sharpened and made more confident as a result of Edgerton’s research. The Rt Hon Rachel Reeves MP, the former chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee, said: *“*David’s history provides an important historical guide in helping us think about how in future we can develop a Labour political economy” \[E\]. She also cited his arguments in a contribution to a Fabian Society book, *Beyond Brexit: The Left’s Agenda for the UK and EU* \(edited by Olivia Bailey, with a foreword by Sir Keir Starmer, 2018\). Edgerton has also become a regular participant in Labour Party policy seminars run by Rachel Reeves and attended by other members of the Shadow Cabinet. 

#  Never ‘alone’ and always strong 

 The standard popular argument in academic histories, on television and in popular histories of the Second World War was that in 1940 the UK was not only weak militarily and industrially, but also found itself alone and turned inward to find strength. This argument has been central in the political uses of histories of the war not least in the context of Brexit and COVID\-19. Edgerton’s argument that it was neither weak nor alone in *Britain’s War Machine*, that it was relatively strong and had many allies, as well as being *part* of the British empire and dependent on the rest of the world, challenged the core of the standard story. He contributed to the *New Statesman* on the meaning of VE Day, which provoked a Twitter storm \(1,400 retweets, 101 quoted tweets and 7,400 likes\) and generated an article in the *Daily Express* \[D\] *.* 

 The impact of these arguments was evidenced in a slew of books and programmes of very wide reach that took up his arguments explicitly, and in others where the older arguments were quietly dropped. For example, James Holland’s bestselling *War in the West* takes up Edgerton’s non\-declinist position. As he put it on Twitter \(to his 37,000 followers\), Edgerton “had a huge impact on my own studies into \#WWII & done much to kick the declinist view into touch” \[D\]. A BBC Radio 4 series on the economic history of 1940 gave pride of place to Edgerton’s arguments in its discussion of the UK. Similarly, his fresh account of the British case represented the UK in a VoxEU collection on the economics of the war for economists \(and was cited in the *Sunday Times\).* 

 Edgerton was also invited to present the British story from his point of view in many documentaries, including an outstanding ABC Australia series on the Second World War and the *War Factory* series \(2019\). The extent of the transformation can be gauged from an episode of the very popular Second World War podcast We Have Ways of Making You Talk *\(*Al Murray and James Holland\), which reflected on the ways Edgerton has changed understanding of the war \[C\]. As someone put it on Twitter, “Britain’s War Machine … will change your view of the war and Britain’s place in it forever” \[D\]. 

 His specific arguments about the war – that the nation was well\-prepared in advance and that the war involved extensive connections to the rest of the world – were also taken up as a distinct challenge to the view that there were good analogies between the war and COVID\-19 and which led to more responsible thinking about policy during the pandemic. His picture of the Second World War was also important in rejecting analogies between the war and the COVID\-19 crisis. One contribution was noted by John Naughton in the *Observer* as “a bracing post by historian David Edgerton on his terrific blog”. His view that the wartime analogies were false and dangerous helped reduce the prevalence of the argument and was widely adopted. A *Guardian* article on this was shared on social media 1,700 times. He was invited to contribute on this theme to the *New Statesman* and the *New European* and Evan Davis’s BBC Radio 4 *Bottom Line* business programme \(28 May 2020\) to elucidate comparisons between the Second World War and COVID\-19, as well as for the VoxTalk podcast for economists \[A,B\]. He was also quoted in a *Spears Magazine* cover story, a *Financial Times* long read and in *Fortune* and *Forbes* to support the argument that the wartime analogy was highly misleading \[A\]. The cumulative impact of these interventions among politicians, journalists and public intellectuals has been a definitive refashioning of key issues of 20th\-century British history and the implications of such frameworks for understanding Brexit Britain.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by EaStCHEM Professor Colin Pulham has solved long\-standing stability issues associated with phase\-change materials \(PCMs\) based on salt hydrates, making possible the development of new formulations that efficiently store and reproducibly release heat on demand. With these new patented formulations at their core, UK\-based *Sunamp Ltd* have brought to market the world’s first commercially viable residential heat batteries. 

 *Sunamp* has created 52 jobs \(headcount: 52; FTEs: 50\), raised investment of GBP12,000,000, and generated total revenue of GBP10,000,000 between 1 August 2013 and 31 December 2020. From the early *SunampPV* model, deployed in large UK trials from 2015 \(1,000 installed\), the company has expanded to bring to market the *UniQ* model, sold worldwide since 2018 \(5,000 sold to 12\-2020, 20% internationally\). Orders grew twelve\-fold between 2019 and 2020; by 12\-2020, *Sunamp* had an order book worth GBP50,000,000. In recognition of this robust growth, in 2020 the company signed the lease for a factory in South Korea, where an annual capacity of up to 60,000 units will meet initial demand from Asian markets. 

 For domestic heating, *Sunamp* heat batteries can be charged with energy from almost any source, provide high efficiency storage, and release heat on demand. They have saved homeowners money and reduced carbon emissions by minimising heat loss from storage and increasing use of locally generated renewable energy and cheap off\-peak electricity. Recognising the potential of heat batteries to reduce costs for homeowners most in need, *Sunamp* has worked with UK housing associations to install heat batteries in 1,500 properties, lowering bills and increasing comfort for residents at risk of fuel poverty.

#  2. Underpinning research 

##  The challenge: solving the stability issue of heat storage materials 

 Heat storage technology has a key role to play in increasing both energy efficiency and the use of renewables in the heating and cooling sector, which contributes almost 40% of global energy\-related carbon emissions \( *International Energy Agency* report, 2018\). The core component of heat battery technology is a phase change material \(PCM\) that absorbs heat on melting and releases it on freezing. Salt hydrates are leading candidates for use as PCMs due to their high energy density, plentiful supply, low cost, safe use and sustainability. In particular, sodium acetate trihydrate \(SAT\), with a melting point of 58°C, provides heat release at an ideal temperature for domestic use. However, SAT suffered from two key issues that resulted in non\-reproducible performance and poor long\-term stability, thus preventing its practical use as a heat store. Firstly, incongruent melting of SAT led to irreversible phase segregation into undesirable anhydrous sodium acetate. All previous attempts to solve this problem relied on either \(1\) working with more dilute solutions of SAT, causing decreased energy densities and less well\-defined freezing points, or \(2\) use of thickening agents that merely suspend the denser anhydrous SAT in solution. Secondly, SAT exhibits sub\-cooling, whereby crystallisation does not occur until substantially below its freezing point. Whilst this can be overcome through the use of a nucleating agent based on disodium hydrogenphosphate \(DSHP\), it has previously been observed that this nucleating agent deactivates through an unknown mechanism if heated above 75\-80°C. 

##  Overcoming incongruent melting and sub\-cooling to provide reliable and long\-lasting PCM heat storage 

 UK\-based SME *Sunamp Ltd* began developing heat battery technology in 2006 but found that the failure of SAT prevented progress. Seeking research input to tackle this problem, the company made contact with EaStCHEM Professor Colin Pulham, who brought expertise in crystallisation science **\[R1, R2\]**. Collaborative research led by Pulham for *Sunamp* \(2010\-2014\) succeeded in overcoming incongruent melting by developing polymer\-based additives that at low concentrations act as crystal\-habit modifiers, suppressing the formation of the solid anhydrous sodium acetate. As a result, the new SAT\-based material withstands repeated melting and freezing cycles without degradation, while maintaining both its energy density and the desired melting point of 58°C. *In situ* X\-ray powder diffraction experiments at the *Diamond Light Source* were used to interrogate, in real time, the structural and chemical behaviour of these new SAT formulations during repeated temperature cycling, and confirmed complete inhibition of the precipitation of anhydrous sodium acetate over a wide range of conditions **\[R3\]**. 

 X\-ray diffraction studies also identified, for the first time, that the active form of the nucleator is the dihydrate of DSHP and that thermal deactivation of this nucleator is caused by its dehydration into anhydrous DSHP, which does not act as a nucleator **\[R3\]**. These results identified the dehydration temperature of DSHP dihydrate and enabled *Sunamp* to configure its heat batteries to avoid deactivation. 

 This work resulted in a new formulation of PCM based on SAT that retains its high energy density and thermodynamic stability over multiple cycles \(>40,000 shown in testing\), with retention of a distinct and reproducible freezing/melting transition. Patent protection for the formulation was granted in 2014 **\[R4\]**. This PCM has set the international standard for cycling stability through the *RAL Quality Mark*, gaining the first and only *A Grade RAL Certification* for stability over 10,000 cycles. 

 Further work \(2014\-2015\), supported by EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account funding, identified an alternative, cost\-effective bulk source of the essential polymer component, to enable production of the SAT PCM formulation at a price compatible with large\-scale commercialisation. 

 The developed research methodology has subsequently been used \(2015 to present\) to produce PCM formulations \(and additional joint Pulham\- *Sunamp* IP\) based on other salt hydrates with different melting temperatures, including strontium bromide hexahydrate \(88°C – for higher temperature radiator storage\) **\[R5\]** and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate \(43°C – with applications for coupling heat batteries to low temperature heat pumps, and heat packs for treatment of frostbite\) **\[R6\]**. Investigation of potential isostructural relationships between nitrates of magnesium, calcium, and strontium resulted in the discovery and characterisation of a nucleator for formulations based on calcium nitrate tetrahydrate, enabling reproducible nucleation.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 

 **Figure 1.** Timeline showing development of impact from the underpinning research described in Section 2 \(blue lines/text refer to outputs referenced in Section 3\) **\[S1\]**. 

Based on the new stable formulation of salt hydrate PCM developed by EaStCHEM Professor Colin Pulham, *Sunamp Ltd* has brought to market the world’s first commercially viable residential heat batteries, allowing the company to grow quickly to reach worldwide orders worth GBP50,000,000. In homes, *Sunamp* heat batteries maximise the use of locally generated renewable energy and off\-peak electricity and increase energy efficiency, thereby reducing carbon emissions and saving households money. Installations in social housing properties have shown the particular benefit that heat battery use brings to residents at the greatest risk of fuel poverty, and given social housing providers a valuable, low\-maintenance solution for decarbonisation. 

##  Economic and commercial impact of the world’s first commercially viable PCM\-based residential heat battery 

 Based on the patented formulation for SAT PCM **\[R4\]**, originating from Pulham’s research, *Sunamp Ltd* has developed the world’s first commercially viable residential thermal energy storage systems \(i.e. heat batteries\). The company attributes this achievement in large part to the EaStCHEM research that allowed them to “ *harness the potential of salt hydrates as a heat store*”, confirming that “ *Sunamp would not exist without Pulham’s research*” **\[S1, p10\]**. 

 *Sunamp*’s residential heat batteries **\[S2\]** \(typical installation shown in Figure 2\) provide efficient, high density heat storage with an advertised lifetime of over 50 years and at a cost that is competitive with conventional systems – all properties that stem from EaStCHEM research to enable the long\-term stability of salt hydrate PCM and reduce its cost **\[S1, p4\-5\]**. 

 

 **Figure 2.** Sunamp heat battery \(right\), showing space saved compared to traditional hot water cylinder \(left\). 

Since August 2013, *Sunamp* has grown rapidly from development of the early *SunampPV* model, primarily deployed in large UK trials from 2014 \(1,000 units sold\) **\[S1, p4\]** to full commercialisation of the *UniQ* model, available worldwide since 2018 \(5,000 units sold to 12\-2020, 20% beyond the UK\) **\[S1, p9\]**. The resulting economic success for *Sunamp* includes the following **\[S1, p6\-7\]**: 

-  Total investment of GBP12,000,000 raised 

-  Total revenue of GBP10,000,000 

-  A twelve\-fold growth in orders between 2019 and 2020 – and a current order book worth GBP50,000,000, despite the impact of the Covid\-19 pandemic. Major purchase orders have been signed with partner companies in the UK, Netherlands, France, Germany and South Korea \(Figure 1\). 

-  Agreement, in 2020, for the lease of a factory in South Korea, with an annual capacity to produce up to 60,000 units, which will meet initial demand from Asian markets. 

 *Sunamp* has created 52 jobs \(headcount: 52; FTEs: 50\) **\[S1, p8\]**. Economic benefit extends to more than 60 distributors, resellers and installers across the UK, along with partners in the UK, Europe and South Korea who distribute *Sunamp* products under their own brands **\[S1, p6\-7\]**. Partner *Fischer Future Heat* confirms the technology as a “ *must have*” hot water solution, providing capabilities unique within the market and popular with customers, and credit its role in driving their business growth and maintaining a strong market position even through the economic challenges of 2020 **\[S3\]**. 

 Grant funding of GBP7,700,000 to *Sunamp*, underpinned by further PCMs developed through Pulham research, has enabled the company to extend their technology into new applications **\[S1, p11\]**. These include automotive \(business unit since 2018, developing heat management innovations for engine warm\-up, cabin heating, and electric vehicle range consistency\) and commercial/industrial applications \(business unit since 2019, for greater control, reliability and security of supply and recovery of waste heat\) **\[S1, p11\-12\]**. *Sunamp* also worked with Pulham to respond to the Covid\-19 pandemic; in 12\-2020, *Sunamp* brought to market the *Permafrost VacSafe*, providing long\-lasting \-70°C storage for the distribution of vaccines **\[S1, p12\]**. 

##  Environmental and economic benefit through the use of heat batteries 

 For domestic users, *Sunamp* heat batteries provide highly efficient heat storage and enable increased use of locally generated renewable energy and off\-peak electricity, thereby reducing use of conventional fossil energy sources and carbon emissions and saving households money. 

 *Sunamp* heat batteries greatly reduce heat loss compared to traditional hot water cylinders. Analysis of the emissions saved through this effect, across all devices installed to the end of 2019, shows that 4.6ktCO<sub>2</sub> have been saved as of late 2020 **\[S5, p9\]**. For each device, this is a saving equivalent to 26% of the UK annual per capita residential emissions **\[S5, p10\]**. Even taking into account the carbon footprint arising from manufacture of the heat batteries, all devices installed to the end of 2018 have achieved carbon payback and a net reduction in carbon emissions **\[S5, p9\]**. Reduced heat loss also saves homeowners money on bills – in trials, a saving of GBP67 per year for every household **\[S4, p6\]**. 

 In homes previously struggling with inefficient heating from electric boilers and wet radiators, *Sunamp* heat batteries have delivered a steady supply of heat charged almost entirely with off\-peak electricity **\[S4, p10\]**. This has increased comfort and reduced the need to overheat, resulting in 35% reduction in energy usage **\[S4, p32; S4, p79\]**. *Sunamp* heat batteries have also been installed in combination with solar photovoltaics \(PV\) to displace gas burn in a combi boiler, providing between 55\-63% of hot water free of charge **\[S4, p10\]**. 

 Ultimately, Sunamp heat batteries offer an energy\-efficient, affordable and fully controllable route by which households can move to all\-electric and renewable energy solutions, providing an immediate viable alternative to the use of fossil fuels for heat. They can be easily retrofitted to decarbonise heating in existing housing, and provide the enabling technology needed to introduce heat pumps to existing properties without excessive, costly and impractical insulation. With heating and cooling consuming almost half of total energy use in the UK, and more than 80% in every home, heat batteries can make a major contribution to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 

##  Reduced fuel poverty and operational improvements for social housing providers 

 *Sunamp*’s work with UK housing associations, which has seen heat batteries installed in 1,500 properties since August 2013 **\[S1, p6\]**, has shown the particular benefit that heat battery installation brings to residents experiencing fuel poverty. Fuel poverty affects around 4.5 million households in the UK, with residents struggling to pay bills, unable to maintain comfortable temperatures in their homes, or unable to use heating or hot water at all. 

 
 **Figure 3.** Housing association resident and heat battery recipient Joan, who has noted valuable savings and increased comfort **\[S4, p20; S6\]**.* 

 Testimony from residents who have received *Sunamp* heat batteries confirms the improvement to their quality of life: *""It saves a lot of money, put it that way. You’re getting your hot water for free. Before that, this house was a really cold, cold house…It makes a lovely difference.”* \(Figure 3\) **\[S6\]**. 

 *Castle* *Rock Edinvar* housing association, who have had *Sunamp* heat batteries installed in hundreds of properties, confirms their significance as a “ *genuine solution to fuel poverty*” **\[S7\]**. The association has also seen multiple other improvements to their operations as a result of heat battery installation. Reduced heat loss helps them meet statutory obligations under the *Energy Efficiency Standard for Social Housing*. In addition, with both gas safety checks and legionella testing no longer required when heat batteries replace gas boilers and water tanks, money is saved as well as safety increased **\[S7\]**. This is a valuable contribution to mitigating the cost burden of compliance – their biggest growth area in expenditure **\[S7\]**. *Castle Rock Edinvar* also confirms the important influence that the availability of *Sunamp* heat batteries has had on their strategic thinking around decarbonisation, providing “ *a solution for future legislation*” and technology to “ *disrupt our approach in a safe way*” **\[S7\]**.

 Research on Anthony Burgess by Professor Andrew Biswell and Dr Paul Wake has created new worldwide audiences for the novelist’s publications, making them available in countries where they had been censored, with translations into Maltese, Chinese, Malay, Turkish and Romanian appearing for the first time. Biswell is the Director of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation, which has revived and significantly broadened the cultural appeal of the writer’s legacy among twenty\-first\-century audiences and artists extending public and creative engagement well beyond *A Clockwork Orange* \(1962\) *.* The research has stimulated the proliferation of new cultural productions across various genres and media, including theatrical performances, films, music and public artworks. As a result of this work by Biswell and Wake, the annual royalty income of the Burgess Estate rose by over 70%, from GBP149,970 \(2014\) to GBP255,585 \(2018\) with new works, broadcasts and events reaching a global audience of over 980,000.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Biswell’s and Wake’s research is centred on the Burgess archives and an ambitious editorial project supported by a university press, and underpinned by three interconnected aims: discovery, dissemination and innovation. A long\-term commitment to these goals was confirmed by the secondment of Biswell, who remains a full Professor at the university, to the Directorship of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation in 2010. 

 Biswell’s *The Real Life of Anthony Burgess* \(2005\) has influenced and enlivened public perception of the writer’s legacy well beyond the academy. Based on extensive archival research and more than 200 interviews with Burgess’s friends, editors and peers, this biography traced the trajectory of Burgess’s life for the first time and revealed a fully rounded portrait of a notoriously self\-concealing writer. It sold more than 6,000 copies and received widespread critical acclaim: it was named as a *Guardian* Book of the Year in 2005 and was awarded the Portico Prize for North\-West Book of the Year in 2006 **\[1\]**. *A Clockwork Orange: The Restored Edition* \(2012\) was equally ground\-breaking in revisiting Burgess’s iconic novel. Celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of its first publication, Biswell’s newly edited text includes an introduction, explanatory notes, an expanded Nadsat glossary and critical essays. The introduction demonstrates the depth of Burgess’s knowledge of dystopian literature and positions him as a linguistic pioneer within the genre. Biswell’s annotations illustrate previously overlooked aspects of the text, such as the creative misquotations from Shakespeare and Gerard Manley Hopkins. Penguin has sold more than 61,000 copies in paperback since December 2013 **\[2\].** 

 Conceived, guided and co\-ordinated by Biswell and Wake, the Irwell Edition of the Works of Anthony Burgess \(2017–\) is an ongoing project, published by Manchester University Press. This first scholarly edition of Burgess’s novels and non\-fiction \(including stage plays, film scripts, letters, audio\-visual archives and notebooks\) aims to restore ‘lost’ writing to the canon of the writer’s already available works. Drawing on original research in diasporic archives located in Manchester, Austin \(Texas\), Angers \(France\), Hamilton \(Ontario\) and Caen \(Normandy\), the edition establishes Burgess’s significance within the twentieth\-century canon by relating his work to that of other prominent literary figures, such as Shakespeare, Hopkins, James Joyce, John Keats and J. G. Ballard, as well as artistic media \(music halls, silent cinemas and photography\). The Irwell Edition has also crystallised and reinforced the author’s cultural significance for Manchester—his place of birth—by including novels set in the city, such as *A Vision of Battlements* \(1965\) and *The Pianoplayers* \(1986\), and incorporating appendices that demonstrate and document the writer’s rootedness in the city. Bringing together a panel of international experts, the edition targets a global readership by purposefully reconfiguring Burgess as a cosmopolitan writer whose creative vision encompassed places such as Gibraltar \( *A Vision of Battlements*, edited by Biswell in 2017\) **\[3\]**, New York \( *Puma*, edited by Wake in 2018\) **\[4\]** and Italy \( *ABBA ABBA*, 2019\). Other volumes in the Irwell Edition, such as *The Pianoplayers* \(2017\) and *This Man and Music* \(2020\), focus attention on Burgess as a musician **\[5\]**. 

 *Obscenity and the Arts* \(2018\), a cross\-disciplinary collaboration with the graphic designer Adam Griffiths and feminist critic Germaine Greer, provides an innovative examination of Burgess’s writing and lecturing on literary censorship. Edited and introduced by Biswell, the volume explores Burgess’s struggle with censorship in Malta between 1968 and 1974. It is presented as a montage of biographical narrative, lecture text, feminist response, documentary photography and new artwork, and constitutes a valuable excavation of a little\-known period in Burgess’s life **\[6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The International Anthony Burgess Foundation \(IABF\) has generated significant economic impact and subsequent investment in the arts. The IABF has also curated new national and international cultural production, reinvigorated the celebration, commemoration and critical reappraisal of Burgess’s legacy across diverse audiences, platforms and locales, and contributed to our understanding of literature’s impact on national and local identity. 

 **Economic impact and investment in the arts** 

 As a result of the publications produced by Biswell and Wake, including translations, the annual royalty income of the Burgess Estate rose by over 70%, from GBP149,970 \(2014\) to GBP255,585 \(2018\). The success of this publishing strategy is evidenced by the fact that new editions of Burgess’s work have led to sales of 301,628 since 2014, including translations of Biswell’s 2012 edition of *A Clockwork Orange* **\[A\]**. In addition to generating significant income, this work has made an outstanding contribution to the cultural ecology of the city and the region. 

 Seconded to the IABF as director and CEO since July 2010, Biswell has established it as one of the premier live literature venues in Manchester, hosting more than 200 cultural events in 2019 alone. Under Biswell's artistic direction, the Burgess Foundation presents an illustrious series of book launches and literature readings, concerts, film screenings, archive tours and public exhibitions. Attendance at these events is consistently strong, with estimated audiences of more than 35,000 at the venue from 2013 to 2019. The IABF’s long\-standing partnerships with the *Observer* newspaper and the *Guardian* Media Group provide opportunities for new and emerging writers associated with the IABF to be published and mentored by industry professionals. The Foundation carries out partnership events with external organisations such as the National Portrait Gallery, the Edinburgh International Book Festival, Random House, Carcanet Press, Comma, Faber and Faber, Penguin Classics, Manchester Central Library, Chetham’s Library, Kino Film Festival, the Manchester Comedy Festival and the Manchester Science Festival. Since 2011, the Foundation has been the main hub venue for the annual Manchester Literature Festival **\[A\]**. 

 The growing interest in Burgess among non\-academic audiences is evidenced by the decision of BBC Radio 3 to feature his work in a series of broadcasts since 2012. In 2017 Biswell was the consultant for five BBC radio essays, curating talks on morality, colonialism, class, criticism and language. Biswell also advised on the first radio production of *Oedipus the King* \(1972\), translated and adapted by Burgess. Listener numbers evidence the success of these broadcasts: the former attracted 49,000 listeners per programme \(245,000 listeners in total\); the latter attracted 76,000 listeners **\[A\]**. The current reappraisal of Burgess’s cultural legacy is most clearly demonstrated by the new appreciation of his work as a musician. Radio 3 broadcasts include a two\-hour edition of *Saturday Classics* \(2017\), written and presented by Biswell, which examined musical influences on Burgess \(with an audience of 145,000\), and an adaptation of *A Clockwork Orange* \(2017\), which featured music composed by Burgess and re\-scored for the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. The latter was recorded before a live audience of 406 at the Middleton Hall in Hull and the broadcast reached an audience of 70,000 listeners. On 22/3/20, the BBC broadcast Burgess’s ‘lost’ play *Schreber*, featuring Christopher Eccleston. Biswell discovered this unpublished play, based on one of Freud’s case histories, in the IABF archives. The radio drama was selected by the *Observer* as one of its cultural highlights of the week **\[A\]**. Following the Coronavirus lockdown in March 2020, new online exhibitions curated by the IABF have included ‘Portraits of Anthony Burgess’, ‘Burgess on Tape’, ‘The Music of Anthony Burgess’, ‘Banned Books’ and ‘Burgess and the Atomic Age’. Collectively, these online exhibitions have received 15,220 hits, demonstrating the popularity and importance of the Burgess Foundation’s digital presence **\[A\]**. 

 **New cultural production** 

 Biswell’s and Wake’s work has directly stimulated new cultural production incorporating writing, film, music, theatre and visual art. In 2017, the Manchester International Festival commissioned *No End to Enderby*, a pair of artists’ films by Stephen Sutcliffe and Graham Eatough, adapted from two novels by Burgess. The artists explained how Biswell’s research had been influential in creating the films: ‘ *The Real Life of Anthony Burgess* was a primary reference point for us in creating *No End to Enderby* \[…\] It provided an invaluable background to Burgess’s life from which we were able to create our central characters \[… \] Throughout the pre\- and post\-production of our films we consulted with Andrew to support our ideas and creative process, and in order to have access to a wider context to our understanding of Burgess and his works. These conversations formed an important part of our application to the Contemporary Arts Society’s annual award in association with the Whitworth Gallery, which we won in 2015’. These films received the GBP40,000 Contemporary Art Society Award and were exhibited at the Whitworth Art Gallery \(2017\) and the Glasgow International Festival \(2018\), where they attracted 95,195 visitors. Biswell participated in public discussions with the artists as part of the Manchester and Glasgow festival programmes and contributed an introduction to an illustrated book of storyboards, based on the two films, published by Lux in 2020 and marketed to visual artists and curators **\[B\].** 

 In the same year, the IABF and the Manchester International Festival jointly commissioned Raymond Yiu to compose *The World Was Once All Miracle*, a song\-cycle based on six Burgess poems. The inaugural performance by the BBC Philharmonic at the Bridgewater Hall attracted a live audience of 2,341, in addition to a worldwide Radio 3 audience of approximately 169,000; a second performance at the Barbican Hall in London generated audience numbers of 1,943 \(live audience\) and approximately 108,000 \(Radio 3 audience\). Yiu commented that ‘\[the\] International Anthony Burgess Foundation has played a vital part in the becoming of the composition… they gave me informed and enlightening guidance in navigating the labyrinth of materials – both in\-house as well as from other Burgess archives in other parts of the world – in order to choose the most suitable ones for my composition. Without their help, it would have been otherwise an extremely daunting task’ **\[C\]**. 

 Further evidence of encouraging new cultural production is provided by the writer Adam Roberts, who in 2018 collaborated with Biswell to produce a new novel, *The Black Prince*, based on an unpublished Burgess film script. Roberts writes: ‘I re\-read Biswell’s *The Real Life of Anthony Burgess*, by way of positioning myself with respect to a “Burgess”\-y creative praxis: not just producing pastiche, but trying to understand what Burgess was trying to do, mimicking his methods of writing \[…\] Prof. Biswell was supportive and helpful, read the first draft of the completed novel and assisted in several ways with the publication process. After publication he staged a public conversation in Manchester at which he and I discussed Burgess as a novelist and talked about the new novel’ **\[D\]**. 

 In 2018, the Liverpool Everyman Theatre presented a stage adaptation of *A Clockwork Orange*. The production showcased a new score by Burgess that had been discovered by Biswell in the IABF archive. Many of the audience \(4,560 over 21 performances\) were young people who had never previously visited the theatre **\[E\]**. In November 2019, The Burgess Foundation hosted ‘Conversations with the Anthony Burgess Cassette Archive’, a performance of new experimental sound art, created in response to materials assembled by Biswell from the Burgess audio archive. Participants explained how the archive had shaped their compositions in a series of publicly available podcasts. Contributing artist Robin Rimbaud, aka Scanner, discussed how the project brought together his interest in analogue technology, hauntology, archives and experimental performance. Dr Alan Dunn, the curator of the project, spoke about the significance of bringing archives into connection with creative practice, thereby ‘keeping them contemporary, getting artists to re\-work them, \[and\] find nuances that perhaps a historian or archivist might not recognise’ **\[F\].** 

 **National and local identity** 

 At a national level, the contemporary reappraisal of Burgess’s reputation in response to the work of the IABF is underlined by the presence of *A Clockwork Orange* on the OCR A\-level syllabus of texts recommended for Comparative and Contextual Study since 2017. This indicates the extent to which Burgess’s writing has become part of the urgent ongoing debate about how the twentieth\-century canon should be configured for contemporary readers of school and college age. In 2020, demonstrating the increased national interest in Burgess’s legacy, Biswell was asked to contribute to the submission for a Blue Plaque installation at Burgess’s 1960s residence in Chiswick **\[G\].** 

 At a local level, the work of Biswell and Wake has significantly raised the profile of Burgess within Manchester. Margaret Drabble, delivering the 2019 Anthony Burgess Lecture, commented that: ‘After a bohemian and adventurous life, much of which was spent abroad, Burgess has been claimed by his own city, Manchester’ **\[H\]**. A mural of Burgess in the city, created by the street artist Tankpetrol in Manchester’s Northern Quarter for the 2016 Cities of Hope Festival, is now a local landmark. Google searching for website and blog responses to this mural alone brings up 429 national and international hits. This public artwork demonstrates both the Burgess Foundation’s impact on the emerging stature of Burgess in the city of his birth, and the ways in which his reinvigorated reputation continues to provoke new creative work from a variety of contemporary artists **\[I\].** 

 **Increased international audiences and reputation** 

 Burgess’s reputation as an international figure has been greatly enhanced by Biswell’s and Wake’s work. During the period of evaluation, articles on Burgess appeared in at least 33 countries, reaching an estimated circulation of over 1,600,000 million **\[J\]**. *Obscenity and the Arts,* published in 2018, examines the question of Burgess’s reputation in Malta, where his books were banned and 50 titles from his private library confiscated by the authorities. The publication of this book has led directly to a new focus on Burgess in the Maltese media, and the first Maltese theatre production of *A Clockwork Orange*, which was staged in November 2019. Reviewing this production, which was aimed at school\-age audiences aged 14\+, the *Times of Malta* wrote: ‘ *Larinġa Mekkanika* was a fast\-paced, intense adaptation which was faithful to Burgess’s vision and final message \[…\] It also facilitates the necessary understanding that free will is an essential aspect of our very flawed, but very genuine, humanity’ **\[K\]**. The repercussions of the IABF’s international reach are demonstrated by the writer’s prominence in Manchester’s successful bid to become a UNESCO City of Literature in 2018. The UNESCO City of Literature website emphasises the significance of Burgess and his legacy to the city of Manchester **\[L\].**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Public health policies rely traditionally on quantitative, mortality\- and morbidity\-based measures of health and well\-being. Co\-directed by Mark Jackson and Felicity Thomas, Exeter’s unique World Health Organization Collaborating Centre on Culture and Health \(WHO Centre\) has embedded awareness of the historical and cultural determinants of health within the cross\-sectoral work of WHO Europe. This work has **generated sustained impact on public health policy and practice across the WHO European Region.** Through strategic leadership of key committees, contributions to flagship research and policy initiatives, the production of policy briefs and country\-level reports on well\-being, and the delivery of educational workshops on mental health, the **WHO Centre has provided intellectual guidance, practical training, and new forms of qualitative evidence for health policy\-makers, practitioners, service users, and third\-sector organisations**. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The impact of the WHO Centre is underpinned by the work of Mark Jackson, whose research explores the social and cultural determinants of health and medicine in the twentieth and twenty\-first centuries, and Felicity Thomas, the Centre co\-director, whose research focuses on the cultural contexts of health in the contemporary world. Their cross\-disciplinary work together has generated new frameworks for understanding culture as a core determinant of health, leading to their close involvement in the development and activities of two flagship policy initiatives at WHO Europe: the Cultural Contexts of Health programme; and the Behavioural and Cultural Insights Unit. 

 Jackson’s research focuses on how social and cultural factors have shaped medical and scientific knowledge, health\-care policies, and personal and political narratives of health. His work on the global history of allergy \(Wellcome Trust University Award, £193,000, 1998\-2004\) revealed the historical and cultural specificity of links between socio\-economic conditions and patterns of health and disease. Analysis of changing cultural norms and regulatory cultures highlighted how trends in allergic diseases such as asthma and hay fever relate to evolving forms of domestic, occupational, and outdoor environments, as well as variations in food consumption and hygiene \[ **3.1**\]. Developing further the notion that health policies and practice are influenced by culturally\-specific norms and values, Jackson has examined the manner in which scientific and clinical studies of stress and trauma in the Western world have continually refashioned – and been refashioned by – public understandings and personal experiences of mental health and well\-being \(WT Programme Grant, £454,118, 2007\-11\) \[ **3.2**\]. 

 As part of a multi\-stranded research programme on lifestyle, health and disease across the twentieth and early twenty\-first centuries \(WT Senior Investigator Award, £850,000, 2013\-18\), Jackson’s latest work reveals the ways in which cultural and demographic change, as well as adverse social and occupational circumstances, can disrupt individual and family stability and threaten emotional and physical well\-being across the life course. This work suggests that we are aged as much by culture as we are by biology \[ **3.3, 3.4**\]. Jackson’s research has been recognised in professional awards \(most notably the Royal Society Wilkins\-Bernal\-Medawar medal in 2018 for his significant contributions to medical history and medical humanities\), appointments to Wellcome Trust, AHRC, and WHO advisory committees and funding panels, and a successful bid to establish and direct the trans\-disciplinary Wellcome Centre for Cultures and Environments of Health \(WCCEH; funded by WT Centre Award, £4.1 million, 2017\-22; extension award, £1.43 million, 2022\-24\), within which the WHO Centre sits. 

 By leading the development of new collaborative, inter\- and trans\-disciplinary approaches to health research – grounded in medical humanities and qualitative, participatory methodologies – Jackson and Thomas have generated clearer understandings of the cultural determinants of health and well\-being. A study of antibiotic resistance, co\-authored by Jackson and Thomas with members of the WHO Centre, demonstrated that tackling this complex risk to health demands systematic investigation of the historical, cultural, and socio\-economic drivers of antibiotic usage \[ **3.5**\]. Together, Jackson’s and Thomas’s research shows that addressing global health challenges of this nature requires recognising the impact of cultural contexts on scientific knowledge, the development and delivery of health\-care policies and practice, and personal and collective experiences of illness, health, and well\-being.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The work of the WHO Centre has had a direct and sustained impact on the internal and member\-state oriented activities of the WHO Regional Office for Europe, as well as on practitioner and service\-user communities in Belarus and Ukraine. 

 Established in 2016 on the basis of Jackson’s research expertise and, in the words of WHO Director of Cultural Contexts of Health, Nils Fietje, Jackson’s ‘leadership ... of the history of medicine, and latterly, the medical humanities community’ \[ **5.1**\], the WHO Centre at Exeter is the only WHO Collaborating Centre focusing on culture and health. It was set up to enhance public health policy\-making through a more nuanced understanding of the cultural factors behind perceptions of health and delivery of healthcare **\[5.2\].** Regarded by senior staff at WHO Europe as one of the four ‘building blocks’ \[ **5.2**\] of the ‘absolutely novel’ \[ **5.1**\] Cultural Contexts of Health \(CCH\) programme, the WHO Centre at Exeter has strengthened CCH capacity at WHO and provided qualitative evidence from medical history and social sciences ‘to facilitate more robust policymaking’ \[ **5.2**\]. Led by Jackson and Thomas, the WHO Centre and CCH programme have been instrumental in driving change in health policy and practice. An independent evaluation conducted for WHO Europe in 2019 concluded that CCH is ‘an innovative, critical project’ that is creating ‘a focus for culture and health’, not only centrally within the WHO Regional Office for Europe but also within its member states \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **1. Influencing policy and organisational practice of WHO Europe** 

 The WHO Centre and CCH programme were launched after the Director of CCH at WHO Europe worked closely with Jackson on a chapter for the 2015 European Health Report calling for greater awareness of the cultural contexts of health and well\-being \[ **5.4**\]. The WHO Centre has provided Jackson and Thomas with a platform for shaping WHO policy. Jackson is Core Advisor to CCH and Chair of the CCH Expert Advisory Group; Thomas is one of its members. Jackson’s significance to WHO is evident in his membership of the European Advisory Committee on Health Research \(EACHR\), which feeds directly to the WHO Regional Director. Tasked with ‘developing the H&SS methodologies toolkit’ \[ **5.2**\], Jackson and Thomas have provided a ‘unique intellectual ... contribution’ at WHO Europe, sitting at the forefront of ‘a unique conversation’ about the inter\-relations between culture and health \[ **5.1**\]. According to the Chair of EACHR and President of the International Children’s Center at Bilkent University in Ankara, the work of the WHO Centre is ‘especially important in shaping WHO Europe’s approaches to reporting on, and addressing, health challenges from a cultural perspective, as well as training policy\-makers and practitioners in qualitative methods’ \[ **5.5**\]. 

 Jackson and Thomas have further embedded cultural factors at the heart of WHO Europe through a number of collaborative outputs and initiatives: 

 \(a\) **WHO** **policy briefs** *.* The first CCH policy brief, *Culture Matters* \(2017\), co\-authored by Thomas and members of the CCH Expert Advisory Group, chaired by Jackson, is regarded as a ‘cornerstone ... publication for CCH’ \[ **5.1**\], one that has also attracted attention from stakeholders beyond WHO \[ **5.3**\]. A second cross\-disciplinary policy brief \(2019\), coordinated and co\-authored by Jackson and Thomas, with other members of the WHO Centre, explored the historical and cultural contexts of antibiotic resistance \(ABR\) – a key global health challenge – and included a toolkit of qualitative, participatory research methods for policy\-makers. According to the Technical Officer for WHO Europe’s Control of Antimicrobial Resistance Programme, this publication managed to ‘open up and review the field \[of ABR\-control\]’, highlighting the risk of being ‘too narrow in focusing on solutions or what we think the solution is without really focusing on who we’re talking to, or how we should be talking to them’ \[ **5.1**\]. 

 \(b\) **European Health Report.** In recognition of their expertise in qualitative research on culture and health, Jackson and Thomas were the only university\-based contributors to the 2018 **European Health Report** \[ **5.6**\]. The Report stressed the importance of moving beyond quantitative forms of health information towards mobilising qualitative evidence from research in the humanities and social sciences – including historical and ethnographic studies – in order to report more effectively on health and well\-being and improve health services. Introducing the Report at the 2018 WHO Regional Committee, the WHO Europe Director of Information, Evidence, Research and Innovation regarded the new forms of qualitative evidence generated by these approaches as necessary for developing more holistic understandings of health across the life course \[ **5.6**\]. 

 \(c\) Complementing these new approaches to monitoring and addressing health challenges, the development of **innovative country\-level reporting on well\-being** has been led by Thomas, with support from Jackson and other members of the WHO Centre. The first full report – on Italy – uses historical sources and qualitative evidence of subjective well\-being alongside traditional quantitative indicators. It was favourably reviewed in 2020 by the Italian Statistics Agency and by the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development, who declared that ‘culture is an integral aspect of well\-being . . . we were excited to see someone tackle this question with a mixed\-methods approach’ \[ **5.7**\]. 

 \(d\) The leadership demonstrated by Jackson and Thomas is having a broader impact within WHO. With WHO Centre guidance, the CCH programme is being replicated in the US through a collaboration launched in April 2020 between WHO and the **Robert Wood Johnson Foundation**. The Director of CCH has noted that the WHO is ‘delighted to see that the work being done in the WHO European Region can be of use and inspiration elsewhere’ \[ **5.1**\]. 

 \(e\) Building on its work in CCH, the WHO Centre has played a key role in the activities and impact of a new **Behavioural and Cultural Insights Unit \(BCI\)**, established at WHO Europe in 2020, and helped to develop the European Programme of Work: United Action for Better Health in Europe, which sets out the strategic vision of WHO Europe for the next five years **\[5.8\]**. The work of Jackson and Thomas has been central to formulating and substantiating the health\-care priorities of BCI, within which CCH now sits **\[5.8\]**. A paper on managing recovery from COVID\-19, co\-authored by Jackson, has been accessed over 23,000 times and has helped to shape the approaches taken by researchers and policy\-makers advising the German Government’s early COVID\-19 response **\[5.8\]**. This work also ‘laid the foundation for WHO Europe’s policy framework on pandemic fatigue prevention and management’ **\[5.8\]**. 

 **2. Guiding mental health policy and practice at regional and national levels** 

 Drawing on the combined expertise of Thomas and Jackson in tracing the cultural and historical determinants of mental health across the life course, the Centre has expanded its work into Central and Eastern Europe \(CEE\). In 2018\-2019, grants awarded by Medical Research Council and Global Challenges Research Fund TrACES funding \(2018\-19; PI: Thomas; CI Jackson; £54,657 combined\) enabled high\-level training and capacity\-building in Belarus in Ukraine, in collaboration with national stakeholders. These projects were instigated at a 2017 Centre\-sponsored workshop on mental health reform in CEE, delivered by Thomas and hosted by the National Institute for Mental Health, Czechia. Attended by 30 policy\-makers and practitioners from Czechia, Poland, Armenia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania, the workshop provided insights on cultural factors that affect the transition from institutional to community\-based health\-care systems, and generated a platform for discussion, guidance, and support \[ **5.9**\] **.** Participants from Ukraine and Belarus sought further collaboration and guidance on reforming their national systems of mental health care using a CCH approach \[ **5.10**\], resulting in two projects. 

 \(a\) In 2018, workshops **supporting mental health practice** in cases of early life trauma \(ELT\) in Belarus and Ukraine brought together 41 academics, policy\-makers, practitioners, and civil society for the first time to reconceptualise public health responses to ELT by incorporating historical and cultural perspectives. Feedback indicated that the workshops enhanced understanding and appreciation of the importance of multi\-sectoral and intra\-agency approaches to ELT \[ **5.10**\]. One NGO leader reported that the workshops themselves were ‘events for Belarus’ because ELT ‘was not discussed in that way in the media and amongst civil society’; the participant was subsequently invited by the Social Ministry representative to deliver training to care workers. Participants, including the Deputy Director of the Minsk Psychiatric Clinic, noted how the workshops provided opportunities for changing policy and practice, encouraging them to ‘push harder for increased awareness of ELT at my hospital’, ‘lobby’ for changes in educating practitioners, and develop ‘more intensive interaction with specialists from other disciplines’ \[ **5.10**\]. One participant wrote a report for her organisation about the ‘need to educate people \[who\] work with the traumatised children’ \[ **5.10**\]. In 2020, WHO Europe published a report in the form of narrative essays and case studies written primarily by practitioners, the first of its kind to be published by WHO Europe, testifying to the impact of the WHO Centre on WHO organisational approaches at member\-state level \[ **5.9**\]. 

 \(b\) In 2019, a programme led by Thomas in the Minsk region focused on the use of qualitative methods to **improve understandings of the lived experiences and needs of families in relation to mental illness**. This multidisciplinary, collaborative project enabled the development of effective community\-based care and a forum for peer support. Local psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and sociologists – trained by Thomas in participatory, narrative methods – conducted interviews with families, having previously relied exclusively on quantitative methods of health research. For the Head of the Psychiatric Department of Minsk Psychiatric Clinic, the project ‘completely changed my way of thinking as a doctor. I think this project is what should be taught in all medical institutes, because frankly sometimes doctors don’t feel like they are working with a person but with an object\! . . . I try to observe now what is going on from the cultural point of view, from different perspectives, not just one angle’ \[ **5.10**\]. One of the sociologists who took part observed that ‘the most important \[thing\] is that my personal attitude changed and it’s important to transfer that to the society and to improve quality of life in this family’ \[ **5.10**\]. The project also helped parents and carers become more aware of the support structures available for individuals and families. One parent commented that she had ‘learnt so many things’, especially ‘about the organisations’ available to support her daughter \[ **5.10**\]. Two short films, made with family members about lived experiences of mental illness, are now being used in training programmes for psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and health authorities across the Minsk Region \[ **5.10**\]. 

 Through its contributions to WHO Europe’s flagship initiatives, CCH and BCI, as well as focused work with partners in CEE, the WHO Centre has had a sustained impact on WHO Europe’s policies and practice. Independent evaluation of the CCH programme concluded that the incorporation of CCH ideas into key WHO documents, made possible by the WHO Centre, \`signposts a shift within the WHO, where culture was previously not considered in this manner’ **\[5.3\]**. In recognition of its value to WHO, in September 2020 the WHO Centre was formally re\-designated as a Collaborating Centre for a further four years.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 John Butt’s research has brought historically informed music performance to audiences across the world through his collaboration with Dunedin Consort, a leading Scotland\-based international Baroque ensemble. Since 2014, Butt led and produced seven new primary output recordings, and \~150 performances across the world. Dunedin’s collaboration with Butt has led to increasing critical acclaim, a growing international reputation, and commercial success, with their income increasing steadily from c.GBP120,000 in 2012 to c.GBP725,000 in 2019. Performances have also reached audiences new to Dunedin, presenting unique interpretations of musical works and their historical contexts within new venues, whilst their recordings have sold successfully. Dunedin have also expanded their community and education programme. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The research underpinning Butt’s work with Dunedin comprises monographs and articles as well as practice\-based research, including performances and recordings. The desk\-based element of the research has focused on three main interlocking areas: the original contexts for the works \(whether liturgical, public or courtly and the corresponding venues\), the specifics of historical performance, and the listening practices of audiences at the time. The starting point for this was Butt’s investigation of the role of historically informed performance in contemporary culture \[3.1\], notably identifying the need to use historical knowledge and experience to encourage new creative possibilities in contemporary performance. This challenged the notion that adopting historical parameters would lead to a restriction of performative possibilities. His subsequent research has focused on specific works and composers within this theoretical framework and opened new ways to read and hear Bach's *Passions* \[3.2\] and Monteverdi’s 1610 *Vespers* \[3.3\]. 

  

 Butt’s related practice\-based research takes the form of an extensive catalogue of recordings for Linn Records, which includes Dunedin Consort recordings of landmark performances of Handel, Bach, Mozart and Monteverdi \[e.g. 3.4−3.8\]. In addition, Dunedin’s appearances at prestigious international events have contributed to the research by exploring the relationship between music and context. These have included performances at The Proms \(2017 and 2019\), the Misteria Paschalia festival in Krakow \(2018\), and the Edinburgh International Festival \(2016−2019\). The group has also performed regularly at Wigmore Hall in London and Queen’s Hall in Edinburgh as well as venues across Europe, USA and Latin America. Each recording and performance context has required different degrees and types of scholarly engagement and research. For both recorded and public performance of these works **,** elements of historical knowledge required considerable research and experimentation. The interaction between scholarly ideas and performance ideas/insights is not straightforward and, through setting new parameters \(chorus structure and placing, temporal pacing, listening processes\) of performance engagement, new creative possibilities have emerged. 

 The vocal recordings reflect Butt’s work on the constitution of choruses and their relation to the individual soloists; these recordings have been seminal in developing the concept of ‘soloist led' performance. The key output in this regard is Handel’s *Samson \[*3.7\], which is the first recording in modern times to use a boys’ choir singing together with the soprano soloists. This recording also presents an alternative version of the choruses with soloists alone \(as may have been the case in the first, 1743, performance\). The 18<sup>th</sup>\-century approach to chorus structure is also explored in the Bach Magnificat recording \[3.4\], one of Bach’s Christmas Oratorio \(2016\), and Mozart’s Requiem \(2014\), which was recorded with forces as close as possible to the size of those for its first performance in 1793. 

 Butt’s musicological research has also informed the pacing of these performances — most notably the dramatic flow and division of scenes or individual numbers, and possible tempo relationships between these. Tempo relationships are a significant element of the putative historical listening experience \(e.g. in relation to Monteverdi’s Vespers, \[3.3\]\). Moreover, some of the recordings and performances centre on aspects of the listening process that have largely been ignored in modern concert traditions. For example, the Bach *Magnificat* recording \[3.4\] presents the work within the context of the Christmas Vespers service of 1723, while several other Dunedin performances have taken place in café environments, to help understand the implications of the discursive culture of coffee houses in 18<sup>th</sup>\-century Europe.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Dunedin’s work with Butt uniquely combines reconstructed historical contexts \(e.g. liturgies, coffee houses\) with regeneration of familiar works, opening up a range of potential experiences usually unexplored in performance. Dunedin’s Chief Executive commented that in this Dunedin are unique: *‘where other ensembles draw upon accepted practices in historical performances ... Butt’s research has allowed Dunedin Consort to take these ambitions further and to incorporate the latest pioneering research into our performances and recordings’* \[5.1\]. 

 **4.1 Supporting Dunedin to critical acclaim, reputation and commercial success** 

 Dunedin are covered extensively in the UK press and classical music magazines, featuring prominently in classical music coverage on British radio and television \[5.2\]. For example, performances of Bach’s Magnificat were well\-received by the  [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/01/dunedin-consortbutt-review-bravura-bach-to-ring-in-2019) and the  [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/dunedin-consort-bach-review-wigmore-hall-john-butt-a8706941.html) \(2 Jan 2019\) which stated: *‘Dunedin Consort, under John Butt’s historically\-informed direction, gave a typically dazzling performance of Bach….’* The  [Scotsman](https://www.scotsman.com/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/music-review-lammermuir-festival-opening-weekend-various-venues-east-lothian-1407627) \(Sept 2019\) said of another performance: ‘ *Joy, passion and precision... Butt and his players were rediscovering this well\-known music afresh all over again, and taking their listeners with them*...’ In November 2019 Dunedin’s unique approach was covered by Gramophone magazine \[5.2\], who commented that ‘ *under his \[Butt’s\] sagacious direction, the Dunedin Consort has firmly established a world\-class period\-instrument ensemble’.* 

 Dunedin’s international reputation has grown through the collaboration, illustrated by the many objections raised when Dunedin’s Creative Scotland funding was threatened, a decision that was subsequently reversed \[5.3\]. For example, The Times stated, ‘ *no Scottish ensemble has a bigger international reputation,*’ and a journalist for the Guardian, BBC and Herald, described them as ‘ *world\-class’*. The Director of Lammermuir Festival and Creative Director of Classical Music for Perth Concert Hall commented that *‘Dunedin Consort is a genuinely world\-class ensemble who provide fabulous music making in Scotland as well as acting as cultural ambassadors for Scotland abroad at the highest artistic level’.* 

 Dunedin recordings have enhanced Linn Records’ catalogue with a  [growing discography](https://www.linnrecords.com/artist-dunedin-consort) and strong sales \[5.4\]. Linn Records’ Chief Producer \[5.5\] commented: ‘ *Dunedin Consort, directly influenced by John Butt’s research and practice in historically informed performance, has made a supremely distinctive and influential contribution to classical music in the UK, Europe and across the world. Dunedin’s recordings … have added enormous lustre to the Linn label … Dunedin has become a gold standard for the historical performance of much music of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and this has shown in its strong sales for Linn, within exceptionally difficult market conditions’*. 

 *Monteverdi’s Vespers 1610* \(2017\) was nominated for Best Baroque Vocal at the International Classical Music Awards in 2018. Dunedin, under John Butt’s direction, won a Gramophone Classical Music Award in 2014 and a Grammy nomination in 2015. This, added to other awards and prestigious nominations including the International Classical Music Awards \(2014\), Scottish Album of the Year \(2014, 2016\) and Royal Philharmonic Society awards \(2018\) \[5.6\], confers to Dunedin a status unmatched in Scotland. In 2020 they were nominated for another Gramophone award for their recording of Handel’s *Samson* \(which was also disc of the month in the January 2020 BBC Music Magazine\). 

 Dunedin’s gross income from performance fees and from recording royalties exceeded GBP300,000 in 2016, an upwards trajectory since 2013 \[5.7a\]. As Dunedin’s Chief Executive observed \[5.1\]: *‘that the company has expanded as much as it has done in recent years, from a turnover of around £120,000 in 2013 to £725,000 in 2019, is thanks to the reputation that Dunedin Consort and John Butt have built together’*. 

 **4.2 Increasing and diversifying reach of historically informed performance** 

 Dunedin has had considerable geographical reach, performing at festivals in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, USA, Mexico and Columbia, including the BBC Proms, Edinburgh International Festival, Boston Early Music Festival and Misteria Paschalia, Krakow, and Butt has also toured independently as a conductor in the USA, Netherlands and Hong Kong. Dunedin’s Head of Artistic Planning \[5.4\] noted that Dunedin’s *‘performances continue to be well attended across the world’.* A version of Bach’s *St. John’s Passion* at the Royal Albert Hall at the 2017 Proms was presented with its original liturgy \[3.4\] for a large live audience and subsequently via  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPZC5OJhKSU), expanding access and attracting 77,000 views. Dunedin’s catalogue has also sold well within the classical music market, some recordings reaching the top 5 of the UK’s Classical charts \[5.8\]. 

 Dunedin’s performances challenge audiences’ understanding of key 17<sup>th</sup>\- and 18<sup>th</sup>\-century musical works including by removing them from modern venues. For example, the *Coffee and Enlightenment* series located Bach in a more discursive, less formal environment than the modern concert hall in which they are now traditionally encountered. Inspired by Butt’s research which suggests a contemporary connection of Bach’s secular music with coffee\-house culture, this included 2015 performances at the Glad Café, Glasgow, City of Edinburgh Methodist Church, and Musselburgh’s flexible Brunton Theatre. The  [Herald](https://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/13200767.review-dunedin-consorts-coffee-and-enlightenment/) \(8 Feb 2015\) commented, *‘in terms of getting music out of the concert hall and into a space that appeals to a different crowd, John Butt and the Dunedin Consort couldn’t have chosen a more convivial setting. Roughly half the audience had never been to a Dunedin concert before’.* \[5.2f\] 

 Butt has also appeared regularly in the media, most prominently as host of Radio 4’s  [*Bach: A Man of Passion*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08lgpr7) and BBC2’s *Proms Extra*, both 2017. In Scotland, Dunedin performed regularly in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Perth, Aberdeen and East Lothian. In 2019, Dunedin performed to 12,422 people across 17 local authority areas in Scotland \[5.4\], and total audiences of \~12,000 in 2016 and 2017, compared with 6,291 in 2013 \[5.7b\]. Compared with 16 performances in 2013, Dunedin gave 156 performances between August 2013–December 2020, averaging \~25 each year, with the exception of 2020 due to impacts of Covid\-19 \[5.7b\]. Between 2015−2017 alone there were 26 performances outside of Scotland including prestigious, sold\-out shows in London at the Royal Albert Hall, Wigmore Hall and King’s Place. In addition, Dunedin’s tracks were streamed almost 850,000 times up to November 2019 \[5.4\]. 

 Dunedin run several initiatives aimed at diversifying audiences and performers in Scotland, including annual schools workshops series and workshops for amateur singers of all ages. These culminate each year with a *Children’s Messiah*, conducted by Butt, in Edinburgh and Glasgow, with special performances for some participants in Dunedin’s schools’ programme. Numbers of participants increased from 200 in 2017 to 850 in 2018, with all schools drawn from those high on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation \[5.9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Philip Horne’s editorial and critical work on Henry James has shaped contemporary engagement with this major figure of 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century literature. His research on James’s notebook led to the co\-creation of *Tales from a Master’s Notebook: Stories Henry James Never Wrote*, a collection of short stories, with ten major contemporary novelists, generating new avenues for their creative practice and sparking new ways of thinking about James’s influence and timeliness for writers and readers. The Henry James Reading Group led by Horne has improved wellbeing for attendees and enhanced professional practice both within and beyond the creative industries. He has also deepened pre\-existing audiences’ knowledge of James’s work \(cumulative reach of at least 2,055,000\), in particular demonstrating James’s contemporary vitality through innovative public events and media engagement commemorating the centenary of James’s death in 2016.

Horne’s research covers a wide range of areas, but is unified by a mission to reveal new aspects of James and tell untold stories though a combination of close reading, original research and editorial scholarship in relation to published and unpublished works, and an interest in the implications of James’s unique literary style and his evolving fictional technique. 

 Horne is founding General Editor of the *Complete Fiction of Henry James* for Cambridge University Press. Nine of the projected thirty\-four volumes of this major critical edition have been published since 2008. Horne is also Series Editor of the Penguin Classics Henry James and in 2011 published his edition of *The Portrait of a Lady*, in the introduction of which he argued for the importance of that novel’s experimental daring. One example of this is how the prose requires readers to attune themselves to the narration’s psychological subtlety, whereby deeply significant realities are not named or marked as such by James but represented indirectly \[ **R1**\]. 

 Horne edited *Henry James: Autobiographical Writings* for the Library of America, published in 2016 on the centenary of James’s death, 28 February 1916 \[ **R2**\]. Horne insisted on unusually full \(for the series\) explanatory notes in order to ensure the reader could adequately contextualise these three complex books James wrote about his early life. He also selected other autobiographical material \(essays, tributes, reminiscences from the Notebooks\) to complete the volume and enrich readers’ understanding of the three texts. 

 Horne’s research on the significance of French short story writer Guy de Maupassant in James’ Notebooks led to \[ **R3**\], which argues for the ways in which Maupassant was not only a technical model for James, but also a creative source of inspiration. Horne’s extensive archival work on these Notebooks, which has included compiling a carefully corrected text for inclusion in the Cambridge University Press series, demonstrates that the two longstanding editions of the Notebooks \(1947 and 1987\) fail to meet modern scholarly standards, as described in ‘Letters and Notebooks’ \[ **R4**\]. 

 This research also uncovered a productive series of over 60 unused story ideas and fragments, eleven of which are the basis for the short stories written for *Tales from a Master’s Notebook: Stories Henry James Never Wrote* \[ **R5**\]. This collection of new stories by major contemporary novelists inspired by the ideas in James’s notebooks was conceived and edited by Horne. His introduction reflects on the question of creative inspiration and contextualises how the contents of James’s nine surviving notebooks – private spaces in which he communed with his art – enabled the authors to write stories that give their own ‘impression of life’ \(not Jamesian pastiches\). The collection’s appendix reproduces James’s original notes, allowing readers to trace the raw ideas through to their modern\-day interpretations. 

 With Tamara Follini, Horne edited a special issue of the *Cambridge Quarterly* entitled *Henry James in the Modern World* \(2008\) to which he contributed ‘“Reinstated”: James in Roosevelt’s Washington’ \[ **R6**\], part of a larger project on James and Roosevelt. Examining James’s letters concerning his visit to Roosevelt’s White House in 1905, Horne revealed the nuances of James’s resistance to U.S. imperialism and dislike of Roosevelt, and his complex reactions to American politics and culture more broadly.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Henry James’s writings are often seen as difficult and elitist. However, Philip Horne’s work has changed the way that that this important novelist is represented in contemporary culture. His research on James’s notebooks \[ **R3**\] \[ **R4**\] brought about the co\-creation of *Tales from a Master’s Notebook: Stories Henry James Never Wrote* \[ **R5**\], a collection of short stories by 10 major contemporary novelists, which generated new avenues for their creative practice and sparked new ways of thinking about James’s influence and timeliness for writers and readers alike. The collection grew out of the Henry James Reading Group led by Horne, which has improved wellbeing for attendees and enhanced professional practice both within and beyond the creative industries. Horne has also deepened pre\-existing audiences’ knowledge of James’s work and influenced others’ reading practices through innovative public events and media engagement. In particular, Horne has humanised James for modern audiences – presenting him as a biographical subject on one of BBC Radio 4’s flagship programmes, *Book of the Week*, and in articles in the *Times Literary Supplement* – and demonstrated his continuing contemporary vitality through public events commemorating the centenary of James’s death in 2016. 

 **Facilitating cultural production and generating new ways of thinking for writers** 

 Horne’s work on the manuscripts of James’s notebooks \[ **R4**\] has led to **the co\-production of a new cultural artefact**: *Tales from a Master’s Notebook* \[ **R5**\], an anthology of short stories written by contemporary novelists. His research, and the open approach he encouraged them to take as described in \[ **R5**\], influenced **the creative practice of the critically acclaimed and award\-winning contributors**: Susie Boyt; Amit Chaudhuri; Jonathan Coe; Giles Foden; Tessa Hadley; Joseph O’Neill; Colm Tóibin; Rose Tremain; Lynne Truss, and Paul Theroux. Many of the writers acknowledged the significance of the close relationship with James’s fiction made possible by Horne’s research \[ **R5**\]. Jonathan Coe found the process ‘made me think again about Henry James, a writer I don’t read often enough, yet whose influence on contemporary fiction of all kinds cannot be underestimated’ \( **A**\). For Joseph O’Neill, this was ‘an extraordinary opportunity to steal the ideas of a genius and put them to some use’. His story in \[ **R5**\], ‘The Poltroon Husband’, was serialised in *The New Yorker* \(12 March 2018\). Highlighting the significance of the opportunity to work with Horne as ‘the planet’s leading Henry James scholar’, O’Neill described how ‘Rifling through the ideas of an immortal as if they were one’s own is uncanny and exhilarating \[…\] James’s ideas are \[…\] packed with latent drama and very fresh’ \( **A**\). 

 Writing for *Tales* **provided some of these authors with an opportunity to experiment with a form they used less frequently**. For Jonathan Coe, for example, ‘Writing my story ‘Canadians Can’t Flirt’ \[…\] was an important experience for me. First of all, it made me attempt to write short\-form narrative, a form which I normally shy away from.’ It also **influenced the genesis of Coe’s critically acclaimed novel **Middle England**, which went on to win the 2020 Costa Book Award and the 2019 Prix du Livre Européen: ‘above all, it made me create two characters – most notably the fictitious English novelist Lionel Hampshire – who subsequently appeared in my novel *Middle England*, which would thereby have been a poorer and lesser book without the inspiration and stimulation that came from Phil’s commission’ \( **A**\). O’Neill attests to the **impact on his creative and teaching practice**, writing that ‘I wrote a story that would never otherwise have occurred to me; and I found the experience so valuable that I repeated the exercise with my writing students at Bard College’ \( **A**\). 

 It was also **an opportunity for writers to reflect on form and their own practice**: for Susie Boyt her involvement ‘not only deepened my understanding of Henry James’s short stories, it also made me think differently about the relationship of the short story to the novel both in James’s writing and my own. \[…\] The conversations that took place around the collection, with Philip Horne and some of the other contributors, were stimulating and illuminating. \[…\] Style is very important to me as a novelist, but attempting to produce well\-made prose that also feels contemporary is something I already struggle with so it was particularly useful to face this challenge head on’ \( **A**\). Tessa Hadley testifies that it was **a liberating experiment**: ‘The invitation to provide a story for \[ **R5**\] was an exciting opportunity to give license to the temptations that otherwise you're mostly holding off, as a writer. To try to feel yourself inside a story dreamed up by Henry James, to try to find some way of making sentences from that beginning which were your own and yet echoed the way his imagination might have moved around such a subject...  It was an exciting experiment in writing, broadening and liberating my own practice’ \( **A**\). 

 The short\-story collection has been described in the *Times Literary Supplement* \( *TLS*\) as ‘\[an\] ingenious and entertaining collection... the stories could not be more varied in tone and approach’, where ‘the appreciation of his unwritten tales by 11 fine contemporary authors pays handsome dividends’ \( *Sydney Review of Books*\) \(p.9 of **B**\). The book has sold over 1300 English\-language copies, and a Chinese translation came out in 2019 and has sold a further 1565. Horne also curated a feature in the *Guardian Review* to coincide with *Tales’*s release: ‘“Messy attics of the mind”: what’s inside a writer’s notebook?’ \(6 April 2018\), which has been shared 248 times online and included contributions from Horne and Boyt, Theroux and Chaudhuri who ‘muse\[d\] on their own use of notebooks and the Jamesian ideas that inspired them’, connecting for the reader Horne’s research to the practices of contemporary writers \(p.14 of **B**\). 

 Horne began the Henry James Reading Group in 2014, which led to this collection, and which has met 90 times across the impact period \(and has continued online through the Covid\-19 pandemic\). The reading group has generated **new ways of thinking that influence creative practice and benefit wellbeing and professional practice beyond the creative industries.** The group has approximately 100 members and meetings are usually attended by 15\-25 individuals. They include authors Hadley and Boyt, alongside journalists, lawyers and senior public servants. These sessions provide unusually fertile occasions for contemporary novelists to reflect on their own work as James\-inspired writers, as well as being an accessible and egalitarian forum for enhancing understanding among non\-academic audiences. In the *Guardian* Boyt described how such reading groups influenced her own creative practice: ‘For 25 years I have attended Henry James reading groups so his voice often appears \[in my notebooks\], almost casually, like a distinguished neighbour dropping round’ \(p.17 of **B**\). \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 **Enhancing public understanding of James’s work** 

 Horne demonstrates James’s continuing contemporary vitality and approachability, and has **changed how contemporary readers engaged with and commentators have responded to his works.** Horne contributed to a dozen events in 2016 to commemorate the centenary of James’s death which alongside his contributions to media coverage and original programming cumulatively reached an audience of at least 2,055,000. A talk based on \[ **R2**\] about the experimental nature of James’s autobiographies, given in February 2016 at the Grolier Club in New York, had received 3548 views on YouTube by 14/08/2020 \( **D**\). The most significant event Horne organised that year was ‘Henry James \(April 15, 1843–February 28, 1916\): A Commemoration on the centenary of his funeral’, which took place in the same place, Chelsea Old Church, 100 years later to the day, on 3 March 2016. Horne conceived the commemoration: he and Tessa Hadley spoke, while Simon Paisley Day, Miriam Margolyes, Olivia Williams, Alan Hollinghurst, and Oliver Herford gave readings. 140 attendees were introduced to passages from James’s Notebooks and fiction chosen by Horne; these drew upon his publications including \[ **R1**\] and \[ **R2**\]. Anthony Lane described in *The New Yorker* how ‘Spoken in public, \[…\] they make more immediate and graspable sense \[…\] Given that James, bewilderingly, dictated \[ *The Golden Bowl*\] in the first place, you could argue that to hear it aloud is somehow to restore the text to its original form’. For Lane, the readings recontextualised James’ fiction, demonstrating its relevance to audiences today: \[ *What Maisie Knew*\] ‘dispel\[led\] any lingering contention \[…\] that \[James\] neglected the issues of his day \[…\] Divorce and custody are the issues of *any* day, more so now than ever’ \(p.5 of **E**\). Michael Caines wrote in a *TLS* blog \(31 March 2016\): ‘I hope I'll remember \[this event\] for a long time to come, not least for \[…\] the excellent readings \[…\] When the soprano Anna Sideris stood in front of the altar to sing ""How beautiful it is"", from Benjamin Britten's operatic adaptation of *The Turn of Screw*, that clinched it. This was art apotheosized’ \( **E**\). 

 Horne’s regular contributions to broadcast and print media open up new ways of reading James for audiences invested in engaging with his novels. In the *TLS*, ‘A Last Wintering’ \(3 March 2016\), on James’s last illness, death and funeral, Horne introduced a wider audience to the themes of the commemorative event, bringing out how even after a stroke and in an often confused state the dying James retained his wit and imagination \(print circulation 45,000\). A podcast accompanying Horne’s later article ‘Sense of the West’ \( *TLS* 20 September 2018\) about Henry James’s 1905 visit to Los Angeles, which builds on \[ **R6**\], has had 6,253 listeners \( **F**\). In the week of the centenary of the funeral, BBC Radio 4 broadcast, ‘Book of the Week: The Real Henry James’ \(29 February to 4 March 2016\). Book of the Week had a 9.7% share of audience in the first quarter of 2016 \( **G**\). These five 15\-minute programmes in a prime slot introduced listeners to James’s lesser\-known non\-fiction writings and the insights these provide into British and American society of the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Horne conceived of and pitched the programme, wrote the scripts containing excerpts from letters, memoirs, essays and private notebooks \(informed by \[ **R2**\], \[ **R3**\], \[ **R4**\], \[ **R6**\]\), and was present for recording. The producer commented that Horne ‘used his extensive research into the journalism of Henry James to select fascinating material for a general audience \[which\] would only previously have been known to scholars. He produced a wealth of material and then worked with the producer to select passages which would work best for the Radio 4 programme. He wrote linking sections introducing James’s writings, giving context and explaining them. He also suggested the readers \[Henry Goodman and Olivia Williams\], whom he had worked with before, and they both agreed to do it because of his involvement. The programmes were highly praised by the commissioning editor at BBC Radio 4 and reached an estimated audience of 2,000,000’ \( **G**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The University of Bradford’s research into the systemic failure of Digital Government \(DG\) and Digital\-led Transformation efforts in Public Administration \(DTPA\) has been used extensively by governments in the UK and Internationally. The impact of this research is far reaching and has led to seismic changes in policy direction and current line of thinking on DTPA projects and DG implementation.  Underpinned by an alternative frame of reference for DTPA, the research, including written and oral evidence by Weerakkody to the 2018 parliamentary inquiry into Digital Government, has initiated the rethinking of approaches to several DTPA projects nationally and internationally, resulting in over GBP4,500,000 cost savings and improved outcomes for citizens. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research, conducted by Prof Vishanth Weerakkody \(2017 – present\), Paul Waller \(2017 – present\), Prof Zahir Irani \(2016 – present\) and Dr Amizan Omar \(2019 – present\)  challenges existing approaches to DG, which are heavily influenced by new public management concepts and overlaying commercial models into public administration \(PA\) to realise outcomes of transformation such as efficiency, cost savings and transparency of service. It questions how a PA, which is part of an elected decision\-making body for a community and whose role is to act on common answers to contested community issues through policy design, implementation, and administration \- can be transformed using information and communication technology \(ICT\). 

 The research has advanced the field of DG by postulating that government is not a ‘service industry’ and delineating the concept of a ‘service’ in a PA context \(1\). The research classifies interactions and transactions that take place between PA and citizens to provide a meaningful context for DG \(2\), provides evidence to explain the reasons for the failure of current approaches to DTPA and proposes an alternative frame of reference \(1\). The new frame of reference builds on closely aligning policy design with policy delivery instruments and how technology should be integrated within this context. In order to achieve transformation of PA processes through use of digital technologies, the research established that public administrations require a complete reversal of the current way of looking at DTPA \(2\). Instead of viewing transformation from the viewpoint of technology or the internet, PAs must start with the political process of policy design \(1\). In particular, they must look at how technology can change the range and characteristics of policy instruments — the tools that governments choose to intervene in the economy, society, and environment to make change, such as taxes, benefits, licences, information campaigns and more tangible things like public services and infrastructure \(2,3\). In this way, the research proposes a Frame of Reference which fundamentally rethinks the terminology, concepts and objects that enabled the examination of DTPA and associated DG efforts in government \(1\). 

 The Frame of Reference refocuses the use of ICT for DTPA from a private sector service centric perspective to using ICT to transform the implementation and administration of policy instruments \(1\). To examine how transformation of this nature might be achieved, it is necessary to address the potential impact of ICT on the choice and implementation of instruments during policy design, or re\-design \(2\). Drawing on the principles of public administration \(1\), our research provides the rationale for choosing or modifying instrument sets in favour of new, technology\-enabled ones which focuses on transforming three key areas: Demand Management, Administrative Burden Reduction, and Availability of public services. 

 While the research opens questions of an academic nature, they address societal, economic and policy issues and have a major impact on practice. The first is how policy designers make a choice between ICT\-enabled instruments to ensure the implementation of policy objectives and realisation of associated outcomes \(6\). The second is related and asks how the effectiveness of an implemented policy is measured to determine if it achieved its objectives \(2, 3, 5\). The third is about how ‘best’ or ‘good’ practice is shared and adopted \(or adapted\) \(5\) when as described earlier, instrument selection and implementation involves political choices that are highly sensitive to the political, cultural, social, economic, and environmental context within which they are made \(4\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Policy Impact** 

 Our research has influenced policy by exposing the current flaws in a\) methodologies applied in DTPA; b\) how concepts and terminology are defined in a DG context, and c\) how instruments used for delivering DTPA and DG are looked at \(1\). Raised awareness has placed policy makers and practitioners, including UK Government Digital Services \(GDS\), in a better position to refocus and avoid the same mistakes to improve public sector project delivery and DTPA efforts \(2\). As outlined by the society for innovation, technology and modernisation \(SOCITM\), “ *several advisors of SOCITM have referenced your work and used your research in our policy briefings to influence policy makers at various levels of the public sector*” \(3\). The Deputy Ambassador of State of Qatar in Washington DC states that our research has “ *helped the foreign mission towards transition from traditional to digital diplomacy… Since 2019, we have undertaken a review and transformation of both internal back office and external diplomatic activities based on your research into ICT enhanced instruments… and…. during the Covid\-19 crisis, this has ensuring that Qatar’s diplomatic functions continue to operate effectively in the digital world”* \(4\). 

 Challenging that the “digital by default” mantra in the UK has no reference to what governments and public bodies actually do and how they do it, our research has created impact by postulating a frame of reference to DTPA that reverses the current model \(and way of thinking\) \(9\). This was achieved by placing the emphasis on how technology can modify policy instruments selected in the policy design process and thus aligning it with policy reform rather than on private sector norms as practiced by GDS \(1, 5\).  The National Audit Office \(NAO\) Executive Director’s testimonial states, “ *your work in the field of digital transformation has been extremely helpful in my work and review of ongoing projects. In particular our work on Digital transformation in government \(HC 1059, 2016\-17\) considered how government could improve its approach to managing transformation. …The impact of the NAO’s work on digital transformation has led to a large number of recommendations accepted by government”* \(2\) *.*  The London Borough of K&C \(LBKC\) Councillor cites the example of a project where he led the effort to issue 50 iPads to council officers resulting in positive impacts for the community and confirms that “… *I was able to make better informed decisions to connect technology with policy outcomes…*” \(6\). 

 **Socio\-Economic Impact** 

 The evidence provided to the House of Commons on the Universal Credit \(UC\) system \(1a\) and to the Australian Senate Committee on DG \(7\) focused on identifying problems with the current approach to DTPA that have resulted in causing both financial and social hardship to ordinary citizens. This research has shown that whilst the aims of UC are laudable, the design of the instruments of policy implementation, the conception of the project to implement them, and the execution of the project have been done in the worst possible way. The visible effects reported in evidence to the Parliamentary Committee are symptoms \(1a\), but the causes lie deep and tweaks to the current system are unlikely to improve matters as highlighted during the Covid\-19 crisis. Based on our research, parliamentary \(1b\) and senate committees \(7\), local government officials \(6, 8, 9\), councillors \(6\), professional bodies \(3, 10\), heads of department in national government institutions \(2\) and ambassadors in diplomatic missions \(4\) were influenced to rethink their approach to DTPA efforts. Consequently, these policy\-decision makers have been impelled to use our research \- resulting in the creation of public value and cost savings to the taxpayer as a result of influencing DTPA project outcomes.  LBKS states that successful integration of technology at the council “… *have been influenced by your work and resulted in real impact and ensured public value and return on investment for the taxpayer*” \(6\). 

 In the UK, DTPA efforts totalling £2 billion were cancelled or failed to deliver expected outcomes during the past decade \(National Audit Office\). Prominent DTPA failures include: C\-Nomis project for offenders \(home office and ministry of justice\), e\-Borders system, BBC digital and video archives system, National Health Service’s Programme for IT \(NPfIT\), the Universal Credit and Common Agricultural Policy Delivery Programme \(House of Commons, 2017; 2019\). Our research continues to influence the trajectory of DTPA to avoid such failures, thus creating real impact through cost savings to the taxpayer \(2, 8\). As outlined by the Head of Productivity at Local Government Association \(LGA\), “ *as well as significantly improving how services are designed and delivered online for citizens and businesses, digital\-led projects enable staff and members to work more effectively both in and out of the office*”. “ *The estimated savings from these programmes are currently in excess of £4.5 million*” \(8\). The longitudinal impact of our research beyond the 2017\-20 period is highlighted by the Head of Productivity in LGA who states, “ *it is estimated that over the next three\-year period, five councils involved in digital transformation efforts linked to homeless reduction act of 2017 will collectively make over £430,000 of non\-financial savings*” \(8\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Solar Combined Heat and Power \(CHP\) is an attractive way to provide renewable energy in the domestic and small business sectors, but the large size of existing systems is not appropriate for these settings. Northumbria University has advanced technology by developing a novel system for a smaller, cost\-effective, and more efficient micro CHP plant through the EUR3,999,383 *Innova MicroSolar* project. Four European industrial partners in this project gained technological and commercial benefits by developing new product lines, including the smallest Organic Rankine Cycle turbine in the world. The companies also expanded their markets, and created over 10 new jobs. As of December 2020, two micro CHP plants have been installed in Pula \(Italy\) and Almatret \(Spain\). In Almatret, the plant has been installed in a hostel that accommodates up to 45 eco\-tourists per day, and provides \[text removed for publication\] of the hot water demand and approximately \[text removed for publication\] of the building’s energy, reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by approximately 9 tons annually. This has also enabled the local community to achieve its long\-term goal of becoming a centre for eco\-tourism.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The European Union’s \(EU\) strategic energy objectives identified solar energy as a feasible pathway to energy security with reduced environmental impact. Previously, a limited number of engineering solutions for solar residential and small business technologies existed, with a Combined Heat and Power \(CHP\) system proposed as one of the candidates. Most CHP technologies were of two types: \(i\) very large\-scale plants, with complex solar collectors and several megawatt turbines for the production of electricity, or \(ii\) small\-scale systems designed to satisfy only domestic hot water requirements. Hence, there was an untapped market for a novel micro CHP system that could be applied in domestic and small business sectors, and that would cover power and heat demands. 

 To develop the novel technology, Professor Khamid Mahkamov and his research team at Northumbria University created the conceptual design of the *Innova MicroSolar* CHP plant, rationalised separate components of the plant, and configured the whole plant as a system by means of numerical mathematical modelling. The team also participated in the experimental tests of both the individual components and the whole plant itself, including demonstrating the technical\-economic advantages that could be achieved in a real environment. 

 In 2014, Mahkamov investigated the practicality of deploying different technologies for the provision of energy to buildings \[ **R1**\]. Once the practicality of the technologies had been demonstrated theoretically, Mahkamov identified industrial partners to realise the concept in practice: AAVID Thermacore Europe Ltd, Enogia, Elianto CSP, and STRATEGIE SRL. 

 In 2016, Mahkamov’s research team and the industrial partners secured a EUR3,999,383 Horizon 2020 project ‘The Innovative Micro Solar Heat and Power System for Domestic and Small Business Residential Buildings’ \[ **G1**\], or *Innova MicroSolar*. The *Innova MicroSolar* plant was configured around a solar field made of Fresnel mirrors, that were used to heat thermal oil to a temperature of about 240° C. This thermal energy was then used to run a 2\-kWel Organic Rankine Cycle \(ORC\) turbine and charge a Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage \(LHTES\) unit with Phase Change Material \(PCM\). The LHTES extended the operational hours of the ORC turbine into the evening\-time, when the sun was down. The heat rejected in the ORC condenser was used for hot water production and space heating. Finally, a smart control unit optimised the operation of the whole system with minimal user intervention \[ **R2**\]. 

 A series of experimental investigations were run at Northumbria to develop the PCM composite with required properties to be used in the LHTES. A wide range of organic and inorganic materials, and their combinations, were investigated \[ **R3**\] and their thermo\-physical properties were measured. Compounds made of potassium nitrate \(KNO<sub>3</sub>\) and sodium nitrate \(NaNO<sub>3</sub>\) salts were selected for further refining. A new compound was created \(50% KNO<sub>3</sub> \+ 50% NaNO<sub>3</sub>\) to achieve the required melting point and maintain the highest possible heat of fusion \(220.9° C and 98 kJ/kg\). The method of enhancement of thermal conductivity of the PCMs, developed at Northumbria during the EU\-funded ENTAS project \[ **G2**\], was applied to the developed new compound \[ **R4**\]. The enhancement was achieved by adding a particular type of expanded graphite at a specific concentration to avoid compound separation. 

 Advanced 3D numerical mathematical modelling of the operation of each main component was performed at Northumbria to find their rational design and optimised physical dimensions. Based on the results of simulations, design documentation was produced for the main parts of the plant and laboratory tests were run, led by the Northumbria team. For example, a combination of theoretical and experimental investigations were carried out to determine the design parameters of the LHTES with bi\-directional heat pipes \[ **R5**\]. 

 The plant field test results were used for the analysis \(mathematical simulations\) of energy and carbon savings for locations across Europe with variable climates \[ **R6**\]. The micro CHP plant proved to be highly competitive in comparison with other renewable energy technologies. The achievable energy and operational cost savings through the proposed plant with respect to traditional technologies were assessed. This analysis showed that the proposed plant could satisfy \~80% of the overall energy demand of a 100 m<sup>2</sup> dwelling in southern Europe, and could satisfy \~34% of the overall energy demand in the worst\-case scenario in northern Europe. The corresponding operational cost savings amounted to 87% and 33%, respectively.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Northumbria University's research in the EUR3,999,383 *Innova MicroSolar* project was used to develop, optimise, test, and install two micro CHP plants. This project enabled the four industrial partners \(AAVID Thermacore Europe Ltd, Enogia, Elianto CSP, and STRATEGIE SRL\) to develop new, or improve existing components manufactured for the plant \[ **E1**, p60\-66\], bringing commercial and technological benefits to these companies. The new plants led to improvements in efficiency, cost\-effectiveness, and environmental advantages. 

 **4.1 AAVID Thermacore Europe Ltd \(UK\). Development of two new products: bi\-directional heat pipes and 220° C PCM LHTES** 

###  AAVID Thermacore Europe Ltd is a leading supplier of products for the thermal\-management industry with a turnover of GBP5,760,357 \(2017\). As a result of working with Northumbria, ‘ *Aavid Thermacore was able to create two new products, namely high\-temperature bi\-directional heat pipes and the LHTES accumulating and discharging the thermal energy at temperature levels of 220*° *C and higher’* \[E2, see also E1, p12\-14\]. The collaboration resulted in improved components, for example the heat pipes increase the rate of charging and discharging of the thermal storage by about 30% and reduce its dimensions by 20% \[E2\]. This led to reduced thermal loss, resulting in improved efficiency. David Mullen, Project Engineering Manager at AAVID Thermacore Europe Ltd stated: *‘There is a strong interest from our partners for these products, especially the developed high\-temperature heat pipes, and the company increased its turnover by up to 10% over the last year as additional R&D funding was generated to adapt the new products to specific requirements of our clients’* \[E2\]. In 2019\-2020, AAVID employed two new engineers and one new technician \(Headcount: 3\) to work specifically on new orders related to *Innova MicroSolar* products \[E2\]. 

 **4.2 Enogia \(France\). Development of a new product: 2\-kWel ORC Turbine package** 

 Enogia is an Organic Rankine Cycle \(ORC\) turbine manufacturer specialising in waste heat recovery. Northumbria University conducted 3D modelling of the mass and heat transfer processes and flow of the two\-phase working fluid through the elements of the ORC for many combinations of configurations and design layouts with various dimensions \[ **E1**, p61\-63\]. Andre\-Charles Mintsa, Enogia’s Senior Project Manager stated: *‘As a result of the research support from Professor Mahkamov’s team, Enogia successfully developed a new product, namely         2\-kWel ORC turbine – the smallest ORC turbine in the world’* \[ **E3**\]. 

 Enogia is now using this product in different small\-scale applications. There has been strong interest from partners wanting to trial the new product and so the research and development funding of the company increased by 30% between 2018 and 2020 \[text removed for publication\]. Enogia also employed three additional engineers \(Headcount: 3\) to support this new product line \[ **E3**\]. It has attracted interest for application not only in micro CHP plants but also in the automotive and power industries for harnessing energy from exhaust gases from engines, gas turbines, and burners. Andre\-Charles Mintsa, Enogia’s Senior Project Manager, reported: *‘We are adapting the design of this ORC turbine for application with* \[text removed for publication\] *diesel engines to utilise waste energy of exhaust from engines and increase overall fuel efficiency.* \[text removed for publication\] *’* \[ **E3**\]. 

 **4.3 Elianto CSP \(Italy\). Optimisation of Linear Fresnel Solar Concentrating Field** 

 Northumbria University worked with Elianto CSP to improve the optical performance of their Fresnel mirrors, refining the outline of the solar field and geometry of mirrors to increase the concentration ratio of the optical system by 24%. This enabled the dimensions of the Fresnel mirror solar field and associated components to be reduced, while maintaining the high thermal output at a temperature of 280° C \[ **E4**\]. This design improvement made the solar collector system more adaptable to roof mounting because of its \~25% smaller footprint and \~30% reduced weight. Moreover, the production and installation costs for the new design of the solar field were reduced by up to 32%. 

 This refined design has brought direct economic benefits, as Piero Pili, CEO of Elianto CSP, stated: *‘The new concentrating solar collector proved to be very competitive on the market, leading to a sharp increase in product demand. In 2020, Elianto sold several thousand primary reflective mirrors of the refined design and resultant turnover has increased by 26% in 2020 in comparison to the 2016\-2019 period.* *This innovation provided Elianto CSP with the new competitive edge on the market, with current negotiations with owners of seven new installations across Europe’* \[ **E4**\]. As well as these direct commercial benefits, research and development income doubled from \[text removed for publication\] in 2018 to \[text removed for publication\] in 2020. To meet demand for the new product the company also employed an additional three engineers \(Headcount:3\) \[ **E4**\]. 

 **4.4 STRATEGIE SRL \(Italy\). New product: smart control unit** 

 Northumbria University’s research on the optimisation of the whole plant's operation, through a strategy of dynamic interlinking of the components \[ **R1**, **R3**\] resulted in a new product line being created by STRATEGIE SRL – a new smart control unit \[ **E1**, p63\-65\]. This product *‘ensures dynamic interactions of all components through monitoring parameters of heat transfer fluids used in the plant, energy flow distributions between plant’s sub\-systems and measuring their performance… \[The product was developed\] to govern plants with the latent heat thermal storage \[LHTES\], and in according with customers’ feedback, it increases the renewable energy utilisation factor and overall efficiency of such plants by 10\-15%*’ \[ **E5**\]. 

 The new smart control unit has attracted significant interest in the sector and was incorporated into the company’s solutions for customers in the gas industry and the renewable energy technologies sector. Carlo Maria Bartolini, Chairman of STRATEGIE SRL, stated: *‘The new product increased STRATEGIE SRL’s turnover by 25% over the last two years \[2018\-2020\], and the number of engineers \[Headcount: more than 1\] was considerably increased from 2018 to 2020 to cope with the new business… Innova MicroSolar project considerably strengthened our business contacts with other companies across the EU, which was also very beneficial for the STRATEGIE’s business’* \[ **E5**\]. 

 **4.5 Local authorities adopted **Innova MicroSolar** plants to meet green energy goals** 

 As of December 2020, two *Innova MicroSolar* plants have been installed and are providing heat and power to a secondary school and the local stadium in Pula, Sardinia, Italy \[ **E6**\], and to a hostel in Almatret, Catalonia, Spain \[ **E7**\]. Ferro Tecnica Impianti SRL is an Italian company that builds renewable energy plants across Europe, and they used the micro CHP technology to build the system in Pula. The cost savings and the smaller size of the *Innova MicroSolar* plant make the system extremely attractive to domestic and small business sectors and, as a result, Ferro Tecnica Impianti SRL have committed to building another plant in Ottana, Sardinia \[ **E6**\]. 

 In 2020, Spain passed legislation that requires clean energy sources to make up at least 70% of electricity, and requires that energy consumption is reduced by at least 35%, primarily through the renovation of buildings and homes. The municipality of Almatret decided to make the village into a destination for eco\-tourism, and invested EUR40,000 from its budget to install *Innova MicroSolar* to support the energy needs of a new hostel that accommodates up to 45 eco\-tourists per day. Since 2018, the plant has provided \[text removed for publication\] of the hot water demand and approximately \[text removed for publication\] of the building’s total energy needs, reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by approximately 9 tonnes annually \[ **E7**\]. Jordi Tarrago Jove, Mayor President of the municipality of Almatret, stated: *‘Achieving this would not have been possible without the contribution of Northumbria University. It enabled our community to achieve long\-term goals of becoming a centre for eco\-tourism’* \[ **E7**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research has shown that regular consumption of sugar\-sweetened drinks leads to obesity and overweight in both children and adults, as well as increasing tooth decay. Obesity reduces life expectancy and increases the chance of serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes, and has also been linked to worse outcomes from COVID\-19. University of Oxford research contributed directly to the introduction of sugary drinks taxes in the UK, Ireland and Mexico and indirectly to the introduction of similar taxes around the world. The UK and Mexico taxes have already led to demonstrated reductions in the sale of sugary drinks and levels of sugar consumption from these products. Modelling studies based on these results indicate that the resulting health benefits are significant, including reduced incidence of obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Overweight and obesity are estimated to account for about 4,000,000 deaths annually worldwide. Obesity is a major cause of diabetes, which is currently estimated to affect 450,000,000 people worldwide \(1 in 11 adults\) but this is expected to rise to more than 700,000,000 by 2045 as obesity rates continue to increase. Consequently, there is an urgent need for comprehensive national policies aimed at restricting the major environmental determinants of obesity. 

 Research led by Professor Jonathan Emberson generated clear evidence of the increasing burden of obesity and of type 2 diabetes in Mexico. The Mexico City Prospective Study \(MCPS\) was initiated in 1994 by Oxford researchers Professor Sir Richard Peto and Professor Sir Rory Collins in collaboration with epidemiologists in Mexico \(Professor Roberto Tapia\-Conyer, Professor Pablo Kuri\-Morales and Doctor Jesus Alegre\-Diaz\). Professor Emberson joined the team in 2004 and has been the UK Principal Investigator of the study since 2013.The MCPS represents a long\-standing collaboration between researchers at the University of Oxford and researchers at the Mexican Ministry of Health and the National Autonomous University of Mexico \(Mexico City\). Between 1998 and 2004, 150,000 people aged 35 years or older from Mexico City were recruited, interviewed, had measurements and a blood sample taken, and then followed for cause\-specific mortality. The University of Oxford researchers designed the questionnaire used in the baseline assessment, assessed the blood samples collected and analysed the data. By the early 2010s, the study was starting to generate reliable evidence regarding the major causes of premature death in Mexico. In 2016, the study showed that diabetes was responsible for twice as many Mexican deaths as had previously been thought based on studies undertaken in higher income countries \[1\]. By 60 to 74 years of age, approximately one quarter of the participants in the cohort had a medical diagnosis of diabetes \(compared with approximately 7% in an equivalent population in the UK\) and diabetes accounted for over a third \(35%\) of all deaths between 35 and 74 years of age. 

 In parallel, University of Oxford researchers developed population simulation models to predict the impact of health\-related food taxation policies and possible industry responses in various countries including the UK \[2, 3, 4, 5\], Ireland \[6\], New Zealand and Denmark. These models incorporated data on sales and consumption of unhealthy foods \(high in sugar, salt or saturated fat\), price elasticity estimates, and estimates of the association between unhealthy foods and disease outcomes. Collectively, these studies indicated that taxing unhealthy food products could be an effective method to reduce the prevalence of obesity and obesity\-related disease outcomes, including type 2 diabetes. In response to a lack of UK data on the possible consequences of a sugary drinks tax, University of Oxford researchers led a study in collaboration with Reading University to develop a model to estimate the effects of a 20% sugary drinks tax on UK purchasing habits, obesity, and expenditure by income \[4\]. The Oxford researchers designed the study, planned the analyses, built the comparative risk assessment model and published the results. Reading University researchers conducted the econometric work necessary to produce a bespoke price elasticity matrix. The model predicted that once the full effect of the tax was borne out, the prevalence of obesity in adults in the UK would decrease by 1.3% \(180,000 people\), compared with the situation if the tax had not been introduced. The Oxford researchers then collaborated with the University of Dublin to conduct a similar study for the Irish Government, with comparable results for Ireland \[6\]. 

 Between 2013 and the announcement, by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, of a Soft Drinks Industry Levy for the UK in 2016, University of Oxford researchers  developed further evidence to evaluate the effects of health\-related food taxes,  for example by addressing concerns raised by the Institute of Fiscal Studies’ about the efficacy of a sugary drinks tax. In response to the announcement of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy, the researchers developed a bespoke model to understand the impact of different industry responses \(e.g. reformulation vs price changes\) on obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay \[5\]. This model indicated that the most effective industry response would be widespread reformulation of sugary drinks, which would significantly decrease the incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as reducing the number of decayed, missing, or filled teeth annually.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The University of Oxford’s research into health\-related food and drink taxes has had significant international impact, contributing directly to the introduction of sugary drinks taxes in Mexico \(2014\), the UK \(2018\) and Ireland \(2018\) and influencing the introduction of similar taxes around the world. By December 2020, according to the World Cancer Research Fund, there were sugary drinks taxes in 38 countries \[A\]. 

####  A. Creating a favourable policy environment for new sugary drinks taxes 

 **Mexico:** For over 20 years the University of Oxford has worked closely with researchers in Mexico including \(during the period 2011 \- 2018\) the Undersecretary of Prevention and Health Promotion of the Mexican Ministry of Health. As testified by the Undersecretary, this close collaboration and discussion of the research evidence meant that ‘ *even before results were published, the findings from the Mexico City Prospective Study influenced health policy decision making in matters related to non\-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. In particular, the study influenced both the decision in 2014 to introduce taxes on sugary drinks and the declaration in 2016 of diabetes and obesity as epidemiologic emergencies \(the first time this had been done for non\-communicable diseases\)’* \[B\]. The 2016 declaration led to the introduction of a wide range of health policies aimed at tackling and treating obesity and diabetes, including healthy eating, on\-pack labelling, medical check\-ups and physical activity. The introduction of the sugary drinks tax in Mexico was the catalyst for similar adoptions by other countries, as acknowledged by international agencies: *‘The passage, implementation and subsequent evaluation of Mexico’s SSB \(Sugar sweetened beverage\) tax \(implemented 1 January 2014\) acted as a tipping point for global action’,* World Cancer Research Fund International \[C\]. 

 **UK:** The introduction of a sugary drinks tax in Mexico led to the proposal among UK policy makers for a similar tax for Britain. One of the UK modelling studies conducted by Oxford University \[4\] was cited in Public Health England \(PHE\)’s policy document **‘** *Sugar reduction, Responding to the challenge’* \[D\] \(June 2014\) In their subsequent report ‘ *Sugar Reduction, The evidence for action*’ \[D\] \(October 2015\) PHE specifically recommended the introduction of ‘ *a price increase of a minimum of 10\-20% on high sugar products through the use of a tax or levy such as on full sugar soft drinks, based on the emerging evidence of the impact of such measures in other countries*.’ 

 The recommendation from PHE was discussed during the UK Parliamentary Health Select Committee’s inquiry into childhood obesity in October 2015. Professors Susan Jebb and Peter Scarborough presented oral evidence to the committee, which included discussing the evidence from Mexico which indicated that such a tax would be effective in the UK. The resulting report ‘ *Childhood obesity – brave and bold action’* \(November 2015\) \[E\] recommended a sugary drinks tax in the UK and stated that ‘ *The evidence suggests that increasing the price of high sugar products by 10–20% or more through the use of a tax or levy would be likely to have an effect on purchasing behaviour and therefore sugar consumption at least in the short term’*. During a debate in Parliament on this recommendation \(November 2015\), the Chair of the Select Committee \(Sarah Wollaston MP\), said, ‘ *We know from the experience in Mexico that a 10% levy on sugary drinks has led to a 6% reduction in consumption’* \[F\]. 

 This report had a direct impact on the opinions of MPs, who then spoke in support of the tax in Parliament in November 2015 \[F\]: 

-  *‘During the Select Committee’s inquiry, we heard some compelling evidence calling for brave and bold action on obesity…A few months ago I was against a sugary drinks tax, because I am against extra taxation, but the compelling evidence that we heard changed my mind.’* 

 MP for Erewash, Maggie Throup 

-  *‘Following the introduction of the tax on sugar\-sweetened drinks \(in Mexico\), purchases were reduced by 6% in 2014. We need to be aware of the evidence showing that a tax will actually reduce the purchases of sugary drinks’,* MP for Heywood and Middleton, Liz McInnes 

-  *‘As I have looked into the issue more and more, I have reached the position where I find the evidence compelling: something needs to be done.’*  MP for St Austell and Newquay, Steve Double. 

 This increased political support, coupled with greater public acceptance \(described below\), led to the announcement of the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy \(SDIL\) in March 2016. 

 **Ireland:** The publication of the modelling studies \[2\] and \[3\] led to the researchers being commissioned by the Irish Government’s Department of Health in 2011 to carry out a modelling study of a 10% tax. This was incorporated within a health impact assessment \(HIA\) published by the Irish Institute of Public Health in 2012 and then subsequently in BMC Public Health \[6\]. This led to a recommendation by the Department of Health for the introduction of ‘ *a graded tax on pre\-packaged \[sugar\-sweetened soft drinks\] on sale in Ireland’* in 2016 \[G\]. As supporting evidence, the Department of Health referenced the HIA: *‘\[the HIA\] found evidence that ‘taxation could work to reduce overweight and obesity’ depending on the level of tax imposed…\[and\] concluded that a 10% tax on the price of SSDs \[sugary drinks\] would reduce obesity by 1.25% among adults in Ireland’* \[G\]. The recommendation for a tax was acted upon by the Irish Government, which introduced a tax in April 2018. 

 **International:** The success of the tax on sugary drinks in Mexico influenced WHO’s stance on using fiscal measures to reduce sugar consumption \[H\]. In their influential report ‘ *Tackling NCDs \(Noncommunicable Diseases\): Best Buys’* \[H\], WHO includes as a ‘best buy’ policy recommendation: ‘ *Reduce sugar consumption through effective taxation on sugar\-sweetened beverages.’* This report has contributed to the roll out of sugary drinks taxation policies worldwide. The World Cancer Research Fund tracks international food policies and currently notes sugary drinks taxes 39 countries including 10 in Europe \[A\]. Of these, 37 have been implemented since the introduction of the tax in Mexico in 2014, with many countries citing evidence of the link between sugar consumption, weight gain, overweight and obesity as a driving factor. 

####  B. Changing public attitudes towards sugary drinks taxes 

 The work of the researchers resulted in extensive media attention and public discussion of the issue. For example, Professor Mike Rayner appeared in BBC2’s Trust Me I’m a Doctor \(2014\) in a feature exploring the health impacts of excess sugar. Professor Rayner was also interviewed in Jamie Oliver’s Sugar Rush Documentary \(2015\) which was viewed by over 1.2M people in the UK. The celebrity chef Jamie Oliver subsequently went on to be a key advocate for a sugary drinks tax in the UK, contributing to the adoption of the tax by the UK Government and public acceptance. Increased general awareness of the health impacts of sugar led to greater public acceptance of a tax on sugary drinks. In 2013 only about 36% of people in the UK supported the introduction of a tax on sugary drinks. By 2015 this had risen to around 58%, but by March 2016, just after the sugary drinks tax had been announced, 69% supported the introduction \[I\]. 

####  C.  Industry responses and product reformulation 

 The SDIL succeeded in prompting widespread product reformulation. All major brands of soft drinks \(including supermarket brands\) launched new sugar\-free versions. This increased access to low\-sugar drinks and allowed consumers to reduce their sugar consumption without compromising their preferences or brand loyalties. In an evaluation of the UK SDIL, the Oxford University researchers demonstrated that the proportion of soft drinks containing >5g/100ml of sugar available on the UK market fell from 49% in 2015 to 15% in 2019 \[J\]. In addition, the majority of new products had a sugar level between 4.5 and 5.0 g per 100 mL, suggesting they the 5.0g threshold of the levy had guided the reformulation. In contrast, drinks exempt from the SDIL \(such as 100% fruit juice and milk\-based drinks\), saw no reduction in average sugar content, reinforcing that the levy was the motivating factor for change \[J\]. 

####  D. Impacts on sugar consumption and health 

 A review by Public Health England \(PHE\) in October 2020 concluded that between 2015 and 2019 in England, there was a 43.7% reduction in the total sugar content per 100ml for retailer and manufacturer branded drinks subject to the SDIL \[K\]. This meant that although sales in all soft drinks increased by 14.9% during this time, the total sugar purchased per household from drinks subject to the SDIL decreased across all socio\-economic groups \(between 38.5% \- 35.1%\). Reduced purchasing of sugar ultimately led to reduced sugar consumption. An analysis conducted by the University of Oxford researchers found that between 2015 and 2018, total sugar consumption from soft drinks declined by 29% despite soft drink consumption rising during this period. Further preliminary results of the evaluation of the levy indicate that compared to the pre\-announcement, the amount of sugar purchased in drinks by a household each week reduced by 29.5g \(9.8%\) one year after the introduction of the levy. The 2017 modelling study \[5\] suggested that the observed reformulation and reduced sugar consumption due to the levy will ultimately result in 140,000 fewer people with obesity and 19,000 fewer incident cases of type 2 diabetes per year in the UK, as well as nearly 270,000 fewer decayed, missing, or filled teeth annually. According to PHE data, the number of 0\-5 year olds being admitted to hospital in England for tooth extractions fell by 20.9% between 2014/15 \(16,591\) and 2018/19 \(13,120\). Between April\-October 2018, the levy raised almost GBP154,000,000 for programmes to support pupil health and well\-being, including primary physical education and the Healthy Pupils Capital Fund. 

 An evaluation of the tax in Mexico \(introduced in 2014\) shows that purchases of taxed beverages fell by 7.6%, between 2014 and 2016 \[L\]. In a modelling study, the Oxford University researchers estimated that this would lead to a projected reduction in new cases of diabetes by 189,300 for the time period 2013 to 2022, amounting to total savings between USD769million to USD1.2billion in direct healthcare costs.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Market\-centred policies, widely implemented across the world since the 1990s, have often caused or worsened extreme inequalities and injustices in the access to water sources and essential water and sanitation services \(WSS\). Professor Castro’s research during 2005\-2016 investigated these policies, their effects, and conflicts and opportunities arising from them. The findings and recommendations have helped legislators, politicians, workers’ unions, and civil society organizations in Latin America to stop or amend legislation aimed at privatizing WSS, proposing the remunicipalization of privatized WSS, and to propose a national water law. It has also helped an international federation of trade unions to strengthen its political influence, transform practices, and enhance their effectiveness in campaigning. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Castro’s research focused on Europe and Latin America. Bringing together historical, development, political, and environmental sociology it made a major contribution by introducing a social sciences approach in a field dominated by technical disciplines. The research focused on conflicts arising from the extreme inequalities and injustices in the access to water and sanitation services \(WSS\) and the management of water resources. Early work showed that restricted access to water cannot be explained by natural water scarcity or lack of technology, as prevailing arguments have suggested \(PUB1\). It also examined the implementation of market\-centred policy solutions to these problems, such as the privatization of WSS and the commodification of water resources since the 1990s \(PUB2, 4\). The research showed that these policy interventions have worsened the democratic deficit, increased inequality and injustice, and bear much of the responsibility for the failure of developing countries to meet the 2015 Millennium Development Goals. It demonstrated that the “water crisis” is a crisis of democracy \(PUB7\). The research thoroughly examined the initiatives of community organizations, civil society groups, trade unions, and other actors that react against these inequalities and injustices, demand the reversal of market\-centred policies, and propose alternative solutions. They demand the democratization of  public institutions responsible for WSS and water resources, greater democratic control by citizens and users, and a radical revision of legal and policy frameworks in the water sector \(PUB1\-3, 7\). 

 Castro’s work led to a set of key findings: 

-  Democratizing the water sector requires effective legal and administrative mechanisms to allow meaningful involvement of citizen\-users and to make these activities subject to democratic scrutiny and control \(PUB1, 2, 7\). 

-  The provision of essential WSS cannot be organized as a profit\-making activity. Governments and international institutions should stop promoting market\-centred solutions and enforce legal and policy mechanisms preventing them \(PUB2\-4\). 

-  The universalization of essential WSS requires heavy state involvement and public funding. The investments must privilege long\-term social “returns” \(in public health, quality of life, etc.\) over short\-term economic gains \(PUB6\). 

-  Public, particularly local authorities, must be strengthened to deliver and regulate WSS and the sustainable management of water resources. Instead of marked\-centred solutions like public\-private partnerships, there must be support for public\-public, public\-community, and community\-community partnerships to tackle the crisis \(PUB6\). 

 During 2009\-2011, Grant 1 allowed the consolidation of the WATERLAT\-GOBACIT Network \( [www.waterlat.org](http://www.waterlat.org/)\). It became a hub for research, teaching and training, and a solid platform for achieving impact beyond academia, and includes in its membership an international federation of trade unions. The Network also led to the DESAFIO project \(2013\-2015\) \(Grant 2\), which looked at socio\-technical innovations to tackle injustice and inequality in WSS in Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Castro’s research has been taken up by local, national, and international trade unions, parliamentarians and government officials, and civil society organizations. 

 **Strengthening Trade Union Political Influence and Campaigning Against Water Privatization** 

 A principal vehicle for the impact of Castro’s research has been The Public Services International \(PSI\), a global federation of 700 trade unions representing over 30 million workers from 154 countries. In 2014, the PSI became a member of the WATERLAT\-GOBACIT Research Network \(GRANT1\), and in March 2015 Castro signed a Cooperation Agreement \( **IMP1b**\) with the PSI to develop joint activities, which include training for union members. One activity has been a Specialization Course on Water Politics and Management organized and directed by Castro, drawing extensively on his research \(PUB1\-7\), which was taken by labour union leaders from Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru \(2019\-2020\) \( **IMP1a, IMP1d**\). At a public event in 2019 where the PSI’s General Secretary and Professor Castro signed an extension of the Agreement for an additional three\-year period, the General Secretary stated that the contributions made by Castro’s work “helped us not only to develop initiatives and campaigns but also to get theoretical support for our PSI practices in defending water services” \( **IMP1c, IMP1e**\). 

 In a video interview, PSI’s Sub\-Regional Secretary for Mexico, Central America, Panama, Dominican Republic, and Cuba, also stated that “for us, WATERLAT, and in particular the work of Esteban Castro, has \[…\] helped us to reconceptualize our role as workers unions \[… and\] enhanced not just our organizational capacities but also our impact and political influence” \( **IMP2a**\). The Sub\-Regional Secretary provided a testimonial stating that Castro’s “contributions not only allowed us to broaden our understanding of the problems we face, but also to achieve a better grasp of our field of intervention and extend our alliances with other progressive social actors, strengthen our arguments, and develop more effective practices in our campaigns”. As one example of these achievements, he referred to “cooperation agreements established between labour unions of public and community water and sanitation utilities in Colombia, Peru, Brazil and several Central American countries”. He also gave the example of the course organized by Castro, which “was taken by senior members of some of our affiliates in Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Mexico, who have praised its quality, have greatly benefited from it, and have requested that we establish it as a formal Specialization Course” \( **IMP2b**\). The Sub\-Regional Secretary added that “the research has also contributed to reinforce our democratic struggle against the privatization of water and sanitation services” **\(IMP2b\)**. 

 For instance, in 2017, the Workers Union of Santiago's Water and Sanitation Utility \(SITRACORAASAN\), a PSI\-affiliated trade union in the Dominican Republic, campaigned to stop legislation aimed at privatizing WSS in the country **\(IMP5a\-b\)**. Although previously unaware of his contribution, Castro’s research \(PUB5\) was extensively cited in the campaign. The union’s Secretary General explained this was because of the research’s “evidence based, irrefutable conclusions and direct relevance to the contents of the several water law projects being discussed in the Dominican Republic.” \( **IMP5a**\). In a video interview offered in December 2018, the union’s Secretary General also stated: “we have read \[Castro’s\] work and took it as our point of reference \[…\] it was very useful to raise awareness among the population and in persuading the government about the damaging, harmful consequences of privatization” **\(IMP5b**\). Following the campaign, the law project was put on hold and the privatization plans were postponed. 

 **Shaping Trade Union and Parliamentarian Mobilization in Ceará \(Brazil\)** 

 An exemplar of how Castro’s work has been taken up by trade unions and parliamentarians is in the State of Ceará, north\-eastern Brazil, where his research underpinned successful campaigns to stop new legislation to privatize the region’s public WSS utility, Companhia de Água e Esgoto do Ceará \(CAGECE\). Castro had involved CAGECE as a research partner in the Project DESAFIO \(GRANT2\). When the threat of CAGECE’s privatization emerged in 2017, the Union of Workers in Water, Sewage, and Environment of the State of Ceará \(SINDIAGUA\-CE\) jointly with provincial legislators and politicians invited him to participate in a Public Hearing to help stop the government’s privatization initiative. The President of the Labour, Administration, and Public Service Commission of Ceará’s Legislative Assembly sent Castro a formal invitation to speak at the Public Hearing, which took place on 15 September 2017 \( **IMP3a**\). SINDIAGUAS’ President confirmed the “significant contribution of Prof. Castro’s research on the negative impacts of the privatization of WSS”. He stated that the research is “elucidative and fundamental for defending WSS public companies and public policies and in the struggle for the democratization of the management and access of essential WSS, and defending the understanding of water as a right of all citizens”. He continued, “the Public Hearing, which had a large attendance \[…\], was broadcasted by the Legislative Assembly’s TV channel and diverse local media \(radio, TV, websites, blogs, and journals\), giving Castro’s message a significant reach in the State of Ceará” \( **IMP3b\-c**\). The Public Hearing was successful in persuading the governor to stop the privatization initiative. However, since 2018 the national government of President Bolsonaro started pressuring local and provincial governments to privatize public utilities, including CAGECE. SINDIAGUA continues to benefit from Castro’s research in their resistance to these policies to keep Ceará’s WSS in public hands, as stated by the union’s President in June 2020: “SINDIAGUA uses frequently Prof. Esteban’s data and observations in events, publications, and public reports during our activities to stop the persistent initiatives to privatize WSS” \( **IMP3b**\). 

 **Enabling Mobilization of Civil Society in El Salvador for a General Water Law** 

 Castro’s work \(PUB1\-5\) has been used by civil society organizations and political parties in their activities to promote the democratization of water policy and management in El Salvador, which lacks a national water law, including the development of “a citizens’ proposal for a General Water Law”. In a letter signed by several leaders of these organizations, including former Economy Minister \(2012\-2014\), and former Presidential Commissioner for Human Rights \(2018\-2019\), they state that “we have taken Castro’s work on the democratization of water politics and management as reference in our activities as civil society organizations and social movements that include the Water Forum, Caritas El Salvador, the Centre for Consumers’ Defence \(CDC\), the Foundation for the Application of Law \(FESPAD\), El Salvador’s section of the VIDA Network, among others” \( **IMP4a**\). 

 To set the context, these organizations formed part of the alliance that won the 2009 national elections, and, as they put it, “our water campaign entered a new stage, as some of our members were elected as legislators and others took government positions in the economy, environment, human rights and consumer protection areas” \( **IMP4a**\). As part of their campaign to get the citizens’ project for a national water law passed in the Legislative Assembly, they organized an international event titled “The Role of Parliament and the challenges of inclusive water governance”, that took place on 12 November 2013. They invited Castro to deliver a keynote speech at the event “to support us in the process, strengthening our arguments, raising the level of debate in the Legislative Assembly and, especially, persuading the opposition legislators of the need to pass a General Water Law for the country” \( **IMP4a**\). Castro’s contribution was thoroughly cited in the national media \( **IMP4b**\). The contribution of the research to the long\-term campaign, including this event, is recognized as having “contributed to strengthen the arguments and capacity for incidence of important social sectors in El Salvador, whose efforts, despite strong opposition, achieved that the Assembly’s Legislative Commission of Environment and Climate Change obtained consensual approval of 92 articles of the Water Law project by June 2014” \( **IMP4a**\). Regrettably, despite this success, the opposition in the National Assembly, representing the interests of large\-scale water users \(particularly landowners and businesses\), has so far managed to block the passing of the water law. The Campaign continues and has included the submission in 2018 of a proposal for constitutional reform to include the human right to water and sanitation and an updated project of the General Water Law in 2020. Castro continues to be closely involved with the actors \( **IMP4a**\). 

 **Summary** 

 Examples of the take\-up of Castro’s research by civil society organizations, government officials, labour unions, and other actors in Latin America, are too numerous to be included in full here. Overall, Castro’s research is used by a range of social actors, including local, regional, national, and global civil society organizations, social movements, labour unions, legislators, and politicians from across Central and South America, in several languages. The work has contributed to the training of senior labour union members, strengthening capacities, providing scientific evidence\-grounded arguments for successful campaigns for the human right to water and the democratization of water policy and management. This impact of the research is plainly recognized by the beneficiaries, who remain in close interaction with Castro’s work to date.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Strathclyde’s research on job quality, skills utilisation and workplace partnership has shaped Scotland’s approach to fair work and driven its implementation and ongoing development. By informing the Working Together Review, the research approach and findings drove the establishment of an independent Fair Work Convention, and underpinned the development of the FWC Fair Work Framework. Since 2016, this Framework has influenced Scottish Government policy \(the most notable outcome being the publication and pursuit of a Fair Work Action Plan\), shaped the priorities and practices of public agencies delivering business support, and changed the practices of employers and unions. This has contributed to improvements in job quality, particularly in relation to job security and effective voice, and ensured targeted responses to particular challenges, including sector\-specific issues and the ramifications of the Covid\-19 pandemic. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Under the Directorship of Professor Patricia Findlay, since 2010 the Scottish Centre for Employment Research \(SCER\) at the University of Strathclyde has undertaken conceptual and empirical research on job quality, skills, skills under\-utilisation, and workplace partnership and governance including the role of worker voice \(directly and through unions\) in simultaneously improving workplace practice and worker outcomes. This research has advanced academic understanding and established an evidence base to guide policy and practice by providing an expansive definition of job quality and demonstrating the benefits of a holistic approach that links fair work to individual, business/organisational and societal priorities and outcomes. By adopting a holistic approach that goes beyond an individual’s job quality \(and interest in improving job quality\) to link fair work to individual, business/organisational and societal priorities and outcomes, SCER’s research has identified and highlighted the role and interests of multiple key stakeholders in relation to fair work. This research prioritises collaborative mutual gains approaches to addressing a series of linked individual, workplace, economic and societal agendas around fair work, and emphasises the primary role of employers and their strategic choice in the delivery of fair work, the role unions can play, and the potential for public policy to shape it. Three examples of some of the research undertaken follow. 

 **Skills\-underutilisation \(2010\)**: Working with case study employers, trades unions and the Scottish Trades Union Congress, SCER undertook research into three company\-specific initiatives to address skills\-underutilisation, interviewing managers, workers and trade unions connected to the initiatives. The research identified the need to consider explicitly skills use in the context of business/organisational objectives, HR practices and priorities and the design of work and employment, and the need to build in the delivery of gains to all relevant parties in skills utilisation interventions for these to be implemented successfully \[ **R1**\]. 

 **Fair, Innovative and Transformative Work in Social Care** \(2018\): Conducted for the Fair Work Convention, this project identified barriers to and facilitators of fair work in social care. It did this through an investigation of experiences in 5 third sector care providers, a group discussion session held as part of Scottish Care’s annual Workforce Event, and small\-scale qualitative research with employees and managers at 3 independent sector organisations \[ **R4**\]. 

 **Job quality interventions \(2016\)**: Commissioned by NHS Scotland, SCER examined the role and potential of job quality interventions and specifically of upskilling in facilitating high\-level robotics implementation, with research findings identifying how and where upskilling aligned to automation can deliver better individual and organisational performance, while also identifying real challenges in enhancing the skills and job quality of employees more proximate to technology operations \[ **R6**\]. 

 Key findings from SCER’s overall body of research include: 

-  Workplace interventions are crucial loci in which to address job quality issues. Analysis showed that employers configure job quality in terms of pay, contractual stability, training and skills formation, job design and career development opportunities to produce better \(or worse\) jobs. Consequently, employers’ interests in relation to the availability or otherwise of fair work predominate. The research showed that employer strategies around product/service quality can drive job quality improvements \[ **R3**, **R4**, **R6**\]. 

-  Other workplace stakeholders have an important role to play in shaping how employers respond. SCER’s case studies of union engagement in skills utilisation and collaborative work with employers on skills and learning showed how unions can both improve members’ learning and skills \(with benefits for pay and career prospects\) and ensure that these are deployed effectively in the workplace \[ **R2**\]. 

-  There is scope for intervention and evidence that such interventions can measurably improve job quality \[ **R3**, **R4**, **R6**\]. The research enhanced and deepened knowledge of job quality interventions through empirical work that explains and demonstrates the effectiveness, impact and sustainability of interventions at national, sectoral and workplace level. 

-  Interventions parallel to the workplace by government and other stakeholders can play a reinforcing role. Governments can create policy to encourage employers to deliver job quality; can offer conditional support to businesses; can insert job quality clauses into public procurement contracts; can align economic development and business support to deliver better job quality, and can use education system levers to drive not just skills and qualifications but expectations of high\-quality work \[ **R3**, **R4**\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 By providing a robust and respected evidence base, Strathclyde’s Scottish Centre for Employment Research \(SCER\) has shaped Scotland’s approach to fair work and driven its implementation and ongoing development. This has been achieved through sustained stakeholder collaboration and membership of key groups by Professors Findlay and Lindsay since 2014. As a result, Scotland has established a clear policy, implementation and monitoring framework which has enabled improvements across the various dimensions of fair work, most notably security of employment and income, and highlighted priority areas for action. Sectoral analysis has been at the heart of this, ensuring targeted responses to challenges including the ramifications of the Covid\-19 pandemic. 

###  Shaping Scotland’s approach to fair work 

 Described as ‘a source of inspiration, challenge and support’ by the former Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government \(2010\-2015\), Professor Findlay made a substantial contribution to the Working Together Review of Progressive Workplace Policies in Scotland conducted in 2014 \[ **S1a**\]. Commissioned by the Government, the Review Group \(comprising 8 members, with Findlay as the only academic representative\) drew heavily on SCER research to identify good practice and opportunities for improvement. According to the Review Chair, Findlay ‘played an absolutely vital role in…ensuring that we all saw the big picture, our discussions were evidence\-based, and shaping our conclusions and recommendations’ \[ **S2a**\]. More specifically, SCER ‘research on the potential of employer\-union partnership both at workplace level and in the development of policy at a strategic level, and…on the future challenges facing Scotland’s workplaces, were both crucial to our recommendations that progressive workplace practice could be better supported at a national level by the creation of a stakeholder body to provide leadership on Fair Work’ \[ **S2a**\]. This is evident in the Review report itself which cites **R1** as evidence of the benefits of union engagement in skills utilisation and ‘calls for a more complete approach to optimising our workplaces…recognising the relevance and value that can be delivered by all parties and the gains that can accrue from focussing on common interest’  \[ **S2b** pp.3,18\]. 

 Responding to the Working Together Review recommendations with parliamentary approval, the Scottish Government ‘implemented a number of changes’ in 2014/2015 including: the establishment of a Cabinet Secretary post for Fair Work, Skills and Training \(believed to be the first of its kind in Europe\); creation of the proposed stakeholder body \(known as the Fair Work Convention\); continued support for Scottish Union Learning and a refreshed Memorandum of Understanding with the Scottish Trade Union Congress \(STUC\); establishment and continuation of a staff governance model in the NHS; and support for the Living Wage through funding of the Poverty Alliance and Living Wage Foundation, promotion of Living Wage accreditation and setting an example with the Public Sector Pay Policy \[ **S2c**\]. Established in April 2015 to provide a ‘focal point to develop, promote and sustain a fair work framework in Scotland’, the Fair Work Convention \(comprising 9 members, including Findlay as independent academic advisor\) spent its first year developing an evidence\-based Fair Work Framework. Published in 2016, this drew heavily on SCER’s existing body of research \(mapping entirely to the broad and holistic approach outlined\) as well as new studies commissioned for the purpose including a mapping of stakeholder views and briefings on the key dimensions of fair work \(effective voice, opportunity, security, fulfilments and respect\) \[ **S3a**\]. The Framework also incorporated SCER’s analytical model from the FITwork project which ‘captures how fair work is a crucial component in delivering high performing and innovative workplaces’ \[ **S3a** p.8\]. Attesting to this influence, the Convention Co\-Chair commented, ‘one only has to look at the Endnotes to the Fair Work Framework…to see the impact which the research carried out by the Scottish Centre for Employment Research had on the work of the Convention’ \[ **S3b**\]. 

 In parallel to this, SCER informed the development of the Scottish Government’s National Performance Framework \(NPF\) launched in June 2018. As noted by the Deputy Director of the Government’s Fair Work and Skills Division, ‘Professor Findlay engaged closely with the Scottish Government’s Chief Statistician to make successfully an evidence\-based case for the inclusion of skills utilisation as an indicator in our National Performance Framework, drawing on SCER research to do so. Having this indicator means that the Scottish Government not only measures skills utilisation, but sees its improvement as a policy focus’ \[ **S1b**\]. Endorsement of the ‘Fair Work Framework emphasis on effective voice’ and commitment ‘to supporting the expansion of collective bargaining’ is also stressed \[ **S1b**\], with the STUC welcoming its inclusion in the NPF \[ **S4**\]. Insights from SCER’s research were also incorporated into the report of the Scottish Parliament Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee 2015 inquiry into the quality of employment in Scotland. Quoting Findlay’s written submission and oral evidence \(given June 2015\) numerous times, the report pushed for a ‘firm commitment towards employee engagement and encouraging the strong management and leadership skills needed to improve the workforce in improving its own wellbeing’ and recommended that the Government ‘embed these aims in all the employment business support programmes it funds’ \[ **S5**\]. This led the Government to integrate fair work in its 2015 statutory guidance on the selection of tenderers and award of contracts, which was supplemented with procurement best practice guidance and a toolkit for public bodies and suppliers in 2018 \[ **S6**\]. 

###  Driving the implementation and monitoring of fair work 

 Since establishing the Fair Work Framework in 2016, the Fair Work Convention \(co\-chaired by Findlay from 2017\) has played a key role in advancing Scotland’s fair work agenda. By providing advice and guidance, developing networks and alliances, undertaking research and monitoring, the group has enabled sustained progress to be made. While much is still to be done to make fair work a reality for all workers and employers across Scotland, with the Convention itself noting that faster action is required if Scotland is to become a world\-leading ‘Fair Work Nation’ by 2025, advances in a number of areas have been made. These are outlined in the Fair Work in Scotland report, published in December 2020, which introduces the Fair Work Convention’s Measurement Framework consisting of 39 indicators to reflect the multidimensional nature of fair work and facilitate detailed monitoring \[ **S7a**\]. Drawing on the latest Official Statistics \(including the Labour Force Survey and Annual Population Survey, and the Scottish Employers Skills Survey\) and ensuring statistical significance to provide robust and reliable information, the report evidences improvements across 14 of the indicators between 2015/16 and 2019/20. Though potentially attributable to multiple influences, these improvements are specifically in areas prioritised by the Convention in seeking to drive change, such as in relation to security of employment and income, and effective voice. With the Scottish Government actively pursuing this, the overall measure of employment security in Scotland \(comprising security of contract, pay and hours\) has improved from 54.5% of workers in 2015 to 63.9% of workers in 2019. Similarly, the commitment to effective voice as a key element of workplace quality has seen a rise in the proportion of workers whose terms and conditions are covered by collective bargaining in Scotland from 34.9% in 2015 to 38% in 2019, as well as a pledge by the Scottish Government to establish national collective bargaining in social care \[ **S7a**\]. 

 Various initiatives involving SCER have contributed to these improvements, namely sectoral research highlighting particular challenges and priority areas for action, and the development of an employee self\-assessment tool and a benchmarking tool to support employers’ in delivering fair work. Seeking to ensure that fair work is embedded in the delivery of social care services \(a sector which employs 7.7% of the Scottish labour force\), the Convention established a Social Care Inquiry in January 2017. Overseen by a Social Care Working Group \(comprising 10 members, including Professor Lindsay\) and encompassing SCER research on how frontline workers and their managers feel about their day to day work \[ **R4**\], the inquiry made recommendations to improve employee voice, representation and terms and conditions which are being implemented by the Scottish Government \[ **S7b**\]. Reflecting on the progress made to date, UNISON Scotland’s Regional Manager notes that this ‘is founded upon a recent consensus that enhanced job quality is key to the type of stable workforce required to obtain returns on skills investment, to elevate the status of care work, thereby increasing the quality and capacity of care in Scotland. All that traces back to specific findings and recommendations from Findlay/SCER research’ \[ **S8**\]. Similar work to develop a Fair Work Charter for the construction industry to improve the practices of contractors and sub\-contractors is also underway, involving the Scottish Government, Scottish Futures Trust and industry partners \[ **S4a,b**\]. In addition, at the request of the Scottish Partnership Forum \(SPF\) in 2018, SCER undertook a review of partnership working in NHS Scotland which informed efforts to progress the ‘partnership at all levels to support a more holistic approach to the delivery of health and social care services’ \[ **S9**\]. 

 To support employers to embed fairer working practices, the Government published a Fair Work Action Plan in February 2019 which sets out a range of measures including a benchmarking tool to assess current practice \(developed with input from Findlay\), a refreshed Scottish Business Pledge aligned more closely to Fair Work principles, a new learning network, and an international Fair Work Summit. It also contains a commitment to ‘extend Fair Work criteria to every type of grant, funding stream and business support budget’ \[ **S10a**\]. As reported by the Advisory Group on Economic Recovery in 2020, this Fair Work First approach ‘to the award of business support grants has been phased in by the enterprise bodies and the Scottish Government’ \[ **S10b**\]. Highlighting the benefits of this, the Director of Human Resources at Skills Development Scotland points ‘to numerous examples…where Fair Work ideals have been embedded into the skills action plans developed with businesses’ which have enabled them ‘to grow through improving their staff and including them in decision making processes’ \[ **S1c**\]. Public agencies have also reaped rewards from embedding fair work into their employment practices. According to the Director of Strategy Services at Scottish Enterprise, which employs approximately 1,200 staff, ‘both internally and in service delivery, we have made significant changes in response to the Fair Work Framework, and these have delivered benefits to the businesses we interact with, and to our staff’ \[ **S1d**\]. 

 The principles of fair work have also underpinned the Scottish Government response to the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Deputy Director of the Fair Work and Skills Division, the ‘commitment to ensuring effective voice, and more broadly to fair work, has been at the heart of our Covid\-19 response. The ethos of the Fair Work Framework – solving collective problems through voice, collaboration and dialogue – is now embedded in various ways and processes through which Scotland deals with lockdown, post\-lockdown restart and future economic recovery. *The Advisory Group on Economic Recovery has also stressed the importance of embedding fair work in Scotland’s longer\-term economic recovery, and the Scottish Government is actively working to deliver on their recommendations’* \[ **S1b**\]. This is reflected in actions to establish tripartite voice channels for restart and recovery, address variations in experiences during the pandemic for groups with protected characteristics, and attach fair work conditionality to Covid\-19 support \[ **S10b**\]. Furthermore, as noted in a joint statement on ‘Fair work during the transition out of lockdown’ issued in July 2020: ‘Adopting Fair Work practices has helped to guide employers and workers in agreeing fair and flexible practices. We have already seen the value of this approach to decision making in responding to the crisis so far, and the efforts being made across all sectors is hugely appreciated’ \[ **S10c**\]. As part of this, ‘a protocol between the Scottish Government and the civil service unions has been developed on how they will work together during the coronavirus crisis’ which ‘sets the expectations for an approach to be taken across the civil service sector and promoted more widely across the public sector and beyond’ \[ **S10c**\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 The risks from human\-caused climate change are global in scope and may become unrivalled in magnitude. These complex changes in climate are often encapsulated by a single metric: the global\-mean temperature change. Our research has generated one of the official sources quantifying changes in global temperature including a detailed evaluation of the uncertainties. Our global temperature record demonstrates that the current decade is 1.1±0.1 °C warmer than the pre\-industrial baseline. This research has been used in all major international assessments of climate change that underpin the development of national and international climate mitigation policy. The long\-term goals of the primary policy, the Paris Agreement, are defined by global temperature limits and our research has been used to track progress with respect to these goals and thus also informs critical targets for global reductions of carbon emissions. Our impact has, therefore, been on the development of public policy and evaluating the progress towards the policy goals.

 2. Underpinning research 

 UEA’s research into changes in Earth’s global surface temperature began in the 1980s at the Climatic Research Unit \(CRU, part of the School of Environmental Sciences\) led by Professor **Phil Jones**, and more recently by Professor **Tim Osborn**. This research produces the *land* air temperature dataset \(CRUTEM **\[R1, R2\]**\) that, through close collaboration, is combined with *sea* surface temperature data from the Met Office. The resultant global temperature dataset \(HadCRUT **\[R3, R4\]**\) is one of three main products commonly used to monitor global warming by international organisations such as the World Meteorological Organisation \(WMO\) and the United Nations \(UN\). HadCRUT is part of the WMO’s Catalogue for Climate Data, as “ *a trustworthy source for climate data… assessed through an internationally agreed maturity evaluation process*” \( [climatedata\-catalogue.wmo.int](https://climatedata-catalogue.wmo.int/)\). 

 Estimating global temperature from raw data that were not explicitly designed for climate monitoring purposes, and that therefore suffer from time\-varying biases in the measurements and from incomplete geographical coverage, is a significant research challenge that we have addressed over several decades. Having multiple independent datasets, including HadCRUT **\[R3, R4\]**, is essential to demonstrate that the temperature record is robust to different methodological choices. Aspects of our approach that make HadCRUT distinct from other datasets \(and therefore a critical part of this multi\-dataset ensemble\) are: \(i\) it is the longest established land and sea dataset \(first combined in 1986\); \(ii\) it spans the longest time period \(1850 to present\) getting closer to the pre\-industrial baseline chosen by policymakers **\[R5\]**; \(iii\) we utilise homogenization efforts undertaken by national or regional initiatives, which benefits from knowledge of local circumstances and additional observing stations, rather than applying statistical algorithms to identify and correct for inhomogeneities **\[R2\]**; and \(iv\) we have developed a comprehensive error model to deal with the multiple and interacting sources of potential error **\[R3, R4\]**. Our research demonstrates that warming far exceeds any uncertainty in the record. 

 Ongoing UEA research has allowed us to: \(I\) incorporate newly digitized or compiled measurements \(a recent expansion from 4842 to 7983 weather stations, led by **David Lister**\) **\[R4\]**; \(II\) create an ensemble of 200 alternative realisations to represent the uncertainties **\[R4\]**; \(III\) address biases arising from limited sampling of the fast\-warming Arctic region by first acquiring more high\-latitude data **\[R2\]** and then interpolating to obtain a spatially complete dataset \(the HadCRUT5 Analysis **\[R4\]**\). 

 The Paris Agreement expressed global temperature changes relative to a *“pre\-industrial baseline”* but did not define this baseline. Therefore, in collaboration with the University of Reading and others, we made a more thorough assessment of the warming since the pre\-industrial baseline to provide a better estimate of our remaining headroom to the Paris Agreement goals **\[R5\]**. Our ongoing research has continually improved and refined our estimates of global warming. It shows that the 2011\-20 decade was 1.1±0.1 °C warmer than pre\-industrial. 

 Alongside Earth’s surface temperature, changes and variability in other fundamental meteorological variables \(precipitation, vapour pressure, cloud cover\) have also been determined by research at UEA’s CRU. This has enabled the creation of a complementary and higher spatial resolution dataset \(CRU TS **\[R6\]**, led by **Ian Harris**\) to better reveal regional climate changes for multiple climate variables over land, and to derive indices for monitoring drought. CRU TS is one of the most widely used datasets in climate science **\[R6\]**, supporting the monitoring and analysis of variability and trends in hydroclimate, critical for many climate impacts, and relied upon as input to model simulations of terrestrial carbon fluxes for tracking the fate of our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 

 All these datasets are routinely updated and disseminated via open\-access data centres and Google Earth interfaces. Output citations and data download statistics demonstrate their importance and reach \(Scopus citation counts on 29/1/21 were 1058 for **\[R2\]**, 1416 for **\[R3\]**, 4849 for **\[R6\]**\). The importance of these datasets has been recognised as essential work and now receives long\-term funding from the UK’s National Centre for Atmospheric Science \(NCAS\) to sustain it.

 4. Details of the impact 

 Our research has had impact on public policy, because it is a significant part of the science underpinning the development of national and international climate mitigation policy. Our impact is also on the engagement that is necessary for the global public to support such ambitious and far\-reaching policies. The ultimate benefit of these climate mitigation policies will be reducing the adverse impacts of climate change on society and the environment. 

 **Impact on public policy: international climate mitigation policy** 

 The 2015 Paris Agreement is the flagship international climate mitigation policy: all governments agreed to limit global warming to well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. These goals are considered crucial to “ *significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change*” and they are defined in terms of global\-mean temperature changes relative to a pre\-industrial baseline, which our research has now better defined **\[R5\]**. 

 The Paris Agreement was negotiated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\). The UNFCCC is a science\-based convention and uses the “ *information in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) reports as a baseline on the state of knowledge on climate change when making science\-based decisions*” **\[S1, S2\]**. The UNFCCC also commissioned the IPCC to assess the science related to the Paris Agreement. It is through the IPCC reports that our research has influenced the Paris Agreement and policies to implement it **\[S2\]**. 

 Our HadCRUT global temperature record **\[R3\]** has appeared in the Summary for Policy Makers and Synthesis Report of all five IPCC assessments, most recently in the fifth assessment report \(AR5, **\[S3\]**\). HadCRUT4 data features in the overall Synthesis Report **\[S3\]** and the Summary for Policy Makers of the Working Group I \(WGI\) report **\[S4\]**. Our research on global **\[R3\]** and land **\[R2\]** temperature is cited in Chapter 2 of the accompanying WGI report **\[S4\]**. The co\-chair of IPCC WGI \(2008 to 2015\) confirms the importance of our global temperature record to the IPCC: “ *UEA’s research led to important improvements in this record, especially in the better quantification of its uncertainties and biases, which enabled a more robust IPCC assessment of climate system warming*” **\[S2\]**. 

 Our temperature record together with our new quantification of its uncertainty **\[R3\]** were central lines of evidence for two of IPCC’s most important findings **\[S4\]**. IPCC WGI co\-chair confirms the impact of our global temperature research and data thus: “ *Their global temperature record… was a significant line of evidence for key IPCC AR5 statements… «Warming of the climate system is unequivocal» and «Human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming»*” **\[S2\]**. These are both catalysts for urgent climate mitigation policy. 

 Climate mitigation policy is even more urgent because climate change is already being seen at regional scales and in ways that directly affect social and natural systems. Our CRU TS3.10 dataset **\[R6\]** was used as evidence in IPCC AR5 **\[S4\]** that such changes are underway, particularly that the hydrological cycle has already changed. Specifically, it was used in Chapter 2, with headline findings about precipitation change reported in the WGI Technical Summary \(TFE.1 Fig. 2\) and Summary for Policymakers **\[S4\]**. IPCC WGI co\-chair confirms that CRU TS3.10 “ *was a significant line of evidence underpinning the IPCC assessment of changes to the hydrological cycle… for example, that precipitation in the mid\-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere has increased*” **\[S2\]**. 

 The importance of the IPCC scientific assessment, including the contribution from our research, to development of the Paris Agreement is expressed by IPCC WGI co\-chair: “ *The Fifth Assessment Report of IPCC, especially the WGI SPM and the overall Synthesis Report, which both featured the HadCRUT global temperature record, was an important step towards the development of international climate mitigation policy embodied in the UNFCCC Paris Agreement… This importance arises because the UNFCCC is a science\-based convention which uses IPCC reports as a baseline on the state of knowledge on climate change*” **\[S2\]**. 

 While the IPCC assessments synthesize the underpinning science for these policy negotiations, the temperature targets themselves were agreed following a parallel science\-policy process: the “Structured Expert Dialogue” \(SED\) during 2013–2015. The SED led directly to the strengthening of the previous 2°C target **\[S5\]** and its final report **\[S6\]** used our HadCRUT4 record as evidence in its assessment that warming to date had reached 0.85°C \(the source is given as IPCC 2013 **\[S4\]** which cites our underpinning research **\[R2, R3\]**\). IPCC WGI co\-chair confirms the link to policy development: “ *the SED was the main science\-policy process underpinning the development of the Paris Agreement and it relied entirely on the IPCC fifth assessment report for its scientific baseline*” **\[S2\]**. 

 As well as providing a catalyst for the development of stronger climate mitigation policy, our research provides a measure of progress towards meeting the policy goals \(which are framed as global temperature change limits\) and it critically also provides an observational constraint on the future carbon budget required to meet the temperature target. These were important considerations in the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C \(SR1.5 **\[S7a\]**\), which was the first major assessment of the Paris Agreement goals. Our work to better define the pre\-industrial baseline **\[R5\]** was used and cited in this report **\[S7a\]**. Our temperature record **\[R3\]** featured in its Summary for Policymakers to quantify how close historical warming has already come to the 1.5°C goal and to estimate the remaining carbon budget **\[S7a\]**. The UNFCCC welcomed this report and encouraged countries to use it to strengthen their scientific understanding \(decisions 24\-29 of the UNFCCC COP24 **\[S7b\]**\). Thus, our research is now forming part of the science basis for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. 

 The impact is “near\-universal” and truly global as 190 parties have ratified the Paris Climate Agreement, so almost the entire globe. 

 **Impact on public policy: national UK climate mitigation policy** 

 Our evidence of the amount and rate of global and regional European warming **\[R2, R3\]** also underpinned the development of UK climate policy **\[S8\]**. UK government policy on international action for climate change from 2010 to 2015 stated that *“The Earth’s surface has consequently warmed by about 0.8°C since around 1900, with much of this warming occurring in the past 50 years”* **\[S8a\]**. The scientific evidence for this statement comes from our HadCRUT temperature record **\[R3\] \[S8\]**. 

 In 2019, the UK’s 2008 Climate Change Act was strengthened to mandate net\-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Committee on Climate Change’s “Net Zero” report \(May 2019, **\[S9a\]**\) was used as the basis for the 2019 amendment. It begins its presentation of the climate science with the warming already seen as evidenced by our global temperature record **\[R3\]**. The “Net Zero” report **\[S9a\]**, formally requested by the UK Government in 2018 to provide guidance on the timing of UK’s reduction to net\-zero carbon emissions, states as a “key conclusion” that “ *Human activity has already led to 1°C of global warming from pre\-industrial levels which has resulted in damaging impacts on lives, infrastructure and ecosystems that are apparent today*” based on our contribution to the IPCC SR1.5 report **\[S7a\]**. The 2019 amendment to the Climate Change Act “broadly puts into effect” the “Net Zero” recommendation from the Climate Change Committee \(House of Commons Briefing Paper, Dec 2019; **\[S9b\]**\). This chain of evidence corroborates the UK policy impact of our research. 

 **Impact on public understanding and engagement: societal awareness of climate change and the need for mitigation policy** 

 Our global temperature record **\[R3\]** was centre stage in what has been described as “probably the most watched broadcast about the climate ever” **\[S10a\]** – a segment on climate change in the opening ceremony of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics. This featured an animated spiral using UEA’s HadCRUT4 dataset showing the rise in temperatures from 1850 to the present, originally created and popularised by Ed Hawkins \(University of Reading\). The International Olympic Committee estimated that 342 million people watched this opening ceremony \(Reuters, **\[S10b\]**\). 

 The climate mitigation policy needed to achieve the aims of the Paris Climate Agreement is so\-wide reaching that it requires the engagement and support of all communities worldwide. Reaching an audience of over a third of a billion people is a significant milestone in raising public understanding of ongoing climate change.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers at the University of Oxford demonstrated the utility of mobile phone contact tracing apps to control the COVID\-19 pandemic and provided the epidemiological evidence base used by the UK government, governments worldwide, and Google and Apple, to take the decision to develop and deploy these tools. Their research produced fundamental principles, benchmarks, parameters and design that were taken up by governments and developers and have significantly contributed to the uptake and impact of the apps worldwide. In the UK, the NHS COVID\-19 Contact Tracing App sent 1,700,000 exposure notifications to break chains of transmission and prevented an estimated 600,000 cases of COVID\-19 in the UK between September and December 2020. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research of Professor Christophe Fraser’s group focuses on population dynamics and epidemiology of pathogens, developing mathematical models and tools for public health. Between 2016 and 2020, the Fraser group in Oxford completed the development of a computationally efficient agent\-based mathematical model \(PopART\-IBM\) to simulate sexual networks to understand the HIV epidemic in Zambia as part of the Population Effects of Antiretroviral Therapy to Reduce HIV Transmission \(PopART\) HPTN 071 Trial. They showed how the model calibrates within a Bayesian inference framework to detailed age\- and sex\-stratified data from multiple sources on HIV prevalence, awareness of HIV status, ART status, and viral suppression and presented future projections of HIV prevalence and incidence for this community in the absence of trial intervention \[1\]. 

 In January 2020, the Oxford group begun work on the COVID\-19 epidemiological data coming out of China. Their paper in Science \[2\] represents the unique conception of a mobile phone contact tracing app for controlling the epidemic spread of COVID\-19. It recommended that a mobile app that identifies infected people and their recent person\-to\-person contacts using digital technology should form part of an integrated COVID\-19 control strategy. They demonstrated the epidemic potential of COVID\-19 and, critically, showed the importance of understanding routes of transmission. In \[2\], they compared protecting the population using isolation coupled with manual human contact tracing versus algorithmic instantaneous contact tracing assisted by a mobile phone app and concluded that a phone app is an effective strategy for control. Aware of the short incubation time for COVID\-19, they highlighted importance of quick contact tracing. In the paper, they also were among the first research teams globally to identify substantial transmission of COVID\-19 before symptoms, and to quantify the importance of this for contact tracing. 

 The Oxford group adapted the HIV sexual network simulation developed in \[1\] for the case of COVID\-19 for social networks \[3\], which drive COVID\-19 infection. The Oxford group also showed that a mobile contact tracing app is still effective at low rates of app uptake, reducing deaths and infections. This work was done in collaboration with Google \[4\]. 

 In May 2020 the UK introduced a Test, Trace, Isolate programme in response to the COVID\-19 pandemic, with the Isle of Wight piloting the NHS COVID\-19 contact tracing app. The Oxford group observed significant decreases in incidence and R on the Isle of Wight immediately after the launch, showing that the sub\-epidemic on the Isle of Wight was controlled significantly more effectively than the sub\-epidemics of most other regions. This work was the first evaluation of an intervention containing a contact tracing app demonstrating a reduction in transmission \[5\]. 

 With collaborators, the Oxford researchers investigated the timing of the infectious period in relation to time of infection and time of symptom onset \[6\]. Knowledge about the timing of the infectious period is critical for both manual and app\-based contact tracing as it determines which contacts need to go into quarantine and for how long.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Contact tracing is a key tool for enabling locally specific and relevant control measures, identification of emergence of dangerous clusters, enabling an informed public health response and promoting socially responsible behaviours for individuals. The Oxford research informed decisions by governments and development companies to pursue digital contact tracing for COVID\-19 and detailed parameters for deployment to maximise the impact of this public health intervention to prevent infections, break chains of transmission, save lives and reduce the burden on health systems. 

####  Providing an evidence base for governments 

#####  UK 

 Within a week of sharing the preprint of \[2\] with the UK Government, Oxford researchers embarked on developing a digital contract tracing programme with NHS\-X from 7 March 2020. NHS\-X CEO confirms that \[2\] “ *provided compelling evidence that digital contact tracing could play an important role in controlling the pandemic*”, that it *“played a pivotal role in ministers’ decision to pursue digital contact tracing”,* and it *“contributed significantly to the government’s response to Covid\-19”.* \[A\]. Fraser was called as a witness to the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology on 28 April 2020 alongside the NHS\-X CEO who confirmed the Oxford research provided the scientific justification for the NHS app stating “W *e very quickly moved when Professor Fraser gave us the epidemiological basis for why it would be a powerful intervention”.* \[B\]. 

 This role of the Oxford research in the decision to pursue digital contact tracing is described by the Government Office for Science, who stated 

 *“Prof Christophe Fraser was present from the outset and played the central role in providing evidence that mobile contact tracing – using an app – could play a powerful role in controlling the pandemic. His work, subsequently published in Science \[2\], played a decisive role in both convincing us that this was an important direction to pursue and also illuminating the directions that might be taken to implement the approach. Prof Fraser was scrupulous in helping us to understand strengths and limitations.”* \[C\] 

 The Oxford team produced two reports for the UK Government \[D, E\] assessing options in detail, which led to the UK pilot of the mobile contact tracing app on the Isle of Wight in May 2020 as part of a pilot of the Test and Trace system, which was successful in reducing transmission and controlling the epidemic \[5\]. Based on their research including \[2\], the Oxford researchers laid out in May 2020 five epidemiological and public health requirements that any COVID\-19 tracing app should satisfy \[F\]. These are 

1.  Sensitively and specifically quarantine infectious individuals 

1.  Higher user uptake and adherence 

1.  Rapid notification 

1.  Integration with local health policy 

1.  Ability to evaluate effectiveness transparently 

 The NHX\-C CEO described that these requirements *“summarised succinctly the guiding principles of the app’s development*” \[A\], citing \[2\] and \[D,E,F\]. 

 The Government Office for Science letter confirms *“Prof Fraser and his team \[…\], actively contributed to all aspects of the app development”* and in describing \[D, E\] notes the “ *major contributions to the setting of the parameters of the app and modelling of design alternatives. They also participated in extensive work on validation including preparation for multiple searching independent checks of their work.”* \[C\] 

 The NHS Test and Trace Product Director gave the following example of how the research has impacted the app design: 

 *“Their initial modelling work, in particular the assessment of the distribution over index case infectiousness, is used within the NHS COVID\-19 app, and also referenced in recommendations around the world. Inclusion of this distribution within the app’s risk scoring helped to reduce the number of false notifications by over 30%.”* \[G\] 

 Following the Isle of Wight pilot, the UK app moved to the Google/Apple platform. The Oxford group established a partnership with Google to develop the platform. Oxford’s five principles were used by the Google/Apple Exposure Notification API developers as requirements for their app to meet before launch. 

#####  Globally 

 The Google/Apple API drives the UK NHS COVID\-19 contact tracing app and many other apps worldwide. In Europe in particular, countries have embraced the decentralised model provided by Google/Apple including UK, Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and Ireland. The API is integrated into the operating system of Apple and Android phones and a risk scoring algorithm is used to decide how to sum up exposure times to arrive at an overall risk score which will lead to an exposure notification to the user if one or more of the contacts later test positive for COVID\-19. The UK NHS app uses its own risk scoring algorithm which is based on research by the Fraser group and the Alan Turing Institute. 

 In a letter, the Vice President of Engineering at Google commented on impact on the press: 

 *“The initial absence of evidence made health authorities reluctant to invest in the technology and users hesitant to adopt it. When the press misinterpreted findings to question the feasibility of digital contact tracing, Professor Fraser’s team proactively clarified the misunderstanding; changing the narrative in the mainstream press.”* \[H\] 

 Describing the impact of \[4\] on approaches by governments and health authorities, Google wrote: 

 *“It’s difficult to overstate how impactful this evidence base has been in enabling governments make informed decisions around adopting Exposure Notifications technology. The joint publication’s focus on low levels of app adoption and the added impact to traditional contact tracing was also instrumental in convincing uptake of the technology by many public health authorities, as part of collaboration with different third party entities, and even with uptake by the public.”* \[H\] 

 On the topic of global impact, the Government Office for Science said: 

 *“the app as it currently exists would not exist without the scientific work of Prof Fraser. Furthermore, the work of Prof Fraser informed the efforts of numerous other countries \(including France, Norway, Ireland, Israel\) each of which took different directions but nevertheless relied upon scientific and modelling direction established by Prof Fraser. I will be unequivocal: this is the finest example of true scientific impact that I have encountered in my career. It combines excellent scientific work, advocacy, engagement, ethics and selfless work in extremely difficult conditions and under great pressure. It has undoubtedly saved lives and had substantial economic impact.”* \[C\] 

####  Impact on Google and Apple 

 Google describe the impact of the Oxford research on their decision to pursue digital contact tracing: 

 *“Prior to this pandemic, there was little known about effectiveness of digital contact tracing technologies and factors key to their success. The Fraser group’s initial publication in Science \[2\] and report to the NHS provided scientifically credible and immensely valuable information in this area.”* \[H\] 

 Google also describe specific examples of how the underpinning research influenced the app design, including the requirement set out in \[F\] for rapid notification: 

 *“At Google and Apple, these results directly influenced API design decisions; they demonstrated user\-reported symptoms were an important facilitator of timely notifications, leading us to support self\-reported symptoms in the API. Findings also informed quantifiable benchmarks for system efficacy \(e.g., the number of days by which contacts must be notified\), which enabled strategic investment of time and resources \(e.g., effort to help health authorities automate distribution of codes verifying a positive test\).”* \[H\] 

####  Health impact of NHS COVID\-19 Contact Tracing App 

 Between launch on 24 September 2020 and 31 December 2020, NHS COVID\-19 app was downloaded to over 21,000,000 phones, and used regularly by approximately 16,500,000 users in England and Wales, which is 49% of the eligible population with compatible phones, and 28% of the total population. During these three months, the app sent 1,700,000 exposure notifications to break chains of transmission and in an analysis by the Fraser group with collaborators \[I\], they estimated **600,000 cases had been prevented**. The success of the app during 2020 was made public by the Government in February 2021 \[J\]. 

 The NHS Test and Trace Product Director explains that 

 *“The app has an estimated \(lower bound\) secondary attack rate of approximately 6%, which compares favourably to traditional contact tracing, yet has the advantage of being privacy preserving and extremely fast. The app has therefore been crucial in breaking chains of transmission and protecting users and their communities.”* and goes on to confirm that the University of Oxford’s *“contributions to its development have helped prevent many cases of COVID\-19, and ultimately deaths.”* \[G\] 

####  Predicting infection rates for healthcare planning and provision 

 The COVID\-19 social network open source simulation OpenABM\-Covid\-19 \[3\] was the main tool used by NHS England and NHS Wales to predict COVID\-19 infection rates and therefore plan key resources e.g. staffing, hospital beds, equipment, medications. The AI technology specialist company Faculty use Oxford’sOpenABM\-Covid\-19 as the underpinning simulation for their contact with NHS\-England to provide data visualisations dashboard information for key central government decision\-makers with a deeper level of information about the current and future coronavirus situation to help inform the response \[K\]. Similarly, the company Armakuni provide data visualisations for NHS\-Wales. OpenABM\-Covid\-19 \[3\] has also been used by Singapore and France to predict infection rates and therefore plan key resources e.g. staffing, hospital beds, equipment, medications.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Quality of life for patients on long\-term oral anticoagulation therapy is negatively affected by the travel associated with up to 20 regular checks per year at their GP or hospital. Research, led by the University of Aberdeen Health Technology Assessment Group, was responsible for NICE guidance recommendations approving a Roche\-manufactured device for self\-testing by patients in both England and Scotland. The recommendations underpinned NHS Trust guidelines for patients and carers, saved time in NHS primary care settings, improved the quality of life for patients and generated commercial benefits. 17,000 patients in the UK use the device and in one NHS Trust with 500 patients, the number of out\-patients attendees has halved, avoiding over 55,000 in\-patient appointments in a seven\-year period. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Patients with atrial fibrillation, heart valve disease, or other cardiac conditions are at increased risk of the formation of blood clots in the chambers of their heart. These clots can break away and block vessels in the brain \(thromboembolism\) causing a stroke. Patients with these conditions often require long\-term oral anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of clots forming. Of these, 47% take Warfarin \(a vitamin K antagonist\) with the goal of establishing a balance between the bleeding and clotting risks. Treatment with Warfarin requires frequent monitoring to ensure the patient’s international normalised ratio \(INR\) – a standardised unit for measuring the time it takes for blood to clot – is in the appropriate therapeutic range. 

 Standard practice is for INR to be monitored by healthcare professionals in anticoagulant clinics. An alternative is the use of a personal coagulometer at home, which allows people to perform self\-testing \(where they carry out the test themselves and the results are managed by healthcare professionals\) or self\-management \(where they carry out the test and alter their dose of anticoagulation therapy using a personalised protocol\). Self\-testing and self\-management are collectively referred to as self\-monitoring. Approximately 450,000 of the 1,500,000 patients in England who take Warfarin are clinically suited to adopting a self\-monitoring regime \[S3\]. It has been estimated that if 25% of these patients took up self\-monitoring, it would save the NHS approximately GBP62,000,000 per year \[S4\]. However, the adoption of new technology and practice in the NHS is very slow \[S9\]. The work presented in this case study provided the evidence needed for official approval of the approach, which has accelerated growth in the use of INR self\-monitoring. 

 The research presented in this case study \[1,2; P1\] was undertaken by the Health Services Research Unit \(HSRU\), Health Economics Research Unit \(HERU\) and Population Health Medical Statistics group at University of Aberdeen combine expertise as an independent academic centre to undertake technology assessment reviews for the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) in England. 

 In 2013, the National Institute for Health Care Excellence \(NICE\), through the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) Health Technology Assessment \(HTA\) programme, commissioned the University of Aberdeen Group to conduct a technology assessment review of self\-monitoring of the coagulation status of people who were receiving long\-term vitamin K antagonist therapy, compared with the standard UK practice, where the patient visits their GP or a hospital \[P1\]. Up to 20 visits per year may be needed \[S1\]. 

 The study \(2015\) involved a meta\-analysis of randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\) and assessed the clinical effectiveness of self\-monitoring compared to primary or secondary care\-based INR monitoring, and created an economic model to assess cost\-effectiveness \[1,2\]. Several personal coagulometers were assessed including the CoaguChek® XS and S models \(Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland\). The economic model \[2\] captured the incidence of stroke and bleeding events in individuals on long\-term Warfarin therapy under standard monitoring. Then the effects of self\-monitoring were derived from the controlled trials data. The impact of these strategies on the 10\-year incidence of stroke and bleeding events was projected. Quality adjusted life years \(QALYs\) were extrapolated over the 10\-year time horizon. 

 Based on the evidence from 26 RCTs \(8,763 participants\), both self\-management and self\-testing were found to be as safe as the standard practice in terms of major bleeding events. Most of the RCTs \(22 of 26\) related to the CoaguChek® system, and the economic analysis focused on comparing that system with standard INR monitoring. Cost\-effectiveness results were also calculated for the other personal coagulometers assuming equivalent efficacy to the CoaguChek® system \[2\]. 

 The economic model \[2; chapter 3\] showed mean health and social care costs \(per individual\) amounted to approx. GBP7,330 for both standard care and with CoaguChek® self\-monitoring. Self\-monitoring was associated with an absolute reduction of 2.5% in the proportion of people suffering a thromboembolic event and generated an average QALY gain of 0.027 compared with standard care \[2\]. Applying a cost\-effectiveness threshold of GBP20,000 per QALY gained, self\-monitoring as whole was found to have 80% probability of being cost\-effective compared with standard care. Self\-management on its own generated cost savings from the health and social care perspective and generated more QALYs compared to standard monitoring.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research findings described in this case study \[1,2\] provided the evidence needed for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\), to justify the clinical and cost effectiveness for international normalised ratio \(INR\) self\-testing for patients on Warfarin. These findings have underpinned healthcare policy and benefited front\-line medical services, patients and commercial companies. 

 The impacts can be summarised under four headings: 

 1.Enabling clinical guidelines 

 2.Reducing the burden on NHS primary care 

 3.Improving the lives of patients 

 4.Delivering commercial benefit 

 **Enabling clinical guidelines** 

 Healthcare providers can only use medical devices that are approved. In order for this approval to be granted, the device has to be independently assessed and reviewed by NICE. In 2014 the NICE appraisal committee in England recommended the use of the CoaguChek® XS system, based on evidence in the report it commissioned from the Aberdeen HTA Group \[2\], \[S1i\]. The resulting NICE guidance DG14 recommended the system “ *for self\-monitoring coagulation status in people on long\-term vitamin K antagonist therapy who have atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease if: a. the patient prefers this form of testing and b. the patient or their carer is both physically and cognitively able to do the self\-monitoring effectively”* \[S1i, ii\]. 

 NICE diagnostic guidance is provided to help the NHS make efficient, cost\-effective and consistent decisions about adopting new diagnostic technology, but NHS clinical commissioning groups \(CCGs\) do not have a legal obligation to make recommended technologies available. To accelerate the uptake of the recommendations in DG14, NICE produced resources, including a costing statement \(updated in 2017\), which confirmed the savings associated with its recommendation, to help ensure health service commissioners, health service managers and the public followed the recommendations and that self\-care monitoring was adopted across the NHS. The guidance stated, *“Where self\-monitoring leads to decreased demand for services such as anti\-coagulation clinics there may be savings for both CCGs and NHS England. The annual cost of anti\-coagulation monitoring within a primary or secondary care setting has been estimated to be approximately GBP250 per person”* \[S3\]. 

 The Aberdeen report \[2\] was also reviewed by the Scottish Health Technologies Group \(which provides similar guidance to NICE for NHS Scotland\) and used to inform updated advice for NHS Scotland \(2015\), which said, “ *\[..\], self monitoring of INR, and particularly self\-management, where patients carry out both testing and dose adjustment, is likely to be a safe, effective and cost\-effective monitoring option for motivated and competent patients receiving long\-term vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulation therapy*” \[S2\]. 

 **Reducing the demand on NHS primary care** 

 The nature of the impact on the health service can best be illustrated by considering the UK self\-testing pilot that took place on the Isle of Wight. In 2015–16 the relevant CCG piloted an automated Warfarin self\-monitoring service developed by Inhealthcare \(a digital health and remote patient monitoring company\) with 100 patients using the Roche INR CoaguChek® self\-testing device \[S5\]. The pilot was successful and relieved pressure on GP surgeries and reduced disruption to patient lives. The CCG Primary Care Commissioning Manager stated, *“We hope that this digital service will allow patients to take a greater interest in their condition, monitoring their INR enabling them to stay within their therapeutic range – reducing their risk of a stroke.  This reflects NICE’s latest guidance on the potential of improving health outcomes with self\-monitoring and self\-testing”* \[S5\]. As of 2017, this self\-testing digital service has been expanded to patients in Wigan, Bracknell and Ascot, Durham and Darlington and Kent \[S5\]. 

 The Clinical Lead for the home pilot testing said: *“All warfarin clinics on the island are experiencing a high volume of patients accessing the service, so enabling patients to self\-test will alleviate pressure on General Practices. The reduction in patients attending the clinics will allow more time to be spent with more complex patients, increasing the level of care for all”* \[S5\]. 

 The CoaguChek® Inhealthcare\-led system has also been used in the anticoagulation pathway managed by Inhealthcare for the County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust \(CDDFT\) since April 2014. It serves 2,500 patients who are taking Warfarin in the region \[S6\]. A case study stated that from March 2013 to August 2020, the service saved the trust over 55,000 appointments. The Inhealthcare website states, *“In a 24 month follow up, 70 per cent of patients improved their time in therapeutic range by 20 per cent compared to in\-clinic monitoring, reducing the risk of stroke by a half”* \[S6\]. Time in Therapeutic Range increased by an average of 20% for 70% of those on the service and clinicians were able to spend more time with the most complex patients. On a video a nurse commented: *“We used to have clinics where we had 140 patients plus in a three hour period. We were doing our best and we were providing our best but we couldn’t provide the patients with that extra bit of care. Now the clinics are down to 70 – 80, and the patients who come through to the clinic are the ones who need our help”* \[S6\]. 

 **Improving the lives of patients** 

 Self\-testing is popular with patients. In the Inhealthcare video, the Business Development Manager at County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust said: *“Sustainability has been strong with 90% of patients who joined the programme three years ago still part of it. The reduction in appointments has lessened the impact on patients’ lives”* \[S6\]. 

 Anticoagulation UK \(ACUK\) is a small, dynamic charity in the UK that supports patients on warfarin and other anticoagulation therapies and were named stakeholders for the DG14 guidelines. ACUK confirmed that ‘ *NICE DG14 was the stepping stone for individuals to pursue the option of self\-monitoring*’ but state that further work is needed to accommodate a wider range of people with chronic thrombotic conditions. DG14 guidelines is used as the frame of reference to help direct patients seeking to receive support to self\-test \[S9i\]. Self\-testing has been found to empower patients, allowing individuals to manage their condition and take responsibility for their own health \[S9\]. 

 ACUK are in favour of self\-testing, as a result of the freedom that it brings to patients’ lives *.* Their website promotes a video in which Roy, a patient ambassador specifically mentions DG14 and the effect it has had on his life: *“I genuinely do feel in control. I can check my own INR levels when I feel I need to, \[..\]. Instead of taking time off work, I can just make a phone call and know my dose straight away so I saved my holidays for going on holiday* \[instead of going to the hospital\]” \[S9ii\]. 

 **Delivering commercial benefit** 

 Roche Diagnostics Ltd have derived commercial benefit as a direct result of the NICE DG14 recommendation to use the CoaguChek® product, which they manufacture. The CoaguChek XS was replaced by the CoaguChek INRange meter, launched in the UK in May 2017 \[S1i\]. The XS version of the device is still supported by the manufacturer and the testing strips are still available. The CoaguCheck INRange which uses Bluetooth technology, enables patients to wirelessly transmit INR results to their healthcare provider giving them freedom and a sense of empowerment. The instruments are now used by approximately 17,000 self\-test patients across the country. The Covid\-19 crisis prompted some clinical commissioning groups that were historically less keen on self\-testing to encourage its up\-take. \[ *text removed for publication*\] \[S4\]. 

 LumiraDx Care Solutions \(INRstar\) is the market leader in primary care provision of anticoagulation monitoring services. INRstar, designed by medical professionals has recently been licensed by LumiraDx as clinical decision support software, which enhances the safety and efficiency of point\-of\-care \- anticoagulation clinics, removing the burden on primary and secondary health care settings. INRstar is now used by 11,000 users across 2,700 practices and other locations in the UK, providing dosing regimens and recommendations for anti\-coagulation monitoring directly to patient systems. In order to enable patient self\-testing and empower self\-care, LumiraDx\-enabled INR support is available via the *engage* programme and supporting app, which allows remote testing, ensuring patients dose responsibly whilst communicating their results to their health professional. INRstar has enabled flexibility and freeing up clinical time, which aids both clinicians and patients in making anticoagulation services safer, effective and more cost efficient \[S10ii\]. 

  

 The *engage* programme cites DG14 both in its promotional material as justification for using the app and as evidence of the benefits of self\-monitoring, thereby increasing customer confidence and aiding the acceptability of it as a service \[S10ii\]. The Clinical Director of LumiraDx has confirmed that DG14 has acted as one of the reference points throughout the development of INRstar, providing both input on functionality and acting as a cross\-reference for suggestions of clinical action, thereby supporting decision\-making \[S10i\]. Since 2018, INRstar service/engage app is now used routinely by East Lancashire Hospital NHS Trust as well as NHS East Lancashire clinical commissioning group and five GP practices. Roche Diagnostics has supplied the handheld devices and training for patients under these programmes to send their INR result to their healthcare professional. Overall, cost savings to healthcare services are predicted at GBP123,612 over five years \(2018\-2023\) compared with usual costs of care for the 200 patients using the service \[S10iii\]. The *engage* programme has therefore enabled cost savings by developing a model around nurse clinics and healthcare assistants to reduce costs in point\-of\-care testing. 

 **Patient management during the coronavirus pandemic** 

 NHS England and NHS improvement released clinical guidance for the management of anti\-coagulant services during the current pandemic. It stated that 400,000 people had been prescribed Warfarin in the nine months prior to March 2020 \[S8\] and provided guidance on training patients to self\-test INR in their own homes. It cited the NICE guidance stating, *“While a move towards patient self\-testing will present challenges in terms of purchasing equipment, \[etc., it\] should be considered for patients/carers capable of doing this to minimise INR monitoring workload across the system”* \[S7\].

####  1. Summary of the impact 

 Proton\-beam therapy offers improved patient\-dose deposition over conventional radiotherapy, improving outcomes for patients through reduced side effects and making it particularly suited for paediatric treatments. University of Manchester \(UoM\) research underpinned the design, procurement plan and ongoing operation of the two bespoke, flexible and future\-proof NHS proton\-beam therapy treatment centres in Manchester and London, procured for a combined sum in excess of GBP250,000,000. 

 Commencing treatment in November 2018, the Christie Proton Therapy Centre at Manchester has treated approximately 400 patients, offering an estimated average 11.2 quality\-adjusted life\-years \(QALY\) per patient; 1.8 QALYs per patient greater than conventional radiotherapy. 

 These UK state\-of\-the\-art treatments have reduced the need for the previous provision of 200 annual overseas referrals, at a greatly reduced cost. This saved the NHS at least GBP60,000 per patient; it also opened up treatment to patients from a much wider demographic, including those too ill to travel. 
","
####  2. Underpinning research 

 UoM’s research programme has advanced proton therapy through a series of research projects. The 2012 Electron Model for Many Applications \(EMMA\) prototype particle accelerator GBP8,300,000 Basic Technology, led by Barlow with Owen and Kirkby\) developed a key technology needed for future rapid patient radiotherapy treatment **\[1\]** – the so\-called non\-scaling FFAG \(Fixed\-Field, Alternating Gradient\) accelerator. EMMA was the first demonstration of this technology, and improves upon industry\-standard cyclotrons by giving pulse\-by\-pulse energy variation of the accelerated particles \(and thereby depth variation\). Owen’s group made the key measurements that proved successful extraction and delivery of particle bunches. 

 The follow\-on Particle Accelerator for MEdicaL Applications \(PAMELA\) study \(Barlow, Owen, Kirkby\) **\[2\]** used the EMMA results to develop an FFAG\-based treatment facility proposal. Barlow led this study, which produced a comprehensive design for dual\-particle treatment \(protons or carbon ions\) and which developed a coherent specification for treatments in the UK, including the key attributes of fast energy switching and high\-energy availability \(see features \(3\), \(6\) and \(7\) in the impact section\). Whilst industry\-standard cyclotrons are limited to 250 MeV protons \(that can treat adult patients\), PAMELA is capable of 350 MeV proton delivery that enables more accurate proton\-based imaging of patients for more accurate treatment targeting \(see NHS specification **\[A\]**\). 

 The NOrmal\-conducting Racetrack Medical Accelerator \(NORMA\) project \(led by UoM – Owen and Appleby\) **\[3\]** developed the first design of an economic, proton\-only, 30–350 MeV FFAG accelerator, again to satisfy the NHS specification for proton imaging of patients; proton imaging allows more accurate imaging than conventional CT scans, leading to lower patient irradiation during treatment. The NORMA design used UoM\-developed computationally intensive code, which led to a more precise optimisation of the accelerator design than previously possible. This allowed the use of conventional normal\-conducting magnets \(maximum field <1.8 T\), offering an operationally simpler and cheaper alternative to superconducting designs such as the previous PAMELA. 

 Aitkenhead and Mackay **\[4\]** developed a Monte\-Carlo model to estimate quantitatively the throughput and waiting times of a single accelerator multi\-treatment\-room proton therapy facility. The model was validated against the MD Anderson Cancer Centre \(MDACC, USA\), demonstrating its accuracy and sensitivity to variance in parameters such as beam switch time, the number of treatment rooms, and patient set\-up times. The model studied the UK\-specific scenario of a more complex patient caseload \(greater number of paediatric patients requiring general anaesthesia\), specifying a 19% lower throughput than MDACC but maintaining an eventual capacity of 750 patients per year. 

 Burnet, Mackay and Kirkby, as part of the National Cancer Research Institute Clinical and Translational Radiotherapy Research Working Group \(CTRad\) **\[5\]**, developed an eight\-point framework to assist the development and delivery of high\-quality Proton\-Beam Therapy \(PBT\) clinical trials. This involved identifying the most appropriate endpoints, methodologies and translational elements for each clinical trial. The work also defined the need to involve patients and carers as well as key government and funder stakeholders from the outset and to establish a multidisciplinary framework involving researchers from the clinic and academia. 

 Mee and Kirkby **\[6\]** conducted an in\-depth review of the available modelling approaches for estimating service demand, patient numbers, and individual patient selection, highlighting areas of under\-referral. Using Office of National Statistics \(ONS\) national cancer incidence data and population data, it enabled NHS scenario planning and an assessment of the heterogeneity of cancer incidence and referral. For example, it assessed the effect of changing clinical indications upon PBT demand, and the impact on radiotherapy and surgery if regional screening programmes were rolled out nationally. It is also being used to identify the bottlenecks that lead to increased waiting times for cancer care.

####  4. Details of the impact 

#####  Pathway to impact 

 In 2010, the NHS began a review of the technical case to bring proton\-beam therapy \(PBT\) to the UK. In 2011, by virtue of the successes of 2006\-2012 EMMA **\[1\]** and 2006\-2013 PAMELA **\[2\]** projects, Owen was invited to write a review with the Science and Technology Facilities Council \(STFC\) for the then Department of Health \(DoH\), which formed part of the technical specification for the UK proton therapy service **\[A, B\]**.  Building on his research in biological modelling of conformal therapy and capacity planning, Mackay was appointed technical director for the Christie PBT service **\[C\]**. Christie Hospital and the NHS decided the procured PBT system should come from established suppliers to obtain short timescales for commencing a treatment service. They also wanted to purchase a bespoke set\-up suitable for the broadest range of complex treatments, which would remain state\-of\-the\-art **\[D\]**. Between 2013 and 2018, Owen \(as part of a three\-person advisory group\) co\-wrote the technical specification for the non\-standard FFAG accelerator system **\[D\]**. An FFA \(Fixed Field Accelerator\) allows rapid cycling of the beam energy to permit fast energy layer changes in beam delivery, and hence greater patient throughput. The team wrote the specification based on their research expertise **\[1\-4\]** and the DoH review; Mackay led the procurement with Owen acting as advisor. 

#####  Impacts on policy and the delivery of professional services 

 In December 2013, the NHS Review on bringing PBT to the UK was published **\[A\]**. The input of advisors Owen and Mackay to the Review was crucial in defining the specifications of the PBT facilities that the NHS procured. Owen and Mackay specified future delivery of higher\-energy protons for treatment with imaging **\[3\]**. The strength of their arguments, backed up by their research **\[1\-4\]**, made clear the benefits of investing heavily in non\-standard features \(\(1\) to \(7\) below\), each of which were included in the final specifications and are now part of the two completed facilities: The Christie Hospital Manchester and University College London Hospital \(UCLH\). These non\-standard features included: 

-  Fast scanning and fast \(ideally sub\-second\) energy switching for Intensity\-Modulated Proton Therapy \(IMPT\) **\[1, 2, 3, 4\];** 

-  Use of gantries \(to assist IMPT\) over fixed treatment lines **\[4\];** 

-  Spot scanning \(to assist IMPT\) over ordinary passive scattering **\[3\];** 

-  Using a cyclotron source, which has allowed high\-intensity treatment upgrades as originally foreseen **\[4\]\[D, E\];** 

-  Construction of a research beamline at the Christie centre to support and develop facility and treatment upgrades \(future\-proofing the facility\); 

-  High\-energy options for imaging and proton radiography/tomography **\[1, 2, 3\];** 

-  High\-intensity and high\-energy compact proton accelerators **\[1, 2, 3\].** 

 Mackay’s Monte\-Carlo \(MC\) model **\[4\]** specified the installed one\-accelerator/three\-treatment\-room setup, optimised to ensure the highest possible patient throughput with UK treatment protocols \(a world\-leading 250 patients per year per room\). The reliability of the MC model has further served to mitigate financial risk and consequent successful operation of the facility and has facilitated the world’s fastest patient\-service ramp\-up of paediatric capacity **\[D\]**. Additionally, the patient selection research **\[6\]** sets the policy framework for patients at Christie. CTRad has similarly set a policy for clinical trials **\[5\]** within which the Christie will be working. Together, these papers set the overall UK method for NHS patient selection and treatment used currently **\[F\]**. 

#####  Economic impact 

 The inclusion by Owen and Mackay of each non\-standard feature \(1\-7\) represented an overall GBP13,000,000 addition to each of the Christie and ULCH project budgets, contributed heavily to the NHS’s total investment into their two PBT facilities exceeding GBP250,000,000, but guaranteed future\-proofed treatments. This was the largest single financial investment in NHS history **\[D\]**. 

 Unlike comparable procurements, no legal challenges by competing manufacturers were levied against their decision. The unique detail of the facilities’ specifications, developed in part by Owen and Mackay, left no ambiguity about the criteria for selection of supplier. This was central to NHS England’s strategy to avoid costly and time\-consuming legal challenges. Such challenges typically cost upwards of GBP500,000 and can delay the beginning of a project by at least 12 months. 

 Unlike most PBT facilities, where service provision of equipment is effectively frozen at the point of purchase, each non\-standard feature has ensured capability for future treatment, effectively future\-proofing the service provision by facilitating adaptation or modification of the infrastructure, to introduce or pioneer innovative treatments at the clinical forefront. Previous generation patient\-specific hardware cost typically over GBP2,000 per patient; specifying spot scanning \(3\) eliminates this to save over GBP800,000 so far on 400 patients **\[D\]**. It also reduces average per\-patient overseas costs from over GBP100,000 to less than GBP45,000 **\[D\]**. Whilst the procurement of these facilities represented the largest investment in NHS history, we \(with the NHS\) are confident that the purchase of a future\-proofed facility represents a better investment long term than constructing new facilities for each subsequent generation of PBT treatment. 

 The research beamline facility \(point 5 above\), led by Kirkby, contains a clinically\-equivalent scanned proton beamline representing a GBP15,000,000 investment split between infrastructure, equipment and staff time \(a full time staff complement of over 30 people **\[G\]**\). In May 2020, as the only infrastructure of its type, the research line demonstrated the feasibility of radiation oncology treatment manufacturer Varian’s new dosimetry instrument key to enabling FLASH \(Ultra\-High Dose Rate\) therapy, an approach seen as the next\-generation proton treatment and a paradigm shift in radiotherapy **\[E\]**. As a result of this development Varian have increased spending in this field by \[text removed for publication\] **\[E\]**. 

#####  Impact on health and wellbeing 

 Inclusion of the non\-standard features has allowed the NHS to offer state\-of\-the\-art treatments not available with a ‘standard’ facility. For example, features \(1\) and \(2\) have allowed for treatment of craniospinal cancers on paediatric patients under anaesthesia, accommodating for movement in the patient, which is not possible using older passive scanning methods. Specification of spot\-scanning \(3\) eliminated the need for costly patient\-specific hardware and offers personalised, adaptive and more conformal treatments than would otherwise have been available. 

 The first NHS centre to offer full\-body proton therapy started treatments in November 2018 at Christie, to be joined by a second centre at UCLH in summer 2021. After the first two years, over 400 patients have received treatment **\[H\]** at Christie as operation ramps up as planned to 750 per year. Whilst long\-term analysis of this cohort is not yet available, the literature suggests an improvement of 11.2 quality\-adjusted life\-years \(QALY\) per patient from proton therapy; 1.8 additional QALYs to each patient compared to conventional radiotherapy **\[A\]**. The NHS previously referred patients overseas for PBT: approximately 200 per year. The provision of domestic treatment allows for more PBT referrals as it offers the opportunity for treatment to a range of patients who would be ineligible for treatment abroad due to the health and wellbeing challenges posed by international travel **\[A, D\]**. Of the patients treated at the Christie facility, 20% would not have received equivalent quality treatment at alternative international centres because of different provisions of service, and 10% would have been ineligible for treatment due to restrictions on travel **\[C, H\]**. The efficient procurement of a high\-capacity, domestic service has preserved PBT of UK patients during the unprecedented time of restricted international travel caused by COVID\-19.

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Varieties of Insular Norman, present in the Channel Islands for over 1,000 years, are now obsolescent, and the Norman variety of Jersey \(Jèrriais\) is spoken by only some 0.5% of the population. Mari Jones’s initiatives, featuring widely in local media, have focused on the documentation and preservation of Jèrriais and on influencing language policy. Jones has collaborated in language planning initiatives, playing a role in the decision to make Jèrriais an ‘official language’ and ensuring that the language is taught in schools. Her engagement with residents, educators and policymakers has raised awareness and demonstrated the importance of Jèrriais to local identity. She has also built valuable links between language experts in Jersey and the wider language planning community, encouraging them to preserve and revitalise the language. Recognition of her expertise and reputation has led to her being invited by the States of Guernsey to advise on Guernsey’s language revitalisation initiatives, thereby extending the reach of her impact in Jersey.

1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Spence \(1984:351\) observed that ‘unless there is a miracle, the local vernaculars \[of the Channel Islands\] will have disappeared completely within fifty years, and probably even earlier’. A negative attitude has been largely responsible for this decline. From the late 19th century, English started to displace Insular Norman, owing to trade and other links. Anglicization was further strengthened by the German Occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II, when significant numbers were evacuated to mainland Britain. On their return, the evacuees had either forgotten their Norman or had chosen to abandon it in favour of English. Since the War, the development of tourism, and immigration resulting from Jersey’s growing offshore finance industry, have also contributed to the spread of English. 

 Jones \(Professor of French Linguistics and Language Change\) was the first to examine the Norman speech of the Channel Islands within the framework of current linguistic theory. Her research has been crucially important because these languages are declining so rapidly that they are unlikely to be spoken for much longer. According to the 2001 census \(p10\), the number of Jèrriais speakers halved between 1989 and 2001 to 2,784. There are now fewer than 500 native speakers, according to the *Office du Jèrriais* \(as at November 2020\). Had Jones’s research not taken place, much linguistic knowledge about Jèrriais would have been lost forever. 

 Jones’s peer\-reviewed publications include the first monograph to comprehensively study Jersey Norman French **\[R1\]**, a monograph examining how contact between Norman and its two typologically different superstrates, French and English, has led to linguistic divergence between Mainland and Insular Norman **\[R2\]** and a book chapter on the effect of language contact on personal pronouns in Mainland and Insular Norman **\[R3\]**. She has published an article analysing the structural mechanisms of language loss in Jèrriais **\[R4\]**, an article exploring how emergent French linguistic norms are transferred into Mainland Norman **\[R5\]** and an article on current planning initiatives to revitalise Jèrriais **\[R6\]**. She has conducted a detailed analysis of the linguistic features of Jèrriais, providing data which have been compared phonetically, structurally and lexically to other varieties of Norman spoken in Guernsey, Sark and Mainland Normandy **\[R2\]**. The originality of Jones’s research within language death theory lies in the distinction it draws between language and dialect death; in its combination of historical\-linguistic and sociolinguistic perspectives; and its empirical demonstration, for the first time, of \(a\) the language change undergone by Insular Norman as a result of being spoken in high\-contact situations and \(b\) the linguistic divergence occurring between Insular and Mainland Norman caused by the former being in contact with English and the latter with French. 

 Jones’s publications have used original data to reinforce the fact that all three extant varieties of Insular Norman are distinct from one another and of great value to the fields of French dialectology and language change. These data, which include 80 hours of recordings, represent the largest pan\-Insular Norman corpus ever compiled and are a vital source for the linguistic analysis of Insular Norman. To gather this knowledge, Jones has engaged actively and in a sustained manner with the native\-speaker community of Jersey since 1996. There are no remaining monolingual speakers of Jèrriais, so there is a real danger that the language will disappear without immediate efforts to preserve it. Jones’s reputation as an internationally\-acknowledged expert on Insular Norman, generated by her publications, have led to her being respected in Jersey and thus being invited by the local speech community to engage at an official level with politicians and other public figures to promote their native language and keep it alive.

1.  **Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Norman French has been spoken in Jersey \(Channel Islands\) for over 1,000 years. Today, however, Jèrriais is obsolescent: spoken by some 0.5% of the population \(c. 500 speakers, of whom about 100 speak it as their everyday language\). Jones’s research has changed the way the inhabitants of Jersey think about Jèrriais and has strengthened efforts to preserve the language. Jones’s impact work has three strands which complement and reinforce each other: preserving and documenting the language; advising and informing local policymakers; and raising cultural awareness. By documenting and studying the language, Jones has not only created a valuable resource but also highlighted the value of Jèrriais to policy makers and raised its status amongst local speakers and their communities. Jones’s work has contributed significantly to passing key pieces of legislation which have helped preserve the language, ensuring that it continues to be taught in schools. Ultimately, her initiatives have played a significant role in the decision to make Jèrriais an official language in Jersey. Jones’s earlier achievements were recorded in a REF2014 case study.  In the current REF cycle she has produced significant new impacts. Beneficiaries include those who study and teach Jèrriais in Jersey and beyond, native speakers of Jèrriais and their local community, school teachers and pupils on the island, as well as local government officials and policymakers \(the latter in Guernsey also\). 

 **Impact on Language Preservation** 

 Since 1996, Jones has recorded native Jèrriais speakers to preserve and document the language and to study it while this is still possible. The 35 hours she has recorded constitute the largest corpus of Jèrriais compiled to date and form part of her larger pan\-Insular Norman corpus \(80 hours\). These recordings have been made available to *L’Office du Jèrriais*, a body that promotes and teaches Jèrriais, as reference data for the development of pedagogical material. 

 As part of her ongoing engagement with the Jèrriais community, Jones co\-launched ‘Jèrriais Today’, a sustainable language documentation project \(2017\-18\), with Dr Julia Sallabank \(SOAS, University of London\). Together, they co\-ran workshops in Jersey to train locals to record native speakers. Twenty\-six speakers were recorded in this project, which has helped create networks between learners and native speakers within the community. Its significance is attested by States of Jersey’s Cultural Development Officer: ‘the project to produce a recorded archive of spoken Jérriais has been launched to such enthusiasm from the local community…It is clear, as a result of your \[Jones’s\] persuasive advocacy, that a very committed team has been mobilised comprising not only those involved in teaching and studying the language but a much wider constituency of people who has responded to the invitation to become involved in preserving a unique aspect of Jersey’s culture… It is truly a community venture.’ **\[E1\]** 

###  Impact on Language Policy 

 Resulting from sustained engagement with the community to develop Jèrriais resources, government officials took notice of the significance of Jones’s research, especially regarding community identity and heritage preservation. For instance, Jersey’s Senior Language Support Officer notes: ‘Mari Jones has been a long\-standing supporter of our effort to maintain the Jèrriais language. She has helped us for many years in developing our policy for the language…. Her contribution is a vital part of the continuing struggle to prevent its imminent extinction’ **\[E2\]**. This recognition has led to Jones’s active engagement with policymakers, playing a prominent role in changing Jersey’s language policy on three occasions since 2016. 

###  I\) Jones helped to introduce and ensure the continuing provision of Jèrriais language teaching in Jersey’s primary schools. At the invitation of *L’Office du Jèrriais*, in 2016 Jones gave six presentations to audiences in the island, including Jersey’s Chief Minister, Assistant Chief Minister, Lieutenant Governor, Bailiff,  politicians, Jersey Heritage, Jersey Tourism *, La Société Jersiaise*, headmasters and the general public, including parents \[E3\]. These presentations were mentioned explicitly by several politicians debating an amendment to Jersey’s Medium\-Term Financial Plan 2017\-19, which was carried unanimously by 42 votes \(27th September 2016\) and committed funding for an additional teacher of Jèrriais. The impact, recorded in Hansard, includes: ‘the most telling point that struck me \[…\] was the presentation \[...\] Dr. Mari Jones. It was interesting for a Welsh lady to come to Jersey and say that here we have a living example of a language that has been around for 1,000 years that has, \[…\] set the foundations for modern English words. That is why I have absolutely no problem in supporting this’ \( *Deputy Le Fondré*\) \[E4\]. In 1998, during the REF2014 cycle, Jones had helped draft a report and proposition to teach Jèrriais in Jersey’s primary schools for the first time, which was implemented in 1999. Impacts continued during the REF2021 cycle: by June 2016, the retirement of two of the three Jèrriais teachers meant future provision was uncertain. Jones’s work on local educational policy and funding has ensured that teaching of Jèrriais continues in school to this date, increasing pupils’ awareness of their linguistic and cultural heritage \[E5\]. As a direct result of this policy change and increased funding, the number of Jèrriais learners in schools grew from 42 in September 2017 to 164 by September 2019 \[E5\] p.10. 

 II\) The States of Jersey asked Jones to help draft the 2017\-2019 Jèrriais Plan, presented on 16th June 2017 **\[E6\]**. Its aim of preserving, and increasing the visibility of, Jèrriais in the island was instrumental in creating the context for the key strategic language debate \(\[III\] below\) and laying the foundations for one 30\-minute weekly Jèrriais lesson available to all schoolchildren in Years 4\-6 once the new teachers were trained linguistically. As stated in a letter from Senator Jean Le Maistre, ‘A Jérriais Language Plan, which .... Dr Jones endorse\[d\] formally, was drawn up in the early months of 2017 and taken to the Council of Ministers for consideration in April. The plan to increase the teaching team to four was unanimously approved on 19th April \[2017\]…The longer term aim is to increase the teaching staff further, to enable the Jèrriais programme to be expanded into secondary schools.’ **\[E7\]**. 

 III\) Deputy Jeremy Maçon invited Jones to help write a case for a debate on language policy held in the States of Jersey \(12th February 2019\) **\[E8\]**. Resulting from the debate, two propositions were carried **\[E8\]** p.109 \- with 39 votes for 6 against: i\) Jèrriais would, for the first time, become an official language of the States; ii\) Jèrriais would be included on all official letter headings used in the public sector and on all new public signs. Hansard records an acknowledgement of Jones’s work by Deputy Maçon and a statement from Jersey’s Chief Minister that this work has made him think differently about Jèrriais: ‘We \[…\] had a presentation from Professor Jones who is obviously a specialist in languages particularly, including Jèrriais, and the presentation she made to us is that you have a 1,000 year\-old language, a living language, and if you do not do anything about it, it will die on your watch. That really struck home \[…\] if it sends a message to say: “Yes, you can have the ability to speak it in our Assembly” then maybe we should go for it \[…\] I will certainly be supporting this amendment’ **\[E8\]** p.101. Prominent island officials had never before given such recognition to Jèrriais, raising its status considerably. 

 **Impact on Cultural Awareness** 

 Jones’s work has impacted civil society and cultural life by helping address the profile of Jèrriais within Jersey. It has raised awareness of the prevalence of Jèrriais in everyday environments and has helped locals appreciate its relevance to their cultural identity. From 2001 onwards, she has given invited lectures to the general public in Jersey, with exit questionnaires demonstrating that islanders feel differently about their linguistic heritage and understand the need to preserve it. For example, one member of the public attending a talk in June 2016 noted being ‘more aware of the value of Jèrriais to my heritage and of its relevance to life today’ **\[E3\]** p.2; another attendee felt ‘inspired’ and ‘more determined to preserve it’ **\[E3\]** p.21. One talk at Jersey Museum in June 2016 led directly to a request for Jèrriais language lessons from members the Jersey Heritage Living History Team who had attended and felt inspired to learn and preserve the language **\[E3\]** pp. 142\-144. A talk entitled ‘Why should we bother about Jèrriais?’ at the Jersey Public Library on 7th April 2016 attracted 26 attendees compared to the usual average attendance of five. Public engagement was also undertaken via special events including ‘Taking Jèrriais into tomorrow’ \( *Société Jersiaise*, 23rd May 2018, 56 attendees\); ‘Jersey’s Linguistic Heritage: an evening with Mari Jones’ \(Jersey Heritage, 24th May 2018; 63 attendees\), and ‘A conversation with Mari Jones’ \(during the first Jersey Language Festival 27th September 2018; 57 attendees\). 

 Jones’s research has also impacted public discourse through local media coverage **\[E9\]**. Media interviews on BBC Radio Jersey \(reaching 27,000 weekly listeners in February–December 2019\) **\[E9\]** pp.1\-4 and in the *Jersey Evening Post* \(with a reach of 270,000 unique monthly visitors online\) **\[E9\]** pp.5\-8 exemplify the public debate on the value of keeping Jèrriais alive. Jones’s work also led to an invitation to be the first non\-islander to be guest speaker at the *Assembliée d’Jèrriais* lunch \(April 9th 2017; 78 attendees\). The first *Fête du Jèrriais* \(Jersey French awareness week\) took place in September 2018 and included a talk by Jones. This event was organised by one of the Jèrriais teachers, whose funding Jones had helped to secure via talks to States members. The Fête was attended by the Chief Minister of Jersey **\[E9\]** p.9 and other local policymakers. Their social media posts **\[E9\]** pp.10\-13 attest to the importance of Jones’s role in raising awareness of Jèrriais and their resulting enthusiasm for language preservation. States member Kirsten Morrel tweeted “Superb presentation by Prof Mari Jones about this being the last chance to save jerriais. It’s more than just our language, it’s our culture and history.” **\[E9\]** p.11 

 While Jones had no direct involvement in the following initiatives, the increasing interest in Jèrriais can clearly be seen in the fact that the Office du Jèrriais has created new resources, with three picture books translated and distributed to over 3,000 children in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The number of café conversation groups rose from one in 2018 \(St Helier\) to three in 2020 \(St Helier, St Ouen, St Martin\) **\[E5\]** p.10. 

 **Wider impacts on language preservation** 

 Jones’s fundamental contribution to the promotion of Jèrriais showcases her long\-standing engagement with minority languages across the Channel Islands. A case in point is the significant advisory role she played in the recent award of GBP300,000 by The Committee for Education, Sport & Culture \(Guernsey\) to support the establishment of a Guernsey Language Commission, which underpins the substantial reach of her impacts. In a personal letter, the President of the Committee expresses his ‘grateful thanks for the considerable expertise you have provided which has been invaluable in supporting the Committee’s efforts to reach this pivotal milestone in the history of our Guernsey language.’ **\[E10\]**. This demonstrates the influence of Jones’s work on policy\-making and language preservation beyond Jersey. 

 Jones encourages and provides opportunities for Jèrriais teachers to engage with the wider language planning community via conferences she has organised \(2011, 2012, 2016, 2018, 2019\) and academic volumes she has edited \(2013, 2015, 2017\). One attendee explains how this knowledge exchange and engagement with the international language preservation community has profoundly benefitted his work teaching and promoting Jèrriais: ‘Attending the conference has been instrumental in allowing me to develop my understanding of language endangerment and how it can be addressed….To be able to engage in discussion about the range of methodologies being employed throughout the world to keep our precious languages alive has inspired my work in revitalising Jèrriais.’ He also describes Jones’s vital contribution to language preservation: ‘It has become clear to me that Jèrriais would almost certainly be in a more precarious situation were it not for the support of Professor Mari Jones.’ **\[E11\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in 2014 was the largest outbreak of this severe and often fatal disease. Tackling the disease was hampered by social and cultural factors. Fairhead’s research helped establish the Ebola Response Anthropology Platform \(ERAP\) in 2014 to feed anthropological research into the humanitarian response in West Africa that informed case identification, burials, care, clinical trials, communications and community engagement, and addressed social resistance and violence against health workers. This shaped policy as ERAP was adopted as a social science sub\-group of the UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) and altered community engagement practices that resolved social stand\-offs on the ground \(e.g. in Guinea\). Three UK Parliamentary Inquiries into the Ebola response highlighted ERAP’s contributions and the areas of Fairhead’s expertise within it. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Fairhead began conducting environmental anthropological research in the Republic of Guinea in 1991 and turned to medical anthropological research there in 2003. The research involved two programmes that examined how parents sought healthcare for infants, and the place of routine infant immunization and vaccine research within this. He was Principal Investigator on an ESRC grant evaluated by them as ‘Outstanding’ \[G1 – see Section 3\], and Co\-Investigator on a DFID funded programme \[G2\]. Research was joint with Professor Melissa Leach at the Institute of Development Studies \(IDS\) and in Guinea with its Ministry of Health. He had thus conducted intermittent fieldwork over two decades living among communities in the Forest Region of the Republic of Guinea where, in December 2013, the Ebola epidemic began. 

 His book *Vaccine Anxieties* \[3.1 based on G1 and G2\] had documented how existing ideas about the causes of health and disease affect attitudes towards vaccination, but it showed too how other factors shaped attendance and ‘compliance’ linked to politics, poverty and structural violence. These ranged from the broader political experience that affected trust in vaccines to the micro\-political experience of mothers on immunization days, such as the chastisement by nurses after they unavoidably missed appointments or the shame felt by mothers whose babies were not thriving. In particular, he revealed how international health interventions – such as vaccination campaigns that are disconnected from nationally administered routine services – invite suspicions. These insights were particularly important when advising on addressing and avoiding the social friction that emerged between the humanitarian intervention in response to Ebola and existing health seeking and care practices \[3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]. 

 Fairhead’s research was couched in broader ethnographic\-derived understandings of the life course \(birth, childhood, adulthood and death\), the ritual practices associated with these changes and the cosmological considerations concerning the parallel world to which the dead might go, from which infants may come. In particular, he showed how many people in this region can attribute the causes of illness to improper or immoral conduct or to ancestral and spiritual forces, and how the men’s and women’s initiation institutions \(sodalities\), that order political life, also oversee such social conduct, including burial and relations with the dead \[3.2\]. These sodalities \(that are secret to outsiders\) are thus as central to managing health, illness and prosperity in this region as they are to the organisation of political life. Deeply\-felt social and political tensions and misunderstandings emerged when the national and international Ebola response sought to exert control over the critically ill and the burial of the dead, and imposed their version of what was a ‘safe and dignified burial’. Social practices around burial thus became critical to understanding local reactions to the humanitarian Ebola response, and to strategies to avoid the reticence and violent resistance that it encountered \[3.2\]. 

 Fairhead’s research also examined how parents and communities in West Africa interpret and experience medical research trials into immunization \[3.5, 3.6\]. This research provided insights concerning local understandings of immunity important for communication, and explained sensitivities to medical practices, such as blood taking and how this can often be interpreted locally as stealing \[3.6\], that were both important issues in the roll\-out of Ebola vaccine trials during the epidemic. These issues became central to understanding how to develop securitised burials for Ebola to avoid ‘super spreading’ events \[3.2, 3.3\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 From 2014 to 2016, Ebola in West Africa left 11,000\+ dead and 17,000\+ survivors struggling with devastating social, economic and medical consequences. In 2014, the public health response faltered for a variety of reasons, many of which were social and cultural \(such as those associated with mortuary and burial practices\), but which were also political and economic \(as the sodalities managing burial practices in the region are also central to securing prosperity, to its political organization and indeed, mobilization against historic economic marginalization\). Fairhead’s existing research insights allowed him to see why many aspects of the humanitarian response were being perceived locally as a threat, not a relief, and how better community relations could inflect the humanitarian response to make it more efficient and effective. In September 2014, Fairhead united leading UK medical anthropologists \(Leach, Kelly, Parker\) and together initiated a collaborative ‘Ebola Response Anthropology Platform’ \(ERAP\) that could focus wider global expertise on this problem. ERAP became a focal point to feed social analysis proactively into the escallating medical response and offered real\-time advice to the needs raised by medical and humanitarian responders as the unprecedented and uncertain events unfolded \[5.1\]. 

 From October 2014, ERAP delivered advice derived from anthropological research to policy and implementing organisations across the region on topics including: diagnosis, caring for the sick, managing the dead, interfaces with research trials, and strategies to improve communication and engagement. It proactively mailed reports to emergent and coalescing response networks and provided rapid support to organisations that solicited its advice. ERAP liaised with medical anthropology colleagues in Europe, the US and Africa to develop common purpose, coordinate and provide mutual support. It became ‘co\-opted’ \(formally and at DFID’s invitation\) in October 2014, as the “Anthropology and Social Science Sub\-Group” of the UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) chaired by Professor Chris Whitty – so doubling as a formal UK Government Committee directly advising the Government’s Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientist and, through this, informing DFID and MOD decision\-making as they grappled with the unprecedented and uncertain realities of the Ebola crisis. For example, the Africa APPG noted: *“The platform … has fed directly into the UK’s response at the community level with anthropologists working with leaders from ‘resisting’ villages”* \[5.2\]. 

 ERAP authored 40 rapid response briefings solicited by DFID, the Ministry of Defense, WHO, UNMEER, Christian Aid and others, uploaded to its website that drew 16,000\+ users. These contributed in real\-time, through a suite of recommendations, to guidelines, protocols, face\-to\-face discussions and operational workshops on a range of Ebola response activities \[5.1\]. 

 Those in which Fairhead was particularly involved concerned: Social Resistance to the Humanitarian Response; Safe and Dignified Burials \(for DFID and WHO\); Community Engagement and Behaviour Change \(for DFID, MOD and WHO\), and Stigma and Survivors \(DFID\) \[5.3, 5.7\]. He prepared a report and briefings explaining the social logics of the healthcare and mortuary practices that were so central to Ebola transmission and which had become key, too, to the often violent resistance that Ebola response teams faced, which had rendered some areas ‘off\-limits’ \[5.2\]. On the ground, for example, when a team faced a “ *cluster of Ebola cases that were hiding in the forest, refusing external help*” they accessed Fairhead’s study on the resistance to the Ebola response and “ *Understanding these perceptions informed the communication strategy to include community leaders and influential local key\-speakers \(e.g. survivors\) in all communication activities*” \[5.4\]. Such insights altered both high\-level policy and practices on the ground. Concerning policy, for example, his advice during the epidemic concerning funerary rites helped DFID *“adapt practices to maintain the essence and symbolism without exposing those attending”* \[5.5\]. 

 Fairhead’s proactive and responsive briefings concerning the sensitivities surrounding burial practices and the stigmatisation of survivors – supplemented also by his translations from French of other key anthropological works – fed directly into DFID’s support to burial policy and practice \[5.10\]. This was incorporated en bloc into the UK Government Health & Education Advice & Resource Team \(HEART\) report \[5.6\], and through this into UK \(and global\) Ebola response via DFID and MOD \[5.5, 5.7, 5.9\]. These insights fed directly into MOD briefings \(e.g. \[text removed for publication\]\) helping UK military support for health interventions to orient to social and cultural realities \[5.7\]. 

 ERAP also questioned the initial parallel institutionalization of Ebola response separate from existing trusted health and community structures, and early communication strategies, that were both experienced by communities as threatening, patronising or disrespectful and which undermined trust \(e.g. publication in *The Lancet* \[3.4\]\). These were critical messages that reshaped DFID’s approach \[5.5\] and that of the wider response. 

 ERAP showed why Ebola could only be contained with the explicit involvement and active participation of local communities, what this might involve, and how this could be achieved. Working across disciplines and with policymakers and practitioners, it generated the atmosphere of a moving workshop, brainstorming the unprecedented challenges that the unfolding Ebola crisis posed, feeding into the highest\-level fora. 

 ERAP achieved unprecedented recognition of the relevance of anthropological research for humanitarian emergencies, winning the ESRC award for international impact in 2016 that itself funded research by students from Ebola\-affected countries \[5.8\]. Two UK Parliamentary inquiries \(and evidence to them from The Wellcome Trust, the Africa APPG, DFID\) testified to the important role ERAP played in controlling and ending the Ebola epidemic \[5.9a & b\]. The Science and Technology Committee, in its final report, singled out the areas of work that Fairhead led on, stating how *: “Many of our witnesses emphasised that establishing the ‘Ebola Anthropology and Social Science sub\-Group of SAGE’ and ensuring that the membership of SAGE included social scientists, was ‘extremely important in controlling \[the\] outbreak’”*. \[5.9b\] 

 Professor Chris Whitty \(then Chief Scientific Adviser at the UK Department for International Development overseeing the UK Ebola epidemic response, who convened and chaired the anthropology subcommittee of SAGE\) described social science as: *“important in almost every aspect of what we did”* in West Africa. This included understanding the *“history of inequalities and economic policies that left people distrustful of foreigners and the state in many areas”* as well as the *“social routes,”* such as burial practices, through which Ebola was transmitted \[5.9b\]. When Whitty published his reflections on *“the central role of the social sciences in addressing the crisis,”* he cited Fairhead’s work when stating that: *“Advice given by social scientists during the epidemic built on decades of work observing funerary rites and ways these could be adapted to maintain the essence and symbolism without exposing those attending.”* He also drew on ERAP’s publication \(Chandler et al. including Fairhead\) when stating that: 

 *“Fashioning a response and a communication strategy which ran with the grain of social beliefs and organization rather than against it again depended on insights from social scientists working in this area of West Africa. They self\-organized around an open anthropology platform which was invaluable to responders and policymakers and should be considered in any future outbreaks in any societies”* \[5.5\]. 

 The ERAP model brought anthropology and wider social sciences into epidemic and wider emergency preparedness. The Government Chief Scientist cited ERAP when calling for mechanisms to integrate social science evidence into addressing all global challenges \[5.10\]. Following their Inquiry, the International Development Committee recommended that: 

 *“In future outbreak responses, DFID must engage communities early and build community engagement into the fundamentals of its response. To assist with this, DFID should build its anthropological capacity and work with anthropologists in its work on strengthening health systems and on outbreak response. This would help it better understand the ways that people access and comprehend health services, so that it can build appropriately.”* \[5.9a\]. 

 In its formal response, the UK Government commended ERAP, confirming that: “ *the department recognised that supporting behaviour change through effective community engagement was absolutely key to reducing Ebola transmission, and made critical contributions to understanding relevant cultural practices*.” \[5.11\]. It concluded: 

 *“This model could be adapted for use in response to future crises, to ensure cultural, traditional and religious sensitivities are understood and fully taken account of...* *DFID has undertaken lesson learning following Ebola on how social science can help inform the evidence base for decision\-making. During each developing emergency, DFID discusses with Government Office for Science the need for social science expertise. Through this process social scientists are included on relevant scientific advisory groups informing HMG responses. DFID will continue to engage with a board* \[sic\] *range of social scientists as it strengthens its mechanisms for using science in international emergencies and disasters.”* \[5.11\]. 

 Now renamed the Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform \(SSHAP\) for this wider mission, Fairhead has since supported its briefings addressing the Ebola epidemic in Eastern DRC \(2018\-20\), and this platform model is now informing the COVID\-19 response \[5.12\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Problem gambling is a major issue worldwide with prevalence rates between 0.5%\-2% in most countries. NTU research into the many factors that contribute to problematic gambling behaviour has driven major developments in responsible gaming \(RG\) tools which reduce the risk of problem gambling. Professor Griffiths’ research has underpinned the design and continued optimisation of RG tools used by international gambling operators and regulators with a global reach of tens of millions of individuals, including: 

1.  *GAM\-GaRD,* adopted into the company social responsibility protocols of over 50 gambling operators and regulators in over 20 countries, and is stipulated countrywide in some cases; 

1.  *Mentor,* used by leading European gambling operators and independently evaluated as helping clients gamble more responsibly. 

 Griffiths research has also underpinned the national and international development of RG Codes of Conduct, including those implemented by the *Association of British Bookmakers* \(overseeing 85% of UK sports betting shops\) and the *China Sports Lottery* \(overseeing all 31 provinces in China\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2000, Griffiths has published over 30 research papers identifying the structural characteristics of games that encourage gambling. These include event frequency, stake size, size of the jackpot, speed of the game, and illusion of control elements \[ **R1**\]. Understanding elements associated with problematic play can help in harm minimisation and the design of safer games. This research formed the basis of the responsible gambling \[RG\] tool GAM\-GaRD \[Gambling Assessment Measure: Guidance about Responsible Design\] as follows: 

-  Griffiths’ research into the structural and situational characteristics \(i.e., features that are external to the gambler such as marketing, advertising, and the number of gambling venues in the environment\) of gambling pinpointed the most important factors associated with problem gambling and co\-developed GAM\-GaRD with Dr. Richard Wood \(CEO, GamRes, Canada\) to help game developers design more responsible lower\-risk games for vulnerable and susceptible individuals \(Funder: Camelot Plc £40,000\). This research began in 2006 and led to the commercial development of GAM\-GaRD\). 

-  In 2010, Griffiths and Wood developed the Responsible Gambling Impact Index \(commissioned by Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation CAD$250,000\), a tool which was designed for gambling operators to make well\-informed decisions about developing and implementing RG tools and features. The tool was based on situational characteristics \[ **R2**\] rather than the structural factors identified in GAM\-GaRD. The index was then incorporated into GAM\-GaRD and since the last REF cycle has been sold and licensed as GAM\-GaRD 2.0 in 2014. 

-  Subsequently, Griffiths’ research \(particularly on limit\-setting as a responsible gambling tool \[ **R3**\]\) was used in the development of GAM\-GaRD 3.0 in 2016 in which game risk scores on GAM\-GaRD could be mitigated by use of limit\-setting tools by gambling operators. In the last six years, the number of gambling operators using GAM\-GaRD has almost doubled. Furthermore, its national use across every province in China and Canada has led to significant increase in terms of reach since 2014. 

 With Dr Michael Auer \(former NTU PhD student\), Griffiths carried out a study in 2013 with 100,000 real online gamblers and developed a new measure of gambling intensity called ‘theoretical loss’ \[ **R4**\]. This measure was used as the basis for Griffiths’ subsequent research demonstrating the effectiveness of RG tools such as limit\-setting \[ **R4**\], pop\-up messaging \[ **R5**\], and personalised feedback \[ **R6**\] using ‘big data’ provided by the gambling industry. These are just three of the many studies that Griffiths has published showing that limit\-setting and bespoke personalized feedback are particularly effective in significantly reducing the amount of money spent by gambling\-intense individuals. As the Association of British Bookmakers note: 

 “*One of Professor Griffiths’ most valuable contributions was in the area of limit setting. His 2013 paper…is the only study to date carried out with real gamblers \(n=100,000\) in real time on a real gambling site \(win2day\), and demonstrated that limit setting is an effective responsible gambling tool for the most gambling intense players*,” \[ **S5**\]. 

 This research \[ **R4**\- **R6**\] also underpinned the development of another RG tool \(Mentor – developed by Griffiths and Auer between 2012 and 2014\) with Neccton, an Austrian data mining company with expertise in the European banking and gambling sector. Mentor provides personalised feedback to gamblers in real time about their gambling behaviour and is used by leading gambling operators across Europe including the Gauselmann Group \(Germany, Austria, Denmark\), Austrian Lotteries \(Austria\), ComeOn \(Sweden\), Greentube \(UK, Spain\), The Mill Adventure \(Sweden\) and Skillonnet \(UK, Denmark, Spain\). The tool provides gamblers with accurate information about their actual gambling behaviour \(e.g., time and money spent gambling\) across different time periods \(e.g., weekly, monthly, half\-yearly\) and also presents players with normative data from other gamblers in the database so that gamblers can compare their own behaviour with others and facilitate self\-appraisal and help enable behavioural change \[ **R5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Griffiths’ research has provided unique evidence for the development of two Responsible Gaming \(RG\) tools, GAM\-GaRD and Mentor, which have significantly changed day\-to\-day practices in world\-wide gambling operators, and underpinned UK and international codes of conduct which aim to significantly reduce problem gambling. The development and initial implementation of GAM\-GaRD formed part of a REF2014 impact case study, but its optimization in versions 2.0 and 3.0 and international implementation represents new impact with greater international reach and significance. The development and implementation of Mentor, and Griffiths’ influence on international codes of conduct are also new developments. Following his 2013 research, Griffiths was commissioned by the Association of British Bookmakers \(ABB \- £13,300 over three projects\) in 2013 and 2014 \[ **S6**\- **S8**\] to support the development of their Code of Conduct for Responsible Gambling \(which came into operation nationally from March 2015\). NTU research on limit\-setting was referenced in the Code and, consequently, a limit\-setting feature was included on every fixed\-odds betting terminal in every UK betting shop based on Griffiths’ research \[ **S5**\]. 

###  Optimisation and Adoption of GAM\-GaRD RG tool 

 GAM\-GaRD \(GAM\-GaRD 2.0 since 2014 and GAM\-GaRD 3.0 since 2016\) is a commercially available online tool used by gaming companies, and co\-developed by Griffiths. This tool assesses the ten most addictive characteristics of gambling games \(e.g. accessibility, prize\-back percentage, etc.\) and offers gaming operators practical ways to reduce the risks of gambling addiction by altering the game’s structural characteristics before marketing it. The World Lottery Association recommended that all its companies use such a tool as part of their social responsibility accreditation procedures \[ **S1**\]. The testimonial letter notes: “ *Dr. Griffiths’ research findings have been applied by many lottery companies around the world in improving their day\-to\-day practices in the areas of player protection and harm minimization including Camelot \(UK\), Premier Lotteries \(Eire\), Norsk Tipping \(Norway\), Veikkaus \(Finland\), Svenska Spel \(Sweden\), Danske Spil \(Denmark\), West Lotto \(Germany\), Austrian Lottery \(Austria\), Loterie Romande \(Switzerland\), Postcode Lottery \(The Netherlands\), Atlantic Lottery Corporation \(Canada\), Nova Scotia Provincial Lotteries and Casino Corporation \(Canada\), Interprovincial Lottery Corporation \(Canada\), and Singapore Pools \(Singapore\)*”. Additionally, the World Lottery Association recommends that all its member organisations \(combined revenue of $250bn across 80 countries\) use a tool such as GAM\-GaRD. 

 This latest version of GAM\-GaRD is now used by over 50 of the world’s biggest operators and gambling regulators in over 20 countries, including operators in Canada, UK, USA, China, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Poland, Morocco, Hong Kong, South Korea and Uruguay \[ **S2**\]. The tool is also used by gaming regulators \(e.g., Norway, Sweden, UK\).  In certain countries, \(e.g., Norway\) it is not possible to obtain gambling licences without GAM\-GaRD accreditation. In 2015, Canada bought a countrywide site license, and each state\-owned gambling company uses GAM\-GaRD \(i.e., a minimum of one gaming company in every Canadian province\). In 2019, the China Sports Lottery bought a countrywide license across all 31 provinces \(1.4 billion reach\). According to the General Manager of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, who also works for the China Sports Lottery ‘ *We wanted to use Professor Griffiths' long\-standing research expertise and experience to help us run our gambling business in a more social responsible way and for us to change and/or enhance our day\-to\-day policies on player protection and harm minimization*’ \[ **S9**\]. Beneficiaries include the tens of millions of gamblers in over 20 different countries playing games that have undergone rigorous GAM\-GaRD testing during the product development phase. Independent evaluation of GAM\-GaRD also highlighted how beneficial it had been for both gambling operators and regulators \[ **S3**\]. 

###  Development and introduction of Mentor RG tool 

 Griffiths and Auer also co\-developed the world’s first personalized messaging system \[Mentor, **S4**\] that uses gamblers’ online tracking data to provide bespoke information and feedback to gamblers about their wins, losses, deposits and time spent gambling. Since 2014, a number of operators in Europe now use this tool \(e.g. Germany, Austria, Spain, UK, Sweden and Norway\) \[ **S4**\]. The beneficiaries are the estimated five million gamblers who use Mentor as a way of reducing their risk of developing gambling problems \[ **S4**\]. 

###  Impact on UK and international regulators of commercial gambling 

 Griffiths’ research with Auer underpins the recent Association of British Bookmakers’ \(ABB\) Code of Conduct for Responsible Gambling \[ **S5**\- **S8**\]. A key consequence of this work is that since 2015, every fixed\-odds betting machine in every UK betting shop now allows players to set their own limits on how much time and/or money they want to spend gambling \[ **S5**\]. The research was instrumental in the ABB’s introduction of limit\-setting features on every FOBT. Beneficiaries of both the Code of Conduct and the specific responsible gambling tools are the 2.6 million gamblers who frequent British betting shops, and the hundreds of thousands of gamblers who specifically play FOBTs.  The Chief Executive of the Association of British Bookmakers states: 

 “*Professor Griffiths’ research is of great utility to the ABB and is used to help update our national policies regarding responsible gambling, social responsibility, player protection, and harm minimization*,” \[ **S5**\]. 

 Griffiths also won an international competitive tender by the Norwegian Government’s monopoly gaming operator to evaluate Norsk Tipping’s responsible gambling portfolio. To date, this research has assessed the efficacy of the company’s new \(i\) global loss limit \(introduced in November 2016\), \(ii\) the loss\-limit reminder informing players when they have reached 80% of their loss limits, and \(iii\) mandatory play breaks. As the operator notes: 

 “*Norsk Tipping have used these findings…to help the all gamblers \(currently more than two million players\) who play our games. Dr. Griffiths’ research has fed directly into all our constantly evolving player protection practices*,” \[ **S10**\]. 

 Griffiths was commissioned by the Hong Kong Jockey Club to help develop the China Sports Lottery’s codes of conduct in relation to player protection and harm minimization across all 31 provinces in China. Alongside this consultation, Griffiths ran a series of workshops in Beijing \(December 2018\) which led to the implementation of new policies and procedures across all 31 provinces in China \[ **S9**\]. 

 Ultimately, Griffiths’ research has played a critical role in the development of RG tools and RG Codes of Conduct across four continents. Testimonials demonstrate that these codes have informed the day\-to\-day practices of international gambling operators and that recommendations from Griffiths’ research has enhanced socially responsible practices with the aim of reducing problem gambling among tens of millions of gamblers.

 1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) research on quantifying anthropogenic effects on past, present and future climates and extreme weather events, underpins climate change policies worldwide, benefiting and protecting populations across the world, particularly those most vulnerable to climate change. In particular, estimates of the human contribution to recent warming, and of the climate sensitivity \(how much greenhouse gas emissions warm the climate\), were key contributions to the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\), which in turn had a large influence on Government commitments made in the 2015 Paris Agreement. UoE research on determining the human contribution to climate change, including to change in extreme events, influenced the 2016 report of the US National Academies on attribution of extreme weather events, which then influenced service provision on event attribution and national climate change policies in the UK and worldwide. 
","
 2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 UoE research has made crucial contributions to \(a\) estimating the human fingerprint in the climate system from observed change, and with it, the climate sensitivity \(how much greenhouse gas emissions warm the climate\), and \(b\) quantifying how changes in the frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events have already resulted from the changing climate \(event attribution\). 

##  \(a\) Human fingerprint and Climate sensitivity 

 The UoE team has played a significant role in determining key relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and climate warming. This has been achieved by world leading analysis synthesising multiple sources of evidence, including observed warming in the pre\- and post\-industrial period paleoclimate and instrumental records, and physical understanding derived from worldwide modelling approaches. This led to the quantification of the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity \(ECS\) ie the long\-term global mean temperature increase caused by a doubling of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration from records of the observed warming **\[3.1\]** and synthesized evidence from historical warming with that from analysis of global modelling and feedback processes **\[3.2\]**. Furthermore, the human fingerprint was detected in global precipitation patterns **\[3.3\]** and in widespread intensification of extreme precipitation **\[3.4\]**, confirming that human influence is changing mean and intense precipitation. These publications were used as evidence in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) reports. 

 Subsequent UoE research estimated the variation in the Earth’s pre\-industrial climate, attributing observed variations in climate to radiative forcing and estimating detectable greenhouse gas contributions to surface temperature from across the 19<sup>th</sup> century. This research is important because it is the baseline used by the IPCC to assess climate change stabilisation targets. Analysis of the pre\-industrial climate led the team to conclude that correcting this baseline reduced by up to 0.2 degrees the future further warming before the Paris Agreement targets are exceeded, with a corresponding reduction of up to 40% in the remaining future budget for carbon dioxide emissions **\[3.5\]**. 

##  \(b\) Event Attribution 

 The UoE team produced world\-leading research into the crucial task of validating the hypothesis that human\-caused climate change has changed both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. They have led the interpretation of results that found that increases in emissions of greenhouse gases have caused a 5% increase in extreme precipitation events across the globe, and have showed that human emissions have contributed to observed changes in large\-scale precipitation **\[3.4\]**, a finding further strengthened in recent follow\-up publications **\[3.6\].** This work underpins the attribution of recent extreme events highlighted in the National Academies report **\[5.5\].**

###  Informing the Paris Agreement 

 UoE research on the effect of increasing greenhouse gases on past and future climates and precipitation patterns has made vital contributions to reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) since August 2013, with the team’s “ *contribution to the IPCC and public policy”* judged *“substantial and a very good example of innovative and policy relevant research”* **\[5.1\].** The IPCC reports directly informed the international climate change negotiations which resulted in the 2015 United Nations Paris Agreement treaty on climate change. The Paris Agreement is the overarching global framework for addressing climate change, with 194 states and the European Union \(EU\) as signatories in 2015.  Of these, 187 states and the EU, representing about 79% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have now ratified or acceded to the Agreement. 

 Professor Hegerl was a lead author of the IPCC’s Working Group 1 Report on *Climate Change 2014 \- the Physical Science Basis*, published in June 2014 **\[5.2\]**. This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the physical science basis of climate change since 2007 when the Fourth Assessment Report \(AR4\) was released. She was selected for her role based on her scientific output on the causes of climate change. Among the IPCC authors she was selected for the author team of the AR5 Synthesis Report: *Climate Change 2014* **\[5.2\],** and led the section on observed emissions and changes in the climate in that report. The AR5 Synthesis Report \(approved in the IPCC plenary meeting in October 2014\), is the overarching and top\-level document of the IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report, which “ *was the scientific foundation for the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change”* **\[5.3\].** The Working Group 1 co\-chair describes her “ *seminal work that has transformed our field… you have pioneered the method to detect fingerprints of anthropogenic climate change combining observations and climate model simulations..this \[method\] has become one of the central pillars of climate science”* **\[5.3\]**. Altogether the IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report **\[5.2\]** contains 18 citations of Professor Hegerl, 2 of Professor Tett, 3 of Dr Polson and 1 of Dr Schurer \(allocated to first author listed only to avoid duplication\), and the Edinburgh team has provided 3 figures.  In particular, an update to **\[3.2\]** provided a key figure in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report, which was also reproduced in the Technical Summary as figure TFE6.1, and **\[3.1\- 3.6\]** are all cited in IPCC 5th Assessment Report, or the 1.5 degree special report **\[5.2\]**. 

 Professor Hegerl also led the Guidance Paper on attribution of observed climate change and impacts to causes for use across the IPCC’s working groups, which was widely used and cited in the overarching IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report. At the approval plenary for the report involving all the United Nations country delegations she presented the keynote presentation on climate sensitivity. This was one of only four key science presentations given to directly communicate the report’s findings to full plenary session of Government representatives **\[5.2, 5.3\]**. Professor Tett was selected to be an expert review editor for the 2014 IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report, Working Group I.  The former Head of Science at the Department of Energy and Climate Change describes the two key issues that the UoE team highlighted – climate sensitivity **\[3.1,3.2\]** and event attribution **\[5.5\]**, as “ *key policy issues which affect both the scale and urgency required of the response to climate change internationally… the agreement that was reached to limit the global temperature rise to 2C above pre\-industrial levels \(and to aim for as close to 1.5C as possible\) and achieve net zero emissions in the second part of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, drew directly on this and similar work”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 Following the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change requested advice from the IPCC on the target of limiting climate warming to 1.5 degrees C. The resulting 2018 landmark IPCC special report on *Global Warming of 1.5 degrees C* \(1.5C Report\), arguably one of the most important and influential reports in the IPCC’s history, cited four papers from UoE climate researchers, with findings from **\[3.5\]** applied directly in the calculation of the future emissions allowable without exceeding 1.5C warming. The 1.5C report has guided climate change policies across the globe including, via assessment by the UK Committee on Climate Change, the UK Parliament strengthening its climate target in June 2019 by passing legislation requiring the government to reduce the UK's net emissions of greenhouse gases by 100% relative to 1990 levels by 2050. This was described as the ‘ *defining decision of this generation in fulfilling our responsibility to the next*’ by Prime Minister Theresa May. **\[5.4\]**. 

###  Contribution to national policymaking 

 The UoE team’s research identifying human influence in extreme weather events has successfully engaged policymakers in the immediate risks and damages resulting from climate change. Professor Hegerl was on the committee \(one of ten\) that produced the 2016 US National Academies review on extreme weather event attribution **\[5.5\]**, which cites 10 of her papers \(5 as first author or principal supervisor; incl. **\[3.6\]**\) as well as the IPCC guidance document **\[5.2\]**. This report reached the major conclusion that it is now possible to identify the role of climate change in individual extreme events. The report is “ *by all metrics, \[…\] among the most impactful contributions of the National Academies in the past decade*” and was widely reported and communicated to US agencies and policymakers. It was downloaded more than 27,000 times by October 2020, ranking it as the most downloaded Earth Science report, and in the top 1% of all National Academies’ products. It was also covered by 300 news outlets, with “ *multiple mentions by leading outlets including the New York Times, Washington Post, Forbes and CNN”*. It was briefed to numerous audiences, including multiple US government agencies, staff from House and Senate committees, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. **\[5.6\]**. The report also underpinned the international development of an operational event attribution capability that can rapidly assess the factors contributing to extreme events. This “ *enables analyses to be completed quickly after an event, leading to more direct connection to climate change*” in media communication about an extreme event. The work was named as one of the top ten breakthrough technologies by the MIT Tech Review in 2020 **\[5.6\]**. Professor Hegerl also wrote the section on changes in climate extremes of the Climate Updates report by the Royal Society. This was used to inform policymakers ahead of the 2017 Bonn COP23 on scientific developments in the understanding and prediction of climate change since the 2014 IPCC 5th Assessment Report **\[5.7\]**. 

  

 The team’s research into extreme events and climate sensitivity has further contributed to international reports \(eg Figure 10.11 in the 5<sup>th</sup> IPCC Report **\[5.2\]** is adapted from **\[3.3\]**. Professor Hegerl chaired the scientific review group for the UK Met Office Hadley Centre 2014\-2017 \(review group member from 2008\) **\[5.1\]**, and was a review group member for the recently released UK climate predictions 2018 \(UKCP18\) **\[5.8\]** which provide quantitative climate change predictions for UK policymakers and stakeholders informing major decisions on climate change adaptation e.g. managing flood risk and rising sea levels.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Dental Health Services Research Unit at Dundee has led three large\-scale randomised controlled trials addressing areas of global and national priority in clinical dentistry. The research has provided an evidence\-base for dental policy in Scotland and across the UK, with key partnerships enabling the implementation of evidence directly into clinical practice. National and international collaborations have provided evidence enabling safe dental care and increased patient access during the COVID\-19 pandemic. Impacts include: 

-  sustained yearly reductions in dental antibiotic prescribing influencing global action on antimicrobial resistance 

-  generating new clinical trial and systematic review evidence contributing to national clinical guidelines 

-  informing strategic government planning for NHS dental services for dental recall and preventive periodontal treatment 

-  increasing safe patient access to dental care during the pandemic. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Global priority: antibiotic prescribing 

 Antibiotic resistance is recognised by WHO as “one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development” and the reduction of dental antibiotic prescribing is a key health priority for governments seeking to address this threat.  The Dental Health Services Research Unit at Dundee, in partnership with NHS Education for Scotland \(NES\), delivers Scotland’s national clinical guidance through the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme \(SDCEP **Director Clarkson**\), which includes an embedded Scottish Government funded guidance implementation initiative: Translation Research in a Dental Setting \(TRiaDS\) also led by **Clarkson**. 

 Between 2007\-2011 TRiaDS monitoring of routine prescribing data demonstrated that, despite SDCEP’s antibiotic prescribing guidance, antibiotic prescriptions increased by 55,000 \(16%\).  In response to these findings, the Scottish Government commissioned TRiaDS in 2012 to conduct a randomised control trial \(RAPiD\) involving all 2,700 dentists in Scotland, to evaluate the impact of audit and feedback \(A&F\) using linked routinely collected dental prescribing and treatment data **\[R1\]**. Following the conclusion of RAPiD in 2014, a 6% reduction in national prescribing rates was observed.  Several strategies of delivering A&F were tested, including a persuasive message developed by TRiaDS, using behaviour change theory which had the greatest impact **\[R1\]**. Findings from RAPiD’s process evaluation identified a number of intervention functions and intervention policy categories to further improve dentists’ antibiotic prescribing **\[R2\]**. 

 Evidence base to inform national strategies in dental healthcare 

 The provision of cost effective, safe, person\-centred preventative healthcare is a primary objective of the UK Government. However, routine dental care lacks an evidence base to justify clinical strategy or funding. Six\-monthly check\-ups with a scale and polish \(S&P\) has been established practice for many since the start of the NHS and currently more than half the courses of dental care include a S&P.  In Scotland alone the annual cost of check\-ups and S&P’s is £62million yet prior to this research there was insufficient evidence to inform policy makers, clinicians or patients. 

 INTERVAL and IQuaD were UK\-wide, Dundee\-led randomised control trials \(RCTs\) that directly addressed this gap in evidence.  The UK\-wide collaboration included 10 of the 13 UK dental schools and was supported by all four UK Chief Dental Officers \(CDOs\). The INTERVAL trial **\[R3\]** \(2010\-2018 £3.5M\), conducted in 50 UK dental practices with 2,372 patients, found that a 24\-month recall interval was not detrimental for patients at low risk of oral disease, and results supported a person\-centred, variable risk\-based recall interval. The IQuaD trial **\[R4\]** \(2012–2017 £2.4M\), conducted in 63 dental practices across the UK with 1,877 adult patients, employed a split\-plot design combining cluster\- and patient\-level randomisation.  The results found no clinical benefit of offering a S&P at six or 12\-months compared with no S&P for regular attenders over a period of three years, nor was any clinical benefit of personalised over usual oral health advice identified. 

 International COVID\-19 response: rapid review informs safety in dental practice 

 The worldwide impact of COVID\-19 on dental services has been immense, reducing patient access and restricting care to extractions, in order to avoid aerosol generating procedures \(AGPs\) such as drill or ultrasonic\-scaler.  In order to reduce professional uncertainties around safe dental practice, and to mitigate against the risk of SARS\-co\-v2 transmission, Dundee designed and led a collaboration of researchers and guidance developers in a rapid review **\[R5\]**. 

 With international support from the World Health Organisation, FDI World Dental Federation and Chief Dental Officers from Europe, America, Canada and New Zealand, a review of the 63 international guidelines for the reopening of dental services was conducted. The review highlighted considerable variation across countries and a lack of evidence for recommendations: for instance, preprocedural\-mouthwash was recommended by 82% of national guidelines. However, the Cochrane review found no evidence for the use of preprocedural\-mouthwash **\[R6\]**. 

 UK national guidance of 60 minutes fallow time \(leaving the surgery empty\) following an AGP was in contrast to most guidelines and had resulted in severely restricted patient access. In response to the profession’s concerns of a 60\-minute fallow time, SDCEP established a UK\-wide working group to rapidly review the evidence for AGP mitigation and published within 13 weeks. The review of contamination from AGP’s suggested a potential risk of SARS\-co\-v2 transmission but no direct evidence to inform fallow time **\[R7\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Reducing Dental Antibiotic Prescribing 

 Prior to the RAPiD trial, antibiotic prescribing in dentistry was increasing year\-on\-year, accounting for 10% of all antibiotics dispensed in the UK.  It was estimated that 50% of dental antibiotic prescriptions were unnecessary, therefore negatively impacting on patient safety, effectiveness of treatment and contributing to the global threat of antimicrobial resistant \(AMR\) infections. 

 The RAPiD A&F intervention \(2013\-14\) was delivered to two\-thirds \(1,999\) of dentists in Scotland and resulted in a 6% reduction in Scotland’s national prescribing rates, equivalent to 20,000 antibiotic items over 12 months, demonstrating higher compliance with national guidelines avoiding overuse of antibiotics. Amongst the highest prescribers in the A&F intervention groups there was a 12% reduction.  RAPiD directly changed SDCEP 2016 Drug Prescribing Guidance and prompted two further national antibiotic prescribing audits by NES, completed by over 50% of all dentists **\[E1\]**. RAPiD directly reversed dental antibiotic prescribing behaviour, stimulating and contributing to the 24% reduction in antibiotics prescribed since 2013; generating a benefit to the economy by saving Scotland’s NHS circa £850k **\[E2\]**. 

 Evidence from RAPiD has also led directly to additional national antibiotic stewardship strategies. The Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group implemented a similar approach for General Medical Practitioners to reduce antibiotic prescribing, with plans to include dentists in future national quality improvement interventions **\[E2\]**. RAPiD’s process evaluation led directly to the introduction of national in\-practice training to improve the quality and safety of dental antibiotic prescribing **\[E1\]**.  As a result of this all of Scotland’s dental practices are now required to undertake this training, which includes RAPiD style A&F, at least once every three years as part of NHS practice inspection requirements.  According to the Postgraduate Dental Dean of NES: *The work of the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme has been pivotal in promoting a change in behaviour with subsequent reduction in antimicrobial prescribing.* **\[E1\]** 

 RAPiD has demonstrated that high quality research can be embedded in service delivery.  Consequently, the impact of in\-practice training is being evaluated in a national RCT to further inform national provision of education for the NHS \(evaluation delayed by COVID\-19, due to recommence in March 2021\) **\[E1, E3\]**. RAPiD has been cited as an exemplar of research partnerships between practitioners and academia and has resulted in TRiaDS being named an A&F laboratory that has had impact on research culture in healthcare systems by the International Audit and Feedback Metalab **\[E4\]**. 

 **National Priority \- Enabling evidence\-based policy** 

 The IQuaD and INTERVAL trials have generated much needed evidence for policy makers about the clinical\- and cost\-effectiveness of risk\-based recall and S&P. The Chief Dental Officer for Scotland notes the “ *significant contribution in terms of evidence and guidance”* **\[E5\]** made by the Dundee team to the development of The Scottish Government’s 2018 Oral Health Improvement Plan, noting that: 

 *the evidence they have generated from UK national trials in dental primary care has informed government thinking* *which underpins the design of our preventive approach.*” **\[E5\]**. 

 and commenting further on the value of the evidence in relation to informing models of preventive care that will form the basis of future oral health strategies: 

 *The INTERVAL and IQuaD trials led by Dundee have provided my office with evidence to inform the design, development and cost effectiveness of the future preventive model of care* **\[E5\]**. 

 IQuaD has also been cited as the underpinning evidence for government policy in relation to changing the service provision and payment of S&P **\[E6\]**, although dental policy development in the UK has been delayed due to the pandemic. 

 In a departure from normal process, the relevant Cochrane reviews were updated during the publication of IQuaD and INTERVAL **\[E7\]**, minimising the delay between evidence generation, synthesis and adoption by practice. The findings were reported widely in the national and international news media and provided reassurance to the public that intervals between dental check\-ups can be extended beyond six months without detriment to their oral health. This was particularly important given the impact of COVID\-19 on the provision of dental care worldwide. Public Health England’s ‘Delivering Better Oral Health Toolkit’, to which all 26,000 NHS dentists in England and Wales are expected to comply, is being updated and has adopted the robust methods of SDCEP in order to improve quality. The INTERVAL and IQuaD findings in relation to risk\-based recall and S&P were included through the related Cochrane reviews **\[E8\]**. 

 COVID\-19 informing safe practice and widening patient access 

 The Dundee\-led partnership response to COVID\-19 has resulted in evidence\-based guidance and resources that have supported the re\-opening and mobilisation of dental services internationally **\[E9\]**, **\[E10\]**. The SDCEP resources were downloaded over 320,000 times in the three months from March 2020, and the rapid reviews of international dental guidelines were distributed by WHO Director for Oral Health to global stakeholders, including the worldwide network of CDOs. 

 The SDCEP AGP Mitigation Rapid Review conclusions i\) not to recommend preprocedural mouthwash and ii\) that fallow time could safely be reduced to a minimum of 10 minutes, informed the Chief Medical Officers independent committee on AGP’s and was supported by all 4 of the UK’s Chief Dental Officers. Within 4 weeks of publication \(25\-09\-20\) the UK Infection Prevention Control guidance, published by Public Health England, changed its recommendation to take account of the SDCEP AGP Review **\[E11\]**. The British Dental Association estimates that the reduction in fallow time, from 60 minutes to 10 minutes, could increase access to UK dental care from 20% to between 60\-70% **\[E12\]**. According to Public Health England: 

 *The programme of research undertaken at SDCEP and led by Professor Clarkson has had far reaching impact for both dental policy and service delivery both nationally and internationally.* **\[E8\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Schaffner’s research has challenged the widely shared view that feelings of burnout and fatigue are a distinctly modern phenomenon, specific to an age dominated by various communication and other technologies. Demonstrating that the experience of extreme fatigue recurs throughout history, her work has informed the representation and discussion of exhaustion in the national and international media. The significance of her impact – as underscored by worldwide feedback from readers and listeners, journalists and writers – lies in a significantly increased public awareness that exhaustion is constitutive of humanity in general, rather than being a mere epiphenomenon of modernity. This key insight has been disseminated via innumerable articles, interviews, and documentaries, reaching an audience of millions across the globe. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In 2013, Schaffner noticed a sharp rise in media reports on stress and burnout in the UK and Germany. While the emphasis in the UK was more squarely on stress as a problem to be addressed by individual resilience, in Germany the media preferred to talk about burnout as a broader socio\-political problem. The news reports had one thing in common, though: our own age, nearly all commentators claimed, was the most exhausting in history. This prompted Schaffner to begin researching the history of exhaustion. Counter to its media representation as a modern phenomenon, Schaffner soon found that writers throughout history and across cultures have reflected on exhaustion: its symptoms and causes are present, for example, in theories of melancholia in classical antiquity, in treatises on acedia in the medieval period and on neurasthenia in the nineteenth century, as well as in the literature on depression, stress, burnout, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in the twentieth and twenty\-first centuries. In each period, the causes and effects of exhaustion were theorised in radically different ways. 

 Following a widely read blog for the Centre for Medical Humanities at the University of Durham \(May 2013\), Schaffner published a journal article on ‘Exhaustion and the Pathologization of Modernity’ **\[R1\]**. She also shared her thesis about the longer history of exhaustion in the essay 'German Burnout’ \( *Times Literary Supplement*, February 2014\), which reached over 30,000 readers \(online and print\). More important for the underpinning research, however, was her securing of Wellcome Trust funding for a conference on the topic \(October 2013\). At this conference, Schaffner became acquainted with Greta Wagner and Sighard Neckel, with both of whom she later collaborated in co\-editing the interdisciplinary essay collection *Burnout, Fatigue, Exhaustion: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on a Modern Affliction* **\[R4, R6\]**. In the wake of the conference, Schaffner was invited to be an associate researcher at the Wellcome Trust Hubbub Rest project, to take part in a public panel discussion on ‘Exhaustion Then and Now’ with Sir Simon Wessely \(chaired by BBC presenter Claudia Hammond, June 2015\), and to deliver numerous public lectures on the topic. 

 The publication in 2016 of Schaffner's monograph *Exhaustion: A History* **\[R2\]** encouraged further public engagement with her work. Its key finding – that exhaustion has been present as an experience that has been reflected on, in varying forms, throughout history and across cultures – was received as ‘an impressive and important contribution to the growing field of medical humanities’ \( *British Society for Literature and Science*, February 2018\), deemed ‘a compelling and thought\-provoking read for doctors’ \( *History of Medicine*, December 2016\), and considered ‘attractive \- and accessible \- to a wider readership' \( *British Medical Journal*, August 2016\). 

 The publication of *Exhaustion: A History* generated wide public interest, and was followed by numerous radio interviews, as well as blogs and newspaper, magazine, and journal articles that would generate considerable impact, changing the media representation of exhaustion across the world and altering its public understanding. In addition, her research into the history of exhaustion led Schaffner to write her well\-received novel *The Truth about Julia* **\[R3\]**, in which she presents a creative engagement with the idea of political exhaustion.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Schaffner’s research has intervened decisively in the public discourse on tiredness, fatigue, and exhaustion, offering an alternative perspective to the notion that ours is the most exhausting age in history. Journalists and commentators worldwide have seen her work as transforming the public understanding of exhaustion; by drawing productive comparisons to historic experiences of tiredness, they suggest, it mitigates some of the negative consequences of the widespread media and public focus on contemporary exhaustion. As journalist Maggie Puniewska puts it, what is ‘comforting to the fried, 21st\-century worker is that regardless of the epoch, regardless of whether humans were living in agrarian societies or were bystanders to a world that was modernizing at an unprecedented velocity, people were tired’ **\[a\]**. 

 Schaffner’s most significant impact on public understanding was via the BBC Radio 4 documentary *Exhaustion: A History* \(November 2019\). This programme was based almost entirely on her book, as evidenced not only by the title but also by the presenter Phillip Ball’s tweet that ‘it is really Anna’s fantastic work that created it’ **\[j\]**. The documentary follows exactly the structure of Schaffner’s study: from Greek antiquity, via the spiritual failings of the desert\-dwelling monks of early Christianity, the celestial bodies of Renaissance thinking, and the moralistic sexual messages of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to the modern obsessions with nerves, neurasthenia, and burnout. Just like her book, *Exhaustion: A History* **\[R2\]**, the Radio 4 documentary ends with Schaffner’s thesis that fears of exhaustion are actually fears about mortality. As well as being selected for the ‘BBC's Seriously podcast' \(and thus made available internationally\), the programme was selected as both BBC Radio 4’s and the *Observer’s* ‘Pick of the week’. Twitter feedback was also very strong, with personal development coach Lynette Goodcare recommending it to anyone interested in ‘developing \[their\] understanding of the concept of fatigue/exhaustion’ **\[j\]**. 

 Beyond the UK, Schaffner's work has influenced discussion of exhaustion on a global scale. Following the publication of her book **\[R2\]**, she has been interviewed by journals, magazines, and newspapers across the world, including *BBC Future* \(July 2016, translated into various languages\), *New Scientist* \(October 2016\), *National Geographic* \(August 2016\), *Psychology Today* \(June 2016\), *Metro* \(July 2016\), *The Irish Times* \(September 2017\), *The Week* \(August 2016\), *Knack Belgium* \(October 2016\), *New Zealand Listener* \(December 2016\), *Die Welt am Sonntag* \(December 2016\), *Le Matin Dimanche* \(December 2016\), *Philosophie Magazine* \(December 2019\), and *Kurier* \(July 2020\). In addition, Schaffner has spoken about her work on six major radio shows in the UK, the US, Canada, and Ireland, including Radio 4’s *Thinking Allowed* \(July 2017\), the award\-winning American investigative journalism show *On Point* \(August 2016\), CBC’s *The Current* \(September 2016\), and Wisconsin Public Radio’s *To the Best of Our Knowledge* \(November 2017\). She was also interviewed for ‘The Art of Manliness’ podcast series \(January 2019\) and for the Dutch Newspaper *De Volkskrant* \(January 2019\). 

 The titles given to these many podcasts, reviews, and interviews – including ‘Is Exhaustion a Modern Phenomenon?’ **\[b\]**, ‘Are Modern People the Most Exhausted in History?’ **\[b\],** ‘Feeling Exhausted? Historically, You're Not Alone’ **\[b\]**, ‘Now We're Stressed Out? History Shows It's the Oldest Emotion’ **\[c\]**, ‘Burnt Out? Relax, We've Been Exhausted for Centuries’ **\[d\]**, and ‘Tired All the Time? Join the World's Oldest Club’ **\[d\]** – demonstrate a step change in the media portrayal of our age as the most exhausting in history. As Thomas Dixon wrote in the *Times Literary Supplement*, for instance, ‘the long\-term approach allows Schaffner to show that theories of exhaustion have, for centuries, been linked to nostalgic narratives about an earlier, slower, more natural, less technological and less exhausted form of life. \[…\] Schaffner’s ambitious work \[…\] lets us engage in imaginative emotional time\-travel of a kind that acknowledges a shared humanity as well as cultural difference’ \( *TLS*, June 2016 **\[f\]**\). 

 The Director of the Klassik Weimar Stiftung has stated that Schaffner’s work ‘shines a new light on the contribution of literary history and criticism to medical and socio\-political issues such as fatigue, burnout, and resilience’ **\[h\]**, a view shared by sociologist Sighard Neckel, for whom ‘what is most striking is that Professor Schaffner appears to have changed the perspective from which journalists think about exhaustion and subsequently reported and wrote about the topic. As a result of her work, media debates on exhaustion took a different form, referring to a much broader historical perspective’ **\[i\]**. BBC journalist David Robson echoes this diagnosis, stating that ‘Schaffner’s book, and the subsequent interview, challenged my assumption that exhaustion is a modern phenomenon, and demonstrated how many people, throughout history, have suffered from fatigue \[…\]. Since the interview I have written about exhaustion and other related conditions \(such as stress, insomnia and loneliness\) with more historical awareness – for the BBC, *New Scientist* and the *i*. \[…\]. Anna’s research, but more generally, her approach has inspired me to think more carefully about the role of culture in our medical understanding of disease’ **\[e\]**. 

 Further international voices reinforce the impact that Schaffner’s work has had in changing the public perception of exhaustion. In ‘Burnout – Warum viele Menschen so erschöpft sind’ \( *NEWS*, 2017\), Carina Pachner states that: ‘Burnout is a real problem of our age, but not only of ours’ **\[a\]**, while Marcel Lepper, writing in the *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung*, notes that ‘Schaffner has lately shown that diagnoses relating to exhaustion are not a modern phenomenon’ **\[h\]**. 

 Jenny Stallard summarises the impact of Schaffner’s work when she suggests that ‘it’s time to accept we’re not the only generation to feel exhausted’ \( *Metro*, 21 July 2016\) **\[g\]**, even if our generation’s challenge now takes the unprecedented form as a result of the Covid\-19 pandemic, as a recent interview with Schaffner in the Austrian newspaper *Kurier* suggests **\[g\]**. Through these many interviews and articles – which have reached an audience reach of over 6 million people worldwide **\[j\]** – Schaffner's work has shown that exhaustion, far from being a mere millennial fashion, is in fact an ever\-present historical phenomenon.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Orchards were for centuries an important part of the landscape, but their numbers have declined drastically since the 1950s. Our project has worked both to arrest this decline and to increase public awareness of orchards as a natural heritage resource making a vital contribution to biodiversity. Having traced their history, we recruited 750 volunteers to undertake citizen science. In some cases, the volunteers were trained in mapping, surveying, and archival research, in others in pruning, grafting, and other traditional skills. With their help, we supervised the planting of 55 orchards of more than 1000 new trees, the compilation of a comprehensive biodiversity survey, the DNA sequencing of fruit types, and the first proper assessment of the benefits that orchard habitats confer. Volunteers \(including schoolchildren\) were taught the importance of orchards, the skills required to maintain them, and the dietary benefits of eating fruit. A programme of more than 50 training or other workshops, including apple identification days, schools\-outreach, public lectures, a cookbook, and culinary\-skills sessions, spread knowledge of orchard management and the message that traditional varieties can be used to produce healthy meals. In the process, important scientific information was gathered and disseminated. The environment and natural heritage were protected. All of this with attendant benefits for ecology, biodiversity, social cohesion, public understanding, physical and mental well\-being, and the protection of endangered species nationally and internationally.

 2. Underpinning Research 

 Williamson heads the Landscape Group in UEA’s School of History and is internationally renowned for his research on agricultural history, medieval field systems, and designed landscapes \(parks and gardens\). He is also famed for his ability to build and work with teams. His interest in orchards, first signalled in 2012, grew out of these broad intellectual concerns. Williamson’s interest in trees is longstanding. From 2003, working with Gerry Barnes MBE \(formerly Norfolk County Council Chief Environmental Officer and Chair of the Forestry Commission Regional Advisory Board\), he researched what became their revisionist 2015 monograph *Rethinking Ancient Woodland* \( **3.1**\). In 2014, in the wake of mounting public concern about ash dieback, Williamson was funded by the AHRC and DEFRA \(Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\) to investigate the history of tree management and disease \( **3.7**\). The project employed two Research Assistants \(Barnes and Toby Pillatt\) and produced a comprehensive report for DEFRA \( **3.2**\). The results of this research were published in articles and in the widely acclaimed *Trees in England* \( **3.3**\), which received the 2018 Woodlands Award ‘Book of the Year’ award and was described in the *Economic History Review* \(2019\) as *‘likely to remain one of the keystones in understanding the English landscape’*. In tandem with this interest in trees and woodland, and foundational to his project to publicise and reverse the decline in orchards, Williamson’s work extended to a more general consideration of the character of the ‘natural’ in long\-settled regions, as explored in his *An Environmental History of Wildlife in England* \(2013\) and in articles jointly written with leading ecologists \(most notably, Fuller *et al.*, **3.4**\). This, and the relative biodiversity benefits delivered by landscape features such as orchards managed on ‘traditional’ lines, as opposed to ‘re\-wilding’ – a key ongoing debate in environmental policy – were the subjects of his 2017 Colin Matthew Lecture for the Royal Historical Society \( **3.5**\). 

 Orchards are collections of old and often rare varieties of fruit tree. Until Williamson’s work, they had received little or no serious attention from historians. The trees themselves take 15 years or more to reach maturity, veteranize after 50 years or so, and can continue to live for upwards of 120 years. They supply important habitats, especially for certain key invertebrates, yet were always intensively managed and highly artificial in character.  Since the early Middle Ages, they have had a vital economic role besides carrying a range of symbolic meanings and forming important elements of historic landscape design. Working with Barnes, Williamson obtained funding from Norfolk County Council to employ Landscape Group researcher Patsy Dallas to undertake a systematic programme of research into the history of orchards in Norfolk. This led to a report for the Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership and Norfolk County Council and to an article published in the journal *Landscapes* \(Dallas *et al.,* **3.6**\) which discussed the hundreds of species of fruit grown before 1900, their geographical distribution, and the design ideas of local gardeners. 

 The article came to the attention of orchard enthusiasts, delighted at last to discover a degree of common ground with academic specialists. This led to Williamson’s proposal for a substantial project, based at UEA, working with a range of partners to study and enhance the orchard heritage of the six modern counties of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk. Financial support was obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and the project, ‘Orchards East’, was launched in 2017 \( **3.8**\), supervised by Williamson and Rowena Burgess \(a social historian attached to UEA’s Landscape Group\), and employing a Project Officer \(Howard Jones\) and a part\-time Volunteer Co\-ordinator \(Genevieve Broad\). 

 Our initial aims were: \(1\) To survey and disseminate understanding of the region’s orchard heritage and ecology, and \(2\) To enhance the orchard heritage, by planting new community orchards \(using traditional, vigorous rootstocks\); by providing training courses in orchard skills, including pruning and grafting; by educating the public in the importance of orchards; and by encouraging the cultivation of traditional and often endangered varieties through workshops showing how these can be used to provide healthy meals. 

 The two aspects of the project were intimately related. For example, our research, initiated before but enhanced through the project, informed the choice of trees planted \(mostly apples, but with some pears, plums and heritage fruit such as medlars\), the kinds of rootstock to be used, and the ways in which these new orchards are to be managed into the future. As a result of the COVID\-19 pandemic, the original project funding, for three years, was extended by the Heritage Lottery Fund, amidst major disruption to our timetable but without seriously impairing the achievement of our principal goals.

 4. Details of the Impact 

 Through its combination of academic research, ‘citizen science’, educational activities, and planting programmes, Orchards East has had multiple and far\-reaching impacts, sustainable for decades to come. With partners including the National Trust, the People’s Trust for Endangered Species, and several wildlife trusts \( **5.9**\) **,** we brought together the too often dislocated needs and ambitions of professional historians, scientists, cultivators, officials and public bodies, ecologists, local businesses, and the wider community. The outcome was a truly interdisciplinary venture, permanently enhancing both natural and cultural heritage, beautifying the locations in which we worked, protecting and, so far as possible, arresting decline of an endangered environment, and spreading best practice and historical understanding to the widest possible constituency. 

 **Planting:** With volunteers and partners, we planted 55 new orchards, each designed \(following our research\) to feature varieties associated with the localities in question \(see list on file **5.9**\). These are grafted onto the kinds of vigorous and long\-lived rootstocks which we now know serve to maximise biodiversity. All told, 735 new trees were planted directly by the project and our volunteers, with at least a further 300 planted in partnership with 26 local organisations. Each new orchard has been provided with an authoritative, but accessible, information board, combining historical, scientific, and local community knowledge. Sixteen of the orchards were in the grounds of schools and 25 were new community ventures, situated in both urban and rural locations \(including two in Luton\). A further three were showcase collections, presenting a full range of local varieties, including that at Stowmarket Museum of East Anglian Life intended as a complete ‘East Anglian collection’ \(50 trees\). There \(according to the Museum Director\), the project *‘turned semi\-derelict ground into something of which we are extremely proud … educat\(ing\) the community about the connections between food production, heritage and health for many years to come’*, all of this as *‘a major first step’* on their road to becoming a Food Museum \( **5.1**\). 

 The remainder were planted at institutions or for community organisations, including, with the active participation of inmates, five prisons \(HMP Wayland, HMP Highpoint, HMP Warren Hill, HMP Hollesley Bay, HMP Whitemoor\). The groups and communities involved have been universally appreciative. At Chatteris, for instance, *‘the number of people visiting … has been beyond our dreams and we have had praise and thanks on social media for providing such a welcome addition to the open space in the town’*, especially during the long and difficult months of COVID\-19 lockdown \( **5.2a**\). At Middleton, children of the local nursery school now tend the trees as *‘a focal point to the village’* \( **5.2b**\), and at Ipswich \( **5.2c**\) the orchard is considered *‘absolutely wonderful’*. At Swavesey, 100 residents gathered to plant 40 new trees and have since gone on to form their own association to tend the orchard for the future and to care for the 44 species of plant so far identified within it \( **5.2d**\). At Langford, not only is the new orchard seen as an important link to the village’s past but as a resource fostering both social cohesion and natural beauty \( **5.2e**\). At Harpenden, ‘ *nearly all*’ of the 60 children who planted the trees described this as *‘the most interesting thing’* they had done in science that year, with the new trees now *‘a little symbol of hope for the community during this difficult time’* \( **5.2f**\). At Luton, amidst one of the most deprived communities in eastern England, the 20 new trees *‘have been a major contributing factor’* in establishing a local conservation group \( **5.2g**\). 

 **Skills Training: Pruning, Grafting, and Cooking:** A total of 45 fully booked orchard management workshops/training sessions were held, mainly attended by members of the public but with some targeted specifically at professional arborists \(‘training the trainers’\) and staff from the National Trust, county wildlife trusts, and similar bodies. These served to disseminate what our research has revealed as the practices shaping ‘traditional’ orchards and maximising their importance as habitats. The various sessions were attended by a total of 599 people, ranging in age from 16 to 83. Volunteers, working together with nine professional arborists and 28 orchard experts, were trained in pruning, grafting, and other traditional skills required for the long\-term sustainability of the project’s plantings. Benefits here include continued knowledge transfer through the establishment of new community associations. As reported by the Lead Advisor of Natural England \( **5.3**\), the training sessions were particularly productive both for beginners and professionals, with the project’s initiative overall of *‘major and lasting impact’*. The character of Orchard East’s input is neatly summarised by the Director of the Museum of East Anglian Life: *‘The support helped us on so many different levels … with the expertise to be able to choose what to plant, how to plant it and how to protect it. The project team also helped us produce interpretation for visitors’* \( **5.1**\). 

 Ten workshops, run by food historian Monica Askey, were organised to demonstrate how fruit in general – and traditional varieties in particular – can be used to create cheap and nutritious meals with a low carbon footprint. These were targeted at organisations dealing with the disadvantaged and marginalised, including the Grow Organisation in Norwich, a social enterprise offering interaction and support to Forces veterans and people recovering from mental illness; Darwin Nurseries, Cambridge, a centre for adults with learning difficulties and mental health challenges; St Elizabeth’s Centre for young epileptics, Much Hadham, Hertfordshire; and The Feed, Norwich, a social hub and café providing services and support for people who face barriers to employment. Wider dissemination of the key concept – that culinary practises, health, orchard conservation and heritage are inextricably linked – was achieved through the publication of a 100\-page book by Askey and Williamson, *Orchard Recipes from Eastern England: Landscape, Fruit and Heritage* \(Lowestoft 2020\), described by the British Association of Local History reviewer as *‘engagingly written and beautifully illustrated’* \( **5.10**\). The project also prepared lesson plans and other educational resources, available for download from the project website, now shared internationally via the Countryside Classroom platform  [countrysideclassroom.org.uk](https://www.countrysideclassroom.org.uk/), connecting schools and teachers around the English\-speaking world with food, farming, and the natural environment. 

 **Surveys and Conservation:** Supported by professional arborists and orchard managers, just over 150 volunteer surveyors \(equipped with maps prepared by the county Biological Records Centres\) examined 10,134 orchard sites in the eastern counties, recording what kinds of land use have replaced those which have been destroyed and the principal features of those that remain. The results have been digitised and, together with our biodiversity reports, form the basis of our ‘State of the Orchards’ survey for submission to County Councils and conservation bodies \(together with the digitised data in GIS format\) for use as a conservation management tool by County Biodiversity Centres. The overall results make uncomfortable reading.  Nearly 90 per cent of the orchards present in 1960 have been grubbed up.  A key finding here was that orchards were already in significant decline long before the UK’s 1973 accession to the European Economic Community: a point of no little political significance, given the rhetoric deployed by those inclined to blame ‘Europe’ for such decline. 

 Sample orchards were subject to detailed biodiversity surveys, mainly carried out by professional consultants, with some volunteer participation.  These have revealed the critical importance of orchard habitat for a range of species but, above all, for saproxylic invertebrates, bryophytes, and lichens. The survey results, according to Norfolk County Council’s Biodiversity Officer \( **5.4**\), have *‘transformed our understanding of orchard heritage’,* mapping and recording *‘a habitat of principal importance under section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act \(2006\)’*, likely to prove crucial to all future *‘evidence\-based planning and wildlife conservation decisions’;* with additional *‘untold social and community benefits’*. The scientific benefits extend beyond local to truly international significance. As reported by the Orchards Biodiversity Officer of the People’s Trust for Endangered Species, this *‘the most comprehensive investigation of traditional orchards yet to be undertaken … will feed into many other projects across the UK and Europe … significantly improv\(ing\) our ability to conserve and preserve \(wildlife\) habitat in the future’* \( **5.5**\). Orchards East has also been credited with *‘Rais\[ing\] the profile of orchards as biodervsity habitats’* and *‘galvanis\(ing\) local interest’* \( **5.6**\) in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. By channelling funds into the DNA finger\-printing of ancient fruit varieties, according a leading specialist in this field \(and developer of the  [FruitID website](https://www.fruitid.com/), whose work was directly supported by the project, **5.7**\), Williamson’s work has been instrumental in improving DNA genotyping, enhancing a resource now used worldwide, and, via the Institut National de la recherche agronomique \(the principal French ecological research institute\), enabling such findings to be shared across 19 European countries. 

 **Legacy:** Progress on the project was adversely affected by COVID\-19 but our substantial monograph on the history and ecology of orchards in eastern England is now in press. Meanwhile, our ‘State of the Orchards’ report and associated digital datasets will, for many years, provide a valuable conservation tool for a wide range of partners, conservationists, and relevant government agencies. A newly designed website,  [Orchards East\- https://orchardseast.theportman.co/](https://orchardseast.theportman.co/) supports a ‘legacy body’, Orchards East Forum, established with partners to sustain the project’s activities into the future. It also hosts ‘Advice Notes’, educational material for schools, and a range of other information, replacing the project’s original website. The project will thus continue to provide a platform for knowledge transfer, contributing to social cohesion, improved public health and wellbeing. Our academic research will thus continue to equip communities with the skills and enthusiasm required to resist the decline of a resource of enormous natural and cultural significance, largely neglected until now. As reported by the Senior Ecology Officer of Hertfordshire County Council, our project has *‘brought together a powerful, new appreciation of orchards, their role in society and their potential value into the future’*, its *‘academic rigour’* allowing *‘a justified, expert, and powerful expression of our understanding of orchards … Its work and that of its legacy body will continue to be of considerable importance in helping to justify, support, inform and encourage orchard protection and management’* \( **5.8**\). 

 Our 1000 trees should still be flowering and bearing fruit into the next century. Meanwhile, a project emerging from landscape history has evolved into an interdisciplinary venture in citizen science, involving a wide range of stakeholders, young and old, prosperous and disadvantaged. Our planting and cultivation of green spaces now reaches out to influence the future of ecology and heritage not only nationally but beyond.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prof. Ravi Deepres’ multi\-disciplinary research has revolutionised contemporary dance practice, by inserting cutting\-edge digital technologies into the choreographic process to create novel works for stage, screen and exhibition. Through his long\-term collaboration with the internationally renowned contemporary dance company Studio Wayne McGregor \(SWM\), Deepres’ research has expanded the company’s understanding of contemporary choreography and prompted innovation in its practice. His research is central to acclaimed modern dance works, such as SWM’s Olivier Award winning Woolf Works, and Atomos, which at the time of writing have reached a combined audience of 778,904. The long\-lasting influence of Deepres’ research is apparent in his collaborators’ confidence to explore new technologies in other creative projects, such as Google’s online Living Archive of Dancers with SWM, new commissions by the National Gallery and National Ballet of Canada, and the creation of a new commissioning opportunity that benefitted an emerging artist. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Deepres’ research uses innovative adaptation and implementation of cutting\-edge visual and digital technology to create unique artistic representations of the human body in movement. In doing so, it reframes choreography as a multi\-disciplinary collaborative practice. The outputs of the three projects included in this submission are a gallery exhibition, two theatre productions with SWM, with whom Deepres has collaborated since the year 2000, and a film for the BBC. These form a body of work that explores two central research themes. The first tackles conceptual questions of narrative structure, temporal perception, and the role of the choreographer in contemporary dance practice. The second is concerned with advancing the use of cutting\-edge film technology as a key component of a multi\-disciplinary choreography process. 

 Deepres has collaborated with technology companies, whose solutions are normally used within the fields of architecture, surveying and the sciences. These experiments led to the development of novel techniques for applying technologies, such as LIDAR scanning \(a 3D mapmaking and surveying technique\), 3D projection and super\-slow\-motion technology to capture live images of the human body. 

 The results of these experiments have been integrated into the choreographic process, resulting in works that combine live dancers with digital and film media. In each of the three projects that contribute to this submission \(detailed below\), Deepres located his practice at a different point in the choreographic development process \(R01, R02\). 

 
<ins>Atomos \(201</ins><ins>5</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>\(R03\)</ins> was **a collaborative project with SWM.** Research was undertaken in collaboration with LCI Productions, a 3D and event projection company, to find a new way to use 3D imagery on moving screens in order to combine specially shot film footage with graphic animation. This resulted in a novel methodology that allowed human dancers to respond to virtual ones, framing film design as a component of a multi\-disciplinary choreographic practice. Atomos **was later adapted into a film, directed by Deepres, and broadcast online by the BBC. In the process of adapting the stage production to screen, Deepres, as director, was obliged to make choreographic decisions about which of the dancer’s movements would appear on screen at any given moment. This necessitated the development of techniques that reframe the relationship between 3D film technology and the role of choreography. \(R05\)** 

 
<ins>Woolf Works \(2015\)</ins>\(R04\) was a contemporary dance production made in collaboration with SWM and the Royal Ballet. Here, the research objective was to combine film and dance in a way that referenced Woolf’s experimental use of metaphor and narrative structure to reflect the contemporary social and political climate. Experimentation was undertaken that resulted in the development of a translucent gauze screen, allowing the presentation of a metaphorical scene to the audience, as an illusionary layer, which at first appears physical and then becomes transparent. 

 
<ins>Gain Line \(2015\)</ins> <ins>\(</ins>R04\) was a film installation commissioned by Rugby Art Gallery \(RAG\) to celebrate the UK’s hosting of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The research aim was to explore how the design of the rugby pitch could be adapted for use in a choreographic practice that presented players’ movements in an artistic context, reframing the history and identity of the game of rugby. Research began by analysing the ethnography of cultural and social groups involved within the game. In collaboration with producers Film & Video Umbrella \(FVU\) and laser\-scanning company APR Services, various technologies, primarily LIDAR scanning, were adapted for first\-time use in an artistic project for filming training sessions and live matches. The outcome was a 17\-minute moving image installation that used choreographic and filmic techniques to present the movement of rugby players, uniquely in an art gallery setting.

### 1.  Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Deepres’ research combines techniques of film, photography and the novel application of digital technologies. It has led to an expansion of the boundaries of contemporary choreography, a fact recognised by his nomination for the prestigious ‘Knight of Illumination’ award in 2015 \(RG01\). His research has significantly influenced the choreographic practice at one of the leading contemporary dance companies in the world, SWM, and has contributed to developing skills within the production team and to opening up new opportunities for other technological collaborations. Deepres’ innovative use of technology has also influenced new commissioning opportunities for other artists. 

 <ins>1 – Expanding the understanding and practice of contemporary choreography</ins> 

 This research has made a significant and demonstrable impact on the way that choreography is conceptualised at SWM, and consequently how it is presented to audiences internationally. During Deepres’ 20\-year collaboration with the SWM’s lighting teams, set designers and choreographers, his research has introduced novel forms of technology that have redefined the scope of choreography. SWM’s choreographer and director acknowledges that Deepres’ innovative techniques with film and photography have helped SWM to explore and create entirely new expressions of choreographic practice. He explains that Deepres’ “ *vision and ideas have allowed \[SWM\] to use still and moving images in extraordinary ground\-breaking new ways, changing the potential of choreography to happen in virtual space and not be limited to the physical body* *\[by showing\]* *both \[SWM\] and the wider dance world the potential of creating new choreographic languages through technology*.” \(S01\) 

  

 Deepres’ research shaped the novel use of technology in SWM’s Atomos \(2015\) and the critically acclaimed Woolf Works \(2015\), which won the 2015 Olivier Award for Best Dance Production. Wolf Works attracted sell\-out audiences in the Royal Opera House, UK and La Scala, Italy. Atomos has been performed in 63 venues internationally to a total audience of 69,543 \(S02\). Both productions were recorded and made into films and have been shown at cinemas in the UK, internationally and broadcast on BBC Four, to audiences of 201,011 \(Atomos\) and 492,373 \(WW\) \(S02\). 

 An integral part of Atomos was the novel application of LIDAR scanning technology that Deepres developed with APR Services. It produced visual 3D material that influenced and changed how SWM’s choreographer and director worked with the dancers on stage, serving as templates for new forms of choreographic expression. 

 The Wolf Works film was projected onto a mesh screen at the front of the stage that allowed audiences to see the dancer’s movements and the projection of super slow\-motion images simultaneously. This, when combined with a narration of Woolf’s writing, created a novel setting for the way audiences experience narrative structure. 

 SWM’s choreographer and director confirms that during the production of Wolf Works, Deepres’ research prompted a shift in his understanding, leading to a methodological change: “ *At the end of Woolf Works Act 1, the innovative use of laser scanning imagery created an almost 3\-dimensional fragmented mesh on stage, changing how \[I\] understood the spatial dynamics of the stage and hence adopted parts of the physical choreography in response.”* \(S01\).  The dynamic contribution of Deepres’ research in the final production is also confirmed in a review in *The Guardian* \(2013\), which notes that *""When the work flies, it's because the research has been absorbed into the fabric of the choreography…”* \(S03\). 

 <ins>2 – Developing skills and encouraging new explorations</ins> 

 The influence of Deepres’ research is also indirectly conveyed through his collaborative relationships, introducing partners to new multi\-disciplinary techniques and experimental approaches to technology. For example, Deepres’ research collaborations with SWM have encouraged and spawned subsequent creative arts projects that explore the boundaries of dance and technology, such as SWM’s experimental project with Google, ‘Living Archive’. This is a collaboration with Google to turn SWM’s archive of dance into an online creative tool using machine learning \(S04\). In addition, SWM’s Executive Producer \(S05\) acknowledges that it is through working with Deepres to turn Atomos from a live production to a recorded output, that gave the company the knowledge and confidence to undertake ‘Winged Bull in the Elephant Case’, a collaborative film project with Arts Council England, Battersea Arts Centre and BBC Arts that was broadcast on BBC 2 \(03/03/2018\) and exhibited in the National Gallery \(05/03 – 08/04/2018\) to a combined audience of 737,239 \(S06 & S02\). 

 Similarly, the director of RAG explained that collaborating with Deepres has had long\-lasting impact on the gallery’s confidence to explore and use digital formats. Gain Line was the first time RAG had commissioned something digitally on such a large scale, and she said of her experience of working with Deepres that it gave them: “ *the confidence as an organisation to be able to do more… so I would say in terms of the technical knowledge and confidence to go for stuff like that has increased as a result of having worked \[with Deepres\]*.”\(S07\) 

 <ins>3 \- Creating new commissioning opportunities</ins> 

 Deepres’ research has been central to the creation of new commissioning opportunities. 

 The artistic administrator of the National Ballet of Canada \(NBC\) acknowledged that: “ *Mr. Deepres’ work as film designer…specifically on Woolf Works…is a key ingredient and integral component of the commission…*” of a major new co\-production between NBC and the Royal Ballet, scheduled for 2022 \(S08\). 

 After working on Gain Line, the directors of Film & Video Umbrella \(FVU\) commissioned a new work from an emerging artist that also used LIDAR technology \(2017\). The FVU technical manager acknowledges “ *a definite connection between working with Ravi, working with that particular \[LIDAR\] technology, seeing what it could do, and then introducing that to another artist.”* \(S09\) This demonstrates how their subsequent decision to create the opportunity via the Jerwood/FVU Awards was a direct result of Deepres’ research. The artist in question observed that, as a result of this prestigious commission and the consequent raising of his artistic profile, he has been able to access further professional opportunities that otherwise would not have been open to him. He has stated that the project he is currently working on was made possible because of the *“experience of working on the FVU project”* and that the prestige attached to the FVU/Jerwood award *“made it easier to produce more higher\-end films, and get budgets that are more realistic to pull these kind of projects off.”* \(S10\) 

 The evidence \(S01\-S10\) included here speaks to the diverse and far\-reaching impact of Deepres’ innovative research. By challenging conventional understandings of choreography, via the novel application of visual technologies, he has provoked significant changes in the practice of both his immediate collaborators and of those further afield. Additionally, the impact of his work on skills development has led to new opportunities for a range of arts practitioners.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Professor Gavin Davidson has collaborated with a number of colleagues to develop a body of research on the effective facilitation of supported decision making. Davidson et al.’s research played a key role in informing the development of the Mental Capacity Act \(Northern Ireland\) 2016, a world\-leading piece of legislation which, for the first time, combined both mental health and mental capacity provisions into a single legislative act. The research also provided significant data which assisted the Northern Ireland Department of Health in developing its plans for implementation of the legislation, including workforce planning and the production of a code of practice. Finally, the research played a central role in developing the knowledge, awareness and understanding of a significant proportion of the health and social care workforce in Northern Ireland with regard to the implementation of the legislation. The beneficiaries of the Act are the estimated 120,000 people in Northern Ireland who have impaired decision\-making ability and so, ultimately, the research has contributed to a significant positive impact on this group of people. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In 2012, Davidson led a research team which carried out a comprehensive review of the international literature on the development and effectiveness of supported decision making \(Ref 1\). His colleagues, Professor Berni Kelly \(Queen’s University Belfast\) and Professor Geraldine Macdonald \(then Queen’s University Belfast\), were part of this team. Supported decision making refers to approaches to support people whose decision\-making ability is impaired to make their own decisions. This review included an analysis of the available international evidence on and approaches to supported decision making. Davidson et al. concluded that it was very difficult to ensure that supported decision making was effectively facilitated in all settings without a clear statutory requirement to this effect. This review of the evidence was the first time that international research findings had been analysed to inform the legislative framework in Northern Ireland. 

 Subsequently, in 2013 Davidson teamed up with collaborators at universities in Ireland, Australia and Canada to carry out an international comparison of legal frameworks facilitating supported decision making \(Ref 2\). This study, which was also led by Davidson, compared developments in four jurisdictions: Ontario, Canada; Victoria, Australia; England and Wales; and Northern Ireland. This comparative analysis, covering both mental health and mental capacity law, had not been completed before and provided further direction for how a new approach could work in Northern Ireland. 

 Reference 3 was co\-authored with Dr Colin Harper, an Honorary Lecturer at Queen’s and also with Professor Roy McClelland, an Emeritus Professor at Queen’s. Professor McClleland was the former Chair of the Bamford Review which had recommended this new approach. The article comprised an overview and analysis of the new Act which identified the potential effects of the Act and some of the key issues to be considered for implementation. A central aspect of the information needed for implementation was the estimated prevalence of impaired decision making in Northern Ireland across causes of impairment which included: physical health; dementia; mental health; intellectual disabilities and brain injury. 

 In 2015, Davidson was commissioned by the Law Centre NI, to complete a report \(Ref 4\) to help identify the scope of the new legal framework in Northern Ireland. The study drew on the available research on impaired decision\-making across causes and settings to develop estimates on the scale of the population likely to benefit from the legislation. The study found that an estimated 120,000 people in Northern Ireland had some level of impairment and so would come under the scope of the Act. It also concluded that those receiving inpatient treatment for their physical health and who lacked the relevant capacity were the largest single group \(61,000/120,000\). 

 In 2017\-18 Davidson also led the Queen’s contribution to an inter\-agency qualitative research project on supported decision making in Northern Ireland. This study was funded by Disability Research for Independent Living and Learning, a UK\-wide programme supported by the Big Lottery. This project used a co\-production methodology to explore people with mental health problems and/or intellectual disabilities' experiences of decision making and needs for support \(Ref 5\). Davidson and his QUB colleagues, Dr Aisling McLaughlin and Dr Lorna Montgomery, were involved in all aspects of this project. Shea Irvine contributed to the literature review and Kelly contributed to the design and participatory approach. The findings reinforced the potential benefits of supported decision making and highlighted the central importance of time in these processes. 

 The Northern Ireland Department of Health’s Offiice of Social Services also commissioned Davidson and his Queen’s University colleague, Dr Claire McCartan, to conduct further research to inform workforce planning which was completed in June 2020 \(Ref 6\). This built on previous research on the operation of the Mental Health \(Northern Ireland\) Order 1986 and work on the prevalence of impaired decision making, to enable estimates of the additional staff needed to fully implement the Act.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Informing the development of the Act** 

 The Mental Capacity Act \(Northern Ireland\) 2016 has been described by the Northern Ireland Department of Health as “… a ground\-breaking piece of legislation that, when fully commenced, will fuse together mental capacity and mental health law for those aged 16 years old and over within a single piece of legislation …” \(A\). The Head of the Department’s Mental Health and Mental Capacity Unit has described it as “…a world first fusing mental health and mental capacity legislation into one” and as “…an innovative and progressive approach which promotes the rights and autonomy of everyone in Northern Ireland whose decision making ability may be impaired.” \(B\) 

 Davidson drew on his international research on supported decision\-making to contribute to the development of this unique Act in two ways. Firstly, Davidson sat, as the professional representative for social work, on a Reference Group which was convened by the Department to inform the development of the legislation. Davidson was originally appointed to this Group in 2009, due to his relevant experience, expertise and research \(B, D\). This Group held 16 meetings up to June 2015 when the Mental Capacity Bill was tabled in the Northern Ireland Assembly \(C\). 

 A pivotal aspect of this process was when the Northern Ireland Departments of Health and Justice were considering the specific content of the draft legislation in 2014 and 2015; Davidson was one of three members of the Reference Group who were asked to attend a series of meetings with the Departments involved \(B\). The Group’s Chair, who is also Director of Law Centre NI, confirms Davidson’s contribution to the work of the Group: 

 Gavin was fully involved in all the discussions of the Reference Group and was able to draw extensively on his research, especially on legal frameworks in other jurisdictions, to inform the deliberations of the work of the Reference Group and the process. \(D\). 

 Secondly, from 2009 to 2015, Davidson was a key contributor to the Northern Ireland Mental Health and Learning Disability Alliance \(D\). This group was an alliance of health professionals, users of services and not for profit organisations which was led by Law Centre NI and which worked alongside the Reference Group to contribute ideas for progressive legislative development. His contribution to this parallel process is described thus by the Law Centre’s Director: 

 Gavin generously shared and drew on his research to inform a number of critical Chatham House Roundtables with key decision makers during the law reform process … \(D\). 

 In short, Law Centre NI’s Director believes that, through both these avenues, “Gavin’s research work and academic expertise made an important contribution to the development of this new legislative framework…” \(D\). 

 **Informing the implementation of the Act** 

 The Department’s Reference Group has also played a major role in advising on the implementation of the Act. The Head of the Department’s Mental Health and Mental Capacity Unit states: 

 As part of that \[Reference Group\] process he \[Davidson\] was able to present findings from his research about the operation of mental health law in Northern Ireland, his analysis of legal frameworks in other jurisdictions and research on supported decision making to directly inform implementation of the new Act. \(B\) 

 In particular, Davidson was appointed to a small group of relevant individuals who were commissioned by the Department of Health in April 2019 to develop key training resources to enable all health and social care staff in Northern Ireland to fully implement the Act \(B, E\). Davidson was asked to be part of this group specifically because of his research in the area of mental health and mental capacity law \(E\). He was directly involved in drafting the training resources and in training the trainers who delivered the resources. He also worked with the co\-lead, and with QUB colleagues who specialise respectively in drama and in medical education, to develop a series of video case studies and other resources to support implementation. His research on mental health and mental capacity law was “… used and referred to in the development of the training resources, and helped to provide both international and Northern Ireland evidence to support implementation.” \(E\) 

 Through its central contribution to the development of the training resources, the research has had a considerable beneficial impact on the knowledge and understanding of a substantial proportion of the health and social care workforce in Northern Ireland. Up to January 2020, just over a quarter \(15,939 \- 26%\) of all health and social care staff in Northern Ireland had taken part in the face\-to\-face version of the training programme \(F\). A robust evaluation process was put in place to monitor the impact of the face\-to face training. 81% of participants took part in an evaluation survey. Of these, nearly all \(96%\) indicated that the stated learning outcomes were met \(F\). These included the understanding of a number of key concepts including specifically to “Understand and apply the key principle of supporting individuals to make a decision” which was directly informed by the research. 91% of respondents rated the training programmes as good, very good or excellent \(F\). Moreover, the online version of the training resources had been accessed 54,000 times by January 2020 \(E\). 

 More recently, in March 2020, Davidson was commissioned by the Department of Health’s Office of Social Services to develop and deliver training on the temporary modifications to the Mental Capacity Act made by the UK Government’s Coronavirus Act 2020. This training, which has been delivered to all relevant social work staff across Northern Ireland, has drawn on Davidson’s research. \(G\) 

 The research also played a key role, in the lead\-up to the implementation of the Mental Capacity Act in 2019, in helping the Department of Health to secure the funding needed to properly implement the Act and to help plan that process \(D\). This occurred through the use that the Department made of Davidson’s research \(Ref 4\) on the prevalence of impaired decision\-making in Northern Ireland and on the the implications of implementing the Act \(D, G\). 

 As mentioned previously, Davidson was also commissioned by the Office of Social Services to undertake research estimating the number of social workers who would be needed to fully implement the Act. This research, which was completed in June 2020, was used by the Office to inform its workforce planning for the implementation of the Act \(G\). 

 **Impact of the Act outside Northern Ireland** 

 Northern Ireland’s Mental Capacity Act has attracted much attention from policymakers and relevant professionals around the world. In England, the most recent review of mental health law, in 2018, identified the impact of the Mental Capacity Act in Northern Ireland as one of the key developments to inform future reform in England. It has also been formally considered as part of current process of mental health law reform in Scotland, and Davidson was invited to provide evidence to the Scottish Review process. Internationally it is also being considered in the Australian State of Victoria, and in other jurisdictions across the world \(H\).

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Pelvic girdle dysfunction is associated with pain, instability and limitation of mobility and functioning in the pelvic joints. It is a common condition, being seen in 5% of all sporting injuries and 350,000 pregnant women in the UK. Pelvic girdle dysfunction is a difficult to manage, neuro\-musculoskeletal problem that can lead to significant associated societal and economic costs. 

 Collaborating with DM Orthotics Ltd \(UK\), we have developed, evaluated and brought to market an innovative pelvic orthotic product in the form of customised pre\-tensioned lycra support shorts. This targeted support allows optimal pain\-free movement, which has led to enhanced performance of medal winning Paralympians. The product has also improved pain control at a meaningful level, for pregnant women by on average 17%. Aligned with this, the company has expanded its product range and diversified into new areas, with increased turnover and increased market penetration into European and American markets, providing it with a competitive advantage. 
","
### 1.  Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the past 15 years, Professors Jon Marsden and Jenny Freeman have led a multi\-disciplinary research team in the School of Health Professions at the University of Plymouth, developing and evaluating an innovative pelvic orthosis to improve the management of pelvic girdle dysfunction. This pelvic orthosis, designed in the form of panelled lycra shorts, applies consistent targeted compression through strategically positioned, customised reinforced lycra panels that provide the necessary stability around the pelvic girdle to allow efficient and pain free movement. Compared to traditional rigid belts, this dynamic pelvic orthosis further provides improved aesthetics and comfort, thereby enhancing wear time and the associated benefits gained. 

 As part of a government\-funded Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with DM Orthotics Ltd, we undertook early mechanistic work to establish the effect of the direction of applied force on pelvic pain in elite athletes \(3.1\). This informed the development of a novel dynamic orthosis for pelvic girdle dysfunction in sports professionals, a condition that is particularly resistant to management leading to a dramatic impact on performance, an average 85 days’ time lost to play per club per season and, in premiership football alone, an estimated £8.8 million financial loss of income to individuals and clubs. Having developed this novel dynamic pelvic orthosis, we then evaluated it in professional rugby players and athletes, demonstrating its effectiveness \(3.2 & 3.3\) using single case study and randomised controlled study designs. 

  

 Our research subsequently expanded into the area of pelvic girdle dysfunction for pregnant women. Further laboratory\-based work investigating the mechanical properties of the fabric components informed modifications of this product for use in pregnant women at various stages of gestation. Subsequently, a European Union funded randomised controlled clinical trial evaluated this novel intervention, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly reducing pain, by a meaningful level, in pregnant women compared to established usual practice with the traditional rigid pelvic belts \(3.4\). Chronic pelvic pain following pregnancy can also impact significantly on the ability for both the father and mother to attend work, to be productive at work, and the mother’s ability to care for their growing child; as well as their own quality of life. We have subsequently demonstrated through our research that the use of this dynamic pelvic orthosis in the post\-natal period impacts positively on pain, function and quality of life \(3.5\). Further, this research, combined with an additional multi\-centre audit \(3.6\), has provided evidence of the effectiveness of orthoses for scoliosis in children with cerebral palsy. This has resulted in a more targeted treatment of this difficult to manage commonly occurring condition.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Our research benefits diverse stakeholder groups, including individual sports people and women ante\-and post\-partum with pelvic girdle dysfunction. It enhances clinical service delivery by Healthcare professionals, performance capability of sporting associations and the productivity, competitiveness and resilience of the partner SME. 

 Traditionally, orthotics have been made of rigid materials that do not accommodate movement. In recent years, the research team’s work has been at the forefront of the development and use of elastomeric \(lycra®\) fabrics, which has revolutionised the approach to these orthotics for pelvic pain management. As underlined by Martin Mathews, Chairman of DMOrthotics Ltd: *“The design of our dynamic orthoses have been directly informed by the laboratory based work undertaken at University of Plymouth, and our product line expansion has been enhanced by the demonstration of clinical effectiveness in this client group”* \[5.1\]. 

 **Impact on health, well\-being and performance** 

 Pelvic girdle dysfunction accounts for an estimated 5% of all sporting injuries. With elite athletes, pelvic girdle pain can be particularly devastating, dramatically affecting performance. 

 *Sporting performance:* 

 Our research has been highly influential in providing a state\-of\-the art product to provide stable, pain\-free movement and correct alignment, enabling improvements in motor performance and function. Evidence for improvements in athletes’ performance with this innovative orthotic is highlighted by “team DMO” \(i.e. DMOrthotics\). These athletes hail from a range of disciplines including Track and Field, Para\-cycling, Para\-archery, Para\-canoe and Boccia. The line\-up consists of World Champions and Paralympians including Kadeena Cox, Sophia Warner, Anne Dickins, Jeanette Chippington, David Smith, Jess Stretton, Patrick Wilson, Claire Taggart and Evie Edwards. These sports related orthoses have been adopted by Sport England for multiple gold medal winning Paralympians and Olympians where the smallest changes can sometimes mean the difference between being a medal winner or not. For some, the orthotics was so effective that they broke their personal best the first time they trialled this in training \[5.2\]. 

  

 Paralympian and double gold world champion sprinter Sophia Warner commented in 2014: *“I was blown away by how effective they were when I first put them on. The strength from the reinforcement panelling was so powerful. I was astounded – it felt like this was the first thing that would really work”*. Sophia’s coach Jonas Taiwah was also impressed, highlighting that *“Sophia’s main problem was that she was using muscles for stability instead of power down her left side which made her inefficient. The shorts* \(the lycra pelvic support shorts\) *changed this. This vastly increased the stability in her left leg, which in turn increased her stride length, improving her power output.”* \[5.3\]\). When Sophia first started using the orthotic, her times improved by 5.3%, which was enough to win the London Disability Athletics Challenge \[5.4\]. 

 *Pregnancy\-related pelvic pain and dysfunction* 

 Pelvic girdle dysfunction occurs in 70% of pregnant women \(350,000 women in the UK at any point in time\). Of these, 15% of women suffer severe antenatal pain, which results on average, in 7 weeks off work, an increased incidence of depression and a significant reduction in quality of life. Further, 10% of all women continue to suffer severe and chronic pain following delivery, which does not respond to a wide range of other treatments. Some endure this pain for over a decade. Such pain significantly affects everyday activities such as moving in bed, walking, carrying items, driving, and caring for their child. Women with severe pelvic girdle pain have increased health risks/costs as they have a higher request for induction of labour and elective caesarean section and safety issues related to care of the baby/toddler/child. 

 Our randomised controlled trial shows that in pregnant women, our innovative pelvic orthotic reduces pain \(as assessed by a numerical pain rating scales\) by an average of 17%. The reduction in pain is even greater post\-partum with an average reduction in pain of 54% \(range 18\-90%\) and average improvement in daily function \(as measured by the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire\) of 46% \(range 23\-62%\). This is reflected by the personal experience of women. One woman, for instance, commented that “ *I was really struggling with my day\-to\-day function as my* \(1 year old\) *son was wanting to be picked up and carried all of the time, and I was really struggling with the constant changes in position…\(*The lycra support shorts\) *really made a massive difference… it gave me the support in the areas that I needed it to, to remind me of the posture I should be in…. it helped tremendously with my sleep … I wore it virtually every day, all day, for a good year or so*” \[5.5\]. Her subjective experience is supported by objective clinical outcome measures, which demonstrated a reduction in pain of 56% and an improvement in daily function of 47%. This typifies the experience of women who have begun wearing these orthotics both during pregnancy and in the early \(<6 months\) and late \(>6 years\) post\-partum period \(6\). 

  

 **Impact on commerce and the local economy** 

 Our research has been pivotal to DMO establishing a new division to their company, DMO Sports. The expanded DMO Sport range of bespoke products, such as the patented DMO REPS™, particularly targets high\-performance athletes including Paralympians and Olympians. Chairman of the DMO Ltd \(UK\) Board Martin Matthews commented: *“The results are phenomenal and we’re extremely proud to play a part in helping such an exceptional group of athletes reach their full potential.”* \[5.1\] 

 Martin Matthews further stated that *“Refinement of the basic methods of applying corrective and compressive forces, derived from our collaborative research, directly led to the company modifying pre\-existing items such as our scoliosis suits, and expanding our product range, the audience we target and our mode of delivery” \[5.1\].* For example, at the end of 2019 the Company instigated production of stock items for both the sports and pregnancy products, enabling these to be sold at a reduced cost and in greater volume. This allowed the Company to continue to trade during the Covid\-19 pandemic, when assessments for bespoke products were not possible. The design principles taken from our research also translated into stock items for other conditions such as hypermobility syndromes. Further, in May 2020 the pelvic orthoses were developed into customised pregnancy leggings with a fashion slant aiming at the high\-end market. Overall, these research\-driven developments have helped to make the company more resilient whilst other companies no longer have a market presence in this area of dynamic orthoses. 

 In addition, these developments have provided the company with a competitive advantage, affording the opportunity to gain increased market penetration and sales, including those overseas \(Singapore, USA, Germany\) necessitating the employment of a UK and Export Sales manager \[5.1\]. Since 2008 whilst UoP have been working with the company, DMOrthotics have increased its workforce from 15 to 55, its number of units produced per week from 40 to 250, with an accompanying threefold increase in factory footprint. Further, Martin Matthews Chairman of DMOrthotics Ltd stated: *“ I can honestly say that the research directly impacted on this growth….  since working with you we have had 8 papers and multiple conference presentations …  without  this I would have been fried alive if we hadn’t had data to present … the work we have done with you has contributed to about 15% of all literature in the field”\(\[5.1\]* Such data and evidence of effectiveness is now mandatory for all Class 1 medical devices \(EU Regulation on Medical Devices 2017/745\). Our research provided the required evidence and our research training has upskilled the Company’s workforce to systematically document and submit this evidence in August 2020 \[5.7\]. 

 **Impact on clinical practice and service delivery** 

 Clinical Pathways are multidisciplinary evidence\-based management tools for a specific group of patients with a predictable clinical course; they directly influence care provision. They are a key tool used to manage the quality and outcomes of healthcare through reducing variability in clinical practice. Our research has raised awareness of the significance of pelvic pain in pregnancy in collaborating clinical academics \(e.g. Dr Lee Cameron, Clinical Lead Specialist Physiotherapist in Orthopaedics CYMRU NHS Wales\). As a direct result, in 2019 Newport NHS Trust developed and implemented a Clinical Pathway to improve the management of pelvic girdle dysfunction in women during and after pregnancy. Dr Cameron stated: “ *I developed the Clinical Pathway, which exists in the Trust, for managing women with pregnancy related PGP… As a direct result, women on this pathway could begin to access the orthotic* \(lycra support shorts\) *without barriers* \[5.8\]”. 

 As well as contributing to the development of Clinical Pathways, our researchers and research outputs have influenced educational programmes within the clinical NHS setting, thereby enhancing the expertise and practice of clinicians delivering patient care. This is highlighted by the following quote referring to training of physiotherapists in Wales and South West England: *“The Womens’ Health Team and I* \(Dr Cameron\) *were responsible for training related to ante and post\-partum PGP, and education about the orthotics* \(lycra support shorts\) *was a key element of this.  This has had considerable influence as we are one of the biggest Trusts in Wales. This knowledge, in turn has extended to other Trusts through the Advanced Practitioners training... There has been excellent feedback from the training sessions, with comments such as “I never used to treat women with this pain, but the training has provided the fantastic tools to be able to manage these women more effectively”* \[5.8\]. 

 In addition, to extend the implementation of our research findings outside the NHS, our research team has undertaken field\-based educational sessions with sports physiotherapists and sports scientists at a variety of sporting clubs and organisations including Plymouth Argyle Football Club, Bristol Rugby Football Club, Football Association at St Georges Park Football Club, Wales Women’s Football Team and Sport England. This resulted in orders of these orthoses by these clubs \[5.9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 King’s research has demonstrated that the public are largely resilient to extreme events \(e.g., terrorism, pandemics, flooding\) and highlighted the role of effective communication in informing protective health behaviours before, during, and after civil emergencies of this kind. This work demonstrates that many policies, plans, and responses for emergencies are based on inaccurate assumptions about public risk perceptions and behaviours. This can lead to situations where public behaviours overwhelm emergency response systems. Rogers and Pearce have worked with industry, emergency response, local, national, and international government organisations to enhance their ability to influence public responses to extreme events; address concerns about causing public panic when communicating; and reframe the representation of the public in emergency response processes. This has allowed King’s research to have a significant impact on policy making, planning and response for emergencies. Specifically, it has \(i\) changed the ways that public responses are incorporated in UK national risk assessments, \(ii\) repositioned behavioural science at the heart of emergency response policy, and \(iii\) informed security\-focused communication with the public and industry. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Emergency policies and plans are often based on inaccurate assumptions about public responses to extreme events. This precludes attempts to engage with members of the public, leading to suboptimal emergency response and health outcomes. King’s research has demonstrated that the public are largely resilient to extreme events; challenged the long\-held misconception of the panic\-prone public; provided evidence supporting a range of behavioural responses; and demonstrated the importance of public communication to inform protective health behaviours before, during, and after extreme events. This research has spanned seven collaborative projects designed to test and advance theories of risk perception, risk communication and behaviour to understand and inform public psychological and behavioural responses to extreme events such as terrorism and pandemics. 

 This body of research has not only extended theories of risk perception, risk communication, health and social psychology \[1\-6\], but has improved knowledge and understanding about public responses to low likelihood, high impact events \(including chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear \(CBRN\) terrorism \[1\-3\]; marauding terrorist firearms attacks \[4\], and major power outages \[6\]\). In so doing, it has helped to identify the perceived risk and information needs before, during and after a range of low likelihood high impact events \[1\-6\], developed and tested evidence\-based and theoretically driven risk communication interventions \[1\-5\] and established the extent to which interventions developed in the UK need adaptation for use in other national contexts and for different target population groups \[1\-6\]. 

 Specifically, King’s research has established that pre\-event communications designed to encourage the public to undertake protective health behaviours during a terrorist attack \(e.g. Run, Hide, Tell\) are unlikely to increase the perceived risk from terrorism but can increase trust and confidence in the government and security services’ ability to provide guidance that can keep the public safe \[1\-4\]. This research has also identified the importance of not only communicating what actions should be taken, but also advising the public about behaviours that should be avoided \[1\-4\]. Additionally, it has established that while the impact of guidance reduces over time, those who have viewed it continue to be more likely to adopt protective health behaviours than those who have received no guidance \[4\]. Finally, King’s researchers have established that general principles of risk communication hold true across a range of events and national contexts, but that guidance should be adapted to consider differing levels of trust in responding organisations \[1\-6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 King’s research has had a significant impact on policy making, planning and response for emergencies by \(i\) changing the ways that public responses are incorporated in UK national risk assessments, \(ii\) repositioning behavioural science at the heart of emergency policy, planning, and response processes and \(iii\) informing and changing security\-focused communication with the public. Based on their collective body of research \[1\-6\], Rogers and Pearce have worked closely with a range of key stakeholders to enhance the ability of these organisations to influence public responses to extreme events; address practitioner concerns about causing public panic when communicating; and change the ways in which members of the public are considered and framed in planning and response. Professor Rogers received an OBE in the 2018 New Years’ Honours List for ‘services to academia and government’ in recognition of her success in translating King’s research into evidence\-based policy and practice for the emergency services, industry and local, national and international government organisations. 

 The impact of King’s research is a direct result of the extensive engagement Rogers and Pearce have undertaken through project work and advisory roles. Engaging as independent experts, drawing on their collective body of research, they feed principles of effective risk communication into large\-scale cross government initiatives. They also provide briefings on specific project findings \[e.g. 4,5\] that inform new initiatives such as the Action Counters Terror \(ACT\) campaign, and assess the effectiveness of existing communication \(e.g. See it, Say it, Sorted; Run, Hide, Tell\) to support the development of improved messages. As a result of these extensive engagement activities specific impacts can be seen in: 

#  i: Changing National Risk Assessment methods and communication 

 \[text removed for publication\] King’s research has improved UK government’s understanding of the behavioural impacts of civil contingencies risks through Rogers’ and Pearce’s contributions to the Cabinet Office National Risk Assessment \(NRA\) and the National Security Risk Assessment \(NSRA\). The NRA and NRSA are classified cross\-government processes undertaken to identify, characterise, and compare the most significant national security hazards and threats. These assessments enable local and national government and emergency services to prepare for major emergencies. In June 2013, Rogers was asked to form/Chair the NRA Behavioural Science Expert Group \(BSEG\). BSEG was the first academic advisory board established to provide independent, evidence\-based advice for the NRA process. BSEG’s success in improving psychological measures set an example for other expert groups \[A\]. 

 As members of BSEG Rogers and Pearce \(Deputy Chair\) have advised on risk scoring for all subsequent NRAs and NSRAs. This included recommending improvements to the processes that led to the commissioning of five confidential reports, all of which were co\-authored by Rogers and Pearce. As a result, the scales used to measure the psychological impact of risk scenarios were changed, as was the framing of public disorder in events \[A\]. This in turn informed the development of a new National Resilience Planning Assumption \(NRPA\) on psychological responses co\-drafted by Pearce. NRPAs are used to identify the common consequences of NRA/NRSA risk scenarios which directly support local risk planning. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Additionally, King’s research informed the inclusion of guidance in the National Risk Register \(NRR\) \(the public facing version of the NRA/NSRA\) on what the public can do in response to these risks for the first time in 2017 \[B1\]. This guidance was further refined by Rogers and Pearce for the 2020 edition \[B2\]. This transformed the NRR from a public\-facing document written primarily for practitioners into a publicly relevant document to better enable management of personal risks. 

 As a consequence of their contribution to the NRA, Rogers and Pearce were invited by Scottish Government’s Resilience Division \(SGRD\) in 2016 to support the development of the Scottish Risk Assessment \(SRA\), a contribution which has been described as “ *instrumental in shaping the document we use today”* \[C\]. Rogers and Pearce continue to provide input into the SRA and training for the SGRD team and risk author colleagues. This training has “ *significantly improved their* \[the risk authors’\] *understanding of how to effectively assess the accuracy of psychological impact factors* \[...\] *and empowered us* \[SRGD\] *with the skills to effectively challenge our risk authors, resulting in more stringent assessment of risk”* \[C\]. 

#  ii: Reshaping and repositioning the role of behavioural science contributions to policy, planning, and response processes for disasters and extreme events. 

 Rogers and Pearce’s collective body of work \[1\-6\] and ongoing engagement with local, national and international policy makers, emergency responders, and publics has reframed policy and practitioner understandings of public responses to disasters and extreme events and formally repositioned behavioural science at the heart of emergency policy, planning, and response processes. This is evidenced by appointments to longer\-term, high\-level leadership and strategic roles \(e.g. BSEG, Home Office Science Advisory Council \(HOSAC\), The Prime Minister’s Council for Science and Technology \(CST\)\), as well as significant contributions to fast\-paced emergency events such as threats to aviation security and the COVID\-19 pandemic. 

 Rogers contributed to two Blackett Reviews, a government process in which small expert panels provide critical advice on scientific time\-sensitive questions primarily in the security domain. Notably, she was the only behavioural scientist involved in the 2017 Blackett Review where she “ *identified a key and distinct role for behavioural and human sciences in Aviation Security \(AvSEC\)”* \[D\]. Consequently, a full chapter on behavioural sciences was included in the review, rather than the few lines intended for this topic \[D\]. The report was delivered directly to the Prime Minister and the National Security Council and this “ *...led in part to Department for Transport increasing capability in AvSec and developing a new strategy to deal with highly sophisticated concealed explosives”* \[D\] *.* Rogers also co\-authored a 2018 Cabinet Office commissioned review of evidence on public responses to major power outages \[4\] \[E\]. These findings “ *on the value of early and consistent communication with the public in the wake of a power outage have been especially valuable and have been directly incorporated into a post\-incident national communications strategy which was tested by Ministers in a table\-top exercise*” \[E\]. 

 Prior to COVID\-19, Rogers used King’s research \[1\-6\] to shape government exercises and workshops, including using evidence to inform public facing information, calling for public communication when it was not taking place, and feeding evidence into conversations about critical national infrastructure performance during emergencies \[D,E,F\]. This “ *contributed to improved understanding and use of behavioural sciences during response to emergencies, leading to the Standard Operating Procedure for SAGE to require attendance of behavioural scientists during emergency responses*” \[D\]. Consequently, Rogers was invited to contribute to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) in 2014. SAGE is chaired by the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser to provide direct advice to central government during an emergency. In 2020 Rogers attended SAGE as an independent academic during the COVID\-19 pandemic. She co\-chaired the behavioural science sub\-group \(SPI\-B\), chaired the SPI\-B group on education \(SPI\-Kids\), was theme leader for the Security & Policing subgroup during the response, and contributed to the Children’s Task & Finish Group \[G\]. Rogers drew on King’s research \[1\-5\] to support the cross\-governmental response to the pandemic, including informing behaviours to reduce transmission in the workplace \[H\], neighbourhood level release/local restrictions, public gatherings, and re\-opening large events \[F\]. For example, “ *Rogers’ work on the wider impacts of and harms of school closures, as part of the SPI\-B working group on children, has provided fundamental advice supporting the policy prioritisation of schools being the first to open and the last to close during COVID\-19*” \[G\]. Additionally, Pearce contributed to a SAGE subgroup to provide science advice relating to the effects of COVID\-19 on ethnic minority groups. This included co\-authoring a report on impacts of targeted public health communications, which “ *helped inform Covid\-related government communication strategies aimed at ethnic minority groups”* \[G\]. To the end of December 2020, Rogers and Pearce's research \[1,3,5 and more\] has been cited in at least 20 SAGE reports to evidence and shape advice about public responses to COVID\-19 related challenges \(e.g. adherence and acceptability\). 

#  iii: Informing and changing security\-focused communication with the public and industry 

 King’s research \[1\-6\] directly informs security\-focused communication practices and campaigns in the UK through Rogers’ and Pearce’s long\-standing engagements with organisations such as the Home Office and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure \(CPNI\). It also informs international policy and practice, for example through Rogers’ engagement with OECD, and the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and via Pearce’s engagement with the UN Department of Safety and Security, NCTV \(the Dutch security services\) and the Swedish police. 

 Internationally, King’s research \[5\] has been used “ *to initiate and shape* \[NCTV’s\] *online risk communications campaign about ‘Run, Hide, Tell’ in the Dutch way*” \[I\]. This research also features as a case study in the Counter Terrorism Preparedness Network \(CTPN\) Community Preparedness report, which is being used to inform city\-level counter\-terrorism policies and practices across six major European cities \[J\]. 

 The Home Office benefits from Rogers’ and Pearce’s ongoing contributions through academic project briefings \(e.g. Run, Hide, Tell; See It, Say It, Sorted\), rapid responses to emergencies \(e.g. COVID\-19\), and through Rogers’ leadership of the Home Office Science Advisory Council \(HOSAC\) since April 2019. Additionally, King’s research into public attitudes and communication needs related to public security incidents \[1\-5\] led the Home Office to “ *reconsider the ways in which public bodies can communicate about these issues to members of the public*” by identifying “ *challenges that needed to be overcome” and “opportunities for communications to aid the public’s understanding and capability around security in public spaces”* \[F\]. Through HOSAC, King’s research \[1\-5\] has also been incorporated into guiding principles for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear \(CBRN\) risk communication. This guidance “ *has been shared across Government and has informed and influenced policy decisions relating to future communication campaigns”* \[F\] and now forms the basis for all public communication campaign about CBRN incidents. Rogers’ SAGE SPI\-B Policing and Security sub\-group reports into local lockdowns, public gatherings, and re\-opening large events \[1\-2,4 and others\] “ *have supported the Home Office response, and the UK Government’s response to COVID\-19 as a whole”* \[F\]. 

 Additionally, Rogers and Pearce used King’s research \[1\-5\] to inform the development and assessment of cross\-government, security\-based interventions \(Action Counters Terrorism \(ACT\)\) via engagement with the UK Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure \(CPNI\). CPNI highlighted “Of particular note here was your expert input to our baseline and evaluation questionnaire survey designs to help us achieve balance of measuring effect whilst continuing to further our fundamental understanding of barriers and facilitators of reporting in the public *”* \[H\]. CPNI went on to commission Rogers and Pearce to work on the testing and development of the ‘See it, Say it, Sorted’ campaign, based on King’s research \[5\] which “ *addressed an academic and an operational gap in understanding”,* CPNI also funded a one\-year follow up study of King’s research \[4\] to examine the longer\-term impacts of the ‘Run, Hide, Tell’ campaign \[H\]. 

 Finally, Rogers co\-authored a CPNI/SPI\-B SAGE report designed to inform behaviours to reduce transmission in the workplace to enable Critical National Infrastructure \(CNI\) organisations to continue to function securely during COVID\-19. This work “ *provided evidence for and emphasised the importance of co\-creation and a sense of shared responsibility in developing and maintaining COVID\-secure workplaces*” \[H\]. It was part of a larger CPNI workplace behaviour campaign designed to help organisations manage security risks throughout COVID\-19 “ *which in itself drew upon the KCL insights* \[5\] *generated by the CPNI funded project on See It, Say It, Sorted \(indeed all previous work with KCL\)”* to generate “ *the most engaged with and downloaded campaign on our CPNI website in 2020*” \(receiving over 14,000 unique views and similar levels of downloads between March and May 2020\) \[H\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 *Well Communities* is a community development evidence\-based framework, enabling communities and local organisations to work together to improve health and wellbeing. The long\-term research and development programme has significantly improved wellbeing in participating communities through improving levels of physical activity, healthy eating, mental wellbeing, social connectedness and volunteering. 

 *Locally*, it has shaped city\-wide policy. *Nationally*, it has informed the development of guidelines for community engagement to reduce health inequalities. *Internationally*, it has been recognised and utilised as a novel approach to community welfare. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Improving health and reducing health inequalities remain major global challenge for healthcare providers. Increasing levels of non\-communicable diseases \(NCDs\), mental health problems and a prevalence of damaging health behaviors are placing increasing pressure on health services and charities, exacerbated in disadvantaged communities. In 2016, UK life expectancy at birth ranged from 78.8 years in the most deprived areas to 86.7 years in the most affluent. *Well Communities* develops effective approaches for improving fundamental economic and social structures to improve health through community co\-produced models of healthcare. **\(R1\)** 

 Over the past 12 years, a novel theory of change has been developed which centres on psycho\-social pathways to impact rather than behavioural change; the product of this iterative development is the third and current phase of Well Communities. 

 Well Communities provides a framework for communities and local organisations \(public, private and third sector\) to work together to improve health and wellbeing, build resilience and reduce health inequalities, comprised of a suite of capacity building and co\-developed projects that realise under\-utilised community resources and build individual and community trust in skills, knowledge, confidence, empowerment and connectedness. 

 Figure 1. Map of Deprived Areas in London and Well Communities participating neighbourhoods 



The *Well Communities* approach has been developed through the Well London Programme, which was launched in 20 small local areas across 20 of the most deprived London boroughs in 2007. **\(R2\)** 

 As part of its leading role in this programme, researchers developed a methodology for <ins>C</ins>ommunity and <ins>S</ins>takeholder <ins>E</ins>ngagement <ins>A</ins>ssessment and co\-<ins>D</ins>esign \(CSEAD\). Used to complement data driven methods, CSEAD gathers valuable community, patient, staff and other stakeholder insights into causes and provides solutions to challenges. A mixed research methodology is used including: a series of 1\-1 doorstep conversations; community ‘world café’ workshops; translations into potential solutions through ‘Co\-producing Action Workshops’. **\(R3\)** 

 The first phase of Well London \(2007 – 2011\) identified the key community\-perceived needs affecting health and wellbeing addressing them with a suite of projects in communities such as: Newham, Tower Hamlets, Brent **\(R3\)**. The recommendations were assimilated into the development and evaluation of the second phase of Well London \(2012 – 2015\) with further funding from the Big Lottery \(1.8million GBP\). Phase 2 moved to a locally commissioned model, focussed on testing replicability in any neighbourhood and, in some areas, the scalability of the approach to larger neighbourhoods/ regeneration areas. **\(R4\)** 

 In Phase 3, *Well Communities* was utilised in the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Greenwich to inform approaches to Public Health programmes, developing a blueprint for quality improvement in primary care and recently to assist at\-risk communities through the COVID\-19 pandemic.

###  4. Details of Impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **1. Collaboration with government and public health organisations** 

 
The ground\-breaking participation rate and overall positive behavioural change earned the CSEAD methodology recognition by Mayor of London Health Policy Team.  In 2015/2016, Professor Findlay was commissioned to define the scope and options for future action by the Mayor of London as part of a systems approach across London.  In 2019, Professor Findlay was again commissioned by Mayor of London to run ‘masterclass’ courses in Community Development for Health, an initiative to unite healthcare providers, charity organisations and communities to understand best practice. **\(S1\)** 

 Figure 2. Masterclass discussion 

The research further informed and shaped the Mayor of London’s health policy and Health Inequalities Strategy in 2018, and the significance of the approach is reflected by the Mayor’s key objective that “Londoners are empowered to improve their own and their communities’ health and wellbeing”. The new community\-led policy promotes and ensures local involvement and commitment in shaping and implementing health and well\-being practices. **\(S2\)** 

 Professor Findlay and the IHHD Well Communities team served as experts in the development of National Institute for Healthcare Excellence’s \(NICE\) guidelines for addressing community engagement and reducing health inequalities. **\(S3\)** 

 **2. Applying methodology in international communities** 

 Because the nature of the methodology identifies and prioritises local needs, it attracted recognition from several international bodies of health experts such as CHRODIS **\(S4a\)**, an EU joint action programme, and assisted organisations establishing international relationships **\(S4b\)**. 

 Additionally, in the face of the pandemic, Well Communities’ approach was used in Sierra Leone and Zambia, to train and support volunteers as they protect disadvantaged and vulnerable people. As of December 2020, 17,000 food packages have been distributed and in\-person community sensitisation sessions have been held in 14 districts, reaching over 5,500 people directly. They influenced the inclusion of children with disabilities in the Zambian Ministry of Health COVID\-19 customer care training countrywide and, within the communities they serve, they have inspired and motivated long\-term volunteers by being a visible presence during this health emergency. **\(S5\)** 

 The *Well Communities* framework has similarly been used in Greenwich Borough and the 12 communities which already had ongoing projects to support at\-risk and disadvantaged communities to combat isolation and to engage with severely deprived neighbourhoods during the pandemic. The government in the Netherlands has likewise considered *Well Communities* during their pandemic response. **\(S6\)** 

 
**3. Improvements in community health and wellbeing** 

 


 Figure 3. Visitors and MP Matthew Pennycook enjoy Woolwich Carnival 

At the outset of Well London Phase 2, targets were set for participation and for five outcome areas: physical activity, healthy eating, mental wellbeing; social connectedness; and volunteering as indicators of improvements to health and wellbeing. Close to 19,000 London residents participated in activities across eleven of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in London and the final evaluation of phase 2 showed significant improvement across all five outcome areas. **\(S7\)** 

 Interviews carried out with Well London participants provided elaboration of the benefits of the programme in each targeted area and the final evaluation report showed numbers significantly exceeding the targets set by the researchers **\(S7a\).**

 Figure 5. Well London\- Woolwich Dockyard team welcome their newest member 



*“I like meeting people here.* You’ve *got people coming with their babies, 80\-year\-olds and people in their 20s all cooking in the same kitchen and eating together, for me that’s a healthy thing in itself, people all eating together.” \(Female, adult, Hackney.\)* **\(S7d\)** 

 Participants reported feeling happier and healthier overall and many felt that the programme motivated positive change in their daily lives and neighborhood. **\(S8\)** 

 The enduring effect on the communities which *Well Communities* served can be felt through focused projects, targeting specific groups with special vulnerabilities. The REACH pregnancy programme had particular success in supporting mothers, providing antenatal education and care and improving birth outcomes **\(S9\)** while the Tower Hamlets initiative, ‘Communities Driving Change’ continues to provide advice, training, action learning and coaching **\(S6\).** The true value of such sustained and monumental change to personal and community lives is unquantifiable.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 UofG research finds that Universal Credit \(the UK working age benefit\) and benefit sanctions \(removal of income to prompt job\-seeking activities\) have long\-term harmful effects, which undermine their policy objectives. Through extensive engagement with policymakers, these findings have influenced policy changes to lessen their harms. From 2015 onwards, the research informed the UK Government’s decisions to: \(i\) reduce the maximum benefit sanction from 3 years to 6 months; \(ii\) remove call charges for the national helpline. In Scotland, the research informed the introduction of: \(iii\) sanction\-free employment services for long\-term ill and disabled people; \(iv\) devolved Universal Credit ‘flexibilities’. The reach of the research has been extended internationally through engagement with the OECD. The beneficiaries are over 8.5 million claimants who face reduced risk of poverty and destitution.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **2.1. Overview** 

 The impacts reported in this case study are based upon the first major study of Welfare Conditionality \(sanctions, support and behaviour change\) in the UK. An ESRC large grant was originally awarded over the period 2013–2018, subsequently extended until 2019. This funding supported fieldwork conducted between 2014–2017 in 11 sites, three in Scotland and eight in England. It consisted of 52 policymaker/influencer interviews, 27 practitioner focus groups \(with a total of 156 participants\) and 1,082 qualitative interviews \(with 481 ‘users’ over three waves\). 

 The University of York \(Principal Investigator, Professor Peter Dwyer\) was the hub for this collaborative project involving six universities, 13 researchers, two support staff and eight PhD students. At the University of Glasgow \(UofG\), Professor Sharon Wright \(Co\-I\) led the multi\-site research teams on Universal Credit, Jobseekers and Social Security in Scotland. Dr Alasdair Stewart worked within the disability \(including mental health\) and migrants research teams. 

 **2.2. Investigating the UK’s benefit sanction system** 

 The project investigated whether the UK’s 2012 benefit sanction system, reckoned by experts to be the second harshest in the world, was \(a\) effective; or \(b\) ethical. Outputs **\[3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]** found that benefit claimants experienced sanctions as: 

-  Neither effective nor ethical in encouraging job entry or progression; 

-  Far too harsh, triggered easily without warning and ramping\-up quickly for unmanageably lengthy periods \(e.g. up to three years or indefinitely\); 

-  Unjust and disproportionate to the ‘offence’ \(e.g. immediate loss of one month’s benefit for once missing a Jobcentre appointment\); 

-  Counterproductive, preventing effective job search; 

-  A trigger for severe suffering, causing or worsening mental and physical health problems, poverty, debt, rent arrears, housing insecurity and risk of destitution; 

-  Of minimal help in finding sustainable paid employment. 

 **2.3. The Universal Credit work package** 

 The Universal Credit work package \(led by Wright at the UofG\) was the first independent study of how this globally\-innovative policy affects claimants. Universal Credit fundamentally reforms means\-tested out\-of\-work benefits \(e.g. for unemployed people, lone parents and disabled people\) by combining them with earnings top\-ups and payments for children and housing \(for those who would previously have claimed Working Tax Credits\). The research **\[3.3, 3.4\]** found many problems with the design and implementation of Universal Credit, including new financial risks that deepen and extend poverty, and increase the risk of destitution. For example: 

-  The unmanageably\-high cost of the telephone support line, meaning claimants had to use their limited income on administration, instead of essentials like food; 

  

-  Long gaps without income \(6\-10 weeks\) between applying for Universal Credit and receiving the first payment, caused by an increased number of waiting days \(relative to the benefits it replaces\) and new administrative burdens \(e.g. evidencing long\-standing rent levels\); 

-  Inadequate benefit rates that include the housing element paid directly to claimants rather than transferred to landlords, as was previously the case \(this increases the risk of rent arrears and eviction\); 

-  Inadequate work allowances, which mean, contrary to the policy promise, claimants are often not financially better off in work. 

 Key messages for policy change were shared with policymakers via UofG\-funded dissemination and engagement activities \(led by Wright\) in advance of the launch of the research findings in May 2016 **\[3.4, 3.5\]** and May 2018 **\[3.3, 3.6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1. Pathways to impact** 

 Since 2015, through extensive dissemination activities \(e.g. over 203 conference presentations and 148,551  [<ins>webpage</ins>](http://www.welfareconditionality.ac.uk/) visits\) and direct engagement with policymakers \(e.g. John Griffiths AM, Jamie Hepburn MSP and Sandra White MSP\), the underpinning research has generated three explicit citations in House of Commons debates; 27 formal responses to inquiries and consultations \(e.g. the Work and Pensions Committee\); 36 briefings to parliamentarians and 52 citations in official reports \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[5A\]**\). On the basis of the underpinning research, Professor Wright was appointed as an Expert Advisor to the Social Security Committee, Scottish Parliament \(2016–2019\). Through these channels, the research has provided evidence to inform policy at UK\-level and in Scotland in the following ways: 

 **4.2. Informing the UK\-wide reduction of maximum benefit sanctions** 

 In 2019, the underpinning research provided evidence to inform the UK Government’s decision to reduce the maximum Universal Credit benefit sanction from 3 years to 6 months. The research report on Universal Credit **\[3.3\]** recommends that the length and severity of financial benefit sanctions should be reduced to ensure ‘<ins> *proportionality*</ins>’ and ‘ *human dignity’*. It concludes that, ‘ *stringent sanctions \[…\] could be <ins>counterproductive</ins> in creating unnecessary barriers to paid work’*. On 9 May 2019, the then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Amber Rudd, announced that the maximum sanction would be reduced from 3 years to 6 months. Rudd said: *‘I want to ensure that the penalties for not meeting these conditions are <ins>proportionate</ins>, particularly for the most vulnerable \[…\] I will end financial sanctions for welfare claimants that last for three years. Such sanctions were rarely used but I believe they were <ins>counterproductive</ins> and ultimately undermined our goal of supporting people into work’* \(confirmed by transcript **\[5B\]**\). 

  

 Given the similarities between the research recommendations and the wording of Rudd’s statement, a Freedom of Information request was made in order to establish a direct link between the two. The response **\[5C\]** states that, *‘Following the initial Government response to the Work and Pensions Select Committee in their November 2018 report on Benefit Sanctions, we gave further consideration to the Committee’s recommendation on higher\-level sanctions. At this point the decision was made to amend this policy’.* The report in question **\[5D\]** directly cites the underpinning research on seven occasions \(specifically in establishing evidence of the counterproductivity of sanctions\). Despite the fact that the maximum sanction was rarely used, this decision has benefitted over 6.8 million claimants since December 2019 **\[5A\]**, as the research **\[3.3\]** finds the *threat* of lengthy sanctions to be a trigger for severe suffering, linked to mental and physical health problems. 

  

 **4.3. Informing the UK\-wide removal of Universal Credit helpline call charges** 

 In September 2017, Professor Sharon Wright \(UofG\) and Dr Lisa Scullion \(University of Salford\) gave evidence to the Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee \(ELGCC\), National Assembly of Wales, on the failings of Universal Credit. This included evidence on the unaffordable call costs for the helpline, which were as high as GBP0.55 per minute \( **\[3.4\]** was the <ins>only research</ins> highlighting this issue at the time\). As a direct result of their recommendation to remove call charges, John Griffiths AM, Chair of ELGCC, wrote to the then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, David Gauke on 11 October 2017 **\[5E\]**. Although Gauke’s official response to Griffiths’ letter \(dated 1 November 2017\) dismissed concerns over the cost of the helpline, one week after Griffiths’ letter \(on 18 October 2017\), in response to widespread criticism, Gauke announced that the helpline would be made free of charge. The ELGCC report **\[5F\]** states that, *‘witnesses told us that a simple, but very helpful, action would be for the number to be made free \[…\] We strongly supported this suggestion, and are pleased that this change has been made.’* 

 A Freedom of Information request first obtained by the BBC **\[5G\]**, established that in September 2017, 'live' helpline customers were on the phone for an average of 7min 20sec once their call was answered. Those waiting the average time for their call to be answered could have been paying up to GBP7.63 \(with GBP3.59 of this spent before they had spoken to anyone\). While this may seem like a relatively small amount, during the initial five\-week wait for benefits, many claimants will have zero income, so these charges could push them into debt. In September 2017 alone, a total of 743,435 calls were made to both helplines \(the ‘full’ and ‘live’ services\), 624,980 of which were answered **\[5G\]**. The decision to make the helpline free of charge has benefitted a caseload of over 8.5 million Universal Credit claimants since December 2017 **\[5A\]**, thus reducing the risks of extreme poverty and destitution by allowing claimants to use their limited income on essentials such as food, rent and energy bills. 

 **4.4. The introduction of sanction\-free employment services in Scotland** 

 In 2016, UofG research provided evidence to inform the introduction of sanction\-free devolved employment services \(designed to help unemployed people with health problems back to work in Scotland\). This benefitted 5,527 Work First Scotland and Work Able Scotland users \(2017–2018\) and an ongoing caseload of approximately 27,076 users of the GBP96m Fair Start Scotland programme from 2018 onwards \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[5H\]**\). On 8 September 2016, Wright presented research findings **\[3.4, 3.5\]** on the ineffectiveness and harmfulness of benefit sanctions to the Scottish Parliament. The next day, the then Convenor of the Social Security Committee, Sandra White, wrote to the UK Secretary of State for Work and Pensions at the time, Damian Green, quoting Wright’s evidence to request an urgent review of the claimant conditionality and the sanction regime. 

  

 White subsequently lodged a Scottish Parliament Motion based upon the research findings **\[5I\]**. On 2 November 2016, in the Scottish Parliament Debate of the Motion, 10 MSPs \(SNP, Labour and Conservative\) made explicit use of UofG evidence **\[3.4, 3.5\]** attracting significant  [<ins>media coverage</ins>](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/dr-sharon-wright-9176781). During the debate, the then Minister for Employability and Training, Jamie Hepburn, announced sanctions\-free Scottish employment services, directly citing the influence of UofG research \(confirmed by transcript **\[5J\]**\). The next day \(3 November 2016\), Damian Green appeared at the Scottish Parliament Social Security Committee and was challenged repeatedly on sanctions by MSPs explicitly citing UofG research **\[3.4, 3.5\]**. During the session, Green confirmed that the Scottish Government would have power over conditionality and sanctions for employability programmes \(confirmed by transcript **\[5K\]**\). 

  

 **4.5. The introduction of new ‘Scottish flexibilities’ for Universal Credit** 

 The Scottish Parliament also negotiated new ‘flexibilities’ for the implementation of Universal Credit in Scotland. This means that, unlike the other parts of the UK, claimants in Scotland can choose to receive their Universal Credit payment fortnightly rather than monthly—and have the option of the housing element being paid directly to landlords, which can reduce the risks of rent arrears and evictions. This decision was directly informed by UofG research **\[3.5\]** \(as outlined below\), which was <ins>the only evidence at the time</ins> to identify how Universal Credit was failing in Scotland. 

 On 27 October 2015, Wright presented findings to Scottish Government civil servants, recommending defaulting to fortnightly \(rather than monthly\) payments and payment of the housing element to landlords as default. This was reiterated in the interim report **\[3.5\]**, which was presented to Scottish Government officials \(on 9 June 2016\) and reinforced in a formal written response to the Scottish Parliament consultation on Social Security in Scotland \(on 31 October 2016\) **\[5L\]**. The then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Damian Green, was subsequently pushed by MSPs \(directly citing the influence of UofG research\) to expedite Universal Credit flexibilities in Scotland on 3 November 2016. He said, *‘There is clearly evidence on both sides, but I will always make a commitment to looking at evidence.’* \(confirmed by transcript **\[5K\]**\). As a result of sustained pressure, new Scottish welfare powers were subsequently  [<ins>announced</ins>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38601944) by the then Social Security Minister, Jeane Freeman, on 13 January 2017. Between October 2017 and the end of March 2020, a total of 147,000 new claimants who were offered took up one or both choices, enabling quicker access to essential income for food and bills \(confirmed by report **\[5M\]**\) 

 **4.6. International engagement** 

 Wright presented the underpinning research findings to OECD economists on 1 February 2019. An OECD representative later confirmed that they had discussed the UofG research with the UK Treasury, who were already aware of the findings. A subsequent OECD Economic Survey of the UK **\[5N\]** directly cites the underpinning research **\[3.5\]** as evidence that punitive conditions discourage households with the greatest needs from applying for, or maintaining enrolment in, Universal Credit. It notes that, *‘Recognising these issues, the Government has abolished some sanctions, is reviewing others, and the share of Universal Credit recipients receiving sanctions has been declining since 2018.’* Notably, a subsequent Sanctions Statistics Briefing \(2020\), also cited by the OECD, found that the Universal Credit sanction rate reduced substantially between March 2018 and August 2019 from 8.5% to 2.3% \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[5N\]**\). This significant reduction in sanction rates correlates with the use of the underpinning research within the national policy arena, as outlined above.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Hydration is a fundamental care need which if neglected can lead to numerous adverse health outcomes, including infection, especially in the elderly. The University of West London’s I\-Hydrate project identified how simple changes in practices and staff awareness could lead to significant boosts to fluid intake. The project team produced a resource pack based on these findings, and this has been used by public health teams, NHS trusts and social care providers to undertake hydration improvement initiatives.  These initiatives have led to greater fluid intake by patients, care home residents and service users.  Additionally, a commercial provider of digital health products is incorporating the I\-Hydrate resources into an app for social care staff which will help them improve their clients’ hydration. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The I\-Hydrate research project was undertaken in units for the frail elderly in two West London care homes, and led by Wilson and Loveday of the University of West London’s Richard Wells Centre. The aims of the project were to optimise the hydration of care home residents, decrease dehydration and associated morbidity, and therefore improve the quality and safety of care. 

 This 18\-month project began in October 2015.  A local team was created in each of the two homes, including the unit manager, nurses, healthcare assistants, as well as residents and their relatives. The study used a pragmatic observational design and multiple data collection methods to support the development of practical solutions to the problems identified. 

 The study first determined how much fluid residents consumed, and factors associated with consumption including how hydration was organised, delivered and monitored, as well as the fluid and drinking vessel preferences of residents.  This baseline assessment found that hydration was not recognised as a care priority; that residents’ mean daily fluid consumption was only 1000ml, with no residents consuming the recommended minimum of 1500ml; and that there were infrequent opportunities for residents to be offered a drink or assisted to take one. Fluid intakes were not routinely documented, records not reliable and there was a lack of systems in place to enable a timely response to poor intakes.  The study identified the challenges experienced by care homes and residents in meeting this care need and demonstrated the importance of a coherent strategy in improving hydration in this population. \[R1\] 

 These initial findings informed subsequent improvement work. Strategies to improve fluid consumption were directed at all residents, as the findings indicated that all were at risk of under\-hydration regardless of their level of need. The study used quality improvement methods to develop and test interventions to extend drinking opportunities and choice in the two care homes. Changes were made and evaluated using Plan\-Do\-Study\-Act \(PDSA\) cycles. 

 Data were captured on the amounts of fluid served and consumed, and on staff and resident feedback following interventions. The long\-term impact of the interventions was assessed by measuring daily laxative and antibiotic consumption, weekly incidence of adverse health events, and average fluid intake of a random sample of six residents captured monthly. The interventions were associated with an increase in the amount and range of fluids consumed.  In one home, mean fluid intakes exceeded the recommended minimum 1500ml for three consecutive months. Laxative use decreased significantly in both homes. Practical and organisational barriers were found to affect the sustainability of interventions. \[R2\] 

 As part of the programme, the research team designed, delivered, and evaluated an interactive training session to improve the knowledge and skills of care home staff in supporting the hydration of residents. Eighteen sessions were delivered, and 161 participant evaluation forms returned. Training facilitators captured qualitative data in the form of ﬁeld notes and observations of hydration care explored the impact of training on practice. The study found 1\) that focused training on hydration in the care home environment beneﬁts from being interactive and experiential, and 2\) that although such training could be eﬀective in increasing staﬀ knowledge, inclusion of skills in reﬂective practice was required to translate this into practice. \[R3\] 

 An important component of the research was establishing the resident perspective.  The research team systematically tested residents’ opinion of different types of fluid and drinking vessels and as a result established that increasing choice of drink to meet resident preferences is important to enhance intake and that the drinking vessels in common use in UK healthcare settings were very poorly designed for use by the frail elderly. \[R4\] 

 Utilising these findings, the UWL research team created downloadable practical resources for care homes, also available as 76\-page document; a video series for use in care homes; and an infographic with hints on preventing hydration in older people. These resources were all made freely accessible on the University website. \[R5\] 

 This work informed a successful application to the National Institute for Health Research RfPB Research for Social Care stream to investigate the feasibility of establishing a dysphagia link\-practitioner in residential settings to prevent adverse outcomes for people with swallowing difficulties. This further study commenced in October 2019; it was originally due for completion in October 2020, but was extended to May 2021 following the onset of the COVID\-19 pandemic.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Hydration is a fundamental care need.  If neglected, it can lead to numerous adverse health outcomes including urinary tract infections \(UTI\) and Escherichia coli \(E. coli\) bloodstream infections, especially in the elderly. These infections have become more prevalent in recent years and are associated with a high morbidity and mortality; reducing their incidence has become an NHS priority. 

 The I\-Hydrate resources have given public health teams, NHS trusts and social care providers a series of simple solutions to help address these issues amongst elderly people. The resources have been used to improve hydration practices and increase staff knowledge and awareness, leading to greater fluid intake by patients, care home residents and service users.  Additionally, a commercial provider of digital health products is incorporating the I\-Hydrate resources into an app for social care staff. In some instances, as noted below, organisations have paused wider implementation under the pressures of the COVID\-19 pandemic but have said they intend to re\-start when the situation changes. 

 In May 2019, I\-Hydrate was featured in the Universities UK’s *MadeAtUni* campaign, *the Lifesavers – 100\+ ways universities are saving lives and keeping us healthy*.  \[S1\] 

####  The I\-Hydrate resource pack 

 The I\-Hydrate resource pack has four sections: hydration and the care home environment; improving practice and the Plan\-Do\-Study\-Act cycle; strategies to improve hydration; training your staff.  There are also five videos to support use of these resources. \[see R5\] 

 The University’s data analytics showed that between September 2018 and December 2020 there were 567 unique downloads of the resource pack and over 11,500 unique page views. The “introduction to hydration” video was played over 550 times, and the hydration care and audit sheet appendices were each downloaded almost 500 times. \[S2\] 

 Feedback survey forms were sent by the research team to users who downloaded the pack and left contact details.  A total of 14 forms were returned by December 2020, and feedback on the pack included the comments from two users as below: 

 As the nutritionist I have created and delivered hydration training to all our staff. I have also updated and introduced a 35\-page hydration policy which is bespoke to our setting and from this there is monitoring and evaluation tasks for me to complete to monitor our hydration procedures and make changes where required. I also have a designated board which is currently on the topic of hydration. Generally, more awareness for both staff and residents. 

 This was a great resource for care homes, was easy to follow and resources could be implemented easily by managers at homes.  I particularly liked the resources that focused staff on personal reflection about hydration to then put it into context of how this impacts on residents. 

 A full set of the responses received are included with the sources of evidence for this impact case. \[S3\] 

 The I\-Hydrate’ project video was one of the six resources to improve hydration in care homes featured on the NHS England webpage on “Reducing Gram\-negative bloodstream infections – hydration”. \[S4\] 

####  National training programme for care staff in Wales 

 In 2019, Public Health Wales \(PHW\) commissioned a national training programme from the I\-Hydrate project team after learning about the research at the annual Healthcare Infection Society conference. The training programme was targeted at care home staff and community teams across Wales and aimed to improve resident hydration using the tools and methods in the I\-Hydrate resource pack, thereby reducing urinary tract and E. coli bloodstream infections. 

 A “train the trainer” programme was delivered by Wilson and Loveday for PHW in February and March 2020 with a total of 112 residential and care home staff attending.  PHW have reported that: 

 The programme was highly evaluated on both days training, and improvement plans including use of I\-Hydrate and other methodologies were in the process of being developed by a number of the care homes and improvement teams; however, the COVID\-19 pandemic has created considerable challenges in the social care sector and we have been unable to move this forward at the pace we had anticipated. 

 The I\-Hydrate project is also featured on the PHW UTI webpage as the listed resource pack for Hydration. \[S5\] 

####  Local care system initiatives – Hertfordshire and Kirklees / Wakefield 

 The I\-Hydrate research and resource pack has been used to underpin initiatives to improve hydration and prevent UTI in both acute healthcare and long\-term care settings. 

 In Hertfordshire in 2019, the I\-Hydrate team supported a 90\-day quality initiative improvement project co\-ordinated by the Clinical Commissioning Group \(CCG\) to reduce UTI across seven acute and community organisations.  Project leads from each of the seven organisations worked with an I\-Hydrate researcher to identify how they could use the I\-Hydrate tools to improve the hydration of their patients or clients. 

 In the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, the improvement project focused on two elderly care wards where it highlighted the poor fluid intake among patients. Initiatives introduced included protected drinks time, assessment of patient’s needs to support drinking and increased focus on staff supporting patients to drink. These initiatives 1\) increased the overall amount of fluids drunk, and the number of patients drinking at least 1500ml a day; 2\) led to changed staff practices to provide more support for drinking; and 3\) increased staff awareness of the problem. 

 In West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust the improvement project was focused on wards for patients waiting for transfer of care.  The outcomes reported were that 1\) the amount of fluid consumed increased by an average of 400ml per patient each shift; 2\) staff awareness of the importance of hydration improved; and 3\) overall patient satisfaction increased. 

 Infection Prevention and Control lead staff for both organisations have reported that although roll\-out of these strategies was interrupted by the pandemic, they plan to proceed once activity returns to normal. \[S6\] 

 Similar strategies were implemented in a care unit in the mental health trust and two care homes. An independent living service for people with dementia used the drinks menu to extend choice and changed their mugs so that they were larger and easier to hold.  These changes led to a 35% increase in the amount of fluid drunk by the service users. \[S7\] 

 The Infection Prevention and Control \(IPC\) Team for Kirklees and Wakefield Councils used the I\-Hydrate resource pack as the principal tool in a Hydration Champions initiative that began in 2019 and engaged all their care home and domiciliary care providers.  Following a launch, Hydration Champions were given a hard copy of the I\-Hydrate resource pack to take back to their place of work.  The resources were used to identify problems with how residents were hydrated, and design solutions which were implemented over a 6\-month period using quality improvement methods. Solutions adopted included increased choice of drinks, regular blind tasting sessions to find new favourites and larger drinking vessels.  One care home reported a reduction in residents treated by their GP for a UTI in the summer months from 12 in 2018 to 2 in 2019.  The lead IPC staff for the initiative reported that the learning from the Hydration Champion project has resulted in changes in practice in the participating areas, which has been shared across Kirklees and Wakefield. \[S8\] 

####  Developing digital solutions for care homes using I\-Hydrate resources 

 While many residential care settings have limited access to technology, the use of app\-based tools is increasing.  I\-Hydrate is being developed for that market by Elaros 24/7 Ltd, a Sheffield\-based company with a portfolio of digital health products focused on the needs of older people. Working with the UWL research team, Elaros have digitised the I\-Hydrate tools to integrate them into one of their existing hydration monitoring applications.  The company CEO has written to say: 

 We identified these resources would enhance the value of our digital solution to fluid monitoring in care homes \(Hydr8\) as it would provide care staff with information about the problems associated with dehydration and simple strategies to overcome poor fluid intakes in residents identified by the monitoring system. We have therefore developed the I\-Hydrate resources into a digital solution which will make them more accessible to staff in care homes than the document format. 

 The CEO further reported that although the timeframe of the development programme had been affected by the COVID\-19 pandemic, they were confident that the digital solution will be a valuable product that can be sold across the care home sector and used to support better hydration for care home residents, improving their quality of life and standard of care. \[S9\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study details a research project undertaken by Associate Professor Shelley Piasecka, which examined the potential for Theatre\-in\-Education \(TIE\) to offer non\-discriminatory and holistic ways of delivering UK counter\-terrorism strategies. The European Parliament Anti\-Racism and Diversity Intergroup \(ARDI\) adopted Piasecka’s research findings to inform the work of the EU in combatting terrorism and youth radicalisation and her research was instrumental in the convening of an expert conference at the European Parliament to coincide with International Refugee Day \(2018\). Piasecka’s research findings have also provided opportunities for practitioners to critically reflect upon and evaluate their work with young people on the subject of terrorism and violent extremism. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research was undertaken between 2016\-2018 and was a new interdisciplinary study in the intersection between the Performing Arts and the Social and Political Sciences. The research was undertaken by Shelley Piasecka, Associate Professor of Theatre and Applied Drama in the Department of Music, Media and Performance at the University of Chester. The underpinning research stage was funded with competitive Quality Research grants. 

 <ins>2.1 Research Context</ins> 

 The research context was informed with critical readings on PREVENT \(Heath\-Kelly 2012; Qureshi 2015; Busher et al 2017\), and the cultural impact of the war on terror for young British Muslims \(Lynch 2013; Qurashi 2018\). Research in the Performing Arts, specifically in the field of educational theatre, has tended to focus on the transformational, social, and aesthetic qualities of the art form; see, for example, Bartlett, *Not in my Name* \(2011\) and Winston and Strand, *Tapestry and the aesthetics of theatre in education as dialogic encounter and civil exchange* \(2013\). While TIE is well established in UK schools, anti\-extremist work is a fairly new development. There is very little research that examines TIE against a critical reading of UK PREVENT, and the impact of the global war on terror on young British Muslims. 

 <ins>2.2 Methodology</ins> 

 In 2016, Piasecka observed two Prevent\-funded anti\-extremist TIE projects: *Game On* \(Reveal Theatre\) and *Tapestry* \(The Play House\), carried out in situ at secondary schools in the cities of Stoke\-on\-Trent and Birmingham. In Stoke\-on\-Trent, the majority of the learners were white British, 

 and in Birmingham, the majority were from BAME and minority backgrounds. All schools were co\-educational and the learners were aged 11\-14 years. The observational findings were supported by in\-depth qualitative interviews with drama facilitators, actors, and artistic directors. Piasecka also interviewed artistic directors from 2engage Performing Arts on their Anti\-Racist TIE project, *Love & Hate,* which was funded by Lancashire Police and Blackpool Council *.* 

 <ins>2.3 Findings</ins> 

 A review of the literature suggests that a disproportionate focus on Islamist forms of terrorism in the Prevent Duty Strategy was a contributory factor in the construction of Islamophobia and anti\-Muslim sentiment, while Far Right extremism and other forms of terrorism were largely overlooked. Plus, the targeted allocation of Prevent funding reinforced discriminatory beliefs that some communities were more vulnerable to extremism than others. Notwithstanding these concerns, the research found that anti\-extremist TIE has the potential to make a positive contribution to the development of critical thinking on the causes of terrorism and violent extremism with young people. Moreover, anti\-extremist TIE resists a polarised reading of terrorism as a Muslim concern because it brings into the frame the interdependency of Far Right and Islamist forms of terrorism. 

 <ins>2.4 Research Outputs</ins> 

 The findings were published in a peer\-reviewed article for *Critical Studies on Terrorism*, Taylor & Francis, 2019 \[3:1\]. As an indicator of the journal’s esteem, the Editor\-in\-Chief is Richard Jackson – a pre\-eminent scholar in the field of Critical Terrorism Studies. The Editorial Board includes Noam Chomsky \( *MIT*, USA\); Charlotte Heath\-Kelly \( *University of Warrick*, UK\); Louise Richardson \( *University of St Andrews*, UK\); and Michael Stohl *\(University of California, Santa Barbara,* USA *\).* 

 The research findings were disseminated at conferences and symposiums in England \(2017; 2018\), Vic, Catalonia \(2017\), and Brussels, Belgium \(2018\). In 2018, Piasecka presented a TEDx talk on the theme \[3:2\] *.*

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of Piasecka’s research is evidenced in three areas. First, the European Parliament Anti\-Racism and Diversity Intergroup \(ARDI\) adopted her findings to inform the work of the EU in combatting terrorism and youth radicalisation. Piasecka’s research was instrumental in the convening of an expert conference at the European Parliament to coincide with International Refugee Day \(2018\). Second, Piasecka’s observations of anti\-extremist TIE has helped UK MEPs and staff to identify new and innovative ways of preventing young people from being drawn into terrorism. Third, albeit ancillary to the first two, the research findings have provided opportunities for practitioners to critically reflect upon and evaluate their work with young people. 

 <ins>4.1 Beneficiaries</ins> 

-  Alfiaz Vaiya: Coordinator of the European Parliament Anti\-Racism and Diversity Intergroup \(2015\-2019\). 

-  Julie Ward: MEP North West Region \(2014\-2020\). 

-  Sajjad Karim: MEP North West Region \(2014\-2019\). 

-  Anita Tusar: Political Advisor on Extremism, European Parliament. 

-  Figen Murray: Peace Campaigner. 

-  Ed Morris and Phil Goss: Artistic Directors of *2engage Performing Arts.* 

-  Associate Professor Robert Marsden: Head of Media and Performance at Staffordshire University and freelance theatre director. 

 <ins>4.2 Pathways to Impact</ins> 

 Between 2016\-2018, Piasecka attended the European Parliament \(Brussels\), to meet with parliamentary members and staff responsible for shaping EU responses to the threats of domestic and global terrorism: Trevor MacFarlane, Cultural Affairs Manager, Office of Julie Ward MEP; Anita Tusar, Advisor to Extremist Working Group; Julie Ward MEP and Alfiaz Vaiya, former coordinator of the European Parliament Anti\-Racism and Diversity Intergroup \(ARDI\). 

 The dates for the meetings were as follows: 

-  Trevor MacFarlane: 18/03/16 \(Manchester office\). 

-  Anita Tusar: 26/04/2016 \(Brussels Parliament\) 

-  Julie Ward MEP: 26/04/2016 \(Brussels Parliament\) 

-  Alfiaz Vaiya: 27/04/2016 \(Brussels Parliament\) 

 From these initial meetings, Piasecka formed an impact pathway with Alfiaz Vaiya and the European Anti\-Racism and Diversity Intergroup \(ARDI\). The remit of ARDI is to promote racial equality and to challenge discrimination in the work of the European Parliament. This pathway enabled Piasecka to raise her research findings with key Parliamentary beneficiaries. In 2017, on Vaiya’s invite, Piasecka attended a conference at the Parliament: *Race, Racism, and Xenophobia in a Global Context Conference*, hosted by MEP Cecile and New York University \(09/11/2017\). 

 In 2018, Vaiya shared Piasecka’s TEDx talk: *Using Theatre to Counter Youth Radicalisation* with Sajjad Karim MEP \[3:2\]. The talk focused on the need to find better and more inclusive ways of delivering the Prevent Duty. In the talk, Piasecka argued that “it is time to change the conversation” when talking about terrorism with young people. 

 <ins>4.3 Impact: European Parliament</ins> 

 Piasecka’s research on Islamophobia and youth radicalisation was instrumental in the convening of an expert conference at the European Parliament to coincide with International Refugee Day. Hosted by Sajiad Karim MEP, the conference was titled: *Promoting Peace, Fighting Youth Radicalization, Fostering a Welcoming Europe* \(21/08/2018\) \[5:1\]. In a concept note to European Parliamentarians to promote the event, Sajjad Karim MEP reiterated Piasecka’s TEDx Talk to ‘change the conversation’ about terrorism: 

 *“Trapped between horrific circumstances and rising intolerance, many who would seek to radicalise find their task simplified. Europe has suffered a series of horrific terror attacks in recent years, which has, in turn, boosted the very rhetoric contributing to that radicalisation. Our previous approaches towards tackling radicalisation have failed, and the results of this failure are becoming more and more apparent. **The time has come to change the conversation**”* \(01/06/18\). \[5:2\] 

-  The expert conference bought together speakers on terrorism and youth radicalisation and included a keynote address from Sir Julian King, British European Commissioner, and expert contributions from Piasecka, Figen Murray \(peace campaigner\), Professor Simon Piasecki \(Liverpool Hope University\) Dr. Ajmal Hussain \(Manchester University\), Estelle Cincinatis \(European Jewish Congress\) and Julie Ward MEP. The importance of the event was underpinned by Sajjad Karim: 

-  *""This conference was about bringing together all sections of society to promote positive engagement against radicalisation and to help foster a welcoming Europe. In this respect, we succeeded… In 15 years of being a Member of Parliament though, I have never been so worried. Xenophobia has been on the rise for many years now and has only been exacerbated by the Brexit vote and a rise in populism across Europe... It means our Member States must remain totally engaged in fighting this rise of extremism and collectively, under the banner of the European Union, our commitments must be strengthened”* \(The Southport Reporter, 2018\). \[5:3\] 

-  The conference was attended by parliamentarians and political journalists, who reported, *“Europe has to stand up and fight for its values if a major crisis is to be averted”* \(22/06/18\). \[5:4\] 

-  Of the immediate significance of the conference and Piasecka’s expert contribution, Kaoutar Abousmir, Head of Parliamentary Office to Sajjad Karim, said: 

 “*I would like to thank you for your valuable contribution to the success of this week's event… Our exchange touched on subjects of great relevance in the current political climate we find ourselves in, and we must use events such as Wednesday’s to continue any momentum gained to help push the issue towards the mainstream of politics, rather than such issues remaining on the periphery. I am confident that we can do so by building on the success of last week’s event*” \(22/06/18\). \[5:5\] 

 The long\-term impact of the case study cannot be easily quantified, given the unstable and shifting political contexts for terrorism, and the subsequent UK exit from the European Union. The aim of the impact case study was not to ‘prevent’ youth radicalisation per se, but rather to highlight issues of concern, in this case surrounding the discriminatory aspects of Prevent and in doing so to help European politicians to identify inclusive and holistic ways of tackling radicalisation and extremism. The significance of the research can be further evidenced in Vaiya’s reflections on Piasecka’s contribution to ARDI: 

 *“Dr Piasecka’s research aligns to our aims and we have adopted her research to inform our work in the EU on combatting terrorism… Dr Piasecka’s pioneering research of anti\-extremist theatre\-in\-education has strengthened our view that polarized thinking about the causes of radicalization leads to marginalized and disaffected communities. In a broader context, her research has enabled policy\-makers to see that there are alternative counter\-terrorism strategies, which are holistic, inclusive and community\-based. We are confident that her contribution will impact on ARDIs priorities for the future”* \(28/11/2019\). \[5:6\] 

 <ins>4.4 Impact: Practitioners</ins> 

 While the main focus has been Piasecka’s work with the European Parliament, her findings have benefited practitioners working in peace activism and anti\-extremist theatre. Robert Marsden, a freelance theatre director and former artistic director of Reveal Theatre, responded to the research, saying: “ *Piasecka’s work ensures that I have a currency in relation to the contemporary debates surrounding Prevent and how theatre and drama is used to explore contentious issues”* \(19/10/20\) \[5:7\]. 

 This view is echoed by Ed Morris, *2engage Performing Arts*. In an interview to discuss the impact of the study, Morris cited the political and social significance of the case study concerning the “ *reductive nature of Prevent\-thinking.”* For Morris, and Goss, *“the case study will impact on the development of future anti\-extremist work for 2engage Performing Arts* \[post school closures due to COVID 19\]” \(19/10/20\). \[5:8\] 

 The most meaningful outcome is evidenced in a testimonial written by the peace\-campaigner Figen Murray. Figen was introduced to Piasecka’s research on Prevent at the European Parliament.  Figen’s son, Martyn Hett, was murdered in the Manchester Arena Bombing. In the years following the attack, Figen has devoted her life to the promotion of peace. She has worked with the EU\-led Radicalisation Network \(RAN\), the Jo Cox Foundation, and is responsible for *Martyn’s Law,* proposed legislation to provide better protection against terrorism for the British public. Figen is a truly inspirational figure and the loss of Martyn illustrates why non\-discriminatory anti\-extremist work matters. Regarding the impact of Piasecka’s research on her work, Figen writes: 

  

 *“I give talks to young people at secondary schools, colleges and universities about the impact of the \[Manchester\] attack on our family. I target young people as I believe they are going to the future educators, policymakers, law makers and parents of the next generation… As a result of \[Piasecka’s research\] I have reflected on my own work with young people. \[It made\] me realise that I need to put more faith and trust in my audiences, and I will include a space for deeper discussion. I usually give a talk and then invite questions about the talk. I realise now that I also could ask the audience certain questions to generate more insight in students”* \(04/11/2019\). \[5:9\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 King’s research, based on the London Air Quality Network \(LAQN\), provided the scientific foundation for a series of environmental policies to improve air quality in London. This included the Congestion Charging scheme and the Low Emission Zone \(LEZ\), which were in force throughout the assessment period, and the Ultra Low Emission Zone \(ULEZ\) from 2019 onwards. King’s provided detailed assessments of air pollution impacts of policy options, allowing the selection and design of the most effective strategies to tackle air pollution in London. The research also quantified the health impacts of air pollution, helping to drive public support for more ambitious policies. This has increased international interest in these methods of pollution control resulting in the adoption of similar interventions across Europe and world\-wide. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Poor air quality is an important public health issue especially in cities where traffic is the major source of pollution. It is estimated that 3.4 million people die prematurely across the world each year \(1.3 million in China, 110,000 in the US and 400,000 in Europe\), because of outdoor air pollution. 

 **Research by King’s quantifies the impacts of air pollutants on health.** Established in 2009, in partnership with three other universities, King’s College London’s Medical Research Council \(MRC\) [ <ins>Centre for Environment and Health</ins>](http://www.environment-health.ac.uk/) was a leading centre for research on air quality and health during the assessment period. King’s established and maintained the  [<ins>London Air Quality Network</ins>](http://www.londonair.org.uk/) \(LAQN\) from 1995 to 2020 \(when the group moved to Imperial College\), and this evolved into the largest urban air quality network in Europe, consisting of over 120 fixed measurement sites for a range of pollutants. King’s research from 2000 onwards used information from the LAQN to understand the sources of atmospheric pollution and to estimate the health impacts of these pollutants. In cities, vehicles are the main contributors to air pollution. King’s research showed that emissions include  [<ins>strong oxidants which damage</ins>](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12883027) the delicate respiratory airways, decreasing airway function and  [<ins>causing inflammation</ins>](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754762). This provided evidence that exposure to transport\-related pollutants is a cause of ill health. 

 **King’s scientists design and evaluate interventions to reduce harmful exposures.** The King’s team conducted research to support the design of traffic control schemes and contribute to their evaluation in order to improve air quality and, hence, health **\(1, 2\)**. King’s developed an air pollution model **\(3\)** that provided highly detailed road\-by\-road traffic emissions estimates **\(2, 4, 5\)**. King’s traffic emissions models are now included in the  [<ins>London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory</ins>](https://data.london.gov.uk/air-quality/) and are used for all air pollution and climate change projects in London. 

 Working in partnership with Transport for London, King’s modelling quantified the  [<ins>expected air quality impact</ins>](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21830496/) of the introduction of a congestion charging scheme \(CCS\). King’s research suggested that the  [<ins>health benefits of the CCS</ins>](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18308748/) introduction might be small and so began to determine the potential benefit of introducing a London\-wide low emission zone \(LEZ\). Prior to activation of the first phase of the LEZ in 2008, King’s research showed that a LEZ could provide improvements in urban air quality, crucially predicting that the emissions controls enforced by the scheme were expected to have the  [<ins>greatest effect</ins>](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22315924) close to major roads with high volumes of heavy\-goods\-vehicle traffic. Research led by King’s quantified the impact of the LEZ on the respiratory health of school children **\(6\)**. King’s researchers were also instrumental in highlighting the acute health responses of pedestrians exposed to traffic pollution in London **\(7\)**, supporting evidence for further tightening of emissions controls via the subsequent ULEZ. 

 **King’s research linked air pollution to a number of public health issues.**. Air pollution data can be combined with public health data to examine correlations with disease. Between 2014 and 2019, the King’s model has been linked to  [<ins>hospital episodes data</ins>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749115300993) \(HES\),  [<ins>primary care electronic health records</ins>](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/9/e022404) \(CPRD\),  [<ins>census</ins>](https://oem.bmj.com/content/65/9/620.long),  [<ins>cohort</ins>](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/effect-of-exhaust-and-nonexhaustrelated-components-of-particulate-matter-on-longterm-survival-after-stroke(cc12bd24-6a60-46ac-97fa-5fa5dd407d48).html) and  [<ins>registry data</ins>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019314734?via%3Dihub) in multiple research publications to investigate associations with cardiovascular, respiratory, cognitive, neurological, perinatal and post\-natal morbidity and mortality. The King’s model is also being developed to track individual exposure to air pollution **\(4\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 King’s air quality research had impact from 2013 to 2020 by contributing to the design, implementation and evaluation of traffic control schemes in the UK, including impact on air quality and health outcomes, and providing scientific advice on air quality to inform the development of schemes internationally. The ultimate beneficiaries from the research include the populations of urban centres world\-wide, especially the most heavily exposed in deprived areas, that have directly benefited from control measures directed at reducing traffic\-related air pollution. King’s research has directly benefitted and influenced stakeholders in transport policy nationally and internationally including politicians, policy\-makers, planners and managers, as well as service users. 

 **King’s research influences air quality strategy in London.** In 2018, the Mayor of London published the London Environment Strategy \(LES\) **\(A\)**, setting out details of policy actions to improve the city’s air quality and the health and wellbeing of its residents. King’s research was used in the LES to assess the impacts on pollutant concentrations of a range of policies including the new Ultra Low Emissions Zone \(ULEZ\) **\(B\)**. King’s research calculated both the traffic emissions and air quality predictions of policy interventions from 2013 onwards and to future years to 2030. The LES includes plans for the London Taxi and Bus strategies, the Central London ULEZ, the London Wide HGV/Bus strategy, and the Inner London ULEZ zone for the area bounded by the North and South Circular roads **\(A\)**. 

 The underpinning research from King’s led to the ambitious ULEZ. As with the preceding LEZ, King’s LAQN provided data to underpin the strategy through the monitoring of air quality and emissions. The LAQN index, developed by King’s, is used throughout the London Mayor’s report to ‘provide a picture of the overall improvements in London’s air quality’ **\(A.1\)**. The London Air Quality Network web\-site not only informs Transport for London, but can be used by the public to find interactive street\-level current pollution maps; incidences of high pollution episodes; interactive graphs by London borough and yearly reports. This innovative research, linked to policy, has informed the development of similar schemes throughout the UK, such as the Breathe London network, which can be used to highlight potential air quality hotspots, allowing solutions to be put in place as quickly as possible **\(C.1\)**. Internationally this work was propagated via the  [<ins>C40 Cities</ins>](https://www.c40.org/) new Air Quality Network launched in 2018. It focused on helping cities develop and implement air quality policies and solutions to reduce air pollution, improve public health and meet climate goals **\(C.2\)**. The team running the LAQN was assigned ‘essential worker’ status during the COVID\-19 pandemic and maintained the flow of essential information to the public and government agencies **\(D.1\)**. This service was acknowledged in writing by the Mayor of London **\(D.2\)**: “The data collected through the air quality monitoring network is extremely important to the ongoing evaluation of risk during the COVID\-19 pandemic. This is especially true in light of the emerging evidence of an association between exposure to air pollution and the most severe effects of COVID\-19. The research your team submitted as part of the Air Quality Expert Group call for evidence shed valuable light on the immediate impact of the lockdown on London’s air quality \(…\) Over the years you and the team have contributed hugely to our understanding of the impact air pollution is having on the health of Londoners”. 

 **King’s academics provide expert advice and advocacy to UK policy\-makers.** This work was extended in 2016, in collaboration with Policy Exchange, a leading think tank based in London. It resulted in two reports on air pollution in London that considered the moral, legal and economic case for doing more to tackle air pollution. The reports showed that despite the growing focus on the issue in recent years, current and planned policies are unlikely to deliver compliance with air quality limits in London until at least 2025. The reports outline the health and economic benefits of taking further steps to tackle air pollution **\(E.1, E.2\)**. The work tested additional policy scenarios policies with European, UK and London\-wide scales. Model predictions covered future years \(2020/5\) and included testing the impacts of tightening enforcement of Euro 6 vehicle emission controls, reversing the diesel/petrol mix, reducing diesel numbers, increasing diesel taxation, introducing a diesel scrappage scheme, applying the ULEZ scheme including the taxi and bus strategies, encouraging electric and hybrid electric vehicles, tackling high emitting boilers and reducing the impact of new Combined Heat and Power \(CHP\) boilers. **\(E. 2\)** A ten\-point plan was produced and was used as evidence at the London Assembly Environment Committee on compliance with legal air quality standards **\(E.3\)**. The Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs \(Defra\) commissioned a  [<ins>similar policy assessment</ins>](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanplh/PIIS2542-5196(18)30067-6.pdf) for the whole of the UK forward to 2050, which informed the UK Government’s Clean Air Strategy 2018 **\(F\)**, including climate change policies. A key recommendation introduced by this strategy was a new commitment to progressively cut public exposure to particulate matter pollution, halving the population living in areas with concentrations of fine particulate matter above WHO guideline levels \(10 μg/m3\) by 2025 **\(F, Chapter 2, p.4\)**. 

 In 2019, Professor Martin Williams was appointed as the UK’s first Clean Air Champion \(shared role\) to spearhead the Clean Air Programme, which aims to develop solutions towards a cleaner economy **\(G\)**. Professor Frank Kelly gave expert advice to the European Respiratory Society Environment & Health Committee in 2019 **\(H.1\)** and the Future Cites Catapult in 2018 **\(H.2\)**, as well as evidence to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee in 2016 **\(I\)**. King’s researchers have also compiled reports for DEFRA and other Government agencies including a review of air quality modelling **\(J\)**. Multiple local authorities in the UK are now planning and implementing LEZs including  [<ins>Bath, Birmingham, Bristol, Bradford, Greater Manchester, Leicester, Newcastle, Oxford, Portsmouth and Sheffield</ins>](https://www.bvrla.co.uk/resource/cazmap.html). This activity is also reflected by King’s researchers’ memberships of several important and influential government groups, such as the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, the expert advisory group of the Department of Health in the UK for which Kelly has been Chair \(2011\-2020\) **\(K.1\)**; Quantification of air pollution health effects, a sub\-group of COMEAP \(2017\-2020\) **\(K.2\)**; and the Air Quality Expert Group, the DEFRA advisory group \(2013\-2020\) **\(K.3\)**. 

 **King’s scientists provide expert advice to international agencies.** King’s expertise in air quality management and linking air pollution with health outcomes is widely recognised on the International stage. King’s collaborated with international researchers to provide expert advice to policy makers in Paris, Beijing and Hong Kong **\(L\)**. King’s researchers have played significant roles in the air quality review process initiated by the WHO; in 2015, Professor Williams gave expert advice and co\-chaired a WHO expert consultation meeting on the future update of the WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines **\(M\)**. This eventually led him to co\-chair the WHO Air Quality Guidelines Development Group in 2018 **\(M\)**. The consultation identified 32 ambient air pollutants that can pose health hazards to human populations and should be carefully followed by WHO and monitored by countries worldwide, but there was consensus that immediate priorities were particulate matter \(PM\), ozone \(O3\), nitrogen dioxide \(NO2\), sulphur dioxide \(SO2\), and carbon monoxide \(CO\)’ **\(M, pp27\-8\)**. King’s staff were also members and consultants of influential national and international scientific panels including: the UN Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution \(2018\) **\(N.1\)**; and the US Health Effects Institute Review Board and their investigation into the Health Effects of Traffic pollution \(2018\) **\(N.2\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Interdisciplinary research undertaken by **Blundel**, **Schaefer** and **Wahga** at The Open University has addressed the challenge of improving firm\-level environmental performance in small and medium\-sized enterprises \(SMEs\), with a focus on the role played by intermediaries in promoting the adoption of more sustainable processes, technologies and policies. Outputs from this research have influenced professional practice in intermediary organisations and generated evidence\-based tools and learning resources that are facilitating more effective, values\-based engagement with SME owners and managers. The research has also shaped the design of curriculum in HEIs and related student learning experiences in the UK and Pakistan. Impacts have been achieved through: focused interactions with SME owners and managers; collaborative engagement with intermediaries and policymakers; and co\-creation of accredited modules and open educational resources. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 There is a need for small and medium sized enterprises \(SMEs\) to improve their environmental awareness, capability development and performance. Smaller firms have a significant environmental footprint but tend to have fewer resources and are less well\-regulated in comparison to larger firms **\[O1, O2\]**. The research undertaken by **Blundel**, **Schaefer** and **Wahga** \(2009 \- 2018\) has examined these three elements with a specific focus on the catalytic role of intermediaries, such as business advisors, working with \(and in some cases, within\) businesses to promote such changes. They analysed the strengths and weaknesses of dominant policy discourses that seek to promote SME development, pro\-environmental innovations and changes in practice **\[O1, O4\]**; they also challenged the application of exclusively economic, ‘win\-win’ arguments in these contexts **\[O2, O5\]**. The following research outcomes from this body of work contributed to the impacts reported in this case: 

-  Identified key relational and qualitative dimensions of the growth process in small and medium\-sized organisations **\[O3\]**: the *relational* focus \(i.e. the influence of other network actors on firm\-level capabilities and growth\), has informed work on intermediary organisations and SMEs, particularly in relation to longer\-term transitions **\[O1, O4, O6\]**; the *qualitative* focus \(i.e. beyond purely economic goals and success criteria\), has highlighted the importance of personal, professional and organisational values, and the role that values\-based approaches can play in facilitating more effective engagement with SME owners and managers **\[O2, O5\]**. 

-  Highlighted weaknesses in dominant policy discourses that seek to promote environmental innovations and practice changes in SMEs **\[O1, O4\]**; in particular, how over\-reliance on economic, ‘win\-win’ arguments can result in superficial forms of engagement and limited change in firm\-level environmental practices **\[O2, O5\]**. 

-  Argued that short\-term pro\-environmental action by SMEs, based around existing ways of operating, needs to be complemented by longer\-term strategic reorientation towards a more environmentally and socially sustainable growth trajectory **\[O1, O3, O5\]**. 

-  Demonstrated that values\-based engagement is an effective but currently under\-exploited complement to prevailing ‘hard’ approaches to environmental improvement, which focus on technical aspects of new products and practices \(e.g. energy efficiency data\), and on economic justifications \(e.g. availability of subsidies, anticipated payback periods\) **\[O2, O5\]**. 

-  Showed how intermediary organisations can drive environmental performance improvement in developing country contexts by providing SMEs with the micro\-foundations of capability development and compensating for limitations in governmental agency \(i.e. a ‘proto\-institutional’ role\) **\[O6\]**, and by incorporating values\-based approaches into their SME engagement strategies **\[O2\]**. 

 These insights contributed to the impacts detailed in Section 5 through the UK\-based research team’s engagement initiatives with intermediary organisations in Pakistan’s leather industry sector and the creation of an innovative online course and toolkit for business advisors, “Promoting Sustainability in Business”, which was piloted in both countries **\[C10\]**. Much of the underpinning research has been conducted by academics in the Open University Business School’s **Social and Sustainable Enterprise \(SSE\)** research cluster. The doctoral programme has also played a key role in achieving impact, as several former PhD students, including Williams and **Wahga**, have contributed to the research and engagement activity through post\-doctoral fellowships and externally\-funded appointments.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact has been generated by bringing together a series of distinct yet closely inter\-connected research projects, which have addressed SME environmental performance, green innovation and the provision of business support services. The outputs from these research projects have influenced professional practice and generated evidence\-based tools and learning resources that have helped SME owners, managers and intermediaries to adopt more environmentally and socially sustainable practices, while also embedding sustainability imperatives into their longer\-term growth trajectories. Initial work on the cited projects commenced in 2009 with the most significant impacts occurring since 2017. 

 <ins> **The research has informed changes to practice by leading business support organisations in Pakistan**</ins> 

 Research by **Wahga**, **Blundel** and **Schaefer** on promoting environmental responsibility amongst SMEs in Pakistan’s leather manufacturing industry **\[O6\]** builds on earlier work on SME policy, business development, and provision of business support services in developing countries **\[O1, O4\]**. Findings and policy recommendations have been adopted by staff at SMEDA, Pakistan’s national small business support organisation and primary SME policy\-advisory body, who confirmed that: “ *Following the policy framework proposed in **Wahga’s** papers during the trainings that I offer, I* *now advise SMEs how to more effectively engage with environmental issues, for example thorough collaborative investments and environmental learning. Through this, we have inculcated environmental values in a number of new small businesses*” **\[C1a\]**. The OU team also secured Best Paper awards at SMEDA’s International SME Conferences in Lahore 2017 and 2018, the only event of its kind in Pakistan. In 2018 it attracted more than 600 participants from national government departments, international development agencies \(such as JICA\), financial institutions, large scale enterprises, and international SME representative bodies from developed and developing countries, including Bulgaria, China, Japan, South Korea, and the USA **\[C1b, C1c\]**. 

 They have influenced policy and practice in this sector through direct engagement with the three major non\-governmental agencies active in the leather industry \- the Cleaner Production Centres \(CPC\) network, the Pakistan Tanners Association \(PTA\), and WWF\-Pakistan, the national office of this leading global conservation organisation. The Project Manager for the CPC described the impact of reading and engaging with the OU research in these terms: “ *As a policy matter, we have therefore changed our focus of intervention in the industry. Your research has guided and enabled us to establish a network of firms based on their environmental behaviour \[…\] It has had a great impact on our way of approaching SMEs and encouraging them to become eco\-friendly business*” **\[C3a\]**. Further impact on WWF\-Pakistan, which was enhanced through the online course and toolkit, is detailed in the next section. 

 <ins> **The</ins> <ins>research was applied to co\-create an online course and toolkit that has enhanced the understanding and capabilities of individuals and organisations engaged in climate change mitigation</ins> <ins>and sustainability initiatives**</ins> 

 The OU team combined their research \(SME growth processes, SME owner\-managers’ values and small business support organisations\), with specialist contributions from external partners \(The Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford and Europe’s leading climate communications consultancy, Climate Outreach\) in an ESRC\-funded initiative, ‘Growing Greener’ \(2017\-19\): http://business\-school.open.ac.uk/research/growing\-greener. They engaged with SME owner\-managers and business advisors to co\-create an innovative open access online course, ‘Promoting Sustainability in Business: A Values\-Based Toolkit’, which is hosted on the Open University’s ‘OpenLearn Create’ platform **\[C4\]**. 

 This initiative has expanded the capabilities of their partners, Climate Outreach in engaging with SMEs and business advisors. The Executive Director has commented: “ *The project has given Climate Outreach experience in working with audiences and sectors that present unique challenges for climate and sustainability communicators. Understanding how to build a values\-based engagement strategy with actors and intermediaries who are having to balance sustainability with other more instrumental priorities has provided Climate Outreach with invaluable learnings and experiences which have improved and strengthened the methodologies we use to conduct research and outreach”* **\[C6\]**. 

 Since its launch in February 2019, more than 900 people have engaged with the online course **\[C4\]** and monitoring evidence indicates that it has helped both individuals and organisations to engage their SME clients more effectively in relation to climate change mitigation and other important environmental issues **\[C5, C6, C7, C8, C9\]**. For example, a senior manager at international user experience \(UX\) design consultancy Akendi noted that: “ *This \[course and toolkit\] has accelerated our understanding of the problem space of SME engagement with sustainability and helped us form opinions about viable next steps in our project*” **\[C9b\]**. A programme manager at Bioregional, creators of the ‘One Planet Living’ framework, said: “ *We make considerable use values\-based engagement in our work with SMEs and start\-up ventures and recognise the importance of tailoring our approach so that it fits with the values and priorities of our clients. The online course and toolkit provide useful insights which help to inform our work with businesses”* **\[C9c\]**. The Business Relationship Manager at Low Carbon Hub, a leading social enterprise working to transform the energy system, also recognised the value of these resources: “ *It means that more advisors like me can learn about how a values\-based approach can help develop more meaningful, longer term relationships with SMEs, in turn helping to set more businesses on their way towards sustainability*” **\[C9d\]**. 

 **Blundel** and **Wahga** also influenced practitioners by piloting a training workshop, which combined the online course and face\-to\-face sessions, with 15 business advisors at WWF\-Pakistan and 20 graduate students \(primarily experienced professionals and nascent entrepreneurs\) at GCU, Lahore, one of the oldest and most prestigious seats of learning in Pakistan **\[C5\]**. WWF\-Pakistan has improved its routines and practices to support SMEs more effectively by making use of guidance from the course and specific insights from their research on environmental stewardship in leather and textile industry **\[O6\]**. For example, having attended the workshop, the organisation’s Regional Coordinator, Freshwater stated that: *“\[A\] major change in our practice has been that when working with firms we now identify those entrepreneurs having more active environmental values and network them with those who focus less on environmental improvement. We believe by doing so we have started to promote environmental improvement agenda in the Pakistani industries more effectively \[…\] we offer training to the staff of SMEs about Smart Environmental Management Practices, now through a more integrated approach using effective communication tools learnt during the \[workshop\]*” **\[C3b\]**. A GCU graduate student and hotel owner added: “ *\[I\]nformed by your work we have changed a number of practices at our hotel \[…\] We are doing our best to change the concept of traditional tourism to sustainable tourism by promoting environmental values amongst our guests and hotel owners. Moreover, I have led the making of a consortium of hotel owners who regularly meet and discuss possible measures to save water and reduce energy consumption*” **\[C3c\]**. 

 The values\-based approach to engagement, which is promoted through this course and toolkit, has informed policy\-making and practitioner audiences in various ways, including: inclusion in a policy briefing on ‘Eco\-Innovation in SMEs’, published by the European Commission’s Directorate\-General Environment in 2019 **\[C11**, pp. 30\-31; 45; 50 **\]**; a briefing for 15 business advisors \(energy\-related\) at the UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) **\[C7\]**; and a presentation at ‘Sustainable Built Environment 2019’, a conference attended by more than 200 built environment professionals, policy experts and government officials, which has also been made available as an open access publication **\[C12\]**. 

 <ins> **The research has enabled new learning experiences for undergraduate and postgraduate students at The Open University and in other institutions**</ins> 

 Their body of research on improving the environmental performance of SMEs **\[O1, O2, O5, O6\]** has been incorporated into the formal higher education curriculum, via case material, audio visual assets and learning activities, in the OU undergraduate modules, *B327 Creating Futures: “Sustainable Enterprise and Innovation* \(approximately 400 students since 2017\), and *B205 Exploring Innovation and Entrepreneurship*” \(more than 400 students since 2016\) **\[C10\]**. Related qualitative feedback from students on these courses includes: “ *I was really inspired by this module. The different projects undertaken throughout the module have motivated me to achieve sustainable enterprises at work and in personal life.*” \(B327, 2018 cohort\) **\[C10**, p.115 **\]**; “ *It is a full\-on, grown\-up course and not to be taken lightly. \[…\] It has also given me some useful tools which I have already used in my working life.*” \(B205, 2017 cohort\) **\[C10**, p.113 **\]**. 

 This research has also influenced the curriculum at GCU Lahore, including the decision to launch a new postgraduate course on environmental entrepreneurship in 2020, and key aspects of the curriculum, which incorporate outputs from this research **\[O6\]**. Since 2018, it has also encouraged MS \(MPhil level\) Entrepreneurship and SME Management students \(cohort of 15\-20 students per year, most of whom are also business owners and professional practitioners\) to examine environmental practices of SMEs in various industry sectors in Pakistan **\[C2\]**. The Programme Coordinator at GCU commented: “ *We have included your papers as readings in our courses \[and\] a number of entrepreneurship students have also received motivation to undertake research on green businesses in the country \[…\] one of our students is researching responsible tourism business in Northern areas of Pakistan, another one is focusing on environmentally sustainable practices in private and public sector hospitals, and yet one more is interested in the adoption of green technologies in early\-stage micro and small businesses*” **\[C2\]**. 

 Work on these projects has been further developed during 2020, in spite of constraints imposed by the Covid\-19 epidemic, with future impact planned through engagement with policymakers and intermediaries in Pakistan’s textiles sector.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted at the University of Aberdeen has contributed new algorithms and protocols, measurement analysis, and architectural design to Internet Standards published by the Internet Engineering Task Force \(IETF\). Since 2015, the research team has published 11 specifications in the Requests for Comments \(RFC\) series. These are the key working documents underpinning the Internet, which have been and are being implemented by the networking industry, informing the current practice of Internet operators. Fairhurst’s RFCs are now deployed globally in products from companies such as Google and Apple.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2020, the Internet supports over 4,500,000,000 users worldwide. The day\-to\-day operation of the Internet depends on voluntary adherence of vendors and operators to standard protocols and procedures specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force \(IETF\).  Research in Internet Engineering at the University of Aberdeen led by Prof. Gorry Fairhurst and the wider team \(Dr Raffaello Secchi and Research Assistants Tom Jones and Ana Custura\), has focussed on addressing key Internet Engineering challenges and played a fundamental role in enhancing the efficiency of Internet systems through collaborations in projects \[P1\-P7\] with partners across the EU. Their work spans the design of Internet equipment, measurement of Internet infrastructure, to the design of the protocols that control data transport across Internet paths. 

 **Evolving the Internet Transport System and defining a new Transport Interface** **\[P3\] \[P4\]** 

 Working with key industry partners including Mozilla, CISCO and Celerway, research led by Fairhurst \[P3\] underpinned the design of a new architecture for the transport system. \[1\] This addressed two key obstacles faced by Internet innovators by 1\) lowering the barrier to application development through a new open transport system, that allows developers to automatically select a suitable protocol for an Internet application and to specify the options required; and 2\) providing an architectural change where new transport services can seamlessly be integrated. The new approach introduced by Fairhurst, decouples the transport service from the design of the underlying transport protocol. This eliminates previous obstacles to deploying new methods, enabling evolution within the transport system, and allowing developers to benefit from new methods wherever they become available. The NEAT Project \[P3\] proposed a new system architecture and contributed this to the IETF. An Open Source research implementation demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. \[1\] Fairhurst and his team implemented the Datagram subsystem, and then defined the interaction with the network layer \[P4\], resulting in further standards contributions. 

 **Reducing End\-to\-End Internet Latency across the Internet Path \[P2\]** 

 Between 2012 and 2015, research in the interaction of transport and network protocols by Fairhurst, \[P2\] performed an in\-depth analysis of the end\-to\-end delay experienced by Internet users. \[2\] This work brought Internet latency to the fore as an important performance metric. Latency measures the time needed to transport packets across the network, which ultimately impacts download speed and responsiveness of time critical communications. 

 In collaboration with industry partners, Fairhurst and Secchi explored the performance of Active Queue Management \(AQM\) methods and showed these can significantly reduce latency, without requiring investment in higher speed communications links. \[2\] Explicit Congestion Notification \(ECN\) methods were defined that enable a router to better control the latency it introduces, resulting in the design of a new congestion control algorithm, TCP Alternative Backoff with ECN \(ABE\). \[3\] Presentation of this method won the Best Paper Prize at IFIP Networking, 2017, and was contributed to the IETF \(RFC8511\). 

 **Determining Appropriate Sending Behaviour for Internet Datagrams \[P1\-P4\] \[P6\-P7\]** 

 From 2015\-2018, and building on research around the User Datagram Protocol \(UDP\), \[P1\] Fairhurst explored the impact of the industry move towards UDP transport \[P4\] by focusing on how network operators balance operational needs and user privacy concerns, to understand the implications of encryption on manageability of network traffic \($1\) resulting in contributions to the IETF transport working group \[$2\]. 

 Fairhurst and his team designed new research tools enabling large\-scale Internet measurement of \[P4\]. These were used to examine and report the path transparency of transport protocol headers in the mobile and wired Internet \(e.g., \[4\-6\]\). Employing these tools new large\-scale measurements by Fairhurst’s team provided “ *invaluable engineering reality checks*”, \[$3\] needed to progress UDP specifications and for the IETF to select codepoints, which are used by routers and switches to give traffic priority levels, and for the lower\-effort service designed to support safe background download of software updates and data. \[$3\] Fairhurst built on earlier experience from research exploring a less than best effort Internet service for rural inclusion \[P1\]. 

 In 2018, following analysis of path failure due to packet size \[P3\] \[5\], Fairhurst and his team worked with the University of Muenster to co\-design a new technique, Datagram Packetization Layer PMTU Discovery, DPLPMTUD. This can automatically determine when it is safe to increase the size of packet being used, which allows a sender to detect a black hole and reduce the packet size \(when current methods could fail by using full\-sized packets \[5\]\). DPLPMTUD successfully avoids packet size black holes for 99.72% of tested IPv4 Internet paths. Using larger packets can reduce the packet rate by 17%, for 96% of paths, compared to using a default size of 1280B. Operating at the transport layer, the new technique supports all current protocols, including transport methods that use encryption. 

 As part of an on\-going project, initiated in 2018, Fairhurst and his team, funded by the European Space Agency \(ESA\) \[P6\] \[P7\] analysed QUIC, an encrypted UDP transport, originally proposed by Google to accelerate web sessions. This research proposed changes to the QUIC acknowledgment strategy, \[7\] and use of ECN. These and other topics were proposed by Fairhurst and his team as ways to ensure acceptable performance of the emerging IETF QUIC protocol over broadband satellite systems.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The IETF is the primary Internet Standards Development Organisation \(SDO\). Its mission is to make the Internet work better by producing high quality relevant technical documents that influence the way people design, use, and manage the Internet. An open standards policy combines contributions from industry \(such as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Ericsson\), network operators \(such as BT, Google, Akamai\), leading research institutions \(as in this case study\) and other stakeholders, to provide the technical and operational expertise required to develop standards and industry Best Current Practice \(BCP\). BCP documents are published in the Request For Comments \(RFC\) series and can be accessed online from  [www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs](http://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs). Fairhurst chairs the Transport area working group \(TSVWG\) and has co\-authored 11 RFCs across the Internet and Transport areas since 2014 \(total 273 pages\), totalling 28 since 2002 \(with 183 citations in other RFCs\) \[$2\]. 

 RFC specifications are crucial to the day\-to\-day running and expansion of the Internet.  Although the commercial gain yielded by such open standards is not measurable, these standards are widely used at all stages in Internet service delivery: by networking equipment designers, by network and service operators, in data centres and as a basis for enterprise. RFCs are also used as the basis for government procurement of equipment and services, and underpin other standardisation, including cellular mobile standards for 5G technology. 

 **Evolving the Internet Transport System and defining a new Transport Interface \[P3\] \[P4\]** 

 **Specifications:** *RFC8095; RFC8304.* 

 Research by Fairhurst directly contributed to formation of the IETF Transport and Services \(TAPS\) standards working group in 2014 \[$6\]. Work contributed by NEAT \[P3\] underpinned standards work that unifies the interface between the Internet transport system and applications \[$7\]. In 2015, Fairhurst and Welzl \(University of Oslo\) were invited to present this work at the Internet Architecture Board SEMI Workshop, which set future directions for a series of IETF standards. Fairhurst’s research provided an “ *important first step*” \[$6\] and has continued to be a “ *key contributor*” to the TAPS architectural framework \[$7\] \(as a contributor to the first 3 published documents and a co\-author of RFC8095 and RFC8304\). He is a co\-author of two further working group standardisation documents \[$6\]. 

 Operating system developers, such as Apple Computer, \[$7\] can immediately benefit from the new TAPS specifications. An Internet Technologies Engineer at Apple stated, “ *In 2018, Apple released Network.framework at the World Wide Developer Conference… The architecture produced by the TAPS working group deeply informed the development of this framework. Since its release, many applications have adopted this framework on iOS and macOS*” \[$7\]. This has provided developers with a common secure framework across different platforms, enabling each application to automatically tune the transport system to the current network conditions. The new interface also simplifies development of applications and products. In another example, Celerway Communications is using the automated methods defined by TAPS to enhance the proxy functionality in its software to boost the throughput of mobile applications \[$4\]. 

 **Reducing End\-to\-End Internet Latency across the Internet Path \[P2\]** 

 **Specifications:** *RFC7567; RFC8087; RFC8511.* 

 Research led by Fairhurst and Secchi in AQM techniques \[P2\] underpinned an Internet BCP in 2015, RFC7567, co\-authored by F. Baker \(Cisco\) and Fairhurst. \[$3\] Operators are benefitting from this BCP when configuring AQM routers to meet the demands of new low\-latency Internet applications. This was followed by RFC8087, identifying the additional benefits of using ECN with AQM \(co\-authored by Fairhurst and Welzl\). Both AQM and ECN techniques are important in reaching the demanding latency targets of 5G mobile networks, which the GSM Association predicts will be up to 50 times lower than networks using 4G. 

 Fairhurst and his research team collaborated with the University of Oslo and Netflix to develop a standard based on their ABE method, \[4\] published as RFC8511 \[$2\]. In 2018, Fairhurst and Secchi continued to contribute to the next generation ECN techniques being standardized in the IETF as L4S \(Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput\) \[$9\]. Fairhurst also served on the scientific advisory board of the Swedish READY \(Research Environment for Advancing Low Latency Internet\) Project, which applied Internet techniques \(including ECN\) to a range of industry problems. 

 **Determining Appropriate Sending Behaviour for Internet Datagrams \[P1\-P4\] \[P6\-P7\]** 

 **Specifications:** *RFC8085; RFC8084; RFC8899.* 

 Internet Engineering research resulted in new transport methods and guidelines for Internet Best Current Practice for application and protocol designers. This includes co\-authoring guidelines for using UDP as an Internet Transport, RFC8085. This is BCP148 \(replacing RFC5405, its predecessor, also co\-authored by Fairhurst and cited by 59 RFCs \[$2\]\). 

 There is a growing volume of encrypted UDP Internet traffic, as a result of increased concern about privacy and a desire for a faster pace of protocol evolution. This has required the Internet community to consider the implications of pervasive encryption. Fairhurst \(with a team from ETH, Zurich and Vijay Gurbani, USA\) organised an industry summit to bring together key researchers, Internet engineers and network equipment vendors from across the world, to examine how to meet the challenges posed by encrypted traffic, resulting in an industry whitepaper \[$1\]. Current IETF standards work \(co\-authored by Fairhurst\) will articulate these challenges in an informational document \[$9\] describing Transport Header Confidentiality, Network Operations, and the Evolution of Internet Transport Protocols \[$2\]. 

 Research results by Fairhurst and his team provided “ *careful and insightful input*” in the standardization of RFC8210, a core IPv6 specification. \[$8\] The research provided a “ *key input to the development*” \[$7\] of a new standard: DPLPMTUD, RFC8899. This makes a significant design change that allows developers of transport systems to avoid reliance on network\-layer fragmentation and enables an application to safely increase the size of packets that it sends \[$8\]. Development within the FreeBSD Project \[$10\] added DPLPMTUD to the Stream Control Transport Protocol \(SCTP\), a core transport protocol used in cellular mobile Internet \[$5\]. 

 Based on research \[P3\] and \[P6\], Fairhurst worked within the standards process to contribute to the design for IETF QUIC, and proposed and analysed extensions \[P7\] to the standard. The IETF QUIC standard includes DPLPMTUD, normatively referencing RFC8899 \[$5\]. QUIC is expected to have significant take\-up by companies, and is already 35% of Google's traffic in April 2020, and a growing component of total Internet traffic \(about 7%\), expected to increase as companies add support to their products after IETF standardisation in 2021.

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Effective use of digital channels can increase the viability of High Street businesses accustomed to trading only from physical premises. Research by Dr Fiona Ellis\-Chadwick has underpinned methods for measuring the extent and economic significance of digital channel adoption by businesses located in any given area. This work helped meet a recommendation of the UK government’s 2015 *Digital High Street 2020 Report* through the creation of a Digital High Street Health Index, a tool to assess the online skills and activity of High Street retail businesses. It also shaped a 2018 nationwide training guide produced by Nominet, the organisation responsible for managing all the UK’s internet domains, thus enabling more businesses to get online. Further, it has increased digital activity and skills among thousands of retail businesses in Leicestershire and Warwickshire – along with local authority support for such a shift – since 2017.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Many businesses in the UK are underperforming and missing trading opportunities due to lack of suitable deployment of online channels. To understand and address this problem, Ellis\-Chadwick’s body of research over the past 20 years has studied internet adoption as a channel to market for UK retailers and explored how businesses have – or have not – used internet technologies to develop strategic advantage and enhance trade. 

 This research has identified many issues central to business and town\-centre development and sustainability. Ellis\-Chadwick captured the early tentative steps by retail businesses to get online, as well as subsequent developments, offering insights into how early experiments with digital channels became the global commercial phenomena we know today. 

 Her research early in this century assessed the uptake, and types and predictors of internet use by retail organisations **\[R2, R3\].** Of those that had developed a website, the majority were then using it primarily as a communication tool to promote corporate or product information to internet users, rather than to support direct sales. The importance of developing a coherent and integrated internet strategy, the need for senior management commitment, and the presence of an appropriate infrastructure and development capability were identified. 

 Ellis\-Chadwick’s work subsequently expanded to examine the maturity and sophistication of digital technology use by retailers. For example, having initially captured insights about the potential of internet technologies for businesses **\[R2, R3\]**, the research began to focus on the strategic adoption of such technologies and how they could drive business success **\[R4, R5\]**. This enabled a detailed understanding of factors \(such as the human and material resources required\) that allow retailers to adopt online as an effective channel to market for sales, communications and relationship development. It also highlighted barriers, such as tensions between online and offline trading and the very patchy use of performance measurement in retailers’ internet operations. **R1** demonstrated that as the scale and scope of a retailer's e\-commerce operations grew, there was a concomitant need for its e\-service quality operations to develop, if it was to realise the full value from its online activities. 

 The research **\[R4, R6\]** also highlighted significant gaps between the skill sets of large and small businesses, with the latter significantly lagging. Moreover, the status of the digital economy in the retail sector was shown to be weak, with less than 20% of businesses trading online in some areas. The implications for local economies and their ability to survive going forward are significant. 

 Collectively, Ellis\-Chadwick’s research outputs paved the way for an innovative methodology to analyse business populations with precision. Having built up a detailed knowledge of the nature, drivers, and service quality issues of online retail activity \( **R6** summarised some of this\), it became possible to assess the status of the digital economy at a town or city level, and thus to identify ways to improve local digital economy performance.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In 2014, the then Department of Communities and Local Government \(DCLG\) identified the potential of Ellis\-Chadwick’s research and invited her to join the department’s strategic advisory group/steering committee as research lead. Committee involvement enabled Ellis\-Chadwick to collaborate with industry leaders across retail, finance, technology and transport sectors. In doing so, she was able to inform their thinking about the value of data and how this could better provide insights into the performance of the digital economy. This led to the impacts detailed below. 

 *• **Helped DCLG meet a key recommendation of the government’s Digital High Street 2020 report** 

 In March 2015 the Digital High Street Advisory Board, working under the auspices of DCLG, published its *Digital High Street 2020 Report*. It recommended the creation of a Digital High Street Health Index to fill a gap in knowledge: baseline analysis of existing business performance in the digital economy. DCLG invited Ellis\-Chadwick to produce the necessary measurement methodology, based on her research. 

 The DCLG policy official working with the steering group at the time commented in 2020: “Ellis\-Chadwick’s extensive research, which identified many of the key indicators of successful online retailing, enabled her to take the lead in specifying and developing the Digital High Street Index, thus meeting the fourth recommendation of the report.” **\[S1\]**. The principal consultant to the Digital High Street Advisory Board commented in the same year: “The Index benefits local place managers, regeneration teams and development officers by providing an evidence base when planning investments in digital technologies and business training in their area.” **\[S2\]** 

 Ellis\-Chadwick’s work also benefited DCLG staff and operations by increasing knowledge of and communication about digital skills for local businesses. The DCLG policy official stated that in 2017 Ellis\-Chadwick “co\-led two workshops for in total about 300 DCLG staff, which enabled them better to understand the nature of digital skills and how businesses can use them” **\[S1\]**. Ellis\-Chadwick also participated in 10 DCLG roadshows for local government and businesses over the course of 2016, 2017 and 2018 **\[S1\]**. 

 *• **Shaped and targeted training for ‘disconnected’ business across the UK** 

 Since 1996 Nominet has been the official UK domain registration body, responsible for registering all domain names of the forms .co.uk, .org.uk, .uk and .me.uk. Ellis\-Chadwick worked with Nominet on its data sets during the development of the Digital High Street Health Index. 

 Having identified many businesses with no internet domain registrations, Ellis\-Chadwick encouraged Nominet to develop a 2018 training guide to help ‘disconnected’ business on UK High Streets – approximately 30% of all retailers – take the first steps towards getting online. Nearly 10,000 copies of the guide, entitled *Why your business needs to have a website and four easy steps to getting started*, were distributed to businesses, Local Enterprise Partnerships \(LEPs\), libraries and other outlets, and a revised version remains available from Nominet online and from smallbusiness.co.uk **\[S3\]**. It had been downloaded nearly 5,500 times by December 2020 **\[S4\].** 

 In 2020 the former Head of Marketing at Nominet stated: “\[Ellis\-Chadwick\] enabled us to identify the numbers and types of retail business across the UK that are less likely to have a website and be properly online. This assisted in our targeting of who we should provide the benefits of being online and who we could help get online... The insights she and her research contributed have been an important element of national attempts to keep High Street businesses viable.” **\[S4\]** 

 *• **Increased digital activity and skills among thousands of retail businesses in two counties** 

 Working with DCLG and LEPs across Leicestershire and Warwickshire, Ellis\-Chadwick led a large\-scale project over a 4\-year period in 26 market towns, involving around 10,000 businesses. This produced baseline evidence on levels of digital activity uptake and a means of measuring improvements over time. 

 The annual Digital High Street Health Index reports influenced strategic development plans for digital growth among High Street businesses in these counties. It also informed the content and targeting of business training, especially among SMEs, where use of the Index identified major deficiencies. The Index has shown year\-on\-year gains in uptake, development and sophistication of online provision and a reduction in the number of disconnected businesses. 

 <ins> *Leicestershire*</ins> 

 Leicestershire County Council’s Economic Growth Manager reported in 2020 that the Index had made a crucial contribution to the Leicestershire Market Towns Digital Project, via its deployment in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The project aimed to enhance the digital, retail and visitor offering of the county’s 11 market towns, which collectively employ more than 25,000 people and have an economic value of approximately GBP1.1 billion. The Economic Growth Manager remarked: “Our district council partners have used the information collected in the Index to better understand the levels and types of engagement at an individual business level... The project as a whole has been very successful, with... 581 businesses attending digital training \(300 target\). Without the Digital High Street Index we would have lacked proof that the project was working, and so for us the strongest value of this research has been in enabling our towns to improve the digital skills of their retailers – targeting the right people with the right support.” **\[S5\]** 

 Additionally, the Chief Executive of Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council and former Chair of the Leicestershire Market Towns Group reported in 2020 that the use of the Index across the county’s market towns had provided “very useful information and intelligence about the digital footprint and capabilities of our retailers”, leading to “a bespoke programme of support... based on the skills, needs and gaps identified through the research in areas where we have subsequently seen a 50% uptake in digital presence by retailers” **\[S6\]**. The Economic Development Officer at Blaby District Council reported in the same year that use of the Index had contributed to increased town\-centre footfall and length of stay, as well as greater digital presence and interest in digital training among local retailers **\[S7\]**. 

 <ins> *Warwickshire*</ins> 

 In a collaboration with the county council, the Index has also been used extensively across 15 market towns in Warwickshire. The county has 3,500 retail and service businesses, employing around 24,000 people. In 2018, reporting on the first stage of the work, which began a year earlier, a Local Government Association online article said: “In tandem with the Loughborough University research project, Warwickshire County Council has funded and delivered digital skills training... Around 70 businesses have undertaken the digital skills courses, with success stories including retailers that have expanded as a result of embracing digital.” **\[S8\]** One local small business owner said: “Since the training I have had my own website running for approximately five weeks now... and my Facebook, Messenger, Twitter and Instagram accounts are all linked. I am now sourcing my own work on a regular basis... I don’t believe I could have done this without being included on the digital skills course.” **\[S9\]** 

 The 

Team Leader for Town Centres and Tourism and the Project Manager for Infrastructure and Sustainable Communities at Warwickshire County Council jointly stated in 2020 that the Index had played a vital role in the Warwickshire Towns programme for local retailers. Specifically, they said it had been central to: 

-  “Highlighting how Warwickshire’s towns were performing in the digital arena, helping us become more aware of gaps and then supporting us to identify what, as a local authority, we could do to ensure that our retailers weren’t missing out on their digital potential. 

-  Providing a brilliant baseline of levels of digital engagement... insights we hadn’t previously had access to and which we have subsequently used to plan our services. 

-  Giving us a thorough and detailed evidence base so we could develop appropriate \[targeted\] interventions \(e.g., a digital training programme and one\-to\-one mentoring\). 

-  Evidencing the positive impacts of the programme... \[which\] has enabled us to justify the expenditure on further digital training and support.” **\[S9\]**

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Traditional methods of cost\-benefit analysis \(CBA\) under\-value investment in ‘smart’ technologies. To overcome this challenge, Queen Mary’s Prof. Moriarty developed a new Real Options CBA model, a decision\-making process, and software in collaboration with Electricity North West Ltd. \(ENWL\), the electricity distribution network for north\-west England. ENWL has incorporated Moriarty’s software tools to benefit 102,396 customers across 14 projects. ENWL has now integrated these tools as part of their business practice to compare flexible and inflexible capital investments. This change has enabled the network to provide better\-value electricity for 2,400,000 homes and informed National Grid policy on the use of Real Options in cost\-benefit analyses. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by Queen Mary’s Prof. Moriarty has played an instrumental role in overcoming the challenges of cost\-benefit analysis \(CBA\) for electricity distribution networks. Traditional methods of CBA are deterministic: they do not account for the value of uncertainty and flexibility, such as the ability to delay, expand, or scale back an investment, in energy networks. As a result, they under\-value new ‘smart’ technologies such as demand\-side response, a method that aims to reduce and redistribute peak\-time energy usage to mitigate strain and use resources more efficiently. Instead, they favour inflexible and capital\-intensive infrastructure \(e.g. transformers, overhead lines\). This makes it highly challenging for networks to compare flexible and inflexible network investments fairly, to justify ‘smart’ network upgrades, and to obtain best value for money by investing in energy\-use innovation. 

 Moriarty’s research uniquely demonstrates how a probabilistic approach, which accounts for randomness and flexibility, can be applied to investments in electricity distribution networks. His work \(for example, \[3.1\]\) builds on Real Options Analysis \(ROA\), a principled framework by which to calculate and compare the value of both flexible and inflexible investments. Moriarty first worked on developing a prototype spreadsheet implementation of ROA in collaboration with Dr. Pierluigi Mancarella \(University of Manchester\). 

 In 2016, he collaborated again with Mancarella and Dr. Rita Shaw at Electricity North West Ltd. \(ENWL\) \[3.2\] to develop and justify a novel stochastic model for how the inherently random \(stochastic\) process of peak network loads evolves over time. Moriarty’s unique contribution was to develop a ‘Real Options Cost Benefit Analysis’ \(RO CBA\) tool which does not require the assumption of geometric Brownian motion, an approach that is commonplace in mathematical finance, but one which has not been justified as a way of modelling electricity demand \[3.3\]. Instead, Moriarty’s approach develops the network operator’s own long\-term demand forecasts into a probabilistic framework for investment decision\-making. In addition, it provides an objective approach to quantifying appropriate demand\-side response compensation \(customers participating in demand\-side response require compensation, as such schemes rely upon customers temporarily reducing their demand\) \[3.4\]. 

 After developing and refining this model in work commissioned by ENWL, and adding a new metric \(‘least worst regret’\), Moriarty supported the electricity distribution network in extending and refining the prototype into a business\-as\-usual tool with which to evaluate the value and impact of network investments.

 Figure 1: Map of the UK with the area served by ENWL highlighted in blue 

Moriarty’s research and ‘Real Options Cost Benefit Analysis’ \(RO CBA\) tool set a precedent for its successful use in an electricity distribution network context, and generated three key impacts. It has: 

1.  Provided access to better\-value electricity for 5,000,000 people across 2,400,000 million homes 

1.  Informed strategic investment decision\-making at ENWL 

1.  Influenced guidelines on cost benefit analyses for national network investments and prevented potential losses 

  

#  Providing access to better\-value electricity for 5,000,000 people across 2,400,000 million homes 

 ENWL is one of 14 electricity distributors in the UK and serves 2,400,000 of the UK’s \~30,000,000 customers, in the north\-west of England \(area of service highlighted in Figure 1\). It owns, operates, maintains and upgrades 13,000km of overhead lines, 44,000km of underground cables, and related transformers and switchgear. 

 Moriarty’s RO CBA tool has been adopted by ENWL to compare investment strategies using a set of long\-term demand forecasting scenarios. It has been used to make 14 investment decisions, with 102,396 customers directly benefiting from local upgrades across the 14 projects. By using the tool, ENWL has improved the cost\-effectiveness of their electricity supply for 5,000,000 people across 2,400,000 homes according to Flexibility Solutions Manager Lois Clark, as the financial saving “is passed back to all 2.4 million of our customers in the form of reduced electricity bills. We recover our costs by charging electricity suppliers for the use of our network, which for domestic customers equates to about 16% of their average electricity bill” \[5.1\]. Moriarty’s tool provides a much improved method of risk assessment over the company’s prior process, as ""previously this was a time\-consuming task performed by hand, which did not identify an optimal strategy and lacked additional decision metrics \(e.g. risk assessments\) that the RO CBA model provides. The RO CBA model enables us to quantify the impact of each strategy, to ensure that the most cost\-effective and risk\-averse investments are made *”* \[5.1\]. 

#  Informing strategic investment decision\-making at ENWL 

 The RO CBA tool has found multiple applications within ENWL beyond its intended purpose, for example planning asset replacement schemes \[5.1\]. Across its network, ENWL faces two key issues: insufficient network capacity \(requiring network reinforcement\), and poor network health \(requiring asset replacement\). While the “RO CBA tool was originally developed with the intention of comparing traditional network reinforcement strategies against innovative demand side response solutions to address network capacity issues, the model is also now being applied to asset replacement schemes in order to determine the most cost\-effective replacement option. This further application of the model has greatly expanded its reach and usefulness within ENWL, as there is approximately triple the number of replacement versus reinforcement schemes,” according to ENWL’s Ms. Clark \[5.1\]. 

#  Influencing guidelines on cost benefit analyses for national network investments and preventing potential losses 

 National Grid plc, which owns and operates the UK’s national transmission network, uses Network Options Analysis \(NOA\) methodology to make recommendations for national network investments based on a set of future demand scenarios. In September 2016, industry regulator Ofgem requested a review of NOA due to concerns over its ability to make efficient investment recommendations, and, in 2017, the review was completed with notable and acknowledged input from Moriarty and ENWL \[5.2\]. Moriarty and his work with ENWL were *“*instrumental in influencing the methodological review and its resulting recommendations, which formed the basis of guidance on National Grid’s use of Real Options Analysis”, according to Adam Hutchinson, Head of Analytical Quality at Ofgem \[5.3\]. According to the report, “our ideas for how Real Options Analysis can be embedded within the NOA are based on the Electricity North West Ltd RO CBA model, and as such there is a precedent for this type of model being implemented in an electricity network context” \[5.2\]. 

 Moriarty’s research saved National Grid plc from potential financial losses stemming from unwise investments in network infrastructure. Dr. Hutchinson confirms that Moriarty *“*demonstrated that implicit assumptions within the Black\-Scholes framework were not appropriate to the network reinforcement context. As a result, I was able to advise National Grid that this approach not be taken forward. This prevented National Grid from implementing the NOA methodology which could have led to unwise network recommendations, costing consumers money. The methodology effectively modelled network investment risk and used Real Options Analysis in a more appropriate way than I had seen previously. The implementation of this methodology at ENWL, which improved performance and saved customers money, set a precedent for how we could effectively address parallel considerations at National Grid. This demonstrable value led me to recommend the approach as best practice in the NOA methodology review *”* \[5.3\]. Moriarty’s RO CBA model has set a precedent for its successful use in a UK electricity distribution network context and, as a result, has influenced related national guidelines.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Orkney’s archaeology sparks a unique contemporary creative engagement. Interdisciplinary research in the University of the Highlands & Islands \(UHI\) Archaeology Institute provides a distinctive Art/Archaeology framework for applied collaboration across professional, business, and voluntary sectors. Community\-focused research stimulates the creative and commercial practice of a diverse cohort of designers and artists, supporting Orkney’s rural economy. Art/Archaeology collaborations have directly led to the design, development and global marketing of three commercially successful new jewellery collections and one new contemporary fashion range. The research also supports training and Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) courses, extending this impact to a wider cohort of practitioners. This has created additional opportunities for community groups to engage with archaeology\-inspired creativity to the benefit of participants. By supporting employment, encouraging new pedagogies, influencing business practices and product development, and increasing sales for rural SMEs and Orkney’s creative industries, UHI’s Art/Archaeology research generates direct social, cultural, and economic impacts.

###  2. Underpinning research 

###  Over the past 12 years, the UHI Archaeology Institute has established an interdisciplinary research model, with Art/Archaeology as a key theme \[3.1 \- 3.6\]. Fundamental to our research is a focus on process, context, and the medium of creativity – in the past and the present. This has led to distinctive, interlinked areas of research, into interdisciplinary and site\-specific art practice \[3.1, 3.3, 3.4\], prehistoric art \[3.2\] and experimental mapping \[3.5, 3.6\]. This research explores creative engagements with archaeology, linking digital recording methods and archaeological representation with contextual understandings of heritage, place and identity. 

 In 2010\-11, Thomas and Lee organised a series of knowledge exchange activities focused on Art/Archaeology and involving a diverse group of academics, creative practitioners, and the wider community. These led to the Test Trenches interdisciplinary residency, a collaborative research project undertaken by Thomas and Lee with the Tabula Rasa contemporary arts collective \[3.1\]. This explored the Neolithic art of the Ness of Brodgar through a contemporary art lens and involved public workshops to encourage the creative interpretation of archaeological artefacts in the setting of the Pier Arts Centre gallery. This project laid the foundation for subsequent Art/Archaeology engagements. 

 Lee’s research focuses on experimental mapping and the representation of archaeological landscapes through walking \[3.5\] using handheld GPS \(Global Positioning System\) and Geographical Information Systems \(GIS\) \[3.6\]. This has developed into an innovative research\-led practice which explores methods of recording and \[re\]\-presenting archaeological sites and landscapes \[3.5, 3.6\]. This experimental mapping practice formed the basis for illustrative material produced during the ‘Wilder Being’ participatory art and archaeology project led by Bevan and Downes. This project, part of the 2014 ‘Being Human’ Festival of the Humanities, brought together artists, archaeologists, and the community in an Art/Archaeology workshop \[3.4\]. Its interdisciplinary model was developed in the ‘Archaeology Plus’ project, which saw Lee and Bevan collaborate with the Orkney Blide Trust, a local mental health charity. 

 Like Lee, Thomas also explores lines and process, focussing on Orkney’s prehistoric art and archaeology. Her research into stone\-carvings \(2011\-20\) has produced the largest catalogue of Neolithic art in the UK, numbering over 900 individual pieces \[3.2\]. Cataloguing involved new fieldwork and recording at the sites of Maeshowe and Skara Brae, and at the Ness of Brodgar excavations, within the *Heart of Neolithic Orkney* World Heritage Site. Orkney’s prehistoric art is dominated by abstract, linear patterns, and Thomas’ research into this visual language emphasises the process, rather than product, of this mark\-making \[3.1, 3.2\]. The catalogue produced as part of her research translated the stone carvings into digital line drawings, complemented by contextual analysis. 

 Bevan and Thomas, with Lee, have drawn on these research projects to create bespoke art/archaeology CPD workshops and educational packages for professional creative practitioners. The interdisciplinary approach has influenced participants’ creative practice, kickstarted collaborations with creative businesses and gained new audiences for Art/Archaeology inspired work. These collaborative conversations have generated new ways of working, led to the development of new product ranges, and increased revenue for Orkney’s creative industries. Lee’s mapping techniques inspired designer Kirsteen Stewart to collaborate on a series of experimental maps, which were then translated into designs for a new clothing and accessories range. Thomas’ interpretative research – together with the digital drawings and photographs she produced as part of this \[3.2\] – have been at the core of the collaborations and impact with Ola Gorie Jewellery and Sheila Fleet Jewellery

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> **Economic</ins> <ins>impact: Contributing to Orkney’s creative</ins> <ins>industries**</ins> 

 The UHI’s Art/Archaeology research has boosted creative SMEs in Orkney by contributing to the design, development, and marketing of new products and the adoption of new business models. Mike Gardens, chair of Creative Orkney, an industry body of 49 member organisations, recognises that this work “contributes significantly to the ‘Orkney Brand, successfully used by Orkney\-based businesses in national and international markets” \[5.1\]. This research has directly influenced three creative businesses: Ola Gorie Jewellery, Sheila Fleet Jewellery, and Kirsteen Stewart Fashion Design. These have a combined annual turnover of £4.5m, with a global reach evidenced by markets in the UK, Europe, USA and Japan \[5.2, 5.3, 5.5\]. 

 **Ola Gorie Jewellery** \(OGJ\), has a turnover of £???, supporting 13 employees. Collaborative discussions between Susan Cross \(award\-winning goldsmith and designer\), Ola Gorie MBE \(jeweller\), and Antonia Thomas during the 2015 Art/Archaeology CPD course led to the design, development and production of their latest range, the *Ness of Brodgar* collection \[https://www.olagoriejewellery.com/blogs/craft\-design/meet\-sue\-cross\]. For Cross, the engagement with Thomas’ research “had a strong impact on my practice and brought about a new way of working’ \[5.4\]. As OJG’s director states, “the research of Dr Antonia Thomas was … absolutely invaluable – the collection would never have been created without the input and inspiration from this process” \[5.2\]. The collection – one of over 70 offered by OGJ \- comprises 22 pieces \(brooch, earrings, pendants, in different metals, totalling 41 products\). It is the company’s best\-selling range, and in 2019 alone, the Ness of Brodgar pieces accounted for 25% of sales of OGJ’s Orkney collections \[5.2\], a significant contribution to this rural SME’s turnover. 

 Thomas’ research into Neolithic art \[3.1, 3.2\] directly informed the design process for this collection, leading to increased revenue for the company. Continuing collaborative work between Thomas, Lee, and OGJ, has built on this success, inspiring OGJ to focus their business model on digital studio and web marketing of the archaeology\-inspired collections. This will allow global customers to engage with the story behind OGJ’s uniquely important collections from the comfort of their own homes \[5.2\]. This has become particularly timely, as COVID\-19 has devastated Orkney’s creative economy, which relies on physical visitors. The Art/Archaeology collaborative process is impacting on the company’s future business model and commercial strategy, in bringing “changes to the way \[OGJ\] as a business approach the design and marketing of new collections” \[5.2\]. 



 **Sheila Fleet Jewellery** has been at the forefront of Orkney’s jewellery industry since 1993, with 55 employees in Orkney, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The company has a turnover of £???, with 118 collections sold through retail outlets in the UK and globally online. The design, development, and production of two new collections have been directly inspired by the Ness of Brodgar rock art featured in Thomas’ research \[5.3\]. Launched in 2016, the *Lunar* and *Brodgar Eye* ranges contain 21 and 12 pieces respectively \(earrings, rings, pendants, cufflinks, bangles, necklets, bracelets\) and have so far contributed £???? to the business \[5.3\]. 



 **Kirsteen Stewart Fashion Design** has an annual turnover of £?????. The small but growing sustainable rural microbusiness has 18 clothing and accessory collections which sell in the UK, Europe, and Japan, with a global customer base online. Inspired by Lee’s experimental mapping research \[3.6\] explored in the Art/Archaeology CPD course, Daniel Lee and Kirsteen Stewart developed an innovative creative process linking digital archaeological drawing with contemporary product design. They collaborated on unique place\-specific drawings, translated into digital ‘maps’ and inspiring the *WANDER* collection of 12 items of clothing and accessories: “each a form of mobile map embodying landscape” \[5.5\]. The collection has contributed £???? to the business since its 2018 launch, but the creative process of working between Art and Archaeology has had wider impacts. For Stewart, the design process “led to changes in practice for me as a designer \[and\] demonstrated the potential for combining academic research and collaborations in product design” \[5.5\]. As a result, Stewart is now “pursuing international collaborations in Asia” \[5.5\]. The collaboration continues with a relaunch planned for 2021. 



 Building on these successes, a two\-day Knowledge Exchange workshop in February 2020, led by Thomas, Lee and Bevan brought together Creative Industries professionals and creative practitioners from across Orkney to discuss the UHI’s Art/Archaeology research and potential for future engagement. The participants noted the strong impact that UHI’s Art/Archaeology research has made on Orkney’s Creative Economy and several further projects are in development. An additional workshop, to explore the role of Art/Archaeology research for Creative Industries in Orkney’s post\-Covid economy, is planned for Spring 2021. 

 <ins> **Professional and pedagogical impact: Research\-led engagement between archaeologists and creative practitioners**</ins> 

 Bevan and Thomas have used the interdisciplinary research approach of Art/Archaeology to develop a unique suite of professional training courses, including an MA in Contemporary Art and Archaeology, the only course of its kind in the world, and internationally validated for 2020 delivery. It builds on the successful programme of CPD courses which have run since 2016, which have seen 130 creative practitioners from the USA, Canada, Italy, France, Ireland and the UK engage with the UHI’s Art/Archaeology model. Training draws upon a unique combination of Thomas’ archaeological study of Neolithic art, Lee’s experimental maps, and Bevan’s practice\-led art pedagogy. For one professional creative practitioner who took the course in 2019\-20, the engagement with the research of Thomas, Lee and Bevan, encouraged new “ways of looking and inhabiting the world”, inspiring her to “develop further my art practice \[and\] enabled me to reach new audiences” \[5.6\]. Of the 27 MA students who started in September 2020, 14 have previously undertaken one of the Art/Archaeology CPD courses run by Thomas and Bevan. Two further CPD alumni are now pursuing PhD research in Art/Archaeology. 

 <ins> **Social impact: Creative engagement in Orkney’s archaeology**</ins> 

 UHI’s interdisciplinary Art/Archaeology methodology brings together professionals and the wider community across Orkney, enhancing wellbeing and supporting training. The Test Trenches Art/Archaeology research residency \[3.1\] in 2011 – together with the ‘Wilder Being’ Art/Archaeology project \[3.4\] – established models of interdisciplinary research, bringing together artists, archaeologists and community groups. Participants explored creative interpretations of archaeology using digital and analogue recording techniques \[3.1, 3.4\], a methodology further developed in the ‘Archaeology Plus’ Project \(2018\-2019\). This was led by Bevan and Lee in collaboration with the Orkney Blide Trust, a charity offering mental health services for 150 people and their carers across Orkney. Archaeology Plus workshops engaged 30 members, who learned about artefacts, photography skills, and expressed creative responses to the archaeological materials and processes during arts workshops. The project resulted in an exhibition and display at Laura Grimond House which was open to the public on an open day. Service users developed creative responses to archaeological artefacts and excavations, which “taught them new skills and created an atmosphere where they could build up social networks, thereby reducing their isolation” \[5.7\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Violence perpetrated against health and social care staff constitutes an issue of long\-standing significance yet limited research, especially where the perpetrator exhibits learning disabilities. Chester University researchers investigated service\-user aggression, extrapolating the inter\-relationship of individual history, mental health diagnoses, cognitive capacity, and staff perceptions, i.e., ‘complexity’, required to understand service\-user interpersonal violence. Training and educational resources were developed to enhance staff de\-escalation skills, including a training DVD, and a series of de\-escalation workshops; feedback indicated significant changes in staff perceptions and responses toward service\-user violence. Furthermore, findings led to revisions in pedagogic practice at the University of Chester. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

###  Context: the definition of ‘complexity’ 

 Multiple social and psychological factors shape individuals and drive their behaviour, for example stability of family background, being abused, mental ill health, personality disorders, autism, and learning disability. Such factors when combined create the cocktail we term ‘complexity’. 

 Use of restraint on service\-users by nurses and other professionals should only be used as a last resort. The ‘Time for Change’ report stated: “ *Services will seek to reduce the use of physical intervention, seclusion, mechanical restraint and the inappropriate or harmful use of medication with the clear aim of eliminating them for each individual.”* \(NHS 2014, Appendix 3\) 

 Research conducted between 2008 and 2018 was instrumental in clarifying the picture around service\-user violence and aggression, and nurses’ subsequent response. **Lovell’s** work investigating staff understanding of, and response to, service\-user aggression and violence highlighted that the relationship between nurses and service\-users in forensic learning disability services was influential in experiencing and reporting incidents of violence and aggression. Moreover, understanding the antecedents to service\-user behaviour and its response were identified as key when resolving potentially violent situations. 

###  Qualitative data gathering \(2014\-2018\) 

 **R1**: This study consisted of a whole\-population survey of 411 nurses working within a variety of settings within the learning disability division of one mental health NHS Trust regarding disparities in the reporting of violent incidents. Differences were found between specific clinical environments, skill mix, and staff education. This research, along with earlier work, would underpin the initial development of the DVD; an attempt to update and supplement staff knowledge of de\-escalation when dealing with violent incidents. 

 **R2**: This in\-depth qualitative research yielded rich data which suggested forensic learning disability nurses were aware of the importance of knowing a service\-user, including what could trigger an instance of potential violence. However, there was also evidence nurses were not always effective in recognising when incidents had been triggered and when individuals were escalating towards violence. 

 **R3** & **R4**: We undertook further qualitative research with forensic learning disability nurses, obtaining in\-depth data indicating that nurses believed there were distinct requirements to being a good forensic learning disability nurse. The requirements were described in terms of clinical competence and personal attributes. This further highlighted that how staff respond to violence and aggression is linked to their knowledge of the service\-user and their own personal background and context. 

 This rich, qualitative data, once synthesised, contributed to the further development of the nascent concept of complexity and the subsequent production of training and educational resources. 

 **R5**: The next piece of research, a series of interviews with a multi\-professional group, explored how they sought to explain violence by people with an intellectual disability. The study again confirmed a reluctance to engage with the evidence, and provided a clear distinction, in the experience of participants, according to degree of intellectual disability, with greater culpability accredited to the more able. The role of additional diagnoses, such as autism spectrum disorder, significantly affected participant interpretation of violence, multiple diagnoses enhancing more generous understanding. Further factors arising from the study, relating to impulsivity, intentionality and unpredictability, when associated with the intellectual disability, influenced the degree of professional tolerance of violence. 

 **R6**: The final piece of research, interviews with nurses from low, medium, and high secure settings, consolidated the developing concept of complexity in relation to people with an intellectual disability. The resultant article emphasised that people with an intellectual disability and a background of offending were being cared for most effectively in community settings, but this necessitated a re\-evaluation of the knowledge and skills nurses required to develop therapeutic relationships. This final article helped to refine the theoretical model by exploring how personal history related to offending behaviour, and how this affected how nurses needed to work in the community without the reliance on secure settings. 

###  Development of the Model \(2017\-2021\) 

 Research led to the development of a theoretical model of de\-escalation, illustrating and explaining the antecedents to violence and aggression. The model was presented initially at the University of Chester, before being presented internationally at the 10th European Congress on Violence in Clinical Psychiatry \(26th\-28th October 2017\). ‘Restricting Physical Interventions’ was subsequently presented, by invitation, as a workshop at the British Institute for Learning Disabilities Conference \(Birmingham, 4th & 5th March 2018\). These presentations were well attended and the model was well received. Finally, the model was presented as a keynote address at the Faculty Post\-Graduate Research Conference at the University of Chester in June 2018. The presentations provided a forum for discussion, critique and subsequent reflection regarding the best means of publishing the material. 

 The research detailed in this section further emphasises the recognition and esteem of Professor Andrew Lovell as one of the experts on forensic learning disabilities studies in the UK.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The ongoing research of Professor Andrew Lovell and his colleagues has contributed to regional, national, and international changes in staff practice within organisations requiring de\-escalation skills, with particular emphasis on service\-users with learning disabilities. 

###  DVD and training package 

 One outcome was the decision to produce a DVD, presenting scenarios related to violence and aggression, and supporting materials, examining how nurses can use their interpersonal skills most effectively to prevent violence **\[S1\]**. The training package “ *Violence in health and social care settings: A training resource package for organisations and individuals*” includes analysing the DVD scenarios, and focusing on how staff dealing with potentially violent situations might react in such circumstances. 

 The DVD was presented internationally, and purchased by several organisations, including a Czech national trainer, and the material was presented by invitation in Prague \(Vysoká škola tělesné výchovy a sportu Palestra: 10<sup>th</sup> Scientific Conference\) on 14<sup>th</sup> May 2014.  The DVD was also used by Oud Consultancy of Amsterdam **\[S2a & S2b\]**. 

 Examples of UK national impact include use of the DVD in staff training by three specialist learning disability services: New Focus **\[S3\]**, Calderstones Partnership NHS **\[S4\]**, and Merseycare Learning Disability Directorate. New Focus, an independent sector organisation closely linked with the work cited here, used the DVD in teaching staff about de\-escalation, using staff to the theoretical model as a means of working with offenders with a background of violence and/or offending behaviour as part of the community support packages provided by the organisation **\[S3\]**. 

 Further development of this research resulted in the production of a model of violence and aggression, highlighting how the interaction of service\-users’ life histories, mental health conditions, and cognitive status \(defined as complexity\) contribute to aggressive and violent behaviour. The model also emphasises that nurses’ understanding of their own response to situations and others’ behaviour influences how they evaluate and address aggression and violence. 

###  Workshop 

 In 2016, discussions took place with Merseycare Learning Disability Secure Services to develop a teaching package supporting its existing approach to managing violence. The esteem generated through Professor Lovell’s research and connections assisted in the development of this intervention; *“Through our pre\-existing relationship with Professor Andy Lovell, and his long\-established record of conducting research in this area over many years, we were fortunate enough to find a natural partner… Clearly Professor Lovell had extensive knowledge and experience of the Subject”* **\[S5\]**. A two\-day interactive workshop was developed which incorporated tasks to facilitate participants identify what triggered their anger, their response when faced with aggression, and how to evaluate situations to avoid escalation. 

 Previously, the emphasis within de\-escalation has generally focused on the acquisition of certain key skills, whereas we accentuate understanding of service\-users \(background, learning disability, additional diagnoses\), and how to apply this knowledge when addressing incidents of violence and aggression. Moreover, the workshop also emphasises how application of practical skills such as observation and active listening, in tandem with understanding service\-users’ life histories, can result in early identification and de\-escalation of situations which may result in a violent incident. Theoretical information was also delivered, including discussion of the de\-escalation model we have developed. The value of the workshop and the model relates to nurses leading the way in supporting this population to lead healthy and productive lives. 

 We were subsequently commissioned to deliver a series of workshops to all Merseycare Learning Disability Secure Service nursing staff \(qualified and unqualified\) and some allied healthcare professionals \(clinical psychologists, occupational therapists\). Staff trainers from another Merseycare site also attended to assess whether the workshop would benefit staff working in high\-secure mental health settings. Seven workshops with a total of 106 attendees were delivered between October 2016 and April 2017, generating income of £15,000. Each workshop was evaluated in terms of how staff attending perceived the potential benefit for their work in clinical practice, and evaluations were subsequently collated to determine the overall impact for the workforce **\[S6\]**. 

 Feedback from managers was positive; *“Throughout the course of the project, Professor Lovell and his team proved to be an invaluable asset and trusted partner. His expertise, coupled with an ability to relate to and engage with staff at all levels, were undoubtedly the main factors in the results achieved”* **\[S5\]**. Feedback from attendee evaluations was also positive, especially the emphasis on the need to understand individual complexity when working with potentially violent individuals. 77.3% attendees reported the workshops would impact practice, primarily through the discussion facilitated on the course, the exercises undertaken \(attendee involvement was critical\), and improved knowledge about de\-escalation; additionally, 92.4% of attendees stated they would recommend the workshops to colleagues **\[S6\]**. 

###  Pedagogy 

 The research and resources developed have also changed pedagogic practise at the University of Chester. Initially, the DVD was utilised in teaching sessions with students of learning disability nursing, and focused on approaches to and management of potentially violent situations. Once developed further, the de\-escalation model was incorporated into the nursing curriculum, providing insight into the development of service\-user potential violence, and influencing how we respond to it. The model is now embedded within the University pre\-registration nursing curriculum **\[S7\]**.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Dr Baronchelli’s expertise is in understanding and modelling emerging global properties of large socio\-technical systems. His research relies on mathematical and multi\-agent modelling, big data analysis and experiments with human subjects.  Dr Baronchelli’s research focuses on two main subjects. In network science, specifically analysis and modelling of temporally evolving networks Baronchelli’s research tackled issues such as the complexity of social networks and presented empirical analysis in which such structures are described as temporal multiplex networks, i.e., networks whose edges \(1\) belong to different layers \(representing different kinds of interactions\) and \(2\) have an intrinsic dynamic of creation and annihilation \[3.1\]. This naturally led to the development of the second, more recent, subject, which focuses on the analysis of blockchain transactions networks and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The latter includes analysis of long\-term and short\-term properties of the cryptocurrency market \[3.2\] \[3.3\] and the impact of information production and consumption on cryptocurrency prices. \[3.4\] 

 Given the strength of Dr Baronchelli’s research and his continuing engagement with the sector, he and his co\-researchers, which included Abeer ElBahrawy, decided to investigate the dynamics of dark web marketplaces. The research programme, which was part of the overall partnership between his team and Chainalysis, aimed to understand the reasons for the dark web marketplaces growth in popularity, despite being extremely unreliable and exposing users to significant monetary losses. Understanding the origin of this apparent paradox is crucial as dark markets have become a focus both for police forces and governments \(see, e.g., NYT article “Dark Web Drug Sellers Dodge Police Crackdowns”, June 11, 2019\), and keep expanding \(see e.g., Bloomberg article “Darknet Market Had a Record 2020”, Feb. 1, 2021\) 

 The work investigated the consequences of 24 episodes of sudden market closures \(as a result of a scam or a police seizure\), identified as critical events for users. The Chainalysis novel dataset of 138 million Bitcoin transactions allowed the team to follow the behaviour of single individuals. Baronchelli et al. analysed the large temporal network of transactions and showed that, when a market closes, users migrate swiftly and the vast majority coordinate predictably on a single alternative marketplace, despite having multiple choices. Thus, while single markets might appear unreliable, the ecosystem of markets is resilient to single point failures and guarantees continuity to the trading activity. \[3.5\] 

 These results clarify the dynamics of dark web marketplaces and represent a crucial first step to design effective strategies to contrast them. Furthermore, b, they reveal a mechanism of systemic resilience \[3.5\] that has been thus far overlooked but that will be of interest for researchers in a number of disciplines, the private sector \(blockchain firms, intelligence firms, etc\) and law enforcement agencies. 

 The methodologies developed as part of this research were also used to further examine Dark web marketplace behaviour during the covid\-19 pandemic, in a project led by Dr. Baronchelli and funded by ESRC as part of UK Research and Innovation’s rapid response to COVID\-19, through grant ES/V00400X/1, by analysing 472,372 listings extracted from 23 DWMs between January 1, 2020 and July 7, 2020 including 788 COVID\-19 specific listings that range from protective masks to hydroxychloroquine medicine. \(publication in 2021\) Additionally, Dr Baronchelli has continued his research on the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem. By studying the collaboration network of 6341 developer on the code of 298 cryptocurrencies stored in GitHub Baronchelli et al. identified a clear link between the collaborative development of cryptocurrencies and their market behaviour. More broadly, they revealed a so\-far overlooked systemic dimension for the transparency of code\-based ecosystems that will be of interest for researchers, investors, and regulators. \[3.6\]

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact of Dr Baronchelli’s research encompasses contribution to innovation, financial benefits for the partner company and indirect impact for the product users. 

 **Translating research to Impact:**   Building on an initial partnership between Chainalysis and City, University of London, Abeer ElBahrawy, then a PhD researcher, interned at Chainalysis during the summer of 2018. The project was to investigate, with Dr Baronchelli’s guidance and supervision, if and how users of darknet markets move between markets when a market closes, by analysing the blockchain transactions involving darknet markets. This project raised a significant challenge: how to identify and track the activity of users across different markets \- that is to say, how to identify the set of transactions that connect darknet markets. \[text removed for publication\] \[5.1\]. Utilising the knowledge and insights garnered the company proceed to invest internally and eventually developed techniques that were incorporated in their flagship products Chainalysis KYT & Chainalysis Reactor \[5.1\]\[text removed for publication\] \[5.2\] 

 **Impact achieved by project partners:**  \[text removed for publication\] \[5.1\] their revenue growth earned the company a place in the 2019 Forbes Next Billion Dollar Start\-up List \[5.3\] and on the Forbes Fintech 50 2020 \[5.4\] \[text removed for publication\] \[5.5\]. 

 **Achievements and benefits for the users:** As discussed Chainalysis currently has a client list of 250 organisations in 40 countries across the globe. These include government agencies, exchanges, and financial institutions in the US, UK, etc. Its biggest customers include the US federal government, Barclays and Bittrex among other, all of whom have experienced increased benefits, such as better real\-time anti\-money laundering \(AML\) compliance, through the use of Chainalysis updated products. 

 Specific examples of impact achieved through the Chainalysis tools are quite numerous. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Chainalysis is also achieving market impact via collaborations and partnerships such as with Tether in February 2020. Tether is the preeminent stablecoin with the biggest market capitalization, surpassing that of all rival offerings combined. Created in October 2014, Tether has grown to become the most traded cryptocurrency. The collaboration means that the Tether platform can monitor the stablecoin's usage across its blockchain, enabling the real\-time tracking of suspicious transactions through integration with Chainalysis KYT via API. This translates to real time risk management on one of the largest digital currency platforms globally, an unquantifiable benefit to users and regulators equally, as well as for the platform itself: ""As one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, we have a responsibility not just to regulators but also to the cryptocurrency ecosystem to have transparent, automated compliance solutions in place to handle any amount of volume at any given time. This solution allows us to ensure a secure compliance program that fosters trust with regulators, law enforcement agencies and users. This is achieved without sharing our user's identifying information, as such data is only kept on our servers.""” Chief Technology Officer, Tether. \[5.8\] 

 **Shaping understanding in the Industry**: Dr Baronchelli’s research is also having impact in shaping the understanding and perceptions on cryptocurrency and market behaviour. Through his research \[3.4\] and by leading the discussion through a number of activities and platforms Dr Baronchelli has managed to influence key leaders in the sector. Via the research themes “Economic data science” and “Token economy” that he leads at The Alan Turing Institute, he managed to bring together researchers and industrial partners interested in understanding the socio\-economic implications of the token economy and make sense of what is happening in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This translated in increased overall understanding and impacted on the industry’s approach when dealing with the evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape. Industry pioneers such as Coinrule, have “ *experienced positive benefits thanks to the research, as well as new partnerships by supporting programmes such as the Token Economy*”. \[5.9\] 

 The research, being the first of its kind to look at the dark market ecosystems, has helped key industry players in expand their understanding of the dark web. The data and conclusions that the research has generated, have informed industry reports. The Chainalysis “The State of 2020 Crypto Crime” Report serves as an example, since it relies heavily on the underpinning research, especially the “Darknet Markets” chapters. This indicates clear impact on the way blockchain analysis companies understand the dynamics of the dark web and how they subsequently react. \[5.10\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The research has had significant national impact by developing an evidence\-based understanding of consumer borrowing decisions in the digital HCSTC \(High Cost Short Term Credit\) market, which has: 

1.  Increased availability of affordable credit to low\-income borrowers across the UK, through the co\-development of a new digital credit platform \( *Just Borrow*\) with UK credit unions. 

1.  Changed how debt advice is given in relation to HCSTC across a range of organisations and charities in England and Scotland, including Citizens Advice, Money Advice Scotland, Wiseradviser, and the Institute of Money Advisers. 

1.  Transformed consumer understanding to support safer borrowing habits through the production and dissemination of an innovative digital app \( *Indebted Life*\). The app, developed by the project team and a local software company, offers users a chance to play as three fictional characters \(drawing upon anonymised real\-life experiences from the research, see PUB 1, 2, 3\) to explore the implications of applying for digital credit in a safe way. The app has been promoted and used in partnership with Money Advice Scotland, Wiseradviser, and the Institute of Money Advisers.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Ash was Principal Investigator on the two year \(2016\-18\) ESRC\-funded project *Digital Interfaces and Debt: Understanding Mediated Decision Making Processes in High\-Cost Short\-Term Credit Products,* with co\-investigators Prof Ben Anderson \(Durham University\), Prof Paul Langley \(Durham University\) and Research Associate Dr Rachel Gordon \(Newcastle University\) *.* Ash is an internationally recognised expert in digital interfaces and culture, having conducted research in this area for the last 10 years. Evidence of this expertise includes the publication of 2 well received monographs *The Interface Envelope* \(2015, Bloomsbury\) and *Phase Media* \(2018, Bloomsbury\) and over 20 journal articles in top\-ranked journals in the area of Communication, Cultural and Media Studies including *Theory, Culture and Society.* 

  

 The research investigated how access to digital credit on digital devices is influencing consumer borrowing decisions and their understandings of indebtedness in relation to new forms of digitally mediated credit. The HCSTC market, where consumers borrow money for short periods \(usually between 1\-30 days\) at high interest rates, has grown hugely over the last 7 years, often creating significant harm for consumers, including unsustainable debt and mental health problems associated with indebtedness \(PUB 1, 2\). At the time the research was conducted, the cash and pay day loan market \(a well\-publicised part of HCSTC\) was estimated to be worth GBP2,000,000,000 a year \(Competition and Markets Authority \[CMA\] 2015\). The growth of this market was largely driven by the ease of access to these products digitally, through smart phones, PC’s and other digital devices, with 82% of all cash and pay day loans in the UK applied for and approved online \(CMA 2015\). To understand how digital devices and the design of interfaces shaped consumer experience, the research involved original empirical investigation, including 11 interviews with web and app user interface \(UI\) and user experience \(UX\) designers, some of whom had worked on the biggest HCSTC platforms; 40 interviews with consumers who had accessed HCSTC online; and 10 interviews with representatives from financial regulators \(including the Financial Conduct Authority \[FCA\] and the CMA\), money advice organisations, and debt advice charities. 

 Through an innovative and original focus on the relationship between technology and embodied practice, data from the research demonstrated that: 

1.  The digitally mediated nature of applying for these loans had a direct and significant impact on consumers decision to borrow, and how much they borrowed \(PUB 1, 2\). Consumers would regularly end up borrowing more than they initially intended and this increase in amount borrowed could be directly traced back to the design of the interfaces for these products \(PUB 3\). The increase in borrowing was not forced upon the consumer, but encouraged through the playful design of different aspects of the interface \(e.g. the loan amount slider\), which discouraged the consumer to critically reflect on the loan’s affordability. This data challenged predominant academic, media and regulatory accounts, which suggested that digital interfaces played no significant role in borrowers decision making regarding HCSTC and digital credit in general \(e.g. Aldohni 2017\). 

1.  The cost of borrowing had no real effect on decisions to borrow \(PUB 2\). This data challenged both regulator and debt advice sector understandings of HCSTC and digitally mediated credit in general. For example, the FCA’s regulation of the HCSTC market \(introduced in 2015\) focused on the cost of credit only \(e.g. total cost cap\), and assumed that capping the total cost of a loan would limit consumer harm and discourage consumers from taking out loans. In a similar manner, the debt advice sector would often base consumer education on helping consumers understand the actual cost of borrowing \(e.g. total repayment of a loan including interest\). While these are important and significant interventions, the evidence from the research demonstrated that cost, or awareness of cost, did not significantly affect consumer’s decision to borrow \(PUB 1\). Rather, actual consumer borrowing is shaped by space\-times of decisions and human interaction with digital interfaces, which is explicitly tied to experiences of indebtedness \(PUB 1, 2\). 

 The originality of these findings resulted in significant national media coverage in a range of print, radio and online media including *BBC News* \(347,000,000 global digital readers\), *The Times* \(print readership 359,960, digital readership 304,000\) and *Radio 4* \(10,500,000 listeners\) and in specialist credit and debt industry publications such as the *Money Advisers Quarterly Account* \(1,900 print subscribers\) and the *Consumer Credit Trade Association Magazine* \(1,000\+ industry specific email distribution\). In turn, Ash has been invited to speak over 20 times internationally and nationally since 2018 on these issues in the US, China, Sweden, Netherlands and Germany to a range of audiences, from national regulators \(FCA\) and government officials \(HM Treasury\), to debt advice charities \(Money Advice Scotland, Citizens Advice\) and financial thinktanks \(New Economics Foundation\). Through significantly expanding and challenging dominant accounts of digital credit, findings from the research offered important original evidence to credit unions, regulators and the debt advice sector, which resulted in significant national impact \(see section 4\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Significant national impact from the research can be organised into 2 main areas. In the first, the research has directly influenced and informed the design and creation of a credit union backed digital credit platform \( *Just Borrow*\). In the second, the research has directly led to changes in debt advice education for a range of national debt advice organisations. 

 **a\) Impact on increasing the availability of affordable credit to low\-income borrowers across the UK.** 

 Ash worked with representatives from the Financial Inclusion Centre, GRE Consulting, London Mutual Credit Union, and Lewisham Plus Credit Union on the launch of a new digital credit platform \( *Just Borrow*\) that specifically targets low\-income borrowers and allows them to borrow quickly and easily without the costs associated with HCSTC. This involved: 1. Co\-delivery of a workshop with stakeholders to identify ways in which the research could be used to improve the usability and functionality of *Just Borrow*; 2. Collaborative user testing of the platform between the research team at Newcastle University and stakeholders; and 3. Production of a final recommendations report. This made explicit reference to original empirical material, especially interviews with HCSTC users and UI and UX designers \(PUB 3, 4\). Impact was delivered by addressing a specific problem experienced by *Just Borrow* stakeholders, outlined in their words in a letter of support: *‘One of the problems we encountered was how to design a digital platform that could compete with high\-cost lenders and appeal to consumers as a viable alternative. This is where your research has had the most impact for us… \[enabling\] us to make evidence\-based changes that have improved the look, feel and functionality of the platform’* \(SOURCE 1\). This led to direct improvements of the platform, including real\-time calculation of total loan cost on the loan slider, repositioning of buttons to gain prominence and clarity, improved tone of voice, clearer application form presentation, and live application form guidance to improve consumer understanding. The evidence provided by the research helped the *Just Borrow* team ‘ *to* *recruit new credit unions \[…\] support\[ing\] the extension of its reach, increas\[ing\] credit union membership and benefit\[ting\] more consumers with affordable credit.’* \(SOURCE 1\). *Just Borrow* is now live with 12 UK credit unions. It is estimated that *Just Borrow* will save borrowers between GBP386 and GBP515 in interest alone on an average loan of GBP600 over a 6\-month term \(SOURCE 1\). In its first year, *Just Borrow* has lent over GBP250,000 to customers, saving borrowers GBP000s in interest, compared to high\-cost alternatives and its credit union partnerships means it now covers 31% of the UK population \(SOURCE 2\). Borrowers using the platform have stated: ‘ *I’d used payday loans in the past and got into increasing debt. A Just Borrow loan has helped me break the cycle and I am now looking forward to be debt free’.* Furthermore, 100% of those who used and reviewed *Just Borrow* would recommend it to family and friends \(SOURCE 3\). As a result, the *Just Borrow* platform has been accredited as an ethical finance product by the charity Fairlife, and such a reputation will ensure its continuing utility in the future \(SOURCE 2\). 

 **b\) Impact on national debt advice giving** 

 The research has directly improved debt advisers’ understanding of consumer borrowing decisions and helped them to better understand how digital access to credit can increase instances of impulse borrowing, especially for vulnerable consumers, which has transformed how they give advice and support. 

 Specifically: 

1.  Ash co\-designed and co\-delivered an online training webinar for Wiseradviser, the national training arm of the Money Advice Trust. Wiseradviser provides training and support to debt advisers in the UK and is accredited by the Money Advice Service Quality Framework. The webinar was based entirely on the research findings and is available as a CPD resource \(worth one CPD point\) for money advisers to access. 72 advisers have accessed the webinar in 2019 and Wiseradviser estimated another 70 accessed the webinar in 2020. 92% of advisers who completed feedback rated the webinar as Good or Excellent. The great majority \(92%\) of advisers said that the webinar improved or refreshed their knowledge and *‘made them think differently’* about online lending and its impact on borrowers \(SOURCE 4\). 

1.  The research directly led to the reframing of a National Institute of Money Advisers course for money advisers. The previously titled Sub Prime Lending course has been renamed to High Cost Credit to reflect the changing landscape of UK credit services \(SOURCE 5\). The evidence\-based findings were incorporated into the training, focusing in particular on who borrows high\-cost credit and the reasons why people borrow. Feedback from the course writer said that the research findings made them rethink the reach of the high\-cost credit market in terms of people affected \(not just those in poverty but also those in work\) and the significance of digital credit access \(its ease, availability, and speed\). To date, 46 money advisers have attended the updated High Cost Credit course and feedback has been extremely positive, with the IMA stating the research ensured *‘training is up\-to\-date and evidence\-based’* \(SOURCE 6\). 

1.  Co\-development and co\-delivery of financial wellbeing sessions for money advice practitioners in partnership with Clean Slate Financial Wellbeing Services CIC. To date, a total of 20 people have attended these sessions. Our specific contribution drew explicitly from the research and included: a. how digital access to credit is changing where and when people apply for and use credit and their experiences of indebtedness; b. how high\-cost credit changes people's relationship with money, credit, and debt; c. real\-life experiences of people who use high\-cost credit and its consequences; d. how high\-cost credit providers deliberately use design techniques to shape consumer decision\-making. During sessions, we also facilitated interactive exercises involving the *Indebted Life* app. Some of the practitioners we trained have taken on the role of ‘Financial Wellbeing Champions’ in their community setting, implementing their learning to help people they come into contact with who may be facing money and debt issues. We also demonstrated how *Indebted Life* could be used in one\-to\-one and group settings. All practitioners said that they would use the app in their work, with feedback highlighting the app was an *‘informative…experience to show how easy a split second decision can effect other people’* \(SOURCE 7\). 

1.  The *Indebted Life* app, and the activities the research team designed, have been used in other settings, including by Money Advice Scotland in secondary school outreach work. Feedback from those using the *Indebted Life* app included *: ‘It really \[made me\] think about the consequences of making rash decisions without any actual risk’, ‘It \[helped me\] to understand payday loans better’*. When asked if the app had changed the way users thought about money management and use of HCSTC, one person said *‘\[It made me think about how to\] budget finances and to work out if taking out the loan is affordable every month’* \(SOURCE 7\). 

1.  Citizens Advice Newcastle said the research revealed how much pressure their clients are under \(and the lived experiences of borrowing HCSTC\). The research has benefitted the organisation because staff are now *‘better able to understand our clients’ debt problems’* and, as a result, staff *‘have been better able to articulate our clients’ problems’*. This has made them even more determined to challenge poor practice by lenders as an organisation with a campaigning arm \(SOURCE 7\). Quaker Social Action said the research gave the organisation *‘a better understanding of how people use these services…’*, especially in terms of using HCSTC as a source of monthly income, and the impact technology has on consumer decision making. When asked what changes have taken place in the organisation as a result of the research, respondents stated that the research has directly influenced the design of a new course that links digital and financial skills \(SOURCE 8\). 

 As a result of these impacts, the research has significantly altered understandings of both HCSTC in particular and the problems associated with digital credit more generally. This impact has been national and influenced and shaped a range of actors and practices, from informing the design of new affordable credit platforms, to creating new accredited educational content and releasing innovative educational apps that benefit vulnerable and low\-income borrowers. The collaborative nature of these changes, and how they have been embedded into organisations, ensures that the impact from the research will continue to have an effect and *‘inform future research and campaigns work’* \(SOURCE 8\) as the debt advice sector responds to the growing digital credit marketplace.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Ulster’s research in reminding solutions has contributed novel findings in medication management workflow, mobile\-based video reminders for people with dementia and online training platforms for caregivers.  This research underpins the following impacts: 

 **I1** – Internet based product for managing the logging and dispensing of medication leading to 8 jobs, uptake by 150 users across 5 care homes and annual revenue of GBP1,200,000. 

 **I2** – Online training platform for carers of people with dementia with 80 individual licences and 13 group sales in 6 EU countries. 

 **I3** – Establishment of new policy guidelines for 45,000 Social Care Council staff in Northern Ireland and impacting the life and health sciences sector in Northern Ireland. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The increase in the number of people suffering from long term health conditions coupled with the rapid decline in the working population has led to predictions of a decrease in the number of healthcare professionals who will be available to offer healthcare provision in the future.  Taking this into consideration, new models of care delivery are required, in addition to the up\-skilling of untrained informal caregivers and volunteers who will be expected to deliver healthcare, in order to ensure that a continuum of care is provided to those in need. 

 Research led by Nugent within the Pervasive Computing Research Centre \(PCRC\) has had a focus on developing solutions to support stakeholders within a Connected Health environment for over 20 years. The research and main application areas have related to reminding technologies for medication management and supporting people with dementia and their caregivers which are linked to research **R1\-R6,** linked to impacts **I1\-I3** and evidenced in **\[C1\-C7\]**. 

 **R1\-R2** **Reminding technologies for medication management** 

 The initial work in this area stemmed from the EU FP5 MEDICATE Project \(2000\-2004\), where Ulster were Project co\-ordinators. The MEDICATE Project assessed stakeholder needs in the process of reminding technologies and established an Internet\-based care model to support all those involved in the supply\-to\-intake chain of personal medication management \[ **R1**\].  The MEDICATE solution was subsequently extended to a mobile\-based reminding application which inspired the concept of video\-based reminders for persons with dementia \[ **R2**\]. Through over 400 days of evaluations, the results from this research demonstrated the utility of the solution from both caregiver and patient perspectives. Two key areas were identified for future work: improving education for stakeholders using the technology, and challenges with technology adoption. 

 **R3\-R4** \- **Training for both formal and informal caregivers of persons with dementia** 

 Involvement in the EU LLP STAR Project \(2010\-2014\) permitted the PCRC to investigate the most appropriate digital strategies to support training for both formal and informal caregivers of persons with dementia \(Nugent and Paggetti\). A multilingual e\-learning tool was designed and developed, taking into consideration varying levels of training content, gamification and user interaction strategies for engagement. The portal was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with both informal caregivers and professional caregivers \(n=142\) in the Netherlands and the UK over a period of 4 months.  The results demonstrated a significant positive impact of the STAR training course on maintaining feelings of empathy among informal caregivers and volunteers.  It was also found that for professional caregivers, there was an improvement in empathy amongst those who followed the course.  In terms of usefulness and user friendliness, the tool was rated positively by all user groups \[ **R3**\]. 

 Research within the EU MSCA REMIND Project \(2017\-2020\), for which the PCRC are the project co\-ordinators \(Nugent and Cleland\), has permitted work to continue on how reminding technologies can be embedded within smart environments. This research has led to training initiatives for caregivers \[ **R4**\] \(Synnott and Nugent\) in addition to the delivery of 4 annual summer schools for early career researchers \[ **C4**\] \(Nugent,  Paggetti and Cleland\). 

 **R5\-R6 – Technology adoption models for persons with dementia** 

 To assist with engagement strategies and technology adoption, research was undertaken to develop a suite of technology adoption models \[ **R5**\] \(Nugent and Cleland\). Such models have been developed to predict the likelihood of a person with dementia adopting the technology. This work has been further extended to produce a set of recommendations to assist in the update of technology\-based solutions both for persons with dementia and their caregivers \[ **R6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **I1 Internet\-based product for managing the logging and dispensing of medication leading to 8 jobs, uptake by 150 users across 5 care homes and annual revenue of GBP1,200,000.** \[ **R1, R2, R5**\] 

 \[text removed for publication\], a pharmacy automation business based in \[text removed for publication\], Northern Ireland \(NI\), has taken the findings from our research and created a new internet\-based product for the management of their medication provision in care home settings. In 2016 the company wished to expand its operations into the domiciliary care market, but did not have the experience nor the technology expertise to do so \[ **C1**\]. Through its engagement with the PCRC, the research findings and workflow management through an internet care model from the MEDICATE Project \[ **R1**\] and mobile medication solution \[ **R2**\] were used to create the design of a new mobile internet\-based solution for tracking and managing medication sachets within care home settings. Findings from the digitisation of workflow management in the medication process \[ **R1, R2**\] in addition to approaches to improve technology adoption \[ **R5**\] were incorporated into the solution. \[text removed for publication\] subsequently leveraged funding to realise the product and in 2019 launched its new product offering, \[text removed for publication\]. This is now being used in 5 care homes across NI to support approximately 150 users. Since engaging with PCRC, \[text removed for publication\] has grown its team from \[text removed for publication\] to \[text removed for publication\] \(representing an increase in headcount of \[text removed for publication\]\).  The company has since entered a new market of medication management in care homes and has increased its annual revenue from \[text removed for publication\] in 2016 to \[text removed for publication\] in 2020 \[ **C2**\]. Improvements have been found from both patient and healthcare professional perspectives as evidenced in documented testimonials \[ **C7**\].  The manager of Inspire Supported Living Care Home said that in using the automated processes of \[text removed for publication\] “ *it is a simplistic system*” which has “ *drastically reduced our timeframe*” for managing medication within the care home \[ **C7**\]. Families using the solution have advocated that it assists with managing complex medication regimes and that “ *there is absolutely no confusion as to what that medication is*”. Users of the solution who previously had been challenged with the complexity of their medication regime have reported that “ *it has given me peace of mind*” \[ **C7**\]. 

 **I2 Online training platform for carers of people with dementia with 80 individual licences and 13 group sales in 6 EU countries.** \[ **R3**\] 

 Through involvement in the EU STAR Project and evaluation of the findings from the randomised control trial conducted by the consortium \[ **R3**\], PCRC joined with members of the consortium to develop a multi\-lingual online training portal, the ‘STAR Training Portal’. Since 2015, the portal \( [www.stratraining.eu](http://www.stratraining.eu/)\) has generated 13 group sales and 80 individual licences in 6 EU countries UK, Netherlands, Romania, Italy, Malta and Sweden. The ambition was to deliver a low cost and affordable solution to support carers of people with dementia \(25 Euros per user\). Profits are split between partners within the original STAR consortium on a pro\-rata basis aligned with the original Project funding and in accordance with a Joint Ownership and Collaboration Agreement **\[C3\]**. 

 **I3 Establishment of new policy guidelines for 45,000 Social Care Council staff in Northern Ireland and impacting the life and health sciences sector in Northern Ireland.** \[ **R2, R4, R6**\] 

 Through extensive research on caring solutions and technology driven care models the PCRC has engaged with a number of agencies and initiatives to deliver impact across a broad range of care based training, policy development and advisory initiatives that have informed roadmaps for delivering connected health products and services for caregivers including:\- 

-  Northern Ireland Social Care Council \(2018\-2019\) 

-  Connected Health Summer School \(CHSS\) \(2016\-2019\) 

-  International Federation of Ageing 

-  MATRIX Life and Health Sciences NI 

-  The Health Innovation Research Alliance Northern Ireland \(HIRANI\) 

 The PCRC has worked with the **Northern Ireland Social Care Council** \(2018\-2019\) to assist it in understanding and developing its digital capability for its 45,000 registered staff who deliver social work and social care services in Northern Ireland \[ **C5**\]. The development of the council’s digital skills for social care strategy has been based on the collection and analysis of staff feedback undertaken by PCRC \[ **R4**\]\[ **C6**\].  This has resulted in an increase of 50% in users engaging with the council’s online learning zone for the promotion of technology within the workplace \[ **C5**\]. 

 The PCRC has raised awareness of the use of technology for reminding purposes, to support persons with dementia and in general healthcare provision in a number of settings \[ **R2, R6**\].  Through the **Connected Health Summer School \(CHSS\)**, which annually presents the research results from the REMIND consortium, the PCRC has co\-organised and delivered the event over the last 4 years \(2016\-2019\) to technologists, clinicians and industry practitioners \[ **C4**\]. In a post event assessment to determine the benefits of the CHSS, all respondents stated that the summer school would have an impact on their future careers; and, that improvements in knowledge across technical, health and business domains were achieved \[ **C4**\]. One industry participant stated the “ *summer school has been an amazing experience. Both from a personal and from a professional development perspective. The direct contact with the problem owners offers a clear and full perspective of their needs and wishes. It also allows for direct, well\-nuanced feedback of any solution direction that is being considered. The offer of both technical and health care oriented sessions show the full breadth of the potential solutions, allowing participants to look beyond their own discipline.  Professionally, I have benefited greatly in my development. Hoping to contribute to the medical technology field, I am now organizing a boot camp in the Medical Device Regulation \(MDR\) for the second year in a row. In this boot camp, we bring medical technology companies, start\-ups and students together to test specific use cases for compliance with the MDR.”* 

 Based on a general appreciation for the expertise acquired by the PCRC from research in the area of technology\-based solutions for care provision, Prof Nugent was invited to join a panel of technology experts by the **International Federation of Ageing** to produce the ‘Reablement and Older People’ guidelines for the design and implementation of technology driven care models \[ **C8**\]. 

 Prof Nugent was also invited to join the MATRIX Northern Ireland Science Industry Panel, a business led expert panel, formed primarily to advise government, industry and academia on the commercial exploitation of R&D and science and technology in Northern Ireland. The Chair of the MATRIX Panel stated that Prof Nugent was appointed to the panel *“based on his research and academic track record and that he was a valuable member of the panel and that his research helped to inform the content of the report and shaped the recommendations”* \[ **C9**\]. 

 The expert panel published the **MATRIX Life and Health Sciences NI** ‘Capability Assessment and Foresight Report’ in 2015. MATRIX commissions research, analysis and studies to build an evidence base for future science and R&D policies in Northern Ireland.  One of its objectives is to ‘identify, agree and oversee a programme of market led science and technology Foresight studies’. The report outlined recommendations to government highlighting the need \(amongst others\) for the further training of healthcare professionals and in terms of clear leadership and co\-ordination the report highlighted *“the importance of building a committed, visible leadership and co\-ordination capability for the sector. A facility whereby decision makers within industry, academia and government meet to make decisions for Northern Ireland would dramatically progress this issue”* **\[C9\]** *.* Following recommendations from the report in 2019 Invest Northern Ireland have funded the establishment of **The Health Innovation Research Alliance Northern Ireland \(HIRANI\)** an alliance of universities, health organisations and other industry bodies, established to drive and support ambitious growth in Northern Ireland’s Life & Health Sciences sector. The Chair of the MATRIX Panel stated *“The recommendations from the Matrix report absolutely led to the establishment of HIRANI as a vehicle to coordinate and lead the life and health sciences sector in NI. Moreover, the recommendations also formed the basis of Invest NI’s life science sector strategy informing areas of sectoral strength and approaches that might support business growth and expansion in the sector”.* Research by the Fraser of Allander Institute in 2020 revealed that the life science sector in Northern Ireland is thriving, supporting 18,000 full\-time jobs throughout Northern Ireland.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Solent research has impacted on the public understanding of one of the world’s best loved, and often misunderstood, writers. At a time when Agatha Christie’s writing is more popular than ever \- as demonstrated by on\-going film and television productions from the BBC, Amazon, Disney and 20<sup>th</sup> Century Fox \- this impact case study shows how the research has impacted and informed public discourse/understanding concerning these works. This impact is a direct result of Dr Aldridge’s status as a research specialist, advisor and contributor to those working on Agatha Christie projects. Dr Aldridge assists and advises on public events and both creates and engages with a significant amount of international discussion of Agatha Christie \(in particular screen adaptations of her work\) through his talks, interviews, and a new mainstream research\-based publication which forms a centrepiece of the official celebrations marking a century since the publication of Christie’s first book. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Mark Aldridge \(Senior Lecturer at Solent University, 2007\-present\) first published research on Agatha Christie in 2012. Research into film and television adaptations of Agatha Christie then led to his first monograph *Agatha Christie on Screen*, published in 2016 by Palgrave Macmillan. This original research was extensively based on archival material, principally that held by international archives at the University of Exeter, Margaret Herrick Archive \(Los Angeles\), Library of Congress \(Washington DC\) and the Agatha Christie family’s own collection. The book was very well received, including by the foremost journal covering this area, *The Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television*, but also readers of Agatha Christie, as well as both Agatha Christie Ltd. and the Christie estate. This inspired further research and the writing of a second book that would appeal to a mainstream readership as well as scholars. 

 Having established a good relationship with Agatha Christie Ltd and the Agatha Christie family \(principally her only grandchild, Mathew Prichard, retired chair of Agatha Christie Ltd.\), Dr Aldridge has continued to undertake and disseminate research, with a special emphasis on archival material that has received little or no attention. He is often called upon to speak to the media or participate in public events that discuss and celebrate Christie, as he is the main expert internationally when it comes to adaptations of her work. Following the success of the first monograph, several opportunities arose for Dr Aldridge to continue his work and share the results of his research. 

 As a result of these speaking and publishing opportunities, Dr Aldridge has built a reputation as an expert, enabling him to undertake and disseminate further research. This has included creating, delivering and chairing talks at a variety of events, and writing an introduction to the reissue of a Christie\-related book \( *The Passing of Mr Quinn*\) that Christie’s publisher, HarperCollins, had been unaware of before Dr Aldridge discussed its significance during an event they attended. This working relationship led to an even more significant commission from HarperCollins for a new ‘official’ book for a mainstream audience published to coincide with one hundred years of Christie’s detective Poirot. Dr Aldridge’s book, *Agatha Christie’s Poirot: The Greatest Detective in the World,* packages the original research that he has undertaken, including a wealth of unpublished material, into a book appropriate for a wide readership. During the course of the research its scope was expanded due to full access to the archives of HarperCollins, where much material about and by Christie resides, given that it has been her publisher since 1926. The result coincided with the detective’s centenary, and Kenneth Branagh’s second \(subsequently postponed\) Poirot film, *Death on the Nile*. This book is officially licensed by both Agatha Christie Ltd. and the Christie family trust, which has helped it gain good exposure in the publicity surrounding these events, and is the official publication for the celebrations. Early feedback has been extremely positive \(4.7/5 on amazon.co.uk\) and has inspired a great deal of interest in Dr Aldridge’s research.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact on understanding and appreciation of Christie’s works** 

 Although conceived and executed as a research monograph, Dr Aldridge’s book *Agatha Christie on Screen* \(2016\) has received acclaim from Christie fans and the wider public, as well as scholars. It has garnered positive reviews from both the public \(4.5/5 on amazon.co.uk\) and from critics which show how the book has impacted on appreciation and understanding of Christie’s work: 

-  “Whether established scholar, student or general reader, there is something included in this book for everyone \[. . . . \] it is an excellent example of how to balance scholarship with accessibility for both academic and general readers.” Llewella Chapman, *Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television* \[5.4\] 

-  “Mark Aldridge, with his unique access to Christie archives, has unearthed a treasure trove of details that make Agatha Christie more alive to me than before.” Amazon reviewer \[5.2\]. 

-  “\[Aldridge\] introduced me to a number of productions I was not aware of and he has also given me a strong need to watch more of Christie’s stage productions. It was great to see behind the scenes of adaptations and to see what went into making them and I have a much greater idea of what the adapting process is like.” *Cross Examining Crime* \[5.3\]. 

 Newspapers and magazines have frequently contacted Dr Aldridge to discuss the book and interview him about new Agatha Christie adaptations. This has led to appearances in *The New York Times, The Times* \(which branded Dr Aldridge ‘the Agathologist’\) *, The Independent, The Sunday Times* and the *Radio Times* \(amongst other publications\) as well as popular websites such as *Digital Spy*, where his research has been explicitly referenced and he has been quoted or interviewed. Additionally, he has written an article for the *Daily Mail*’s *Weekend* magazine \(the most widely read magazine in the country\) about the history of Poirot, designed to coincide with the release of the new *Death on the Nile* film. This is a clear demonstration that the work he has been undertaking helps to inform popular discourse about her work, and his research has had a meaningful impact on such discussions \[5.5\]. 

 Dr Aldridge appeared on television for a discussion of *Murder on the Orient Express* on the channel TRT World in 2017 \[5.6\], which was broadcast in 190 countries, in the 2017 Sky documentary *Agatha Christie: Murder Beyond the Orient Express* \[5.7\], and the 2019 French documentary *Le crime en heritage: Agatha Christie crève l'écran*. Most recently he was interviewed for the 2020 PBS/Channel 5 \(US/UK\) documentaries *Agatha Christie: 100 Years of Poirot and Miss Marple* and *Agatha Christie’s England,* and has shared his research with Stephen Fry for a forthcoming appearance as expert and interviewer in a major ITV documentary \(2021\). 

 On the radio, Dr Aldridge is a regular contributor to BBC Radio Devon \(which covers the area where Christie lived for most of her life\), discussing new events and Christie’s impact, including in relation to World Book Day celebrations \[5.1\]. Dr Aldridge has been a special guest for the American podcast *All About Agatha* three times, which has a global audience of over 100,000 ‘listens’ every month. These episodes were discussing screen adaptations of Christie’s work, coinciding with the release of *Murder on the Orient Express* and then their discussion of Christie’s masterpiece *And Then There Were None* and Dr Aldridge’s Poirot book \[5.8\]. Interest has only accelerated recently, with interviews for a range of popular international podcasts including *A Dark and Stormy Podcast* \(US\) and *Shedunnit* \(UK\). 

 Dr Aldridge brings his research insights directly to audiences through public talks aimed at general audiences. At the *International Agatha Christie Festival*, in Torquay in September 2017, he presented a discussion of some lesser\-known Christie film adaptations to a sold out audience \[5.9\]. He was invited to speak at Torquay Museum’s *Christie Mystery Day* in September 2018 and he gave a special introduction to the first British cinema appearance of the film *Crooked House* in September 2019. Since then he has given five more invited talks to audiences and has proven to be an in\-demand authority on Christie’s works, with feedback indicating that he is a popular and entertaining presenter who helps to bring his research to life for the general public \[5.12\]. Dr Aldridge has worked with the organisers of the *International Festival* for several years, including assisting with events and chairing a meeting between the board at the request of Christie’s grandson. His online talk for the 2020 *International Agatha Christie Festival* has attracted over 2000 views to date \(the highest number of the whole event\), showing the extent of interest into his research. 

 In 2018, Dr Aldridge was invited to take part in the *Killer Women* literary festival, where he discussed Agatha Christie and Poirot on stage with internationally best\-selling author Sophie Hannah, who also writes the official Poirot continuation novels, while in 2019 he gave a talk at the National Trust’s inaugural *Greenway Literary Festival*, which took place at Christie’s holiday home in Devon \[5.10\]. Following this Greenway appearance, Dr Aldridge was invited to become a member of Literature Works, an organisation supported by Arts Council England that helps established authors to support and mentor those honing their craft in the South West of England \[5.13\]. Despite the pandemic, Dr Aldridge took part in many invited literary/film and public events in 2020, including sell\-out appearances at literary festivals such as *Noirwich* and *Perfect Crime*. 

 These extensive appearances in the media and on the literary scene demonstrate the value of this research to those seeking to enjoy and interpret Christie’s work and understand her ongoing cultural significance. 

 **Impact on the Christie archives and estate** 

 Dr Aldridge enjoys a good relationship with her publisher HarperCollins and the family trust, who consult with him to clarify details when preparing press releases and similar publicity materials, for example he was asked consulted on the announcement of the BBC adaptation of *And Then There Were None* in 2015 \[5.1\]. His work has led to the return to the archives of a Poirot television production, *Murder by the Book* \[5.11\], the master tape of which had been destroyed by Disney, and the discovery of a unique filmed record of an original run of one of her stage plays in the 1950s \[5.1\]. 

 **Further impact** 

 The impact that Dr Aldridge has made on wider understanding of Agatha Christie is showcased by the 2020 publication of *Agatha Christie’s Poirot:* *The Greatest Detective in the World*. This book was commissioned following discussions between Dr Aldridge and Christie’s publisher HarperCollins regarding his desire to bring his new research to a wide audience. This was especially apparent following Dr Aldridge’s public talks which showed that there was a widespread appetite for new information and interpretation regarding Christie, which in turn leads to greater understanding of her work and her own impact. The result is a lavishly illustrated examination of her most famous detective, which shares insights and new discoveries in an accessible way, while always being based on rigorous research that has been shared with other Christie scholars, who have also reviewed the text before publication. Although it is early days for the book, it has been very well received and the book has already been picked up for distribution internationally, including translations into Greek and Estonian. International interest is no doubt the result of the fact that Christie herself continues to sell extremely well – for example, on the paperback bestsellers chart *Murder on the Orient Express* climbed to number two following the Branagh film. Dr Aldridge’s work has placed him at the forefront of popular and academic international discussions about Agatha Christie and her enduring legacy.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Robinson’s research underpins an innovative approach to heritage at the Theatre Royal Nottingham and other cultural institutions in the East Midlands, addressing historic underfunding in the regional arts with a new model of ‘Citizen Scholarship’. This model has transformed organisational culture, practice and capacity at the Theatre Royal through upskilling 60 volunteers to co\-research and co\-curate analogue and digital collections, and has inspired new routes to share the Theatre’s 150\-year history with new local audiences and digital audiences worldwide. ‘Citizen Scholarship’ projects have been adopted at Bromley House Library, Southwell Workhouse and Derby Theatre, with Robinson’s model used as exemplary practice. The project has: i\) changed organisational culture, practice, and capacity at the Theatre Royal to enhance cultural heritage preservation; ii\) changed cultural engagement strategies and embedded sustainable practices across the city and region; iii\) empowered volunteers and their communities by enhancing volunteer skills, knowledge and wellbeing, and increasing audience engagement and public understanding of cultural history. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Robinson’s research on regional theatres demonstrates the importance of local/regional theatre histories in addressing a ‘gap’ in British theatre research, where London is often a stand in for ‘British’ theatre \( **1**, **5**, **6**\). Her development of innovative and collaborative digital humanities approaches enables both cutting edge research *and* participatory engagement with theatre histories by wider public audiences \( **2**, **3**, **4**\), and is addressing both a current and historical lack in capacity and funding in the East Midlands heritage sector \( **3**\). 

 The underpinning research began in 2003, with AHRC funding in 2006\-09 for ‘Mapping Performance Culture: Nottingham 1857\-67’ \(PI Robinson, English; Co-I Priestnall, Geography\) \( **F1**\). This project involved the collaborative development of an open\-source interactive digital map that enabled users to explore and analyse the performance culture of mid\-nineteenth\-century Nottingham \( **4**\). The theory and scope of the project is set out in a foundational article published in 2004 \( **5**\). Here Robinson argues that mapping as an approach enables the innovative linking of historical data on performance culture to produce an ‘intertheatrical’ \(Bratton, 2001\) perspective on performance and spectatorship, illuminating audience experience across the cultural landscape of Nottingham. ‘Mapping Performance Culture’ pioneered this methodology by combining a large data set collected from local archives, museums, and libraries with GIS \(geographical information systems\) technology: an analysis of the technical innovations of the project appeared in 2011 \( **2**\). Robinson argues \( **2**\) that open\-source digital mapping offers a way to address patterns of connectivity and change across both time and space, capturing and representing the interlinked stories mobilised in the making and reception of theatrical performance \( **4**\); she also highlights the site’s ability to connect and make accessible to audiences resources from different archives and sources. 

 The period covered by ‘Mapping Performance Culture’ included the construction and opening of Nottingham’s Theatre Royal in 1865; an article on the history of pantomime at the venue \( **6**\) used the mapping approach of the project to draw together evidence from playbills, transport schedules, adverts and reviews in order to synthesise new understandings of local relationships between theatre and audiences. 

 In 2015, the Theatre proposed a research collaboration focused on developing new ways of using digital and participatory methods to explore and share the Theatre’s heritage \( **b**\). Robinson \(with Carletti \(UoN Horizon\)\) developed a new ‘Citizen Scholarship’ strategy for preserving, curating and sharing the Theatre’s heritage. This strategy underpinned a successful Heritage Lottery Fund bid for a two\-year collaborative ‘Our Theatre Royal Nottingham’ project \(Feb 2017 – Apr 2019\) \( **F2**\). The researchers worked alongside and supported skills development of ‘Citizen Scholar’ volunteers to co\-research and co\-curate the Theatre Royal’s history through: i\) the sorting and cataloguing of the analogue archive of materials held by the Theatre and not currently accessible to the public; ii\) collection and editing of oral histories from key figures in the venue’s story; iii\) research across different repositories in the city; iv\) the creation and curation of a freely accessible digital collection that links together objects from these various elements to enable users to make their own connections and narratives; v\) development of talks and exhibitions to share the findings with the local public. This research approach and its outcomes are published in Robinson and Carletti’s 2019 article \( **3**\), which highlights the transferability of the approach to other organisations for enhanced and sustainable cultural heritage preservation and engagement. 

 In 2017, Robinson obtained AHRC funding for ‘Citizen Scholarship in Nottingham’ \(follow on project from ‘Mapping Performance Culture’\) in order to test, develop, and implement this ‘Citizen Scholarship’ model of cultural heritage in the wider region. Robinson has set up pilot projects at Bromley House Library, Southwell Workhouse, and Derby Theatre \( **F3**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The East Midlands is rich in cultural heritage, but is a region that has had to contend with historic underfunding in the arts \( **a**\). In Nottingham, the Theatre Royal, built in 1865, is a keystone of the city’s living heritage, but as a council\-run performance venue it has ‘ *had limited resources, in terms of both time and capacity*’ \( **c**, **p. 4**\) for managing and understanding its archive and heritage. Building on ‘Mapping Performance Culture’ \( **2**, **4**\- **6**\), praised by AHRC reviewers as demonstrating ‘ *how new technology can be used to make research available to the local community, while at the same time integrating local resources and exploiting their holdings*’, Robinson has worked with the Theatre to develop methodologically innovative ways to better understand, manage, and promote their history and increase audience participation with their cultural heritage \( **3**\) \( **b**\). That success underpinned the development of a sustainable model of ‘Citizen Scholarship’ for cultural engagement, which has changed strategy and practice across the city and region \( **g**\- **j**\). The project produced the following key impacts: 

####  i\) Changing organisational culture, practice, and capacity at the Theatre Royal to enhance cultural heritage preservation 

 Before Robinson’s project, the Theatre’s archive was ‘ *poorly managed with no systems in place for cataloguing material*’; its holdings were inaccessible to the public, grew through ‘ *\[o\]ccasional archive donations*’ only, and were not connected to other archival holdings in the city \( **c**, **p. 6**\). Because ‘ *the use of volunteers was not deemed \[worth\] pursuing or even necessary*’ by the Theatre \( **c**, **p. 5**\), the venue ‘ *had no experience of working with volunteers*’ \( **b**\) and thus lacked capacity to explore and utilise its heritage. Robinson’s ‘Citizen Scholarship’ model of heritage engagement \( **3**\) overcame these weaknesses in the following key ways. 

 First, Robinson’s ‘Citizen Scholarship’ model \( **3**\) transformed the venue’s operational capacity and ethos ‘ *to embrace volunteer\-led heritage and engagement practices*’ \( **b**\). At the start of the HLF project in February 2017, 60 volunteers were recruited \(against a target of 30\), trained and supported by Robinson and experts from UoN and the East Midlands Oral History Archive to develop skills in areas from archival practice to archive research and oral history, as well as curating and hosting foyer exhibitions and sell\-out events to disseminate findings to the wider public. To date, volunteer work has enabled organisation and cataloguing of over 4,500 items, 39 interviews have been recorded \(with 45 participants\) \( **c**, **pp. 6, 9**\), and 1,316 archival items and 241 oral history clips have been uploaded to the digital archive \( **b**\). According to the Theatre, this undertaking ‘ *would not have been possible without the Citizen Scholarship model*’, which has provided the Theatre with a ‘ *skilled archive team*’ and ‘ *a professional heritage management system*’ \( **b**\). Volunteers are now integral to the organisation and are building capacity beyond the archive; some have received further training to assist with backstage tours and outreach talks, and others are countering short\-staffing at large public events \( **b**\). The Theatre describes this organisational change as a ‘ *fantastic outcome \[that\] was not anticipated and is a direct result of implementing Professor Robinson’s Citizen Scholarship model*’, emphasising that Robinson’s ‘ *expert advice*’ and specialist connections ‘ *made the management and training of these volunteers possible*’ \( **b**\). 

 Second, Robinson’s digital humanities approach to performance culture \( **2**\- **4**\) drew together resources from across the city and beyond, encouraging volunteer researchers – empowered as co\-curators – to develop their own research interests and tell their own stories about the objects and images chosen for sharing on a new digital platform developed with support from Robinson and UoN \( [ourtheatreroyal.org](https://ourtheatreroyal.org/s/default/page/home)\). This story\-based approach developed by Robinson \( **3**\) is acknowledged as being ‘ *\[k\]ey to the platform’s success*’ as ‘ *an accessible resource shaped by collaborative storytelling*’ \( **b**\). Other volunteers worked with Robinson’s colleagues from UoN Horizon to develop and test the user interface of this new site. The Theatre describes Robinson’s ‘ *research on theatre performance history, her experience of running heritage projects, her expertise in “citizen scholarship”, and her ability to put us into conversation with groups with digital skills*’ as being ‘ *core*’ to the development of the heritage project and in turn the Theatre’s ability to manage and preserve its heritage collections \( **b**\). 

 Robinson’s model \( **3**\) has directly informed the Theatre’s ‘ *strategic plans to restructure the venue and improve the sustainability of \[its\] heritage practices*’ \( **b**\). Robinson is academic partner on the Theatre’s successful follow\-on Heritage Fund bid \(Feb 2020 – present\) \( **F4**\), which has enabled ‘ *a brand new post of TRCH Heritage Coordinator*’, with responsibility for leading on, developing and delivering all aspects of the venue’s heritage work, and playing a key role in embedding heritage and archival work across the organisation \( **e**, **p. 12**\) \(appointment delayed due to Covid\-19\). Other decisions enabled by this successful bid include transforming the current archive room into a fully functional ‘ *heritage workspace*’, with the archive moving to UoN Manuscripts and Special Collections \( **e**, **p. 15**\), and delivering on focused ambitions to engage more diverse audiences with its heritage, including children, young people under 25 and minority groups in Nottingham \( **e**, **pp. 5, 14\-16**; **b**\). According to the Theatre, these are ‘ *exciting opportunities that have come directly out of embedding Professor Robinson’s model of Citizen Scholarship at the Theatre*’ \( **b**\). 

####  ii\) Changing cultural engagement strategies and embedding sustainable practices across the city and region 

 The Theatre Royal project has directly influenced the development of Nottingham City Council’s Heritage Strategy 2015\-30, providing a pathway for achieving their aims to ‘ *\[b\]roaden \[...\] understanding of the city’s historic environment*’ \( **f1**, **p. 19**\) through generating ‘ *\[h\]ighly accessible information about the city’s heritage, available in both traditional and technologically pioneering ways*’ \( **f2**, **p. 3**\). In July 2018 Robinson became a strategic partner on the Council’s successful Heritage Lottery Fund bid to support development of their Heritage Partnership project. The Council acknowledge that they ‘ *lacked a digital strategy for promoting public participation in heritage*’ prior to their collaboration with Robinson, and that Robinson’s research ‘ *helped shape our digital strategy for delivering the Partnership*’ while the ‘ *“storytelling” methodology \(Robinson 2019: 133\) used in the Theatre Royal digital archive has particularly inspired our strategic thinking on driving participation*’ \( **g**\). Robinson leads on the ‘Digital Aspirations’ strand of the Partnership, embedding the use of technology to better engage and connect Nottingham’s diverse communities \(subject to Covid\-19 delays\) \( **g**\). 

 Robinson’s AHRC\-funded ‘Citizen Scholarship in Nottingham’ project \( **F3**\) built on the HLF\-supported ‘Our Theatre Royal Nottingham’ project \( **F2**\) \( **3**\) to develop a sustainable model of archive development and volunteer engagement, with support from Nottingham UNESCO City of Literature. Following regional framework ‘Citizen Scholarship’ workshops, Robinson began trial projects at Bromley House Library and Southwell Workhouse \(both paused due to Covid\-19; evidence from Southwell Workhouse unobtainable due to staff furlough\). According to Bromley House, ‘ *Professor Robinson’s Citizen Scholarship model has enabled us to evaluate our current volunteer practice and has transformed our understanding of how to manage our volunteers and produce relevant and engaging research content*’ \( **i**\). The Library’s staff and volunteers have also benefited from ‘ *valuable digital skills and knowledge*’ gained through workshops delivered by Robinson and UoN Horizon colleagues \(Jun and Nov 2019\), and digital technologies are now being used to bring the Library’s heritage ‘ *to wider audiences*’: ‘ *Users can now visit our website and take a 3D tour of the Library’s attics prior to renovation, thereby gaining access to a part of our history that would otherwise have been lost forever*’ \( **i**\). As Nottingham UNESCO City of Literature comments, ‘ *the model has provided an important shared learning opportunity across our city’s cultural organisations and has empowered them to design engagement activities to diversify their audiences and evaluate their impact. The research has led directly to better preservation, better presentation and increased capacity for management and utilisation of cultural and literary heritage in Nottingham at large*’ \( **h**\). 

 While the AHRC Citizen Scholarship project \( **F3**\) targeted Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, Robinson also shared the model in the wider East Midlands, after a request from Derby Theatre to help develop a community\-driven archive \( **j2**\). She co\-delivered two workshops \(Jan and Apr 2019\) with the Theatre Royal, helping Derby Theatre to embed ‘Citizen Scholarship’ as ‘ *a key mechanism \[…\] for community participation and knowledge exchange*’ \( **j1**\). Derby Theatre emphasises that Robinson’s ‘storytelling’ methodology is ‘ *a key part of the theatre’s strategy for increasing and diversifying community engagement*’ as it enables people to take ‘ *ownership of \[…\] their city’s cultural heritage*’ \( **j1**\). Robinson’s model now underpins one of Derby Theatre’s strategic objectives: *‘To support a sustainable and accessible theatre archive through a co\-curated, “citizen scholar” approach’*, sustaining their mission to ‘ *provide increased opportunities for currently underrepresented communities*’ \( **j1**\). 

 A ‘Citizen Scholarship’ website \( [citizenscholar.org.uk](https://www.citizenscholar.org.uk/)\), with exemplar case studies, guidance on pilot projects, and advice on tools and resources, is available to support organisations. 

####  iii\) Empowering volunteers and their communities by i\) enhancing volunteer skills, knowledge and wellbeing and ii\) increasing audience engagement and public understanding of cultural history 

 Nottingham City Council note that Robinson’s ‘ *story\-based approach offers us a practical way of bringing the city together and enabling people – members of the public and local communities, not just organisations or institutions – to take ownership of the city’s heritage by connecting their own personal stories to wider stories in the city and region*’ \( **g**\). Success in empowering citizens \( **3**\) is evidenced in the experiences of the original Theatre Royal project volunteers. The majority selected had little or no heritage experience, and therefore benefited from gaining new skills and knowledge. As the Theatre Royal notes, ‘ *as trained citizen scholars, our volunteers have grown into confident, skilled, and knowledgeable researchers and archivists*’ \( **b**\), and ‘ *have also become Theatre Royal experts gaining detailed knowledge of past shows, performers and other essential facts*’ \( **c**, **p. 4**\) *.* The volunteers cite the transformational benefits of being competent citizen scholars actively curating the city’s heritage: ‘ *We have a value, a role*’; ‘ *the satisfaction when you complete something*’; ‘ *pride not only in your own achievement, but pride in the products, the achievement of it, the fact that we are contributing to something which is positive about the place that we live in*’ \( **d**, **pp. 11\-12**\). The community\-based element of the project also had positive effects on the volunteers’ mental and social wellbeing; as the Theatre notes, ‘ *\[t\]hrough working in their various project teams, volunteer well\-being has come to the fore, with strong friendships being formed and other social activities taking place, such as volunteer lunches and theatre trips*’ \( **c**, **p. 5**\). 

 The project has also generated increased audience engagement with the Theatre’s new story\-based approach to heritage \( **3**\). The project’s public engagement programme in 2017\-18 was hugely popular, with 96% take\-up for the heritage talks and approximately 520 visitors to the Heritage Open Day \( **c**, **p. 14**\). Since its launch on 23 October 2018, the digital archive has had 8,500 visitors from 76 countries worldwide, with over 60% of users interacting with the newly discoverable archive collections \( **b**\). The digital archive is now central to the Theatre Royal’s social media strategy, providing ‘ *fresh images and stories*’ to ‘ *expand our audiences and help build our social media followers*’; with posts generating ‘ *phenomenal statistics*’ of engagement \(e.g. 1,130 interactions and 12,000 views for a single post\) \( **b**\). 

 According to Nottingham UNESCO City of Literature, Robinson’s model of ‘Citizen Scholarship’ \( **3**\) has ‘ *increased the understanding and appreciation of literary cultural heritage among the public in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire and has led to the creation of new audiences, fostering curiosity and engagement. Robinson’s work has led to widening the literary and cultural offer in the city of Nottingham and provides strategies for increasing the demographic inclusivity of that offer, including the age range and ethnicity of the participants*’ \( **h**\). In Derbyshire, Derby Theatre have already used the ‘ *“co\-creation” and “co\-curation” elements*’ of the model as a basis for involving the community ‘ *from the early planning stages of the archive project*’ \( **j1**\), and Nottingham City Council sum up Robinson’s model as ‘ *ground\-breaking in terms of developing citizen participation within heritage and culture*’ \( **g**\).

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Strathclyde research has been crucial in creating new methods and technologies for industrial pharmaceutical process development associated with continuous manufacturing and crystallisation \(CMAC\) generating impacts across the UK and international technology and pharmaceutical sectors. This has led to new product lines being developed \(Alconbury Weston Ltd\), and documented savings in development studies \(Lilly\) that have gone on to inform commercial manufacturing \(AstraZeneca\). Since August 2013, approximately GBP45,000,000 of savings and improvements have been realised by the 22 multinational and Small and Medium\-sized Enterprises \(SMEs\) who have invested directly in proprietary analytical and process improvement projects.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 The EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing \(CIM\) in Continuous Manufacturing and Crystallisation \(CMAC\) was established at the University of Strathclyde in 2011, based on the joint research and expertise of Florence \(A3\) and Sefcik \(B12\). Now an EPSRC Future Manufacturing Research Hub, CMAC undertakes demand\-led manufacturing research in partnership with six universities, eight multinational pharmaceutical companies \(AstraZeneca \(AZ\), Bayer, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline \(GSK\), Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Takeda\) and 18 equipment, analytical, software and consultancy companies. 

 CMAC research is conducted by a multi\-disciplinary team from Strathclyde’s Science and Engineering Faculties to generate a critical\-mass ecosystem for advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing research. The development of small scale, modular, agile and flexible continuous manufacturing processes for medicines is essential to meet the rapidly changing demands of modern healthcare. This has never been more evident than in the essential medicines shortages resulting from international supply chain disruption in the ongoing COVID\-19 pandemic. 

 The underpinning research spans understanding of particle formation, continuous processes, advanced technology and innovative digital solutions. Important contributions from Florence, Brown, Ter Horst, Halbert and Johnston among others in the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences have been made to research on: 

 **Particles \- Exquisite control of particle quality attributes:** Controlling the formation of particles is crucial to realising improved manufacturability, performance and stability demanded by robust, sustainable and cost effective medicines manufacture. Understanding how key particle attributes can be better controlled using advanced process technologies and exploiting this knowledge to streamline the final production of formulated products is vital to ensure medicines can be made with greater control and lower cost. Examples include the development of an advanced process control system jointly developed with CMAC, an SME \(Perceptive Engineering\) and AZ. This project delivered methods to directly control particle size, size distribution and significantly improve process yield \(26% higher than corresponding batch process\), improving productivity and reducing off\-spec product and waste \[ **R1**\]. In addition, extensive characterisation of plug flow reactors coupled with supersaturation and seeding control enabled control over polymorphic form and unwanted nucleation and encrustation during continuous crystallisation \[ **R2**\]. 

 **Processes \- Smart workflows for accelerated development of particle formation processes:** CMAC research has focussed extensively on the development of robust, scalable workflow processes for continuous crystallisation and drug product processes to enhance process understanding, avoid common failure modes and deliver consistent, high quality products. Several examples have been developed building a comprehensive and rigorous framework for advanced process development that support regulatory requirements such as the US Food and Drug Administration’s Quality by Design guidance. An extensive multidisciplinary project developed the first major comprehensive workflow for continuous cooling crystallisation as a key outcome from the EPSRC CIM \[ **R3**\]. This system\-wide view of the crystallisation process coupled scaled down experiments, prediction and multi\-scale modelling to deliver robust process design and operation to achieve exquisite control of product attributes and quality. Workflows have also been published for anti\-solvent crystallisation, impurity rejection in crystallisation \[ **R4**\], spherical agglomeration, wash solvent selection in filtration washing and drying, determination of solubility of materials in polymeric systems and manufacturability of formulated products. 

 **Technologies \- Advanced continuous platform technology development:** CMAC has provided fundamental science to design and develop novel processing equipment, or microfactories, to broaden the applicability and benefits of continuous processing. These platforms include: Novel Nucleator Platform; mixed suspension mixer product removal crystalliser with Digital Twin; meso\-scale, moving liquid Continuous Oscillatory Baffled Crystalliser \[ **R1**, **R2**\], in line mixers for rapid antisolvent crystallisation and a moving baffle oscillatory baffled reactor cascade. 

 **Digital Design:** Manufacturing research spans many length scales from molecular to process and bulk materials. CMAC research has included the development of Machine Learning models to predict the formation of novel solvates and crystallisability thereby creating novel predictive tools to inform and accelerate development. Molecular dynamics and atomic force microscopy \(AFM\) has informed new understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of crystal formation \[ **R5**\]. In addition, digital design tools for formulated product manufacture via direct compression provide new tools to accelerate development using predictive modelling approaches \[ **R6**\]. The role of data science is key and CMAC has developed a database of common excipients to support rapid screening of formulation options in\-silico, saving time as well as associated material use.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Through the establishment, growth and global influence of CMAC, Strathclyde’s demand\-led research and expertise in forming particles with controlled attributes, in workflow design, on advanced continuous platform technology and development of digital tools has improved pharmaceutical development and manufacturing processes globally. By demonstrating the viability and benefits of advanced continuous manufacturing techniques, Strathclyde’s innovative approach to integrated development and operating platforms has enabled adoption within the pharmaceutical industry and created business opportunities for technology providers. As evidenced by the following examples, this has resulted in improved processes which have lowered development time and production costs, increased yields, reduced risk and enhanced product quality to the benefit of manufacturers, suppliers and end\-users. Upskilling of staff in new techniques and methods has also been achieved. Since August 2013, CMAC’s research has enabled approximately GBP45,000,000 of savings and improvements for the 22 multinational and SMEs who have invested directly in proprietary analytical and process improvement projects. 

 Contributing more broadly to technology translation for societal and economic benefit, CMAC’s work has generated 54 highly\-skilled individuals, 31 of whom have gone on to employment in industry \(e.g. AZ, Pfizer, GSK, Lilly, Novartis, Roche, Perceptive Engineering, National Physical Laboratory \(NPL\), Solid Form Solution, Process Systems Enterprise \(PSE\) Ltd, Mettler Toledo\) and 23 to academia \(e.g. Strathclyde, Imperial, Loughborough, Massachusetts Institute of Technology \(MIT\)\). 

###  Improved Industrial Process Development: 

-  CMAC research workflow outcomes \[ **R3**, **R5**\] were applied by AstraZeneca \(AZ; 2016\-18\) to improve a commercial process for a pharmaceutical product delivering GBP10,000,000 saving \[ **S1**\]. The improved process understanding led to reduced waste and increased product quality. 

-  In 2014, Novartis adopted CMAC Strathclyde’s novel methodology for introducing seed crystals into a continuous crystallisation \[ **R2**, **R3**\] in their continuous pilot plant in Basel, Switzerland. This approach has been applied to the development of an anti\-cancer product and at least 2 other active ingredients in development. As noted by the Novartis Development Engineer, ‘this effective application of CMAC research reduced chemical exposure risk to operators, minimised plant down time and improved product quality’ \[ **S2**\]. 

-  CMAC doctoral placements \(2013\-19\) installed a novel continuous nucleation and crystallisation platform at AZ which has since been used on 10 live medicinal compounds, 4 of which are in commercial manufacture \[ **R2**, **R3**, **R5**\]. This led to a 90% time reduction to generate the existing amount and quality of information compared to previous approaches. AZ’s Principal Scientist confirmed that, ‘Without the CMAC collaboration and student placements we would not have had the laboratory continuous crystallisation facilities established in this time frame or have been able to test the feasibility of continuous crystallisation on multiple AZ compounds. Using this new capability AZ scientists are be able to develop continuous crystallisation processes for APIs in\-house in a much shorter timescale’ \[ **S1**\]. 

-  The application of CMAC’s workflow approaches for particle attribute control at Eli Lilly in 2017 resulted in an improved particle size control from the use of high shear wet milling in the continuous crystallisation of the final active pharmaceutical ingredient for an oncology asset which was then in Phase IIb clinical trials \[ **R3**, **R6**\]. According to a Senior Engineering Advisor at Eli Lilly, by enabling the removal of a post processing dry milling step, this work ‘reduced fouling on the crystalliser walls \(reducing plant cleaning and down time\) and improved the physical product properties improving the product manufacturability. The removal of a milling step has reduced cycle times of each lot of product by 3 days and development time by 3 months. This is now a platform capability embedded at Lilly’ \[ **S3**\]. 

###  Enhanced workforce understanding and skills: 

-  The benefits of process insights from CMAC’s multivariate analysis \(MVA\) and data visualisation approaches were demonstrated on plant data at Lilly’s manufacturing plant in Ireland as part of a PhD project. These learnings enhanced process understanding and operations engagement with data analytics tools \[ **R1**, **R3**, **R6**\]. The project delivered real\-time data cleansing, organisation and visualisation enabling a reduction in plant downtime and product losses. The work demonstrated the benefits of MVA to senior management and resulted in investment in digitisation of manufacturing processes. As noted by the Eli Lilly Team Leader for Small Molecule Technical Services/Manufacturing Sciences, in Cork, Ireland, this ‘really raised awareness of the benefits to manufacturing when data and technology are combined with people with the right skillsets…this work was a significant factor in convincing the site to expand the use of these tools’ \[ **S4**\]. 

-  Working pre\-competitively with its 8 large pharma Tier 1 members, CMAC developed an industrially\-relevant workflow with 7 case studies providing methods to avoid the incorporation of impurities in crystals \[ **R4**, **R5**\]. Between Jan and Nov 2020, tailored training was provided to over 130 industry staff who subsequently applied the approaches directly into the process development of all their Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients \(APIs\) \[ **S5**\]. 

###  Advanced process technology and industry adoption: 

-  An Advanced Process Control \(APC\) system for continuous reaction and crystallisation was developed and demonstrated in collaboration with Perceptive Engineering, Centre for Process Innovation \(CPI\) and AstraZeneca \[ **R1**\]. The Managing Director of Perceptive Engineering said, ‘The commercialisation of this software directly led to one new client with follow\-on sales of GBP207,700, GBP400,000 of related projects, employment of 1 new FTE to support applications on continuous manufacturing and publication of 4 peer\-reviewed papers and 2 articles significantly increasing our visibility and reputation’ \[ **S6**\]. 

-  In collaboration with Alconbury Weston Ltd \(AWL\), CMAC developed and delivered a platform for continuous isolation \(filtration, washing and drying\) of APIs bridging from process development to manufacturing and reducing scale up risk \[ **R3**, **R6**\]. The platform is now in commercial production. As confirmed by AWL’s CEO, ‘Continuous isolation systems are rare at this scale and coupled with the demonstrated benefits of rapid processing times of less than 15 minutes, no particle shear or attrition, precise, repeatable dosing and consistent product, the unit has been demonstrated on >10 commercial molecules \(including vitamins, pharmaceuticals, Cannabidiol \(CBD\) and an energetic material\) with more than 15 companies. To date, 8 units have been sold with a further 3 on order, including 2 production scale systems for processing CBD and 2 systems are on hire around the world. The success of the new products based on the outstanding direction and input from Prof. Chris Price has allowed us to refine and commercialise a range of lab, pilot and production scale continuous filtration and drying systems for multiple industries’ \[ **S7**\]. 

###  Enhanced the global manufacturing landscape: 

-  At the request of Janet Woodcock, Head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, CMAC collaborated with the Novartis Centre for Continuous Manufacturing at MIT to initiate biennial symposia to advance continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing. Since 2014, the International Symposium for Continuous Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals \(ISCMP\) has been held 5 times \(2014, 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2021\), demonstrating sustained interest in its potential impact on the global medicines manufacturing landscape. Due to the Covid\-19 pandemic, the 2020/21 events were delivered as webinars which attracted over 500 delegates and facilitated discussion between key stakeholders: US and UK regulators \(FDA, MHRA\), industry bodies \(Medicines Manufacturing industry Partnership, MMIP\) and the UK Government \(Office for Life Sciences and Business Enterprise Innovation and Science, BEIS\). By bringing the wider international industry, regulatory and academic communities together to share case studies, develop and share practical guidance on continuous manufacturing \(further embedded through the publication of a series of whitepapers and reports\) CMAC has accelerated the pace of innovation and change in this strategically important industry sector. Attesting to this, the Chair of the Medicines Manufacturing Industry Partnership \(MMIP\) notes: ‘CMAC, on the basis of its research and recognised expertise, has strengthened international cooperation around continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing through the ISCMP. By facilitating discussion and focusing attention on key developments and issues to be addressed, this initiative has enhanced global relations and positioned the industry well to respond to current and future challenges’ \[ **S8**\]. 

###  Strengthened UK Research and Innovation: 

-  CMAC’s critical mass as a collaborative research centre has highlighted the success of the ‘triple helix’, coupling the power of industry, government and academia working together to accelerate change in the form of the adoption of continuous manufacturing. By working together with the Centre for Process Innovation \(CPI Ltd\), AZ and GSK, Strathclyde University helped to secure investment of GBP56,000,000 to create the Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre \(MMIC\) in 2018. This new facility, owned by CPI, will be built in 2021 and create 80 high value jobs by 2023 \[ **S9**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 By 2000, it became evident that, in Wales, interest in, knowledge of, and capacity for computing was not keeping pace with the transformational rise of the digital society and economy. Technocamps, the pan\-Wales school and community outreach unit established at Swansea University, has researched, championed and delivered **change in national curricula, qualifications, delivery and professional development** in order to foster a sustainable digital skills pipeline in Wales. 

-  Following our **2013 Independent Review of the ICT** **Curriculum** commissioned by the Welsh Government, we led in reforming the subject of ICT and **defining and implementing** a new statutory bilingual **Digital Competence Framework \(DCF\)** for all pupils in Wales aged 3 to 16. 

-  We led on **embedding the DCF in schools** by delivering 10 hours of workshops in each of 97% of the nation’s secondary schools. Since 2016 the DCF has been the primary mechanism of developing cross\-curricular digital skills for **all pupils** **in** **all Welsh schools**. 

-  We were instrumental in supporting a major 2018 sector review of ICT qualifications in Wales, and **creating innovative GCSE and A\-Level qualifications** in Digital Technology. 

-  We led the **development** of the new **Science & Technology Area of Learning and Experience** in the new Curriculum for Wales, which brings together biology, chemistry, computer science, design & technology, and physics for all learners aged 3 to 16. 

-  We have engaged deeply – our standard programme being 4 full days of activity – with over **45,000 young people** since August 2013 \(7% of the Welsh population today aged 5\-21, with a nearly\-even gender balance\) to create an interest in the subject, particularly amongst young girls to address a desperately under\-represented community in the digital workforce. 

-  We have trained over **100 teachers** across Wales who lack a formal ICT/Computing background yet need to teach these subjects due to the shortage of qualified teachers \(given that 75% of those teaching ICT/Computing in Wales have no ICT/Computing background\). 

-  We led the **Institute of Coding in Wales** project, part of a wider Office for Students investment in England, **impacting on businesses** throughout Wales with bespoke innovative CPD opportunities, in particular trailblazer Degree Apprenticeships, giving them competitive edge and saving money; one apprenticeship project will **save its company GBP400,000 per year.** 

 The impact of this is **evidenced** by **significant changes** in Welsh **schools**, **teachers \(and thus, teaching practice\)**, **pupils, businesses,** and in the **publication of the new** **Curriculum for Wales in January 2020**, to start from September 2022. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 1995, the Department of Computer Science established an industrial liaison unit, **ITWales**, to **facilitate impact of Swansea researchers on the Welsh economy** through intervention and engagement **.** ITWales was **highlighted in the EPSRC International Review** of ICT in 2006 and is **cited in the** **acknowledgements of research papers published by academics across the Welsh universities**. The Founding Director of ITWales, Beti Williams, won **Best Woman in Academia and Public Sector** category in the **Blackberry** **Woman of the Year** Awards 2006, and was appointed **MBE** in 2012 for pioneering work on small businesses. 

 Through two decades of research, cited and summarised in section 2.3 below and references \[ **R1\-R6**\], we identified a growing **need for direct school interventions** to address a crisis in computing and digital skills education. This **led to the creation of Technocamps** in 2003, supported by a sequence of grants, most recently \[ **G1\-G6**\]. Its mission is to provide a wide spectrum of activities aimed at identifying and addressing shortcomings in computing education and skills, covering all aspects of: awareness\-raising through engagement; curriculum and qualifications reform; policy and practice; and initial teacher education and professional development. More widely, its commitment to computer science education extends to widening participation, providing digital upskilling opportunities to people in employment as well as various opportunities for lifelong learning. 

 Microsoft was an early supporter of Technocamps, and subsequently created the *Computing at School* \(CAS\) initiative in England in 2008. CAS is largely run by and for teachers, contrasting Technocamps’ direct intervention by, and engagement with, University academics. Whilst the CAS approach is well suited to urban areas with critical masses of schools and capable teachers \[ **R1**\], **our research indicates that direct intervention is critical** elsewhere – and in particular throughout Wales. Analyses of the impact of each approach reported in \[ **R2, R3**\] – co\-authored by the Director of Technocamps and the Chair of CAS Wales – **evidence** the **inadequacies of the CAS approach in Wales in contrast to the impact of Technocamps**’ direct intervention methodology. 

 We have explored different models for introducing and embedding competence and confidence in the nation’s computing teachers, as well as means to increase the pipeline into the profession amongst computing graduates, reporting these models in various **research publications**: which succeeded and which failed, analysing why, and evidencing impact. In particular, in \[ **R4**\] we describe the impact of our direct teacher intervention programme and **evidence the need for its methodology**; and in \[ **R5**\] we reflect on a school placement scheme we introduced which has impacted positively on the participating schools as well as generated a stream of graduates into teacher training. Our efforts in improving education in schools has in return impacted positively on our undergraduate teaching as described in \[ **R6**\].

 From researching the relevant issues since 2000, and by establishing Technocamps in 2003 as a formal unit in which to do so, our influence and impact has been steadily growing – within government, and on schools, school children and teachers across the nation – in: advocating for a need for curriculum reform; stimulating a demand for these; producing the defining reports on these; introducing these within the nation’s schools; and providing much\-needed professional development for teachers to deliver them, in Welsh and English. Our main impact since August 2013 has been in three areas: 

1.  The creation and embedding of a new national **Digital Competence Framework**. 

1.  **Curriculum reform** leading to the transformation of ICT education, and the development of a new Science & Technology Area of Learning and Experience. 

1.  The creation of **new GCSE and A\-level** **qualifications in** **Digital Technology**. 

 **4.1 The Digital Competence Framework** 

 In his Keynote Speech at the 2012 Technocamps Annual Conference, the Minister for Education and Skills for Wales created an environment for impact for Technocamps by declaring that: 

 *“Technocamps is an important driver in making sure learners in Wales are best placed to take advantage of opportunities \[in the expanding digital workforce\]. I would encourage headteachers to ensure that their school is engaged with Technocamps.”* \[ **C1**\] 

 He also announced the creation of the digital learning platform, *Hwb*, supported by a *National Digital Literacy Council*, with Moller and Crick as expert advisors; and subsequently commissioned a subject review co\-chaired by Crick with Moller as a panel member. The September 2013 ICT Review Report published by this panel proposed the introduction of a **Digital Competence Framework** \(DCF\) to sit alongside the existing *Numeracy and Literacy Frameworks*. This proposal was picked up and included as a recommendation in “ *Successful Futures: Independent Review of Curriculum and Assessment Arrangements in Wales*” \(March 2015\). According to the author of this work: 

 *“The ICT review was influential in my curriculum review in two ways: I adopted its recommendation for increasing the prominence of cross\-curricular digital skills, resulting in the DCF; and it fed into my thinking in embedding computer science into the Science and Technology AoLE.”* \[ **C2**\] 

 This recommendation was immediately adopted by Welsh Government, and Crick led digital pioneer teachers in developing its content. According to the Welsh Government Minister of Education, 

 *“The Digital Competence Framework owes much to Professor Crick’s leadership. He took a leading role in defining the DCF, chairing its development to publication for all schools in Wales in September 2016.”* \[ **C3**\] 

 The DCF was introduced in a phased fashion into schools starting in September 2018, to be fully integrated in all schools at all levels from September 2021, with an effort led by Technocamps. In 2018, Technocamps was commissioned by the Minister of Education to facilitate the introduction of the DCF in schools with a project to deliver 3\-hour workshops in secondary schools. This was in recognition of the impact of Technocamps’ direct intervention model \(see \[ **R4\-R5**\] above\). By the end of the 18\-month project, due to numerous requests for return visits, we averaged over 10 hours of workshops in each of more than 97% of the nation’s secondary schools. The impact of this intervention is evidenced by letters from schools, the following quote from a school head being indicative: 

 *“Technocamps played an essential role in the introduction and implementation of the DCF within our school. The support provided was invaluable and provided a springboard to ensure an effective take\-up throughout the school.”* \[ **C4**\] 

 **4.2 The Future of Science & Technology Education in Wales** 

 As part of the wider Curriculum for Wales reforms as outlined in “Successful Futures” \(2015\), Crick was invited to **lead the future vision of Science &Technology education**, by chairing one of the six new *Areas of Learning and Experience* \(AoLE\). The Science & Technology AoLE brings together the disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer science, design & technology, and physics for all learners in Wales aged 3 to 16. This was a radical innovation from the current national curriculum in Wales, providing the opportunity for interdisciplinary cross\-curricular learning, as well as the first time that computer science was recognised as a core subject. As part of these reforms, Crick was also appointed in 2017 to **chair the National Network for Excellence in Science & Technology \(NNEST\),** with Moller as a board member, a £4M strategic investment by the Welsh Government to support the professional development of teachers in this key area of the new *Curriculum for Wales*. The NNEST has demonstrably improved confidence and capability for STEM practitioners in Wales, with major research\-led policy and practice initiatives across primary and secondary\-level settings, in partnership with all HE institutions in Wales. It has also directly contributed to the development of a new national strategy for educational research and enquiry in Wales. According to the Welsh Government Minister of Education: 

 *“Professor Crick has played a leading role working on the Science and Technology AoLE, as well as being inaugural chair of the National Network of Excellence in Science and Technology \(NNEST\), both of which included Professor Moller as an expert advisor. I have been clear on the importance of higher education's wider civic mission agenda and specifically the body of knowledge and activities which Technocamps represents as a pan\-Wales organisation involving all of the nation’s higher education institutions.”* \[ **C3**\] 

 **4.3 New Qualifications in Digital Technology** 

 In 2012, the Minister of Education in England declared that ICT education was not fit for purpose and that ICT qualifications \(GCSE and A\-level\) would be removed, leaving computer science as the only digital qualification. In response, *Qualifications Wales* \(QW\) – the body created in 2015 to regulate all qualifications in Wales below HE level – established a working group to consider the future of ICT in Wales. As members of this group, we were vocal in recognising ICT as a worthy qualification distinct from computer science. However, we also saw scope for wholly new qualifications which would address the *use* of digital technology, and we proposed that QW develop thinking towards the creation of **new** **GCSE and A\-level qualifications in Digital Technology**. 

 We worked with QW in developing these ideas and hosted the launch of their **Review of ICT Provision Report, **“Delivering Digital” \(December 2018\), which announced the introduction of these new qualifications. We have subsequently been sitting on their Advisory Group developing the frameworks for these qualifications; and we are working on the **development of the GCSE curriculum, and on teaching and learning resources** to provide the professional development that will be much needed by the teachers that will be delivering this from September 2021. Our impact in driving this change is acknowledged by the Director of QW: 

 *“Qualifications Wales is grateful for the advice and support that Technocamps has provided. We are benefitting from this, in defining the new curriculum and in making it a reality. Due to their national recognition and reach, we very much view Technocamps as a one\-stop shop for expertise, knowledge, and implementation of computing and digital education for Wales.”* \[ **C5**\] 

 **4.4 Wider Impact** 

 Besides the profound impact on education that we have had through the DCF and curriculum reform, Technocamps has had further impact across a wide spectrum of stakeholders and beneficiaries \(see \[ **C9**\] for general testimonials\). 

-  **We impact teachers** by providing professional development opportunities \(see research references \[ **R4,R5**\] above\) to enable them to deliver the new computing curriculum and qualifications – particularly necessary given that only 25% of the nation’s Computing/ICT teachers have a relevant background. Since 2015, we have been providing a programme of study requiring teachers to spend one day per fortnight on Swansea University campus throughout the year. In the first year, **13 teachers** completed the programme; and in the second year, a further **17 teachers** did so. The popularity of the programme has grown due to its impact on participating schools, to the point where in 2018, **43 teachers** graduated from the course. This programme is directly impacting on substantial numbers of young people, as evidenced in various case studies. For example, one Assistant Headteacher in a remote school, having undertaken our teacher training programme, introduced GCSE Computing in her school for a healthy\-sized cohort, resulting in 84% scoring A\* to C \(with 26% scoring A\*\) against a national average of 49% A\*\- C. In her support letter, she writes: 

 *“This excellent result would not have been possible without Technocamps support.”* \[ **C6**\] 

-  **We impact young people** by enlightening them on the wider benefits of studying computer science and related STEM subjects at GCSE and A\-level and beyond. Since August 2013, we have engaged with 45,000 young people – 7% of the Welsh population today aged 5\-24 – with a nearly even gender balance **.** There has been a dramatic year\-on\-year increase in the number of first\-year computer science students at Swansea: from 150 starting in October 2015, to 250 starting in October 2016, to 350 starting in October 2017 \(despite the entry requirements being made slightly more stringent\). Whilst there are various factors for this, Technocamps has had a demonstrable influence on this trend: potential students and their parents regularly acknowledge Technocamps during University Visit Days as a brand they recognise and of which they have had a positive experience. Furthermore, the work of Technocamps ensures that this growing pipeline is not only greater but populated by students who have a deeper understanding and appreciation of the subject. \( **Data available in** \[ **C8**\] **.\)** 

-  **We impact businesses** through the **Institute of Coding \(IoC\) in Wales**. In 2018, the Prime Minister Theresa May announced the establishment of the National *Institute of Coding \(IoC\)*, a three\-year, GBP20,000,000 academic think tank representing a collaboration of 20 universities aimed at widening participation and expanding the pipeline of students into computer science education. As a HEFCE\-funded initiative, only universities in England benefit \(financially\) from this initiative. However, due to the recognition of the work of Technocamps in Wales, Swansea University was included in the tender to HEFCE. Once it was launched, HEFCW provided support for the *IoC in Wales* under Professor Moller’s Directorship through a GBP1,200,000 grant to Swansea University. This has facilitated our successful **Degree Apprenticeship** programme, and in 2019 we produced the first cohort of Degree Apprenticeship Graduates in Wales, with many strong case studies being provided. According to the Director of EPS Construction, the final\-year software project that their apprentice carried out reaped unexpectedly great benefits: 

 *“This software will save EPS £400,000 per year, already saving £70,000 on one of our completed trial job.”* \[ **C7**\] 

-  **We impact Swansea University**, through \(i\) driving the establishment of *CoSMOS: the College of Science Margam Outreach Space* in 2019, a unique facility embodying and underpinning the University’s civic mission agenda; \(ii\) providing positive reform to the pedagogic underpinning of the undergraduate programme as described above \(research reference **\[R6\]** above\); and \(iii\) through the establishment in 2018 of a cross\-disciplinary research group *EHP: Educational, Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Computer Science* as the research arm of Technocamps. 

-  **We impact the UK University Leadership**, through the establishment of an *Outreach Committee* of *CPHC: the Council of Professors and Heads of Computing*. Technocamps Swansea was to host the first meeting held by this committee in April 2020, though the Covid\-19 pandemic forced its cancellation. An aim of this Committee, with membership from all four nations of the UK, is to determine how to transfer the successful university\-based model of Technocamps in Wales \(research reference \[ **R3**\] above\) to the three other nations.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The impact of McHugh’s work is embodied in the wide and deep legal uptake of the paradigm\-shift concept of aboriginal title that he pioneered and to which he continues to contribute. This concept was of critical importance in reversing the conception that aboriginal territories occupied by the British Crown were *terrae nullius* \(nobody’s land\) rather than territories subject to the public authority of indigenous polities. McHugh’s work on aboriginal title has fundamentally changed the dynamics of engagement between aboriginal people and the State, politically and legally. The most visible manifestations of this impact since August 2013 include settlements and landmark legal decisions resolving contemporary claims to traditional resource rights and of historical claims in Canada and New Zealand worth hundreds of millions of pounds as well as profound significance for the culture and economic basis of thousands of indigenous peoples and their communities. Three examples are the *Alderville* case’s GBP640M settlement in 2018, benefitting thousands of people from seven First Nations in Canada; the reinterpretation of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, between the British Crown and the Maori in New Zealand, in a 2014 landmark decision of the Waitangi Tribunal \(which refers to McHugh no less than 99 times\); and the recognition of Maori customary title over the foreshore and seabed in the 2016 case *Re Tipene* \(applying statutory tests derived from McHugh\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 McHugh’s work has had a decisive influence on the legal framing and recognition of aboriginal claims. Up to the 1980s, national courts in many common law countries had applied variants of the *terra nullius* fiction to forestall any legal accountability of the Crown in its handling of relations with indigenous peoples. The *terra nullius* legal supposition that the aboriginal territories occupied by the British Crown lacked any pre\-existing governmental authority or land ownership, meant that national political systems made little effort to accommodate traditional aboriginal resource rights into allocation and decision\-making processes whilst historical land claims were dismissed as unimportant bygones. The concept of the aboriginal title introduced by McHugh’s work became a platform against the *terra nullius* politics of inaction and severe marginalisation, and was effectively mobilised in litigation, most notably in Canada and New Zealand, but also in other countries, to begin a process of legal recognition of aboriginal status and redress which is still ongoing. 

 Two book\-length monographs give the fullest statement of this research: McHugh’s *Aboriginal Societies and the Common Law* **\[R1\]** provides a historic overview of the interactions between the common law legal system and the aboriginal peoples of North America and Australasia. The book starts by assessing the general nature of British imperialism and its position towards non\-Christian people in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries. In the second section, the book focuses on the post\-imperial states of North America and Australasia from their early national periods to the modern era. The relationship between the common law and the rights of aboriginal peoples is described in terms of the enduring but constantly shifting questions of sovereignty, status and the nature of legal thought. In a final section, these insights are applied to the political resurgence of aboriginal peoples since the 1970s and their growing calls for self\-determination. 

 McHugh’s *Aboriginal Title: The Modern Jurisprudence of Tribal Land Rights* **\[R2\]** continues the exploration of this relationship, by focussing specifically on the proprietary notion of aboriginal title. The development of the aboriginal title is one of the most innovative and controversial doctrines in the modern history of the common law. The doctrine was adopted by the common law courts in Canada, followed by New Zealand and then Australia in the famous *Mabo No 2* case. These high\-profile court cases recognised the common\-law basis of aboriginal title as an enforceable proprietary interest, a transformation with huge political and economic consequence.  In the allocation and regulation of resources \(such as land and fisheries\), Governments could no longer marginalise aboriginal claims to current and past ownership rights.  Aboriginal title spread to other common law jurisdictions facing similar issues, such as Malaysia, Belize, and countries of southern Africa. This book provides a critical assessment of the doctrine, its early conceptualisation then elaboration in the common law courts. 

 The ideas described in these two books have been extended in a series of peer\-reviewed journal articles and contributions to edited volumes. This work further develops the history of imperial practices and their importance for contextualising the emergence and evolution of the legal concept of the aboriginal title both within specific country contexts and across jurisdictions. Examples of these extensions include articles covering Canada **\[R3\]**, New Zealand **\[R4\]**, the role of legal historians in framing the past **\[R5\]**, and the pre\-Revolutionary American colonies **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of McHugh’s work is embodied in the wide and deep legal uptake, in legal proceedings, statutes and legal education, of the paradigm\-shift concept of aboriginal title that he pioneered in his research. This concept is now an orthodoxy in national legal systems routinely incorporated into government decision\-making. The legal acceptance of the aboriginal title as a proprietary interest has fundamentally changed tribal peoples’ terms of engagement with governments. It has had a lasting impact on the legal and political leverage of aboriginal peoples and the recognition of their rights in common law jurisdictions around the world, particularly in Canada and New Zealand, as detailed below, but also in other common law countries and beyond. 

 The most visible impact of McHugh’s work since August 2013 can be discussed around several watershed court cases and claims proceedings where his research was at the core of the paradigm\-shifting argument. These have spawned settlements of contemporary claims to traditional resource rights and of historical claims worth hundreds of millions of pounds and of profound significance for thousands of people from indigenous groups. 

 **Canada** 

 In Canada, McHugh has appeared as an expert historical witness in a large number of court cases. Some are particularly noteworthy. 

 First, the *Alderville First Nation* hearing had stretched into its fifth year of trial proceedings before settlement, with McHugh providing two expert witness reports **\[E1\]**. First Nations challenged the legality of the last old\-style land cession treaties \(1923\) between the Crown and indigenous peoples in Canada covering wide areas of southern Ontario. Referring specifically to the CAD 1.11 billion \(over GBP640M\) settlement reached in August 2018 in the *Alderville* case, Carole Lindsay, General Counsel in the Aboriginal Law Division in the Ontario Regional Office of Canada’s Department of Justice, emphasises the specific impact of McHugh’s work in the outcome: ‘\[i\] *n historical cases such as these* \[footnote 1 refers to the *Alderville* case\] *, the credibility of the expert witnesses is central to the litigation and often dispositive of the issue before the court. The AGC* \[Attorney General of Canada\] *has adopted the results of Professor McHugh’s research because the AGC considers him to be the most credible expert in his field*’ **\[E2\]**. 

 The settlement of the case, which affects seven First Nations amounting to approximately 3800 people, was unanimously welcomed by their leaders. Some quotes from the chiefs of these First Nations are telling of the profound significance of the settlement both symbolically, culturally and economically: ‘ *I am extremely proud that the negotiations team has successfully resolved our longstanding battle for constitutionally protected hunting and fishing rights. Our ancestors have fought since 1923 to exercise our rights freely and without encumbrance and finally we have been able to secure this for our people and for future generations*’ \(Chief Kelly LaRocca, Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation\); ‘ *On this historic day, we acknowledge the hard work of our ancestors, our elders, our leaders and knowledge keepers in their determination to have our collective Treaty rights recognized and affirmed*’ \(Chief Phyllis Williams, Curve Lake First Nation\); ‘ *It is with honour and pride to our ancestors and our people today that we have settled the Williams Treaties claim for our Seven Generations to come*’ \(Chief Laurie Carr, Hiawatha First Nation\); ‘ *Rama First Nation joins with Williams Treaties leadership in celebrating the conclusion of the work our ancestors began so long ago, the resolution of this long\-standing claim. The restoration of harvesting rights throughout our territories is a part of our cultural identity that these treaties compromised*’ \(Chief Rodney Noganosh, Rama First Nation\) **\[E3\]**. 

 Second, McHugh appeared recently in the ongoing *Chippewas of Saugeen et al v. The Attorney General of Canada* and the *Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation, et al. v. The Attorney General of Canada, et al.* cases \(known as the ‘Treaty 72’ or *Bruce Peninsula* claim proceedings\). These cases concern an indigenous claim to Crown breach of treaty involving valuable and scenic land on an isthmus between Lake Huron and Georgian Bay as well as the claim to a subsisting aboriginal title over the lakebed itself **\[E4\]**. Like the *Alderville* case \(before its settlement\), this is one the highest\-stakes cases on aboriginal title in the Canadian legal system. Carole Lindsay’s testimonial specifically refers to the AGC’s reliance on McHugh’s expert report in these cases **\[E4\]** \(footnote 1\), again ‘ *because the AGC considers him to be the most credible expert in his field*’. The complexity of the case is exemplified by the fact that, during the tribunal hearing of December 2019, Professor McHugh was examined in Court for three full days **\[E5\]** \(examination starts at page 8755\). 

 McHugh’s role in these proceedings is evidence, more generally, of the influence and stature of his work in the understanding of the role of the law in British imperial history and the Crown’s relations with indigenous polities, including specifically the legal effect of the Royal Proclamation 1763 and its bearing upon official land dealings in the pre\- and early\-Confederation eras. McHugh’s historical work retrieves the legal frame within which key past actors, Crown officials, especially, functioned. Senior General Counsel in Canada’s Department of Justice between 2001 and 2019, with overall responsibility for the management of aboriginal litigation involving the federal Crown, describes the impact of McHugh’s scholarship as an ‘ *exceptional result*’ which played a ‘ *crucial role … in the gradual unfolding of the Canadian constitutional framework in relation to the relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples*’ **\[E6\]**. 

 McHugh has been commissioned by the Attorney\-General of Canada as an expert legal historian on several other equally high\-profile occasions **\[E2\]**. Examples of these other research impacts include the role of the law in numerous land cessions and transactions in the Great Lakes region of pre\-Confederation Canada, the Crown’s Indian land policy in colonial Vancouver Island and British Columbia, the admission of Rupert’s Land to the Canadian Confederation, and to the two Williams Treaties in southern Ontario \(1923\). This work characteristically historicises the notion of public authority as it would have been understood within official circles at the time, paying particular attention to the interaction of office and prerogative in contextualised settings. 

 **New Zealand** 

 In New Zealand, McHugh’s research has been widely relied on a matter as fundamental as the interpretation of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi \( *Te Tiriti o Waitangi*\) whereby Britain and the Māori organised public authority over New Zealand. In 1975, New Zealand established by statute the Waitangi Tribunal to handle a wide range of territorial and natural resources claims by Māori groups against the Crown under the Treaty of Waitangi. Since its creation the Tribunal has registered over 2500 claims, partly or fully reported on over 1000 claims, and issued over 120 reports covering 80% of New Zealand’s landmass. One report **\[E7\]**, issued on 14 October 2014, set the direction the Tribunal would take in subsequent reports \(see e.g. **\[E8\]\)** on the process, meaning and effect of the Waitangi Treaty. The Tribunal solicited reports from scholars distinguished for their work in national and indigenous history. The report drew widely upon McHugh \(99 references\) in the substantive text \(see e.g. pp. 44\-46, 327\-331, 412\-413, 460\-462, 474\-475\), the conclusions \(at p. 525\), and in endnotes \(see e.g. Chapter 2, endnotes 154, 218, 223, 229, 235, 237, 239, 248, 250, 252, 256, abundantly referring to R1\). 

 McHugh’s research has also been central to the advancement and settlement of proprietorial claims \(commercial sea fisheries\) by Ngai Tahu, the South Island’s primary Maori *iwi* \(tribe\) **\[E9\]**. Aboriginal title is fundamental to the present dispute over freshwater rights as well as in determining Maori rights in the marine regions of the South Island. By way of context, the indigenous fisheries sector in New Zealand appeared in the early 1990s as a result of the increasing acceptance of Maori sea\-fishing rights, which today employs over 3000 people in regional ports around the country. This industry is now a global flagbearer for indigenous resource development, emblematic of cultural as well as economic and social revitalization. 

 In 2014, McHugh, together with C. Bell, provided an expert report for the New Zealand Government \(expressly based on McHugh’s research\) on the role of the aboriginal title tests as incorporated into the Marine and Coastal Area \( *Takutai* *Moana*\) Act 2011 **\[E10\]** and, before that, the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004. The first\-ever recognition of a Maori customary title over the foreshore and seabed in the case *Re Tipene* \(2016\) **\[E11\]** was an outcome impossible without McHugh’s work. **\[Text removed for publication\].** It can be seen in the 2004 and 2011 statutory mechanisms for recognition of Maori coastal rights \(such as the section 58 requirements for a customary marine title \(CMR\)\), outcomes like *Re Tipene* case \(2016\) where the CMR test was satisfied \(at paras. 149 and 179\), and Ngai Tahu’s commencement of legal proceedings for recognition of their aboriginal freshwater rights. 

 **Wider influence** 

 While McHugh’s own research and legal involvement primarily focuses on Canada and New Zealand, his work has been picked up in other jurisdictions, such as South Africa and Malaysia **\[E13; E14\]**. It has also received attention in Israel \(as regards the Bedouin\) **\[E15\]**. So far, this influence is intellectual, but it is noted because such was also the case in the early stages of the recognition of the concept of aboriginal title in Canada and New Zealand in the 1980s, which over time led to a paradigm\-shift.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 International climate treaties use metrics to place emissions of greenhouse gases \(GHGs\) other than carbon dioxide \(CO<sub>2</sub>\) on a common CO<sub>2</sub>\-equivalent \(CO<sub>2</sub>e\) scale. Research at Reading has made a major contribution to the computation of a necessary input to such metrics: the ‘Radiative Efficiency’ \(RE\) of individual gases. This work expanded the number of gases for which RE values are available, helped resolve discrepancies reported in the literature, and developed consistent methodologies for their computation. Reading’s research is used extensively by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) to compute metrics required in treaties including the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\).  Reading’s research also contributed to the debate on the design of metrics; it created a new metric called the Global Temperature\-Change Potential \(GTP\) and helped develop a variant \(GWP\*\) of the widely\-used Global Warming Potential \(GWP\) metric. These have gained traction in how individual countries and sectors approach climate change mitigation.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Human activity causes emissions of many GHGs that differ from CO<sub>2</sub> in their effect on climate. International and national climate policy employs ‘exchange rates’ to place emissions of such gases on a common ‘CO<sub>2</sub>e’ scale. These exchange rates are calculated using ‘climate emission metrics’ \(hereafter ‘metrics’\) which enable the climate effect of the emission of a given gas to be compared with the effect of emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>. 

 Reading has contributed significantly to calculations of RE values for many GHGs; these are a necessary input for calculating metrics such as the GWP. This work included the first published calculations of RE for many gases. One example is nitrogen trifluoride \(NF<sub>3</sub>\), which is widely used in the electronics industry, and for which, prior to 2006, an RE value had never been published. Shine asked Ford Motor Company colleagues to perform new spectroscopic measurements; Reading’s calculation of its RE was 60% higher than what could be \(indirectly\) inferred from earlier work \[R1\]. Research at Reading also helped resolve significant differences in RE values in earlier literature. For example, RE values for some of the most abundant hydrofluorocarbons \(HFCs\) differed by more than 20%. Reading \[R2\] led a detailed intercomparison with the University of Oslo, which increased confidence in these RE values.  Results from \[R1\] and \[R2\] were used by the IPCC to produce its GWP tabulations in their Working Group 1 Fourth Assessment Report \(AR4, approved in June 2007\). IPCC tabulations are the definitive source of GWP values used in policy applications. 

 Shine then played a major role, as part of an international collaboration, in a detailed critical assessment of available REs and the underlying spectroscopic data \[R3\]. Prior to this, AR4 had used REs for 60 halocarbons, and related gases, which had been drawn from different sources, employing diverse methodologies. Reference \[R3\] developed a common methodology to estimate RE, enabling improved internal consistency, and then applied it to over 200 gases. IPCC’s fifth Assessment Report \(AR5, approved in September 2013 and formally published in January 2014\) adopted this greatly expanded dataset in its metric tabulations \[R4\]. Collins was AR5’s author with prime responsibility for generating these tabulations, having moved to Reading during the writing of this assessment. 

 Since the early 1990s, there has been an ongoing debate within academic and policymaking circles about whether alternatives to the GWP might serve climate policy better. However, no new metrics had gained significant traction. In 2005, Shine led the development of the GTP metric \[R5\]. The GWP is the time\-integrated radiative forcing following a pulse emission of a gas, relative to the same quantity due to an equal emission of CO<sub>2</sub>; it is currently the most widely\-used metric, normally employing a 100\-year integration period \(GWP\(100\)\). By contrast, the GTP provides the temperature change at a given time after an emission of a GHG, again, compared to an equal emission of CO<sub>2</sub>. Hence, unlike the GWP, the GTP specifically addresses the temperature impact of emissions \[R5\] and so may be more appropriate to temperature targets specified in the UNFCCC Paris Agreement. As a demonstration of the effect of using GTP on the perceived importance of emissions, the GWP\(100\) of methane is 24, whereas the GTP\(100\) is four \[R4\]. Tabulated values of GTP were included, for the first time, in AR5. Collins calculated these values for AR5 \[R4\] using an updated methodology compared to \[R5\] for over 200 gases; this made GTP values readily available to the policy community. 

 Shine collaborated with colleagues at the University of Oxford and other institutions in developing an alternative metric, known as GWP\* \[R6\], which built heavily on his GTP work \[R5\].  The GWP\* is based on a distinct application of existing GWP values; it exploits the fact that the impact of emissions on temperature is better captured by comparing pulse emissions of long\-lived species \(e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>\) to sustained emissions of short\-lived species \(e.g. methane\). Notably, the work identified possible flaws in the standard application of the GWP in future scenarios with decreasing emissions of short\-lived species. The GWP\* employed existing GWP values, for example from \[R4\], to provide continuity with the conventional use of GWP, but adopted several approximations to do so. Collins, with Shine, then developed a new pulse\-sustained metric which avoided these approximations, and so placed the concept on a physically more robust footing \[R7\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Policy Implementation:** Reading’s RE calculations made significant contributions to tabulations of metrics presented by IPCC in AR4 \[S1\] and AR5 \[S2\]. These have subsequently been used to implement climate policy worldwide. Several examples follow, first considering UNFCCC and then other policy applications. 

  

 First, the 2012 Doha Amendment to the UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol, which covers emissions in the period between 2013 and 2020, added NF<sub>3</sub> \[R1\] to its list of GHG emissions to be included in national commitments, using its AR4 GWP\(100\) value. This Amendment was accepted by 146 of the current 147 signatory countries during the REF2021 Impact Period. In November 2013, the UNFCCC adopted AR4 GWP\(100\) values in its requirement for countries to report their annual CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions. Then in November 2018, under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, which supersedes the Kyoto Protocol, it formally adopted AR5 GWP\(100\) values \[R4\] for this reporting. Similarly, in May 2020, the European Union \(EU\) adopted AR5 GWP values in its regulations for member states to report their greenhouse gas emissions from 1 January 2021 onwards \[S3\]. 

 A specific policy focus has been HFC emissions, because of their growing usage in air\-conditioning units in buildings and vehicles, and other sectors, including refrigeration. UNFCCC data shows that CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions from developed nations \(Annex 1\) rose by a factor of three between 1990 and 2017, whereas total CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions remained almost constant. Thus, HFC emissions constituted a growing percentage of the total \(for example now 3% in UK, 3.5% in Japan\). To curb future growth, there have been widespread efforts to move to low\-GWP HFC alternatives. The legislation, some of which is detailed in the next paragraph, is reliant on reliable GWP \(and hence RE\) values for its implementation. 

 In 2014, the EU Fluorocarbon Gas Regulation adopted AR4 GWP values. This regulation mandated that HFC usage in different sectors should be phased out between 2015 and 2025. As an important example, the EU identified one gas, HFC\-32, as being a technologically feasible low\-GWP alternative. Its RE, in AR4, originates from Reading\-led research that resolved earlier disagreements \[R2, S1\]. This regulation led to a major shift in HFC usage, for example, in air conditioning units manufactured by Mitsubishi UK. In 2018, the European Environment Agency reported a subsequent 54% \(CO<sub>2</sub>e\) reduction in HFC usage in the EU, relative to 2011\-2013, which is an indicator of the regulation’s success. Japan \(in 2016\) and Canada \(in 2019\) implemented similar legislation that required HFC GWP values. The 2016 Kigali Amendment to the UN’s Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer \[S4\] set binding targets for reducing HFC emissions in developed and developing nations based on AR4 GWP\(100\) values. This Amendment entered into force \(i.e. became legally binding\) in January 2019 and is currently ratified by 112 countries \[S4\]. 

 **Contribution to Policy Debate:** Reading’s work on alternative metrics \(GTP and GWP\*\) to the GWP has impacted public policy by enabling a debate on the most appropriate metrics for use in meeting specific climate policy objectives. Prior to AR5, no proposed alternatives had gained traction with policymakers, and the GWP had been the only metric recommended by IPCC. Thus, GWP, and specifically GWP\(100\), became UNFCCC’s established standard metric. In 2013, tabulated values of GTP were included, for the first time, in IPCC’s AR5 \[R5, S5\]; unlike earlier IPCC assessments, AR5 refrained from specifically recommending any particular metric, GWP\(100\) or otherwise. 

 The GTP is used in numerous national and international contexts. As examples, the Norwegian Environment Agency adopted it in its 2016 action plan to reduce emissions of short\-lived climate pollutants; and in 2016, the UN Environment Program\-hosted Life Cycle Initiative \(which includes many governmental and industrial funding partners\) recommended the GTP\(100\) as one of three climate indicators in Life Cycle Impact Assessment \[S6\]. 

 The GTP is also discussed in some Nationally Determined Contributions \(NDCs\) which embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement. Brazil’s 2016 NDC states that the GTP is “most consistent with contributions to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2°C above pre\-industrial levels” \(i.e. the specific aim of the Paris Agreement\). Uruguay’s 2016 NDC highlights the AR5 comment that “the GWP metric is not directly related to a temperature limit, as the 2°C target ..., whereas other metrics like the GTP may be more suitable …” \[S7\]. 

 In 2018, a UN climate agreement included specific mention of the GTP for the first time. The UNFCCC’s 2018 decision to adopt the AR5 GWP\(100\) values \(see above and \[S3\]\) was accompanied by the statement that “each Party may …  also use other metrics \(e.g. global temperature potential\) to report supplemental information on aggregate emissions …”.  This reflects an ongoing, unresolved debate within the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice \(SBSTA\), which noted:  “limitations in the use of GWPs based on the 100\-year time horizon in evaluating … emissions of \[gases\] with short lifetimes” \[S8\]. 

 In the short time since the GWP\* was proposed, it has already impacted on the policy debate, particularly for countries and sectors that are major methane emitters because of the scale of their agricultural activity. Shine played a significant role in disseminating the concept to stakeholders, including a side\-event at the UNFCCC COP23 \(Bonn, 2017\), and invited talks at the Climate and Clean Air Coalition’s Scientific Advisory Panel Expert Workshop \(Ottawa, 2017\) and IPCC’s Expert Meeting on Short\-lived Climate Forcers \(Geneva, 2018\). 

 The most notable policy impact of GWP\* was its role in motivating a new treatment of agricultural methane emissions by New Zealand in their national climate legislation. New Zealand’s 2019 Climate Change Response \(Zero Carbon\) Amendment Act sets separate targets for emissions of \(1\) long\-lived greenhouse gases, aiming for net zero by 2050, and \(2\) biogenic methane emissions, aiming for a reduction of 24 to 47% below 2017 levels by 2050. Targets were set on the advice of New Zealand’s Productivity Commission which had concluded that the GWP\* can “help people make better decisions about mitigation.” This decision is now reflected in New Zealand’s 2020 NDC \[S9\]. 

 The GWP\* was considered in detail by the UK Committee on Climate Change in their 2020 report ‘Land use: Policies for a Net Zero UK.’ A joint statement by agricultural organisations in the UK and New Zealand, including the National Farmers’ Union, supported the adoption of the GWP\*. Furthermore, the International Dairy Sustainability Framework \(IDSF\) launched a project to examine “the potential benefits and disadvantages for the global ruminant sector of applying GWP\*,” with the IDSF acting on behalf of organisations including Arla Foods, International Dairy Federation, McDonalds, and Meat and Livestock Australia \[S10\]. 

 In summary, Reading’s research has contributed directly to climate policy, by providing results that are required to implement methods for placing emissions of non\-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases on a CO<sub>2</sub>e scale. These methods are needed to enact both international climate policy and policies developed by individual nations and groups of nations. Reading’s work has regularly updated those results, in the light of improved understanding, and it has helped enable the calculation of values for an increasing number of such gases. Its contribution to definitive tabulations in international climate assessments has enabled their wide uptake by stakeholder communities throughout the world and hence influenced mitigation actions, most notably in the area of fluorocarbon emissions. Its work on methodologies for placing emissions on CO<sub>2</sub>e scales has contributed to an ongoing debate within the UNFCCC, and beyond, on the most appropriate methodologies. This has influenced the framing of mitigation actions by individual nations and stakeholder communities. Thus, Reading’s research has had both a global reach and a significant influence on an important component of international and national environmental policymaking.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Vassilis Monastiriotis' research on the adjustment of the Greek labour market to the Eurozone crisis led to his appointment to an Independent Experts Committee, convened by government to make a recommendation on minimum wage reform. Monastiriotis' published research and policy input on the impact of minimum wages in Greece played a key role in the recommendation by the Committee and directly informed the government’s decision \- against international policy advice at the time \- to raise the minimum wage by 10.9% in February 2019, benefitting an estimated 600,000 individuals \(approximately 30% of private sector employees\) and another 250,000 individuals whose out\-of\-work benefits are indexed on the minimum wage. As predicted by Dr Monastiriotis’ research, while improving individual outcomes for the low\-paid and reducing the risk of poverty, the reform had no adverse effects on the economy, as unemployment continued to fall uninterrupted and economy\-wide wage\-costs increased only marginally. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As the economic crisis in Greece unfolded between 2009 and 2016, Monastiriotis undertook an extensive programme of research on the adjustment of the Greek labour market to the crisis and to the subsequent policy reforms. Two of his papers \- **\[1\]** and **\[2\]**, in collaboration with Dr Rebekka Christopoulou, University of Macedonia, Greece \- were instrumental in showing how public and private sector wages adjusted during the crisis, indicating in particular a significant compression of wages at the bottom of the distribution. A third paper \- **\[3\]**, with Dr Angelo Martelli, LSE \- showed that unemployment adjustments were disproportionately concentrated on the low\-skilled \(employment sorting on the basis of education\). 

 Following his appointment to an Independent Experts Committee, convened by government to make a recommendation on minimum wage reform, Monastiriotis embarked upon new research \- **\[4\]**, in collaboration with Dr Andreas Georgiadis, Brunel University London \(lead researcher\) and Dr Ioannis Kaplanis, Athens University of Economics and Business \- on the impact of past minimum wage changes in Greece on wages and employment. He also carried out research \- **\[5\]**, in collaboration with Dr Ioannis Laliotis, LSE \- which fed directly into the work of the Committee, examining the distribution and characteristics of minimum wage earners and generating forecasts for the wage\-cost effects of a minimum wage increase under different scenarios. Specifically: 

-  The aim of **\[4\]** was to produce new, robust evidence on the impact of minimum wages on wages and employment, with which to inform policy – filling a very large gap of empirical evidence for Greece and connecting the findings from the international literature to the Greek case. Using a large sample of administrative social security records and state\-of\-the art econometric methods \(differential trend adjusted Diff\-in\-Diff\), it examined two episodes of minimum wage increases in 2009 and 2011 \(by 5.5% and 1.6% respectively\) as well as the very sizeable 2012 decrease \(by 22% for those aged 25 and above, and by 32% for the youth subminimum, introduced for under\-25s\). The key findings were as follows: 

1.  minimum wage rises led to wage increases for larger groups of workers \(i.e. not only those originally paid below the new level of the minimum wage\), but the size of such wage “spillovers” dissipated around the median of the wage distribution. 

1.  minimum wages do not have a systematic, significant effect on the employment opportunities of low\-wage workers, or on the number of jobs offered by low\-wage businesses. 

 In combination, these findings implied that a prospective minimum wage increase could raise the incomes of the low\-paid without significant effects on employment and with only limited wage\-cost spillovers to the rest of the wage distribution. 

-  **\[5\]** examined data from the Labour Force Survey to identify the characteristics of minimum\-wage earners \(e.g. married/single, age profile, education level, etc.\) and the sectors/occupations where they work. It also included a simulation analysis of the impact of prospective minimum wage increases under different policy scenarios, including that of a 10% increase in the minimum wage with full compliance in its implementation and concurrent abolition of the youth subminimum. The results indicated that such an increase would: 

  -  raise the wages of between 17.8% \(direct effect\) and 31.2% of all private sector employees \(depending on assumptions about the extent of wage spillovers: from zero to those found in **\[4\]**\). 

  -  contribute significantly to reducing wage inequalities among individuals \(including of the types observed in **\[1\]** and **\[2\]**\). 

  -  do so with minimal total\-economy cost implications \(estimated economy\-wide wage\-cost increase of between 1.82% and 3.10%, depending on different spillover scenarios\). It also identified the type of sectors and businesses that would be most affected by such an increase. 

 Overall, this body of work provided key insights on the state of the Greek labour market, offering a convincing conclusion that a carefully increased minimum wage could lead to increases in the wages of a large number of low\-wage workers and a reduction in wage inequality, with only negligible effects on the demand for labour and total\-economy wage costs. Monastiriotis’ input was leading in papers **\[3\]** and **\[5\]**, complementary in paper **\[4\]** \(leader: Georgiadis\), and of equal weight in papers **\[1\]** and **\[2\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins> *Context*</ins> 

 In 2008 Greece suffered an economic crisis, precipitating an unprecedented recession and leading to the introduction of a structural adjustment programme agreed by the Greek Government and a “Troika” of institutions \(European Commission, European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund\) in 2010. As part of the programme, in 2012 the Greek Government enforced a minimum wage reduction across all employees and introduced a lower subminimum for those under 25. The reduced minimum wage remained in force until completion of the structural adjustment programme in September 2018. 

 At this point, and given that the Greek economy had exhibited signs of recovery \(positive economic growth and declining unemployment\) since 2016, the Greek Government initiated a review of the minimum wage. This included the establishment of an Independent Experts Committee entrusted with the mandate of making a ""corroborated recommendation"" to the government on the level of the statutory minimum wage. Monastiriotis was appointed as member to this Committee by the then Minister of Labour, Social Security and Social Solidarity, Dr Efi Achtsioglou, on the basis of his expertise and academic research **\[1\] \[2\] \[3\]** on the Greek labour market **\[A\] \[B\] \[C\]** and his contribution to public debates on the issue **\[D\]**. 

 <ins> *Links between research and impact*</ins> 

 Work by the Committee included both policy analysis and primary research. The latter, led by Monastiriotis **\[5\]**, provided detailed evidence on the potential economic impacts of a minimum wage increase under different scenarios and was ultimately included as Section 6 of the Committee Report **\[E\]**. The results were discussed extensively with government officials as well as members of the Troika **\[F\]** and played a key role in informing the subsequent policy decision on the minimum wage, as attested to by the Ministers of Labour **\[B\]** and Finance **\[C\]** and the Resident Representative of the European Commission in Greece **\[G\]**. Moreover, the results fed directly into the Committee Report **\[E\]**, guiding to a large extent its recommendation. 

 The independent research of Monastiriotis and his co\-authors **\[4\]** also directly influenced policy discussions. As was publicly acknowledged by the then Minister of Labour: “ *at a time when existing evidence was scarce, **\[4\]** provided the ministry with a clear direction on how much the minimum wage should be raised*” **\[H\] \[I\]**. Moreover, the evidence deriving from the underpinning research was critical in influencing the policy recommendations of the Experts Committee. Indeed, the Committee’s Final Report made direct reference to **\[4\]** in its justification of its reasoning concerning its recommendation to the government \(Section 7\) **\[E\]**. The Committee’s recommendations were further scrutinised by the Troika institutions. The evidence provided by **\[5\]** was an important point of discussion in support of these recommendations **\[F\]**. 

 Combined, these two outputs \( **\[4\]** and **\[5\]**\) proved crucial to the subsequent policy change, as they provided a robust evidence base which countered the prevailing international policy advice of the time, including that of the IMF **\[J\]**. Media analysis was no more optimistic, with the chief economics commentator at the *Financial Times* warning of the “threat” of “backsliding on policy” **\[K\]**. 

 <ins> *Impact*</ins> 

 Drawing on the aforementioned research links, the Committee’s recommendation concluded that an increase in the minimum wage by 10% would: 

1.  impact significantly on the incidence of low pay \(directly affecting the pay of an estimated 17.8% of all private sector employees and generating smaller pay increases for up to a further 13.4% of private sector employees\); but 

1.  have minimal adverse employment effects and broadly manageable effects on production costs \(raising the total wage\-bill in the economy by no more than 3.1%\) \(also outlined in Section 7 of the Report **\[E\]**\). 

 Acting on this recommendation, in January 2018 the Greek government decided to raise the statutory minimum wage by 10.9%, effective from 1 February 2019, and to abolish the youth subminimum \(a *de facto* overall increase of 27.2% for those younger than 25\) **\[L\]**. 

 The impact of this policy change on the economy and on individuals has been consistent with expectations outlined in the underpinning research. Estimates of the number of individuals whose pay has been directly influenced by the increase in the minimum wage are in the area of 600,000 **\[M\]**, while, additionally, the increase in the minimum wage is estimated to have benefitted between 200,000 and 300,000 individuals who are in receipt of social benefits \(unemployment, maternity, etc.\) which are indexed on the minimum wage **\[N\] \[O\] \[P\]**. According to the then Minister of Labour, “ *the policy contributed to reducing the risk of poverty for a very sizeable number of households in the country as well as to decreasing wage inequality*” **\[B\]**. 

 Concerning the overall impacts on the economy, the data from the Ministry of Labour on employment flows between January 2019 \(just before the minimum wage increase was enacted\) and February 2020 \(one year after the reform\), suggest that employment grew by 157,000 **\[Q\]**. Moreover, data from the Hellenic Statistical Authority show that, between January and December 2019, unemployment declined from 18.6% to 16.3% **\[R\]**; while between the last quarter of 2018 \(before the reform\) and the last quarter of 2019 \(latest data, year\-on\-year change\) the Wage\-costs Index rose by only 2.4% **\[S\]**; i.e. not too different from the rate predicted by Monastiriotis’ analysis in **\[5\]**. Importantly, the policy was maintained by the new government that came to power in 2019 **\[T\]**. More recently, the findings presented in **\[4\]** also featured in the latest report by the Group of Experts convened to consider options for reform of the French minimum wage \( **\[U\]**, pp. 113\-114\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 St Andrews research on classical Greek and Roman drama has informed and transformed knowledge, attitudes and practice in the creative arts and educational sectors, specifically among two user groups \(i\) teachers and pupils in the secondary sector, in 13 schools in both the UK and in Italy, and \(ii\) UK practitioners in professional and community\-based theatre, dance and music. Teacher training events and written resources have led to changes in teaching practice. Hesk’s work has influenced the productions of two professional theatre companies. Finally, workshops and performances have helped local learners develop new understandings of ancient drama. Both user groups have updated and enriched their work through close engagement with Hesk and Pezzini’s nuanced interpretations of the meaning and contemporary salience of Greek dramas, Roman comedies and their original contexts of performance and reception. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Misconceptions about classical drama have stemmed from a historic failure to read it within its own socio\-political and cultural contexts. Between 2000 and 2020, Hesk and Pezzini have published world\-leading research to correct these misconceptions, under the umbrella \(since 2017\) of the Centre for the Public Understanding of Greek and Roman Drama \(CPUGRD\). The research has had two major purposes: \(1\) to challenge oversimplified understandings of the nature and function of Greek drama, and \(2\) to broaden understanding of Roman comedy, particularly regarding its connection to culture and identity struggles of the Roman Republic, and the challenges of the evolving Roman society of the time. Overall, this body of research is distinctive for its ability to balance two complementary yet rarely combined approaches:  advancing knowledge of how ancient drama was experienced and understood in its original context/s, with a sensitivity to the continuing meaningfulness and relevance of ancient drama, even in and up to our own time. 

  

 **Greek drama**: Hesk has employed contextualist approaches to show the significant place of drama in ancient Athenian society. Hesk’s research identifies how Athenian drama addressed the challenges of citizenship in the world’s first participatory democracy. His first monograph analysed Greek dramatic representations of deception \(R1\); his book\-length study of Sophocles’ *Ajax* interrogated the play’s presentation of individual reputation and responsibility \(R2\); some of his more recent research demonstrates that Greek tragedy and Aristophanic comedy \(R3\) had a fundamental concern with ‘pathologies’ of leadership, debate and decision\-making which were salient to the everyday experience of its audience. Hesk shows that it was *tragedy* which directly engaged both ordinary and elite Athenians’ role as decision\-makers in the city’s democratic\-deliberative institutions. 

 **Roman comedy**: Pezzini’s research also has a strong historical and contextual approach aimed at reconstructing the public dimension of Roman comedy, focusing in particular on two different but ultimately related strands. First, his philological works \(including most prominently R4\), which adopt a strong socio\-linguistic approach, have shown how particular features of comic language reflect important social and political concerns of the time. These include, above all, the Roman attempts, encouraged by the political elite, to develop a literary language that could vie with the Greek, as well as the efforts to promote Latin to the top of the multi\-lingual pyramid of the contemporary society. Second, his articles on key literary features of Roman comedy \(realism and absence, R5 and R6\) have revealed neglected connections between the dramatic fabric of the genre and the main anxieties of contemporary Roman society, especially including the problematic relationship between \(Roman\) masters and \(Greek\) slaves, miscommunication in a heavily\-biased society, and the inter\-generational struggles between a relatively uneducated, old\-fashioned age group, and a new generation imbued by Greek culture.

","
 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The Greek and Roman research described in Section 2 has **informed the teaching of ancient drama in 13 English, Scottish and Italian schools**. Here, the beneficiaries have been by turns both pupils, who have found new ways of expression through Greek drama, and teachers, who have changed their pedagogical practice as a result of Hesk and Pezzini’s interventions. The research has also **changed the creative practice of theatre professionals**. Three groups of theatre practitioners \(Byre Youth and Community Arts, St Andrews, Scotland; NMTAutomatics, a theatre company in England; Fleur Darkin and Amy Hodge, another theatre group in England\) have transformed their working practice through deep consultation with Hesk regarding his underpinning research on Greek drama. In the case of NMTA, the knowledge and consultation provided by Hesk has undergirded “ *the transformation of NMT Automatics from a fledgling theatre company, into an impressive arts organisation*” \(Director of NMTA\) \(S1\). 

 **1. Informing the teaching of ancient drama in selected English, Scottish and Italian schools** 

 Hesk and Pezzini have worked with secondary school teachers and students not only to influence pedagogy on their specific areas of research expertise, but also to incorporate lasting curriculum change and to use the results of university research more widely in their practice. These activities have been concentrated mainly on Scotland and Italy, because these are the networks most readily available to Hesk and Pezzini. But they have also made efforts to inform teaching practice in England too, as the next section attests. 

 <ins>Changing the pedagogy of Greek drama through learning resources</ins> 

 Downloadable briefing sheets for UK secondary school teachers have changed the pedagogy of Greek drama, with 295 downloads and counting \(NB: these numbers **exclude** downloads from links embedded in emails, blogs, other websites, social media posts, and javascript\-disabled browsers\). For example, the Head of History and Classics at Longsands Academy in St Neots used these sheets \(based on R3\) with 60 people \(students\) over 6 years. This resulted in greater understanding for students:  “ *As far as teaching the plays to students, the articles were a godsend. I was able to articulate more clearly that Aristophanes was not just “funny”, but serious as well. However, by using sheets like ‘Satire and Seriousness’, it was easy for the students to see that there are different views about the levels of seriousness, and that different scholars disagree on why this is*.” \(S2\) The sheets also helped teachers gain a greater understanding of the subject: “ *Hesk’s article on ‘Combative Capping’ was especially helpful in understanding the role of Better and Worse in the play, and how their capping fitted in with the larger agons later in the play*.” \(S2\) The Head of History and Classics at Longsands Academy found the sheets also ‘invaluable’ in ‘updating and transforming’ the subject knowledge of a colleague who had not taught Classics for 30 years. \(S2\) 

 In addition to these permanently available resources embedded into the Centre for the Public Understanding of Greek and Roman Drama website, 77 people \(school students\) at Royal High Edinburgh and Mackie Academy Aberdeen have benefited from a module closely based on R2 devised by Hesk in collaboration with Undergraduate Research Assistants. The Principal Teacher of Developing the Young Workforce at Mackie Academy highlights that Hesk’s “ *specific arguments…about the flawed nature of Ajax’s heroic identity changed the students’ understanding of the nature of ancient Greek heroism across their other texts. They moved from judging Greek tragic figures by their own, modern and personal concepts of heroism to a more nuanced understanding of these figures’ complexity as products of their environment*” and that “ *the direct relevance to the syllabus engendered pupil discussion and confidence, encouraging pupils to take greater ownership of their intellectual responses to ancient texts. It also improved the quality of the discussion*” \(S3\). She also remarks on her own changed practice and understanding: “ *greater confidence in engaging classes with questioning and analysis of Classical Literature, developed skills in delivering discussion based pupil workshops and introducing and engaging pupils with academic level texts in preparation for Further Education experiences*”. \(S3\) This is echoed by the Teacher of RMPS and Classical Studies at Royal High Edinburgh: “ *my collaboration with Jon Hesk has already changed the way I incorporate research into my pedagogy”* \(S4, pg 6\). 

 <ins>Developing curricula and student engagement with ancient comedy</ins> 

 Hesk and Pezzini have influenced the pedagogy of 30 people \(Latin and Greek teachers\) across 7 schools in Sicily, which has in turn led to a change in their students’ thinking on the topics of Greek and Roman Comedy. These students would not ordinarily have access to cutting edge research from UK academics. Classics teachers who participated in Hesk and Pezzini’s workshop attested an immediate effect: one teacher felt they ‘ *acquired a greater understanding of the realism of comic theatre’,* another that their *‘perception of ancient comedy \[had been\] enriched’,* and that they *‘will strive to encourage students to read comedies…more than they do now*”. \(S5, p. 2, 3 & 6\) The pedagogical change has also been longer lasting. Teachers at the Istituto Superiore Giovanni XXIII\-Cosentino \(one of the 7 schools\) have immediately incorporated Hesk and Pezzini’s research findings on Aristophanes and Terence into their teaching \(of approximately 4,000 people \(school pupils\)\); and have confirmed that other schools have ‘implemented similar changes’ in their curriculum \(S5, p. 1\). This has resulted in a pool of at least 5,000 people \(Italian school students\) thinking about Aristophanic Comedy and Roman comedy in new ways. 

-  The primary vehicle for these shifts was a two\-day event on classical comedy \( *Vis Comica on the Stage*\) at Marsala, Sicily, in March 2019. In addition to the 30 people \(teachers\) from 7 schools, 200 people \(secondary school students\) attended. The core of the event consisted in two keynote lectures from Hesk and Pezzini incorporating material from R3 and R5, as well as sustained engagement over the full two days. 

1.  **Changing the creative process in theatre communities** 

 Hesk and Pezzini have used their research to shift the practice of 3 theatre organisations and 134 people: 4 young adults actors and 130 secondary school participants \(10 teachers, 120 students\). This has taken the form of **changes in new production processes for theatre groups, development of artistic and educational techniques**, **increased** **student facility with practical drama**, and **improvement in the** **understanding and perception of Greek and Roman drama**. 

 Hesk has collaborated closely with NMT Automatics Theatre Company, an emerging London based theatre company whose work has been called ‘gripping, bold and exciting’. The artistic director and choreographer from this theatre group – specialising in staging ancient myths and epics via drama, song and dance – consulted with Hesk and others for two significant periods in April and August 2019. As a result, NMT Automatics have created a new production closely informed by Hesk’s research \(R2: ‘Tempus Fugit: Tales from Troy’, performed at the British Museum on February 22, 2020 \( [https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/troy\-myth\-and\-reality](https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/troy-myth-and-reality)\). NMTA’s testimony says Hesk’s research\-based consultation “ *completely re\-shaped the way in which we approached our company’s fourth show, Tempus Fugit, in that it enabled us to find complexities and richness in the themes and subject matter before translating our reading into physical theatre, rather than attempting to stage a play and then coming back to deal with authenticity*” \(S1\). This change in practice is ongoing: Hesk and NMTA collaborated \(along with König: see Coulston and König REF2021 UoA29 ICS, “Shaping modern perceptions of military culture through Roman experiences”\) on the Army’s virtual Edinburgh Fringe Festival event in August 2020. Consultations continue into 2021. 

-  Similarly, Hesk has had a direct influence \(using R3\) on the research and development for Fleur Darkin and Amy Hodge’s planned new production of Aristophanes’ *Lysistrata*.  Darkin \(choreographer\) and Hodge \(director\) are an established theatre team, whose recent National Theatre production \( *Mr Gum and the Dancing Bear – The Musical\!*\) was nominated for an Olivier Award for Best Family Show 2020. Hesk’s influence goes beyond their *Lysistrata* production currently in development, to affect Darkin and Hodge’s very mode of artistic production. Sustained conversations between Hesk, Darkin and Hodge over R3 “ *allowed us to radically rethink our writing process for the adaptation of Lysistrata and gives us the keys to look at co\-authoring a new work inspired by the processes that created these works, as opposed to just working with translation in a word\-for\-word, faithful \(or slavish\) way*.” The experience has shifted the way these theatre professionals approach ancient material in their work: “ *This research has empowered us to take on the texts with confidence as we seek to interpret them as relevant to our contemporary world*” … “ *This research has been crucial and important, and fundamentally changes our approach to adaptation for stage*.” \(S6\) 

 Hesk’s work has also triggered an ongoing change in practice for an influential community theatre educator, the Theatre Arts Practitioner at Byre Youth and Community Arts. Working closely with this practitioner over the period of February to June 2017, Hesk used his research findings on Greek tragedy \(R1 and R2\) to achieve longlasting effects on the Byre practitioner’s artistic and pedagogical ‘toolbox’: “ *this project and the research insights which it was designed to deliver have offered me a completely new set of approaches and resources to add to my ‘toolbox’ as a professional theatre educator who works with young people in a variety of settings*.” \(S7, p. 3\) Hesk’s work has generated in the Byre practitioner a ‘profound realisation’ about the centrality of theatre to polis life in ancient Athens, and has resulted in his incorporating new pedagogical techniques \(e.g., the integration of ‘more ‘choral’ movement and voicework into my teaching and mentoring’\). This change in practice has affected 90 people \(students\) per year since 2017. \(S7, p. 2\) 

 Hesk has also changed the way a group of 4 people \(young adults\) engage with Greek drama. These young people were all in sixth form or Further Education courses from across Fife and Tayside, and all had very limited access to classical drama prior to this project. Hesk’s work led to a realisation among them that tragedy can still be a politically relevant art form today. This was achieved through St Andrews Classics’ flagship collaboration with Byre Youth and Community Arts, an independent community group, in 2017, entitled ‘Greek Drama in the Community’. Hesk drew on the insights of R1 and R2 to help the young adult amateur practitioners produce an original theatre production, *Hamartia.* Via their sustained discussions and formal talks involved in the production of *Hamartia*, the practitioners realised that Greek tragic forms and themes can become the building blocks for a serious drama about politics and ecology. As one student said of the experience: “ *the theme of deception became so important in our play \[…\] It made us happier with our ideas when we made connections to what Jon had been talking about*”. The Byre practitioner affirms: “ *this workshop made a big impact on the students and changed the direction of their devised piece considerably*”. \(S7, p. 2 & 3\) 

 The Byre theatre was also the venue for the rare performance of the Roman comedy Plautus’ *Menaechmi* in 2019, for which Pezzini was the main academic consultant, drawing on R4, R5 and R6. This was the first ever public performance of this play in Scotland, and the first in Britain since 1979. The show attracted an exeptionally large audience of 378 people \(general public\) at two public performances \(a typical theatre performance at the Byre attracts only 86 people on average\). In addition, a matinee performance and workshop for 130 people \(participants: 10 teachers, 120 students\) from 3 local primary and secondary schools from Fife and Dundee, Scotland \(S8\). Pezzini drew on R5 for the workshop talk, and students came out with a new appreciation of the continuing relevance of Roman comedy: one student singled out how well the workshop presentation related Roman comedy to the present day, another how they learned that ‘Roman theatre has had an effect on how we act in theatre today’, another how ‘people back then found similar things funny to what we do now’. \(S8, pp. 15, 29, 51\) 25% of students surveyed \(9% of the total\) said they learned ‘a lot’ \(the highest descriptor available in the feedback forms\) from Roman theatre in general thanks to the event. 50% of students surveyed said it helped them understand Roman theatre better; 34% said it made them realise how little things had changed from the past; and 14% said it helped them understand how comedy works. \(S8\) The event also shifted the perception of the school teachers themselves, one of whom was particularly impressed by how the presentations “ *made the performance meaningful and relevant to our students*”. \(S8, p. 41\)

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Birmingham has improved the management of patients with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension \(IIH\) by achieving the following: 

1.  **Improved patient outcomes**, including reducing episodes of blindness, fewer lumbar punctures, surgical procedures and hospital admissions; 

1.  **Development of the first International and European clinical guidelines for IIH**; 

1.  **International change in clinical practice for the management of IIH patients**; 

1.  **Creation of a spin\-out company** to bring new drugs to patients. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Idiopathic intracranial hypertension \(IIH\) is a condition of unknown aetiology characterised by raised intracranial pressure \(ICP\). It is a disease of socioeconomic deprivation mainly affecting obese young women \(95% of cases\) and causing severe disabling headaches which reduce quality of life and can ultimately lead to blindness. The incidence of IIH has risen rapidly and is currently estimated to be 1 in 20,000, a 100% increase in the last decade, rising in line with global obesity. This has resulted in a 446% increase in associated UK hospital costs, with hospital economic burden rising from £9.2M in 2002 to £49.9M in 2014 \[S1\]. 

 Current therapies for IIH have poor efficacy and tolerability, and 48% of patients discontinue treatment. There are currently no targeted treatments to prevent blindness or severe disabling headache and, lacking an evidence base, international patient management strategies are highly variable. These factors have combined to perpetuate poor outcomes for patients — 25% of patients will have permanent visual loss as a result of optic disc swelling and the majority having chronic disabling headaches. High intracranial pressure is usually diagnosed by performing a lumbar puncture. This procedure also acts as an important treatment although some patients require neurosurgery with intraventricular shunt insertion to release the pressure. 

 Although the vast majority of patients with IIH are obese, there was previously a lack of firm evidence that weight loss improved the condition. Sinclair developed a cohort of 25 women with active, chronic \(over three months\) IIH and identified **that 15% weight loss led to disease remission**, as evidenced by a **significant reduction in ICP** and **optic disc swelling \(papilloedema\)** measured by optical coherence tomography \(OCT\) \[R1\]. 

 In a further study, Sinclair then demonstrated for the first time that the use of OCT **to monitor papilloedema was beneficial** in clinical practice as an effective surrogate for raised ICP \[R2\]. For patients with sight\-threatening IIH, neurosurgical shunting procedures are performed to prevent blindness. However, there was previously no guidance to determine when this procedure should be undertaken, leading to many unnecessary surgical interventions. Sinclair reported on many potentially life\-changing complications as a result of surgery, including blockage \(12%\), disconnection \(7%\) and infection \(8%\) with 51% of shunts failing and needing revision surgery within a year. The study concluded that **shunt surgery** **should only be performed to preserve rapidly declining vision**, and was not appropriate in other settings which could be managed medically, indicating that clinical practice needed to change \[R3\]. 

 In a patient and physician research partnership, Sinclair also identified that patients were experiencing significant complications from lumbar punctures, including severe pain \(40%\) and extreme anxiety \(47%\) \[R4,  [Patient experience of lumbar puncture](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2018/03/05/alex-sinclair-and-sandra-doughty-illuminating-the-patient-experience-of-lumbar-puncture/)\] and furthermore illustrated **lack of efficacy** with headache exacerbation in 64%. The study concluded that performing repeated lumbar punctures in IIH should stop \[R5\]. 

 There are no licenced drugs to treat IIH. Sinclair identified the **therapeutic potential of** **exenatide** a **glucagon\-like peptide 1 receptor agonist to reduce ICP**, through its ability to reduce brain fluid production in animal models \[R6\]. The magnitude of effect is greater than any other drugs used in IIH. Exenatide is currently used for other conditions, and induces significant weight loss, a known disease modifier in IIH. Sinclair then performed a randomised placebo controlled trial in patients with IIH which demonstrated an acute \(24 hours\) and sustained significant reduction in ICP which was maintained for 12 weeks of dosing \(Presented to the 14<sup>th</sup> European Headache Federation Congress in 2019. Abstract in Journal of Headache and Pain 2021 in press\). 

  

 Key findings from the research are summarised below: 

 **KF1.** Weight loss leads to remission of IIH \[R1\]; 

 **KF2.** Optical coherence tomography is beneficial to disease monitoring \[R2\]; 

 **KF3.** Shunt surgery in IIH should only be conducted to preserve vision \[R3\]; 

 **KF4.** Lack of efficacy of Lumbar puncture \(LPs\) in managing IIH \[R4, R5\]; 

 **KF5.** The glucagon\-like peptide 1 receptor agonist \(Exenatide\) is a novel drug strategy to reduce ICP and to treat IIH \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The management and treatment of patients with IIH has been shaped by Sinclair’s research in four key ways. 

 . 

1.  **Improved outcomes and understanding for patients with IIH** 

 Evaluation of UK Health Episodes Statistics data shows the following patient outcomes have improved: 

-  **Reduction in IIH patients registered blind** — from 2.1% prior to 2018 to 1.4% in 2019 \[S1\].  This benefit stems from the adoption of OCT imaging \[R2; KF2\] into practice, which “helps to guide on which patients need shunt surgery to prevent blindness” \(S4\). 

-  **Reduced hospital admissions** as a result of **reductions in lumbar punctures and shunt procedures** \[S1\]: 

  -  Shunting levels were consistently high prior to 2018 but have markedly fallen since, from 8.3% \(2002–2016 \[S1\]\) of IIH patients to 3.1% \(2018–2019, \[S1\]\); 

-  Shunt revision rates falling from 2.8% to 0.6%, reflecting revision of shunt for visual issues/visual failure only \[S1\]; 

-  The proportion of patients requiring re\-admissions for IIH, within one year of diagnosis, has also decreased from 38% \(2002–2016\) to 35% \(2018–2019\), whilst reductions in the proportions of patients requiring >2 admissions to hospital per year has fallen from 11.9% \(2002–2016\) to 9.3% \(2018–2019\), \[S1\]. These data reflect a reduction in attendance for repeated lumbar puncture and shunt surgery. 

-  Patients can now make more **informed treatment decisions**. For example, it is now clear that weight loss is an important form of disease management and an approach to avoid harmful therapies, such as lumbar punctures and shunt surgery \[R2, R3\]. Evidence that patient knowledge and understanding has markedly improved was demonstrated in spring 2020 using E\-surveys to patients \(465 UK respondents and 115 international respondents\). These documented that patients’ understanding of optimal care has been enhanced \[S2\] with: 

-  99% of respondents now aware of the link between body weight and IIH; 

-  89% aware that surgery should be reserved for people losing vision; 

-  71% aware that there was a limited medical role for LPs. 

 Sinclair reinforced these messages through her role as Patron of the National IIH charity, where patient education was delivered through Question and Answer videos, patient conferences and patient information leaflets published on the charity website \[S3i–ii\]. 

1.  **Development of the first International clinical guidelines to shape IIH patient care and improve patient management** 

 Sinclair led development of the **first international guidelines for IIH** \[S4i–iv\], published in 2018. Prior to this, there was no standardised care for management of IIH and practices varied widely around the globe.  Sinclair was then commissioned to **produce the European Headache Federation IIH guideline** \[S4ii\] \(2018\).  Recommendations include: 

1.  “Primary principle for IIH management: modify the underlying disease through weight loss” \[S4i, page 1092; S4ii, page 10; R1\]; 

1.  That OCT should be introduced for objective monitoring of papilloedema \[S4i, page 1090; S4ii, page 3; R2\]; 

1.  That shunting surgery should only be conducted to preserve vision \[S4i, page1093–4; S4ii, page 7–8; R3\], and make firm recommendations to change practice in patient management; 

1.  That “Serial lumbar punctures are not recommended for management of IIH” \[S4i, page 1095; S4ii, page 11; R4, R5\). 

1.  **International change in clinical practice for the management of IIH patients** 

 Patient care practices and services have been redesigned both nationally and internationally, in line with the service set up by Sinclair at the University of Birmingham \(the largest in Europe\). 

 Clinical practice has changed in three key ways: 

1.  **Pathways for weight loss have been introduced** \[R1; KF1\]. The percentage of patients with recorded weight counselling has risen since 2018 \[S1\]. Data from the patient e\-survey indicated that >50% of patients felt the guidelines had helped doctors to improve their care, in key areas such as weight management \[S2\]. 

1.  **OCT has been introduced for objective monitoring of papilloedema** \[R2; KF2\]. That this is the case is confirmed by Professor of Neurology at the Danish Headache Center University of Copenhagen \(2021, \[S5\]\) who states “These changes to patient care, detailed in the IIH guidelines, have led to redesign of routine care pathways globally to improve patient outcomes. Internationally we have adopted the use of OCT image to monitor papilloedema in clinics.  This has had the benefits of reducing the need for painful LPs and helps to guide on which patients need shunt surgery to prevent blindness” \[S1\]. 

1.  **Collaborative working takes place between multiple specialities.** A multidisciplinary team approach bringing together neurology, ophthalmology, neurosurgery and dietetics has been adopted to allow the correct selection of patients for shunt surgery \[R3; KF3\].  This approach was identified as important during the James Lind Priority setting Partnership 2018 “multidisciplinary clinics were scored as important” \[page 4, S6\] and change is evidenced by a reduction in shunt procedures and reduced shunt revisions, alongside reduced rates of blindness seen in patients \[S1\].  International change is further attested to by Professor of Neurology at the Danish Headache Center University of Copenhagen \(2021\) who states “The change in practice to bring together neurologists, ophthalmologists, and neurosurgeons to work more closely together in a multi\-specialty team has dramatically improved patient care and outcomes and is now a core principle of IIH clinical pathways”. 

1.  **Bringing new drugs to patients through the creation of a University of Birmingham spin\-out company** 

 Significant commercial impact has stemmed from Sinclair’s findings that exenatide can reduce ICP \[R6; KF5\]. Working with University of Birmingham Enterprise Sinclair has: 

-  Secured intellectual property through filing and the granting of a method of use patent; 

-  Obtained orphan drug designation \(ODD\) granted by the FDA and European Medicines Agency \(2017\) \[S7i\]; 

-  Undertaken a proof of concept clinical trial that has culminated in raising significant funding \(round 1 $AU12M \+ round 2 $AU26M\) to create a University of Birmingham spin\-out company, Invex Therapeutics \[S7ii\] to repurpose exenatide specifically for IIH \[S7iii\]. The company was launched on the Australian Stock market in July 2019 \[S7iv–v\] and current value \(19/11/2020\) was Market cap value £29.9M, Enterprise value £15.5M, revenue £91.3k and share value o **f $AU0.8 \[S7vi\].** The company is about to initiate manufacture of the drug Presendin \(reformulated to specifically control ICP\) which will be used in a phase 1 and a large phase 3 international randomised controlled trial in IIH \[S7ii\].  Sinclair is working with the FDA and EMA to file an investigational new drug application \(IND\) and establish trials to enable market authorisation and licencing of the drug for IIH patients. This will be the first licenced drug for IIH and a step\-change in improving patient care.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A government survey of cyber security threats in 2020 states that almost half of businesses \(46%\) report having cyber security breaches or attacks in the last 12 months, at an estimated average cost of £3,230 per breach. Collaborative research between academia and business led to the development of an information assurance standard for SMEs and an associated business which subsequently was utilised by government as the basis of a national cyber security standard, Cyber Essentials. This product has been adopted by companies large and small and has mitigated future losses for these companies by enhancing their cyber security systems and protocols. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Henson was the researcher on a project led by the National Computing Centre funded by the Technology Strategy Board to investigate and understand barriers to SMEs engaging with cyber security and to develop an appropriate cyber security standard, risk assessment tool and a scalable and sustainable business model for SMEs \(Grant 1\). 

 It was apparent from the start that there were two core challenges: 

-  Existing Information Assurance Standards \(BS7799 and ISO27001\) were of limited value to SMEs, given the cost of engaging with these standards. 

-  Whilst cyber risks were real and increasing \(both for businesses themselves and supply chain partners\) and businesses were ill\-prepared to meet them, SMEs were reluctant to invest even limited time and money in information assurance, seeing this non\-investment as an acceptable strategic risk. This was elaborated and expanded in a later paper \(see Reference 3\). 

 The standard \(available on request\), known as IASME \(Information Assurance for Small and Medium\-sized Enterprises\), co\-produced by the project team and developed through a pilot with 15 SMEs in the West Midlands, was launched in 2011. It consisted of an assessment and formal certification of the level of maturity of an SME’s cyber security that was assurance for itself and its customers. The rationale for this product and the process by which it was developed in described in Reference 1, one of several conference presentations, academic and business, the project team delivered in 2011. 

 The product was well\-received and the decision was taken to establish IASME as a company in 2012. The IASME model assumed that assessors would work with the SME, taking them through the requirements for certification including gap analysis. To make IASME scalable, more assessors would be needed; the university agreed to host the assessor training. However, in spite of the positive feedback from businesses and information assurance experts, the take up of the project was limited because of the cost of assessment. At this point self\-assessment was seen as an unacceptable compromise to the model as there was little incentive for SMEs to be honest in their assessment. 

 Further research found a solution to this. By building cyber liability insurance into the model, a self\-assessment model could be used as clients would only be given insurance cover if they had a base level of cyber security; further, if they went beyond this base level, they would receive a discount \(Reference 2\). Following this, IASME was relaunched in 2013 at reduced costs with a self\-assessment process with insurance included as part of the package.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research described in section 2 has underpinned the following impacts: 

-  Creation of a new business, IASME Consortium Limited, which has grown significantly in the assessment period and been recognised nationally for its work 

-  Development and delivery of a new government\-backed Cyber Security product, Cyber Essentials, which has been a key part of the government’s Cyber Security Strategy over the assessment period 

-  Mitigation of future losses through improved risk assessment and management of information for businesses who have engaged with Cyber Essentials 

-  Contribution to enhanced knowledge and understanding of cyber security risks among businesses and charities 

 The IASME Consortium Ltd was incorporated in January 2012. It has grown significantly over the last 9 years: by 2020, it worked alongside a network of over 250 Certification Bodies across the UK and Crown Dependencies. Its achievements in the field have been recognised at the National Cyber Awards 2019, where it was named Cyber Business of the Year. 

 The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills made a call for evidence on a preferred standard for cyber security in 2013. The findings of this call \(Source A\) and the government response \(Source B\) were published in November 2013. The report highlighted the strengths of IASME as a product and the government response identified IASME as one of a small number of tenable models. The outcome of the call was to develop a new preferred standard working with IASME and the Information Security Forum; the value of IASME in this process was highlighted because of the simplicity of the model and its relevance to small businesses thus aligning with government’s 2011 Cyber Security Strategy which highlighted the specific need to make sure that SMEs are aware of cyber security risks and that they benefit explicitly from policy and practice. 

 The new standard,  [Cyber Essentials](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview), was launched in 2014 as a product of collaboration between government, IASME and ISF \(Source C\). The product, backed by the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses and a number of insurance organisations, provided a simple, low\-cost set of basic technical controls to help organisations, large and small, to protect themselves against common online security threats. As such, it owed a great deal to the original IASME model. 

 From October 2014, Government required all suppliers bidding for contracts involving the handling of certain sensitive and personal information to be certified against the Cyber Essentials scheme. Subsequently, commitment was made by a number of large employers \(e.g. Airbus, Barclays, BT, Vodafone\) to encourage their suppliers to engage with Cyber Essentials \(Source D\). 

 A 2016 Government Cyber Health Check and Cyber Security Breaches Survey, highlighted the value of the scheme: 

 *“Last year, the average cost of breaches to large businesses that had them was £36,500. For small firms the average cost of breaches was £3,100. 65% of large organisations reported they had suffered an information security breach in the past year, and 25% of these experienced a breach at least once a month. Nearly seven out of ten attacks involved viruses, spyware or malware that might have been prevented using the Government’s Cyber Essentials scheme”* \(Source E\). 

 In October 2019, it was announced the IASME Consortium had won the 5\-year contract to be the National Cyber Security Centre’s Cyber Essentials Partner from April 2020 \(Source F\). 60,000 certificates have been issued since its initial implementation and currently around 1500 new businesses are being certified every month. 

 Surveys undertaken for government on cyber security breaches in 2016 and 2020 \(Sources G and H\) have demonstrated the growth, from 48% to 51%, in businesses’ knowledge and understanding of the five technical controls embedded in Cyber Essentials even where those companies do not necessarily have accreditation. This highlights the effectiveness of Cyber Essentials in raising awareness of cyber security risks and potential mitigations.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of punk in the UK was celebrated in 2016 with a year\-long series of events in London which many in the punk community felt did not represent their past in a culturally appropriate way. The representation of subcultures has long been problematic, as by their very nature they tend to avoid engaging with the establishment \(academia\) or commerce. Worley’s grassroots approach to research offered an alternative narrative in the build\-up to the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary by overcoming the barrier between the punk subculture and the establishment. Worley’s research has helped people to reimagine and thus have a richer understanding of British punk\-related cultures and British youth culture more generally. His participatory approach to social history has had a profound effect on this traditionally hard to reach community.  He has influenced participants’ behaviour and that of stakeholders in the cultural, archival and commercial sectors; contributed to entrepreneurial activity; and stimulated local tourism by generating events and exhibitions. Most importantly, he has helped to preserve, conserve and present a cultural legacy that has generated new forms of historical practice and creative expression. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Worley has led research on the history of subcultures through a Leverhulme funded project: Punk, Politics and British Youth Culture 1975\-85 \(2013\-15\) that examined the relationship between  [youth cultures, politics and social change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5Ohxn1pJH8). To underpin this work, Worley co\-founded the Interdisciplinary Network for the Study of Subcultures, Popular Music and Social Change \(Subcultures Network\) in 2011, funded by an AHRC Network Grant and hosted by the University of Reading. The Network’s aims were to promote and facilitate research exploring the ways in which subcultures and popular music serve as mediums for social change; to encourage interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches to the study of subcultures, popular music and social change; to initiate and sustain a dialogue between scholars whose work focuses on subjects relating to subcultures, popular music and social change through regular workshops, symposia and conferences; to provide support and opportunities for peer\-review towards funding proposals related to the study of subcultures, popular music and social change; to instigate and amass a significant body of scholarly work examining the relationship between subcultures, popular music and social change. These aims were primarily achieved through a series of symposia between 2013 and 2015 and resulted in a series of publications \(outputs 1–6\): 

-  Riotous Youth \(October 2013, Bristol\) 

-  Sound Affects \(April 2014, Norwich\) 

-  In/between Spaces \(September 2014, Liverpool\) 

-  Political Subcultures \(March 2015, Surrey\) 

-  Global Subcultures, Local Identities \(June 2015, West London\) 

 Integral to Worley’s approach has been decentralising the prevailing – media\-driven – narratives of Punk that centred on London and Manchester. Indeed, the Subcultures Network exists to enable academics and cultural practitioners to co\-operate and thereby co\-create histories from materials and experiences embedded in local cultures. By applying this “theory\-into\-practice” approach, the Network has produced a history of punk that is “ours” rather than “mine”, “yours” or “theirs”. 

 The starting point for the project was a study of punk in Norwich. Worley met with members of Norwich’s punk community to discuss gathering material for an article. Further contacts led to reams of ephemera, emerging from private collections and discussions brought forward memories and reminiscences.  Instead of an article, the research generated a historical account that reflected its subject; materials and memories were combined with a historical overview to create a history in fanzine form: Young Offenders: Punk in Norwich, 1976\-84. 

 One of those interviewed was the marketing manager for “Norwich Lanes” who had been a punk himself in his teens. He suggested developing a series of local events to coincide with the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of punk in 2016. Consequently “Punk in the East” was born, and in November 2016, the Norwich Arts Centre hosted a launch event, featuring The Ruts \(whose Norwich gig in 1979 is often cited as one of the most exciting the city has ever hosted\).. Local shops, pubs and cafes in the Norwich Lanes participated to form a trail – hosting photos, ephemera and artworks from the 1970s–80s – highlighting spaces important for the cultivation of punk culture in the region. Through November and December 2016, further gigs and a film show were held, and the Bridewell Museum, Norwich, incorporated a punk display into its “wider social history of Norwich” exhibit. This was curated by erstwhile punks, whose own clothes, records, fanzines and posters formed the displays, representing Norwich youth culture in the 1970s–80s. 

 The project continued to thrive after the anniversary celebrations, enabling ongoing collection of Norfolk’s punk history. In collaboration with the Norwich Museum, which had already provided facilities to scan materials for the events of 2016, a virtual exhibition was devised.  Materials were collated during 2017 and ‘18 and the “Punk in the East” website launched as a living archive in August 2018. Further physical events have since been held under the Punk in the East banner and an event inspired by the project ‘No Glue. No Glass Bottles’ took place in Sunderland in 2017. More recently, Worley’s research and the Subcultures Network, together with the Punk in the East project and website, have inspired the Youth Club Archive’s plans for a Youth Culture Museum. In 2020, a virtual Museum of Youth Culture was launched, and Worley is now working with the Archive towards developing a physical version of the museum.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 In contrast to the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of punk events in London, which many in the subculture felt were imposed on them for commercial gain, the events in Norwich, and those it inspired beyond, were embraced by the former and current members of the punk community, who took ownership of the events as their history. The overarching theme of these projects and events has been to empower individuals with an active interest in their own history to engage with it and share it in ways that resonate with them. 

1.  **Cultural impact on punk subcultures in Norwich and the UK:** 

 To provide an accessible focal point for groups and individuals interested in the work that Worley and the Subcultures Network were doing, a Facebook group was established \(in September 2020 it had 4,300 members, E1\). This provided a forum to discuss ideas for the “Punk in the East” project and enabled and encouraged people to engage in collating and validating their own history, producing and attending events born of their own creative endeavour. The material people shared was initially compiled in a fanzine comprising text and imagery offered by Norwich’s punk community \(E2\). After a run of 500 sold out, a further 500 fanzines were reprinted following requests by local books shops and individuals unable to secure an original copy. 

 Following the first meeting between Worley and the Norwich punks, another Facebook group “Punk in Norwich” was started, and its members continue to engage and share material. It currently has 963 members and serves as space for discussion about punk and its local history \(E1\). A further Facebook page, ‘Punk in the East’, served to promote the project itself and continues to promote related projects into 2020 \(currently 940 followers; E1\). One Norwich schoolboy punk who graduated to Backs Records and London’s Rough Trade, commented: “The \[…\] websites and Facebook pages have been such a great and useful tool in helping me reconnect with my past and engaging with punk history \[…\]. It's been invaluable in helping me remember the gigs, the music, the times and the people and has allowed me to reconnect with lots of people I'd lost touch with years and years ago, and rejuvenated my interest in the whole culture immensely.” \(E3\). 

 The main anniversary events in October\-December 2016 brought together past and present punks and created a sense of ownership of the past within the community. Unlike the officially sanctioned London\-centric “celebrations”, Punk in the East was developed with grass\-roots enthusiasts who had forged punk\-related cultures in Norfolk and nearby in the 1970s–80s. As one contributor \(Stephen Hansell, singer in The Disrupters\) who contributed memorabilia to the exhibition commented: “Back then I never thought for one minute that what we were doing would one day be regarded as social history \[…\] I don't think many people analysed it at the time, I know I didn't, it was just more of a compulsion, a way of life” \(E4\). A  [film of the launch event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrMWztfSxXs) captured the impact made on those attending, with comments showing how Punk in the East reinvigorated their interest, validated their cultural practice, and embodied their youthful experiences \(E5\). 





 The Punk in the East website, launched in August 2018, was collated from within the local community and continues to develop. Photos and images have been contributed by those in and around the city, but also from Britons living around the world who are keen to retain links to their youth and friends. Over 200 people have contributed items to the site to date, with two further large donations of material due to arrive after the coronavirus lockdown. In 2020, the website was receiving about 30 unique visitors a day \(E6\). The exhibition at the Museum of Norwich was curated by those who had amassed private collections or been members of local bands in the 1970s and 1980s. Since the exhibit was first placed in the museum in 2016 there has been a significant increase in footfall and a change in the demographic of visitor over the course of the exhibition \(E7\). 

 Worley’s expertise is widely sought. He has been invited to advise on subsequent local events that have been inspired by the original Punk in the East project and events, such as ‘Punk in the Provinces’ \(Norwich Arts Centre, November 2017 and Q&As with punk luminaries who visited Norwich under the Punk in the East banner. The project has also had significant reach beyond Norwich, inspiring cultural practitioners in Sunderland \(The Bunker Collective\) to devise a similar event \(9 September 2017\), replete with gigs and a website \(E8\). 

 Worley’s work has also influenced and inspired the London\-based Youth Club Archive to develop a Youth Culture Museum. In particular the organisation is adopting Worley’s methodology for community\-based and collaborative collection development, enabling people to take ownership of their social history and inviting the public to submit items to the museum. National Lottery Heritage Funding has been secured and plans are underway to develop the idea from online to a physical museum. The Archivist wrote: “We were incredibly impressed and excited by The Subcultures Network and the brilliant work Matthew Worley and his peers do. \[We\] felt that they were the perfect partners on our National Lottery Heritage Fund project to build the online Museum of Youth Culture. Working with Matthew enabled us to find the right academics and authors to write a narrative and build context to the archive, making the collection more accessible than it’s ever been.” \(E9\). 

 Much media attention was also generated. In Norwich, local TV, radio and print outlets reported on Punk in the East \(e.g. BBC Radio Norfolk interview in November 2016\). On 9–10 January 2018, ITV regional news ran a feature that developed the themes of the project, interviewing Professor Worley and various East Anglian punks to trace the cultural legacies into the twenty\-first century.  Nationally, Worley was interviewed on his wider research project on BBC Radio 6 on 5 April 2018 \(2,560,000 listeners\) and contributed to non\-academic writing events such as Louder Than Words \(Manchester, November 2017\) \(E7\). 

1.  **Socio\-economic impact on Norwich and its cultural venues:** 

 Punk in the East was developed in collaboration with Norwich Lanes and took place in October–December 2016. The launch at Norwich Arts Centre was sold out and attended by 200 people of all ages, among whom were photographers returning to document the people they had first photographed some 40 years previously. The wider series of events included an exhibition at the Museum of Norwich at the Bridewell and a trail around the Norwich Lanes. The exhibition brought increased footfall to the museum at a typically quiet time of year: “From the 22<sup>nd</sup> October \[…\] until Saturday 28<sup>th</sup> January we had 3,814 people through the door \[…\]. For roughly the same period the year before in 2015/16, we had 3,044 people through the door. So we are looking at an increase of 770 people.’ \(Norfolk Museums Service, 3 February 2017\) \(E7\). 

 At the end of the initial project, the Bridewell Museum continued to support the project, extending the exhibition, reconfiguring its displays of social and cultural history, and contributing to the collation of material for a website\-based ‘virtual exhibition’. The trail around Norwich Lanes took in numerous shops, pubs, cafes, arts spaces and cinema. Most of these had a connection to Norwich’s punk past, with traces of this displayed in shop windows or inside. Surveys following the project confirmed sold\-out events and increased footfall with local businesses and shop\-owners noticing a marked increase in the number of visitors to the lanes and their premises \(E10\). 

 Worley’s grassroots approach to social history has had a profound impact on a traditionally hard to reach community. In particular, he has developed an approach to collaborating with and enabling members of punk subcultures to take ownership of their social history. The research has been deeply transformative for those involved. The approach has enabled other organisations that are seen as part of the ‘establishment’ – such as a museum – to engage with previously hard\-to\-reach groups and demonstrate the possibilities of broadening their understanding of local social history. Worley’s methodology has also been adopted by other cultural groups, such as the Youth Culture Archive, seeking ways to engage with their target audiences and has enabled them to develop their own activities and make plans for a permanent museum.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The sustainability of 151,000 hectares of tropical montane forest in Sheko and two adjoining districts in southwest Ethiopia is under threat impacting environmentally as well as economically on the wellbeing of those who live there. Research by the University of Huddersfield \(UoH\) has developed innovative mapping which has been embedded within a community forest management \(CFM\) process through training for 61 forest management groups \(FMGs\). 176,000 people have begun actively managing the forest and have protected its integrity. CFM has been shown to maintain biodiversity and enhance carbon storage as well as preserving wild coffee in the natural forest. In another district in southwest Ethiopia, Gera, a new satellite method has also been developed and applied to assess the extent of the degradation that has been occurring where farmers have manipulated the natural forest to create “coffee forest”. This loss of biodiversity and regenerative capacity of the tree canopy in coffee forest is now on the agenda of government staff in Gera District and the research community as the country seeks to develop increased value from coffee grown in the forest and to do so sustainably. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Rationale for the research** 

 Historical sources suggest that high forests in Ethiopia once covered ca. 35% of the nation’s land area. Satellite records show that coverage of natural high forests had declined to 6.08% in late 1970s and then to 2.36% in 2000, losing ca. 0.2% per year. Now, the last of Ethiopia’s natural high forests can be found only in remote parts of the southeast or southwest highlands. This has significantly reduced Ethiopia’s ability to maintain its forest area, support its ecosystem services and meet its international commitments to forest carbon storage \[3.1\]. Forest loss also jeopardises the survival of wild coffee that has been preserved for thousands of years in these ancient forests where it evolved and was first domesticated \[3.2\]. The remaining high forests in the southwest, a globally significant biodiversity hotspot, continue to suffer from deforestation and degradation through forest clearing for cereal cropping and timber extraction or through forest modification for coffee production, creating “coffee forest” which threatens the regenerative ability of the forest canopy \[3.3, 3.1\]. 

 **Research Team and Approach** 

 Hwang joined UoH in 2018 and applied his mapping expertise to established work on forest protection which Wood started in 2003. This work has received major grants from the EU, the UK’s Darwin Initiative and others which fund twelve Ethiopian field staff who, along with UoH staff, have developed and applied a highly devolved form of Community Forest Management \(CFM\) \[3.1\]. Meaton joined in 2012 and works on forest product contributions to livelihoods \[3.4, 3.5\]. Snell has supported this since 2015. The research is undertaken in collaboration with an Ethiopian NGO – Ethio\-Wetlands and Natural Resources Association \(EWNRA\), the government of the Southern Regional State and Jimma University. An inter\-disciplinary and participatory action research approach is applied, with co\-development and field testing of innovations \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]. This work has been funded primarily by the EU Delegation to Ethiopia \(£5.8m\) and the UK government’s Darwin Initiative \(£594k\). 

 **CFM and Map\-Supported Agreements for Active Forest Management** 

 UoH’s devolved approach to CFM \[3.1\] shows the importance of community\-based management in forest maintenance \[3.6\]. The approach requires agreements to be signed between the government and community FMGs \[3.1\]. The agreements signed between 2014 and 2020 in Sheko and two adjoining districts include geo\-referenced land use maps created by communities trained to use handheld GPS units and staff using a computer\-based Geographic Information System \(GIS\) \[3.2\]. These form the basis of CFM plans, reviewed annually by government to ensure forest protection, regeneration and sustainable utilisation practices are being followed. In this REF period the CFM involved 61 communities managing a forest area of 151,000 ha with a total population of over 176,000 people in these three districts of the Southern Region of Ethiopia \[3.1, 5.1, 5.2\]. 



 Map of the study area showing Sheko and two adjoining districts \(Gurafarda & Gidi Bench\), and Gera district in southwest Ethiopia. 

 **Natural Forest – Maintaining Biodiversity, Carbon Stocks and Wild Coffee** 

 Communities are trained in the maintenance of the forest and its biodiversity, especially the wild coffee stands in the natural forest. FMGs and communities were empowered to conduct *in\-situ* biodiversity surveys and develop regular monitoring of their forest areas. Independent consultants, specialising in analysis of satellite imagery and undertaking biodiversity and carbon surveys, were engaged to assess the impacts between 2010 and 2015 of these community actions in Sheko District in southwest Ethiopia \[3.1\]. 

 A part of the CFM agreements requires that the communities not only maintain the forest handed over to them, but also protect the stands of wild coffee found within it due to their genetic importance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the CFM in preserving wild coffee, we utilised ground surveys at 30 sites in 2015 and 2019 to assess the retention of wild coffee in selected CFM forest areas. Satellite imagery was used to evaluate the site\-specific forest conditions. The results from this research showed an overall preservation of wild coffee in Sheko District \[3.2\]. 

 **Coffee Forest – Assessing ‘hidden’ Degradation and Active Regeneration Potential** 

 In some parts of the forests in southwest Ethiopia, natural forest has been thinned and coffee bushes planted as a shrub layer, creating “coffee forest”. We utilised satellite imagery and *in\-situ* photography and biodiversity surveys to assess the extent and level of the degradation within this created coffee forest in another district, Gera \[3.3\]. Our research revealed a significant degradation over 32 years from 1987 to 2019 within this coffee forest due to intensive management practices such as undergrowth clearing, canopy tree cutting and coffee planting \[3.3\]. This research shows there is a real danger of complete loss of the regeneration capability of forest in such areas if intensive management is not adjusted \[3.3\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research to address the threats to the forests in parts of southwest Ethiopia has had impacts that can be summarised under three headings: 1. CFM Agreements, Empowered Communities and Active Forest Management; 2. Natural Forest – Maintaining Biodiversity, Carbon Stocks and Wild Coffee; 3. Coffee Forest – Exposing ‘hidden’ Degradation and Raising Concern for Forest Regeneration. 

 **1. CFM Agreements, Empowered Communities and Active Forest Management** 

 Provision of GIS training and map production for farmers and government empowered 61 communities to sign government approved CFM agreements since 2014 \[5.1\] and take responsibility for forest management. Forest Management Groups \(FMGs\) now undertake a range of activities, including patrolling and protecting the forests from clearance, facilitating forest regeneration and sustainably harvesting forest products from the 151,000 ha they manage \[5.1, 5.2\]. One EU observer notes this devolved forest management, as he observed between 2014 and 2016, had led to a shift from ineffective state conservation into *“active management and protection of the natural forest by communities”* \[5.3\]. 

 These FMGs, with government agreements, defend their rights and prosecute illegal settlers infringing their forest \[5.2, 5.4\]. This has led to better government support for the FMGs, and for the CFM approach which is now included in the 2012 Regional and 2018 Federal forest legislation \[5.4\]. Head of the Public Prosecutor Office in Bench Sheko Zone stated *“..community management of the forest is now the normal arrangement in our area…With their agreements on forest management with the government, the FMGs are actively applying their rights, prosecuting illegal settlers in the forest…”* \[5.4\]. 

 Having clear rights to use the forest allows communities to develop their economic activities. These are important for diversifying livelihoods and improving resilience in the face of climatic and politico\-economic uncertainties. Activities include a range of non\-timber forest products, such as forest honey produced using traditional hives, spice collection, and the harvesting of forest fruits and seed, including coffee \[5.1, 3.4, 3.5\]. Such activities contribute more than 60% of the cash income of forest fringe communities and are critical for many households’ survival strategies. Between 2018 and 2020 such income has improved by 25% \[5.5\]. 

 **2. Natural Forest – Maintaining Biodiversity, Carbon Stocks and Wild Coffee** 

 An independent comparative assessment of change in CFM and neighbouring non\-CFM forest showed a positive impact of CFM in the 28,000 ha of forest in one District \(Sheko\) between 2010 and 2015 \[5.6, 3.1\]. The assessment with 82 plots along two transects totalling 25 km, across the forest in Sheko District, showed that the biodiversity and carbon stocks of the CFM forests were maintained during this REF period \[5.6, 3.1\]. This confirms the effectiveness of the CFM in maintaining biodiversity and carbon storage in this district. In the community managed natural forest, biodiversity \(richness, evenness and diversity of woody species\) was maintained \[3.1\]. Forest loss in the CFM areas was reduced to 0.18% per annum, whereas in non\-CFM areas forest loss was at 2.6% \[3.1\]. For the same period carbon stock in the CFM forests increased by 23%, while it declined by 12% in the non\-PFM forest \[5.6\]. This is important for the direct generation of income for rural communities and for the REDD\+ carbon credit programme \(https://redd.unfccc.int/\) being trialled in Ethiopia \[5.5, 5.6\] and to the national Climate Resilient Green Economy policy. The wider contribution to stabilising global climate is of global importance. 

 Research also shows that CFM is effective at maintaining the wild coffee mother trees and saplings thereby conserving the globally important wild coffee gene pool \[3.2\]. The results from this research confirms the effectiveness of the CFM in preserving wild coffee in the natural forest of 8 communities in Sheko District \[3.2, 3.6\]. Communities report that the CFM arrangements motivate them to ensure that the forest maintained the stands of wild coffee. One of the community’s FMGs in Sheko District testifies *“Projects implemented to date include wild coffee conservation and capacity building project, community conservation of wild coffee. Through these projects we have got awareness of forest management...”* \[5.7\]. 

 **3. Coffee Forest – Exposing ‘hidden’ Degradation and Raising Concern for Forest Regeneration** 

 In the non\-CFM coffee forest areas in another district, Gera, also in southwest Ethiopia, UoH research shows that biodiversity has been significantly compromised due to thinning the tree canopy and clearing undergrowth \[3.3\]. It also confirms that intensive management in the coffee forest has led to an over\-mature tree canopy with no replacement sapling trees, significantly affecting forest regeneration for years to come \[3.3\]. This research, disseminated through workshops in 2019, engaged government officials and Ethiopian university researchers to better understand the national importance of the issue given the development policies and plans for expansion of the forest coffee value chain. 

 Awwal Jihad Ahimad, Head, Office of Gera District Environment, Forest and Climate Change office, testifies that *“The workshop was intense and equipped the officials with GIS capability for further demarcation of coffee forest. Understanding the degree of the degradation of coffee forest has led to discussions with farmers on this delicate issue and trying to find ways to ensure the forest can regenerate as well as producing coffee. The impact…is widespread… estimated 75,516 ha of coffee forest in Gera, supporting 10,556 households \(coffee farmers\)”* \[5.8\] *.* 

 Shabu Jemal, a former government official in Gera District, and now a lecturer at Wollega University, has witnessed that, “ *It is now recognised that* *the degradation in coffee forest is very important for the forest regeneration in the region. It has been long questioned whether coffee forest and its degradation can be detected from satellite imagery. The research by UoH has made a very important step to monitor the coffee forest degradation, and certainly helps us develop studies on these coffee forests.*” \[5.9\]. 

 There are wider policy implications arising from this work. Production of coffee in natural forest has often been considered beneficial as it deters communities from converting forest into crop fields. As Dr Abduke stated, “ *Coffee provides Ethiopia with its most important agricultural commodity, contributing around one quarter of its export earning”* \[5.10\], coffee production in “coffee forest” is of critical importance. However, Ethiopia’s global commitments such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\) demands assurance of conservation of forest integrity and regenerative ability \[5.10\]. Our research has created the awareness that *“expanding forest coffee impacts \(on\) long\-term forest regeneration, which in the long term can undermine this type of coffee production”* \[5.10\].

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2013, Dr Nathalia C Tjandra – at the time Lecturer and Early Career Researcher, Associate Professor in Marketing since June 2018 – undertook secondary research to evaluate the ethics of tobacco marketing in Indonesia **\[O1\],** followed by primary qualitative research into public perceptions in 2014 **\[P1\]\[P2\].** There has been little previous research into tobacco marketing practices and ethics in countries with lenient tobacco control, such as Indonesia. 

 Indonesia is one of the biggest producers of tobacco worldwide, the largest market for cigarettes in Southeast Asia and the world’s second largest market after China, selling more than 316 billion cigarettes in 2016. The industry is a significant part of Indonesia’s economy, contributing approximately 10% of Indonesian tax revenue and employing 2.5million manufacturing workers and farmers. Indonesia has the highest number of male smoking prevalence in Southeast Asia. Sixty\-five percent of male adults aged 15 and above and 20% of children aged 13\-15 currently smoke. 20% of children smoked cigarettes before the age of 10 and 89% before the age of 13. The Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance \(2016\) estimate that smoking kills 240,618 Indonesians every year. Despite this, tobacco control policy in Indonesia remains lenient. Indonesia is the only country in Asia that has not signed and ratified the Framework Convention of Tobacco Control \(FCTC\). 

 In 2014, Tjandra was awarded funding by the Carnegie Trust **\[P1\]** and Edinburgh Napier University **\[P2\]** to investigate public perceptions of the ethics of tobacco marketing in Indonesia. The research was conducted in collaboration with Dr Lukman Araoen \(University of East Anglia\) and Professor Yayi Suryo Prabandari \(University of Gadjah Mada, Indonesia\), with Tjandra as Principal Investigator. It took place during 2014\-15 in Indonesia’s Yogyakarta region, an autonomous province with 3.5 million inhabitants. Drawing on a mixed\-method research design, data collection included 30 interviews, 6 focus groups with 41 participants and 491 questionnaires. 

 Results from the qualitative parts of the research **\[O1\]\[O2\]\[O3\]\[O4\]\[O5\]** found that the majority of participants perceived tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship as unethical in adopting attractive themes such as enthusiasm, persistence, bravery, enjoyment, masculinity, success, humour, youth, adventure and family **\[O4\]** which hides the real danger of smoking. They felt this could negatively impact young people who are on the journey of finding their identity **\[O3\]\[O5\],** particularly the tobacco companies’ primary target market, young male consumers. Most participants acknowledged that tobacco companies were significant sources of employment and support for communities through sponsorship and corporate social responsibility activities **\[O2\].** Nevertheless, most participants considered these activities to be unethical, recognising that the tobacco industry’s intention in conducting these activities is primarily to increase their brand awareness and favourability amongst their target market and community **\[O2\]\[O5\].** 

 The first publication from the research was awarded Best Paper in Ethics and Marketing by the Academy of Marketing **\[O2\]** in 2015. A journal article on was published in 2020 **\[O5\]** and a second article is under review by the European Journal of Marketing \(CABS 3\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Edinburgh Napier research into the ethics of tobacco marketing in Indonesia has been used in Sleman Regency, an administrative area within the Yogyakarta region, to **develop new policies and monitoring procedures** for Sleman’s No Smoking Area \(Kawasan Tanpa Rokok – KTR\). 

 <ins> **Routes to impact**</ins> 

 The research findings **\[O1\]\[O2\]\[O3\]\[O4\]\[O5\]** were **disseminated through a stakeholder engagement event** entitled "" *The Ethics of Tobacco Marketing: Implications on Tobacco Control Policy""*, in July 2017 in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia **\[C1\].** Funded by Edinburgh Napier’s public engagement funds \[P3\], the event was organised in collaboration with the University of Gadjah Mada and Tulodo, a Jakarta\-based consultancy specialising in social and behaviour change. **The seminar was attended by 48 key stakeholders** including: government health and education officials, anti\-tobacco activists, public order enforcers, medical doctors, academics and media. **Positive testimonials were received** from the attendees **\[C2\].** 

 The research findings and event were featured in **\[C3\]:** the national weekly news magazine Tempo \(circulation 100,000\); local/national daily newspaper Suara Merdeka \(170,000\); nine local newspapers and online news sites. An opinion article by Tjandra published on The Conversation \[O6\] was republished in the national daily newspaper Jakarta Post \(40,000\) and the online platforms such as Yahoo News and Asian Correspondent. **The media exposure resulted in an invitation by the Alliance of Independent Journalists Jakarta to present a reflection on tobacco marketing control in Indonesia** **\[C3\].** 

 <ins> **No Smoking Area – policy and monitoring**</ins> 

 **Attendees at the public engagement event included staff from the Sleman Public Health Office \(SPHO\).** Sleman Regency is a sub\-division of Yogyakarta Region, with a population of 850,176. SPHO develops and implements the government’s health initiatives in Sleman Regency, including the implementation of No Smoking Areas \(KTRs\). KTRs are rooms or areas where smoking and the production, sale, advertising and/or promotion of tobacco products is prohibited. These were introduced by the national government in 2011 to be implemented by the local government. 

 **SPHO reported that the insights provided by the research was instrumental in the inclusion of a ban on tobacco advertising** and sponsorship in the policy and guidance for implementing KTRs in schools. As stated by Cahya Prihantama \(Promoter of Young People Health Sleman Health Office\) **\[C2\],** 

 “*The information that I received from the seminar, I used to discuss and develop the implementation guidance of No Smoking Area in School initiative on 22 and 23 March 2018. The result is tobacco advertising and sponsorship are agreed as the activities that are banned in the school area. As from the normative ethic perspective, tobacco advertising must not target groups under the age of 17 years old”* 

 The research also **influenced a new mandatory monitoring reporting process** for schools, which commenced in March 2018 **\[C2\]\[C4\].** This includes the ban of tobacco advertising and sponsorship in three of the primary indicators \(indicators 3, 4 and 9\) for monitoring KTRs in education institutions **\[C4\].** Indicator 4, the ban of tobacco sponsorship, was originally not specified in the national and local regulations on KTRs. 

 Based on the ‘Activities Related to No Smoking Area 2018 report’ **\[C5\], 300 primary schools in eight districts of Sleman Regency implemented KTRs** and reported back on progress using the criteria in the monitoring instrument **\[C4\].** 

 The same instrument has been **expanded to cover KTRs in public transport, healthcare services, playgrounds, houses of worship, workplace and public places** **\[C6\].**  In 2019 1,941 out of 2,383 **\(81.5%\) teaching and learning, workplace, healthcare and public area institutions in Sleman Regency had set up KTRs** and gradually adopted the monitoring instruments \[C9\]. In 2020 2,457 out of 2,939 **\(83.5%\) institutions have been declared as KTRs** **\[C10\].** 

 <ins> **Further impact**</ins> 

 The research also helped the SPHO **\[C2\]** to input to **the publication of Regent's Circular Letter on Tobacco Advertising Regulations in April 2019** \[C7\]. This was part of an initiative by the Regent \(equivalent to area governor\) of Sleman **to make Sleman Regency ‘Child Friendly’.** The instruction was addressed to all local government leaders, village heads and school headmasters in Sleman Regency **to make KTRs free from tobacco advertisements within a 500m radius \[C7\]** which **goes beyond** the national regulations on KTRs. 

 SPHO reported **\[C2\]** that, as a result of the insights gained from the Edinburgh Napier research, **they now include awareness around tobacco marketing in their smoking intervention activities** and training around KTRs. These are delivered at education institutions, local government offices, training events, community health centres and other institutions in Sleman Regency in order to raise awareness about the danger of smoking and the impact of tobacco marketing \[C8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UCL research findings about the source, transport and fate of arsenic in sediments exploited for water supply in the Bengal Basin have underpinned the development and implementation of policy by the Bangladesh government and of international donors and non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) in the wider region \( *e.g.* Pakistan, India\). UCL’s explanations of the geochemical and hydraulic processes controlling groundwater arsenic have underpinned the Bangladesh government’s strategies for monitoring and mitigating the crisis and reducing arsenic exposure in the population. This has led to improvements in public health security among approximately 5,000,000 people across southern Bangladesh. UCL’s discovery of the poroelastic character of the Bengal Aquifer System has further informed the expansion of the Bangladesh national infrastructure for monitoring the groundwater resources, and reconsideration of the national groundwater monitoring infrastructure in India.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Arsenic \(As\) exposure – the adverse effects of which include cancers, diseases of the vascular system, and death – presents a serious global threat to public health. Since 1990, extensive arsenic pollution of groundwater has been recognised in Quaternary fluvio\-deltaic sediments exploited for water supply. The problem is especially acute across the densely populated floodplains of Southeast Asia, where shallow groundwater constitutes the only bacteriologically safe source of water for more than 100,000,000 inhabitants. In places, shallow groundwater contains arsenic at concentrations up to 100 times the World Health Organization \(WHO\) guideline limit for drinking water – throughout the region some 70,000,000 people are exposed to excessive arsenic and secure mitigation solutions are far from universally implemented. 

 Research conducted since 2000 by John McArthur and William Burgess in the Department of Earth Sciences at UCL has addressed the distribution, source, transport and fate of arsenic in the Bengal Basin of West Bengal \(India\) and Bangladesh, taken as a type area for Quaternary fluvio\-deltaic aquifers. McArthur and Burgess’ early contribution in 2000 \(with graduate student Nickson and collaborators in Bangladesh\) set out their deduction, from the geochemical context and analysis of water from 46 wells in Bangladesh, that groundwater arsenic derives from reduction of arsenic\-bearing iron oxyhydroxides in the sediments \( **R1**\). This finding demonstrated that arsenic pollution in Bangladesh is a natural phenomenon, overturning the previous consensus that arsenic enters groundwater by oxidation of arsenic\-bearing pyrite in response to water\-table lowering by irrigation pumping. 

 Extensive fieldwork and laboratory analysis of groundwater and sediment cores from West Bengal, conceived by McArthur and executed in conjunction with lead collaborator DM Banerjee \(University of Delhi\) and other collaborators in the UK and India \(as indicated by the author lists in reference \( **R2**\), were conducted between 2000 and 2008. This work exposed buried peat as the main cause of the chemical reaction giving rise to severe arsenic pollution in the groundwater, and led to the development of the team’s “palaeosol” model \( **R2**\) to propose that the current distribution of arsenic in groundwater reflects the distribution of palaeo\-channels and palaeo\-interfluves which developed between 125,000 and 18,000 years ago as sea\-level fell and a late\-Pleistocene landscape developed across the Bengal Basin. The model was potentially applicable to delta regions worldwide which host organic matter in marshland and swamp. Further research using published data from 2387 wells and 176 new analyses of groundwater along a 115km traverse across the southern Bengal Basin, demonstrated the “palaeosol” model to be applicable at scale \( **R3**\). As a result, it became valuable as an aid to understanding regional distribution of As\-pollution, as a guide for groundwater monitoring and future groundwater development and for the avoidance of As\-pollution and siting of arsenic\-safe tubewells \(for example across the Indus River plain and in West Bengal and Bangladesh\). 

 Also between 2000 and 2008, Burgess worked in an equal collaboration with P Ravenscroft 

 \(consultant in Dhaka\) and KM Ahmed \(Dhaka University\) on an interpretation of more than 3,000 groundwater analyses, supplemented by sediment core analysis and permeability measurements. Using data from these studies, they established a hydrogeological synthesis of arsenic occurrence across southern Bangladesh \( **R4**\). Burgess, with graduate students at UCL, then developed conceptual and numerical models to show how groundwater flow controls present\-day arsenic concentration at shallow pumping wells, and to posit future trends. At basin\-scale, Burgess worked with UCL research student Hoque, doctoral researcher Shamsudduha and collaborators in Bangladesh to determine the potential for deep groundwater, which is free of excessive arsenic, to provide a safe alternative water supply. Via their analysis of more than 2,000 borehole records and development of numerical models, Burgess and his collaborators described the major elements of the Bengal Aquifer System to >350m depth, its development over Plio\-Quaternary time and the extent of its vulnerability to contamination by arsenic as a consequence of excessive pumping \( **R5**\). This evaluation underpinned recognition by Burgess and colleagues of the potential for deep groundwater to serve as a secure mitigation option throughout the Bengal Basin. Research findings were presented to Bangladeshi government authorities at workshops co\-convened by the UCL team in Dhaka in 2013 and 2014, and they supported an evaluation by the UCL team, together with international partners, of groundwater depletion/security throughout the wider Indo\-Gangetic Basin using a total of 3,429 in\-situ observations. 

 Between 2013 and 2014, Burgess and collaborators made high frequency \(hourly\) measurements of groundwater pressure over one full hydrological year, in vertically stacked, co\-located wells at six sites across southern Bangladesh, exposing for the first time the magnitude of hydro\-mechanical \(poroelastic\) influences of surface water loads across the Bengal Basin in perturbing, and in places dominating, groundwater levels in monitoring wells \( **R6**\). Previously, groundwater levels have always been interpreted as determined solely by hydraulic processes. Burgess’s recognition of the hydro\-mechanical nature of the Bangladesh aquifer and the common dominance of mechanical processes has led to a re\-evaluation of the groundwater monitoring strategy in Bangladesh.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 UCL’s research into arsenic pollution of groundwater and the hydrodynamics of the Bengal Aquifer System in Bangladesh has had significant impacts on policy, practice and public health security in Bangladesh, 2014\-2020. UCL’s research has guided the development and refinement of national policy on groundwater pumping in response to the groundwater arsenic crisis in Bangladesh and has underpinned practical approaches adopted by the Department for Public Health Engineering \(DPHE\) and the Bangladesh Water Development Board \(BWDB\) towards arsenic mitigation and groundwater monitoring. This has led to **improved public health security and security of access to safe water supplies across the region**. Key UCL research findings have been shared widely with stakeholders beyond academia, partly as a natural outcome of the collaborative nature of the research, to which Bangladesh government departments contributed through provision of access and data. The **reach of the impact was extended by** **Burgess co\-convening successive national conferences and workshops in Bangladesh** \(2013, 2014, 2017 and 2020\). Furthermore, Burgess was interviewed on BBC ‘Science in Action’ \(25/6/2017\), broadcasted via the BBC World Service platform \(weekly viewers 350,000,000\) \( **S1**\). Globally, the research has contributed to the implementation of UNICEF policies relating to investigation and mitigation of arsenic contamination and to water resource security assessments by the World Bank. In India, UCL’s research has **influenced the development of national guidance** for groundwater monitoring under the National Hydrology Project. 

 <ins> **UNICEF policy and directives on arsenic pollution, and implementation of World Bank assessments**</ins> 

 UNICEF has been a leading international provider and facilitator of mitigating actions responding to the arsenic crisis in Southeast Asia. The organisation has adopted UCL’s explanation of the underlying processes and causes of groundwater arsenic in the Bengal Basin as the standard paradigm for understanding arsenic pollution in alluvial aquifers worldwide \( **S2**\). UCL’s research provided fundamental support for UNICEF’s assessment of global health impacts of groundwater arsenic, which **underpins its development of policies and directives** for its country offices. By demonstrating that the existing state of contamination in Bangladesh was both predictable and manageable, UCL’s research notably **facilitated UNICEF’s proposals for rational and effective responses** \( **S2, S3**\), which have continued to be implemented throughout the period 2014\-2020. Significant projects supported by UNICEF and the World Bank since 2014, grounded in those proposals, include **implementation of the Bangladesh Government’s Department of Public Health Engineering \(DPHE\) 15\-year water supply and sanitation ‘Sector Development Plan’** 2011\-2025 \( **S4, S5**\).  UNICEF Bangladesh’s former Water and Environmental Sanitation Specialist stated: “UCL’s arsenic programme \[has\] continued, to a significant degree, to **define the research and policy agenda**” \( **S2**\). Separately, UCL research supported the World Bank's 2019 assessment of water security in Pakistan \( **S6, S7**\), enabling a comprehensive review of groundwater depletion and identifying pollution as the greatest long\-term risk to groundwater sustainability, with UCL’s contribution acknowledged by the World Bank Senior Water Resources Management Specialist for South Asia \( **S8**\). 

 <ins> **Guiding Bangladesh government policy development**</ins> 

 The DPHE Policy Support Unit leads the development of government policy in the water supply and sanitation sector in Bangladesh. The Dhaka workshops “Deep groundwater in Bangladesh: UCL research in support of policy development” \(January 2013\), and “Groundwater monitoring in the Bengal Basin: research strategies and their policy implications” \(November 2014\), co\-convened by Burgess for UCL, with Dhaka University and the DPHE\-PSU, were attended by representatives of the DPHE, the Bangladesh Water Development Board \(BWDB\), the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation, the Geological Survey of Bangladesh, the Water Resources Policy Organisation, and the donor \(including UNICEF and WaterAid\) and NGO communities \( **S9**\). The advisory “Bengal Deep Groundwater Statement 2014, Deep Groundwater in Bangladesh \- a vital source of water” \( **S9**\), co\-authored by the Workshops’ attendees, is acknowledged by the DPHE to have influenced their policy decisions \( **S5**\) towards promoting the use of deep groundwater for water supply. The statement promotes deep groundwater as a long\-term secure water source to mitigate the effects of arsenic and salinity in southern Bangladesh, identifying seven points of consensus around which policy should be framed, and making recommendations for extension of the national groundwater monitoring infrastructure. The DPHE Superintending Engineer confirms that “The outcomes \[of UCL research\] **continue to help shape our policies and practices** towards deep groundwater pumping across the southern Bangladesh” \( **S5**\). 

 <ins> **Informing arsenic mitigation</ins> <ins>programmes**</ins> 

 The DPHE is the Bangladesh government authority with principal responsibility for arsenic mitigation through provision of safe water supplies. UCL research has been used by the Arsenic Management Division of the DPHE to **develop deep groundwater pumping as a mitigation strategy** \( **S5**\). Decisions on the optimum depth of arsenic mitigation wells in the DPHE 2011\-2025 WASH Sector Development Plan \( **S4**\) were underpinned by UCL research on the spatial and depth\-distribution of the arsenic source, and the hydraulic structure of the Bengal aquifer system. The Sector Development Plan describes national strategy for the investment of approximately USD20,000,000,000 in the water, sanitation and health \(WASH\) sector, of which approximately USD1,750,000,000 has been managed by DPHE over the period 2014\-2020 \( **S5**\). The DPHE Superintending Engineer acknowledges “the **very significant impact your department’s \[UCL Earth Sciences\] research has had in the mitigation of the groundwater arsenic crisis** in Bangladesh” \( **S5**\). 

 <ins> **Consensus framework for improving public health security**</ins> 

 Deep groundwater in Bangladesh is free of excessive arsenic. The implementation of deep groundwater pumping strategies by DPHE between 2014 and 2020, through the 2011\-2025 WASH Sector Development Plan \( **S4**\), informed by UCL research \( **S5, S9**\), is estimated to have reduced arsenic exposure – thereby **enhancing health, welfare and quality of life – among a combined total of some 5,000,000 people** across southern Bangladesh \( **S5**\). Public health security has also been protected by the UCL research finding that arsenic pollution in Bangladesh is natural, and not caused by pumping for irrigation \( **R1**\). This finding has helped underpin the maintenance of food\-grain self\-sufficiency in the country since 2000 to the present day \( **S2**\). In 1998, there were demands both within civil society and at ministerial level for a ban on groundwater irrigation, then thought to be the cause of arsenic pollution. UCL research since 2000 catalysed and informed public debate about the issue, supporting counter\-demands that ensured the continuation of groundwater irrigation. The enduring impact of this reversal is affirmed by the former UNICEF’s Bangladesh Water and Environmental Sanitation Specialist, who notes that UCL research “ **created a consensus conceptual framework for understanding the problem** and, in particular, quashing demands for a blanket ban on groundwater irrigation”, and “the overall impact of tubewell irrigation continues to this day to have a **massive net benefit in terms of maintaining food\-grain self\-sufficiency** in Bangladesh and India” \( **S2**\). 

 <ins> **Influence on groundwater monitoring practice**</ins> 

 The BWDB is the Bangladesh government authority with responsibility for monitoring the quality and quantity of the groundwater resources nationally. McArthur’s research findings on the rate of groundwater flux at the arsenic source regions, and Burgess’s research on the rate of migration of arsenic towards pumping wells \( **R4, R5**\), alerted BWDB \( **S10**\) and UNICEF \( **S2**\) to the requirements and timescales for groundwater monitoring. Burgess’s identification of the effects of aquifer poroelasticity \( **R6**\) further **alerted the BWDB to requirements for expansion of the national groundwater monitoring infrastructure**. The research findings also **influenced the BWDB’s approach to groundwater monitoring**, in particular regarding the security of deep groundwater. It also informed their expansion of the national groundwater monitoring network, including 69 new monitoring points since 2019 \[and continuing\] and 905 piezometers selected for automation \( **S10**\). BWDB continues to **appraise the design of its national deep groundwater monitoring programme in light of UCL research**, most recently through consultation at the UCL\-convened workshops “Aquifer poroelasticity in Bangladesh: observations, modelling and implications for groundwater resources monitoring” \(February 2017\), and “Implications of aquifer poroelasticity for groundwater levels: what groundwater managers in Bangladesh need to know” \(January 2020\), both in Dhaka. According to the BWDB Director \[of Ground Water Hydrology\], “Over the past two decades…excellent fundamental research of the \[UCL Earth Sciences\] Department…helped the BWDB develop its approach to groundwater investigation and monitoring. At the 2017 and 2020 Workshops in Dhaka, guiding principles for groundwater monitoring in Bangladesh were proposed and re\-affirmed by the wider community of…water managers in Bangladesh, leading to **installation of clustered \[monitoring\] wells at 69 new locations all over the country…and 905 piezometers…selected for automation**” \( **S10**\). In India, UCL research on poroelasticity has influenced the Central Ground Water Board \(CGWB\) and National Institute of Hydrology \(NIH\), through a Guideline document accepted by the National Hydrology Project in India being supplied to all State groundwater agencies \( **S2**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Morrice’s research has shown that the diverse language and educational needs of refugees and migrants require targeted pedagogical approaches in order to optimise effective integration strategies. Her work has underpinned changes to key government policies and guidelines, including measures of progress against integration objectives across governmental departments \(e.g. employment, health and housing\), and improvements to specific provision for education and language acquisition. The policy changes enable transition into improved practice supported by a training package developed and delivered by the International Organisation for Migration \(IOM\), and helps prevent marginalisation, reduce isolation, and increase educational and employment opportunities for migrants and the 15,000 refugees granted asylum in the UK annually. In addition, in Brighton and Hove, Morrice’s work has inspired a new language and support service which has benefitted over 420 refugees and migrants, 350 of whom have been provided with individual support to develop tailored pathways in education, training, language learning and employment. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The ‘refugee crisis’ of 2015 saw the largest number of refugees in Europe since World War II. In the UK, the crisis led to a fourfold increase in the annual number of resettled refugees between 2015 and 2020. The focus of the UK government has shifted to refugee integration and to strategies for improving social cohesion; defining and establishing measures and good practice for effective integration within hosting communities has become a social, economic and political priority. Morrice drew on her research to identify indicators for measuring integration, and key facilitators of effective integration via two main strands: **education** and **language acquisition**. 

 **Education** 

 In 2004\-06, Morrice and colleagues used questionnaire, interview and focus group data from 51 refugees and 59 stakeholders to identify areas of major inequality and disadvantage throughout the education, training and employment experiences of refugee and migrant communities in the UK \(R1\). Between 2006 and 2010, she conducted a longitudinal study evaluating the life histories of refugees with highly qualified professional backgrounds and the importance of education, particularly Higher Education \(HE\), in enabling them to re\-establish careers and gain employment in the UK commensurate with their qualifications and aspirations. Her research highlighted the lack of policy support for adults and the need for specialist and tailored support to find employment \(R2\) **.** She identified barriers to access and participation, including the lack of recognition of overseas qualifications, the need for universities to be more flexible in assessing entry requirements for courses, and the importance of strategies to ensure equal participation once in HE \(R3\). 

 In 2013\-18, Morrice took the lead on the educational element \(language proficiency and education\) of a multidisciplinary, ESRC\-funded research programme \(Optimising refugee resettlement in the UK: a comparative analysis\) with other University of Sussex colleagues, Collyer \(Geography\), and Brown \(Psychology\). It was the largest longitudinal study of refugee resettlement in the UK, and the first to combine qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate the well\-being and integration of refugees resettled under the Gateway Protection Programme \(in or before 2010\), 4 or more years after their arrival. Through this programme, the education experiences of 86 young refugees \(aged 13–24 years\) who were resettled to the UK between 2006 and 2010 were explored. The research highlighted how lack of English language proficiency and disrupted pre\-migration education meant that refugees were ‘aged out’ of free full\-time education before they could gain key qualifications needed to progress \(R4\). Findings emphasise the need for support to catch up with academic content and earlier entry into school, rather than long periods in separate language provision. 

 **Language** 

 Using data from the ESRC ‘ *Optimising Refugee*….’ Programme \(as above\) collected at 3 different time points in Brighton & Hove, Greater Manchester, Norwich, and Sheffield, Morrice showed that language proficiency was key to effective integration with other British people and society. Uniquely, her research demonstrated a causal relationship between higher levels of language proficiency and a range of integration outcomes: better cultural understanding; better health; greater belief in own abilities \(self\-efficacy\); increased likelihood for employment and access to education; and higher job and educational satisfaction. Importantly, better language skills were shown to lead to more contact with other communities, but contact with other communities alone did not necessarily improve language skills or result in other positive outcomes, including well\-being. Against a backdrop of dramatically reduced Government funding for English for Speakers of Other Languages \(ESOL\) provision, the research clearly underscored the vital importance of high quality language provision to integration and refugee well\-being \(R5\). The data showed that ESOL provision was often insufficient, lacked coordinated strategies at local and national levels, and was not flexible enough to meet the diverse learning needs of resettled refugees. Morrice evidenced that in order for some refugees to become integrated and useful members of society, they needed to engage in informal and social learning opportunities, as well as more formal activities \(R6\). The needs of the most vulnerable migrants – women, those with caring responsibilities, those with disabilities/health issues, those with low or no educational background and the elderly – were not being met by existing provision and pedagogical practices; as a result the disadvantage of language was maintained even 5 years after arrival. At the same time, other refugees required fast track and intensive programmes to facilitate their earlier entry into the labour market.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Morrice’s work has been cited in media articles, parliamentary discussion and support for parliamentary process, including providing evidence for key debates \(impact 1 below\). Results of the ESRC grant were summarised and published in a full\-page article in  [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/16/language-barrier-refugees-english-classes-integration-esol) national newspaper in November 2016 \(average issue readership: 1,027,000\), helping to promote national understanding of the plight of refugees \(particularly women\). It highlighted the impact of disruption to core education due to the turmoil in their home country, and sought to dispel the myth that refugees will learn English language simply through contact with British people. 

 Her expertise in the field was recognised by Government and in 2017 resulted in an invitation to form part of a working group with the Home Office to create an evidence\-based approach to effective integration, identifying indicators and measures of successful integration in language and education, and more broadly across multiple domains. At a national level her research has resulted in change to Government policy and guidelines \(impacts 2a, 2b and 2c below\), and the development of a new good practice document on refugee integration \(2b below\). At a local level her work has already resulted in new funding to support the development of a local ESOL strategy, new pathways and tailored support for ESOL learners \(impact 3 below\). 

 <ins>1.</ins> <ins>Contributing to public and political debate</ins> 

 Morrice’s influence within Parliament has helped inform and change policy discourse in relation to the rights of marginalised groups. Her research on language learning has been referred to and quoted in two Parliamentary debates on ESOL. Dame Caroline Spelman MP referred to Morrice’s research on 24 October 2017 to highlight the groups most likely to struggle to learn English and called for ‘dedicated and targeted action’ to avoid the risk of isolation \(S1a\) **.** Preet Kaur Gill MP referenced the research in a Parliamentary debate on ESOL chaired by Nadine Dorries on Monday 3 July 2019. She referred to the lack of language support highlighted in Morrice’s research as leading to a ‘tragic waste of refugees’ unfulfilled potential’, and called for new ESOL funding \(S1b\). 

 <ins>2.</ins> <ins>Changes to Government policy and guidelines</ins> 

 New government documents and substantial changes to governmental policy documents resulted from Morrice’s research: 

 *a\) Home Office Indicators of Integration Framework* 

 Morrice was engaged as an academic advisor to the Home Office review of its  [Indicators of Integration](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/home-office-indicators-of-integration-framework-2019) \(IoI\) framework between 2017 and 2019, and co\-authored the revised IoI framework \(2019\) \(S2\) **.** The framework is ‘… used by the Home Office, MHCLG, other Government departments and local government to shape integration policy, practice and measurement across the UK’ \(S3\). Her research is described as ‘pivotal in its review and redesign’ and as having ‘led directly to the inclusion of new material’ in the domains of Education, and Language and Communication \(S3\). 

 Morrice’s research on language as a key driver of integration led to language and communication being recognised as a distinct domain \(it was previously combined with culture\) in the 14 domains of the expanded IoI framework that enables policy makers to identify the different facets of integration. This has necessitated a suite of new and more comprehensive indicators, highlighting the importance of ESOL provision at a national level. Morrice’s research is described as leading the Home Office ‘to recognise language and communication as a distinct domain with a suite of new indicators. The new indicators we have adopted will ensure that the diverse language needs of the population, including the most vulnerable, are recognised and measured’ \(S3\). 

 Her contributions to the Education domain resulted in substantial changes. This included indicators and measurements for the education of adults and young people \(a group absent in the previous framework\). As a result of Morrice’s research ‘we \[Home Office\] have included indicators for young people and adults achieving access to tertiary and higher education in the new framework which will ensure the participation of this group is now measured and strategies put in place to facilitate progression’ \(S3\). 

 In addition to individual outcome measures, the framework includes guidelines for local and national good practice based on evidence\-based approaches known to underpin effective integration. These good practice indicators are designed to support local and national policy makers to plan, implement and evaluate strategies for effective integration. The new local and good practice indicators for language and communication stress the importance of strategies which meet the diverse needs of ESOL learners, including non\-formal learning opportunities; the new good practice indicators for education identify strategies which facilitate and measure progression of \(previously neglected\) youth and adults \(S3\). The indicators are accompanied by an online ‘tool kit’ which provides policy makers and practitioners with a cohesive approach to monitoring integration services and evaluate progress. 

 It is expected that the indicators ‘will be used across Government departments \(Home Office, DWP, MHLG, Public Health England\) to measure integration and inform policy and practice. The previous indicators were used widely over 15 years and we \[Home Office\] anticipate that the new material will be adopted as extensively’ \(S3\). Referring to the imminent adoption of the new framework, the Rt Hon Caroline Nokes, MP Minister of State for Immigration, described how the framework ‘will be a key resource for integration practitioners at all levels, offering a common language for understanding, planning, monitoring and measuring integration, and supporting better and more tailored integration services’ \(S2\). 

 As a result of the new IoI, the International Organisation for Migration \(IOM\), in partnership with the Home Office, has developed a training package for Local Authorities, non\-governmental organisations and other professionals on how to use the new framework to develop, support and evaluate integration strategies. Training was piloted with 72 stakeholders from 43 Local Authority and Regional Strategic Migration Partnership areas \(London, Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff and Belfast\) between October and November 2019. Evaluations \(S4\) asked participants to assess their understanding in relation to four questions: knowledge of IoI framework, the toolkit, good practice in integration design strategies, and good practice in measurement and evaluation of integration. Progress evaluations indicate that 60% of participants assessed their knowledge to have progressed by 4 to 8 steps \(out of a total of 8 steps\). Qualitative evaluations evidenced how participants’ thinking has changed as a result of the training. Participants will now disseminate and use the revised indicators to improve integration planning and evaluation. When asked if / how they plan to use the IOI Framework as a result of the training, participants’ responses included: ‘very useful for some of the interventions we are planning. E.g. ESOL provision, mental health support and employment’; ‘Yes, plan to discuss with my line manager about how we can incorporate into Vulnerable Persons Resettlement planning and delivery, but also wider integration goals of the council’ \(London\); ‘use it as part of designing a regional strategy’ \(Manchester\); ‘Have started to use this to identify gaps in support’; ‘Review terms of reference of our strategic resettlement group, also contract terms of refugee support services’ \(Cardiff\); ‘I will be using this when looking at the evaluation of the VPRS in Northern Ireland \(last 5 years\)’; ‘will arrange for it to be disseminated through the Department’ \(Belfast\) \(S4\). In addition, webinars were delivered to 25 participants from 17 civil society and community\-based organisations. 

 *b\) Integrating Refugees: What works? What can work? What does not work? A Summary of the evidence.* 

 Professionals and practitioners at the consultation events requested more guidance on the most effective strategies for supporting integration. As a result, the Home Office commissioned Morrice to co\-author a new  [Home Office good practice guide](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/812891/intergrating-refugees-2019.pdf) which draws from her research \(R1 – R6\) to summarise the most up to date and robust evidence on refugee integration. 

 *c\) Office for Students \(OFS\) 2020\-21 Access and participation plan guidance* 

 Morrice’s research also influenced the Office for Students \( *OFS\) 2020\-21 Access and participation plan guidance* \(S5b\) *,* which includes a new section on effective practice advice for refugee students; their website also includes a direct link to Morrice’s research, in its guidance for effective practice relating to refugees \(S5a\). Her research has *‘*…helped to inform our \[OFS\] understanding of the barriers to successful participation in higher education for this group’ and ‘… contributed to our current A\-Z of Effective practice’ \(S5c\). This guidance and its resources are used by UK universities to inform their widening participation plans. 

 <ins>3.</ins> <ins>Impact on local practice: Language provision and tailored support</ins> 

 The findings of R1 were incorporated into an International Migrant Needs Assessment Report conducted by Brighton and Hove City Council \(BHCC\) \(S6\). A successful application to the Government Controlling Migration Fund for £188k \(S7\) was supported by a policy brief summarising the ESRC grant outcomes, enabling the City to establish an ESOL Hub. The Hub provides an integrated ‘one stop’ advice service for migrants with referrals for ESOL provision and other support services across the city. Crucially, the service recognises the diverse needs of refugees and provides longer term support with individual pathway planning. 17 months into the funding \(September 2020\) the Hub has benefitted over 420 ESOL speakers; 350 beneficiaries were provided with information and signposted to relevant services, and a further 70 received bespoke pathway planning and goal setting. This included support to improve English outside of formal ESOL classes, the development of tailored education and training pathways, employability training, reducing social isolation, and access to other services \(S8\). A letter from the Community Safety Manager and lead on refugees and migration issues at BHCC confirmed that the hub ‘better meets the needs of the almost 2,500 residents who in the 2011 census “could not speak English well or at all”’ and confirmed that Morrice’s research played a role in developing a ‘City\-wide ESOL strategy *’* \(S9\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Connected Autonomous Vehicles \(CAVs\) can function without a driver and can communicate wirelessly with the surrounding infrastructure, and each other, to optimise passenger comfort, energy consumption and road network efficiency. Research at the University of the West of England has informed: 

-  the approach to CAVs in the legal and insurance sectors; 

-  development of safety standards; 

-  industrial technology development; 

-  local government public engagement around CAV technology. 

 UWE research into CAV technology, safety requirements and transport engineering issues, has increased the readiness of key stakeholders to deal with upcoming opportunities and challenges. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **CAV technology** Starting in 2015 \( **G1**\), an industry\-academic consortium was amongst the first in the UK to implement fully integrated CAVs, operating in dense urban settings. UWE led technology integration into a converted Land\-Rover car and a dual\-seater Renault Twizy electric car. The UWE research demonstrated CAV technology operating safely in complex urban roadway scenarios, such as waiting for an oncoming cyclist to pass before overtaking a parked car. The research included: 

-  A multimodal camera/radar/lidar sensing and perception subsystem; 

-  A low\-level vehicle controller using these perceptions to successfully modify local behaviour; 

-  A high\-level Decision\-Making System \(DMS\) utilising a robust novel behaviour tree approach; 

-  Wireless communications, e.g. the perception system above was mounted on a stationary bus, capable of passing traffic information to other vehicles in the area; 

-  An immersive ‘hardware and human in the loop’ simulation suite. 

 Academic publication of the technology details of this work was initially restricted by commercially sensitive IP ownership of critical parts, but it is now summarised in \( **R1**\). 

 **Societal focus on use of CAV technology**From 2016 \( **G2**\), UWE CAV research had an additional focus on low\-speed, SAE level\-5 fully autonomous ‘pods’. UWE led the FLOURISH project research on defining and implementing technology requirements for a pod’s Human\-Machine Interface \(HMI\). This work predominantly focused on the requirements of older adults. The results suggested that participants prefer adaptive HMIs, with journey planner capabilities. There was also a strong preference for additional information and entertainment functions \( **R2**\). 

 In projects **G1**, **G2**, **G3** and **G4**, UWE led investigations into transport engineering, user\-acceptance, and emerging legal and insurance issues. These projects looked at the interactions of a variety of CAVs with other types of road users, including buses, cyclists and pedestrians. Published outputs from these projects included a detailed study of vehicle control handover, which found that people often relax into ‘passenger’ mode quite quickly \- posing significant issues for re\-assuming control of the vehicle \( **R3**\). A study of Local Shared Automated Vehicle Services \(LSAVS\) found that social considerations such as equity in access to mobility services, social inclusion, environmental protection, and concerns about control over interpersonal interactions were strong acceptance factors. Broad socio\-political aspirations beyond transport policy were also found to be important. The study concluded that high levels of social acceptance would be required before introduction of LSAVS would be feasible \( **R4**\). 

 **Methodologies for ensuring CAV safety** Starting in 2015 \( **G1**\), UWE researchers led the creation of operational safety\-cases for CAVs operating, initially, in UWE’s on\-campus roadways. Later, UWE were a major contributor to safety\-cases for CAVs operating in public areas \( **G2**, **G3**, **G5**, **G6**\). 

 Since 2013 \( **G7**\), researchers had been conducting research into ensuring the safety of close\-proximity physical interactions between robots and humans in the context of the care of elderly or infirm adults. One of the main aims of this research was to adapt and transfer established Verification and Validation methods used in the silicon industries to the vastly more complex setting of human\-robot interaction. The outcome was a hierarchical computer architecture that could verify and validate the correctness, safety and acceptability of the robot’s behaviour by efficient use of simulation. UWE researchers were able to achieve acceptable coverage of the state\-space, whilst reducing the need for expensive and safety\-critical real\-world experiments, which could then be used in a more targeted way \( **R5**\). 

 It was clear that this line of research could be useful in the CAV sector, because an unfeasibly large real\-world distance would have to be covered before one could confidently state that close to all significant risks had been experienced by the vehicle. Because of this research, investigating the role of simulation in ensuring CAV safety, and developing tools to achieve it, became the main role of the UWE researchers in more recent CAV projects \( **G3**, **G5**, **G6**\). UWE researchers have recently embedded a Multi\-Agent System into the simulation architecture, allowing agents to act together antagonistically so as to create interaction scenarios that maximise stress on the vehicle controller under test. This has doubled the simulation system’s ability to generate effective tests compared to pseudo\-random generation, while being time\-efficient and robust \( **R6**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Informing the legal and insurance sectors**

UWE researchers collaborated with Burges\-Salmon, a large independent UK Law firm, and with AXA UK, a major motor insurer, on three CAV projects \( **G1**, **G2**, **G3**\). UWE research contributed knowledge on the developing strengths and weaknesses of the technology itself, as well as many human\-factor aspects. The latter included risks pertaining to handover of control between autonomous system and human, and issues relating to the individual and societal acceptability of the technology in use. A partner at Burges\-Salmon noted that UWE research provided the ‘ *evidence base produced and cited by Burges\-Salmon in our engagement with stakeholders shaping the future regulatory framework for CAVs in the UK and beyond*’ \( **S1**\). In particular, UWE research also informed Burges\-Salmon’s formal responses to the joint Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission preliminary consultation paper on automated vehicles \(08.11.2018\) \( **S2**\), and follow\-up consultation on autonomous passenger services and public transport. These consultations, in turn, informed the work of the Law Commission in developing recommendations on reforming UK law for the introduction of CAVs \( **S1**\). 

 AXA UK’s Managing Director of Underwriting and Technical Services commented that UWE research on CAVs informed five official ‘ *AXA statements on related vehicle insurance issues*’ in 2017 and 2018 \( **S3**, **S4**\) \- AXA collaborated with UWE on four separate projects \( **G1**, **G2**, **G3**, **G5**\). The company also acknowledged the contribution of UWE research to the sharing of knowledge through an AXA\-funded film on Autonomous Vehicles \(Sky, 2018\) and an article on CAV technology in a leading newspaper \( *Times,* 2018\), both aimed at increasing the acceptability of this technology for the general public. AXA noted that through these activities ‘ *UWE research has assisted in our company’s marketing efforts on the future of driving*’ \( **S3**\). 

 **Informing safety standards**The British Standards Institute \(BSI\) has developed a number of standards associated with the introduction of CAVs. Standards are a crucial step towards the governance of this emerging technology and ensuring the safe trial, testing and deployment of CAVs on UK roads. The Head of Innovation Policy at BSI has acknowledged the use of UWE research ‘ *to inform development of several CAV standards*’, including Publicly Available Specification \(PAS\) 1880 \(CAV control systems\), PAS1881 \(Assuring safety for automated vehicle trials and testing\) and PAS1883 \(Operational Design Domain taxonomy for an automated driving system\) \( **S5**\). BSI also referred to the contribution of UWE research in prioritising new areas for standardisation \( **S5**\). In addition, Burges\-Salmon commented on the continued application of UWE research to their involvement in the CAV standards programme at BSI ‘ *where standards ranging from safety to trialling to data are being developed that will be used not just in the UK but globall*y’ \( **S1**\). 

 **Enabling South Gloucestershire Council to promote autonomous vehicles** South Gloucestershire Council collaborated with UWE on **G1**, **G2**, **G3** and **G5**. Their involvement with many of the experiments conducted by UWE researchers as part of these projects, has enabled South Gloucestershire Council to engage local people with CAV technology through a series of demonstrations at sites in the local area including: 

-  UWE Frenchay Campus in 2017 as part of the VENTURER project \( **G1, S6**\), and on a roadway near to the campus in 2018; 

-  The ex\-Filton Airport development site in 2019 and Cribbs Causeway shopping centre in 2020 as part of the CAPRI project \( **G3**, **S6**\); 

-  Autonomous parcel delivery on a 10\-mile route on mixed\-mode roadway in South Gloucestershire as part of the ROBOPILOT project \( **G5**, **S6**\). 

 In 2020, two CAV simulator ‘kiosks’ were created for public dissemination of the technology in the region as part of the ROBOPILOT project \( **G5**\); one for use by South Gloucestershire Council and one by UWE. The Council’s Strategic Economic Development Manager commented: ‘ *UWE research has helped South Gloucestershire Council get communities in this region thinking about the benefits of autonomous vehicles*’ \( **S6**\). 

 **Informing the development of CAV technology by industry**UWE researchers collaborated with two businesses in particular on the development of CAV applications.  Atkins Global is a large design and engineering consultancy with a worldwide presence across a broad range of sectors, including transport, infrastructure and energy. Atkins were overall project lead for the two first CAV projects \( **G1** and **G2**\). UWE researchers collaborated closely with Atkins during these projects, and UWE research played a critical role in developing Atkins’ policy on CAV technology \( **S7**\). Atkins’ Technical Director acknowledged the role of UWE research in ‘ *shaping advanced applications of CAV technology*’, which has become ‘ *a major area of growth*’ for the company \( **S7**\). 

 Fusion Processing is a British company that develops advanced sensors and control systems for the transport sector and smart cities. The company collaborated with UWE researchers on the VENTURER \( **G1**\) and CAV Forth \( **G6**\) projects. UWE’s technology integration research as part of the VENTURER project, enabled the development and testing of Fusion Processing’s sensor\-perception pipeline and vehicle control technology, which led to their development of their CAVStar vehicle control product \( **S8**\). UWE’s subsequent simulation\-based Verification and Validation research is now a critical, integrated part of the process of ensuring the safety of CAVStar in the CAV Forth project. In this project, an autonomous bus will be operated as a commercial service across a 24\-mile route in the Edinburgh region in 2021 \( **S9**\).

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Over 1,000,000,000 people worldwide are affected by serious fungal disease, resulting in over 1,500,000 deaths annually. University of Manchester \(UoM\) research led an evidence\-based global advocacy programme to address lack of diagnostics and generic antifungals as well as inadequate clinical skills. Denning set up the Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections \(GAFFI\) in 2013 to mitigate the global impact of fungal diseases. Five antifungal drugs and eight key diagnostics are now flagged by the World Health Organization \(WHO\) as ‘Essential’, and GAFFI has produced estimates of fungal diseases for 65 countries. National clinical training programmes in Guatemala and Nigeria for HIV patients with life\-threatening fungal infections resulted in improved clinical skills and saved lives. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Our research programme documented the burden of multiple serious fungal diseases and gaps in data and knowledge, as well as a dearth in diagnostics and limited antifungal drug access. Application of UoM\-led research in Nigeria and Guatemala has shown how improvements in health systems can transform outcomes. 

###  a. Epidemiology of serious fungal diseases 

 The first global estimate of any fungal disease incidence was published in 2009 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since then, Denning and his international collaborators have reported modelled incidence and prevalence estimates of fungal diseases in >70 published papers. These include global estimates of prevalent cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis <ins>\(</ins>CPA\) after tuberculosis \(TB\) \[1\], complicating sarcoidosis \(72,000\), allergic aspergillosis in asthma \(\~4,700,000\), and cystic fibrosis \(6,675\). Also, recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis \(135,000,000\), tinea capitis \(scalp and hair infection\) \(>200,000,000\) \[2\], annual incident cases of invasive aspergillosis complicating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \(1,000,000 \- 2,700,000\), cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS \(223,000\) \[3\] and sight\-threatening fungal keratitis \(1,050,000\-1,500,000\). GAFFI has published over 65 country\-specific incidence and prevalence estimates for serious fungal diseases. Cryptococcal meningitis deaths were estimated at 181,100, 15% of all AIDS deaths \[3\]. Modelling of the beneficial impact of timely diagnosis and treatment of lethal infections in AIDS \[4\] showed that many deaths were avoidable: >60,000 deaths had only 60% cryptococcal antigen testing and treatment with Amphotericin B and Flucytosine. All of these estimates have substantially increased fungal disease awareness, supporting health systems planning. 

###  b. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis \(CPA\) misdiagnosed as tuberculosis \(TB\) 

 The airborne fungus *Aspergillus* is the most common mould\-affecting human lungs, causing invasive life\-threatening infection, CPA and ‘fungal asthma’. We estimated 1,170,000 prevalent cases of CPA after TB globally \[1\]. Prospective cohort and cross\-sectional studies were launched in Nigeria, Uganda, Brazil and Indonesia. In Nigeria, 19% of people with unconfirmed TB \(\~45% of the total\) without HIV infection had CPA, not TB. In Indonesia, 10 \(8%\) of 128 patients had CPA at the end of TB therapy. The 5\-year mortality of CPA is 82.5%, if left untreated. We co\-ordinated the first multicentre trial of a commercial Pneumocystis PCR test \(common cause of pneumonia in AIDS\), drove development of new *Aspergillus* antibody tests, and, with GAFFI, pioneered a novel health systems approach to rapid diagnostics provision for HIV\-infected patients via a Diagnostic Laboratory Hub in Guatemala \[5\]. 

###  c. Enhanced access to antifungal therapy 

 Most current antifungal drugs are generic and were launched decades ago. Lack of antifungal availability is a critical gap, leading to serious illness and death. We undertook the first global analysis of antifungal drug availability \[6\]. Amphotericin B \(licensed 1959\) is not available in 42 of 155 \(43.1%\) countries; Flucytosine \(licensed 1973\), required for cyptococccal meningitis in AIDS, is unavailable in 94 of 120 \(78.3%\) countries \(and was not available in a single African nation\). Itraconazole \(licensed 1991\) is essential for histoplasmosis and aspergillosis, but its daily price varied from <USD1 to USD102, and in Nigeria and South Africa it is three\-to\-four times more costly than in the UK.

#  4. Details of the impact 

###  Context 

 Pre\-2013, public health mycology was a non\-existent discipline, until dissemination of our research transformed this landscape at the WHO and in the international academic arena. The scale of the problem is huge: nearly 50% of all AIDS deaths are attributable to fungi \[2,3,4\] and the leading infectious cause of death in leukaemia is aspergillosis. However, funding for fungal disease research represents only 2% of all infection and immunity funding, and the antifungal drugs market spend is also disproportionately low. 

###  Pathways to Impact 

 For 20 years UoM investigators have led research on and clinical care for aspergillosis. We set up the world’s first national service for any infectious disease in 2009 \(National Aspergillosis Centre, NAC\) in Manchester, providing a global beacon for chronic and allergic pulmonary aspergillosis. Our modelling \[1\] led to the first comprehensive attempt to estimate the country\-specific burden of most serious fungal diseases. In 2013, Denning founded an international foundation \- GAFFI \- primarily as an evidence\-based global advocacy voice for fungal diseases. Multiple UoM\-led epidemiological studies have estimated CPA burden and impact. Our research and GAFFI efforts have improved global awareness of the lack of diagnostics and generic antifungal agents \[6\] and UoM has led global engagement to address these missing elements in healthcare systems. 

###  Reach and Significance of the Impact 

###  a. Combatting aspergillosis: 

 In the UK, from August 2013 to March 2020, >2,500 patients were referred to NAC, >800 were diagnosed with CPA and >9,900 outpatient follow\-up appointments were attended \[A\]. Our modelling evidence has provided the impetus, clinical need arguments and commercial opportunities for the world’s first prospective clinical antifungal developments in CPA \(liposomal caspofungin \(Fujifilm\)\) and allergic aspergillosis \(inhaled azoles \(Pulmatrix, Pulmocide, TFF Pharmaceuticals and Zambon\)\), recently acknowledged at a US Food and Drug Administration public workshop \[B\]. Pulmatrix stated “ *the progress of our efforts to treat pulmonary fungal infections continue to be substantially aided by the world\-renowned expertise… available at the University of Manchester*” \[Ci\] and confirmed they have “ *raised over $60 million* \[USD60,000,000\] *through partnership and financing efforts to support R&D efforts…These efforts have been heavily influenced by the work of Dr Denning and his colleagues at the University of Manchester*” \[Ci\]. UK company Pulmocide stated UoM’s research “ *has enabled Pulmocide to focus on indications of highest unmet clinical need”* and had resulted in “ *increasing awareness by public health and regulatory authorities as to the importance of new therapies”* \[Cii\] *.* Our extensive experience in diagnosis and therapy has also been incorporated into European \[Di\], United States \[Dii\] and low and middle income country \[Diii\] guidelines for diagnosis and management of CPA. 

###  b. WHO adoption of fungal diseases, antifungal drugs and diagnostics: 

 Multiple proactive public health interventions have been adopted by WHO after dialogue with and applications from GAFFI based on UoM research, including: 

-  Adoption of 5 antifungal drugs on the WHO’s Essential Medicines List \(EML\) \(Amphotericin B and Flucytosine in 2013; Itraconazole, Voriconazole and Topical Natamycin in 2017 \[Ei\]; Echinocandins application submitted for 2021\). For context, from 1977 the WHO EML includes 460 medicines and is adopted by >140 countries. 

-  Several diagnostics were included on the WHO’s first List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics, including microscopy, fungal culture, blood culture, histopathology and cryptococcal antigen and in 2019, *Histoplasma* antigen \[Eii\]. *Aspergillus* antigen and antibody, and *Pneumocystis* PCR have been accepted for the 2021 list as a direct consequence of UoM\-led research. 

-  WHO adoption in 2017 of chromoblastomycosis and other deep mycoses as Neglected Tropical Diseases \(NTDs\), under the broad label of ‘Skin NTDs’ \[F\]. 

-  Ensuring resistance surveillance in *Candida* spp. was incorporated into the WHO global antimicrobial resistance surveillance \(GLASS\) programme in 2018, the first time that fungi have been included as part of any global antimicrobial resistance surveillance \[G\]. 

###  c. Global health systems improvements: 

 In Guatemala, a national diagnostic and clinical training programme for opportunistic infections in AIDS was initiated during 2015 \[6\]. Developed by UoM, in collaboration with GAFFI, diagnostics and training were provided by Asociacion de Salud Integral \(ASI\). Guatemala has the worst record in Latin America of late stage, first presentations of HIV infection \(over 45%\). The programme has rapidly tested >2,500 patients annually \(with 18% life\-threatening infection risk\), allowing immediate administration of correct antifungal, anti\-TB, and/or anti\-HIV therapy. Greatly improved clinical management led to a fall in histoplasmosis 6\-month mortality risk to 29% \(previously >55%\). The overall programme mortality fell by 8% from 2017 to 2018. 

 The Chairman of the Board of El Mecanismo de Coordinación de Guatemala heralded “ *… the importance and success of this program, which has shown … how to avoid unnecessary deaths from advanced HIV…*” \[Hi\] \(translated\). The President of Infectious Diseases Society of Guatemala stated, “ *The University of Manchester and GAFFI deserve a great deal of credit for designing and implementing a world first program of this scale*” \[Hii\]. The UNAIDS Country Director, Guatemala, stated, “ *We congratulate GAFFI, the University of Manchester and ASI on this achievement... Undoubtedly, initiatives like this provide the framework for countries to institutionalize integrated approaches to meet the global goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030”* \[Hiii\]. Our work in Guatemala demonstrated how to achieve better clinical outcomes. As a result of this and GAFFI’s advocacy, the Pan American Health Organization published the first international guidelines for disseminated histoplasmosis in AIDS \[I\], a mycology reference laboratory is being set up in Paraguay, and replication of the Guatemalan programme is planned in other countries, including Panama and Costa Rica. 

 We have also initiated implementation in Africa. In Nigeria, we supported the launch of a UoM\-developed training programme in diagnosis and treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS for >700 healthcare professionals across 13 sites. This programme led to significantly improved understanding of screening, diagnosis and best management practices \[J\], thereby providing a platform for implementing further capacity building interventions in HIV care.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research led by Davey, Newport and Deribe at the Centre for Global Health Research \(CGHR\), Sussex, has provided important evidence – including detailed podoconiosis \(podo\) mapping – which has informed the Ethiopian and Rwandan Governments’ agendas on podo control, prevention and treatment. In partnership with the Ethiopian government and national NGOs, the Sussex team contributed to the implementation of podo care management initiatives in the most endemic areas, which resulted in the treatment of 70,000 podo patients \(approximately 5% of the national total\) and the training of over 500 health workers to identify and treat podo cases. The CGHR team has also led the first trial of a simple, inexpensive foot care package in reducing podo\-related acute inflammatory episodes in Ethiopia. This care package is now included in the WHO Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases \(NTDs\) training package for health workers, in the Rwanda NTD Master Plan 2019\-2024 and in the Ethiopia NTD Master Plan 2020\-2025. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Podoconiosis \(hereafter referred to as podo\) is a non\-infectious disease arising in barefoot individuals who are in long\-term contact with irritant red clay soil of volcanic origin. Major symptoms include swelling of the lower limb \(lymphoedema\) and acute painful attacks. The disease has major social and economic consequences through stigma and loss of productivity. Globally, there are around four million people with podo, mainly in tropical Africa, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia. As recently as 2010, the condition was not mentioned in the health policy of any of the 32 endemic countries, so no patient was able to receive treatment. Since 2005, staff from the Centre for Global Health Research \(CGHR\) at Sussex have been conducting wide\-ranging research to address some of the most urgent knowledge gaps, particularly around disease distribution, mental health consequences and management. This case study focuses on the research most immediately relevant to national and global elimination of podo. The research described is unique and distinctive; the team has contributed more than 95% of the articles on podo published in the past decade. 

 CGHR acts as the research hub for a unique global NGO advocacy for podo, Foot *work* \( [https://podo.org](https://podo.org/)\) for which Davey is the Executive Director. All the research referenced in Section 3 was supported by grants awarded to the Sussex team at the CGHR and delivered in partnership with academics and non\-academic collaborators based in the UK and overseas \(mainly Ethiopia and Rwanda\). Amongst the research stakeholders were representatives from the targeted countries’ Health Ministries, as well as NGOs active in the delivery of podo prevention and care programmes. 

###  **Understanding the distribution of podo** 

 Reliable and detailed data on the prevalence and distribution of podo globally are scarce. In many endemic countries, podo is confused with Lymphatic Filariasis \(LF\), another condition manifested by leg swelling but with a different cause \(parasites transmitted by mosquitos\). Estimating the number of people with podo according to geographical location is important for programme planners and health care providers, who plan, monitor and evaluate control and elimination efforts. This need was addressed by CGHR research through the production of a comprehensive mapping of podo distribution and prevalence \[ **R1; G1, G3**\]. Between June and September 2013, the team, in collaboration with the Ethiopia Federal Ministry of Health, generated the first nationwide integrated mapping of podo and LF in Ethiopia. By combining nationwide survey data with spatially referenced information on a range of environmental factors, the CGHR team identified human and environmental risk factors for podo and the endemic districts requiring prioritised intervention. In 2017, the research team used a geostatistical modelling approach on the nationwide mapping data \[ **R1; G1, G3**\] to estimate the number of podo cases \[ **R2; G1, G2**\]. The analysis gave an estimate of 1,537,963 podo cases in Ethiopia in 2015, with 99% of the cases being in remote parts of the three largest Regional States. This analysis also provided a framework for modelling the distribution of podo in other endemic countries, such as Rwanda. Nationwide mapping in Rwanda was conducted in 2017 supported by the Wellcome Trust\-funded ‘Global Atlas of Podoconiosis’ \[ **R3; G2**\]. In partnership with the Rwanda Biomedical Center \(the research arm of the Rwanda Ministry of Health\), Deribe and Davey demonstrated that podo was widespread in Rwanda with 80% of people with swelling of the lower limbs considered to be podo cases. 

###  **What are the mental health consequences of podoconiosis?** 

 In 2007, Deribe and Davey, in collaboration with Addis Ababa University, conducted a survey of knowledge, attitudes and practices in a community highly endemic for podo \[ **R4; G4**\]. It revealed that most community members, including health professionals \(HPs\), held negative, stigmatising attitudes towards social interactions with people affected by podo. This finding advocated for HPs’ training and the inclusion of educational components in community interventions for podo, aimed at dispelling misconceptions and stigma. In 2014, the team investigated depression prevalence in people suffering from podo, and the link between depression, disability and podo \[ **R5; G3**\]. This study demonstrated for the first time that podo sufferers were more likely to have depression, and that both depression and podo were independently associated with higher disability levels. 

###  **How should podo be treated in low\-resource settings?** 

 From 2014\-2017, Davey and Newport led a community\-based Randomised Controlled Trial \(RCT\) in northern Ethiopia, of a simple leg swelling \(lymphoedema\) treatment package funded by the Joint Global Health Trials Initiative \(MRC/WT/DFID\). The GoLBeT trial was the first trial to assess the effects of a lymphoedema management package on the most important clinical consequence of podo – lymphoedema acute attack. These attacks have devastating consequences in terms of pain, reduced productivity and potential progression to sepsis. The trial recruited 696 people with podo and showed that the package of foot hygiene, skin care, exercise, elevation, and use of socks and shoes reduced the incidence and duration of acute lymphoedema attacks \[ **R6; G5, G6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

###  **1. National Podoconiosis Prevention, Control and Elimination Policy: Ethiopia & Rwanda** 

 Information from studies conducted by staff at the CGHR has shaped policy in two countries in East Africa – Ethiopia and Rwanda. The route to impact is via Neglected Tropical Disease \(NTD\) Masterplans, which each endemic country is required to draw up to receive donations for Mass Drug Administration \(community\-wide preventive therapy\). Due to the co\-productive nature of the research conducted in each country, CGHR members provided research\-based evidence as part of the development and writing of the Masterplans, thus ensuring the rapid implementation of their research findings. 

###  **1.1 Ethiopia – evidence\-based national NTD Masterplan and healthcare programmes** 

 <ins>LF/Podo integrated mapping</ins>. In Ethiopia, evidence from CGHR research on podo informed the first edition of the country NTD Masterplan 2013\-2015 \(Deribe K. et al., *Parasit. Vectors*, 2012\), and the need for a nationwide mapping of the disease. At subsequent national NTD review meetings, Deribe and Davey presented CGHR findings on podo mapping \[ **R1**\] and estimation of the disease burden \[ **R2**\], which in turn informed the Ethiopia NTD Masterplan second edition 2015/16\-2019/20 \[ **S1**\]. As a result, the country met two milestones for podo elimination \[ **S1**\] by 2016: \(1\) completion of podo mapping and identification of endemic districts \[ **S2, R1**\], and \(2\) burden assessment in 58 \(16%\) of the districts \[ **S2**\]. 

 <ins>Healthcare programmes</ins> <ins>–</ins> <ins>the Preventing Podo Project \(PPP\)</ins>. In 2014, Davey and colleagues were successful in securing a UK Big Lottery Fund grant for an implementation project coordinated by the Ethiopian National Podoconiosis Action Network \(NaPAN\) – an NGO bringing together researchers, policy makers, clinicians, and representatives of all groups offering care to patients with podo in Ethiopia. The PPP was a three\-year implementation project \(2014\-2017, GBP499,078 award \+ in\-kind/financial support, total GBP2,214,745\), aiming to extend small\-scale interventions of podo case management in the three regions of Ethiopia most affected by podo \[ **R1**\]. The successful project application was based on the CGHR research on the social \[ **R4**\] and mental health impact of podo \[ **R5**\]. The project contributed to the capacity building of 370 government health professionals and 182 health extension workers trained in podo morbidity management \[ **S2**\], with 67% expressing confidence in their ability to provide podo care \[ **S3**\]. As a result, 68,181 podo patients \(around 5% of the national total\) who would otherwise not have had access to treatment, were treated for podo and 115,653 individuals in podo endemic districts were educated on the disease through 1,150 community events, 55 district workshops, and 16 rounds of national radio campaigns \[ **S3**\]. A network of 18 patient\-led groups was also established for a more sustainable and accessible community\-based approach to podo \[ **S3**\]. Finally, the PPP was instrumental in catalysing \[text removed for publication\] \[ **S2**\]. 

 <ins>Development of the LF/Podo Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention \(MMDP\) guidelines</ins>. Davey and Deribe contributed to the development of the LF/Podo MMDP guidelines \[ **S4**\] via NaPAN, using CGHR data on the mental health impact of podo \[ **R5**\]. These research findings enabled advocacy for psychological and socioeconomic support to complement medical and surgical care, which ensured full reintegration of patients into their communities \[ **S4**\]. These findings helped to define the patient counselling element of the care package, alongside medical care. As of February 2016, the guidelines were used to train a total of 300 health care workers and full coverage of the MMDP guidelines had been achieved in 87% of endemic districts, leading to the treatment of 153,250 people \[ **S2**\]. 

 <ins>Lymphoedema Management Package</ins>. The GoLBeT trial provided the research\-based evidence for a simple treatment intervention on which to base national policy. It showed that a simple, inexpensive care package was effective in reducing the frequency and duration of acute lymphoedema attacks resulting in increased work productivity and quality of life \[ **R6**\]. In March 2019, the results of the trial were presented at workshops held to draft the third National Masterplan alongside CGHR research on podo burden assessment \[ **R2**\]. The GoLBeT care package is set to be incorporated in the next five\-year Ethiopian NTD Masterplan \(2020\-2025\) \[ **S5**\] and has been used by the \[text removed for publication\] \[ **S8**\]. 

###  **1.2 CGHR\-led podo research contribution to Rwanda NTD Strategic Plans** 

 In Rwanda, the CGHR research \[ **R3**\] has been described as “an impressive and substantial undertaking \[…\] reaching more than 1:10 Rwandans” and resulting in 282 community health workers being trained to identify podo cases \[ **S6**\]. The findings contributed to advocacy for podo interventions in the 2017\-2020 NTD Strategic Plan \[ **S7a**\] and CGHR staff advised on the podo elimination plan. In 2018, the study results were presented internally within the Rwanda Ministry of Health and underpinned the podo section of the 2019\-2024 NTD Strategic Plan, which sets the strategies to reduce the burden of the disease by 2024 \[ **S7b, S8**\]. Amongst these initiatives are the training of health professionals, establishment of 10 podo treatment centres in the most affected districts, and education of the population to the importance of foot hygiene and shoe\-wearing. Through Foot *work*, CGHR secured a three\-year \(2020\-2023\) implementation award funded by the IZUMI Foundation to support the government in this first step \[ **S8**\]. \[text removed for publication\]. The CGHR IZUMI award is critical for Rwanda’s government to implement the podo\-specific initiatives laid out in its NTD Strategic Plan, due to limited internal resources available to tackle this disease. 

###  **2. Global Advocacy on podo elimination** 

 CGHR research on podo prevalence and distribution mapping in Ethiopia and Rwanda has been pivotal for disease advocacy. In 2010, Davey was invited to give a presentation to the WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases department about podo which, until then, was not one of the diseases considered by the department. As a result of this presentation, the WHO NTD department integrated podo under its “other neglected tropical conditions”. This recognition by the WHO catalysed significant changes to policy development within Ethiopia. Through this recognition, the country was able to include podo in their 2013\-2015 NTD Master Plan and mobilise essential resources \(such as the network of district\-level NTD\-leads\) to control the disease \[ **S9**\]. 

 In 2018, the WHO NTD department put together a pictorial training guide on neglected tropical diseases of the skin for district health workers, to support capacity building in the diagnosis and treatment of NTDs. Davey and colleagues’ research informed the podo section of the WHO training guide \[ **S10**\] which has since been converted into an interactive new mobile phone app \[ **S11**\]. Dr Jose Postigo, Medical Officer, Skin NTDs team, WHO Department of Control of NTD, at the announcement of the app’s launch in July 2020, explained its significance as follows: 

 “This software application will quickly allow health care workers and the public to get information about a specific disease – such as its clinical features, management and geographical distribution – and also provide a list of potential diagnosis.” \[ **S11**\] 

 In July 2020, Davey and colleagues, \[text removed for publication\], put together a series of user\-friendly slides on podo for district health workers training on the disease. This includes the latest GoLBeT care package \[ **S12**\].

 **1.Summary of the impact** 

 Impacts are on decisions taken by Northern Ireland’s governing Executive, the Irish Government’s Department of Foreign Affairs \(DFA\), the Northern Ireland Office \(NIO\) and Northern Ireland’s political parties; and upon the knowledge bases of the Labour Party and the public. These impacts have been achieved via provision of expertise on the reintegration and employment of former paramilitaries, use of our four ESRC Northern Ireland General Election studies and our work with political parties on membership surveys. Impacts include a\) changes by the Northern Ireland Executive on employer recruitment of individuals with conflict\-related convictions; b\) anti\-sectarian dialogue with Unionists by Sinn Féin; c\) rejection by the Ulster Unionist Party \(UUP\) of merger with the Democratic Unionist Party \(DUP\); d\) restructuring by Unionist parties to improve gender balance e\) adoption of proposals to restore the Northern Ireland Assembly by the British and Irish governments f\) training on the Good Friday Agreement \(GFA\) for Labour Party members and g\) media acknowledgement of our assistance in informing the public on key political issues.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research is as follows: 

 On reintegrating former prisoners, via various research projects \(including a Leverhulme Trust study on Abandoning the Past \(Principal Investigator \(PI\) Shirlow; Co Investigator \(CI\) Tonge\)\) involving interviews with 150\+ republican and loyalist former prisoners, yielding a book and journal articles \(example article at 3.1\). Our research showed that the Northern Ireland Executive had not met commitments to prisoner reintegration in terms of removing legal barriers to employment, as required in the Good Friday Agreement \(GFA\), rendering ex\-prisoners subject to high levels of unemployment. Those holding convict\-related convictions could be legally vetted and restricted from access to financial services, travel, adoption rights and employment. 

 Measurement of public opinion via a\) Tonge’s PI and Shirlow’s CI roles on the 2010, 2015, 2017 & 2019 ESRC Northern Ireland General Election surveys \(3.2\) involved the design and conduct of large surveys of the Northern Ireland electorate’s party choices and political attitudes. Data from each are lodged at the UK Data Service and findings published in articles \(e.g. *Party Politics* \(3.5\) showing how generational effects outweigh party ones on attitudes to same\-sex marriage and abortion\). Our findings, presented to the Northern Ireland Office and Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, demonstrated how extensively the public desired devolution’s restoration, even though its institutions have been unstable. We showed: a\) support for the devolved Executive and Assembly created by the GFA remained extensive \(above 75% among unionists and nationalists\) even when those institutions were suspended between 2017\-19; b\) widespread \(88%\) opposition to direct rule from Westminster; c\) extensive cross\-community support \(70%\+\) for key power\-sharing principles, notably that the Executive must contain unionists and nationalists and that legislation should require support from elected representatives from both main traditions; d\) Cultural issues are the biggest sources of division, e.g. 92% of unionists opposed an Irish Language Act whereas 93% of nationalists wanted one; e\) Majority nationalist and unionist backing for social liberalization re same\-sex marriage and abortion laws; e\) Continuing inter\-communal division over Brexit, with 65% of unionists favouring EU departure and 85% of nationalists opposed, although Brexit had not thus far greatly reshaped constitutional preferences. 

 Research on political parties was undertaken via e,g. Tonge’s PI role on a Leverhulme Trust membership study of the Democratic Unionist Party \(DUP\) \(2012\-14\) and a similar study of the Ulster Unionist Party \(UUP\) \(2016\-18\). Both studies were published as Oxford University Press books. \(3.3 and 3.4\). This research undertook the first\-ever quantitative surveys of the DUP and UUP memberships, accompanied by almost 200 interviews with grassroots members, elected representatives and the leaderships of each party, along with focus groups. Findings included: a\) Strong opposition to merger with the DUP among UUP members, despite 3 sets of unity talks between the parties 2010\-17; b\) In addition to the near absence of Catholics \(less than 1% of the membership of either party\) women are under\-represented, with both parties more than 70% male; c\) Our membership studies showed most unionist party *members* opposed legalizing same\-sex marriage or abortion \(3.3, 3.4\). Our election studies demonstrated, however, that more unionist *voters* favoured legalization than opposed \(3.2, 3.5\) with age a more important variable than ideology.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Impacts have been achieved via 1\) changing the rules of the Northern Ireland Executive on the employment of ex\-paramilitary prisoners 2\) data provision to the British and Irish governments, select committees and parties on restoring devolved power\-sharing; 3\) influencing decisions taken by political parties via data from our party membership and election surveys and 4\) impact via parliamentary bodies, the Labour Party and media on knowledge, scrutiny and debate **.** 

 1: On the employment of individuals holding conflict\-related convictions 

 Research on former paramilitary prisoners led to Shirlow’s appointment by the Northern Ireland Executive as Chair of the Review Panel \( [www.reviewpanel.org](http://www.reviewpanel.org/)\) evaluating structural and legal barriers to employment for persons with conflict\-related convictions. 

 Shirlow’s recommendations to amend the 1998 Fair Employment Treatment Order \(FETO\) Section 2 \(4\) ensured any conviction for a pre\-Good Friday Agreement conflict\-related offence would no longer be considered unless directly relevant to the employment sought. His proposals were endorsed in The Fresh Start Panel report on the Disbandment of Paramilitary Groups in Northern Ireland, \(5.1a; see paras. 4.25, 26, 27 and section B2 of the report\) chaired by Lord Alderdice and then supported by the Northern Ireland Executive, which agreed to “urgently adopt recommendations by the Review Panel” that a\) the FETO be amended b\) that this guidance be implemented for public sector recruitment and vetting and c\) there should be greater transparency over all these issues \(5.1b; section B1 of the report\). 

 The impact of Shirlow’s research was that the Executive directed the Northern Ireland Civil Service \(NICS\) to amend the FETO, which had until this point permitted the vetting of individuals and their families who had approved or accepted the use of violence for political ends. This means such persons will have the same employment protection as other citizens. The Executive reiterated its commitment to FETO legislative change in 2021, having implemented the Guidance Principles in 2018 following Shirlow’s proposals and amended NICS recruitment policy. 

 As the Deputy First Minister stated, ‘Professor Shirlow produced a report that had a significant impact upon conflict transformation initiatives and policy\-making within the Executive. Notably it was adopted within the Fresh Start Panel report on the Disbandment of Paramilitary Groups… These recommendations were adopted in the Executive Action Plan in July 2016 and provide the basis for legislative change’ \(5.2a\). The Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service \(NICS\), Sir Malcolm McKibbin, \(5.2b\) confirmed: “Professor Shirlow has…effected change in terms of revisions to the Northern Ireland Civil Service recruitment policy and proposed legislative change to the Fair Employment and Treatment Order 1998…These developments are highly significant as they will reduce barriers to employment and enhance reintegration of people with conflict\-related convictions…important impacts that continue to develop societal relations…” 

 The Finance Minister \(5.2c\) directed the NICS to adopt the Guidance Principles, acknowledging the “helpful input that Professor Shirlow has had both to the implementation of the guidance into Civil Service Policy and Procedures and to assisting the process of conflict transformation by enabling those with conflict related convictions to gain access to employment opportunities *”.* 

 2:  On the restoration of devolved power\-sharing 

 The election data findings informed recommendations to the British and Irish governments and the Northern Ireland Select Committee that a\) restoration of the devolved Assembly and Executive continued to command public support b\) direct rule from Westminster had negligible support c\) devolution was restorable with modest institutional rule changes d\) parties opposing same\-sex marriage and abortion did not represent most of their voters, so Westminster could legalize pre\-devolution’s return but e\) Irish Language provision needed compromise given unionist opposition. 

 Shirlow was invited by the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Office to present research to help solve tensions over identity and social rights, advancing a framework based upon cultural value that was accepted as part of future government policy in Northern Ireland. The British\-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat \(5.3\) declared the research “fed into the preparation of new proposals…to restore the NI Executive and Assembly” …The impact…was to re\-frame the promotion of cultural value into present reconciliatory policies as a means of reducing antagonistic cultural expressions. A further impact of this work was the capacity it provided for a better understanding that parity of esteem and mutual respect does not simply require a rights or horizontal fix but requires building better governance.” The paper “aided our understanding that many of the social issues that are read as dividing the two main communities are in fact better understood as issues divided along inter\-generational lines” \(5.3\). 

 Our data showed how the public had NOT lost faith in devolution despite regular Executive and Assembly crises. Tonge’s oral and written evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee \(NIAC\) was cited extensively \(20 times\) in its 2018 Devolution and Democracy in Northern Ireland: Dealing with the Deficit report \(5.4\). The Committee noted our data showing continuing cross\-community support for devolved power\-sharing and its rules as reason for continuing to press for restoration, concurring with our evidence that the problems were more short\-term issues than those of institutional design \(see 5.4: e.g. pp.53\-54 of NIAC report\). Tonge advised the NIAC that the Assembly should remain for scrutiny roles \(5.4, pp.32\-38, NIAC report\) until fully reinstated \(the Assembly was restored in Jan 2020\). 

 The NIAC endorsed these recommendations for a holding scrutiny role whilst the Assembly was suspended, its report stating: “We recommend that the Secretary of State take legal and procedural advice … on how the committee system in Stormont could be reinstated to provide, at a minimum, a scrutiny function for locally elected MLAs” \(5.4, p.37\). The NIAC also cited Tonge’s opposition to transferring Assembly powers to councils, highlighting his view that “there may be 11 mini\-Stormonts with the same rows just transferred to local level” \(5.4, p.42, NIAC report\). 

 3: On decisions taken by political parties 

 The impact of membership surveys on political parties upon party strategies and composition is acknowledged in testimonials from the leaders of Northern Ireland’s main unionist parties, the DUP and UUP \(5.5a&b\). The surveys detailed each party’s \(lack of\) representativeness. The UUP leader acknowledged “the ‘uncomfortable reading’ could actually provide very clear challenges… the research has proven exceptionally useful in terms of identifying the occupational, gender and denominational make\-up of the party. It was also revealing to learn of the membership attitudes to cultural issues; social issues, political institutions and other political parties” \(5.5b\). 

 One impact was abandonment of UUP merger talks with the DUP. Three sets of merger talks between the DUP and UUP were held between 2010\-17 but our survey data showed only 15% of UUP members supported merger. The UUP leader stated \(5.5b\) “A benefit of the research is the confirmation, from the party membership, that there is no appetite for a merger with the DUP”. 

 The DUP leader’s testimonial states “as a party, we have benefited greatly from the research. The party leadership was fully briefed on the entire data findings, which have been used to help shape party strategy in a wide range of areas. These include the composition and roles of the membership, the roles of women, key party messages; the attraction of votes from within and beyond the unionist community; relationships with other political parties and inter\-community relations” \(5.5a *\)*. One such benefit was the establishment of a 1928 Women’s Committee to attract more women to the DUP and increase their candidacy. The membership survey showed women formed only 27% of the party and female election candidacy was lower, at 9% \(it rose over the next 5 years to 25% at the elections contested by the party in 2019\). The DUP Policy Director has used our election surveys to shape agendas, declaring that they “impacted significantly upon our party in understanding who votes DUP and why … highlighted the most important issues we need to address; and helped us tailor policy development and key election messages” \(5.5d\). 

 Our election survey data has influenced Sinn Féin’s approach to unionist identities, the need for reconciliation and anti\-sectarian strategies. Sinn Féin’s President, Mary Lou McDonald, commented: “The role of Prof. Shirlow has been invaluable in this process. He…presented his research and understanding of the Unionist community at our Ard Fheis…Prof. Shirlow has facilitated a number of informative exchanges between our party and members of the Unionist community. Prof. Shirlow led a series of inter\-community talks between unionists and Sinn Féin members…critical to sharing inter\-community perspectives and understanding of diversity within the unionist community...The impact of Prof. Shirlow’s work has been to shape an environment within which attitudes and opinions can be shared and openly debated” \(5.6a\). Sinn Féin’s leader in Seanad Éireann, Rose Conway\-Walsh \(now elected TD\) stated: “the research clearly demonstrates that many of the assumptions held by me and my colleagues regarding the Unionist population in the North are inaccurate…This was particularly evident in relation to attitudes to social issues. The importance of this evidence is that it demonstrates the cultural complexity of the North/NI and enables us…to frame strategies and provide transformational leadership” \(5.6b\). 

  

 4: Impacts on knowledge/understanding, scrutiny and public debate 

 Our dissemination of research to parliamentary bodies has helped improve understanding and scrutiny of Brexit’s political implications for Northern Ireland. Tonge was commissioned by the European Parliament \(EP\) Constitutional Affairs Committee to provide the first written and oral briefings on The Impact and Consequences of Brexit for Northern Ireland, praised as “excellent” and “significant” by the Committee Chair and a “resounding success” by the EP Directorate for Citizens Rights \(5.7\). Tonge’s oral and written evidence to the House of Lords EU Committee was cited in its 2017 report \(5.8\): “Professor Tonge told us: 89% of nationalists voted to remain, against only 35% of unionists. So, the binary divide is being reinforced in Northern Ireland by Brexit.” \(para.39, p.13\). The Committee urged that government “take account of the interests of the nationalist community to maintain its confidence” \(para: 6, p.75\) whilst concurring with Tonge that “special status is a politically contentious term in Northern Ireland”, to be avoided \(para 9, p.73\). 

 Tonge was requested by the Labour Party to write a Good Friday Agreement training programme for its members, explaining the significance of the deal and showing how our survey data indicates continuing support for its institutions and principles. The Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland commented that “his in\-depth knowledge and expertise have been pivotal…His insightful input has enabled us to develop a robust and easy\-to\-understand political education programme for all Labour Party members, ranging from MPs to party staff to local CLPs and activists” \(5.9\). 

 Our research also rectified knowledge deficits by informing the public how Northern Ireland votes and why, who joins its parties, whether the region’s divisions are thawing and how. The data has been used by a vast range of media outlets, including BBC Newsnight, BBC News, Radio 4’s PM, Today and Westminster Hour, Sky News, ABC, Observer, Guardian, Daily Telegraph, Irish Times, Washington Post, New York Times and Foreign Policy. 5.9 lists some of the hundreds of items. As an example of how our research informed the public, Newsnight \(5.10, with link\) used our election and DUP survey data to a\) show most voters backed legalising same\-sex marriage b\) quantify to a national audience the degree to which religious faith informs DUP members c\) demonstrate how DUP voters are different from party members in religiosity and social attitudes. These findings showed for the first time majority support for same\-sex marriage even among DUP voters. The Guardian *’s* use of our findings \(5.10, with link\) showed how the social conservatism of political parties alienated young people in Northern Ireland, only 1 in 3 18\-24 year olds voting. The research informed Tonge’s consultant role for a 7\-part BBC explainer series on N. Ireland. 

 An editorial \(5.10\) in Northern Ireland’s largest\-circulation newspaper, the Belfast Telegraph, declared: Professor Tonge “has made a valuable contribution to the debate on the social, cultural and political situation in Northern Ireland” *.* The editor asserted \(5.10\): “Professor Tonge has become a key part of the political offering in the Belfast Telegraph…Drawing upon his extensive research, which includes definitive membership studies on the DUP and UUP, he delivers unrivalled critical insight into the often opaque and complex world of Northern Ireland politics. His writing adds further intellectual heft to our reportage and frequently sets the agenda for debate here. Our readers undoubtedly seek out his expert views”.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In 2019, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that half of UK adults were financially vulnerable, with 8 million working\-age adults, 4 million children and 2 million pensioners living in poverty; a situation made worse by the COVID\-19 pandemic. A lack of ability to appropriately manage their personal finances can contribute to people’s financial vulnerability. The underpinning research investigated the effectiveness of different approaches to help adults in low\-middle income households to successfully manage their money. The findings created impact **by informing the policies** and **improving the practices** of national and community organisations that work **to reduce the public’s financial vulnerability.** 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The primary underpinning research was a joint project between Coventry University \(CU\) and The Open University involving Dibb, Appleyard and Roby, funded by the Money Advice Service \(2017\-2018\) as part of its What Works programme \(hereafter the MAS project\) \(G1\). The MAS project built on CU’s strong track\-record and coherent body of research on personal financial wellbeing, including projects funded by the AHRC, Barrow Cadbury, Carnegie UK Trust and internal Coventry University funding \(2015\-2018\), which involved Appleyard, Dibb and Research Assistant Aslam \(G2\-G5\). These other projects grounded the underpinning MAS research as follows: \(i\) informing understanding of the relationship between individuals’ behaviour and their financial capability \(G2, G5\); \(ii\) clarifying the institutional and other causes of financial vulnerability \(G3, G4\); and offering deeper insights into the role of responsible lending in increasing financial resilience \(R4, R5\). All projects \(G1\-G5\) contributed to developing the community, practice and policy network used during the MAS project \(R3\), with this network also subsequently used to support impact. Collectively these projects have been synthesised in a series of project reports and policy documents \(R3, R6\), and disseminated through internationally\-regarded journals and conferences \(R1, R2, R4\). 

###  Money Advice Service project 

 The MAS project \(G1\) included CU researchers Dibb \(CU PI\), Appleyard and Roby, with support from CU Research Assistants. Being financially capable can significantly improve an individual’s ability to make good financial decisions \(R1\-R3\). A research intervention with people in low\-to\-moderate income households showed that using teaching materials to improve these individuals’ financial understanding increased their ability to make good financial decisions. The research tested the effectiveness of teaching materials that introduced them to simple budgeting and saving tools. The tools were designed to improve their day\-to\-day financial decision\-making and help them build a modest ‘emergency’ fund to reduce their vulnerability to unexpected bills or financial shocks. The efficacy of several channels of delivering the teaching materials was tested with different participant cohorts. 

 Qualitative and quantitative data were collected across eight sites from 4,195 participants who were credit unions members, housing association tenants, local community residents and mature students from a HE college. Data were gathered pre\- and post\-intervention concerning people’s attitudes towards money, their financial understanding, financial capability and financial behaviour. Qualitative data were collected via personal interviews, workshops and focus groups; with quantitative survey data gathered using a Randomised Control Trial design. Actual savings data from three credit unions was reviewed to provide tangible evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness. The CU researchers were specifically responsible for the collection and analysis of the qualitative data. They also supported the design of the quantitative research instruments, contributed to the quantitative data analysis, co\-authored the final project report, and led on the project impact work; working alongside non\-academic project partners including Community Action: Milton Keynes, whose volunteers gathered data from local community members \(R3\). 

 The findings showed that the teaching materials and budgeting and savings tools improved the financial understanding of participants, so they understood how to budget, the need to save for the future and the importance of creating an emergency fund \(R3\). Qualitative feedback from the mature students and credit union members gathered in the months after the intervention also indicated improvements in financial capability, with many using their new skills to routinely save and budget. The quantitative data gathered from the credit unions involved in the project supported these results, showing that participants were more likely to budget and were saving an average of £21.73 more after one month \(R3\). Feedback from community volunteers in Milton Keynes found that the biggest effect was on reducing people’s spending. The final project report concluded there was: 

 ‘*…good evidence that a short, low\-cost, behaviourally\-informed intervention can work to improve financial behaviour and resilience, and can do so for people who are Just About Managing who are most in need of financial capability but tend to be hard to reach*’ \(R3: p.51\). 

 The findings also revealed more about the challenges people face and how they navigate the hard choices they encounter in managing their money. For example, new insights were gained into the complex role of emotional factors in influencing individuals to make economically inadvisable spending choices, even though these decisions sometimes increased their financial vulnerability \(R1, R2\). The intervention findings and the insights into individuals’ financial behaviour \(G1\) were central to the activities that later led to impact from the project.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

###  Overview 

 The impact of the research was to significantly influence the policies and practices of national and community organisations that work to reduce the public’s financial vulnerability. These organisations play a crucial role in improving individuals’ understanding of their finances and their ability to manage them effectively. Prioritising this route afforded good reach for the impact and enabled access to large sections of the public. Changing these organisations’ policies and practices provides a pathway to enable more individuals to access materials and tools that help increase their financial capability and lead in some cases to better financial decisions. 

 All achieved impacts have been undertaken subsequent to the underpinning research cited in section 2 and are attributable to it. The impact activities described draw on the underpinning research in several ways: \(i\) the findings have directly influenced the content of national and community organisations’ policies and practices; \(ii\) impact materials created for these organisations have been informed by the project findings \(G1\) about how individuals can be helped to manage their finances; and \(iii\) insights into suitable channels and approaches for disseminating materials have informed how impact is achieved; for example, the underpinning research revealed preferences among younger participants to manage their money using apps and web\-based platforms. These insights \(G1\) were the basis for a subsequent Coventry University Impact Acceleration project to create a free\-to\-use *MoneySkills* app \(S1\) as a vehicle for impact. The app, available via iOS, Android and in web\-based format, has been used by several of the national and community organisations. 

 Below, the scale and scope of the achieved impact on the policies and practices of national and community organisations is shown, and the links with the research findings explained. 

###  Impact on the policies and practices of influential organisations 

 Impact has been created with national organisations including the \(i\) **Money and Pensions Service**, \(ii\) **Salary Finance**, \(iii\) the **Centre for Community Finance Europe**, \(iv\) **Creditspring**; and \(v\) at a community level through organisations that work to reduce financial vulnerability, such as the **England Illegal Money Lending Team**. 

 After submitting our findings to the MAS Consultation on Working\-Age Money\-Management, we were invited to contribute to the future priorities and UK Strategy of the **Money and Pensions Service \(MAPS\)**, the national body formed from the 2019 merger of the Pensions Advisory Service, Pension Wise and MAS. Our findings showing the efficacy of digital education tools and the use of community partnerships to improve access to hard to reach audiences \(R2\), directly influenced the national future priorities, including in relation to the need for goals\-based saving \(S2\). As the Policy Manager at MAPS confirmed \(S3\): 

 “*Yes, your consultation contribution really helped. In fact, it fed into both our 2018/19 Business Plan and the Listening Document that is informing our national strategy.”* 

 His email also explains the impact of our findings on their future work, including through three subsequent MAPS projects: the *Youth Checkpoints project*, which focused on supporting younger people’s financial capability; *Money Supporters project*, which embedded financial capability in front\-line services; and a *local community partnership pilot*. 

 UK organisation **Salary Finance** \( [www.salaryfinance.com](http://www.salaryfinance.com/)\), which is recognised for its socially responsible approach to supporting employees’ financial wellbeing, used our research findings in a toolkit developed for its membership of over 500 UK employers, which represent circa 3 million UK employees. As Salary Finance’s Head of Financial Education explained, the research: 

 “… *played an important role in shaping Salary Finance’s practices in how it supports employers to look after the financial wellbeing of their employees. This impact is seen in the practical toolkit created for employers to design financial wellbeing support in their organisations”* \(S4\). 

 His letter gives specific details of three ways the project findings \(G1\) directly influenced the content of the financial wellbeing toolkit: \(i\) in emphasising the role of trusted ambassadors in supporting individuals to manage their money effectively; \(ii\) in demonstrating the importance for individuals to be able to access financial tools in a paper\-based format; and \(iii\) in encouraging the sharing of stories to help individuals talk about their money. 

 The **Centre for Community Finance Europe** \( [www.cfcfe.eu](http://www.cfcfe.eu/)\), a membership organisation for 46 credit unions across Europe, invited us to produce a CFCFE White Paper \(S5\) on financial capability guidelines informed by the underpinning research findings \(R1\-R3\). This was launched and promoted to its members, which offer services to 150,000 individuals in the UK \(S6\). The White Paper \(S5\) guided these credit unions on best practice: how these individuals can be helped to budget, save and set financial goals \(R3\) and avoid making emotional decisions that increase their financial vulnerability \(R1, R2\). This guidance included explaining the use of the *MoneySkills* app \(S1\). CFCFE state that: 

 “*… the research from \[CU\] has shaped and continues to influence our practices in the advice we offer to our credit union members about how they can support the financial capability of their membership”* \(S6\). 

 Direct feedback from the credit unions themselves shows that their practices in dealing with members who have accounts with them has changed as a result. For example, one credit union described it as a “great resource” and emphasised the need for resources like the MoneySkills app, while another is using the app to support the financial education of 18\-30 year olds \(S7\). 

 **Creditspring** \( [www.creditspring.co.uk](http://www.creditspring.co.uk/)\), a Fintech company, is using the *MoneySkills* app \(S1\) via its portal to support the financial stability of its 10,000 UK members, as their Marketing Executive explains: 

 “*The MoneySkills App is great for Creditspring members as the e\-zines are super easy to use and helpful. Everything is straightforward and easy to understand, which our members value”* \(S8\). 

 The underpinning research \(G1\) and contacts from earlier projects \(G2\-G5\) have led to our findings about suitable money\-management tools that use apps and web\-based platforms influencing the content of training offered by the national **England Illegal Money Lending Team**. This training has used the *MoneySkills* app in a virtual course to prevent people from falling victim to loan sharks, and to help them rebuild their finances. In the six months since the course started in mid\-2020, 123 people attended the training from organisations embedded within vulnerable communities, including: Citizens Advice, YMCA, Disability Advice, Big Local \- Local Trust, the DWP, schools, colleges, councils, housing associations, mental health charities and the police \(S9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Direct treatment costs due to dental diseases worldwide are estimated to be USD297,670,000,000. Untreated tooth decay is the most common disease worldwide, with a 35.8% prevalence in western Europe. Following the successful spin\-out of Leeds’ “Filling without Drilling” patent\-protected self\-assembling peptide \(SAP\) technology for treatment of early decay \(pre\-2014\), several new SAP products are now available for treating tooth sensitivity and tooth erosion and maintaining dental health. The Swiss company \(Credentis AG\), formed to market Leeds’ technology within Europe, has won two major awards and is introducing a new product treating periodontal \(“gum”\) disease, the sixth most common of all diseases. In 2017, the rights to the early caries lesion SAP treatment were assigned to a major transnational company, now delivering to a global market, including the US. In Late 2020 Credentis AG was acquired by Swiss dental company vVardis and is now a research and development arm of that parent company. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Self\-assembling peptides \(SAPs\) are synthetic oligomeric moieties of naturally occurring amino acids. Unassembled they exist as non\-Newtonian fluids. By manipulating intramolecular non\-covalent forces, the formation of fibrillar structures dominate, which provide a templated heterogeneous nucleation site for hydroxyapatite. SAP biomimetic regenerative technology for applications in oral healthcare developed out of multi\-disciplinary research at Leeds. This work was led by **Aggeli** \(formerly Royal Society University Research Fellow in the School of Chemistry at Leeds, then Lecturer until 2014\) and **Jennifer Kirkham** \(Professor of Oral Biology, School of Dentistry \(SoD\), University of Leeds until 2019\). **Robert Davies** \(Research Fellow in the School of Chemistry, 2009\-2012, Research Fellow in the SoD, 2012\-2019, now Lecturer in the SoD\) further developed SAPs for new applications and leads the work going forward. 

 Supported by EPSRC and the Wellcome Trust, **Aggeli** described the driving principles governing the spontaneous self\-assembly of β\-sheet forming peptides into fibrillar scaffold structures **\[1\]**. This included the ability to design in responsiveness to specific external triggers in order to control the assembly process. Funded by EPSRC and industry, further characterisation of peptide physico\-chemical characteristics has been taken forward by **Davies** to inform further rational design and elucidate mechanism **\[2\]**. 

 **Kirkham’s** group utilised enamel development as a paradigm for understanding the way in which extracellular matrix proteins control crystal nucleation, deposition and tissue architecture in mammalian biomineralisation. This was based upon the hypothesis that domains of negative charge on extracellular matrix proteins \(themselves self\-assembling\) were responsible for crystal nucleation during enamel biomineralisation **\[3\]**. The work was funded through **Kirkham’s** Wellcome Trust programme \(associated Wellcome Trust, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council \(BBSRC\) project grants, and EPSRC collaborative and Proof of Concept awards from 1998 to date\). 

 **Kirkham** and **Aggeli** used knowledge gained from an understanding of the way in which mineralised tissues form, combined with an understanding of the drivers behind peptide self\-assembly, to address unmet clinical challenges in mineralised tissue repair and regeneration. The Leeds researchers designed peptides that would be unassembled \(monomeric\) at pH values >7.5, providing a low viscosity, injectable fluid that would spontaneously assemble to form a 3D fibrillar scaffold under physiological conditions. In addition, peptides were developed to provide, via their amino acid side chains, domains of negative charge once assembled. The resulting 3D structures therefore mirror biological macromolecules found in extracellular matrices of the mammalian skeleton. 

 Translational, collaborative research between the two groups was funded by an EPSRC CASE \(Cooperative Awards in Science & Technology\) award, a Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust research award and the Leeds Wellcome\-EPSRC Centre of Excellence in Medical Engineering: “WELMEC”\). This research went on to test the hypotheses that rationally designed self\-assembling synthetic peptides could nucleate mineral crystals *in vitro* and *in situ* within artificial decay lesions in human teeth **\[4\]**. 

 Taking this information together, a proof of concept clinical trial \(with Prof PA Brunton, formerly Professor of Restorative Dentistry, Leeds, now PVC, Otago, NZ\) was carried out in Leeds, applying one of the peptides \(P<sub>11</sub>\-4\) to early enamel decay lesions in patients. The results provided unequivocal evidence of efficacy following a single treatment of the lesions with the peptide material, confirmed in case studies in general dental practice. One application reduced lesion size and shifted progression of lesion from ‘arrested/progressing’ to ‘remineralising’ **\[5\]**. 

  

 By comparing a range of related but differenced peptides, the Leeds researchers were able to identify the most important design criteria favouring mineral nucleation and promotion of crystal growth. Work funded by EPSRC\-Credentis AG and carried out by **Kirkham** and **Aggeli** compared the efficacy of these rationally designed peptides in repair of caries lesions and showed that P<sub>11</sub>\-4 remained the best performing candidate. 

 International collaboration between Leeds and University of Campinas Brazil has also demonstrated the viability of P<sub>11</sub>\-4 as a treatment for demineralised dentine and potential application for increasing bond strength in etch and rinse adhesive systems. 

 Work funded by Geistlich Biomaterials \(Switzerland\) and carried out in **Kirkham’s** labs in collaboration with **Dr Julie Burke** \(Lecturer in Oral Surgery at Leeds, now Associate Professor in Oral Surgery in Edinburgh\) and **Dr Xuebin Yang** \(Associate Professor in Oral Biology at Leeds\) demonstrated the ability of P<sub>11</sub>\-4 to promote bone regeneration and repair in a critical defect model *in vivo*. The group also carried out *in silico* modelling of the mode of action of P<sub>11</sub>\-4 \(with **Dr Sarah Harris**, School of Physics at Leeds\) that illustrated the molecular action of P<sub>11</sub>\-4 in nucleating mineral crystals in its assembled \(but not monomeric\) state **\[6\]**. These data led to proof of concept work to determine the effect of application of P<sub>11</sub>\-4 on periodontal repair \(regenerating the tooth supporting tissues including the bone of jaw and the periodontal ligament\). The data showed unequivocally that P<sub>11</sub>\-4 promotes periodontal healing and repair **\[7\]**. 

 In 2018, a grant was awarded by the University of Leeds’ Medical Technologies Innovation and Knowledge Centre \(funded by EPSRC and BBSRC\) to **Davies**, Deirdre Devine and **Kirkham**, School of Dentistry, Leeds to provide proof of concept data demonstrating that SAPs can be used as drug delivery vehicles for the control of periodontal pathogens \(ongoing study\). 

 The research programme illustrates how a multi\-disciplinary team of clinicians, chemists and life scientists were able to draw upon the physico\-chemical principles of peptide assembly behaviour and mineral nucleation ability to design biomimetic materials to recapitulate skeletal tissue development and so effect regeneration and repair across a range of oral healthcare challenges.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Context:** Untreated tooth decay in adults is the most common disease across the globe with an estimated 3 billion people affected **\[A\]**, yet the principles of treatment for dental decay have remained unchanged and inherently sub\-optimal for almost 100 years. The earliest sign of tooth decay is the “white spot” lesion, visible to the clinician on the tooth surface. There is no consensus view as to how this should be treated. Clinicians have three choices: 1\) monitor the lesion to determine whether or not it is getting bigger, then excavate and fill; 2\) apply fluoride treatments, then proceed as in \(1\) or 3\) place a small restoration. Ultimately all restorations will fail and need to be replaced by larger fillings **\[B\]**. Treatment currently costs the UK GBP2,000,000,000 each year within the NHS alone **\[C\]**, driving oral health inequalities. Drilling is feared by many patients, inhibiting their attendance at the dentist and so precluding opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment of decay as well as diseases such as oral cancer. Furthermore, restorative procedures produce aerosols, which provide a vehicle for droplet\-spread diseases such as SARS and Covid\-19. 

 Periodontal disease is the sixth most common disease worldwide **\[A\]** and the most common cause of tooth loss in the ageing population. Taken together, the cost of oral healthcare in Western Europe is USD101,970,000,000 **\[E\]**. 

 Leeds’ SAP technology provides a simple, aerosol free, cost effective alternative to current treatments \(costing less than a third of the most simple conventional filling **\[D\]**\), allowing the clinician to heal, rather than repair, dental decay. 

 **At REF2014**: Leeds’ SAP patented technology had been licensed to a Swiss spin out company that the University of Leeds holds equity in, called Credentis AG. Following first\-in\-man clinical trials at Leeds, Credentis obtained a CE label to market the technology, trademarked as “Curolox”, as a Class II medical device throughout Europe and Switzerland. The first product in the range, “Curodont Repair” was in early clinical use treating patients in continental Europe and Switzerland as a professionally applied product. A second product, Curodont Protect, had just been launched and a third, Curodont D’Senz had been formulated. 

 **Since REF2014:** 

 **New products/ new clinical interventions have significantly increased the reach of this technology, resulting in:** 

1.  Over\-the\-counter \(OTC\) products with SAP P<sub>11</sub>\-4 being made widely available: 

 i\) a new treatment for tooth sensitivity \(“Curodont D’Senz”\), produced by Credentis AG. Now in use in the EU and Switzerland **\[F\]**. 

 ii\) a classic toothpaste \(“Candida Protect Professional”,  produced by Mibelle AG \(subsidiary of Migros\) upon a licence to Credentis Mainly available in Switzerland **\[F\]**. 

 iii\) a specialised toothpaste \(“Emofluor Twin Care” from Dr Wild & Co\), produced by Dr Wild & Co upon a license from Credentis. Available in the EU and Switzerland **\[F\]**. 

 iv\) intensive protection gel against caries and erosion \(“Curodont Protect”\), produced by Credentis AG, Now available in the EU and Switzerland **\[F\]**. 

 v\) a consumer product portfolio “Curodont for Sensitive Teeth”, produced by Credentis AG has been launched Direct\-to\-Consumer. The portfolio contains novel products such as chewing gums and chewie’s as well as classic formats such as toothpastes **\[F\]**. 

  

 All OTC products include SAP P<sub>11</sub>\-4 at effective levels. Candida Protect Professional with SAP P<sub>11</sub>\-4 \(Curolox\) is the top of the line toothpaste of the Candida portfolio. Produced by Migros, the Swiss market leader for toothpaste following a new licence deal, the toothpaste sells around 250,000 units per year. Migros has a large market share in Switzerland and is one of the leading toothpaste brands in the country. 

1.  Curodont Repair Fluoride Plus being launched in the US in 2019, following a distribution deal with Straumann AG for the US market. 

1.  All products containing SAP P<sub>11</sub>\-4 being regulated as oral care products under US Food and Drug Administration Regulation 21 CFR 355 \(the so\-called fluoride monograph\). Formal regulatory approval or clearance is not necessary, but listing within the National Drug Code database is required. 

1.  The non\-exclusive rights to distribute Curadont Repair being given to Straumann AG **\[G\]** in 2017, a large international oral healthcare company and the market leader in dental implants and periodontal regeneration. Straumann is now selling Curadont Repair in key global markets, including the US \[ **I**\]. Additional indications of products with SAP P<sub>11</sub>\-4 are under negotiation. 

 **Impacts on commerce:** 

1.  Credentis AG was awarded the Swiss Excellence award \(for a new product containing P<sub>11</sub>\-4 introduced to the market place\) in 2015, following their receipt of the Swiss technology award in 2013 **\[F,H\]**. 

1.  An entirely new clinical application for the peptide technology has been illustrated by the Leeds researchers in regenerating the periodontium. Credentis AG is now proposing to expand into this new market **\[F\]**. 

1.  Credentis AG was acquired by Swiss dental company vVardis and is now a research and development arm of that parent company **\[F\]**. 

 **Investment by overseas industry:** 

1.  Credentis has invested GBP500,000 in a co\-development project with Leeds School of Dentistry **\[H\]**, in\-kind investment in a proof of concept study. 

 **The initial invention and Intellectual Property \(IP\) protection has enabled further pathway activities since REF2014 allowing for commercial exploitation:** 

1.  A new patent using the technology for tooth whitening has been published by Credentis, who are seeking to market this new whitening product in the near future **\[F\]**. 

1.  Five new patents have been published as continuation in part \(CIPs\) in the US by the University of Leeds team, strengthening the IP position within the US and offering other peptides for development **\[I\]**. 

1.  Over 200 publications on SAP P<sub>11</sub>\-4, including six randomised clinical trials on Curodont Repair – published across the international scientific community all showing superiority over fluoride varnish or other caries\-arresting medicaments.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Referrals to NHS gender clinics increased by 240% between 2013 and 2019, vastly increasing waiting times, during which the risk of self\-harm and suicide is known to increase. Cornwall’s research has shown that improvements to training on variant sex and gender and faith, for faith leaders and gender medicine specialists alike, have the potential to improve trans people’s wellbeing. Her work on ameliorative spiritual care for people undergoing transition, and on LGBTQI\+\-inclusive theologies, has achieved the following impacts: 

 <ins>Impacts on Public Policy and Services in Healthcare</ins> 

 Changes to healthcare policy by NHS Employers, and professional standards of care for World Professional Association for Transgender Health; influenced church policy on same\-sex marriage and gender transition blessings **;** ‘agenda\-setting’ contribution to Church of England Teaching Document on Human Sexuality, *Living in Love and Faith.* 

 <ins>Impacts on Practitioners in Healthcare</ins> 

 Contributed to the Royal College of Physicians’ professional qualifications in gender medicine, the first of their kind worldwide; and changed professional attitudes of teachers, clergy, counsellors and sexual health practitioners. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Cornwall’s work shows how theological categories relate to normative scripts of sex, gender and sexuality in Christian tradition, and that these are neither the most ethically productive nor the most generative of ideals available across the tradition. She has identified and constructed inclusive alternatives also rooted in Christian tradition. Her book based on her thesis, *Sex and Uncertainty in the Body of Christ* \(2010\) *,* is recognised as the leading and foundational text in intersex theology and established her scholarly reputation. Cornwall’s research from 2013 onwards, underpinning the impacts claimed here, focused on: 

1.  Variant sex and gender, religion and faith. This includes journal articles on the centrality of intersex people’s self\-narration \(3.1\) and the theological disruption of hierarchies of good/healthy embodiment \(3.2\), as well as a book chapter \(3.3\) querying the theological assumption that humans may legitimately be sexed only as male or female. 

1.  Sexualities, sex education and the churches \(3.4\) **.** The key finding was that trainee clergy given no opportunity to reflect critically on their own sexuality and gender are less likely to be able to minister effectively across their careers to people struggling with these identities. 

1.  Inclusive theology of sexuality. This included an extended theological contribution to the popular book *Sexuality: The Inclusive Church Resource* \(Darton, Longman and Todd, 2014\). 

1.  Theologies of non\-biological generativity. This led to a monograph \(3.5\) whose key finding was that the diversity of Christian theological traditions on binary sex, gender and biological reproduction have been occluded in church statements of the last 50 years. 

1.  Spiritual care for those undergoing gender transition. In 2016, the Sir Halley Stewart Trust awarded Cornwall £55,506 for the Modelling Transgender Spiritual Care: Pilot Framework for People Undergoing Gender Transition in NHS England Gender Clinics project \(2017\-19\). Among the key findings were that spiritual care has the capacity to impact positively on trans people’s wellbeing before and during medical intervention; that significantly greater healthcare chaplaincy provision needs to be commissioned; and that improvements to training on variant sex and gender and faith for both faith leaders and gender medicine specialists have the potential to increase trans people’s wellbeing. Outputs include a paper calling for improved spiritual care and financial commitment to specialist chaplaincy alongside care by core healthcare teams \(3.6\), and Cornwall’s forthcoming monograph on constructive theology and gender variance.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 Cornwall’s work on theology, sex, gender and sexuality has had a transformative impact on the policies of religious groups and healthcare organisations internationally. Her insights and recommendations have been implemented in new professional standards and training among those working directly with intersex and trans people. Her work on intersex characteristics and trans theology led to a partnership with an NHS gender clinic in the Modelling Trans Spiritual Care project; training professional and campaigning groups on intersex and trans equalities; her membership of a working party for the Church of England’s teaching document on human sexuality, *Living in Love and Faith* \(5.6\); membership of NHS England/NHS Employers’ project on capturing the lived experience of LGBT people and the impact of faith, chaplaincy services, health and marginalisation \(2018\-19\) \(5.8\); and consultancy for the World Professional Association of Transgender Health’s Ethics Committee and Global Education Initiative \(5.2\). 

 <ins>IMPACTS ON PUBLIC POLICY AND SERVICES</ins> 

 Cornwall’s work on Christian constructive theology, variant sex and gender has stimulated and informed policy debate and led to changed policy direction in religion and healthcare. It has foregrounded inclusive theological accounts of variant sex and gender \(notably intersex characteristics and trans identity\). Her research has informed policy direction across contexts and with professionals including clergy and chaplains, healthcare professionals, counselling and gender medicine specialists. 

-  Changing church doctrine, policy and practice in UK and internationally: new liturgy and policy recommendations on same\-sex marriage, and blessing for trans people **.** Cornwall’s work is cited by the Methodist Church Marriage and Relationships Task Group 2019 in its call for the Methodist Conference to enable same\-sex couples to marry in Methodist churches \(5.7\). It is also cited in a Dutch pastoral handbook on transgender, faith and the church. Co\-editor Prof Heleen Zorgdrager says: “As a direct fruit of the handbook and the positive press coverage it received, the Protestant Church in The Netherlands \(PKN\) realized that there was a need for new text materials in its books of order.” \(5.7\) In 2019, official authorised texts of blessing and prayer for trans people were published in the PKN’s book of order \( *Dienstboek II,* “Services of Blessing”, 61b\). 

-  Improving social welfare, equality and social inclusion within the Church of England; contributing to wider public understanding of human rights conceptions. Based on her work in Christian theology and sexuality, Cornwall was one of five invited academic members of the Theology Thematic Working Group for the Church of England bishops’ Episcopal Teaching Document on Human Sexuality, *Living in Love and Faith* \(2017\-20\), with particular focus on intersex and trans concerns \(5.6\). Cornwall is the key scholar cited on intersex. Rt Revd Christopher Cocksworth, lead bishop for the project, noted the “agenda\-setting” nature of Cornwall’s work on intersex \(5.6\). Most Revd Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, notes that the materials “will help the Church to live out its calling … as together we explore matters of identity, sexuality and marriage.” \(5.6\) The Church of England will make decisions and undertake synodical processes in light of the materials in 2022. 

-  Changing health policy and professional standards of care: Devon Partnership NHS Trust; World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Cornwall partnered with the West of England NHS Specialist Gender Identity Clinic \(GIC\) on the Modelling Transgender Spiritual Care project \(5.1\). Cornwall devised a new framework for spiritual care provision for its patients. The Deputy Director of Nursing, Devon Partnership NHS Trust has recommended to the Trust’s chief operating officer that three new chaplaincy posts be created \(5.4, testimonial\). Cornwall was consultant \(2020\-\) to the WPATH Ethics Committee and Global Education Initiatives, advising on changes to its ethics guidelines and framework \(5.2\). Cornwall’s 2019 paper on trans spiritual care is being cited in the forthcoming WPATH \(World Professional Association for Transgender Health\) Standards of Care version 8, due for publication in 2021 \(5.2, emails from SoC Ethics and Education chapters lead author Prof Gail Knudson\). WPATH’s standards of care shape the practice of gender medicine professionals worldwide. 

-  Informing changes to healthcare policy direction: NHS England. Cornwall contributed to NHS Employers for NHS England’s project Capturing the Lived Experience of LGBT People and the Impact of Faith, Chaplaincy Services, Health and Marginalisation, 2018\-19, informing policy direction on trans spiritual care with NHS England leaders along with professionals from the police, fire and prisons service. This led to the development of new policy and practice with regard to healthcare services \(5.8\) including recommendations to: review the 2015 NHS Chaplaincy guidelines to include reference to LGBT people of faith; develop strategic partnerships with key stakeholders who represent LGBT people of faith in order to address health inequalities; contribute to work of the new NHS LGBT advisory team on health inequalities, health and wellbeing, safeguarding, and intersection between faith and sexual orientation; and develop resources to help organisations promote inclusive environments welcoming LGBT people of faith. Jagtar Singh OBE, Chair of Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust and convener of the 2019 national project symposium at which Cornwall delivered training on trans spiritual care, reported that delegates “have committed to applying their learning in their workplace … and most importantly they tell us that the learning will benefit the people they serve” \(5.8\). 

 <ins>IMPACTS ON PRACTITIONERS</ins> 

-  Changing professional practice: new highlighting of spiritual care in gender clinics. Cornwall provided ethics training for nurses, psychotherapists, psychologists and speech therapists caring for trans people at the West of England NHS Specialist Gender Identity Clinic in 2015 \(5.1\). The same year, she gave training on the spiritual needs of trans people to gender medicine specialists at the scientific meetings of the British Association of Gender Identity Specialists \(BAGIS\), doing so again in 2018. In 2019, she gave a keynote speech to 600 people at the European Professional Association for Transgender Health \(EPATH\), including professionals from multiple countries and subdisciplines such as psychology, psychiatry, urology, surgery, gynaecology, endocrinology and occupational health \(5.2\). An EPATH attendee subsequently set up an initiative to include spiritual care in the forthcoming revisions to the gender identity protocol in NHS Lothian and the National Gender Identity Clinical Network for Scotland \(5.2\). 

-  Contributing to new Continuous Professional Development and training provision at the Royal College of Physicians. Cornwall contributed to the curriculum development of, and devised content for, the Royal College of Physicians’ new PGCert and PGDip qualifications in Gender Identity Healthcare in 2019\-20, leading to improved professional development training for gender medicine specialists with a specific acknowledgement of religion and spiritual care. Prof Della Freeth, Executive Director of Education, Royal College of Physicians, records “appreciation of \[Cornwall’s\] contributions to the work” to “support the professional development of clinicians and thereby expand and improve care for gender diverse people” \(5.3\). The course materials also cite Cornwall’s 2019 paper on trans spiritual care. 

-  Changing professional attitudes through improved training. The reach of Cornwall’s impact in changing professional attitudes and improving training is demonstrated by her expert training for diverse groups including counsellors, clergy, teachers, NHS staff, police, fire and prison service personnel, and ministers in the Estonian government. Specifically, training was provided to: 

        1.  Thirty counsellors at the Anglican Association of Advisors in Pastoral Care and Counselling \(2016\). Training was delivered on transgender issues and theologies of sexuality, benefiting the clients with whom these professionals work. One participant noted: “I work with several clergy clients for whom these issues are live, and also with similar young people … I will now be able to begin to listen to their stories more reflectively and with greater understanding.” \(5.5, questionnaire responses indicating changed attitudes to clients\) 

        1.  Spiritual advisers at the Diocese of Exeter \(2018\) on gender identity and sexuality, contributing to their professional development and benefiting their advisees. 

        1.  Fifty school teachers and senior education leads on theology, gender and sexuality through the Learn, Teach, Lead RE project \(2018\), benefiting both teachers and their students. Ed Pawson, diocesan education officer for the Diocese of Exeter, noted: “This has supported teachers in their work to ensure equality for all individuals, helping them understand how to support vulnerable pupils.” \(5.5, Pawson testimonial\) 

        1.  More than 500 Christian clergy and trainee clergy on intersex, transgender, sexuality and queer theology, including the Diocese of Llandaff \(2019\), Diocese of Peterborough \(2019\), Dioceses of Exeter and Truro \(2016\) and the Metropolitan Community Church Office of Formation and Leadership Development \(2015\). Rev Dr Thomas Bohache, continuing education coordinator for Metropolitan Community Churches, noted that Cornwall had “suggested ways in which we might go forward for greater inclusion in church and society” as clergy working for LGBTI inclusion \(5.5, Bohache testimonial\). 

        1.  More than 100 delegates from NHS, police, fire and prison services at the NHS Employers and Asian Fire Service Association development summit on Promoting Excellence and Inclusive Pastoral, Spiritual and Religious Care for All in Leeds \(2019\). 

        1.  More than 100 delegates at the Estonian Sexual Health Association \(Eesti Seksuaaltervise Liit\), including sexual health practitioners, clergy and government ministers \(2019\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Studies led by the University of Birmingham have provided definitive evidence for the effectiveness of home blood pressure \(BP\) monitoring for diagnosis of hypertension and improving BP control. This has led to **improved patient experience** through a **reduction in unnecessary treatment** and also **reduced NHS costs**. 

 Specifically, we have: 

-  **Changed international guidelines** on the use of home BP monitoring for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. 

-  **Changed clinical practice** as GPs now widely adopt home monitoring for diagnosis and assessment of BP.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 High blood pressure \(hypertension\) is a major cause of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases and is one of the most important global preventable causes of morbidity and mortality. In 2020, hypertension affected 28% adults in England \(around 15 million people\) and contributed to more than 75,000 deaths. Clinical management of hypertension accounts for 12% of visits to primary care and up to £2.1 billion of healthcare expenditure including £1 billion on drugs alone. 

 Control of blood pressure \(BP\) is often difficult to achieve and until recently has been managed solely in the clinic by healthcare professionals. However, the stress of visiting the clinic increases the risk of an elevated BP reading, and clinic readings \(CBPM\) do not show how a patient’s BP varies over time. Measuring the BP out of the clinic environment offers a better approach. 

 For this reason, **Ambulatory BP monitoring \(ABPM\)**, where a cuff connected to a portable monitor is worn continuously by the patient for a period of 24 hours, has become the gold standard method for diagnosing hypertension, but many people find it disruptive and there can be delays waiting for the appropriate equipment. **Home BP Monitoring \(HBPM\)**, where a patient measures their own BP, is an alternative option for measuring BP out of the clinic and has the added benefit of augmenting the role of the patient in their own healthcare. 

 Through a series of randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews, researchers from the University of Birmingham \(UoB\) have assessed the use of HBPM for the diagnosis and ongoing management of hypertension. In 2011, Hodgkinson led a systematic review to assess the relative effectiveness of HBPM, ABPM and CBPM for diagnosing hypertension \[R1\]. The results provided definitive evidence that \(1\) **both HBPM and ABPM are superior to CBPM** **for the diagnosis of** **hypertension** \(KF1\) and \(2\) **CBPM alone may result in substantial over\-diagnosis** \(KF2\). Based on R1, McManus and Jowett led a cost\-benefit analysis for the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\), which modelled the potential costs incurred by the NHS balanced against the health and quality of life outcomes for patients when diagnosing hypertension by the different methods to measure BP \[R2\]. This showed that **HBPM is cost\-effective compared to clinic monitoring of BP** \(KF3\). 

 The team also studied the potential of HBPM for use in **management of hypertension**. Through a systematic review they identified that self\-monitoring reduced BP in a range of international studies \[R3\]. Following this, through a series of randomised controlled trials \(TASMINH2 \[R4\]; TASMIN\-SR \[R5\] and TASMINH4 \[R6\]\), they have shown that: 

 KF4. Self\-management \(involving self\-monitoring of BP, self\-adjustment of antihypertensive drug levels and telemonitoring of HBPM measurement, in which readings made at home are relayed to a health professional\) results in better BP control and lower systolic BP compared with clinic readings in patients with poorly controlled hypertension \[R4\] and patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease \[R5\]. 

 KF5. Drug adjustment by GPs, guided by HBPM readings, lowered BP better than adjustment guided by clinic readings in patients with poorly controlled BP. No additional benefit for telemonitoring alongside self\-monitoring was seen over self\-monitoring alone \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research from UoB has **improved clinical care and outcomes** for people with hypertension by increasing the use of home blood pressure monitoring. This **improves BP control** and therefore: i\) **reduces the risk** **of stroke, cardiovascular disease and death** through improved treatment management, ii\) **reduces unnecessary treatment** by misdiagnosis and \(iii\) **increases** **engagement of patients in their own care**. This has been achieved through: 

-  changing UK and international guidelines on hypertension; 

-  changing international care practices for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. 

  

1.  <ins> **Healthcare guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hypertension have changed</ins> <ins>in the UK and internationally**</ins> 

 We have had **world\-wide influence on** **clinical guidelines** for the management of hypertension as **Canadian** \(2015\) \[S1i, ii\], **European** \(2018\) \[S1iii\], **Asian** \(2018\) \[S1iv\] and **American** \(2018\) \[S1v\] guidelines all now recommend HBPM as an alternative to ABPM, to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension \[R1\]. This brings them in line with **UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\)** guidance which changed in 2011 based on our research \[R1 and R2\] to recommend “if a person is unable to tolerate ABPM, HBPM is a suitable alternative to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension.” \[recommendation 7.6.10, S1vii\] 

 UK and international guidelines have also changed to support HBPM for ongoing monitoring of hypertension: 

-  **In the UK, new NICE guidance introduced in 2019** recommends clinicians to “Advise people with hypertension who choose to self\-monitor their blood pressure to use HBPM” \[recommendation 1.4.17, S1viiia, p. 12; R4, R6\]. They also highlight that telemonitoring may not improve blood pressure control compared to self\-monitoring, stating, “the evidence was not sufficient to support a clear benefit of this technique.” \[S1viiib, p. 33; R4, R6\]. 

-  **European guidelines** now state HBPM is “increasingly used by patients to monitor their BP control,” and identify the benefit this brings to patients in that it “increases their engagement and may improve their adherence to treatment and BP control.” \[S1iii, p. 3038, ref 61,102; R5, R6\]. 

-  **Asian guidelines** now recommend, “Self\-monitoring and self\-titration may be feasible if carefully monitored by healthcare professionals and help improve BP control \(Recommendation 5b\).” \[S1iv; R5\]. 

-  **American guidelines** now advise “Out\-of\-office BP measurements to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and for titration of BP\-lowering medication, in conjunction with telehealth counselling or clinical interventions.” \[Recommendation S4.2\-3, Class 1 Level A; S1v, p. e24;  R5\]. During the COVID\-19 pandemic, **a policy statement urging broader adoption of self\-measured blood pressure monitoring** \(SMBP\) was also released by the American Heart Association and American Medical Association based on national guidelines. Its lead author stated “with fewer patients visiting medical offices during the COVID\-19 pandemic, SMBP monitoring is more important than ever for people at risk for hypertension and uncontrolled BP” \[S1vi\]. 

1.  <ins> **GPs have changed care practices for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with hypertension**</ins> 

 **Use of HBPM to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension has more than doubled during this REF period** according to Clinical Practice Research Datalink \(CPRD\) data between 2006 and 2017 \[S2\] and a national survey of GPs which indicated a rise in use of HBPM for diagnosis from 37% in 2011 to 58% in 2015 \[S3\]. A survey in 2020 further shows that **nearly** **all GPs \(88%\) are now using HBPM to diagnose hypertension** with 50% using it as their preferred method. **Most GPs \(96%\) are also using HBPM for ongoing management of hypertension** and 80% confirm they are more likely to use HBPM now than 10 years ago \[S4\]. 

  

 We have contributed to this change in clinical practice, not only through influencing clinical guidelines, but also through **raising awareness of HBPM** directly with clinicians via an in\-depth online learning module that provides practical guidance on blood pressure measurement \[S5i\]. This was published by the BMJ in 2011 and updated in January 2020. The module is now accredited by over 20 international organisations \[S5i\]. It has been completed by 12,846 clinicians; 623 feedback reviews have been left, nearly all of which are positive \[S5ii\]. 

 We have also supported clinician training in HBPM through Martin’s work with the **British and Irish Hypertension Society \(BHIS\)**, the main UK society for clinicians in hypertension. As a member of the Executive team and now President, Martin has promoted HBPM through **annual meetings, courses, workshops and online materials** \[S6i\-ii\]. For example, Martin led an MSc\-accredited course on management of hypertension in primary care. In 2016, 90% rated the session on measurement of BP as “excellent” and attendees stated the course “provided them with the clinical knowledge needed to help them to monitor hypertension in primary care.” \[S6ii\] As incoming president in 2019, Martin also hosted the Annual Scientific Meeting where she chaired a session on the new NICE guidelines during which the evidence around HBPM was debated. Attendees considered the session “excellent” and the “best discussion.” \[S6ii\]. The BHIS, supported by Martin through the Blood Pressure Monitoring Working Party, also **assists the public, GPs, surgeries and pharmacies in the choice of monitor for HBPM and raises their confidence in use of HBPM** by maintaining a **peer\-reviewed list of blood pressure monitors** \[S6iii\]. NICE and the NHS provide a direct link to this list in recognition of its importance \[S6iv\]. 

 These changes in clinical practice will have translated to **reduced NHS costs for the management of patients with hypertension** with savings coming from both a reduction in unnecessary treatment and in GP workload \[R2; S7\]. This is further supported by a 2020 survey of GPs which showed that 68% believed HBPM shortens consultation times \[S4\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A range of novel methods has been developed for supporting transactions between, and collaborations amongst, agents in a distributed ecosystem of services. Since 2015, Balena \(an SME that develops, deploys and manages connected devices\) has benefitted from Surrey’s research resulting in; company growth from 5 to 102 employees, a total of $31.4 million in funding, and a 280% increase in annual income reaching $1.9 million in 2020. Balena has also expanded its customer base, supplying solutions to a wide range of sectors, including drones and robotics, transportation, manufacturing, energy, agriculture, digital signage, and building management.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Our ambition in the programme of research relating to this case study was to provide a formal underpinning to the development of software infrastructure for SMEs to deliver innovative services and products on a global basis. Our work covered three broad areas: \(i\) generation of information systems from business requirements; \(ii\) foundational infrastructure for the development and deployment of innovative services; and \(iii\) organisational aspects of distributed and agile software development. 

 This work, led by Krause and Moschoyiannis, was primarily funded under an EU “Digital Ecosystem” theme \(2002 \- 2011\), applying the following Surrey\-defined definition: 

 ""A digital ecosystem is an interactive system established between a set of active agents and an environment within which they engage in common activities."" 

 Although very general, we had a specific architecture/environment in which the agents \(usually services\) were governed by models expressed in the SBVR notation **\[R1\]**. This, in conjunction with the then\-emerging move towards RESTful interfaces, enabled us to generate a suite of tools that could support service transactions within the context of a compiled SBVR model as well as the compilation of SBVR into SQL queries and persistence layer **\[R2, R3, R4\]**. 

 These afore\-mentioned publications were focused on the implementation level and resulted in a suite of tools published under an open\-source licence.  However, we also wanted to be sure that transactions amongst multiple agents/services within this environment were well behaved and recoverable, and so supported the architecture with more formal studies based on a true\-concurrency \(non\-interleaving\) semantics to ensure the framework would scale without the emergence of pathologies **\[R5, R6\]**. 

 While we had ambitions to embed this work in a fully open Peer\-to\-Peer architecture, with no central points of control or failure, the core framework still met the goals of providing a framework for deploying at scale fleets of agents whose behaviour, individually and collectively, could be easily adapted/updated via the structured natural language interface of our SBVR editor. 

 Our open\-source tools were tested out in production during 2012. The start\-up company, Renew, had developed bomb\-proof recycling bins that could be used in busy locations. *Renew* aimed to monetise this with advertising revenue from LCD displays attached to the bins. The concept won a contract with the City of London in the lead up to the Olympic games primarily because of the potential for rapid communication with the public, via the screens, in case of an emergency scenario. Our open\-source tools **\[R2, R3\]** were used to develop, deploy and maintain the display services across all the bins in the City, demonstrating the viability of these open\-source tools for the first time, which were built upon by Balena.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 It is estimated that by 2022, the number of connected electronics worldwide will hit 29 billion, of which around 18 billion will occupy the burgeoning internet of things \(IoT\) subcategory **\[S1\].** 

 Surrey’s research and development of novel methods for supporting transactions between and collaborations amongst agents in a distributed ecosystem of services underpinned the decision by Dr Alexandros Marinos – a former Surrey PhD student and PDRA – to found the start\-up company Balena \(formerly RuleMotion\) in 2011 with the aim of commercialising research outputs from Surrey’s Digital Ecosystem programme. Marinos was supported in this venture by Krause and Moschoyiannis, who together aimed to use Surrey’s expertise to make managing IoT devices as straightforward as configuring PC peripherals. Both Krause and Moschoyiannis continue as advisors to this company, with Krause also being a shareholder. 

###  Impact on Balena’s product offering 

 The conceptual basis, and many of the technical outputs from Surrey’s Digital Ecosystems research group, are deeply embedded in the products and ethos of Balena. Balena’s API platform, open\-sourced as “S3” **\[S2, S3\]** in its entirety, is a direct descendant of the work reported in **\[R2, R3\]**. SBVR is still used in production, and the system still compiles to SQL as described in these outputs **\[S4\]**. Founder and CEO Marinos states, “<...> it remains central to our core business and has been a key facilitator of our agile way of working.” **\[S2\]** 

 Balena’s first product, launched in 2012, was a syntax\-directed editor for SBVR that could compile structured natural language models to SQL **\[R2\]**; this remains at the core of the Balena API. The rebranding of the original company to “Balena.io” in late 2013 coincided with the full\-scale launching of their support for service management in fleets of IoT devices, which exploited the service composition and transactional research of **\[R1, R5, R6\]**. 

###  Balena as a catalyst for innovation 

 While the Balena product stack has been expanded significantly during the company's life, the Balena API remains at the heart of their IoT Infrastructure. Our research work **\[R2, R3, R4\]** was amongst the first to use “RESTful” ways of working with connected resources, and this remains at the heart of the Balena way of working. The use of a restricted set of verbs to interact with resources \(including devices, applications, users, and more\) provides a unified interface with which to interact with this diversity of resources. This way of working has almost universally replaced the baroque service\-oriented architectures prevalent at the start of the new millennium. However, what made, and still makes, the API approach scalable and easy to use was the embedding of REST into a structured natural language interface using SBVR and the automated mapping into an SQL persistence layer **\[R2, R3\]**. This means that users of Balena do not need specialised knowledge of the service\-oriented architecture and database technology in order to set up and manage a fleet of interacting resources **\[S4\]**. 

 This ease of setting up the management of a fleet of resources is an aspect of Balena that is repeatedly mentioned as a primary reason for moving to Balena by innovative IoT businesses **\[S5, S6, S7\]**. The robust transaction model **\[R4, R5, R6\]** is less visible to the SME end\-users but is recognised in terms of the quality of service they can provide **\[S5\]**. The concept of forward recovery formalised in **\[R5\]** is particularly important as it enables dynamic updating of micro\-services to be facilitated without loss of service. This is particularly important for safety\-critical examples, such as when Balena is used to manage fleets of drones **\[S5\]**, with even the updating of a complete software stack having been demonstrated mid\-flight. **\[S5\]** also reinforces how Balena enabled Skycatch to rapidly respond to a first\-time request for a fleet of several hundred of their surveillance drones, scaling from the operation of small numbers to fleets of potentially thousands of drones simply through integrating Balena into their product stack. 

 Ease of use is especially illustrated in **\[S6\],** where the use of Balena was used by Figure Devices to take a prototype idea developed in a maker space into production support of hundreds of instances. 

 The importance of being able to support live updates of software **\[R4, R6\]** without “bricking” devices \(making them unusable for a period\) was a key driver behind OpenROV’s migration to Balena **\[S7\]**. 

 However, Balena is not just a key enabler for innovation\-driven SMEs. The use of Balena to support one of Europe’s biggest IoT hackathons and subsequent use for Bosch’s own products is described in **\[S8\]**. Again, the Balena dashboard features here; a core part of Balena that originated in Surrey’s research programme **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 The appeal to such a broad customer base has led to an acceleration of demand for Balena; across all their customers, the number of devices supported by Balena’s infrastructure grew from c15,000 in January 2018 to over 70,000 in May 2019. 

###  Growth of Balena 

 Three years after moving the company’s base to Washington, Seattle in 2013, it managed to attract $9 million in venture capital from Threshold Ventures, GE Ventures, Ericsson, and Aspect Ventures. With a subsequent $5 million in funding, Balena geared up for expansion, flush with $14.4 million raised in a series B round led by OpenView and existing investors. The infusion has fuelled its workforce's growth, distributed across its Seattle headquarters, satellite offices in London & Athens, and globally. The number of devices on Balena’s platform is growing at a rate six times year\-over\-year, and that customer acquisition is on the upswing. Balena now counts Bosch, Booster, Allscripts, Tapp, Zume Pizza, OpenDoor, Sonder, smart home systems company Dwelo, smart roof start\-up Sense, HVAC monitoring and controls provider Enerbrain, and smart building controls developer Mount Kelvin among its customer base **\[S1\]**. 

 Balena has now raised a total of $31.4 million in funding since April 2015 **\[S10\]**. The last two years, especially, have seen accelerating growth in Annual Recurring Revenue, from just under $500,000 in January 2018 to $1.9 million in May 2019. The company has grown from 5 employees in 2013 to over 100 employees, distributed globally **\[S9, S10\].**

 1. Summary of the impact 

 **Yu** has pioneered the use of environmental DNA samples to measure the compositions of ecological communities. In 2016, **Yu** co\-founded NatureMetrics Ltd, the first commercial UK provider of DNA metabarcoding analyses to the global environmental impact assessment market. NatureMetrics enables clients to measure biodiversity with higher efficiency across the lifecycle of infrastructure projects, from pre\-project baselines to post\-project habitat restoration. NatureMetrics has grown very rapidly. By the end of the third full year of operation \(2019\), it had doubled gross profit. In 2019, a Series A investment funding round valued NatureMetrics at GBP7,500,000. Revenue in 2020 was GBP1,000,976, which exceeded 2019 revenue despite the COVID\-19 pandemic. As of December 2020, the company had 33 employees, including 15 with PhDs. The company has also had substantial impacts via its clients. It has analysed over 8,000 environmental samples from more than 15 countries across the globe for over 90 clients, benefiting governments, corporations, NGOs and the environment.

 2. Underpinning research 

 
Governments, lenders, consumers and the public mandate that society monitor and mitigate the impact of human activities on biodiversity, and private businesses are increasingly pledging “No Net Loss” or even “Net Gain” in biodiversity as a result of business operations. To achieve these goals, practitioners must be able to measure biodiversity accurately. However, measuring biodiversity and change in biodiversity \(""biomonitoring""\) is a labour\-intensive, error\-prone and costly process. For instance, conventional surveys of fish biodiversity require multiple rounds of electrofishing and netting and still fail to detect most fish species present. 

 In 2012, **Yu** led one of the first experimental tests showing that ""metabarcoding"" of mass\-trapped organisms \(in this case, arthropods\) could recover accurate estimates of species diversity and composition. Metabarcoding involves the use of the polymerase\-chain reaction \(PCR\) to amplify gene fragments, followed by high\-throughput DNA sequencing, allowing the many organisms present in a mass sample to be identified. This paper \[R1\] was included in the 2014 “Top Methods” issue of the journal *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*. 

 In 2013 and 2014, **Yu** conducted follow\-up studies \[R2, R3\] that compared metabarcoded mass\-trapped arthropod samples \(insect ""soups""\) against gold\-standard, morphology\-based biodiversity datasets comprising tens of thousands of arthropod specimens and bird observations identiﬁed to species level by expert taxonomists using thousands of person\-hours of effort. These studies showed that the metabarcode datasets produced estimates of species diversities and compositions highly similar to those produced by morphological identification. Crucially, the studies also showed that the datasets produced similar management decisions for two conservation applications, namely restoration ecology and systematic conservation planning. Relative to the morphology datasets, the metabarcode datasets were documented to be many times quicker and cheaper to produce, while also being auditable by third parties and less reliant on scarce taxonomic expertise. 

 **Yu**'s research \[R1\-R3\] provided some of the earliest evidence that metabarcoding can be a reliable and efficient method for biomonitoring of animals, plants and fungi, with direct application to environmental impact assessment. These studies, plus research by Dr Catharine \(Kat\) Bruce in a PhD studentship supervised at UEA by **Yu** \[Grant A\] and published in \[R2\] and \[R4\], provided the justification, evidence and credibility that led to **Yu**, Bruce and Professor Alfried Vogler \(Imperial College\) winning a NERC Follow\-on\-Fund grant in 2015 \[Grant B\] to co\-found NatureMetrics Ltd. Bruce was the CEO for the first four years, and **Yu** and Vogler are members of the scientific advisory board. 

 In a parallel development, in 2008 molecular ecologists started reporting that trace amounts of DNA in the environment can be detected via quantitative PCR and metabarcoding. Such ""environmental DNA"" \(eDNA\) comes, for example, from organismal secretions dissolved into water \(e.g. mucus shed by fish or amphibians\) or from organismal tissue released externally by other means \(e.g. residual vertebrate bloodmeals in leeches\). In particular, it was found that eDNA sampled from water bodies can be used to detect, identify and partially quantify the abundance of aquatic vertebrates, especially fish species. **Yu** co\-authored a highly\-cited review that showcased potential uses of eDNA \[R5\] and lead\-authored a research study showing that accurate estimates of fish abundances are achievable using quantitative PCR of eDNA present in streamwater samples \[R6\]. The combination of metabarcoding and eDNA is revolutionising biomonitoring, especially in aquatic habitats, which were previously some of the most difficult habitats to survey and are now among the most straightforward.

 4. Details of the impact 

 
**Yu**’s research has had a large number of impacts on a global scale, including the direct impacts of NatureMetrics Ltd on commerce and the economy, which have been followed by downstream impacts via the effects of NatureMetrics on clients, practitioners, production, public policy and the environment. 

 <ins> *Direct impact</ins> <ins>on commerce and the economy*</ins>: NatureMetrics began trading in 2016, starting with the use of aquatic eDNA to detect Great Crested Newts at building sites. Related to this, NatureMetrics developed a filter kit for aquatic eDNA and filed a patent, now at international application Patent Cooperation Treaty \(PCT\) stage \(WO2020128503A1\). The company has grown very rapidly. By 2019, its third full year of operation, it was processing 4,750 samples from 92 clients and over 15 countries, with approximately 60% of revenue coming from commercial organisations, 20% from government, 10% from NGOs and 10% from grant\-funded projects \[S1a\]. In 2020, despite the COVID\-19 pandemic, it processed 3,285 samples from 90 clients \[S1b\], with approximately 68% of revenue coming from commercial organisations, 6% from government, 8% from NGOs, 10% from grant\-funded projects and 8% from universities and research institutes \[S1a\]. By the end of 2019, it had doubled gross profit \[S1b\]. In June 2019, NatureMetrics raised GBP2,500,000 \[S1c\] in a Series A investment round that was oversubscribed by 2.5 times, valuing the company at GBP7,500,000 \[S1d\]. NatureMetrics then implemented a growth plan, which has been slowed but not interrupted by the COVID\-19 pandemic. Revenue in 2019 was GBP713,796, and revenue in 2020 was GBP1,000,976 \[S1b\]. The company's size in terms of numbers of people employed has also increased rapidly. As at December 2020, NatureMetrics had 33 employees \(headcount 33, FTE 31.4\), including 15 with PhDs \(headcount 15, FTE 14.8\) \[S1e\]. 

 <ins> *I</ins><ins>mpacts</ins> <ins>on</ins> <ins>clients, practitioners, production</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>public</ins> <ins>policy</ins> <ins>and the environment*</ins>: NatureMetrics helps clients undertake work that would be far more costly, or outright impossible, without the company’s services. The eDNA sampling kits and analysis services offered by NatureMetrics make biomonitoring safer for clients and their employees to conduct in challenging natural environments. The following is a selection of leading examples of clients and spheres of activity that have benefited from NatureMetrics: 

 <ins>NatureSpace</ins> <ins>Partnership</ins>: NatureMetrics is a key service provider to and investor in the NatureSpace Partnership, a private company operating the UK’s largest biodiversity offset market. NatureMetrics’s eDNA service makes it possible for NatureSpace to rapidly survey hundreds of ponds to model the distribution of the Great Crested Newt, a species protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981. Builders in surveyed areas can buy a licence to offset the effects of developments on Great Crested Newt populations, the fee rising with their modelled impact on the newt. This arrangement reduces costs and risk compared to newt relocation, while also funding the creation of four new ponds per affected pond. As of 2020, NatureSpace have raised GBP1,000,000 and created 100 new ponds, operating across 40 Local Planning Authorities in the UK. As NatureSpace Partnership’s Chief Executive has stated, “ *Without NatureMetrics’ technical expertise and early investment, we would not have succeeded*” \[S2\]. 

 <ins>Environmental Resources Management</ins>: NatureMetrics gives the multinational environmental consultancy ERM “ *a competitive edge over consultants using conventional survey techniques alone*,” as stated by ERM’s Chief Ecologist \[S3\]. A large part of ERM’s work consists of surveys of aquatic habitats to establish baselines for future monitoring \(e.g. to detect pollutant spills\), to identify offset sites and to select amongst alternative project sites. In 2016\-17, ERM piloted NatureMetrics’s kits in Sierra Leone. Relative to their standard methods, ERM sampled more safely, covered a larger area, detected four times as many fish species and halved survey costs \[S3\]. In 2020, ERM used NatureMetrics for surveys in Russia and Serbia and is now considering eDNA for further projects around the world. As ERM’s Technical Director stated, “ *ERM believes that eDNA provides both business and conservation benefits, and NatureMetrics role in developing the new technology has included assisting ERM to become a more informed consumer and user of eDNA*” \[S3\]. 

 <ins>Environmental charities</ins>: In 2019, the Freshwater Habitats Trust \(FHT\) used NatureMetrics’s kits to survey 21 New Forest sites where they had data from conventional surveys. Using eDNA, volunteers were able to detect more species and “ *\[a\]t low cost, collected data in a couple of days from a network of stream sites that would otherwise have taken a conventional 2\-3 person survey team most of the summer to visit*,” as stated by FHT’s Director \[S4\]. 

 Internationally, in 2018, Worldwide Fund for Nature \(WWF\) Peru surveyed a 390 km stretch of the Marañon River in Amazonian Peru and “ *fully achieve\[d\] their survey goal of detecting the spatial distributions of six culturally and commercially important aquatic species…, and we exceeded our goal by also detecting hundreds of additional vertebrate species, which we can now start to take into account in designing a sensitive index of basin\-ecosystem health….NatureMetrics has made it possible for WWF Peru to generate baseline biodiversity data much more efficiently and comprehensively*,” as stated by WWF Peru’s Associate Ecosystem Services Research Officer \[S5\]. 

 In 2020, Fauna and Flora International \(FFI\) collected aquatic eDNA in the transboundary Wonegizi\-Ziama Massif Protected Areas between Guinea and Liberia. A total of 112 vertebrate species were detected, including the endangered White\-bellied Pangolin. As FFI's Senior Programme Manager for West and Central Africa stated, “ *The key benefits to FFI are increased biodiversity data…reduced survey costs…and ease of sampling.…\[W\]e can increase the…coverage of our sampling at a reduced cost, and we can more fully involve local people in conservation monitoring*” \[S6\]. 

 The British Trust for Ornithology \(BTO\) is using NatureMetrics’s metabarcoding service for arthropods to measure the efficacy of restoration projects in Polesia \(a wetland running from Poland to Russia\). Reduced costs allowed doubling of sample size from 120 to 240 sites. As BTO’s Senior Research Ecologist stated, “ *Without NatureMetrics, we at BTO would not have had the capacity to carry out this part of the project, whereas with NatureMetrics, we anticipate an increased probability of success in achieving the aims of the Polesia project*” \[S7\]. 

 <ins>Regulatory standards</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>setting</ins> <ins>and end\-user e</ins><ins>ducation</ins>: In her role as NatureMetrics’s first CEO, from 2017\-2020, Bruce co\-led a working group of a European Union Cooperation in Science and Technology \(EU COST\) action, DNAqua.Net, that submitted to the European Committee for Standardization the first European Standard related to eDNA \[S8\]. Bruce will also be on the steering committee of the soon\-to\-be\-launched UK Business and Biodiversity Forum, a government\-supported initiative exploring ways businesses can act to reverse biodiversity declines. In 2019, **Yu** wrote a contracted “Think Piece” for the UK Government’s Environment Agency for England to design an R&D strategy for incorporating DNA\-based methods in the agency’s reporting \[S9\]. Lastly, in 2020, NatureMetrics was competitively selected as one of five small companies to join the UK’s High Speed 2 rail \(HS2\) Innovation Accelerator programme, the purpose of which is to accelerate the uptake of new technologies in building the HS2 railway. NatureMetrics was chosen to ensure the quality of HS2’s green corridor, including newly\-created woodland \[S10\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Centre for Theoretical Cosmology \(CTC\) at the University of Cambridge is engaged in long\-standing industrial collaborations with both Intel and HPE/SGI, which have brought significant benefits to these commercial partners through co\-design and improvement of high performance computing \(HPC\) hardware and software. 

 **\[I1\]** CTC has collaborated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise \(HPE\), resulting in new capabilities and improvements for the SGI UV2 and UV3 supercomputers. These were incorporated in the HPE Superdome Flex server, HPE’s flagship in\-memory system deployed by commercial customers with large data flows worldwide. 

 **\[I2\]** CTC has collaborated with Intel on advancing hardware acceleration on HPC systems, as well as creating in\-situ visualisation capabilities. Collaborative innovations have been released in open\-source libraries/applications used worldwide and incorporated in 150\-200 commercial graphics tools, and in Top 10 Supercomputers. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The CTC at the University of Cambridge has facilitated development of the necessary HPC ecosystem for 20 years through hosting and operating the COSMOS National Cosmology Supercomputer on behalf of the wider UK research community. 

 **2.1 Context:** An important component of CTC research is developing high performance computing \(HPC\) capabilities to advance the confrontation between mathematical theory and new observational data provided by huge ongoing cosmological surveys. The CTC has contributed *via* the Planck satellite analysis pipeline MODAL \[R1, R2\], designed to analyse the cosmic microwave background, and the computer code GRChombo \[R3\], designed to study black holes. Both contributions were only possible because of the effective use of cutting\-edge HPC. The HPE/Intel collaboration has enabled the co\-design of hardware to meet CTC requirements, with early access to the latest technologies and HPC software advances with expert developer support. 

 
 *Figure 1.* Planck workflow adapted from Shellard  ISC’15 lecture. 

**2.2 Co\-design of in\-memory systems:**  Impetus for new HPC architecture designs came from the extreme challenges faced by CTC research on Planck satellite maps of the cosmic microwave background, i.e. the MODAL pipeline. In 2010, Fergusson and Shellard published a general methodology \[R1\], which they applied to satellite maps produced by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe in 2012. However, they faced a huge computational task scaling this up by nearly two orders of magnitude for the Planck satellite analysis.  The MODAL pipeline contained conflicting requirements; the analysis of the cosmic microwave background \(pink, fig.1\) required terabytes of shared memory, while theoretical modelling \(blue, fig.1\) needed low\-memory compute\-intensive integrations. This required the CTC, with its industrial collaborators, to define a unique new HPC architecture that combined a large shared\-memory server from SGI, and hardware acceleration from Intel’s many\-core Xeon Phi co\-processors. On delivery in 2012, the hybrid COSMOS UV2 supercomputer was the largest shared\-memory system in the world \(15TB\) and the first to incorporate hardware acceleration. The resulting papers enabled by this system became some of the highest cited Planck science results \[R2\]. 

 **2.3 Exploiting hardware acceleration:** Apart from the codes MODAL \[R1\], designed to analyse Planck satellite maps of the cosmic microwave background, and GRChombo \[R3\], designed to study black holes, the CTC also developed the WALLS code \[R4\], designed to explore *topological defects* that resulted from phase transitions in the early Universe. To be run effectively, all three codes required dramatic speed\-ups, which were to be achieved using new offload programming models for the latest Intel accelerators hosted on the hybrid COSMOS platform. This succeeded \(in collaboration with Intel software engineers\) through vectorisation and parallel algorithms \[R5, R6\], while identifying new offload capabilities vital for in\-memory acceleration \[R4, E3\]. A key highlight was a speed\-up exceeding a factor of 100 for the Planck MODAL pipeline \[R6\] \(which received the HPCwire Award in 2015 \[E10\]\). Impressive speedups were also achieved both in WALLS and in GRChombo, which since 2018 has become an open source project supported by a growing number of numerical relativity/cosmology developers \[R3\]. These codes have been used to gain new physical insights in areas previously intractable. 

 **2.4 Developing in\-situ visualisation:** Visualisation is an essential component of CTC research, but requires unprecedented computing resources. This need has driven the CTC collaboration with Intel \(since 2014\) to pioneer *in\-situ visualisation:* a new paradigm, which analyses data “on the fly”, as it is generated, rather than *post hoc* as was traditionally the case \(see section \[I2\]\). In\-situ visualisation greatly reduces analysis timescales and has led to a wealth of scientific results, including new insights into the conjectured exponential expansion of the early Universe gleaned from Planck data \[R2, R7\], and the dynamics of *cosmic strings* simulated with GRChombo \[R8\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The CTC has longstanding industrial collaborations with Intel \(since 2003\) and HPE/SGI \(since 1997 with SGI acquired by HPE in 2016\). These collaborations are characterised by the CTC’s continual, intimate involvement in development of both hardware and software. CTC codes are used “ *to validate and stress test these early access systems*” \[E1\]. Impacts from this collaboration include: 

 **\[I1\] Transforming HPC hardware** 

 **In\-memory SGI systems with hardware acceleration:** CTC played a key part in SGI’s development of successive in\-memory server architectures through design specification and early\-access testing. CTC’s requirement for integration of Intel hardware acceleration \(section 2.2\) in the next shared\-memory SGI COSMOS supercomputer led to the new *MG\-blades* design, which was deployed in all SGI UV2 systems. Through optimising scientific codes for this architecture \(section 2.3\), the CTC COSMOS team, collaborating with Intel, contributed to improvement of the software stack support for *MG\-blades*. These advances gave SGI important guidance in designing the next generation UV3 systems, which included the co\-designed MG\-blade accelerator architecture \[E1, E2\]. 

 *“This collaborative work with the COSMOS team had an important impact on the definition of SGI UV2 and UV3 architectures, which were the flagship In\-Memory HPC servers for SGI from 2012\-2016 \[…\]. Beyond validating our early\-access In\-Memory architectures, the co\-designed ‘MG\-blades’ \[…\] became a generic feature available on all SGI UV2000 systems.”* HPE Fellow/Vice\-President \(former Chief Engineer at SGI\) \[E1\]. 

 The takeover of SGI by HPE in 2016 for USD275,000,000 was significantly influenced by CTC\-led innovations: 

 *The core technology for the In\-Memory platforms is what drove the interest for HPE to acquire SGI in 2016. \[…\] The value of combining In\-Memory computing with tightly coupled accelerators continues today.* HPE Fellow/Vice\-President \(former Chief Engineer at SGI\) \[E1\]. 

 **Next\-generation HPE Superdome Flex:** In late 2017, CTC and HPE co\-designed and delivered the world’s first, and largest, Superdome Flex server with tightly coupled hardware acceleration \[E1\]. HPE Senior VP and Chief Technology Officer, AI confirms that \[E2\] “ *the hybrid UV2 co\-designed with inbuilt accelerators, influenced the definition of subsequent in\-memory architectures, including the UV3 system and now the HPE Superdome Flex.”* 

 HPE VP stressed the importance of Superdome Flex in HPE’s roadmap for the Mission Critical/HPC Division, for which annual revenues are USD3,200,000,000: 

 *“The Superdome Flex server has become a core element in HPE’s Mission Critical product range \[...\]  It is a key platform for database users including Oracle and Microsoft SQL, while rapidly became the dominant platform supporting SAP HANA. Superdome Flex has been commercially successful around the globe on a wide variety of sectors/use\-cases,* *with publicly announced examples including India Oil Company \(Manufacturing\), Burger King Russia \(Retail\), Kubo.com in Japan \(Financial sector\), Danfoss \(Manufacturing\), Travelport \(Retail\)”* \[E1\]. 

  

 **\[I2\] Exploiting hardware acceleration and revolutionising visualization** 

 **Exploiting hardware acceleration:** The CTC was among the first UK sites awarded Intel Parallel Computing Center \(IPCC\) status in 2014 for their pioneering involvement in code innovation and modernisation on novel Intel many\-core and hybrid architectures \(section 2.3\) \[E3\]. CTC’s exemplar research codes, WALLS \[R4\], GRChombo \[R3\] and MODAL \[R1, R2\], were used to validate and stress test the new Xeon Phi coprocessor \(Knights Corner, KNC\) and processor \(Knights Landing, KNL\). Optimisation of these codes, in collaboration with Intel “ *provided key insights for both Intel and our broad ecosystem on best practices and application of the most advanced methods to deliver profound increases in performance”,* confirms an Intel Senior Director \[E3\]. Intel’s Xeon Phi processors have played a key role in recent HPC, with the second\-generation KNL processor being deployed in the world’s fastest supercomputers since 2016. By November 2017, KNL powered four of the top 10 systems and 19 of the top 100 \[E3\]. CTC’s work also helped improve Intel’s Manycore Software Stack \(MPSS\) and software developer tools \[E3\] with these key technical advances enabling hardware acceleration on UV2 and Superdome Flex. 

 **In\-situ visualisation:** Since 2014, CTC’s collaborative research with Intel has been at the frontier of visualisation technology, with intimate involvement in the development of open\-source visualisation libraries \(OSPray \[E4\], Catalyst\), and the creation of *in\-situ* visualisation capabilities on HPC systems \[E5, E6\].  Milestones of CTC research demonstrating these in\-situ capabilities have included: 

-  A benchmark real\-time animated visualisation of 10TB of cached WALLS data using the OSPRay ray tracing framework co\-developed with Intel \[E5\]; 

-  First visualisations on next generation Xeon Phi KNL processors using the Planck bispectrum, which required scaling OSPRay to many\-core systems \[E7\]; 

-  Together with Kitware Inc, creators of the popular ParaView graphics application, CTC combined *in\-situ* visualisation frameworks \(the Catalyst library\) with OSPRay’s HPC scalability. This was extended from fixed grids \(WALLS \[E5\]\) to complex unstructured grids \(GRChombo/Adaptive Mesh Refinement\) \[E6\]. 

 OSPray is now at the core of the Intel OneAPI Rendering Toolkit, which is widely used in medical data applications, the oil and gas industry, the defense industry, interior space planning software, and Hollywood CGI \[E8\]. 

 *“\[OSPray open\-source library use is estimated\] in the 150\-200 range from commercial applications like Autodesk’s “AutoCAD” to Dreamworks “MoonRay” Renderer used to make “How To Train Your Dragon: Hidden World”  \[…\] to Blender, which is itself used for everything from movies and television to automotive design. \[We are also using them\]* *in a large\-scale public outreach programme with the Discovery Channel, ‘Universe Unravelled with the Stephen Hawking Centre’,”* Intel Senior Director \[E8\]. 

 In 2020, in recognition” of their important extended contributions to HPC visualisation techniques”, the CTC was awarded the status of Intel Graphics and Visualisation Institute of Xellence \[E8\]. 

 Working together with Kitware, Intel and CTC have been using OSPRay and Catalyst libraries to create *in\-situ* visualisation capabilities on HPC systems, including incorporating unstructured grids for their GRChombo code \[E5, E6\]. These features are now available in Kitware’s open source, multi\-platform data analysis and visualisation application ParaView, which supports applications ranging from laptops to remote visualisations on Top 10 Supercomputers \[E9\]: 

 *“Thanks to our collaboration with Intel and your Center, these \[…\] capabilities have been incorporated into ParaView and are now available to our worldwide user base*. *New versions of ParaView are downloaded over one hundred thousand times every year. Commercial applications including aerospace, energy and automotive industries ranging from wind turbine to space craft to fusion reactor design.* *Many of these applications directly benefit from the work created by our collaboration with Intel and CTC.”* Kitware Senior Director of Computing.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The first wave of the COVID\-19 pandemic in the UK highlighted the vulnerability of care home residents and staff to the virus. Research led by Dr Laura Shallcross at the UCL Institute of Health Informatics provided critical insights into care home practices associated with infection and outbreaks. This work then informed key policy decisions regarding the care home sector: the prioritisation of limited testing capacity to focus on staff rather than residents; limiting of movement of agency staff between care homes; and provision of an infection control fund to enable staff to self\-isolate when unwell. Data gathered from this research were also combined into a single interactive dashboard which continues to function as the main UK care home data tool, informing all levels of government from local authorities to 10 Downing Street. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Research led by Dr Laura Shallcross at UCL has addressed a key challenge faced by care homes in the UK: that they lack routine surveillance of outbreaks and infections that might enable preventative measures to be taken. Since 2017, Shallcross has co\-directed the GBP2m, ESRC\-funded ‘Preserving Antibiotics through Safe Stewardship \(PASS\)’ research programme and led its data science work package. This project is a collaboration between Shallcross and colleagues across UCL; primary and secondary health providers; social researchers at the University of Leicester; designers at the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Inclusive Design; and one of the UK’s largest care home chains, Four Seasons Healthcare. Its aim is to design antibiotic stewardship interventions that are tailored to specific healthcare settings to counteract the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance \(AMR\) caused by the over\-use of antibiotics. Findings have so far included the identification of the most impactful interventions around behaviour and organisational change in antimicrobial stewardship in care homes \(a systematic review, **\[R1\]**\) and mapping the frequency, patterns and risk factors of antibiotic prescribing for elderly residents via a large dataset derived from the partner care home chain **\[R2\]**. Shallcross led the data science and research design and analysis underpinning these publications, addressing the lack of routine surveillance of care homes in the UK via a retrospective analysis of the administrative records of this large care home chain. Shallcross’ work on PASS has given her unparalleled knowledge of the data available on prescribing, infection and outcomes among elderly residents via care home administrative records, and experience of working with care sector providers to access this data in an efficient and ethically sound way. As a consequence of this research, at the outbreak of the COVID\-19 crisis, Shallcross and the PASS project had access to the only large\-scale, individual\-level infection transmission and control dataset in UK care homes. 

 In March 2020, Shallcross was awarded GBP200,000 from UKRI to undertake a mixed methods study to investigate SARS\-CoV\-2 infection and mortality in care homes using data from Four Seasons Healthcare and qualitative interviews with staff. This project was called ‘COVID\-19: Burden and Impact in Care Homes \(CATCH\-19\)’. Shallcross tracked active infection, hospitalisation and mortality rates among the elderly residents of 179 Four Seasons Healthcare long\-term care facilities between March and June 2020 to identify factors associated with infection transmission and mortality. The emerging findings from this study showed that lower staffing rates and higher occupancy were the main risk factors in infection, and that actual infection rates of elderly residents within these sites was considerably higher than Department of Health and Social Care \(DHSC\) assumptions at the time. The study also highlighted the high mortality rate in people who were not tested for COVID\-19, indicating the urgent need for a rigorous mass testing strategy in residential care settings **\[R3\]**. 

 Shallcross’ work on CATCH\-19 and PASS led to her being approached by Public Health England \(PHE\)/DHSC in Spring 2020 to lead a surveillance study in care homes that investigated COVID\-19 infection, immunity and its duration in English care homes. The VIVALDI\-1 study focused on care homes in England that mainly provided dementia care, or care to residents aged >65 years. There were two main objectives: to estimate the proportion of staff and residents who had been infected with COVID\-19 since the start of the pandemic; and to identify risk factors for infection and outbreaks in care homes. 

 Between 26 May and 19 June 2020, 95% of all care home managers were contacted by researchers from Ipsos MORI, and 56% \(5126/9081\) agreed to participate, with 160,033 residents and 248,594 staff becoming involved. The estimated proportion of residents and staff who reported being infected between 1st March and June 19th was 10.5% \(95% CI: 9.9\-11.1%\) and 3.8% \(95%: 3.4\-4.2%\) respectively. A total of 2,724 \(53.1%\) care homes had at least one case \[ **R4**\]. 

 The likelihood of infection and/or outbreaks was reduced in facilities that paid sickness pay, that had cohorted staff \(i.e. where staff caring for infected residents did not care for other residents\), that did not employ agency staff, and which had higher staff to resident ratios. The likelihood of infection and outbreaks was increased in facilities with higher numbers of admissions, poor compliance with isolation, ‘for profit’ status, and lower frequency of cleaning in communal areas. 

 The most significant implications of these findings were: 

-  Half of the care facilities surveyed had no known cases and therefore remained very vulnerable to outbreaks. 

-  Reducing transmission from staff required: a\) provision of financial support to the workforce to incentivise testing and self\-isolation when sick; and b\) investment to reduce reliance on agency staff and to increase staff to bed ratios. 

-  Available evidence supported the use of disease control measures such as cohorting and isolation. 

 Transmission from residents was associated with the number of admissions to the facility, highlighting the need to test and isolate new and returning residents **\[R5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 There are approximately 410,000 older people \(>65\) resident in UK care homes, all of whom are significantly vulnerable due to mental and/ or physical ill\-health. They are cared for by a residential adult care sector that is diverse and complex: there are 11,300 care homes for the elderly alone, 95% of which are independent providers and 80% of which operate only one site. 

 Initial UK Government COVID\-19 guidance for the adult care sector stated that no special measures need be taken, and that *“it is very unlikely that anyone in a care home will be infected”* **\[S1\].** By the beginning of April 2020, modelling from the University of Manchester and DHSC based on early care home COVID\-19 infections showed this assumption to likely be unsound: a prevalence of 75% was projected if policy remained unchanged. On the basis of her earlier research, Shallcross was asked in early May 2020 to work with NHS England, the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) and DHSC to set up the VIVALDI\-1 study and provide a robust evidence base with which to plan a response to protect this large, varied and highly vulnerable care sector and its residents. Shallcross’ research was initiated explicitly to supply the critical epidemiological data needed to identify the likely most effective policy measures for protecting care home residents and staff \[ **S2**\]. 

 Shallcross presented the study’s findings **\[R4\], \[R5\]** and their implications to the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) Social Care working group in June 2020. These findings were provided directly to senior UK decision makers in the Department of Health and Social Care, SAGE, and 10 Downing Street, thus delivering crucial insights into the risk factors driving the first wave of the pandemic. The Chair of the UK Government Social Care Sector COVID\-19 Support Taskforce writes in a letter that: “ *this research influenced my views on how to protect care home staff and residents from COVID\-19. The research findings informed recommendations that were published in the Social Care Sector Taskforce’s report, and subsequently largely accepted by Government and translated into practice through the Adult Social Care COVID\-19 Winter Plan.*” \[ **S2**\] 

 Referring to the early policy influence of VIVALDI\-1, UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance wrote in a testimonial letter to the Provost of UCL: *“This work informed key policy decisions in June/July 2020 regarding the frequency of care home testing, and strategies to reduce the spread of infection as detailed below:* 

 *• **Whether limited testing capacity should be used for staff or residents, and which care homes to prioritise for testing.** VIVALDI\-1 showed that per capita people in small care homes were equally as vulnerable \[as those in large ones\] and this changed the proposed testing strategy so that all care homes were tested, not just large care homes, as testing capacity increased.* 

 *• **Limiting movement of staff between care homes.** VIVALDI\-1 \[…\] results had a major impact on policy decisions/discussions with the care sector about how to ensure sufficient staffing ratios whilst limiting the number of staff who work across multiple sites.* 

 *• **Payment of staff sickness pay to ensure that staff could self\-isolate when unwell.** Findings from VIVALDI\-1 supported the decision to establish the Infection Control Fund \(ICF\)… This has led to a substantial increase in the proportion of care homes that report paying sickness pay to their staff.”* **\[S3\]** 

 **Implementing the recommendations of the VIVALDI\-1 report: impacts of testing, staffing and sick pay in the adult residential care sector.** 

 **Testing strategy in care homes:** Shallcross’ research directly informed the current approach of mass weekly testing for all staff in all homes \(currently hundreds of thousands of tests a week\). Each of the \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] positive tests between 29 June and 31 December 2021 among care home staff and residents represented a case that could have led to a dangerous outbreak in at least one residential care setting, in every instance infecting many of the UK’s most vulnerable people, placing extra burden on healthcare systems and potentially resulting in deaths, as shown in UK national COVID\-19 Pillar 1 and 2 test results **\[S4\].** 

 **Take up of Infection Control Fund \(ICF\) support for the residential care sector and workforce:** The ICF is a GBP6m fund to support adult social care providers, to reduce transmission within the sector and increase workforce resilience **\[S5\]**. The ICF was targeted at two of the VIVALDI\-1 recommendations to minimise COVID\-19 transmission in residential adult care: that movement of care workers between sites should cease, and that worker sick pay should be topped up by government. It was deployed in two tranches: the first \(of GBP300m\) ran until 23 July 2020, and the second half of the funding was released on 24 July 2020. In the period to 23 July 2020, GBP257,601,441 had been allocated by English local authorities to 14,156 residential care providers, and of that figure 24.7% \(across 8,411 providers\) had been spent on limiting worker movement between sites. A further 18.72% \(across 7,898 providers\) had been used to pay staff full wages following a positive COVID\-19 test **\[S6\]**. As noted by several of the corroborating sources here, without Shallcross’ research and the VIVALDI\-1 project neither of these factors in COVID\-19 transmission in care homes would have been identified and prioritised, and the scale of the problem \(as evidenced by the majority of care providers making use of the ICF for these purposes\) would not have been apparent. On 18 September 2020, the UK Government published the ‘Adult Social Coronavirus Winter Care Plan 2020\-2021’, in which the ICF was extended until March 2021, with an extra GBP546m available **\[S1\].** 

 **Ongoing impacts of VIVALDI\-1 on DHSC’s response to COVID\-19** 

 In addition to providing an evidence base for key policy decisions, the VIVALDI\-1 study also contributed improved data\-gathering and reporting mechanisms around COVID\-19 testing in care homes. VIVALDI\-1 linked information derived from care homes to the UK national COVID\-19 testing Pillar 2 results that were being collected through the national care home testing programme. Shallcross and her colleagues were the only team who were accessing and analysing Pillar 2 data in this way. In mid\-2020, Shallcross realised the potential of this data, which could be used to monitor SARS\-CoV\-2 prevalence in care home staff and residents by region and over time. She started producing short reports based on the dashboard for DSHC. These reports were presented to the DHSC Adult Social Care team and to Ministers via the Data Debrief Group, chaired by the DHSC Director of COVID\-19 Response. The interactive dashboard was being used up to the end of the REF 2021 period and beyond by DHSC to monitor the burden of infection in care homes, explore factors associated with outbreaks and mortality, and is shared with local directors of public health. The Director of the Adult Social Care Team at DHSC states: \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] **\[S7\].** 

 The insights into COVID\-19 infection in care homes have also directly informed vaccination policy and shaped the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation in December 2020 to prioritise the vaccination of care home residents and residential care home staff **\[S8\]**. In November 2020, the government further recognised the importance of the VIVALDI\-1 project by announcing plans to expand the study and provide an even more detailed picture of COVID\-19 infection in care homes **\[S9\]**. 

 The Director of Strategy for Private Testing, DHSC, concludes: *“As a direct result of \[Dr Shallcross’s\] findings, and thanks to intelligent and diplomatic pressure from \[her\], SAGE and DHSC changed their advice, and rolled out mass repeat weekly testing of staff across all care homes for the >65s in England. \[…\] Motivated by public service, \[Dr Shallcross\] showed real intellectual and moral bravery in her approach, and it is increasingly clear that her actions are likely to have contributed to saving many hundreds of lives.”* **\[S10\]** 

  

 The impact of the VIVALDI\-1 study – the speed with which it was established and its effectiveness in shaping and informing policy – has been recognised in its 2021 nomination for a Civil Service Award.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Thurston’s user\-led model of counselling for people with sight loss has impacted on blind and partially sighted clients, practitioners, and service delivery. She has raised the standard of counselling for people with sight loss by designing a training course, based on her research, to upskill counsellors to work with the specific accessibility requirements and psychological needs of clients with sight loss.  The course, delivered by the Royal National Institute of Blind People \(RNIB\) and accredited by Vision UK, won a highly commended award for ‘excellence in service, support and care’ in 2019.  Thurston has also greatly expanded the availability of specialist counselling services, where little existed previously. To date, she has trained 83 specialist counsellors, leading to a significant increase in counsellors in UK \(80% increase\) and Republic of Ireland \(460% increase\).  This has also led to an increase in choice for clients with sight loss, enabling RNIB to offer more local face\-to\-face counselling in addition to their other services. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Context:  Research at Abertay University, led by Thurston, has focussed on understanding the social and emotional effects of sight loss and how counselling works to mitigate these effects.  Through a novel programme of systematic case study research, Thurston designed a user\-led, practice model of C *ounselling for Sight Loss,* which was subsequently developed into an accredited training course.  The course, entirely drawn from Thurston’s research, up\-skills qualified counsellors to work with the specific accessibility and psychological needs of blind and partially sighted clients. Royal National Institute for Blind People \(RNIB\) collaborated by providing clinical vignettes and administrative support, including recruitment of participants, training venues and co\-facilitators. Vision UK accredited the course and managed the course accreditation process for individual course participants. 

 **Accessible information in healthcare:** Thurston, who is herself registered blind, examined the accessibility of health information for people in Scotland living with sight loss. Findings from a survey of 228 RNIB members across Scotland indicated that 90% of participants did not receive communications from NHS health departments in a format that they could read by themselves. This had implications for client privacy, confidentiality and a wider impact on life and healthcare in general **\[3.1\]**. This research was presented as written and oral evidence to the Health and Sport committee considering the Patient Rights Act \(2011\) Scotland.  Accessibility, within the context of a counselling service, is a core aspect of Thurston’s training course with participants challenged to consider how to make their counselling practices accessible to clients with sight loss e.g., in advertising, appointment notifications, contracts, signage, self\-help materials etc. 

 **The emotional impact of sight loss:  Thurston explored the emotional impact of sight loss, at a time when the literature was scarce **\[3.2\]**. Results showed that participants experienced negative impacts on mental health and found commonalities in their transition from sight to blindness. Thurston proposed a five–stage theoretical model to describe this process and suggested that different types of psychological support were needed at different points of the transition process. She found participants held negative expectations of counselling and a lack of opportunity to receive counselling when needed, particularly after diagnosis. Specific challenges associated with providing counselling for blind and partially sighted clients were highlighted. This study provides the theoretical underpinning for Thurston’s training course for counsellors. 

 **Counselling for sight loss:  Thurston went on to consider what kind of counselling intervention might mitigate the social and emotional effects of sight loss, and developed a programme of systematic case study research, which drilled down into the process and outcomes of counselling for clients with sight loss **\[3.3\]**.  Data was analysed using a Quasi\-Judicial Hermeneutic Singe Case Efficacy Design model to identify helpful aspects of counselling. Thurston led further case study research in the Abertay University Counselling Research Clinic \(Tayside Centre for Counselling\). The clinic offers free counselling for those in the local area, accepting both self and GP referrals. Multiple sources of data were collected about the process and outcomes of sessions with 21 visually impaired clients.  This all fed into the development of the user\-led counselling for sight loss model and subsequent training course. 

 **Rigour in systematic case study methodology:  Hermeneutic Single Case Efficacy Design methodology was used in the development of the model of counselling for sight loss **\[3.3\]**.  Thurston and other Abertay academics have co\-authored two chapters about this case study methodology **\[3.4, 3.5\]**.  It is based on the legal tradition of deciding on the validity of a case by examining competing interpretations of the evidence provided. In counselling research, a rich data set is compiled on each case subject including outcome measures, process measures, therapy session transcripts and independent post\-therapy change interviews. This evidence is systematically interpreted to evaluate whether: \(A\) This is a good outcome case and outcomes can be directly attributable to therapy \(B\) This is not a good outcome case or positive changes can be explained by non\-therapy factors. The conclusions are reviewed by an independent judicial panel, who arrive at a single consensus. In this way, n=1 has a level of rigour because of the volume of data analysed and the number of researchers involved in the analysis. 

 **Understanding existing service delivery within the sight loss sector:** To gain a better understanding of the existing provision of emotional support and counselling services available within the UK for people with sight loss, Thurston et al undertook a scoping survey **\[3.6\]**. More services offered ‘emotional support’, in the form of listening and information/advice giving, than offered ‘counselling’. Clients presented a wide range of issues including depression and anxiety. A quality standard issue was identified, as findings showed that, in some cases, clients received counselling from staff with no formal counselling qualification and that minimally trained staff were working with client issues such as depression, anxiety and self\-harm.  The researchers made a recommendation about the need for a national standardised framework for the provision of emotional support and counselling services for blind and partially sighted people in the UK.

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  **Clients with sight loss** 

 As a result of Thurston’s accredited training course, clients in Scotland, England and Ireland now have improved access to face\-to\-face counselling with counsellors who are skilled to work with their specific accessibility and psychological needs. In the Republic of Ireland, the number of counsellors trained to work with people with sight loss increased by 460% \(from 5 in 2019 to 28 in 2020\) **\[5.1\]**.  Within the UK, the number of counsellors trained to work with people with sight loss increased by 80% \(from 56 in 2018 to 101 in 2020\) **\[5.2\]**. The course has also led to an increase in choice for clients with sight loss in the UK, enabling RNIB to offer more local face\-to\-face counselling in addition to their online and telephone services **\[5.2, 5.3\]**. 

 *“Dr Thurston was instrumental in the development of the Counselling for Sight Loss training. To date we have run trainings in Scotland, England, NI and Republic of Ireland.  The training is based on Dr Thurston’s research as well as RNIB’s clinical experience. Training leads to an opportunity for accreditation via Vision UK. To date 83 people have been trained and 32 people have been accredited via this scheme, which has greatly increased the capacity to offer specialist counselling.” RNIB UK* **\[5.2\]** 

 *“One of the focuses of the training was to increase client choice.  RNIB run a successful counselling service, but only offer services online and telephone.  By training up other professionals we have been able to offer the choice of seeing a local counsellor face\-to\-face.” RNIB UK* **\[5.2\]** 

  

 During the development of the model of counselling for sight loss, Abertay University Counselling Research Centre \(Tayside Centre for Counselling\) provided face\-to\-face counselling for 21 blind clients, accounting for 15% of all client work. No other organisation in Tayside, Angus or Perth and Kinross offered this service, which continues to be used. Thurston also provides specialist supervision for the counsellors in the clinic who work with blind clients. 

####  **Practitioners** 

 As a result of Thurston’s accredited training course, 83 qualified counsellors have acquired new understanding, knowledge, skills, and confidence enabling them to adapt their practices to work with people with sight loss.  Evaluation of the course \(one month after completion\) evidenced changes in knowledge and practice amongst participants, Participants felt that the workshop prepared them to have a better understanding of the issues in clients with a visual impairment \(average score 9/10\), felt more confident working with clients with a visual impairment \(average score 9/10\) and felt more confident in dealing with issues of accessibility \(average score 8/10\).  The biggest reported impacts were: *“Learning about the different sight conditions…and the practical needs of clients*” \(informed by research paper **3.1**\) and *‘learning about the sight loss process’* \(informed by research paper **3.2**\).  A peer support group was also established for training participants to aid networking, peer support and supervision. 

 On completion of the course, participants had the opportunity to become accredited by Vision UK. 32 participants completed the accreditation part of the course. This has led to increased opportunities for employment. For example, RNIB secured emergency funding from the Scottish Government \(£11K\) and Mind \(£49K\) to meet the mental health needs of isolated blind and partially sighted people during the time of the Covid\-19 pandemic and were able to offer this work to the newly accredited counsellors **\[5.2\]**.  A formal evaluation of this initiative will be undertaken by Mind in June 2021. Anecdotal evidence from RNIB indicates clients found this additional service invaluable in supporting their mental health during the pandemic. 

####  **Service delivery** 

 Thurston’s training course has increased quality improvement and enhanced service delivery to blind and partially sighted people in the UK by ensuring that qualified counsellors have the necessary skills to equip them to work effectively with the unique needs of clients with sight loss. The course won a Highly Commended Award in the Vision UK John Thompson Excellence in Services, Support and Care Awards 2019, acknowledging its impact on service delivery **\[5.4\]**. 

 *“For the first time the training provides a structured framework to extend specialist knowledge to non\-sight loss trained counsellors in time efficient way. … People affected by sight loss need a specialist skill set to facilitate their mental health needs.”* RNIB UK **\[5.2\]** 

 *“Dr Thurston has been a driving force behind the Vision UK Counselling Accreditation Course … increasing the amount of proficient counsellors in the community.  Without Dr Thurston’s research, expertise and tireless work this course could never have gone ahead, and the process of accrediting counsellors would never have happened.”* Vision UK **\[5.5\]** 

 Thurston’s research has also influenced counselling service delivery in the Republic of Ireland. 

 *“Fighting Blindness is currently the principal source of counselling for those living with sight loss and their families in the Republic of Ireland.  I would like to emphasise that the initial training provided and the accompanying research material that Mhairi has authored, is a core component of our approach and our ethos of counselling provision”.* Fighting Blindness ROI **\[5.6\]** 

####  **Capacity building** 

 RNIB now have a bank of quality assured counsellors that can provide extra support to the organisation as needed. Clients can now be referred to the Vision UK accredited counsellors if they prefer face\-to\-face counselling. This was not possible before the training course. RNIB has also shown commitment to continuing investment in rolling out the course further. In 2020, they identified £36K to extend the training to a further 144 counsellors **\[5.2\]**.  Due to the Covid\-19 pandemic, accredited courses stopped running in March 2020.  Thurston has since been working with RNIB to transfer the training online, and this was piloted in December 2020 with 15 additional participants. This method of delivery will continue until Covid restrictions are lifted. 

 Thurston has delivered training about the emotional impact of sight loss to the entire staff of Scottish War Blinded, including directors, outreach workers and volunteers.  Those who attended the training reported an increased understanding about the emotional impact of sight loss and the process of ‘going blind’ and increased confidence in responding to this within their role supporting people with sight loss. 

 *“Many staff remarked both at the time and in later conversations how much they had appreciated \[the training\] and learnt from her. Many felt better able to respond to the service users they work with and do so with confidence and an increased understanding of what they are going through….* *Following the workshop, we recognised the importance of this topic for our service delivery and decided to include questions about the effect of sight loss in our annual quality assurance survey for our service users.”*  Scottish War Blinded **\[5.7\]** 

####  **Conceptual Impacts** 

 Testimonies from the CEO of Vision UK and the Parliamentary and Policy Manager of RNIB Scotland corroborate the conceptual impacts of Thurston’s work within the sector, particularly around raising awareness of the emotional impact of sight loss, the process of going blind and her model of counselling for sight loss. This has influenced the strategic direction and focus of their work and led to service innovation in the field of counselling. 

 *“Dr Thurston has chaired and spoken at Vision UK conferences bringing counselling and emotional support into the mainstream of discussions of issues involved in eye health, sight loss and blindness.  This is hugely important as this vital topic is often lost under discussions on medical eye research, social care, treatments, transport etc.…..Dr Thurston’s work has been at the centre of establishing and shaping the collaborative work of Vision UK around emotional support and counselling and influencing the work of Vision UK’s members who range from RNIB and Guide Dogs to the College of Optometrists, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the GOC.’* Vision UK **\[5.5\]** 

 *“Dr Thurston has regularly presented at large Scottish and UK Vision Strategy conferences highlighting the emotional impact of sight loss, the process of ""going blind"" and counselling for sight loss. Her ground\-breaking work on these three interlinked areas has led to service innovation in the field of counselling and evidenced understanding of the impact of sight loss to the benefit of service users and professionals within the sight loss sector in Scotland and beyond.”* RNIB Scotland **\[5.8\]** 

 Due to her specialist knowledge and research, Thurston was invited by RNIB to be part of a global awareness raising initiative about sight loss and mental health.  In collaboration with RNIB, Thurston recorded a series of 12 podcasts for a closed Facebook group called ‘My Blind Pen\-pal’ \(n=8000 members globally\) about the process of going blind, the emotional impact of sight loss and how counselling can mitigate these impacts.  In additional, Thurston compiled a global directory of counselling and support agencies for people with sight loss. The podcasts and directory are now available as an ongoing community resource for the group. 

 Thurston’s work is also being used by Rehabilitation Worker’s Professional Network \(RWPN\), the professional body for vision rehabilitation workers, to better support people losing their sight. 

 “*I have been directing our profession to look at how the workforce can better support people going through sight loss.  Emotional support and understanding how people do or do not come to terms with sight loss, is recognised as being a key area that needs greater professional development.  Mhairi's research was an underpinning source”*.  RWPN **\[5.9\]** 

 Thurston’s model has also served as a blueprint for researchers seeking to improve counselling services for blind and partially sighted people in Mexico. 

 *“My vision for service development in Mexico is to learn from Dr. Thurston the counseling model for sight loss and adapt it to the Mexican population…Mexico is ten years behind the UK, and Dr. Thurston has walked those ten years doing research, creating a therapeutic model for the emotional impact of sight loss used in the whole UK, and advocating for awareness and inclusion. I'm starting the walk of those ten years in Mexico. Her research is my guidance*.” **\[5.10\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Tactile Universe project makes current University of Portsmouth astrophysics research accessible to people with vision impairments \(VI\). Since its inception in 2016, the Tactile Universe has reached more than 9,000 members of the public, school children aged 6 to 16, and education and outreach professionals across the world, including over 350 with VI. Participation in Tactile Universe activities has increased interest and engagement in astrophysics amongst VI school pupils, making them feel both included and inspired. Educators across the UK have been trained to use the Tactile Universe resources, increasing their confidence when working with VI people and empowering them to change their science communication practice to be more inclusive. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 An important finding about massive galaxies in the Universe is that they come in two basic types: “spirals” and “ellipticals”. Understanding the physics behind these galaxy morphologies has been a key area of research at the University of Portsmouth’s Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation \(ICG\) since Thomas and Masters joined in 2007 and 2008, particularly through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \(SDSS\), and it is this research that underpins the Tactile Universe project. 

 SDSS has revolutionised our understanding of galaxies. In addition to studying individual galaxies in great detail to gain an understanding of their properties, SDSS allows for the study of large numbers of galaxies in a statistical way, allowing for conclusions to be drawn about overall galaxy populations in the Universe. ICG members have played a crucial role in SDSS during the assessment period \- in particular, Nichol has been a member of SDSS since 1993 and holds ‘SDSS Builder’ status, Masters is an ‘SDSS Architect’ and the current SDSS\-IV Spokesperson \(since 2016\), and Thomas is an ‘SDSS Architect’ and was the Science Team Chair for SDSS\-IV/MaNGA taking place from 2014\-2020. 

 The 13th SDSS Data Release \(DR13\) in 2016 was the first data release from the fourth phase of SDSS \(SDSS\-IV\) \(R2; 13 ICG authors including Masters, Nichol and Thomas\). From 2000 to 2009, SDSS imaged “most of the northern high Galactic latitude sky” \(R2\) in five different optical bands; this imaging dataset was then re\-analysed for DR13 and provides the data used in the Tactile Universe project. 

 We selected 10 morphologically distinct galaxies to create detailed tactile images of, with separate images created using DR13 i\-band \(red\) and DR13 u\-band \(blue\) data. The selection of these galaxies was heavily influenced by research from the Galaxy Zoo 2 citizen science project \(R3; 6 ICG authors including Masters, Nichol and Thomas\), in which members of the public classified the shapes of 304,122 galaxies in SDSS images over the course of 14 months in 2009\-2010. The findings from Galaxy Zoo 2 broadened our understanding of how galaxies of different types populate our Universe. The 10 tactile galaxy images created from this research form the basis of all the educational activities created for the Tactile Universe. 

 
The content of the Tactile Universe school workshops and outreach activities is underpinned by further ICG galaxy morphology research. Research led by Masters \(R4\) has shown that red spiral galaxies are more prevalent than previously thought and may represent a significant stage in galaxy evolution. This work was built on by Tojeiro \(R5\) who studied the star formation histories of both red and blue spiral and elliptical galaxies. Bonne joined the ICG in 2014 and worked with Masters to study the properties of the local Universe galaxy population using SDSS data \(R1\) and has more recently contributed to research describing the underlying physics and evolutionary processes which create red spiral galaxies \(R6\). To create a more representative selection of tactile galaxy images based on this research, we have included an example of a red galaxy with a clear spiral structure. Drawing on the body of galaxy morphology work carried out at the ICG, we have been able to create a more complete and compelling educational narrative around the process of galaxy evolution, involving discussions of what we know, and what still remains a mystery. 

 The main resources of the Tactile Universe are 3D ‘height map’ tactile images \(referred to as ‘models’\) created from monochrome galaxy images from SDSS DR13, where the brighter the source image pixel, the higher it is from the base of the model. These physical models can be produced by several techniques including 3D printing. Users of the models can therefore feel the shape of a galaxy by running their hand across the surface, without the need to see it, as shown on the right.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The focus of the Tactile Universe is on engagement with visually impaired \(VI\) groups, and is inspired by Bonne’s personal experience. Due to his status as a severely sight\-impaired person, he faced extreme difficulties when visual verification of galaxy properties was required for his research. This led to discussions on how this work could have been made easier for a VI researcher and how ICG research could be made more accessible to the wider VI community. From these initial ideas came the Tactile Universe, a public engagement project that makes current ICG galaxy morphology research accessible to the VI community. 

 **Context** 

 Studies by support charities RNIB and Vision UK have shown that VI people experience major barriers to accessing information at every stage of life, from early education through to higher education, employment and beyond. While 0.2% of the UK population aged 25 or younger are estimated to have a visual impairment, only 0.1% of UK higher education students were recorded as having a visual impairment in 2017. Physics\-specific statistics are limited but in the most recent Royal Astronomical Society membership survey only 0.3% of respondents reported “blindness” \(noting that this includes retired members and the likelihood of vision impairment increases with age\) compared to 3.3% of the entire UK population. Increasing the availability of accessible STEM educational materials is key to establishing better routes from school through to higher education and employment for this under\-represented population, which is where the Tactile Universe comes in. 

 **Project development** 

 The models were initially co\-created with VI adults to best meet their needs via 3 consultation sessions between September and November 2016. The project has had an impact from the start, with one member of the consulted group going from being “scared” of space at the start of our first visit, to asking us when we would come back again by the end. 

 The change of focus to VI school pupils started in November 2016, when a VI primary school pupil and her teacher attended an outreach event during our initial development phase; we used the prototype 3D galaxy models to adapt an existing activity so she could fully participate. The teacher said: *“...it was a really inspirational session, that had a huge impact on <name>... Realising how \[Dr Bonne\] had achieved what he had despite visual impairment gave her confidence to aim high... her mum said... ""What have you done to her \- she's told me she's now going to university to study science when she's 18.""*”\(S1\) 

 Since 2017 we have collaborated with a primary and a secondary school that both have ‘resourced provision’ for visual impairment, to develop VI accessible activities that use our 3D galaxy models and are based on ICG galaxy research. Between November 2017 and March 2018, 5 secondary school test sessions were held attended by an average of 15 VI pupils each time, and 3 test sessions were held at the primary school: 2 with whole Year 5 classes \(60 children including 4 VI\) and 1 with 10 VI pupils and their support staff. These sessions resulted in the creation of 3 \(2 primary and 1 secondary\) school workshops. All the workshop resources have been made freely available on our website where the resources page has been accessed over 3,000 times since it launched in 2018. 

 In April 2018 we won a highly\-competitive STFC Nucleus Award \(G1\) to fund a nationwide roll\-out of the Tactile Universe, by training people to deliver our school workshops and providing either a ready\-made kit or the instructions to create their own resources. 66 educators, including 5 VI people, attended 5 training sessions across the UK in 2019. 20 kits were distributed to attendees and others have indicated that they will create their own kits. The training resulted in changes in attitude towards engaging with visually impaired audiences \- following the training sessions in Birmingham and London, 100% of attendees reported an increase in confidence to explain galaxies to a VI audience \(S4\). 

 **Impact on school children** 

 Our sessions increased student interest in astronomy and also led to changes in behaviour, with a teacher at the secondary school reporting that “ *...our pupils with VI have developed a greater interest in this aspect of science and STEM subjects generally. Moreover, one of our Year 11 pupils has enrolled on an online teaching course on cosmology to further his interest and knowledge... His intention is to continue with this within post 16 education*” \(S2\). The teacher also stated that “ *all of our pupils have engaged in positive questioning and higher\-level thinking. Social skills have also been developed*” \(S2\). 

 Since 2019 we have delivered 6 workshops to 159 school pupils \(6 with VI\), with a further 5 school visits cancelled due to COVID\-19. Post\-visit teacher interviews and pre\- and post\-workshop pupil questionnaires show the impact of these visits. Overall, pupils enjoyed the novel approach to learning and came away with the clear message that ‘anybody can be an astronomer’. For example, 92% of secondary school pupils \(n=49\) agreed with this statement following participation in a Tactile Universe session, compared with 76% before the session \(S10\). The VI pupils in particular felt ‘included’ and ‘inspired’ by the sessions, with one teacher who observed her VI pupil in a session reporting that *“he talked about it for hours, at the end of the day he was so excited to tell his Mum and Dad”*. Teaching staff also noted that their VI pupils were more involved and engaged, asking questions where they would usually not, and being a more active participant with more of their peers \(S9\). Beyond our direct delivery, our resources have also been used by our kit holders to deliver workshops to their local schools reaching an additional 120 school pupils \(6 with VI\). 

 Internationally, we are affiliated with the International Astronomical Union\-funded AstroBVI project which has distributed kits featuring our models to 100 teachers in South America, Spain and Nepal. In the USA, Bonne has used our resources at IDATA \(Innovators Developing Accessible Tools for Astronomy\) workshops, engaging with over 50 teachers and students \(10 with VI\), and also ran workshops with 45 VI pupils attending Wisconsin’s School for the Blind. 

 By creating activities that are inclusive regardless of level of vision, our school workshops have also had an impact on the fully\-sighted participants. For example, one secondary school pupil said “ *It was good because we got to understand how <name> could use certain tools to help him understand what he can not see*” \(S3\). 

 **Impact on the wider public** 

 The versatile nature of the Tactile Universe resources is something that has been recognised by us as well as the delivery teams and teachers. The Tactile Universe resources have been incorporated into the wider ICG public engagement programme, reaching over 5,400 members of the public since 2017 at events including the ICG’s annual public Stargazing at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard event and Victorious Music Festival. An external evaluation in 2020 showed that the kit holders were “adapting the sessions to their own needs with success” \(S9\) and our resources have been used at a variety of events \(both VI and non\-VI targeted\) including the University of York Astrocampus events \(2019\-20\), the London Science Museum 2019 VIscovery day, and an International Astronomical Union gala in December 2019 attended by the King of the Netherlands, reaching over 3,700 members of the public. Bonne has appeared on national TV and radio to talk about the project, including news pieces for BBC South in February 2019 and January 2020, an interview on BBC The Sky at Night in October 2020 and numerous interviews for RNIB Radio Connect. The open nature of our resources means that they are likely to have been used in many more situations that we are unaware of. 

 **Impact on the education and public engagement sectors** 

 The Tactile Universe is also having a wider impact on educators and public engagement practitioners, and these sectors as a whole. Follow\-up interviews were conducted in 2020 with teachers who attended sessions that we delivered in their schools. The interviews revealed an unexpected impact on these teachers \- they reported having their confidence raised through participation in the sessions, and the external evaluator who carried out these interviews concluded that the sessions “provide a space for reflection and professional improvement” for these teachers. The teachers also requested help from us with other subjects, showing the value they placed on our approach \(S9\). Our resources will be included in the State of Ohio science standard model curriculum \(S8\). 

 The Kavli Institute for Cosmology in Cambridge has built on our resources in their ‘TouchAstro’ outreach project and the UK Astronomy Technology Centre in Edinburgh hosted a VI undergraduate summer student in 2019 who created multi\-material versions of our models \(S5\). Bonne has further facilitated this aspect of the project by advising others in the UK and internationally on how best to engage with VI audiences, through direct consultancy activities and collaborations, and presentations at public engagement meetings \(S6\). These include providing exhibit accessibility advice and training staff at the Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre, collaborating with European Southern Observatory \(ESO\) Fellow Dr Chris Harrison on a VI\-accessible show that premiered at the 2019 British Science Festival \(S7\) and consulting for the NSF\-funded IDATA project in the USA. 

 In 2017 we initiated a VI physics public engagement consortium, organising a meeting in collaboration with the Royal Astronomical Society to bring together people working on different projects \(the first of its kind\). This first meeting was held on 14 December 2017 with representatives from 7 projects. A second meeting, this time with more than double the number of attendees, held in Manchester on 15 January 2019. A third meeting scheduled for March 2020 was cancelled due to COVID\-19. 

 In conclusion, the Tactile Universe has reached more than 9,000 people across the world, including over 350 with VI, since 2016. Through this work VI children have increased their engagement with and changed their attitude towards astrophysics, non\-VI children have a better understanding of the needs of their VI peers, and public engagement practitioners are more confident and better equipped to engage with this under\-represented group. The importance of this work was recognised in 2020 when the Tactile Universe was selected out of 112 worldwide finalists as the winner of the Falling Walls Science Engagement Breakthrough of the Year, recognising achievements that remove barriers to scientific engagement \(S11\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Claire Crawford's research on the determinants of participation in higher education \(HE\) has been central to the debate and policy development on reducing inequalities in HE access and attainment across different socioeconomic backgrounds. Research commissioned by the Office for Fair Access has informed how universities evaluate widening participation activities, ensuring they are more effective in increasing access to HE for disadvantaged students. Work commissioned by the Sutton Trust on the use of contextualised admissions has been widely cited in HE policy discussions and reports and has informed guidance given by HE\-sector bodies to make admissions systems more inclusive. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Crawford's established body of work has focused on the role of higher education in social mobility, shedding light on how personal characteristics and family background can determine an individual's chances of accessing and succeeding in higher education. Her findings show, for example, that young people from poorer backgrounds are less likely to attend university than their wealthier peers, and even those who do are less likely to attend the highest\-status institutions and achieve the highest\-degree class. The research indicates that more can be done by universities to reduce gaps in entry and success by family background. \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] 

 Based on her expertise in higher education access, the Office for Fair Access \(OFFA\) commissioned Crawford, Dytham and Naylor in 2016 to investigate how Higher Education Institutions \(HEIs\) in England currently evaluate their widening participation activities, and to provide guidance on best practice evaluation methods. The research, led by Crawford, found that there was confusion about OFFA's stance regarding evaluation, what would constitute a 'good approach' to evaluation and what the minimum requirements were. It identified current practices and challenges in outreach evaluation work and areas where more guidance is needed, leading to the development of proposed standards of evaluation. \[ **3.3**, **3.4, 3.5**\] 

 Crawford, along with co\-authors at the University of Durham, was also commissioned by the Sutton Trust to conduct research into the use of 'contextual admissions' among the more selective universities in the UK. Contextual admissions criteria \(such as type of school an applicant attended, their socio\-economic background, or their personal circumstances\) are considered by some HEIs as part of the admissions process. Based on this information, HEIs can reduce grade requirements or give special consideration to students from disadvantaged  backgrounds. The research report \[ **3.6**\] offers insights into the difference that greater use of contextual data could make to the numbers of disadvantaged students entering HE, as well as recommendations for practice. 

 Crawford led on the quantitative elements of the research, which analysed administrative data to understand how widely contextual admissions are used and the effect on students. Findings include: 

-  While the gap in university access between disadvantaged students and their more advantaged peers has narrowed in recent years, the gap at the most selective universities remains stubbornly wide. 

-  Greater use of contextual admissions could result in a substantial increase in the numbers of low\-income students at the UK's most selective universities. 

-  There is little evidence that applicants from contextual backgrounds are being admitted to selective universities in large numbers or with substantially lower average grade requirements than those applied to their peers from non\-contextual backgrounds. 

-  There is little evidence to suggest that universities that practice greater contextualisation see significantly higher dropout rates, lower degree completion rates, or lower degree class results.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins>Informing outreach evaluation guidance and practice</ins> 

 Every year around GBP1,000,000,000 is invested in outreach work to improve fair access to higher education, but there has been a lack of evaluation activity to understand the impact of this work and ensure value for money. Warwick research on the evaluation of HE outreach activities \[ **3.3, 3.4, 3.5**\] has increased awareness of the importance of evaluation activity and helped to inform a step\-change in evaluation practice in the HE sector in recent years. 

 Crawford spoke about the research at the Office for Students \(OfS\) launch event in February 2018. Writing in a Wonkhe article in March 2018, Chris Millward, Director for Fair Access and Participation at the OfS, said: ""One of the key messages from Claire's speech at the launch conference that really struck home with me, was the role that the OfS can play in driving evidence\-led practices. So, I will be looking for all providers to improve their use of evidence and evaluation so that we can make sure that investment is being focused on the activities that are most effective."" \[ **5.1**\] 

 Crawford also gave oral evidence to the House of Commons Education Committee's 'Value for money in higher education inquiry' \(February 2018\). The Committee's report to Government \(November 2018\) quotes Crawford in saying there is not robust evaluation of HEIs' widening participation work and recommends a rigorous evaluation process. In its response to the report, the Government confirmed that it has asked the OfS to focus on evaluation as a matter of priority, to ensure that spending on access and participation activities by the HE sector is having maximum positive impact. \[ **5.2**\] 

 Crawford's research has informed advice given to HEIs by the Office for Fair Access \(OFFA\) and its successor, the OfS, on evaluating outreach. Millward confirms that ""The research had a significant impact, producing a set of Evidence Standards, which, for the first time, provided clear guidance on the claims that can be made from evidence produced using different evaluation methods. The publication and the subsequent OFFA guidance led to improvements in evaluation practice."" **\[5.1\]** 

 As Millward testifies, a second phase of the work was taken forward by the OfS and the resulting evaluation guidance was a key element in the regulatory requirements published in 2019 to provide guidance to HEIs on preparing their access and participation plans. He said: ""Dr Crawford's research played an important role in enabling the OfS to give clear advice about what good evaluation practice looks like and to identify areas where the sector needed to improve."" \[ **5.1**\] 

 Milward also confirms the impact of Crawford's wider body of research into the link between socio\-economic background and HE participation \[ **3.1, 3.2**\]. He said: ""Dr Crawford's research has influenced access and participation policy for a number of years. Prior to the establishment of the OfS, both HEFCE and OFFA drew on Dr Crawford's research \[...\] This research was often cited in OFFA access agreement and HEFCE student opportunity funding guidance and highlighted the importance of working with young people from under\-represented and disadvantaged backgrounds from an early stage in their educational journey.""  \[ **5.1**\] 

 In addition, Crawford was one of two academic partners who helped to develop the Scottish Toolkit for Fair Access \(underpinned by **3.3** and **3.4**\), commissioned by the Scottish Funding Council on behalf of the Commissioner for Fair Access. The toolkit is one of two pillars of the Scottish Framework for Fair Access, launched in 2019, and provides evidence on the effectiveness of outreach activities, supporting education practitioners to design successful interventions. \[ **5.3**\] 

 <ins>Shaping debate and guidance on the</ins> <ins>use of contextual admissions</ins> 

 Admissions in Context  \[ **3.5\]** has raised awareness of the role that contextual admissions can play in increasing access to HE for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, informing public and policy debate. Following publication of the report, Sir Peter Lampl, Chairman of the Sutton Trust and the Education Endowment Foundation, called for top universities to make contextual admissions a 'central element' of their admissions processes. \[ **5.4**\]  The report received widespread media coverage, including The Guardian, The Sun, The Times, BBC News, The Independent, Evening Standard, Irish Times, Buzzfeed, TES, Wonkhe and BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. It was also discussed in a number of comment pieces including in Times Higher Education, the LSE Blog and Advancing Access. \[ **5.4**\] 

 Crawford drew on the report's findings in her oral evidence to the Education Committee's 'Value for money in higher education' inquiry. The Committee's report to Government cites her evidence and makes a recommendation to support the use of contextualised admissions. \[ **5.2**\] The Government's response to the report acknowledges that contextual admissions have a role to play in widening access to HE. \[ **5.2**\] 

 Admissions in Context was also cited in the Scottish Commissioner for Fair Access 2017 annual report and feeds into the report's recommendations, including for universities to make bolder use of contextual offers. \[ **5.5**\]  In a ministerial statement at Holyrood, then\-education minister Shirley Anne Somerville gave her support to the Commissioner's recommendations on contextual admissions. \[ **5.5**\] 

 A number of sector organisations responded to the report and used it to inform their guidance to universities. Universities Scotland issued a formal response welcoming the report, confirming that Scotland's universities ""intend to take bold new steps on the consistency, transparency and promotion of our contextualised admissions"" and that ""our actions will directly address many of the Sutton Trust's recommendations."" \[ **5.6**\]  The Medical Schools Council published a report on good practice in contextual admissions in 2018 and endorses the Sutton Trust's recommendation that HEIs make greater use of contextual measures. \[ **5.7**\]  The OfS also encourages HE providers to consider the use of contextual data, referencing the report on its webpage on contextual admissions. \[ **5.8**\]  Its May 2019 Insight brief calls for more radical use of contextual admissions, citing the report's finding that universities are too conservative when making contextual offers. \[ **5.8**\]  In addition, the report is cited in policy briefings published by the Higher Education Policy Institute: the 'Manifesto for the new \(OfS\) Director of Fair Access and Participation' \(May 2018\), and Social mobility and elite universities \(December 2019\). \[ **5.9**\] 

 The report has been the basis for the Sutton Trust's policy work on contextual admissions, including discussions with the Department for Education, UCAS and the OfS on making Free School Meals data available to universities. The Sutton Trust is also in discussions with its partner universities on whether Sutton Trust summer school participation could be recognised across universities as a marker for contextual admissions. \[ **5.10**\] 

 Admissions in Context has been central to the debate on contextual admissions and the role they can play in making the HE admissions process more inclusive. As Sir Michael Barber, chair of the OfS, commented, February 2020, on the launch of a major review into the HE admissions system, there is now ""widespread recognition that certain aspects of the current admissions system are not working, and may be especially unfair on students from disadvantaged backgrounds"". \[ **5.11**\] Ultimately, the OfS and other key organisations in the HE sector are now taking action to reform the system to address these inequalities. The role of contextual admissions for students from disadvantaged backgrounds will be one of the key issues considered. Separately, a 'Fair Admissions' review is also being carried out by Universities UK. \[ **5.11**\]

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Morris began his research into coffee at the University of Hertfordshire \(UH\) as Principle Investigator of *The Cappuccino Conquests: A Transnational History of Italian Coffee* \(2004\-2007\) funded under the ESRC/AHRC Cultures of Consumption programme. The project analysed the commodity biography of Italian espresso, tracing the origins and evolution of the beverage from the 1880s to the present, the development of a distinctive Italian coffee culture and the industry that surrounded it, and the spread of what he termed the ‘Italian\-style’ coffee beverages around the world. It highlighted the ways these were adopted and adapted to suit new markets and coffee shop formats, and the agents behind this \( **2008, 3.1**\). 

 The research distinguished between the much longer history of coffee in Italy, and the development of a distinctive Italian\-style coffee culture based around espresso. Morris’s research analysed dictionaries, and health and cookery manuals to demonstrate, for example, that the term cappuccino, denoting a simple combination of coffee and milk, pre\-dated the espresso, but subsequently became associated with a beverage that could only be produced using espresso equipment within the coffee bar. It expounded on the nature and reasons for the development of the espresso\-brewing process, the utilisation of coffee by troops during World War 1 and the fraught relationship between coffee and Fascism. It showed how technical innovations introduced in the post\-Second World War era transformed both the material characteristics of Italian coffee and the culture that surrounded it. A combination of internal migration, urbanisation and electrification, along with a distinctive regulatory regime promoted the rise of the neighbourhood coffee bar using high pressure machinery that produced espresso topped with crema, and the standardisation of the beverage parameters that now define Italian espresso. Italian coffee culture was therefore less a manifestation of tradition, and more an expression of modernity that rapidly became an icon of ‘Italian\-ness’ \( **2010, 3.2**\). 

 Morris then explored the spread of espresso\-style beverages into international markets since the 1950s, combining historical research into trade publications with extensive use of oral history. Morris adapted Peterson’s ‘production of culture’ model to point out that the diversification of coffee styles within European and US domestic markets was comparatively recent, suggesting this was connected to the emergence of large\-scale ‘national’ roaster/retailers keen to protect their local market from external penetration. They promoted particular combinations of brewing styles, roasts and beverage preferences to create national coffee cultures that served as collective expression of banal nationalism. These were undermined, however, by a specialty coffee movement that sought to reposition coffee as a lifestyle product within key demographics, enabling it to be used as a prop for the fashioning of the self. Presenting Italian\-style coffees as premium products whose value added was reflected in their non\-reproducibility in the home, facilitated charging margins that supported the ‘experience’ offer embodied in the international coffee shop format. The brand personalities of coffee chains could themselves be used as an accessory for projecting individual identity \( **2013, 3.3**\). 

 Morris subsequently extended his research to explore the history of coffee more widely across the world \( **2013, 2017, 3.4, 3.5**\) culminating in his monograph *Coffee: A Global History* \( **2019, 3.6**\). Researched in archives and libraries attached to industry institutions such as the International Coffee Organisation, it brings together data from many sources, including significant numbers of previously unpublished images. Written for a broad audience, the volume introduces a new, five\-stage periodisation of coffee history, located in what theorists will recognise as the ‘world systems’ created around coffee. Starting with an analysis of the Muslim coffee trade that developed around the Red Sea during the 15<sup>th</sup> century, the book analyses how each of these five eras represented a new stage in the evolution of the nature of coffee \(Wine of Islam, Colonial Good, Industrial Product, Global Commodity, Specialty Beverage\) and how each was characterised by a different set of dominant producers, labour regimes, intermediary agents, merchandise forms, brewing methods and service outlets. His work uses this developmental arc to interrogate key questions around the sustainability of the coffee sector today.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Morris has achieved impact through: his work with the coffee industry; as an educator and influencer across the coffee sector; and through engaging with the public and media. 

 <ins> **A\) Industry Collaborations**</ins> 

 Morris has worked with international partners across the coffee industry on bespoke projects that draw upon his research expertise. Three such collaborations are presented below. 

 **1. Nestle\-Nespresso, Lausanne, Switzerland** 

 Nestle\-Nespresso is the world’s largest producer of coffee capsule products. Morris has worked on four key projects with Nespresso supporting the company’s product range development and marketing, staff education and development, and corporate social responsibility activities. His work with Nespresso was recognised by *Times Higher Education* awards in 2018 when he was a finalist in the ‘Most Innovative Contribution to Business\-University Collaboration’ category. 

 Morris’s collaboration with Nespresso began in 2017 when he wrote a chapter for an industry\-defining volume funded by the company, *The Craft and Science of Coffee*. This chapter, ‘We Consumers – Tastes, Rituals and Waves’ \[ **3.5**\], “ *provides a broader social and human perspective to why we, as an industry, are where we are today*,” according to Nespresso’s Regulatory and Scientific Affairs Manager who edited the book. All profits from the volume \($35,000 to date\) are invested in the Nespresso AAA Farmer Future Program, the first ever retirement savings fund for Colombian coffee farmers \[ **5.1**\]. 

 Morris then collaborated with educational consultants at Nespresso to create an e\-learning module on Coffee History for the company’s university\-accredited diploma course in Coffee Excellence, which was launched in June 2018. The module covered the five eras of coffee history identified by Morris in *Coffee. A Global History* alongside material on the importance of rituals and routines developed in \[ **3.5**\]. A first cohort of 30 Nespresso employees from 15 countries graduated in 2019, with a second cohort starting in 2020. The Head of Coffee at Nespresso reports that the module: “ *is of great value to the students as it helps them to better understand the coffee industry today, and the role that Nespresso plays in it. When speaking to consumers or media, it is always important to place yourself in a bigger context*” \[ **5.1**\]. 

 In 2018, Morris worked with Nespresso on their new ‘Ispirazione Italia’ range. He presented at a vision workshop drawing directly on his research into the history of Italian coffee to offer insights into the evolution of espresso in Italy, differences in regional tastes and cultures, and the particular role of cities in Italian coffee history. The range was launched in January 2020. A Senior Coffee Marketing Manager at Nespresso reports that “ *Professor Morris helped Nespresso to create a coherent, credible and substantiated new segment storytelling, aiming at discovering the Italianess of the Nespresso blends*” \[ **5.1**\]. 

 In 2019, Morris joined an internal working group at Nespresso on the development of a new range of capsules, World Explorations, inspired by different coffee drinking cultures around the world. Drawing directly upon his research into global coffee history, Morris helped to align blend characteristics with the traditional taste preferences of consumer communities and ensure that the historical rationale provided for creating these linkages would be authentic. Nespresso report that Morris’s work: supported the creation of the marketing story and communications for the global launch; provides the basis of FAQs for consumers; is provided to all Nespresso markets for regulatory purposes \(e.g. to show compliance with consumer laws against misleading advertisement\). A Senior Marketing Manager Coffee at Nespresso said: “ *Professor Morris helped us to find the authentic coffee rituals and tastes, and the way they* *should be credibly communicated, which significantly impacted the way the range was structured and positioned for the final consumer*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 **2. Gruppo Cimbali, Milan, Italy / Mulmar Foodservice Solutions, Hatfield, UK** 

 Gruppo Cimbali is the largest manufacturer of commercial espresso machines in Italy, including the historic FAEMA brand. Mulmar Foodservice Solutions are the exclusive importers of FAEMA machines into the UK. Morris’s collaboration with Mulmar originally began when he interviewed the company as part of his research. Then in 2014, Mulmar commissioned the Heritage for Business unit at UH to create a business\-to\-business marketing video \[ **5.2**\] that would use the company’s heritage and history to generate new commercial opportunity \[ **5.3**\]. Morris drew upon his *Cappuccino Conquests* research to situate the company’s history within that of Anglo\-Italian enterprises in the UK and the specialty coffee revolution. He directed the work of a photo\-researcher, wrote the storyboard, briefed the video production company and was interviewed for the film. The video launched at the London Coffee Festival in 2015. It is embedded into the company web homepage and Mulmar report that clients have often viewed it before contacting them, and through it have gained an appreciation of the company’s role in the specialty coffee revolution in the UK. They also use it for induction and training of new staff to demonstrate the values of the company \[ **5.3**\]. 

 Through his involvement with Mulmar, Morris began work with their Italian partners, Gruppo Cimbali. In 2016, the company released their new FAEMA E\-71 espresso machine. The name was chosen by the company to reflect their heritage machine, the E\-61; Morris’s research had previously shown that it was the E61 that first established the brewing parameters now associated with the so\-called ‘traditional Italian espresso’ in 1961 and facilitated the creation of the modern Italian coffee bar format with its distinctive consumption culture. Mulmar and Gruppo Cimbali worked with Morris on an integrated marketing strategy for the launch of the E71 which would leverage FAEMA’s heritage. Morris undertook further research in the company archives in Milan, creating a set of presentations with accompanying written materials illustrating the evolution of the machine and its legacy, dubbing it ‘ *The Coffee Machine that Changed the World’*, a name that has stuck. These were delivered at events targeting influencers in the coffee community, including masterclasses at the London Coffee Festival. Press packs containing materials written by Morris were distributed, and trade media channels published articles drawing upon these \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **3. Ecocafe, Lausanne, Switzerland** 

 In 2019, Morris was asked by Swiss coffee roaster and café operator Ecocafe to assist with their regulatory submission relating to a new product, Ice Cascara, a beverage made from the dried coffee cherry husk. Swiss food regulations required Ecocafe to demonstrate that cascara had been consumed in large quantity in at least one non\-EU country prior to 1997. Morris supplied Ecocafe with an expert letter documenting the consumption of similar beverages in Yemen from at least 1558, including citations from original sources, drawing on his research into the origins of coffee beverages. The letter formed part of the documentation presented to the Swiss regulatory authorities who licensed the product in 2020. Ecocafe have since applied to the European Food Standards Authority to market Ice Cascara in the EU using a dossier containing Morris’s letter \[ **5.4**\]. 

 <ins> **B\) Education and engagement across the coffee sector**</ins> 

 Morris has achieved further impact as an educator and influencer throughout the coffee sector. He engages with all sections of the coffee industry, making interventions drawing on his research from the origins of coffee drinking through to historical reflections on the current coffee price crisis and sustainability issues. 

 Morris regularly contributes to industry events. Examples include: 

-  Advising the Specialty Coffee Association \(SCA **\)**, a global trade association, on an installation for HOST Milan 2017 \(Europe’s largest hospitality trade show\), including presenting seminars at the event, and authoring the accompanying brochure. 

-  Featured panellist at the inaugural meeting of the Allegra Coffee Leader Network \(ACLN **\)** in 2018, a gathering of industry leaders to discuss trends in British coffee culture over the last 20 years. 

-  Presentations at international industry conferences such as the International Coffee Organisation Annual Conference 2018 \[ **5.5**\]. 

 Morris makes frequent appearances across all forms of the coffee media from print to podcasts. He has published opinion pieces in key industry journals such as *Coffee and Cocoa International*; *Fifth Wave*, and *Café Life*. \[ **5.5**\]. He has appeared in six episodes of *The Coffee Podcast*, which have been downloaded a total of 70,000 times. The podcast’s host, Jesse Hartman, reports that Morris “ *poetically and systematically teaches us something new about coffee with every conversation. … My listeners and I gain a new understanding of what history is, how to understand it, and where coffee fits*” \[ **5.6**\]. Ross Hindle, Managing Editor of *Perfect Daily Grind*, states that "" *Working with Jonathan brings exceptional value to the content we write. …Alongside using his existing published work to support research for articles on Perfect Daily Grind, we also interview him regularly for high\-level thought leadership feature pieces … which together boast more than 80,000 page views*” \[ **5.7**\]. 

 Morris’s work is featured in industry educational materials produced by Barista Hustle, an online training company in Australia whose courses have been accessed by over 1 million users worldwide. He is cited in six modules across four different courses. His research also forms the centre of two of the five elements in *The Value of Coffee*, a free taster online module offered by the Open University for which he was also interviewed; the course had 8,950 visitors in its first 2 years \(2017\-2019\) \[ **5.8**\]. 

 <ins> **C\) Public reach and media</ins>** 

 Morris is often called upon by media outlets to provide coffee history\-related comment and content. He appeared in a December 2019 episode of BBC Radio 4s *In Our Time* on coffee history *,* with c.2,500,000 radio listeners and c.800,000 podcast listeners that month alone. His episode of *In Our Time* was streamed more than any other episode in 2020 \[ **5.9**\]. He participated in a report on Italian espresso on *The Current*, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s top current event radio show \(4,000,000\+ listeners\), in December 2019 \[ **5.10**\]. In 2016 he appeared in, and provided script advice for, a 1\-hour PBS documentary *Coffee: The Drink that Changed America* which was widely shown throughout the United States \[ **5.11**\]. In January 2017 BBC TV and Radio utilised Morris as the expert commentator on research they had undertaken on the changing face of the high street. He recorded a television interview screened on BBC 1 and gave live interviews to Radio London and 10 other BBC local radio outlets. Coverage on other channels and print media has included *The Independent*, the *Sun, The Sunday Times, Huffington Post* and the *Guardian* \[ **5.12**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Stirling research underpinned the successful implementation of the new smoke\-free policy in Scottish prisons through effective partnership\-working with the Scottish Prison Service \(SPS\). We facilitated the success of the new policy by feeding back the views of those in custody \(hereafter ‘prisoners’\), prison staff, and providers/users of smoking cessation services throughout the preparation period for its successful introduction. Immediate improvements in prison air quality evidence the successful implementation of the policy, and the end of the exceptional circumstance of staff exposed to second\-hand smoke, leading to health improvements for prisoners and staff \(e.g. reduction in medications for respiratory\-related illness\). Benefits will accrue to the \~4,500 staff employed by SPS and over 8,000 people in their care each year. Long\-term analyses show total costs were lower with the smoke\-free policy compared to without for prisoners \(GBP32,848 versus GBP33,749\) and staff \(GBP10,462 versus GBP11,183\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prison smoking bans are challenging because smoking is culturally embedded in prison life, where tobacco serves many functions, e.g. as a currency, stress reliever, or symbol of freedom in a group with limited privileges. Concerns about disruption or unrest dominate media coverage of prison smoking bans. Bans were recently introduced in England and Wales, following countries including Canada and New Zealand, but no country to date had conducted pre\- and post\-ban evaluations. The method by which Scotland implemented its prison smoking ban is novel: it was informed by robust evidence from the Tobacco in Prisons study \(TIPs\) \(and the allied ‘E\-cigarettes in prisons’ study\) \( **R1\-R5**\) on second\-hand smoke \(SHS\) levels and the views of prisoners and prison staff before, during and after the development and implementation of the policy. This is important because the voices of the most directly affected \(prisoners, prison staff\) have been largely absent, previously limiting learning between countries. 

 **Extent of the problem** 

 In Scotland, \~73% of prisoners in 2015\-18 smoked; a level not seen in the general population since the 1950s, and far higher than the national average \(\~20%\). High prisoner smoking rates have been described as a pernicious public health problem, often overlooked in tobacco control policy. Smoking in prisons affects a vulnerable population, increasing health risks for prisoners and prison staff exposed to SHS at work \(illegal since 2006/7 in most UK workplaces\), and places a burden on health services. SHS is estimated to increase lung cancer risk by 25% \(www.nhs.uk/smokefree/why\-quit/secondhand\-smoke\#\). 

 **The Tobacco in Prisons \(TIPs\) study \(PI Hunt\) comprises three phases:** 

-  **Phase 1**: Before any smoke\-free prison policy was formulated in Scotland; **Phase 2**: From announcement to implementation of policy; **Phase 3**: Post\-implementation evaluation. 

 **Hunt** and **Semple** led Phase 1 prior to moving to Stirling from the Universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen. Stirling impact is only claimed for Phase 2 \(evidenced by Phase 3\), although Phase 1 research defined the context. Surveys and staff focus groups in all 15 Scottish prisons in Phase 1 highlighted considerable staff concern about SHS exposure at work and the challenges of implementing or enforcing tobacco bans in prisons. Our allied study of e\-cigarettes in prisons was conducted in parallel with TIPs in Phases 2 and 3. 

 **Phase 2: Planning for smoke\-free policy** 

 Staff were initially more positive than prisoners about increased smoking restrictions \(74% staff and 22% prisoners agreed bans were a ‘good idea’\), although staff expressed concerns about the need for appropriate measures, resources and support, adequate lead\-in time, and effective communication in preparation for a ban. Prisoner views were more favourable if e\-cigarettes might be introduced. Survey data from prisoners \(n=2512\) and staff \(n=1271\), and 17 focus groups \(n=132 staff\), in all prisons identified factors and measures that key groups considered critical for successful implementation, including effective communication and enhanced training and support \( **R1**\). The data highlighted a potential role for introducing e\-cigarettes to take account of more vulnerable smokers’ needs in the lead up to a smoking ban. Staff focus groups realised a need for information on the balance of evidence on e\-cigarettes for reducing smoking harms, and concerns and uncertainties about potential e\-cigarette harms and security risks in prisons \( **R2**\). Opposition to smoke\-free policy centred on concerns about fairness and apprehension about adverse impacts. However, analysis of in\-depth interviews with 77 prisoners confirmed that communication about the impending implementation was effective, resulting in widespread awareness, and that some prisoners anticipated positive benefits of the policy for themselves, other prisoners, and prison staff \( **R3**\). Data collected soon after rechargeable e\-cigarettes \(hereafter ‘vapes’\) were introduced a few weeks before the implementation of smoke\-free rules, showed widespread experimentation with vapes in preparation for the removal of tobacco. Analysis of in\-depth interviews with prisoners \(n=28\) provided evidence that prisoners felt listened to and more confident they would be able to cope with enforced abstinence from tobacco \( **R4**\) and three repeat cross\-sectional surveys with staff \(n=1271, n=1494, n=757\) and with prisoners \(n=2125, n=1673, n=1248\) showed strong support for the decision to make e\-cigarettes available in the lead up to the smoking ban \( **R5**\). 

 The smoking ban was successfully implemented in November 2018, without major incident, despite fears about significant disruption \( **R1**, **R5**\) expressed earlier by both staff and prisoners.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Following TIPs Phase 1 research on SHS levels in prisons, the SPS announced \(July 2017\) it would implement a complete smoking ban in all its prisons from November 2018. Our research conducted and fed back in Phase 2 \( **R1\-R5**\) directly underpinned the successful implementation of the ban. Phase 3 evidenced its success, including: objectively\-measured reductions in SHS in the week of implementation \( **S1**\) and 6 months later \( **S2**\); survey and qualitative data documenting the experiences of staff and prisoners; improved outcomes \(e.g. medications dispensed for prisoners; staff sickness absence rates\); and cost\-effectiveness in the short\- and long\-term \( **S3**\). 

##  Impact 1: Informing successful SPS planning and communications 

 Knowledge exchange with stakeholders is at the core of TIPs. Hunt and Brown were active members \(periodic input also from Semple, Eadie, Bauld\) of the SPS Smoke Free Prisons Stakeholder Advisory Group \(SAG, formed after policy announcement\) alongside senior SPS staff and representatives from unions, NHS, and Scottish Government. **TIPs findings were rapidly and directly incorporated into SPS planning and communications via their reporting at monthly SAG meetings**. Specifically, TIPs findings fed into SPS’ communications strategy about smoke\-free prisons, identifying some issues to target and providing reassurance that important messages were being successfully **communicated to key groups. Ongoing communication of early findings enabled SPS to be more “agile” and to “respond quicker”** \( **S4**\) and **successfully**. As the SPS lead for implementation of the smoke\-free prison project stated: 

 “The fact that you \[TIPs team\] were doing… very informed and robust focus groups and questionnaires allowed us to check whether our message was hitting home… Having you as part of our SAG meetings was really important. And you feeding back on some of the research you’d been doing was really helpful for us because that gave us a\[n\]… independent check. People actually were getting the message… it was absolutely essential to this project.” \( **S5**\) 

 Our independent research evidence was seen by operational and non\-operational staff as a crucial arm of the planning for smoke\-free implementation. Involving staff and prisoners in the research made a significant contribution to **changing attitudes towards the policy** and in **influencing staff and prisoners to anticipate the change more positively**. Our research findings helped them to take greater ownership and invest more fully in this major and challenging policy change: 

 “If we hadn’t communicated what we were trying to do, I don’t think we’d have got on very far… not just with individuals in custody, with all the staff group. And I think reassuringly for them, an independent channel, an objective channel… you were working with us but not for us...\[,\] that was really good and gave staff a level of assurance that you were independent and they would be heard. ... \[W\]hat our comms strategy developed into as we went through the process was influenced by the \[research\]… where the researchers were getting a chance to feedback initial findings. It allowed us to act quickly to address some of these issues.” \( **S5**\) 

 This, in turn, was instrumental in **demonstrating greater acceptance than expected to the removal of tobacco amongst some prisoners and** **reducing resistance to the policy’s implementation amongst other prisoners and staff.** As the SPS Communication Strategy & Operational Liaison stated: 

 “I think the unexpected things for me was the willingness of people in custody to talk about the impact of taking tobacco off them…\[,\] all the research showed that tobacco was important, it’s important status\-wise,… culturally,… as currency. … \[I\]t reinforced we’re doing this for the right reason. ... We’re not doing it ‘cause it’s politically correct. ... We’re doing it because people in our care, their health will improve.. \[T\]he majority of it reinforced what we suspected. But it moved from hearsay… to physical fact and evidence. ... It allowed you to challenge negative views and the doubters. ‘This’ll never work. Prisoners will never accept this’. Well actually they will. ... That was one of the things I think was really encouraging, the amount of people saying, ‘I’ll maybe see this as an opportunity of quitting altogether’. And I think that actually really prepared the NHS for the number of people that were going to impact on their services. So again, that factual bit of evidence had a real practical outcome for one of our partners within the project, ‘We need to scale up or we’re never going to meet demand.’” \( **S4**\) 

 Among the measures adopted by the SPS prior to implementation were the introduction of e\-cigarettes and the adoption of ‘diversionary activity’ programmes. 

 **Impact 2: Informing world\-first vaping guidelines** 

 Phase 2 interviews conducted with staff and prisoners after rechargeable vaping devices and e\-liquids became available for purchase in prisons shortly before tobacco sales ceased, allowed a unique insight into how e\-cigarettes can support \(or disrupt\) initiatives to improve staff and prisoner health. Some prisoners had exceeded their own expectations in using e\-cigarettes to cut down or stop smoking; others reported little utility from vaping at this early stage. Participants articulated symbolic and practical benefits of e\-cigarettes in the transition to smoke\-free prisons but highlighted potential issues related to inappropriate use, product choice, affordability, safety, and long\-term use of e\-cigarettes. These results helped to shape NHS responses, and specifically the Guidance launched in January 2020 on supporting people in custody who wish to cut down or quit vaping \( **S6**\). Also, as part of TIPs, Eadie, Brown, Hunt, Purves, and Bauld conducted and analysed interviews with providers of NHS smoking cessation programmes in all Scottish prisons, and people using, or wanting to use, these services in six case\-study prisons. TIPs also provided independent evidence on successes, challenges, and gaps in provision of cessation support from the perspective of service providers and users in the lead up to smoke\-free implementation to the SPS SAG and NHS colleagues designing and providing Quit Your Way Prisons pathways to support prisoners to abstain from or quit smoking. 

 **Impact 3: TIPs identified factors in making smoke\-free prisons implementable** 

 Phase 2 research identified key factors for the successful implementation of a complete tobacco ban within prisons, including: maintaining an open dialogue with staff and prisoners in the lead\-up to implementation; ensuring decisions on the support in place prior to the ban were based on evidence; and broad and early communication of the policy, e.g. to ensure new prisoners did not only learn of the smoking ban on arrival. **The mixed\-methods design provided** **evidence which Public Health Scotland and Scottish Government found convincing and engaging, allowing the smoke\-free policy to achieve the aims it had**. As someone from Health Scotland indicated: 

 “One of the things that is key, is a great study design. ... \[T\]here is the power of the stories and… of numbers and I think you need to have both… to really get ministers’ and civil servants’ attention… that’s what TIPs had. It had both the numbers which had come from the exposure data, \[and\] the story of what that means in terms of the perspective of staff. ... The narrative was so strong and I think that’s why it’s had this huge impact \[i.e. success of policy\]... it is really harnessing the power of stories and numbers together that you really get impact.” \( **S7**\) 

 The Head of Tobacco Control in the Scottish Government identified the **TIPs findings as a catalyst for the smooth, successful change to smoke\-free prisons**: 

 “I think what TIPs brought us was the catalyst for a definitive time for the change... without TIPs I think we still wouldn’t have had smoke\-free prisons right now... and the transition certainly would not have been so smooth and the implementation would not have been as smooth. ... \[H\]aving TIPs as the evidence was crucial, not just in terms of the pace, but actually to give us the confidence and the assurance that this was a good decision and it would very likely have a very positive impact. ... I think the Phase two was as important as the Phase one. The Phase one gets us an evidence base for making decisions. The Phase two is much more focused on how the actual policy change would be made. ... \[I\]t’s one of the rare brilliant times where you can see the research smoothing the way for the policy.” \( **S8**\) 

 Moreover, TIPs helped to bring together all major stakeholders: 

 “The research had a direct influence on providing evidence that persuaded NHS Public Health, local NHS service providers, health promotion/improvement organisations, and prison management and administration to work together in partnership to make the smoke\-free transition a success. Key stakeholders stressed that the SPS could not have implemented the policy alone, and that ‘working in partnership was absolutely essential’ to the success of the smoke\-free policy, linking its effectiveness directly to the evidence provided by this research.” \( **S8**\) 

 **Impact 4: Creating a successful partnership model for policy implementation** 

 The TIPs project provides **a model of ‘best practice’ for partnership working in the development and implementation of challenging policy**, from SPS, Government and health service perspectives. The SPS lead for implementation of the smoke\-free prison project stated: 

 “\[E\]verybody involved in the project, I think, deems it a success and an absolute best\-practice model of working in partnership with yourselves and the TIPs project, but also with the NHS, with our own trade union side, and with those across the prison service. It’s worked really, really well and made a tremendous difference to people’s lives. ... Because the research was so influential in developing these successful working partnerships, it had a direct influence on shifting the culture of practice in the SPS for the benefits of prisoners and staff alike.” \( **S5**\) 

 Additionally, this partnership has **built capacity, knowledge, and expertise** for future cross\-agency partnerships to extend health improvement in prisons in other ways: 

 “Now because we’ve made those partnership connects with health boards and probably from both sides, we can actually work together pretty well. There’s a specific relationship with NHS primary care, who provide a service to prisons and deal with the prisoners every day. ... But the health improvement side of it I think has been lacking historically with some notable exceptions. But the smoke\-free prisons partnership working has certainly got that together in a much more proactive way. ... It’s raised the profile of what we can do working together, where that wasn’t there before.” \( **S5**\) 

 TIPS also: *“*engendered a real enthusiasm for further change in other fields\[,\]… the partnership aspect of TIPs and the enthusiasm with all parties to it, the enthusiasm people had for it, has been very helpful in a lot of wider policies as well. So things you wouldn’t necessarily get credit for” \( **S8**\). The collaborative model of policy implementation that TIPs has created is now also being show\-cased in World Health Organisation training as an example of best practice in the area of smoke\-free prisons. 

 **Impact 5: Successful implementation has led to improved health** 

 Air quality measurements conducted in TIPs Phase 3 in the week of smoke\-free implementation \(30<sup>th</sup> November 2018\) provided world\-first evidence of an immediate reduction in SHS. There was an average reduction of 81% post\-implementation in comparison with 2016 measurements across all prisons \( **S1**\). Measurements in May 2019 show that this reduction has been sustained or improved upon, with very little objective evidence of violations of the ban \( **S2**\). 

 Further benefit impacts arising from the ban include reduction in prescriptions issued to treat acute respiratory symptoms in people in custody and cost\-effectiveness of the policy \( **S3**\). Long\-term analyses showed total costs were lower with the smoke\-free policy compared to without for people in custody \(GBP32,848 versus GBP33,749\) and staff \(GBP10,462 versus GBP11,183\). At the GBP20,000 UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence willingness\-to\-pay threshold, the smoke\-free policy for both groups would be considered highly cost\-effective.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Birmingham has had **global impact on clinical care for patients with advanced ovarian cancer**. The CHORUS trial showed significantly reduced patient morbidity and hospital stay, without compromising survival, by administering chemotherapy before surgery rather than the conventional treatment, where chemotherapy follows surgery. 

 The specific impacts are: 

1.  **Improved patient health outcomes**, in particular, a reduction of treatment\-related morbidity, better survival rates for patients with advanced disease and improved quality of life. 

1.  **Global changes to national clinical guidelines and clinical practice**; the use of pre\-surgery chemotherapy is now routine practice following guideline changes in the UK, USA, Spain, France, Poland, Singapore and Korea. 

1.  **The cost of treatment has reduced**, such that in the USA alone the annual saving is estimated to be $142 million. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Approximately 300,000 women worldwide develop ovarian cancer annually, including 7,500 in the UK, where it is estimated that numbers will increase to >10,000 over the next decade. 75% of patients present with advanced disease, defined as stage 3 or 4 \(the disease is classified into four stages according to the size and spread of the tumour\), and these women, who are the focus of this work, have a five\-year survival rate of just 30% \(CRUK 2017\). 

 For over 50 years, the standard intervention was primary surgery, which aimed to remove as much of the tumour as possible, followed by cytotoxic \(chemo\) therapy. Clearance of macroscopic tumour is associated with better survival, however about 50–60% of patients will have disease left behind after primary surgery. The concept of administering non\-surgical interventions *before* definitive surgery had been explored in other cancers on the basis that administering chemotherapy first increased the likelihood of clearing all cancer at surgery. However, this approach required evaluation in advanced ovarian cancer. 

 CHORUS was a multi\-centre randomised trial, involving 67 centres across the UK and New Zealand, conducted to compare the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy \(NACT\) given prior to surgery with conventional treatment in which surgery precedes chemotherapy. Professor Kehoe \(Senior Lecturer and subsequently chair in Gynaecological Cancer University of Birmingham \(UoB\) 1997–2021\) developed the CHORUS trial with the UK Medical Research Council, identified recruitment centres and informed the national community about the trial in a series of national meetings \(1999–2002\). At the same time, he developed collaborations with the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer \(EORTC\) to assess NACT usage in Europe, ensuring that data from the UK and European studies could be amalgamated to provide definitive international evidence of the efficacy of NACT in advanced ovarian cancer. 

 Between March 2004 and September 2010, 552 women with suspected stage 3 or 4 ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to treatment. Of 550 eligible women, 276 were assigned to primary surgery followed by six cycles of chemotherapy and 274 to three cycles of primary chemotherapy, then surgery and three more cycles of completion chemotherapy. 

 Patients were followed up until 2012 when analysis of the CHORUS outcomes started, leading to an oral presentation in 2013 at **ASCO \(American Society of Clinical Oncology\)** and a subsequent **Lancet** publication in 2015 \(R1\) reporting the results from the CHORUS trial. 

 Overall survival with NACT was equal to conventional therapy but there was a significant reduction in a\) **severe treatment\-related side\-effects** \(48% primary surgery Group to 40% NACT Group\); b\) **post\-surgical complications** \(24% to 14%\) and c\) **early post\-surgical deaths** \(5.6% to 0.5%\) along with shortened **post\-operative hospital inpatient stay \(92% of NACT discharged within 14 days of surgery vs 80% in primary surgery arm\)**. 

 In 2016, Professor Kehoe was **invited to ASCO to present data concerning patients’** **quality of life \(QOL\)** assessment in the CHORUS study. This showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery was associated with significantly improved QOL over the 6 months of treatment \(R2\). 

 **Furthermore, amalgamation of the results of CHORUS and EORTC** for a per\-patient analysis was published in Lancet Oncology in 2018 \(R3\), reporting for the first time that **in stage 4 disease a statistically significant improvement in progression\-free and overall survival was seen with NACT when compared with conventional therapy**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The CHORUS trial has fundamentally transformed the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer globally, improving patient survival and quality of life, whilst reducing healthcare\-related costs. 

1.  **Improving patient health outcomes as a result of change in practice worldwide** 

 Significant **patient benefits** are demonstrated by the findings that NACT **improves post\-surgical mortality and morbidity leading to quicker discharge rates**. 

 Based on the results of the CHORUS trial, women with advanced stage 3 or 4 ovarian cancer are receiving NACT benefit from: 

 \- **reduced post\-surgical mortality** \(<1% in NACT vs 6% post surgery group\); 

 \- **a reduction of grade 3 and 4 post\-surgical morbidities** \(including haemorrhage, the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event, which reduced from 6% to 3%\); 

 \- **they are more likely to be discharged** **within 14 days** from operation \(93% compared with only 80% in the primary\-surgery group\) \(R1\); and 

 \- **they show improved survival for patients with stage 4 disease** \(R3\). 

 These improved patient outcomes are evidenced in a 2018 US study \(S1\) using the National Cancer Database records. This found that adoption of NACT by cancer centres resulted in a **19% reduction in mortality** within three years after diagnosis. In contrast, no improvement in mortality was observed in Centres that did not adopt the NACT protocol. Rapidly adopting centres also demonstrated a **43% reduction in 90\-day surgical mortality** during this period compared to 14% in the control centres \(p<0.001\). These benefits to patients are now being realised through worldwide change in practice informed by CHORUS. 

 Evidence of patient benefit and improved outcomes is also attested to by the chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, who stated in 2015 that the CHORUS trial “is a great example of how research can help us to plan the best care for people with cancer. Thanks to this study we can say that having chemotherapy first makes the surgery safer, the stay in hospital shorter and women’s quality of life better. These are important results that will make a big difference to many women in the future” \(S2\). 

1.  **National and International guidelines for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer and clinical practices have changed as a result of CHORUS** 

 **Clinical guidelines have changed** such that NACT is **recommended as the preferred treatment strategy for advanced ovarian cancer**. Our work \(R1–R3\) led directly to **changes in national clinical guidelines** around the world including in the UK, USA, Spain, France, Poland, Singapore and Korea \(S3\). This change in guidelines has translated to changes in clinical practice across the world for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. 

 Citing the CHORUS study \(R1, 2015\) as the evidence, the following **national clinical guidelines changed** to incorporate NACT as **the preferred** treatment strategy for advanced ovarian cancer: 

-  The **Polish** Society of Oncological Gynaecology: recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer 2015 \(S3\); 

-  **Singapore** Cancer Network \(SCAN\) Guidelines for Front\-Line Systemic Therapy of Newly Diagnosed Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer \(2015\) \(S3\); 

-  The **American** Society of Clinical Oncology and the Society of Gynecological Oncologists 2016 \(S3\); 

-  Sociedad **Espanola** de Oncologia Medica \(SEOM\): Clinical Guidelines in ovarian cancer \(2016\) in Spain \(S3\); 

-  The **British** Gynaecological Cancer Society guidelines \(2017\) \(S3\); 

-  Practice guidelines for management of ovarian cancer in **Korea** 2018 \(S3\); 

-  **French** national college of obstetricians and gynaecologists Guidelines in oncology \(2019\) \(S3\). 

 **Clinical practice has changed for patients with advanced ovarian cancer**, such that they now routinely have chemotherapy as the preferred first line treatment. That this is the case is attested to by the ASCO Senior Vice President of Clinical Affairs and National Director for Medical Oncology at Cancer Treatment Centres of America in Philadelphia, who stated that, “without question CHORUS should have a major Impact on community oncology practice” \(S4\). 

 A seismic change in clinical practice is illustrated by **increased usage of** **NACT since 2013–2015**. NACT was used in England in only 21.4% of cases between 2013–2015 \(S5\). In November 2020, the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service released an audit on over 20,000 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer and treated in England during 2016–2018. Of 7,157 women with a histological diagnosis of a serous cancer, 71% were treated with NACT, representing 57% of women with stage 2/3 disease and 87% of those with stage 4 disease \(S6\). 

1.  **The cost of treatment for advanced ovarian cancer has reduced** 

 The CHORUS study reported that 92% of women treated with the NACT protocol were discharged within 14 days after surgery compared with only 74% in the primary surgery arm, providing evidence of economic savings \(R1\). This was corroborated by a large economic analysis by Cole *et al*. \(S7, 2018\) which found that, compared with primary surgery, **NACT was associated with a potential $142 million in cost savings across the USA alone**. Comparable relative cost saving would be expected within the NHS setting.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In the last 20 years, improving support for the victims of crime has become central to national criminal justice policy. Through the application of his research on the victims of crime and their support by criminal justice agencies, Professor Hall has had substantial and lasting impacts on police operational practice in Lincolnshire and the wider region, including: 

-  Changes in police policy and practice relating to ethical issues; 

-  Enabling evidence\-based decision making by Lincolnshire’s Police and Crime  Commissioner \(PCC\); and, 

-  Improving the integrity of crime reporting.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Hall has been actively researching criminal justice, victimisation and police policy for over 15 years, producing a body of work recognised internationally for shaping our understanding of victims’ experiences of criminal justice. In recognition of his contribution to the field of criminology, Hall received the bi\-annual Denis Szabo Award from the Centre International Criminologie Comparée, Université de Montréal \( [https://bit.ly/3c7BpEm](https://bit.ly/3c7BpEm)\).  Hall’s research, conducted at Lincoln \( **3.1\-3.5**\), has drawn upon a variety of empirical approaches and ethical positions, notably virtue and common good approaches to justice, with significant implications for how victims of crime experience justice as a concept within the criminal justice system \( **3.1,** **3.2**\). Three aspects of his research have been critical to informing impact during the REF period. First, Hall has provided a conceptual and empirically tested account of how victim support needs should be considered in the criminal justice system.  Second, he has shown how procedural safeguards can protect victims. Third, in combining these conceptual and procedural insights, he exposed gaps and opportunities for improvement in the practical delivery of victim support services. 

1.  *Understanding victim support needs* 

 Hall has conducted extensive research into understanding the political, social and cultural contexts of victimisation and victim policy \( **3.1**\). He has demonstrated how political, social and cultural factors interact with criminal justice policy, providing key insights for policy makers and practitioners as to how policy ideas translate into practice within the criminal justice system \( **3.1**\). There is a body of literature adopting a victim\-centric approach that provides insights from ‘cultural victimology’, ‘victim governance’, and ‘victim in law/criminal justice, this mainly takes discrete sociological \(e.g. Rock 2004\), political \(Garland 2001\) or legal \(Ashworth 2000\) perspectives. Hall’s research \( **3.1**\) combines these approaches to explain their implications for the policy of victim support, and to do so from a socio\-legal perspective that examines the end\-to\-end process of victim policy from development to implementation. He uses real cases studies on the provision of victim support by police forces to test and explain the conceptual findings. Hall combines different strands of research to establish how public policy on victim support has increasingly devolved responsibility for victim support away from the state to immediate family and local support groups, and that in line with neo\-liberal values, some responsibility for the burden of supporting victims has been placed onto offenders \( **3.1**, chap 2\). This increases the vulnerability of victims, leaving them less able to cope with crime and recover from harm \( **3.3**\). Hall gathered data on how PCCs have commissioned victim support services and evaluated the way PCCs have assessed victim needs. This leads Hall to conclude that criminal justice agencies need to consider more carefully how they interact with victims of crime to ensure that they meet victims’ actual support needs. This draws upon wider sociological insights about the nature of victimisation rather than limited perspectives such as social standing or ‘labelling’ of victims. By understanding the pivotal role that local criminal justice agencies \(e.g. PCCs\) play in the provision and delivery of victim support services, and their responsibility for and power over victims, Hall shows that providers can make more considered decisions on the provision of services in light an awareness of the wider cultural and political situation of victims \( **3.1** chaps 3 and 7\). Expanding on a deeper understanding of the nature of the victim, Hall has foregrounded less ‘visible’ victims and their interaction with criminal justice agencies, including older\-age victims of crime \( **3.2**\) and a wide body of work on victims of environmental harm \(e.g. **3.5**\), making recommendations on support needs of a wider range of different types of victim of crime. 

1.  *Procedural safeguards* 

 Building on this earlier work, Hall has recently focused attention on victim interactions with police \( **3.4**\) and courts at both a national and international level \( **3.1**\) establishing victims’ basic needs/desires from such agencies as being threefold: procedural justice, respect, and support. This specifically included understanding the impacts of compensation, restitution and restorative justice mechanisms as modes of redressing the victims of crime \( **3.1** chap 5\). Specifically, Hall advanced the importance of securing these processes in policy and practice as a means of improving the confidence and capacity of victims to engage with criminal justice proceedings. This research dovetails with Hall’s other research on data gap analysis in crime reporting \( **3.6**\).  Although focused on environmental crime, his approach shows that effective and tailored crime policy response measures cannot be developed in the absence of robust data recording and sharing. 

1.  *Capacity\-building for Victim Support* 

 Hall has also focused attention on the provision of victim services through the UK government’s new local commissioning scheme, whereby the role of distributing government monies for victim support has been delegated to local police and crime commissioners. Hall produced one of the first detailed studies into the first round of PCCs’ commissioning of these services \( **3.3**\) and the interaction between such services and victims’ wider experiences with the rest of the criminal justice process \( **3.1**\). This revealed shortcomings in the existing system from a victim perspective and, notably, an absence of provision and support for victims of domestic abuse. Hall also recommended the use of more robust data collection measures on victims and victimisation in local areas in order to properly target the funding to meet local victims’ needs \( **3.1**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The University of Lincoln has developed close working relationships with key policing bodies which enabled research\-driven improvements in police behaviours in supporting victims of crime and more broadly in driving evidence\-based decision\-making within the police and the Police and Crime Commissioner’s \(PCCs\) Office. As a result of his internationally recognised expertise on the impact of crime on victims, Hall has been invited to participate in a number of police led initiatives designed to improve victim services through evidence informed policy change.  Since 2014, Hall has been Lincoln University’s lead on the East Midlands Police Academic Collaboration \(EMPAC\), a cooperative network between five police forces \(Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire; comprising 8,239 officers and staff\), respective PCCs and University researchers. In October 2015, Hall was invited onto Lincolnshire Police’s Ethics Panel. EMPAC guides policy development matters that the police consider to be ethically contentious. Opportunities to influence policy have been reinforced through regular engagement with and expert briefings to the PCCs in Lincolnshire and the East Midlands. Through these collaborations Hall’s research has had the following impacts: 

1.  *Changes in police policy and practice relating to ethical issues* 

 Lincolnshire Police force have changed their approach to victim support in response to insights and advice drawn from Hall’s research. Between 2015 and 2020, Hall utilised his research on the nature of victimisation \(3.1\) and procedural good practice \(3.4\) to inform and influence the deliberations and outcomes of all discussions conducted by Lincolnshire Police’s Ethics Panel.  This resulted in the development of more ethically informed and evidence\-based approaches by Lincolnshire Police that was sensitive to victim needs and perceptions of bias or unfairness in the conduct of crime investigations. The Independent Chair of the Lincolnshire Police Ethics Panel confirms that Hall has made a ‘ *very substantial’* difference to how the Panel operates, using his practice orientated research to make the Panel proceedings ‘ *far more relevant to society in general.’* \( **5.1\)** For example, Hall’s work on procedural justice \(3.4\) was utilised in a debate around the force’s response to ‘concerns’ around the prevalence of Freemasonry within the police. This flagged up the risks arising from a lack of transparency \(real or perceived\) and concerns by the police about how this might be seen to undermine a commitment of police to act towards victims with integrity \(‘honest, openness and fairness’\) under the Lincolnshire Police Code of Ethics \( **5.2**\). As a result of Hall’s research, the Assistant Chief Constable of Lincolnshire Police initiated a new practice under the Code of Ethics encouraging Freemasons to be open about their membership and for other officers to be less distrustful. 

 Hall also advised the Panel on their response to questions which had arisen within the force around romantic and sexual relationships between officers, leading to reform of force policy on the disclosure \(or not\) of such relationships. In particular, this was informed by Hall’s research on power inequalities within relationships and their potential to create situations of domestic abuse. This means considering a wider category of potential victims and putting in place procedural safeguards \(3.2; 3.4\). Further, Hall also conducted training sessions, based on his own work into ethical approaches to criminal justice \(3.1 **\)**, with officers on the Panel to help them apply various ethical approaches in their deliberations. Following Hall’s presentation of his research to the Panel on ‘the needs of victims in practice rather than just in theory’ \(drawn from 3.1\), and Hall’s questioning of the narrow approach to labelling the victims of crime, the Panel reflected on how victims were being identified and perceived under their current practices. Hall specifically flagged the issue of ‘hidden victims’ \(see 3.3\) and alerted the Panel and the PCC to the need to ensure that it is more inclusive in identifying and supporting victims including male victims of domestic abuse. Upon the Panel’s recommendation, Lincolnshire Police decided instead to embrace a broader notion of domestic violence which specifically distanced itself from more gendered notions of the issue.  On the basis of Hall’s input, Lincolnshire Police decided to reframe the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme to accommodate both male and female victims, as opposed to only female victims \( **5.3**\) and instituted a programme intended to support male victims of domestic abuse. This has then led to important practical changes in the support for male domestic abuse victims. Overall, there has been an increase in the availability of victim support services in the region, which benefitted from an additional funding of £380,000 secured by the PCC and local support groups from the Home office to support the initiative \( **5.4**\). This initiative includes new training sessions for professionals handling incidents of male domestic abuse; online training for police officers; and a new campaign to encourage male victims to come forward \( **5.4**\). 

1.  *Shaping Victim Support Policy and Practice* 

 As part of his research into the commissioning of victim services \(3.1; 3.3; 3.4\), Hall interviewed the Lincolnshire PCC in 2015. Recognising his expertise, in 2017 Hall was invited to join the Lincolnshire Victims Commissioning Group \(LVCG\), a panel constituted by the PCC to advise him on this commissioning role.  In 2017, the University of Lincoln organised a one\-day conference to which the PCC and all local victim service providers were invited. Hall presented his findings as to the functioning of the system \(based on 3.3\). This led to the introduction of a new model of victim support services that has since improved the quality of victim support \( **5.5, p 8**\), with the Lincolnshire PCC testifying that ‘ *the knowledge Matthew has provided within the groups has been invaluable to the development of a new model of victim services for Lincolnshire’* \( **5.6**\).  As a member of the LVCG, Hall regularly drew upon his research to inform high\-level policy discussions on the impact and support needs of crime victims \(3.1; 3.2; 3.3\) with the Commissioning Group. He drew attention to the need to tailor services to specific victim needs \(3.1, chap 4\) and canvassed the benefits of restorative justice \(3.1, chapter 5\).  He also advised them on allocation and funding matters in light of other commissioning practice \(3.1 chap 3\). Specifically, the funding and support model now supports five new services: Victim Outreach Service for all victims; support for victims of sexual assault, including a Sexual Assault Referral Centre and a Children and Young People’s Independent Sexual Violence Advisor \(CHISVA\); Restorative Justice services; Victim Information Portal; and the appointment of a Victim Services Delivery Manager \(Details on services is shown in **5.5, p 8**\). These changes were introduced within existing budgets that were fixed at £965,000/annum since 2017\-18 in a period of fiscal constraint.  The new victim support model is now part of the wider ‘Putting Victims First’ strategy adopted by Lincolnshire Police in 2018. This helped the Lincolnshire Police meet its commitments under the Victim Services Commissioning Framework to provide more effective services which meet local needs and achieve genuine outcomes for victims. 

 In February 2020, Hall chaired a national conference in London organized on behalf of the Ministry of Justice to feed into a revision of the government’s Code of Practice for Victims of Crime, of which victim service commissioning is a key part. At this session, Hall shared best practices on commissioning service \(3.1, chap 5, and 3.3\) as well as recent experiences drawn from his work with Lincolnshire Police.  The event was heavily representative of PCCs \(18 attended\) and victim service providers \(6 national and 11 regional organisations\) who were subject to PCC commissioning schemes.  Hall showcased his research \(3.3, 3.4, 3.5\), explaining how this was informing regional policing policy, and enabling the PCC to commission more responsive victim support services in Lincolnshire. Hall also facilitated the main event of the day, which was a consultation exercise on behalf of the Ministry of Justice to effect changes to the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime \( **5.7**\). 

1.  *Improving quality and enabling evidence\-based decision making by Lincolnshire’s PCC* 

 In 2018, Hall became a member of the Lincolnshire Police Crime Recording Confidence Panel \(CRCP\) \( **5.8**\). This Panel was initiated in 2018 in response to an Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services \(HMICFRS\) inspection that found that the force’s crime recording arrangements were ‘Inadequate’. The arrangements had serious shortcomings, including an estimated 9400 crimes \(19%\) not reported each year.  A particular concern was violent crimes, rape, and crimes involving vulnerable victims \(27% unreported; 9% of rapes were not reported\). 17% of rapes had not been recorded within 24 hours, delaying access to referrals to victim support services. Almost 20% of audited rapes were not accurately reported \( **5.9**\). Only 7 of 28 vulnerable victim crimes were recorded. HMICFRS demanded improvements in rigour and timeliness of reporting. 

 The CRCP was charged by the PCC with formulating and delivering policy and practical measures that would address the shortcoming identified by HMICFRS.  The CRCP made 8 key recommendations. Hall’s experience of measuring and evaluating crime data \(3.6\) shaped these measures, with two individual recommendations drawing upon Hall’s specific research concerning best practices in the commissioning of victim support services by PCCs \(3.1; 3.3\): First, that the Police and PCC should ‘develop and maintain strong links with victim support and 3<sup>rd</sup> sector charities with particular emphasis on vulnerability’ \( **5.8, Recommendation 6**\).  Second, that through any communications policy, victims should not be discouraged from seeking assistance and support \( **5.8, Recommendation 7**\), reflecting Hall’s research insights on the need to ensure that ‘hidden victims’ are not omitted from the provision of support services \(3.2 and 3.4\). 

 A HMICFRS reinspection in 2019 found these policy changes to have resulted in significant improvements to crime reporting practices \( **5.10**\).  The reporting of violent crime improved by 14.6% \(equivalent to an additional 3420 crimes\). The level of audited rape cases dropped to less than 1% \(i.e. 1 of 105 cases\).  Only 1.4% or reported sex offences were unrecorded, and one of the highest rates in the country. 22 of 23 vulnerable victim crimes were reported. These improvements can be directly attributed to the Panel policy interventions, as grounded by Hall’s research.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Fibre\-based communication is pivotal to global communication and connectivity and requires high\-quality lasers to drive the increasing demand. Collaboration between Prof Kelly and Compound Semiconductor Technologies \(CST\) Global transformed their business model to allow them to become a world\-leading semiconductor laser supplier, with an 88% turnover increase \(2016–2017\). The research led to high\-performance, low\-cost laser devices for next\-generation optical access networks and novel products for home and datacentre markets. Consequently, CST Global was acquired by Sivers IMA for \~GBP12 million \(2017\) and staff numbers have increased from 11 to 70. >GBP1 million of laser chips were sold each month to customers around the world, increasing internet access to households through fibre\-to\-the\-home \(FTH\) connectivity. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Professor Kelly’s EPSRC project on High Power, High Frequency Mode\-locked Semiconductor Lasers \(EP/E065112/1\) enabled him to build on a strong semiconductor lasers capability to design, fabricate and test indium phosphide\-based lasers. The fundamental research \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\] generated the necessary understanding of device behaviour and the capability to simulate and therefore design devices according to the intended application. For example, the development of high\-power devices increased the output power of the laser from 50 to 200mW, opening up new applications such as automotive LIDAR \(light detection and ranging\). 

 A collaboration was established with CST Global in 2011, supported by a UofG First Step Award. CST Global made a strategic business decision to move from being a foundry service to manufacturing their own products. They were already familiar with Prof Kelly’s expertise, and the University had the skills, tools and test equipment to design, develop and characterise devices manufactured by CST Global. This allowed them to work together to quickly develop initial data for a potential Gigabit Passive Optical Networks \(GPON\) laser product that was presented to customers. 

 Given positive market feedback, a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) was initiated to focus on the delivery of the first product, a high\-performance, low\-cost laser device for next generation optical access networks. The KTP associate, Dr Horacio Cantu, focused on understanding the electrical and parasitic behaviour of the device to allow performance optimisation. During this project, three semiconductor laser products were developed and introduced into the marketplace \[5.4\]. 

 The research collaboration was then extended to include research into low\-cost optical/radio interfaces, advanced fabrication techniques and blue laser diodes. The blue laser research \(supported by EPSRC / Innovate – CoolBlue EP/R001774/1\) resulted in the first practical blue semiconductor distributed feedback \(DFB\) laser.This was made possible by novel gratings designed by Prof Kelly and fabricated in the University’s James Watt Nanofabrication Centre. Innovate UK projects and direct funding by CST Global of Prof Kelly resulted in the development of 10 Gbit/s and 25 Gbit/s laser devices and the development of etched facets. 

 The range of projects and the fact that they are predominately Innovate UK\-funded demonstrates the commercial focus of the ongoing collaborative research. Applying the understanding developed in the research projects to device designs and improvements to key device parameters led to further application\-oriented publications \[3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]. 

 A recent illustrative example of commercialisation of basic research is the work on advanced etching. A new semiconductor etch tool was made available to Prof Kelly via a GBP3 million EPSRC manufacturing grant. An industrial PhD scholarship \(2014–2018\), co\-funded by CST Global, developed advanced etching techniques on this tool and applied these techniques to the development of etched facets. This is a technology that had the potential to greatly reduce the cost of CST Global’s manufacturing process and led to an Innovate UK project \(LOWPASS\) which successfully took this to production. The process is now used by CST Global in high\-volume manufacturing and is set to become ubiquitous in their products.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Over the past decade, the world has become increasingly connected, as high\-speed fibre optic digital communication brings Internet access to households around the globe with fibre\-to\-the\-home \(FTH\) connectivity. The roll\-out of this technology depends on fast, powerful, low\-cost lasers to facilitate the data transfer over these connections. The collaboration between UofG’s Prof Kelly, and CST Global has enabled them to become a world\-leading supplier of semiconductor lasers \[5.1, 5.2\]. Whilst the impact of this research is primarily economic, secondary impacts exist through CST Global being able to meet the societal demand for access to fibre optic broadband and cable TV. 

 CST Global acknowledge that Prof Kelly’s expertise is what drew them to collaborate with UofG: The Former CEO of CST Global: *""\[Kelly\] is a world\-authority on gallium nitride and indium phosphide optical devices, with both academic and commercial experience in these areas. He has successfully commercialized a range of technologies, critical to next\-generation, high\-speed applications, where CST Global is currently producing and developing new products”* \[5.3\]. 

 Prior to its collaboration with UofG, CST Global was a foundry business, providing custom fabrication services \[5.1 paragraph 4\]. Expansion of CST Global was dependent on a business model change to selling products instead of services. The skills and capability available at UofG in high\-speed communications systems testing, device modelling and advanced characterisation \(built up via Scottish Research Pool investment and Research Council project funding\) allowed CST Global to develop products through funded collaborations \[5.1 paragraph 4, 5.4\]. 

 The close working relationship with UofG has been maintained since 2011 through research collaborations, secondments and KTPs. One of the first collaborations was a Knowledge Transfer Partnership: *'The main achievement for the project was the successful development of the 10Gbit/s product to a maturity where it was shipping to customers as samples and towards the end of the project as product. The significance of this has not to be underestimated. \[This\] has allowed CSTG to move up the value chain in terms of product complexity and therefore margin’* \[5.4\]. The former\-KTP Associate is now an employee of CST Global and continues to liaise with UofG and transfer knowledge to CST Global’s engineers \[5.1 paragraph 5\]. 

 The ongoing partnership has resulted in three new semiconductor laser product lines being introduced, with more in development through Prof Kelly’s secondments to the company. These products generated >GBP10 million in orders during 2016 alone \[5.1 paragraph 5\], which enabled CST Global’s expansion into the Asian market and up the value chain to higher profit margin products, moving from USD0.2 per unit to USD2 per unit, with the potential to increase to USD20 per unit once the 25 Gbit/s product line has been qualified \[5.1 paragraph 5\]. CST Global are now among the top suppliers in the world, with most of their market in China and India \[5.1 paragraph 6, 5.2\]. Due to its strong performance and potential for growth, CST Global was acquired by Sivers IMA in April 2017 for \~GBP12 million \[5.1 paragraph 6, 5.2\]. CST Global’s success from collaborating with UofG was the key driver of this acquisition, which has since led to further expansion of CST Global and also improved funding access \[5.1 paragraph 6\]. 

 As a consequence of the critical UofG collaboration, CST Global has become Europe’s highest volume laser supplier, shipping GBP1 million laser chips/month. CST Global currently employs 70 chip fabrication staff at a facility near Glasgow \[5.2\]. Its annual sales turnover for 2015/16 was \~GBP3.5 million; as a consequence of the acquisition, turnover was 88% higher in 2017 \(GBP6.7 million\) \[5.1, 5.5, 5.6\]. 

 CST Global links with UK supply chain companies, thus providing a vibrant industry sector. CST Global has been a partner in Horizon 2020 project iBrow, enabling enhanced wireless broadband data transfer, with industry partners including IQE, Alcatel\-Lucent and InescTec, and is leading two Innovate UK\-funded projects, CoolBlue and LowPass, working with UofG. CST Global’s strong connection with UofG has kept the company ‘ *at the forefront of the III\-V compound semiconductor market*’ \[5.7\]. 

 In 2017, through an EPSRC Impact Accelerator Account grant, Prof. Kelly was seconded to CST Global to develop capability in the 25 Gbit/s laser market supplying the datacentre market, a high\-growth area. In 2018, the company announced alpha testing of 25 Gbit/s lasers that will command far higher prices than existing products while maintaining the same chip manufacturing footprint, delivering a higher profit margin for the same manufacturing yield \[5.8\]. 

 Demand for such products is rapidly growing in China \[5.9\] where the number of cable TV subscribers is expected to rise to 353 million by 2022 \[5.10, page 1\]. CST Global’s ability to meet China’s increased demand for internet\-enabled TV is enabled by collaboration with Prof Kelly at UofG.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Hypercholesterolaemia remains under\-treated worldwide. Inclisiran is a first\-in\-class, siRNA\-based therapeutic that lowers LDL cholesterol by targeting PCSK9 mRNA. Professor Ray at Imperial College designed and led the clinical trials that demonstrated that inclisiran, given as two injections/year, reduces LDL cholesterol by 50%. It is well tolerated and addresses the challenge of non\-adherence to oral lipid\-lowering drugs. The safety and efficacy data and benefits evident to healthcare resulted in Novartis buying The Medicines Company, the manufacturers of inclisiran, for $9.7 billion and an NHS partnership with Novartis to make the drug available to the NHS for evaluation in 300,000 patients. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease \(CVD\) and reducing low\-density lipoprotein cholesterol \(LDL\-C\) significantly reduces CVD risk. Statins are the standard therapy, but intolerance and reliance on long\-term adherence limit their population impact. Professor Ray and colleagues at Imperial evaluated the association of adherence and treatment intensity with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with documented CVD. The lowest cardiovascular risk was observed among adherent patients receiving high\-intensity therapy, and the highest risk was observed among non\-adherent patients receiving low\-intensity therapy. Suboptimal cholesterol lowering and non\-adherence to treatments requiring daily dosing resulted in 12,000 excess cardiovascular events annually \(1\). 

 Proprotein convertase subtilisin\-kexin type 9 protease \(PCSK9\) is an attractive alternative target for reducing LDL\-C levels; loss\-of\-function mutations in the gene encoding PCSK9 are associated with low LDL\-C levels and reduced risk of heart attack. For over 15 years, PCSK9 has been viewed as intractable to small molecule discovery. Monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 have been developed to lower LDL\-C but require 26 injections annually and are expensive. Inclisiran is a small interfering \(si\)RNA developed by The Medicines Company that inhibits PCSK9 synthesis. 

 In 2015, The Medicines Company approached Professor Ray to design the clinical development programme for inclisiran. He led the design and implementation of the Phase 2 ORION 1 trial, a multi\-centre, double\-blind, multiple\-ascending\-dose trial of inclisiran, administered as a subcutaneous injection to patients at high\-risk for CVD. A total of 501 patients were recruited to compare \(a\) a single dose of placebo with 200/300/500 mg of inclisiran, or \(b\) two doses of placebo with 100/200/300 mg of inclisiran at days 1 and 90. The primary end\-point was the change in LDL\-C level from baseline at 180 days. Results demonstrated that two doses of 300mg of inclisiran maintained a 50% cholesterol reduction over six months \(2\). Further analyses and modelling suggested after two doses 90 days apart, a 6\-monthly dosing regimen could maintain this level of 50% cholesterol reduction \(3\). Professor Ray led the communication of data at conferences and in peer\-review journals, New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA Cardiology, putting forward the concept of time\-averaged reductions in LDL\-C with infrequent dosing \(2, 3\). 

  

 Professor Ray then designed, with the sponsors, three pivotal Phase 3 trials which enrolled approximately 3,600 patients and was the PI of the largest of these, ORION 11. The latter demonstrated that a 6\-monthly dosing schedule sustained a 50% reduction in cholesterol over 18 months \(4\), which was validated by ORION 9 and 10 \(5\). These data showed that this first\-in\-class therapy was effective, safe and well tolerated. The publications reporting this were voted by the Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Society as joint papers of the year and the publication of ORION 10 and 11 was voted by NEJM editors among the 13 top papers they published in 2020 and likely to transform clinical medicine. 

 Professor Ray and Dr Brandts then assessed the population benefits from cumulative exposure to lower cholesterol. Projecting over a 50\-year therapeutic window the cumulative benefits of maintaining the same LDL\-C differences, one might expect a 31.2% relative risk reduction for statins, 41.6% relative risk reduction for monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9, and 52% relative risk reduction for siRNAs \(6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 CVD is the number one cause of mortality globally. LDL\-C lowering is pivotal to reducing cardiovascular events \(such as heart attacks\), with international guidelines recommending lower LDL\-C targets for those at highest risk. 

 The central approach to achieving these targets has relied upon the use of statins, alone or in combination with other small molecule drugs, which requires patient adherence to a daily dosing regimen. The ORION trials developed and led by Professor Ray at Imperial College represent a paradigm shift in treatment strategy. Inclisiran is a siRNA that inhibits PCSK9 synthesis. siRNA is a novel technology and there was limited experience of its use as a therapeutic agent in humans. By providing compelling evidence that inclisiran is well tolerated and safe when given 6 monthly and that it results in a sustained and clinically important reduction in cholesterol, the ORION trials have opened a new class of therapeutics. Furthermore, by avoiding daily dosing, it enables adherence and the opportunity to meet guidelines for LDL\-C reduction, which translate into a reduction in CVD. A competitor approach, namely monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9, requires 26 injections per year. 

 In 2020, the European Medicines Agency and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use approved inclisiran \(brand name Leqvio\) \[ **A**\]. The data from the ORION studies designed and led by Professor Ray were key to the regulatory approval of inclisiran for hypercholestrolaemia: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

 The potential of this novel first\-in\-class therapy, together with Professor Ray and Dr Brandts’ demonstration of the major population health impact if adopted by healthcare systems, resulted in Novartis buying The Medicines Company and inclisiran for **$9.7 billion**, completed in Jan 2020 \[ **C**\]. Novartis highlighted specifically the results of the comprehensive Phase 3 inclisiran program, which showed potent and durable reduction of >50% in LDL\-C on top of standard of care with an excellent safety profile, as the basis for this acquisition \[ **C**\]. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

 Professor Ray’s report on how the cumulative effects of long\-term uncontrolled LDL\-C placed millions of people at increased cardiovascular risk shaped stakeholder acceptance of inclisiran's unique value proposition. With this understanding, Professor Ray together with The Medicines Company, put forward the proposition that a treatment administered by healthcare professionals in line with clinical practice that overcomes non\-adherence could address some of the healthcare challenges for the NHS in its Long\-Term NHS plan. This has led to a unique partnership between Novartis and the NHS to enable the drug to be made available for 300,000 NHS patients to understand how to best implement this therapy in primary care where the bulk of “at risk patients” are managed \[ **D**\]. This collaboration has the potential to prevent 55,000 heart attacks and strokes and save up to 30,000 lives over the next ten years.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In the course of her research for the monograph on Carmen Miranda \(3.2\), facilitated by a Leverhulme\-British Academy Senior Research Fellowship \(2011\), Shaw discovered that fans aged over 65 world\-wide still use the star’s films and music as a way of improving their emotional wellbeing. Interviews with fans revealed how the lively music and colourful, visual spectacle in her film performances combined to engage spectators and boost their mood. In her research on the Brazilian musical film tradition called ‘chanchada’, Shaw identified the reasons for its popularity, chiefly the importance of recognisable national stars, well\-known songs and comic scenes \(3.1\). This mix of comedy and music ensured that these films appealed to all ages and were family entertainment, and were thus widely consumed by children and adults of varied social classes and ethnic/regional backgrounds during cinema screenings in the 1950s across Brazil \(given the national reach of the main producer, Atlântida studio’s exhibition circuit\), as well as being re\-experienced by adults who were children in the 1950s when screened on public TV channels in the 1990s and 2000s. Shaw’s research revealed the strategies used by the creators of these films to ensure that audiences identified with the characters on screen, and by extension the stars that played them \(3.1 and 3.3\). These strategies included incorporating tokenistic Afro\-Brazilian performers alongside white stars, featuring regional accents in the dialogue and regional musical genres, and creating a parallel local star system via the Atlântida\-controlled film press, that ensured these performers became ingrained in national popular consciousness. 

 Hallam identified the importance of memories of stars in her research on British TV series \(3.5\). Her research into Liverpool on screen \(3.6\) highlighted the existence of a wealth of images of recognisable locations and their power to trigger reminiscence. By combining their research, Shaw and Hallam were uniquely placed to devise the ‘Cinema, Memory and Wellbeing’ \(CMW\) project in 2014\-2015, initially drawing on Shaw’s knowledge of English\-language films starring Carmen Miranda and Hallam’s expertise regarding local amateur films and feature films set in Liverpool during the 1950s and 60s. Funded by an International Knowledge Exchange Voucher \[University of Liverpool – UoL\] the North West Film Archive produced bespoke DVDs of carefully selected clips of Liverpool and subsequently Manchester. Shaw extended the project to Brazil, using her knowledge of ‘chanchada’ comedies and Carmen Miranda’s Hollywood films that were screened in Brazil. Shaw and Hallam conducted research into the wellbeing benefits for audience members aged over 65 of group screenings of short sequences of these films combined with interactive discussions stimulated by verbal and visual prompts, in nursing homes and day care centres on Merseyside, and in a GP practice in the city of Petrópolis, Brazil. Advised by colleagues in the School of Psychology, they assessed the effectiveness of wellbeing measurement tools by implementing them into pilot studies \(2015\-2017\), analysing the results and studying the relative effectiveness of different types of film material in stimulating group reminiscence and in turn producing emotional wellbeing benefits. Interviews with participants and carers/healthcare professionals in a variety of contexts were analysed, leading to unexpected results of self\-reported improvements in staff morale and team spirit, as well as emotional wellbeing/resilience benefits for carers. Shaw and Hallam drew on the results of this research to create the ‘Cinema, Memory and Wellbeing’ Toolkit \(3.4\), in English and in Portuguese, documenting evidence of different kinds of wellbeing benefits resulting from this project, as well as practical advice for those running such activities. In 2018, funded by an ODA Seed Fund award \(UoL\), Shaw implemented the Toolkit during a 4\-week CMW Film Club at the São João de Deus nursing home \(Itaipava, Petrópolis\), a centre of excellence for dementia care, conducting research into its effectiveness for older adults with dementia. She received an Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund award \(UoL\) in 2018 to test digital music\- and image\-related reminiscence tools with older adults, people with dementia and carers. The research funded by both awards is published in a book written with colleagues from UoL’s Music Department \(3.4\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research by Shaw on film star Carmen Miranda and the ‘chanchada’ tradition in Brazilian cinema, particularly her explorations of the reasons for the enduring appeal of, and potential wellbeing benefits of group watching of both, and research by Hallam on the history of film culture in Liverpool, have directly inspired the **creation, use and application of the downloadable ‘Cinema, Memory and Wellbeing’ \(CMW\) Toolkit for carers** \(available in English and Portuguese\) which has been widely adopted in the UK and Brazil. The Toolkit’s methodology, refined over a series of pilot projects in both countries involving Rowan Garth BUPA care home, Liverpool \(25 residents\), the Fazenda Inglesa GP practice, Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil \(68 older adult users\), and Company Matters4U day care centre, Liverpool \(60 older adult users\), and related training provision devised and delivered by Shaw, have contributed to the **strengthening of carer resilience** and the **development of additional skills** for carers/health professionals. This has led to significant **changes in practice** regarding the use of films with the residents of nursing homes and users of day care centres and GP practices \(Merseyside and Brazil\), as well as **changes in practice** regarding the running of age\-/dementia\-friendly cinema screenings and the use of film with participants of film clubs for the socially isolated \(Merseyside and Manchester\) and patients on NHS dementia wards \(Greater Manchester\). A further impact of adoption of the Toolkit methodology, rooted in Shaw and Hallam’s respective research on film/TV audiences and their collaborative research on how audio\-visual stimuli can be best used as a reminiscence tool among older adults and those living with dementia, has been a **positive change in the observed behaviour and wellbeing** of participants in CMW activities, as well as **improvements in relationships between carers and cared\-for, and between the cared\-for**. 

 In 2018 Shaw implemented the Toolkit during a 4\-week CMW Film Club at the Lar São João de Deus nursing home in Itaipava, Petrópolis, a centre of excellence for dementia care, conducting parallel research into its effectiveness for those living with dementia. This involved 33 participants \(18 residents, 5 of whom had a dementia diagnosis and 2 others with cognitive impairments of different kinds; and 15 older adults from the local community who attend the home’s day care centre\). The Toolkit/methodology has since been adopted by care homes, individual carers \(paid and unpaid\), charities, cultural institutions and health care providers in the UK and Brazil, leading to positive changes for older adults, the socially isolated \(particularly during the Covid\-19 lockdown\), those living with dementia and their carers. \(Adopters in Brazil: 6 community health workers \[ACSs\] at Fazenda Inglesa GP practice; 4 care staff at Lar SJdD; 38 carers/health workers who attended Toolkit training at Museu da Imagem e do Som \[MIS\], Campinas; Adopters in the UK: 8 staff at Company Matters4U day care centres and Rowan Garth care home; 12 volunteers at Alzheimer’s Society \[Sefton, 29.1.2020\]; 12 unpaid carers; 25 attendees of Toolkit training at the Plaza Community Cinema \[13% family carers; 20% from community charities; 47% from residential care homes; 20% NHS employees\]; 14 Manchester versions of the Toolkit used in NHS hospital dementia wards/ day care centres in 11.2020\). 

 The adoption of the Toolkit methodology has **strengthened carers’ resilience and sense of worth in their role** and **developed additional skills and provided cost\-effective resources and tools** for carers/health professionals. A community health worker \( *agente comunitário de saúde \-* ACS\) at the Fazenda Inglesa GP practice \(Ana Beatriz Renter, questionnaire, 10.10.2017, **5.1**\) said: “I was actually thinking of leaving the profession but after the event I had second thoughts, as I realised my job was worthwhile and that I was needed. I felt more valued. In our team we became closer afterwards, even with difficult colleagues.” Another ACS \(Zélia Sousa, video testimony transcript, 1.7.2015, **5.1**\) said: “It gave me more motivation, I had more desire to work. You gave us more ideas.” A speech and language therapist who used the Toolkit with people with dementia in the UK said: “It was a positive experience for staff to discuss people’s experiences relating to the film footage – helping to see the depth and complexity of people’s lives.” She gave the following example: “Conversations with one resident led to discussions about their time living in South Africa which was particularly interesting. Interesting subjects and stories like this can help build relationships between staff and patients and to get better insight into the lives that people have lived” \(Ellen McGowan, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, 16.12.2020, **5.8**\). Claire Marrett \(Together Dementia Support\) added: “I have been able to use it to ‘fill in the gaps’ where I have known some of the life history of people but have not had the tools to help them elaborate on talking about this time in this \[sic\] life” \(16.12.2020, **5.8**\). 

 CMW events and the Toolkit led to significant **changes in working practices**. The Fazenda Inglesa GP practice in Brazil now runs a social group specifically for older people focused on conversation and reminiscence, and the ACSs have chosen to do further training to work with older adults. \(Zélia Sousa questionnaire 25.11.2019, **5.1**\). Eleanor O’Hanlon, managing director of the Company Matters4U day care centres in Liverpool confirmed that her “staff have mirrored techniques used at the \[CMW\] event \(to encourage people to join in\).” \( **5.3**\) A carer at Waterloo Park Day Centre, Merseyside said: “Since using the Toolkit we have changed the way that we have been doing reminiscence groups. We have ensured that we only use smaller clips \[…\] so people who are living with dementia can retain the information easier, don’t get as distracted.” \(video testimony of care assistant Leah Rossindale, **5.2**\) 100% of the attendees at the Toolkit training at the Plaza Community Cinema reported that they would change their current practice in response to the Toolkit, and incorporate additional activities suggested in it. \(67% said they would now use the short clip \+ interactive break format; 67% would combine archive footage with music; and 67% would incorporate group discussions into film events.\) 12 months after the training, changes had been embedded at Sefton New Directions adult care services, as confirmed by care assistant Frances Deaves: “After we were invited to join you last October at your cinema, memory and wellbeing event \[…\], we took away some really useful tips and used the tool kit to enhance our reminiscence activities. We recreated our TV lounge to look more like a cinema with rows of comfy chairs and dimmed lights. We shortened the time that we screened a film into two halves with a drink and a snack in between as we realized a full film can be too long for those living with dementia to concentrate on.” \( **5.6**\). Of the attendees at the Toolkit training at the MIS\-Campinas, 55% declared that they would make a change in response to the Toolkit; 51% would make a change to what activities they offer and how they offer them; 21% noted significant changes that they would make to their current practice \(e.g. changing how films are introduced, giving older adults the opportunity to talk about feelings in relation to cinematic memories\); and 30% who had never used film in their current settings planned to introduce film activities through use of the Toolkit. Brazilian care home psychologist Marly de Souza Galvão stated: “I work with old people and I would like to take back to my team this activity to be carried out in our institution. \[…\] I am in charge of a home for 21 old people and I am going to introduce this project there because it will undoubtedly be very good for the home.” \( **5.7**\) An NHS occupational therapist \(OT\) who used the Toolkit with dementia inpatients said that the format of the CMW session also made him and his colleagues consider new ways of focussing purely on group reminiscence rather than weaving elements of reminiscence into other group activities like baking, adding that “having used the CMW concept it has prompted us to consider focussing on regular Reminiscent \[sic\] groups” \(Shaun Dorrington, email, 15.12.2020, **5.8\).** 

 The CMW project and Toolkit have also **changed how cinemas/cultural institutions embed age\-/dementia\-friendly film screenings into their activities**. According to Community Engagement Manager of the Plaza Community Cinema in Crosby, Merseyside \(video testimony of Christine Physick, **5.2**\): “Before working on this project I’d wanted \[…\] to include some creativity \[to dementia\-friendly screenings\] with the groups, rather than people just coming to watch a film \[…\] so that for me would be the lesson or learning I’ve taken from this \[…\] We would be looking at doing a lot more creative, arts\-based projects \[…\] with a view to linking it to some of the films.” Planned CMW events for socially isolated older people in partnership with the charities Liverpool Cares and Manchester Cares were replaced during the Covid\-19 lockdown with a CMW Facebook page \( [https://www.facebook.com/pg/](https://www.facebook.com/pg/)<ins>cinemamemoryandwellbeing</ins><ins>\)</ins> featuring weekly posts of a variety of short film clips and weekly live Zoom ‘social clubs’ based on the CMW model, involving on average 15\-20 participants. Manchester Cares will adopt the CMW methodology when it resumes its face\-to\-face film clubs. Heather Madden \(Social Clubs Coordinator, testimony 13.7.2020, **5.5**\) stated: “Going forward I intend to use the CMW method in a variety of ways. Firstly, I will do some social clubs that feature documentary shorts all on a particular theme. I will then have shorter discussions in between each short \[…\] On evenings when I do have feature length documentaries, I will try to plan it in a way that allows for several pauses for reflection and shorter discussions at points during the film instead of just one big discussion at the end.” The Facebook page further engaged members of the public \(as of 31.12.2020: 342 followers;\) and a Portuguese\-language version was created in partnership with the Museum of Image and Sound \(MIS\-Campinas\) \(as of 31.12.2020: 365 followers\). 

 CMW events and the Toolkit have led to a **positive change in observed behaviour and wellbeing** of older adult participants, including those living with dementia; Eleanor O’Hanlon of Company Matters4U day care centre noted that “after the event a few of the more shy \[sic\] males were more confident in joining in with activities \[…\] A lady who previously wouldn’t sing on the microphone on the karaoke \(afternoon\) now joins in with gusto.” \(13.11.2017, **5.3**\) The CMW methodology \(short clip format \+ interaction/ discussion\) had the following effect on participants in Manchester Cares social clubs, as Heather Madden \(Social Clubs Coordinator\) stated: “I have noticed a positive change in the way people interact at the weekly CMW chats compared to how they are at face\-to\-face screenings of longer films. The key positive change I have noticed is around the content of conversation. Generally, at face to face film nights people will spend a lot of time ‘catching up’, talking about their days/weeks or upcoming plans. During the weekly zoom chats there has been a lot more in\-depth and personal discussions.” \(testimony 13.7.2020, **5.5**\). Abbie Beckett \(Social Clubs Coordinator at Liverpool Cares\) said that the CMW methodology “has definitely changed the way that I will run social clubs going forward. I think there’s a real want for the CMW clubs to continue in some way face\-to\-face after lockdown is over, and neighbours love watching the short video clips to both bring back memories and discuss with their friends.” \( **5.5**\). An NHS occupational therapist who used the CMW Toolkit with dementia inpatients stated that “Occupational therapy assistants \(OTAs\) report that seeing their patients’ therapeutic engagement and pleasure they gained from watching the clips was very moving”, adding that the use of the Toolkit “created group discussion, was thought provoking and had a positive impact on patient wellbeing. One particular patient’s mood was elevated positively after the group, from his pre\-occupied state before the group” \(Shaun Dorrington, email questionnaire, 15.12.2020, **5.8\).** Jo Davies, manager of a day centre for people with dementia, said of her experience of using the CMW method: “it brought out many memories and conversations to clients who normally sat back and listened rather than taking part \[…\] By giving them time in smaller groups or a one to one they blossomed” \(email, 15.12.2020, **5.8\).** After using the Toolkit with dementia inpatients, speech and language therapist Ellen McGowan said: “One particular benefit was it being a good distraction for a patient who was agitated on the ward and repeatedly asking to go to bed – \[he\] got engaged with the film and started talking about his university days at Manchester”. She added that its use “\[r\]educed agitation, increased activity, got people communicating with each other” \(16.12.2020, **5.8**\) **.** 

 Use of the Toolkit in organising film events led to an **improvement in the relationship between carers and cared\-for, and between the cared\-for.** One of the ACSs at the GP practice in Brazil \(Ana Beatriz Renter questionnaire 10.10.2017, **5.1**\) said that “My view of the old people changed – I discovered that they need more attention, company, affection, more activities specifically for them. \[…\] Before the public had a more formal relationship with us \(health workers\) – but after seeing us in fancy dress they are now more at ease with us, more willing to talk and open up to us. It has helped break down barriers between us and the patients. They now invite all of us \(ACSs\) to go into their home \(before the event they wouldn’t let us in, and we dealt with them on the doorstep\)”. This improved relationship has continued, as confirmed by the same ACS in a testimony of 25.11.2019 \( **5.1**\): “Thanks to the work Lisa \[Shaw\] did here at the health centre and her help, the health team learned how to care more for the old people, give them more attention, and actively seek them out, making the old people more interested in events like this one \(the film event\), they participated more and were happier. This would not have happened without Lisa’s cinema project and her research in this area.” The newly arrived resident priest at the dementia nursing home in Brazil, which also runs a free day care centre for older adults who live locally, noted how the project broke down barriers between the two groups, providing a focus \(film clips and the reminiscences triggered\) that enabled them to identify with each other and find something in common: “The ones from outside the home, who are more agile, approached those in wheelchairs \[residents\], they all came together, there was no division \[…\] they helped each other.” He continued: “It \[the CMW Film Club\) gives value to their \[the older adults’\] lives as they are. They are people with a history. They can feel that today, for us, the history they have lived through in the past continues to be important. That has made a big difference to them. It has been very useful for me, enabling me to create closer links with them.” \(Padre Guilherme, audio testimony 1.8.2018, **5.4**\). The impact of the CMW project was recognised by Shaw’s shortlisting for an AHRC/Wellcome Trust Medical Humanities Award for Best International Research \(2020\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In the wake of the Ebola epidemic, Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s research has significantly shaped changes to healthcare policy in Sierra Leone resulting in a health insurance scheme which positively impacts the lives of an estimated 2.7 million people working in the informal sector and provides free healthcare for children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Prior to 2018, financial barriers prevented poor and vulnerable populations from accessing healthcare services. Research by Jofre\-Bonet on healthcare provision, the interaction of public and private suppliers, willingness to pay for health products and health insurance, underpinned the premium that was set, as well as the design and enactment of the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance \(SLeSHI\) scheme. She also advised the government on the specifics of the implementation of the scheme from 2016 to 2018, enabling its successful introduction.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s body of research examines how health economics can contribute to improving healthcare systems, including cost\-effectiveness of treatments and Willingness To Pay \(WTP\) for healthcare products and services. Her work in Low\- and Middle\-Income Countries \(LMICs; defined by gross national income per capita and development assistance from The Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development, OECD\) included being part of a £1.5m project in the Gambia, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that compared the infection rates and cost effectiveness of two antibiotic administration strategies for trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. \[3.1\] In Brazil, Jofre\-Bonet and co\-authors investigated the Zika Virus epidemic in the first study exploring the economic and social impacts in depth. \[3.2\] Both of these projects applied health system economics and societal perspective methodologies to healthcare issues faced in LMICs, with the aim of developing efficient and effective health policy. This case study presents the further extension of this approach in Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s research on healthcare system reform in Sierra Leone. 

1.  **\(i\) WTP for improvements in healthcare in the informal sector in Sierra Leone** 

 Sierra Leone is a West African Low\-Income country with a population of around 7.3 million people and a life expectancy at birth of 60 years, according to  [World Health Organisation](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.cco.ki-SLE) \(WHO\) figures. In ‘post\-conflict’ reconstruction since the end of the civil war in 2002, it is estimated to have the world’s highest maternal mortality \(WHO\). Accessible and affordable healthcare services are a critical component of Sierra Leone’s economic and social development priorities. The civil war left the country economically vulnerable, with a fragmented healthcare system dependant almost entirely on the support of financial donors, and one of the highest rates of out\-of\-pocket health expenditure in the world. This means ill\-health can push people into poverty as they use savings, assets, or borrowing to pay for healthcare. After the loss of nearly 4,000 lives in the 2014\-15 Ebola crisis, the Government’s  [Health Sector Recovery Plan \(2015\-20\)](https://mohs2017.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/health-sector-recovery-plan-2015-2020.docx) identified the need for a universal health insurance system. The  [Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-FR365-DHS-Final-Reports.cfm) \(2019, p. 38\) found that 96% of people aged 15\-49 do not have health insurance. 

 Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s research focused specifically on willingness to pay \(WTP\) for improvements in healthcare in the ‘Informal Sector’. This sector encompasses small\-scale enterprise and business activities focused on the production of goods or services; those involved are likely to work on a casual labour basis and/or with family members, i.e. there is no formal contractual relationship. The World Bank\* finds that ‘Informality is pervasive in Sierra Leone, and formal work is restricted to the few most highly educated workers’ \(2016, p. 65\). In a working\-age population of slightly more than 3 million people, 62% are employed informally, with fewer than 10 percent in wage employment \(p. xiv\). The informal sector is estimated at around 2.7 million people. 

 The first stage of the research took place between 2011 and 2016, with Dr Alice Mesnard \(City, University of London\) and former PhD student, Joseph Kamara. \[3.3\] They developed a survey to elicit the WTP for improvements in healthcare from individuals in the informal sector, using a Discrete Choice Model approach. Eight informal sector activities were selected: petty trading, subsistence farming, commercial bike riding, cattle rearing, fishing, tailoring, mining, and quarrying. A random effect logit model was used to estimate households’ WTP for an improvement in coverage, choice of health care provider, and a reduction in waiting time. The study revealed that households were WTP more to have better attributes \(better coverage, less waiting time\) and to go to a faith\-based provider. The findings also suggest that location mattered in determining the WTP, with urban households WTP more for health insurance than their rural counterparts at Sierra Leone Leones \(SLL\) 54,348 \(USD7.34\) and SLL 37,250.5 \(USD5.03\), respectively. \[3.3\] 

 **\(ii\) WTP for Health Insurance in the Informal Sector in Sierra Leone** 

1.  Subsequently, in 2016, Jofre\-Bonet was commissioned by the government in Sierra Leone and used a very large \(10,000obs\) tailored survey to elicit the WTP for health insurance \(HI\) of individuals in the informal sector in Sierra Leone. \[3.4\] The survey used a Double\-Bounded Dichotomous Choice with Follow Up contingent valuation method, an approach chosen because it has been shown to yield more accurate WTP estimates than the alternative single\-bounded method. **89% of respondents said they would pay for health insurance to avoid expensive pay\-as\-you\-go healthcare.** The article examines the individual factors associated with the likelihood of joining the HI scheme at a variety of premium levels. The analysis showed that a premium could be set at approximately SLL 20,000 SLL \(USD3.54\) per month but noted that setting a single premium too high would jeopardise the participation of certain groups, impacting the financial risk\-pooling mechanism. Jofre\-Bonet’s work challenged pre\-conceptions on feasible premium fees for healthcare coverage compared to what the informal sector was already paying out\-of\-pocket for medical care. Discussions with Professor Jofre\-Bonet around the optimal premium underpinned the government’s policy decision to set the joining price of the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance \(SLeSHI\) scheme at SLL 15,000 when it rolled out in 2018.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s research and her extensive engagement with the Government of Sierra Leone resulted in a transformation of healthcare policy and practice with the introduction of the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance \(SLeSHI\) scheme. Through establishing willingness to pay \(WTP\) for Health Insurance \(HI\) in the Informal Sector, her work has had a significant impact on the provision of support for poor and vulnerable populations, improving the lives of an estimated 2.7 million workers who did not previously have access to affordable healthcare in this post\-conflict Low Income country **.** 

 **\(i\) Influencing the development of a national Health Insurance scheme** 

 In 2016, introducing a national Health Insurance scheme became a priority not only for the government in power – the All People’s Congress \(APC\) – but also for major donors such as the World Bank and the then UK Department for International Development. Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s initial research with Dr Joseph Kamara \[3.3\] led to her being commissioned by the National Social Security and Insurance Trust \(NASSIT\) of Sierra Leone to carry out an extensive study to elicit the WTP of the informal sector. The significance of this work was confirmed by the Director General of NASSIT, a senior civil servant: 

 “Two key academic documents helped to shape the idea of a National Health Insurance Scheme in Sierra Leone. First, the paper “A Discrete Choice Experiment to Elicit the Willingness to Pay for Health Insurance by the Informal Sector Workers in Sierra Leone” \[3.3\]… justified the practical need from the largest workforce in the country – the Informal Sector – to have a national health insurance scheme… The second and main paper \[was the\] ‘Willingness to Pay for Health Insurance among Informal Sector Workers in Sierra Leone’ \[3.4\].” \[5.1\] 

 As lead consultant of the study, Professor Jofre\-Bonet met with representatives of the World Health Organization \(WHO\) in Sierra Leone in October 2016 to discuss the results of the research and the obstacles to the implementation of the HI scheme. \[5.1\] Later that month, she presented the initial report to the Minister of Labour and Social Security and his team; health development partners working in Sierra Leone \(WHO, World Bank\); the private sector; and other government representatives, who were developing Sierra Leone’s HI scheme. 

 Afterwards, Professor Jofre\-Bonet held private talks on to the implications of the research and the feasibility of the implementation of the HI scheme with the Minister of Labour and Social Security; the Director General of the National Social Security and Insurance Trust; and the WHO country representative. \[5.1, 5.2\] Discussions with these stakeholders facilitated a better understanding of the barriers to the implementation of the HI scheme, including the characteristics of the healthcare provision up to that point; the persistent lack of funding for medical staff, and the recent reduction in their numbers due to the Ebola crisis. The commissioned study \[3.4\] helped to determine how much informal sector individuals were willing and able to pay and the frequency of payment. It also helped to increase the level of acceptance of the HI scheme among beneficiaries and increased the desire and willingness from Government and other partners to implement the scheme. \[5.3, 00.01.49\] 

 **\(ii\) Shaping the Sierra Leone Health Insurance Act of 2017** 

 A combination of the WTP survey results and insights from discussions with Professor Jofre\-Bonet helped the technical team and, subsequently, the Government of Sierra Leone to make an evidence\-based decision to go ahead with their plans for the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance \(SLeSHI\) scheme. This is confirmed by the Director General of NASSIT, who writes that Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s work: 

 “… was also subsequently used as the base for the preparation of the Social Health Insurance Policy for Sierra Leone and thereafter the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance Act of 2017.” \[5.1\] 

 The SLeSHI budget of around SLL 18.19 billion, on top of SLL 4.16 billion already invested, was approved in May 2017 \[5.4, p. 1\] and the policy gained Cabinet Approval in November 2017. \[5.5\] This laid the foundation for the SLeSHI Bill that was debated, approved, and ratified in Parliament in December 2017 leading to the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance Act of 2017. \[5.6\] Integrated implementation plans for the scheme are documented in key reports produced by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, including the National Health Sector Strategic Plan 2017\-21 \[5.7a, e.g. p. 55\] and the **National Nursing and Midwifery Strategic Plan 2019\-2023.** \[5.7b, e.g. p. 36\] 

 **\(iii\) Implementation and Evaluation of the SLeSHI Scheme** 

 Returning to Sierra Leone after his studies,  [Dr Kamara](http://slconcordtimes.com/parliament-okays-sleshi-coordinator-says-its-one-of-the-best-laws-in-sierra-leone/) played a key role in setting up these far\-reaching changes as the National Co\-ordinator of the SLeSHI Scheme, which was  [launched by President Ernest Bai Koroma](http://slconcordtimes.com/president-koroma-launches-social-health-insurance-scheme/) on 16 February 2018 at a well\-attended ceremony in Freetown. \[5.3, 00.02.47\] Following the change of government in April 2018, President Julius Maada Bio of the Sierra Leone People’s Party \(SLPP\) committed to the implementation and extension of the SLeSHI Scheme. \[5.8, p.41\] 

 The government’s 2019 Midterm Review Report for the United Nations Human Rights Council \(UNHRC\) confirmed the extension of the scheme to the Informal Sector: 

 “112. In December 2017, the Parliament of Sierra Leone approved the introduction of the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance Scheme \(SLeSHI\). This schemeis administered by NASSIT. NASSIT intends to extend the social security protection to the Informal Sector.” \[5.9, p.27\] 

 The SLeSHI Scheme is also a fundamental element of Sierra Leone’s Universal Health Coverage \(UHC\) plan which means all Sierra Leoneans will receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. \[5.10\] The UHC Partnership – which includes organisations such as the WHO and UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office – has more recently “shifted its support towards the development, implementation and monitoring of the National Health Sector Strategic Plan 2017\-2021 as well as the establishment of Sierra Leone’s Social Health Insurance scheme”. \[5.10\] 

 The SLeSHI financial risk\-pooling mechanism which is now in place sets out to “ensure the cross\-subsidization between the rich and the poor and also ensure the healthy cross\-subsidize the sick” \[5.5, p.20\].  The changes mean all workers in the informal sector are required by law to join the scheme and to pay an equivalent flat rate of $2 USD a month to access a health insurance scheme for primary care. \[5.5, p.24\] Those in the formal sector will pay 6% of their salaries into the scheme ‘at source’. The government will also pay a contribution: 

 “Government of Sierra Leone shall provide subsidy to the SLeSHI Fund to match up the fiscal gap that will be created mainly due to the inclusion of the exempted groups \(all children below 12 years, all pregnant women, all lactating mothers, the disabled, senior citizens above 65 years and indigents\) and the meagre amount that is been paid by the Informal Sector."" \[5.5, p.25\] 

 The full roll out of the scheme has been delayed due to the Covic\-19 pandemic but realising the benefits of improved health outcomes in the working population to Sierra Leone’s economic and social development remains a political priority. President Bio said in January 2021: “We are following through on our promise in the New Direction Manifesto \[5.8\] and The Medium\-Term National Development Plan to increase affordable access to quality healthcare service delivery. That goal also aligns with a central plank of our human capital development priorities \- access to quality healthcare \- and the Sustainable Development Goal 3 on delivering good health and well\-being to our citizens”. \[5.11, p. 2\] The SLeSHI health insurance scheme will enhance the health and quality of life of the estimated 2.7 million people in the informal sector in Sierra Leone by improving access to affordable healthcare.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Go Higher West Yorkshire \(GHWY\) engaged Formby \(AF\) to perform Realist Evaluation \(RE\) of Widening Participation \(WP\) activities in West Yorkshire to provide high quality WP to help young people to enter HE: 

 1. Formby embedded RE principles into all WP participation activities to develop enhanced WP provision. The outcome being: *“not only more effective practice, in terms of the positive impact we are able to demonstrate, but it has also enhanced GHWY’s reputation amongst local and national stakeholders”* **\[5.9\].** 

 2. GHWY and Formby have used RE to develop a new model of community\-focused WP. This has helped reach ‘hard\-to\-access’ groups and increased provision through the deployment of a £100,000 community grant for small charities to support learners in their own community space. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **1. Performing a Realist Evaluation of GHWY Uni Connect WP activity to improve access\-to\-HE for underrepresented communities across West Yorkshire** 

 GHWY Uni Connect are a £22million partnership responsible for WP provision in Leeds, Bradford and Wakefield that target 29 wards underrepresented in HE \(focused on years 9\-13; ages 13 and 18\) with over 60 members of staff. Formby has developed an RE that has provided GHWY with a framework that explains why and how interventions work and for whom **\[3.3; 3.4; 3.5\]**. In RE, the principal approach is to engage with ‘process evaluation’ to ascertain the extent an activity has worked \(and the circumstances it has worked within\) with findings fed back into frontline delivery over the course of the initiative. It establishes a series of Programme Theories \(PTs\): statements that indicate how programme activities contribute to outcomes that are then iteratively re\-developed upon realist analysis \(with new additional activity identified\). Formby led on producing substantive progress reports on Phase One that has resulted in new PT development that shaped the overall direction of the GHWY initiative **\[3.3; 3.5\].** Underpinning research indicates how RE has helped GHWY to identify situated circumstances where WP worked across West Yorkshire **\[3.3; 3.4; 3.5\]**. Formby’s most recent contribution has been to assess all Phase One data and develop an analysis that points towards five cornerstone PTs that encompass general areas of activity: ‘Affective and Effective Mentoring’, ‘The ‘Role’ of Role Models’, ‘Experiential Learning’, ‘HE and the Community’ and ‘Realising and Embedding Youth and Learner Voice’ **\[3.5\]**. This has allowed GHWY to move away from focusing on strands of activity, to more ‘middle\-range’ generalizable principles that can be embedded across all activity \(whilst still explaining how and why interventions that worked in one setting can be different elsewhere\). 

 Furthermore, RE is not extensively used in WP evaluation. The development of Formby’s research around developing RE in WP has created an innovative approach that enhances the evidence base of WP through causal explanations as to how, why and who WP works for – not just whether WP activities have worked or not **\[3.5\]**. This not just important for researchers and practitioners in this field but also to open up space for government to reflect on different types of evaluation strategy. All reports and published work **\[3.1; 3.2; 3.3; 3.5\]** have been submitted to the Office for Students \(OfS\) by GHWY as evidence of good practice – both establishing and increasing awareness of Realist Evaluation\-based work in WP at the national level. 

 **2. Embedding ‘Community Outreach Widening Participation’ across West Yorkshire** 

 GHWY Uni Connect has community outreach WP in all 29 ward areas yet such provision is relatively new in the UK. The RE has focused extensively on the efficacy of such approaches, demonstrating the importance of reaching out to under\-represented communities **\[3.1; 3.2\],** especially in terms of frontline staff through notions of ‘social capital’ and ‘sense of place’. Formby performed an RE on the role of outreach staff in institutional **\[3.1\]** and community settings **\[3.2\];** and found that by tapping into the ‘everyday’ social capital and relations that learners inhabit daily, WP becomes transformative in the support it offers to learners. In practice, this entailed building flexible and durable relationships in schools and colleges and the broader community to create holistic, supportive and effective WP **\[3.3\]**. 

 The originality of this research lies in embedding RE – a relatively new evaluation approach – in national WP provision. It has allowed more nuanced accounts of programme initiative and identified different ways of addressing deep\-rooted inequalities around accessing Higher Education in West Yorkshire. Furthermore, this research emphasises how innovative analytical sociological methods create social change in different community contexts **\[3.1; 3.2\]** \- and the need to push past ‘what works/one\-size\-fits\-all’ evaluation paradigms. By considering how, why and the circumstances initiatives work, our RE has explored how relevant sociological theories \(Bourdieu – ‘Social Capitals’; Creswell – ‘Sense of Place’\) intersect with broader contextual considerations \(such as the role of organisational involvement e.g. schools or colleges\) – and explain different WP outcomes **\[3.1; 3.2\].**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In 2015, the UK government identified geographical areas at ward level “where higher education participation is lower than might be expected given the GCSE results of the young people who live there” \(OfS, 2019\). In West Yorkshire, 29 wards were identified as POLAR 3 and POLAR 4 \(participation of local areas\): communities with deep historical barriers in terms of accessing HE. This RE ensured GHWY innovated its WP practices through continuous analysis of activity to identify highly effective and supportive methods that reached out to underrepresented communities. In practice, Formby developed new programme theory that reflected on activity efficacy and best practice, the deployment of resources \(e.g. staff and activities\) and the identification of emergent gaps in the GHWY evidence base. A Senior Project Manager at GHWY explains Formby ‘ *has worked with our research and evaluation team to draw out learning for practitioners from the emerging evidence, helping GHWY to improve our work on an ongoing basis’* **\[5.8\].** This resulted in improved rates of progression to HE within West Yorkshire. Analysis of Higher Education Statistics data indicates that GHWY students have *“a rate of progression to HE of 43%, matching the national average in areas and with students who have previously seen lower than average progression*” **\[5.1\].** 

 Formby embedded RE methodology in a large Uni Connect – government consortia that facilitate WP across England and Wales **\[5.2; 5.3; 5.5; 5.8; 5.9\]** – and demonstrated the overall impact of GHWY to external partners including the OfS **\[5.5\]**. A former research and evaluation manager at GHWY stated: ‘ *upon submission of the OfS phase two report we were commended by OfS for our connections with the academic community’* **\[5.6\].** Modern WP evaluation needs robust approaches that elucidate the circumstances whereby WP activities work. Best practice evaluation by the Widening Participation Research and Evaluation Unit at the University of Sheffield emphasised the positive benefits of the GHWY RE approach as it has enabled “ *a relatively new approach to evaluating outreach*” **\[5.4\].** Similarly **,** South Yorkshire Uni Connect cite GHWY as important in shaping their own WP evaluation approach: *‘the application of realist approaches to programme evaluation in WP is still in its infancy, and the work of Dr Formby and GHWY has offered the sector an example of how the approach can provide us with a means to develop causally focussed explanations of why and how our interventions work and for whom’.* South Yorkshire Uni Connect also cite GHWY and Formby et al. regarding their work on community outreach as influential when considering the introduction of additional WP resources: *‘the work published on the role of recent graduates in setting up and delivering outreach provision has informed HeppSY’s approach to the deployment of our own staff in this regard’* **\[5.10\].** 

 Another significant impact of Formby et al. is the development of *“a robust realist evaluation approach”* that is *“applied across the whole range of the consortia's work”* **\[5.5\].** In particular, the continuous re\-framing of core programme theories is highlighted in OfS evaluation: ‘ *the development of detailed programme theories, which are supplemented by a range of other supporting documents represents a very strong theory of change approach, which is highly commended’* and *‘the level of detail and thinking that is evidenced in this strategy is admirable’* **\[5.5\].** A further consequence of Formby et al.’s research concerned how programme mechanisms differ in relation to the contexts in which they operate. For instance, the introduction of mentoring schemes in different communities across West Yorkshire resulted in divergent mentoring practice \(a distinction between ‘effective and affective’ when mentoring took place in institutional settings or the wider community\) **\[3.5\]**. This focus on the role of ‘context’ as a key explanatory factor in WP evaluation was also noted by the OfS: *‘the realist approach on which you draw is particularly suitable for considering participant context and we commend your research\-informed approach to considering the importance of place as a crucial contextual factor’* **\[5.5\]**. 

 Formby also designed and evaluated multiple realist evaluation\-based initiatives for GHWY around community outreach. Two core projects focused on the role of WP outreach workers both in educational settings and in the community context **\[3.1; 3.2\]**. Findings demonstrated GHWY’s positive progress in engaging under\-represented communities across West Yorkshire e.g. establishing ‘sense of place’ and the use of community ‘role models’ as key mechanisms that break down barriers around accessing HE **\[3.1; 3.2; 5.2; 5.3\]**. Examples of positive impact include the use of local graduates and student ambassadors within community settings \(who we found were best placed to support young people\) and developing activities that took into account the ‘community setting’ itself e.g. localised ‘career\-focused’ housing initiatives, place\-based photography projects or the integration of WP provision with the support of local organisations e.g. sports teams **\[3.2; 5.3\].** Research and Evaluation management at GHWY argue this ‘ *enhanced understandings of the importance of role models and identification in engaging hard\-to\-access groups’* **\[5.7\].** As a result, GHWY expanded community provision across West Yorkshire towards the latter half of Phase One through the £100,000 Community Grants Scheme. This involved small charities providing bespoke WP activity to reach ‘hard\-to\-access’ groups of young people to support integration with future HE trajectory. As explained by the Research and Evaluation Manager at GHWY: *‘the exploratory work of the Outreach Officers – and especially the insights they developed about the importance of building relationships with community groups as an entry point for this work – lead to the development of a substantive Community Grants scheme’* **\[5.7\].** 

 Overall, Formby has sought to support GHWY through the development of an RE that ensures they can meet their aims: to provide high quality WP that supports underrepresented groups of young people to access HE in West Yorkshire. The Research and Evaluation Manager at GHWY emphasises that Formby’s contribution has been *‘instrumental in supporting my team, our wider network of around 60 staff, and colleagues from other partnerships, to understand and effectively apply a Realist Evaluation approach to our widening participation practice \(an innovative approach in this context, for which we have been commended by the Uni Connect national evaluation capability building team\)’* **\[5.7\]**. More broadly, Formby has widened the national evidence base in terms of effective WP activity, as explained GHWY senior management: ‘o *ne of the intended outcomes of the OfS Uni Connect programme is to improve the evidence base for widening participation activity and to improve evaluative practice in the sector. Dr Formby’s contribution, in supporting practitioners \(both WP practitioners and R&E staff\) to undertake evaluation and in helping to analyse and understand the data collected is contributing to both the local and national understanding’* **\[5.8\].** Lastly, the Director of GHWY emphasises that the RE has fostered engagement across the GHWY partnership throughout West Yorkshire: ** **“**as a partnership of diverse HE providers, GHWY’s influence reaches beyond one institution and being at the vanguard of the realist evaluation movement has really supported us in keeping our member organisations engaged with the work of the partnership. The work that Dr Formby started with the Uni Connect Research and Evaluation Team has, through his stewardship, permeated the culture of our organisation: we have embedded Realist Evaluation principles to our widening participation activity, and have informed our partnership’s evidence\-based practice as a result of Dr Formby’s applied approach to academic analysis and development of cornerstone programme theories”* **\[5.9\] **.**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 ‘Forgotten Futures and the City’ is an applied theatre project in dementia care and rehabilitation in prison settings. Malone’s research was adopted in regional care homes \(North West, UK\) and national prison settings \(Novus, UK\) from 2017. The impact of the research is twofold. ‘Forgotten Futures’ has transformed the way drama\-based dementia care is delivered in 16 care homes \(replacing their previous ‘deficit model’, based on lack and deficiency\) in Merseyside and Cheshire. It is also informing the way 52 UK Prisons educate their adult learners \(away from a ‘deficit model’\), whilst locally, ex\-offenders are intending to study at university as a result of Malone’s research. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research belongs to the overall context of the challenge to ‘pharmocotherapy’, which privileges a medicalised conception of the participant over a more enabling conception of the participant as critical and active citizen. Malone’s model of practice contributes to the growth in resistance, in theory and practice, to ‘pharmocotherapy care’ in dementia care in particular, while the model is transferable to prison education. Across both constituencies, Malone’s research and subsequent model is recognised for its therapeutic benefits, fostering a sense of positive, active agency among people living with dementia and adult learners in prison settings. 

 Malone’s research insights and findings were generated from the fact that much drama\-based dementia care provision and drama\-based prison education work depend on a view of the recipient as ‘faulty’ and in need of ‘correction’. Government reports including *Dementia: A state of the nation report on dementia care and support in England*, 2013 and *HM Chief Inspector of Prisons for England and Wales, Annual Report* 2013–14 confirm the general and active use of a deficit model in operation across dementia care and prison education. 

 Drama provision in these areas has mostly followed suit \(output 1\). Malone’s research advocated a beneficiary\-focused approach \(output 1\), then consequently established a user\-friendly model, ‘Forgotten Futures and the City’, from 2015 onwards. This was a direct result of the success of the research in the hands of care home managers and prison employees. This new model proposed an innovative remit for effective drama\-based provision in dementia care. \(Practical support was given by Donna Miles \(née Redgrave\), the co\-author of output 1 and CEO of Memory Matters Ltd. Miles facilitated the logistics of access to workshop spaces in dementia work, but Malone is solely responsible for research insights and findings\). 

 Forgotten Futures advocated an active citizenry \(after Engin Isin \(2008\), i.e. promoting the praxis of active citizenship regardless of political status\). Malone’s research found that ‘Reminiscence theatre’ tends to fixate on the participant as ‘faulty’, corrected by pharmacotherapy \(output 1\), whereas Malone’s model recognises the participant as an already full and active citizen. Malone built further upon these insights in output 2, showing the importance of re\-defining agency and recuperating people living with dementia as social actors through reflection on case studies, including Forgotten Futures. In particular, it was argued that practitioners should resist models based largely around reminiscence and incorporate imaginary projection, embracing the unpredictable, uncertainty and ‘imaginative wonderings’. Memory thus becomes a creative act with an emphasis on future\-focus and relational well\-being. 

 From 2015\-2020, 26 apprentices \(trained by Malone between 2015\-2020\) facilitated Malone’s model across dementia care provision in the North West of England, thus increasing capacity for the model to be taken up regionally and nationally. This model was then applied to prison education after an approach from Sarah Hartley \(National Lead for Families, Novus\) in March 2018, after Malone’s Tate Liverpool presentation of research findings in dementia care. This was then adapted to a model drawn up across 52 HMPs in the UK, deploying the theoretical terrain covered in output 1.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research is user\- and beneficiary\-focused and belongs to the growing field of alternative solutions to pharmacotherapy care in dementia and prisons using applied drama. The impact of the research is demonstrated in how the structures of the use of applied drama workshops in dementia care and prison settings has changed as a result of Malone’s research, supported by the subsequent apprenticeship programme she delivered from 2015\-2020. Malone’s research has introduced novel ways of workshopping with participants in dementia care and in prison settings, specifically by intervening theoretically and practically in the structures already present in those constituency groups, which normalised the ‘faulty’ \(or ‘deficit model’\) approach to both dementia care and rehabilitation in applied drama. 

 Malone structured the impact of the research over a five\-year period with strategic decisions culminating in care home managers claiming the impact on their practices to have been ‘fundamental’ *“It has made a fundamental change to how to do things here\!”* \(Section 5 A\). Malone disseminated the research \(Output 1\) at several community and national events in 2015\-20, most relevantly this included Malone’s invitation to care home managers to two week\-long residencies at TATE Liverpool as part of the TATE Exchange National Programme 2018 and 2019. These residencies were designed by Malone to prioritise collaboration between 16 emerging artists \(selected from the Merseyside region\) and people living and working with dementia on the basis of reimagining city cultures through applied drama in care homes. The impression of these events facilitated a deeper and more lasting impact on people working with dementia “ *The Tate event was amazing. It was so lovely to see our residents’ voices being heard in such an important gallery. I personally was shocked at how popular the Forgotten Futures and the City model was becoming. It really gave us a lift to implement it in our workplaces”* \(Section 5 B\), where, according to TATE Liverpool, 11,337 people attended Malone’s event in total \(Section 5 H\). Malone, in June 2017, in partnership with Donna Miles \(née Redgrave\) of Memory Matters Theatre Company and designed and delivered a ‘Training Day for Carers’ to integrate the model into their workplaces. Carers from 9 different nursing homes attended \(32 carers in all\), were given copies of Malone’s research \(output 1\) and were introduced to *The Forgotten Futures and the City* model of practice, especially how the model could be utilised in the workplace. To date all 9 care homes now regularly deploy Malone’s model *“It has totally transformed the way we work with dementia. Your model of getting them all engaged in the future of the city has worked wonders. The levels of engagement have been great. I’ve never seen them so engaged. It really has transformed their arts sessions here at the care home”* \(Section 5 C\). 

 Dating back to the TATE Exchange programme in 2018 and 2019, a working partnership was established with Sarah Hartley \- National Lead for Families, Novus \(social enterprise solely responsible for educational programmes in the UKs 52 HMPs\). This partnership resulted in Malone developing and publishing the findings of her research into a user\-friendly manual for educators in UK HMP settings \(‘Forgotten Futures and the City: A MANUAL for the use of arts intervention in prisons and other rehabilitation settings’.

 Subsequently, the project ran successfully in 2019 and 2020, engaging with the Novus team \(around 20 educator employees\) and approx. 30 adult learners in prison settings. The key findings of the research were disseminated via the manual for educators in HMP settings and disseminated \(via Novus\) to all 52 HMPs in the UK and through the National Criminal Justice Arts Alliance Organisation \(https://www.clinks.org/node/2215\) where there has been take up of key ideas and practices, especially in the North West of England, “ *Influenced by Dr Malone’s research we advocate an approach which focuses on the individual as a critical, proactive citizen. The project is future\-orientated and works as part of the offenders’ rehabilitation programme. The impact of a manual which is made available to all 52 of our prisons, explaining how to implement the model, is a significant contribution to developing prison curricula and education goals”*, \(Section 5 D\). Adult learners in prison settings have approached Malone and her apprentices, expressing desire to study at university level after the successful completion of the course that Malone ran in two North West prisons in 2019 and 2020 “ *On release, 1 of our participants have said they will apply to university to find out more about his options to study.”* \(Section 5 E\). One prisoner upon release contacted Malone directly \(with permission\) to ask for help in getting into higher education in November 2020 and February 2021 *“\[…\] this might sound crazy but thanks to you and the course at HMP XXXXX, I’m going to start my Philosophy journey studying The Philosophy of Psychedelics. I'm OK still adjusting to life outside of prison while trying to be a dad as well. I am going to apply \[to university\] this year. I'm looking forward to it. Yes I do need help applying as well can you help. I'm going to apply for the Philosophy, Religion and Ethics. I have already started preparing for my start this is really big for me. Thanks*” Section 5 F\). Spoken testimonies from adult learner participants “ *Doing this course makes me feel like I’m part of the world, that I’ve got a place in it, not just that I messed up once or twice and I deserve to be in here*.’ \(Section 5 G\) in Malone’s Forgotten Future’s project 2019\-2020 also testify to the success in the domain of beneficiary\-focussed research being applied in the prison setting with offenders. The impact here is ongoing, but initial data indicates potential engagement with higher level education, something which promises, at this point, to have a positive impact on rehabilitation and reoffender figures.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 **Attribution:** Research into viral evolution during epidemics by University of Edinburgh scientist Andrew Rambaut has guided the response to the Ebola Zaire outbreak in Western Africa and the global SARS\-CoV\-2 \(Covid\-19\) pandemic. 

 **Impact on public policy, health and welfare:** Rambaut’s research into real\-time genomic epidemiology, in partnership with his development of improved BEAST software and his involvement in international efforts on viral sequencing have had major impacts on public health policy and service provision. 

 **Beneficiaries:** Public agencies such as health bodies World Health Organisation, Centre for Disease Control, Science Advisory Group for Emergencies and governments \(UK, Guinea, New Zealand\) have relied on Rambaut’s software and expertise in genomic epidemiology to develop responses to viral outbreaks. Ultimately, the most significant beneficiaries are the national and global populations subject to infectious disease outbreaks in which BEAST and Rambaut’s expertise are used to inform the response. 

 **Significance and Reach:** The BEAST software and Rambaut’s research into real time genetic epidemiology have been used to understand the spread of, and to inform the policy and health service response to viral outbreaks worldwide.  They are used to determine disease origin and transmission issues in specific situations, and the information is used to inform policy decisions that impact the health of millions. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Rambaut’s interest in phylogenetics of viruses started during his Wellcome\-funded PhD, via one of the earliest grants on using virus pathogens genomes to reconstruct epidemiology. During the PhD, Rambaut created software for analyzing virus sequences that have been sampled over time on very short time spans. This marked a paradigm shift from phylogenetic analysis on timescales for animal evolution over billions of years to reconstructing the processes that create phylogenetic trees from virus samples over the timescale of an epidemic. Following on from the success of the concept and initial software development, the kernel of BEAST was released in 2003 and has been continually updated ever since. 

 BEAST is software for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences related by an evolutionary tree. It analyses gene sequence data from viruses to investigate their evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics. Information about the timing and spatial location of epidemics can be traced and the rate of epidemiological spread can be measured from a relatively small sample of isolates from the population of infected individuals \[3.1\]. BEAST was used in the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa to determine the pathways of viral spread through communities \[3.2\]. 

 Specifically, Rambaut’s research showed how virus spread from Freetown to multiple districts throughout Sierra Leone and how virus traffic from Freetown established new transmission clusters late in the epidemic \[3.3\]. It revealed co\-circulation of multiple lineages within individual localities as well as cross\-border virus traffic between Guinea and Sierra Leone highlighting important gaps in intervention \[3.4\]. Finally, it revealed that virus can persist in seminal fluid for at least 500 days and remain infectious during the long term persistence \[3.5\], all of which had significant impact on management of the outbreak. 

 BEAST, and Rambaut’s research into rapid viral evolution have been used \(by the Rambaut group and others\) extensively throughout the SARS\-CoV\-2 pandemic to establish epidemiological models. Rambaut established that there were several SARS\-CoV\-2 lineages and developed a terminology system to support dissemination \[3.6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Rambaut’s work on viral evolution, evidenced by the development of his BEAST software, has guided public response to several viral outbreaks in the REF period. BEAST has been under continued development to ensure that its relevance increases, with improvements to user\-friendliness within the review period. 

 Rambaut has guided the development of policy on sequence sharing globally with the goal of open sharing of viral sequence data, while ensuring appropriate accreditation and ownership of sequence intellectual property \[5.1, 5.2\]. This hinges on the ARTIC network \[5.1, 5.3, and 5.4\]: a large Wellcome Trust\-funded project that links together diverse viral genome sequencing capabilities throughout the world. Serving as a repository of key protocols and services, ARTIC uses virus sequencing in combination with BEAST to respond to outbreaks in real time \( [http://artic.network](http://artic.network/)\). It is frequently used by WHO to provide sequencing capabilities in pandemic and epidemic situations \[5.1\] 

####  Impact on Health Policy: 

 While Rambaut’s work during the REF period was associated with the response to Influenza, Ebola, Zika and SARS\-CoV\-2, the majority of impact is associated with the Ebola Pandemic in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia \[5.1, 5.2\], and COVID\-19 \[5.1\]. 

 The 2014 – 2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was of unprecedented magnitude. WHO declared a public health emergency in August 2014 and the epidemic that followed resulted in 28,616 documented cases and 11,310 deaths in 3 countries. 

 Prior to this outbreak, genomic studies of infectious disease outbreaks were retrospective: 2013 was the first time that genomic data was used in real time to inform policies and infection control in a public health setting \[5.1, 5.2\]. High throughput next\-generation sequencing enabled rapid and in\-depth viral genome surveillance during the outbreak. Ian Goodfellow, a collaborator of Rambaut set up a ‘lab in a suitcase’ \(based around the Oxford Nanopore minION sequencer\) in Guinea and Sierra Leone to sequence viruses in the field, providing the sequence data that Rambaut’s lab then analysed for phylogenetic analysis with a turn\-around time of 24\-48 hours \[5.1, 5.2\]. Analyses of the molecular sequence data was performed by Rambaut and informed public health bodies \(WHO, CDC\) in West Africa at the time of the Ebola epidemic. The data revealed the pathways of viral spread through communities and was used to direct intervention methods to transmission hot spots and to determine the impact of specific interventions \[5.1, 5.2\]. 

 The analyses using BEAST determined whether a new case of Ebola came from a new hidden transmission chain or a known transmission chain or from an individual infected months previously. The response by public health officials differed depending on this information *e.g.* contact tracing, running a vaccine trial. As a result of the published analyses \[ *e.g.* 3.5\], there is now longer term follow up of Ebola survivors and they are counselled with this new information \[5.1\]. New guidelines from WHO were introduced in January 2016 \[5.5\]. 

 The **coronavirus** pandemic has had an unprecedented worldwide impact on health and the economy, with 74,763,331 confirmed cases and 1,659,570 deaths as of 17<sup>th</sup> Dec, 2020. Mitigation strategies to reduce spread and track infections have been heavily reliant on viral genome sequencing. Internationally, much of the policy based around the WHO’s response to the virus and the sharing policy adopted by the global community to provide genome sequences allowing tracking of the virus has been directly influenced by Rambaut’s work \[5.1\]. 

 Rambaut’s research has had a direct impact on UK and worldwide policy in response to the coronavirus epidemic. Rambaut is a member of the SAGE committee and has been providing evidence to SAGE regarding the transmission rate and consequences of importing the virus into the UK \[5.6\]. His work was specifically referenced in terms of the UK’s policy for border control in response to coronavirus, as described in the Hansard report for the parliament’s response to the pandemic \[5.7\], which describes the development of the international travel restrictions and their impact on national spread of the virus. Rambaut’s models of genetic phylogeny were used in the Imperial College Model for the spread of coronavirus in the UK \[5.8\]. 

 Internationally, Rambaut’s group was the first to demonstrate the rapid spread and evolution of the virus in China, showing that it had been circulating for a shorter time than previously estimated. His work contributed to discrediting the ‘lab\-origin’ theory for coronavirus \[5.6\]. His work has had substantial international impact: Rambaut’s research is specifically mentioned in SitRep 3 from the WHO’s Novel Coronavirus \(2019\-nCoV\) task force \[5.9\]. His work feeds directly into the epidemiology modelling group at the WHO. His research is specifically referenced in three European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control’s reports: “Outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome associated with a novel coronavirus, China: first local transmission in the EU/EEA”, updates 1\-3. His research recommending the classification of coronavirus into distinct phylogenetic lineages \[3.6\] has been used by ESR in New Zealand to help develop responses to the virus \[5.10\]. Finally, his leadership of the ARTIC network \[5.3, 5.1\] resulted in development of internationally accepted protocols for the sequencing of SARS\-CoV\-2 RNA \[5.1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Community Health Workers \(CHWs\) are central to primary health care delivery in low\-income countries. In partnership with Makerere School of Public Health \(MakSPH\), NTU’s Gibson led research into the design, development, evaluation and optimisation of new CHW clinical training programmes in Uganda. Addressing barriers of limited training opportunities and low morale, Gibson’s research\-led interventions upskilled the health workforce, improving CHW retention and competency in treating childhood illnesses, and significantly widened access to health care services. The programmes resulted in the delivery of health care to more than 215,000 people in underserved communities who previously had no access to community health services, and more than 25,000 children under five years of age were newly treated for illnesses including diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria. A follow\-on, award\-winning project enhanced antimicrobial stewardship and improved clinical practice and governance, with stakeholders reporting that the CHW programme as a whole had strengthened the wider Ugandan health system. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The World Health Organisation recognises CHWs as key to the effective delivery of primary health care services in low\- and middle\-income countries. CHWs receive training in a range of preventive and curative health services and are linked into recognised health facilities, enabling them to act as a bridge between formal service providers and underserved communities. In 2001 the Ugandan Government established a national CHW programme as part of its Uganda National Minimum Health Care Package, which aimed to ensure every village in the country could mobilise individuals and households for improved health outcomes. 

 A five\-year research programme \(2014\-2018\) led by Gibson in partnership with MakSPH constituted the first study \(with three phases of baseline research, intervention and evaluation\) designed to improve the CHW programme in Uganda, focusing on village communities in Wakiso, the country’s second most populous district. Exploratory work began in 2012 through a £5,000 start\-up grant from the Tropical Health and Education Trust \(THET\), a global health organisation that trains and supports health workers, and DFID. Having established a formal Memorandum of Understanding between NTU and MakSPH, Gibson’s initial needs assessment found that the CHW programme required a fundamental restructuring. This resulted in the first full THET/DFID grant \[ **G1**\], supported by the Ugandan Ministry of Health, to strengthen the CHW programme across Ssisa sub\-county, a semi\-rural community of 64 villages in Wakiso District. 

 Gibson’s research identified gaps in the Government’s CHW strategy. The baseline research \[ **R1**\] identified that CHWs: 1\) were not provided with ongoing training on how to diagnose and treat childhood illnesses including diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria; 2\) CHWs worked voluntarily with no formal recognition and incentives, which led to low morale; 3\) CHWs received minimal refresher training and supervision. Although CHWs received training at initiation and were expected to conduct home visits for health education and treatment of childhood illnesses, their interventions were limited by out of stock medicines, inaccessible public transport and lack of basic resources \(e.g. gumboots, raincoats\) \[ **R2**\]. Despite 98.5% of CHWs stating that being motivated was an important element of their work, only 45% said they felt motivated \[ **R2**\]. 

 Using the baseline research, the intervention and evaluation phases delivered tailored training to 301 CHWs, making it more bespoke to the roles they were being asked to perform. The interventions were co\-designed by Gibson, MakSPH researchers and local health practitioners to ensure they were culturally appropriate and research\-led \[ **R3**\]. The research had identified structural barriers that were preventing CHWs from performing a core role within the primary healthcare system; this included an investigation of the barriers to early detection of breast cancer \[ **R4**\]. Specialised training in rapid diagnostics testing and safe handling and administration of medicines for diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria in children was delivered to 75 CHWs. Leadership and management training were provided to 24 CHW supervisors \[ **R3**\]. The intervention phase provided gumboots, raincoats and solar equipment to enable CHWs to visit homes in any weather conditions. It also provided three motorcycles used by supervisors to augment the training component, increasing the availability of essential medicines and access to supervision for CHWs in the field \[ **R3**\]. 

 Having significantly widened access to health care via CHWs for the local population, Gibson was awarded follow\-on research funding \[ **G2**\] to scale up the new CHW programme to three other sub\-counties in Wakiso and ensure its long\-term sustainability by designing a ‘train the trainer’ model. A total of 222 CHWs and 34 CHW supervisors from the new sub\-counties were trained, in addition to 263 CHWs and 24 CHW supervisors from Ssisa who received further training \[ **R5**\]. As a result of the successful scale up of the CHW programme, Gibson was awarded funding by the Fleming Fund \[ **G3**\], a £265m UK aid programme managed by the Department of Health, to co\-design a training programme on antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention and control. Part of the Commonwealth Partnership for Antimicrobial Stewardship \(CwPAMS\), and undertaken with MakSPH, Entebbe Hospital and Buckinghamshire NHS trust, training was delivered to 86 qualified health professionals and 227 CHWs in the Busiro South Health Sub District in Wakiso \[ **R6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 New CHW training programmes shaped by the NTU research have upskilled a key part of the Ugandan health workforce, significantly widened access to primary health care services in a district of two million people and strengthened antimicrobial stewardship. These impacts would not have happened without the research conducted collaboratively with MakSPH and seen as a ‘ *model Health Partnership*’ by THET \[ **S1**\]. 

 **Widening access to primary health care services and treatment for communicable childhood illnesses in underserved and hard\-to\-reach communities in Uganda** 

 The research\-led CHW training programme \[ **G1**, **G2**\] upskilled 523 CHWs across the four Wakiso sub\-counties of Ssisa, Kasanje, Katabi and Bussi between 2014 and the end of 2018, widening access to healthcare for 216,620 people and resulting in 26,158 young children being treated for illnesses \[ **S1**\]. There was a focus on reaching underserved and hard\-to\-reach communities; for example, Bussi is a typically neglected island community and the programme was targeted at women and people living with disabilities. NTU’s research has revitalised the CHW framework, transforming it from a failing service into a structured programme capable of fulfilling its original mandate of providing health education and treating childhood illnesses across wide population areas in rural communities \[ **S1**\- **S5, S10**\]. This is demonstrated by the outcomes from the first phase of the programme \[ **G1**\] in which 301 CHWs were trained: 

-  The number of people receiving education from CHWs relating to communicable diseases and healthy practices increased from a baseline figure of 1,327 to 127,011 \(Male: 44%; Female: 56%\) in April 2017 \[ **S1**, **S2**\]. 

-  The number of household visits that CHWs made for health promotion and treatment purposes increased from a baseline of 369 to 40,213 in April 2017 \[ **S1**, **S2**\]. 

-  The training of CHWs in rapid diagnostics testing and administration of essential medicines increased treatment of children under five years of age from 78 at baseline to 19,387 in April 2017 \[ **S1**, **S2**\]. 

 At the end of the first phase, the Chairperson of Wakiso District said the community of Ssisa sub\-county had ‘ *observed improvement in their health status*’ and called for the project interventions to be ‘ *scaled up to other areas so as to further support the work of the Ministry of Health*’ \[ **S3**\]. The resulting scale\-up programme \[ **G2**\] engaged 485 CHWs \(222 from the new sub\-counties\) and 58 CHW supervisors \(34 from the new sub\-counties\). Key outcomes included: 

-  In just six months \(June to November 2018\), the number of people newly receiving health education from CHWs was 130,608 \(Male: 44%; Female: 56%\), including 89,609 from the three new sub\-counties \[ **S3**\]. 

-  Over the same period, CHWs involved in integrated community case management of childhood illnesses treated 8,895 children, including 6,771 in the new areas \[ **S3**\]. 

-  CHWs sensitised 530 people with disabilities on health issues \[ **S3**\]. 

 THET reported a fall in cases of childhood illnesses as a result of increased access to treatment provided by CHWs. It said: ‘ *As a result of the training which the CHWs had received, they \(health clinic staff\) were seeing less of the easily treatable childhood cases of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea, and could focus their time more on treating more serious cases’* \[ **S1**\]. 

 Qualitative evidence from local stakeholders also demonstrates the benefits delivered to rural communities. The Chairperson of Wakiso District commented: ‘ *During the course of the project, the CHWs became very active and were visible in the entire sub\-county. In fact, some even came to my home and sensitised me on pertinent health issues. Can you imagine a CHW health educating a whole district governor and providing me with information I did not know about?’* \[ **S3**\]. One community member said the treatment of their grandchildren by CHWs had saved them money and time spent travelling many miles to the nearest hospital \[ **S2**\]. A local councillor said he was ‘ *happy and surprised*’ at the resourcefulness displayed by the CHWs in his own village \[ **S3**\]. One person living with a disability said: ‘ *I am so happy for the training we received as people with disabilities as it has never happened to have someone gathering us together for health issues. We are only remembered by politicians during election time’* \[ **S3**\]. 

 **Upskilling and motivating the community health workforce through new training programmes and proactive knowledge exchange** 

 Three months after completing the first phase of the new training programme \[ **G1**\], 98% of CHWs \(from a baseline of zero\) reported that they felt ‘very competent’ \(68%\) or ‘competent’ \(30%\) to carry out their work among the community, having demonstrated adequate knowledge and skills in their face\-to\-face interactions \[ **S2**\]. A final evaluation at the end of **G2**, involving 485 CHWs, showed that 97.5% of CHWs met the competency criteria for a range of health interventions, including the diagnosis and management of malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia \[ **S3**\]. CHWs who felt motivated to carry out the work rose from 46.6% to 71.1% \[ **S3**\]. One health centre worker commented that the training programme had ‘ *greatly changed the status of CHWs in this part of the district*’ \[ **S3**\]. THET \[ **S1**\] highlighted the training programme’s multiplier effect: ‘ *The community groups educated by the village health teams have improved not just their own attitudes to health and hygiene, but have passed this information on to their peers, their children, and their husbands*.’ 

 As a result of the project, a male CHW supervisor from the Uganda programme was invited to speak at the 2017 THET conference in London \(other speakers included a UK government minister, the UK Chief Medical Officer and WHO’s Director General\) and to shadow community health organisations in Nottingham. He said the experience had been a key factor in his subsequent promotion from CHW supervisor to district coordinator \[ **S6**\]. A female CHW from the Uganda programme was invited to present at the International Health Conference in Oxford in 2019 and interact with community organisations in Nottingham \[ **S6**\]. 

 **Strengthening health systems and embedding antimicrobial stewardship** 

 The NTU\-led CwPAMS project \[ **G3**\] to strengthen antimicrobial stewardship \(AMS\) was carried out in Busiro South Health Sub District \(comprising three Wakiso town councils and one sub\-county\), where a high number of households are engaged in poultry and livestock farming in which antimicrobials are used extensively. Using a One Health approach, 86 health practitioners \(HPs\), including animal health workers, and 227 CHWs were trained, and around 300 primary schools were sensitised on AMR, AMS and infection prevention and control. The quantitative impact data is corroborated by the peer\-reviewed evaluative study in **R6**. Three months after the training, 92.2% of HPs and 90.3% of CHWs reported enhanced practices, including increased handwashing \(57.3% and 81.0% respectively\), and 51.5% of HPs reported a reduction in the quantity of unnecessary antibiotics per patient \[ **R6**\]. Sixty\-nine CHWs reported having each educated 50\-100 community members on AMR, while 27 \(12%\) reached over 100 \[ **R6**\]. Improved prescription practices among HPs led to improved availability of antimicrobials. One health worker at Bussi health centre said: ‘ *I do not just give out antibiotics anymore. For this reason, I am now able to save amoxicillin tablets for patients who really need them, and I also give out the medication in the right dose. This has helped me reduce on the number of times I go to look for medicines from other facilities due to reduced stock\-outs at my facility*’ \[ **R6**\]. 

 Working closely with pharmacists at the 200\-bed Entebbe Hospital and Buckinghamshire NHS Trust, the research team established a Medicine and Therapeutics Committee \(MTC\) was set up at Entebbe Hospital in 2019; this resulted in the development of guidelines and protocols for safe prescription and administration of antibiotics \[ **S7**, **S8**\]. An unanticipated impact of the MTC came during the Covid\-19 pandemic; it was instrumental in Entebbe’s hospital emergency preparedness and response as it developed Standard Operating Procedures for Covid\-19 management. Entebbe Hospital was the first facility in the country to handle Covid\-19 cases and its director reported that without the MTC and the CwPAMS project as a whole, ‘ *the hospital would not have been well prepared to respond adequately to the pandemic’* \[ **S7**\]. 

 The CwPAMs project and its partners were successful at the 2020 Antibiotic Guardian Awards, run by Public Health England. The CwPAMS project won the ‘multi\-country collaboration’ and ‘infection prevention and control’ awards; NTU was highly commended for the ‘innovation and technology’ award; a partner on the project, a Buckinghamshire NHS Trust pharmacist, won an AMS memorial award \[ **S9**\]. The project also had a sustained impact on Buckinghamshire NHS Trust. Three of the Trust’s pharmacists strengthened their leadership skills and, as a result of CwPAMS, all completed the first Chief Pharmaceutical Officer’s Global Health Fellowship \(16 fellows in total\) \[ **S8**\]. 

 All of the projects \[ **G1**\- **G3**\] have contributed to a strengthening of the wider health system in Uganda. A Ministry of Health commissioner said: ‘ *Your partnership approach in strengthening the national CHWs programme in Uganda is highly valued and appreciated. We will continue to support your work in supporting the community health system in Uganda’* \[ **S10**\]. A Wakiso District Health Officer commented: ‘ *… this project … has benefited not only the CHWs but the entire health system of Wakiso district because when these motivated CHWs perform and report better, it is the district at large which benefits’* \[ **S3**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UCL’s Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave\-ownership \( **LBS**\) has informed and led evidence\-based discussions about the impact of colonial slavery on British society, economics, and culture. Nationally and internationally, LBS has engaged media professionals and wide public audiences in ongoing debates about slavery, economic accumulation, national identity and race through its open access website \(including a searchable database\), award\-winning documentary, co\-production and outreach activities. Underpinning discussions and policy\-making within governmental bodies and financial institutions on the subject of reparations for slavery, LBS research and collaboration have also provided innovative pedagogic tools for schoolteachers and pupils. They have changed curatorial practises in cultural and heritage organisations such as Tate Britain, fostering the public display of new narratives of race and nation in contemporary Britain. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 LBS research combines quantitative data and qualitative analysis in a body of work that re\-inscribes slavery in historical understanding of the formation of modern Britain. Launched in February 2013, the project’s major outputs, including its open access website and embedded searchable database \( [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/)\) \( **R1**\), have documented awards of compensation made by Parliament to 46,000 slave\-owners following the abolition of slavery in 1833 and traced their wider legacies in Britain. In 2014, LBS research extended to track slave\-ownership in the British Caribbean from c.1763 to abolition in 1833. Between 2014 and December 2020 the database was updated, adding 16,000 new individuals to the known universe of Caribbean slave\-owners and new data on 7,300 Caribbean estates \(each with 15 or more enslaved people\). 

 Nationally, the dominant understanding of Britain’s involvement in slavery has been that Britain was the first country to abolish the slave trade and the first to abolish slavery—an interpretation that has highlighted British commitment to liberal values including racial equality. LBS data and publications have fundamentally disrupted that pervasive narrative by demonstrating 1\) the wide scope of British investment in slave labour from the 1760s to the 1830s and 2\) the extent to which this engagement pervaded and shaped society, culture, identities and economics in Britain beyond emancipation. A major monograph co\-authored by the project team, *Legacies of British Slave\-ownership* \( **R2**\), comprehensively analyses LBS’s database of British slave\-owners and mortgagees who received state compensation for the end of slavery. Chapters by Draper show that up to 10% of British elites directly benefitted from slave\-ownership, revealing that wealth deriving from slave\-ownership was a significant stream in banking, finance, agrarian growth and industrial development. Chapters by Donington, Hall and McClelland demonstrate that the “legacies” of this slave\-ownership flowed into British commerce, politics, philanthropy, fine art collection and the built environment even as Britons worked to conceal their longstanding association with Caribbean slavery. These legacies continue to mark 21<sup>st</sup>\-century corporations, educational institutions, museums and heritage sites, shaping public understandings of race and nation in contemporary Britain \( **R2**\), \( **R3**\). 

 The LBS database \( **R1**\) showed the pervasive presence of slave\-owners across Britain not only in areas where they might be expected – London, Bristol, Liverpool – but also in areas with apparently little direct connection with the slavery business — such as Newcastle\-upon\-Tyne and north\-east England, Exeter, Devon and Pembrokeshire. The database also revealed the disproportionately large numbers of slave\-owners in Scotland, discussed by Draper in \( **R4**\). Draper’s chapter, “British Universities and Caribbean Slavery,” also examines the links between universities, “faculty members” and students as slave\-owners to demonstrate how debts to slavery are embedded within UK higher education institutions \( **R3**\). 

 Hall’s work has led to new understandings of the history of race in Britain. Her case study of Archibald Alison \(in **R5**\) shows that pro\-slavery discourse was part of a wider set of attitudes to race and the social order, nation, class and empire. Hall’s chapter in \( **R2**\) demonstrates the ways in which compensated slave\-owners wrote slave\-ownership out of their family narratives while producing highly racialised narratives of British society, culture and empire.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 LBS research has enriched and transformed evidence\-based public debate around Britain’s historic and ongoing debt to slavery. Changing the terms of that debate, LBS’s open access website and database have also expanded the range of its participants and audiences. By disrupting abolition of the slave trade in 1807 and of slavery in 1833 as, respectively, the focal point and the end point of Britain’s relationship to Caribbean slavery, LBS has challenged dominant understandings of Britons’ longstanding commitment to liberal values such as racial equality. This work has encouraged a wide range of stakeholders to acknowledge slavery’s profound and enduring effects on modern and contemporary Britain. Working with media, policy\-makers, cultural organisations, charities, educational professionals and students, LBS has stimulated new thinking about race, nation and inequality in Britain. 

 **Raising awareness of Britain’s relationship to slavery:** LBS’s award\-winning website and underlying database \( **R1**\) has been a powerful tool for research by, and engagement with, public stakeholders in the media, including social media. 1,759,811 website users in 224 countries or territories accessed this online resource between 1 August 2013 and 31 December 2020, an average of over 20,000 users per month \( **A**\). Journalists, broadcasters and members of the public have extensively used \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\) to inform, report and participate in public debates on slavery, wealth and race in Britain. Peaks in website use that follow specific current events and/or media publications that draw upon LBS research have repeatedly attested to LBS resources’ broader utility for enhancing public understanding of the past. In partnership with film\-maker David Olusoga and the BBC, the LBS team made *Britain’s Forgotten Slave\-owners*, a 2\-part television programme first broadcast in 2015. Inspired by and based on LBS’s research in \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\), this programme revealed to an initial audience of \[TEXT REDACTED\] how modern Britain was built on the profits of slavery. Its July 2015 broadcast led to a spike in LBS website engagement with 227,000 users accessing \( **R1**\) that month \(compared to 6,692 in June\), demonstrating viewers’ active appetite for LBS research. The programme won the 2015 Royal Historical Society Public History Prize for Broadcasting and the 2016 Specialist Factual BAFTA award. The RHS judges commended the series for tackling “an extremely difficult subject in a measured way by showcasing new historical research,” noting that it “explains the complex economics of slavery and encourages viewers to take a better informed and more critical stance on current economic issues” \( **A**\). 

 LBS’s role in engaging and informing public understanding of the past was especially significant during British debates about statues commemorating slave\-traders and slave\-owners and the wider international Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. The LBS database \( **R1**\) and television programme \(featured on BBC iPlayer in July 2020 and still available\) were major resources informing public discussions of Britain’s relationship to slavery. Users of \( **R1**\) rose to 322,000 in June 2020 \(compared to 24,000 in May\). LBS findings were drawn on in social media, the press, and broadcasting to support arguments about individuals’ and institutions’ involvement in slavery and reveal how the legacies of slavery continue to underpin national and racial identities and experiences in Britain today. In the week following 7 June and the toppling in Bristol of the Victorian statue of the slave\-trader Edward Colston, the biggest sources of traffic to \( **R1**\) were the 74,589 referrals via Twitter and Facebook. Tweets highlighting the insights offered by the LBS database garnered substantial interactions and drove traffic to the site as the public were prompted to learn more. Booker Prize winning novelist Bernadine Evaristo shared the website and encouraged followers “To find out how slavery shaped Britain \[…\]. Enter names & you get the FACTS of post\-slavery compensation for many recognisable institutions/companies/ families who flourish today” \(435 retweets, 766 likes\). A London\-based community organiser created a thread of tweets that drew directly upon, and linked to, \( **R1**\) to highlight slave\-ownership within the ancestry of the political establishment \(over 6,200 retweets, 15,000 likes\) \( **B**\). 

 Nationally and internationally, journalists relied upon LBS research, especially \( **R1**\), to inform their reports and interpretations of BLM. In Britain alone, 26 national newspaper articles used LBS research \( **R1**\) between 7 June and 15 August 2020, including prominent articles in the *Daily Telegraph*, the *Guardian*, the *Observer*, the *Financial* *Times*, and the *Daily* *Mail* online. The *Guardian* articles were shared by online users 23,761 times. Many articles that appeared in the national press, particularly in Scotland, cited LBS research: there were 27,007 referrals to the website \( **R1**\) in these weeks. This period also saw at least 58 international news articles cite LBS research, including in *Le* *Monde* \(France\), the *New* *York* *Times* \(USA\), and *Yomiuri* *Shimbun* \(the biggest selling newspaper in Japan\). Two programmes on CBS TV and one on CNN Business featuring McClelland led to a spike in interest in \( **R1**\) in the USA. In the week beginning 9 August, there were more users in the USA \(7,111\) than in Britain \(6,002\) – the first time in the project’s history that British users were outnumbered by those from elsewhere. 

 **Reparation debates and policies:** LBS has had a palpable impact on national and international debates around the role and responsibilities of intergovernmental organisations, states, financial institutions, and universities with respect to slavery and reparations. Internationally, its research has been central to the debate over reparations among the 15 Caribbean states and dependencies within CARICOM, an organisation promoting economic integration and cooperation. The sustained campaign for reparations led by Chairman of the CARICOM Reparations Commission Sir Hilary Beckles, publicly credited as “the chief spokesman of a global movement for racial justice” \( **C**\), has drawn heavily on LBS work in mounting the case for reparations: in 2015 he “credited Draper’s research with shaping much of his own book \[ *Britain’s Black Debt*\],” which “lays out the Caribbean case for reparations” \( **C**\). In 2018, the UN commissioned Draper as an author of \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\) to write a report, *Some Potential Lessons from the British Financial Sector's Role in Perpetuating and Ending Chattel Slavery* \( **D**\). This provided historical background for the Financial Sector Commission’s development in 2019 of an “Implementation Toolkit,” a set of practical tools and initiatives to accelerate action by the sector in combatting this modern USD150,000,000,000 industry affecting 40,300,000 people. In June 2020, the Bank of England apologised for the involvement of some of its past governors and directors in the slave trade, and pledged to remove all statues and paintings of them from public display in its headquarters. Reports of this decision, such as in the *Financial Times* \(19 June 2020\), explicitly linked LBS to the Bank’s decision. In 2020 Greene King, one of the largest of the UK’s pub chains and Lloyd's of London, the insurance firm, both committed to pay large sums to Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic \(BAME\) communities after their roles in the slave trade were highlighted by *Daily Telegraph* investigations using \( **R1,R4**\). Responding to LBS research, five universities—Bristol, Cambridge, Glasgow, Nottingham and Nottingham Trent—have investigated their historical links with slavery, an imperative articulated in \( **E**\). As *The Economist* reported in 2020, LBS research “has been critical in pushing institutions, in higher education and beyond, to look into how they benefited from slavery and the slave economy.” The University of Glasgow’s 2018 report, “Slavery, Abolition and the University of Glasgow,” makes 37 references to \( **R1**\). It resulted in the university’s 2019 commitment to establishing a Glasgow\-Caribbean Centre for Development Research with the University of the West Indies, investing £20 million over the next 20 years \( **E**\). 

 **Impacts on Schools, Pupils and Teachers:** LBS research has made a significant contribution to school\-teaching through the development of new pedagogic materials, co\-produced with pupils and teachers, and public engagement activities with UK archives, schools and charities.  With Hackney Archives and two local schools, LBS implemented the Local Roots/Global Routes project in 2015, which facilitated the co\-creation of a Key Stage 3 resource concerning the historic links between Hackney and transatlantic slavery. This was clearly a transformative experience for pupils of African\-Caribbean heritage: one student told LBS that taking part “was for me mental reparations; it repaired me mentally.” In 2015 and 2016, LBS ran work experience weeks for twelve BAME pupils from City and Islington College. The students contributed to the LBS database and learned “how slavery was intertwined with the development of Britain as a nation and how its legacies…can be recognised today,” of which they had been previously unaware \( **F**\). 

 LBS also contributed a section to the Runnymede Trust’s online “Our Migration Story” teaching and learning resource \(launched in 2016\), which showcases the often untold stories of the generations of migrants who came to and shaped the British Isles. OCR and AQA exam boards recommend “Our Migration Story” as a key resource for teaching GCSE history modules on migration, taken by a total of 11,615 students in 2019\-20. The LBS page introduces Britain’s links to slavery and the African diaspora, using \( **R1**\) to structure a student activity to facilitate discovering local connections to the slave trade and received 2,418 views in the impact period \( **G**\). Collaborating with the Historical Association, LBS established and helped staff a Teacher Fellowship \( **HATF**\) to train a cadre of schoolteachers able to inspire colleagues in their own disciplines. In April\-July 2019, 17 UK schoolteachers participated in this professional development scheme. Using LBS research \( **R1, R2**\), they explored how best to teach Britain's complex entanglement in slavery and abolition, and its legacies. Working with Draper and Donington, teachers developed new resources and lesson plans, as well as 14 working principles for future best practise when teaching this subject, which were adopted by the Historical Association in 2019 \( **G**\). The benefit of this “transformative experience” extended beyond the workplace, “this Fellowship was a profoundly important part of my development, not just as a history teacher, but as a citizen of the United Kingdom, coming to terms with this country’s past” \( **G**\). 

 **Cultural institutions and curation:** LBS has worked with major cultural entities to reframe and re\-present the UK’s national narratives surrounding slavery. Many cultural and heritage organisations rely on Oxford University Press’s *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography \( **ODNB**\)* as a key, authoritative reference tool for framing of the national story for public audiences. From 2016, *ODNB* collaborated with LBS to commission and publish 35 new entries for slave\-owners \(of which LBS members wrote 15\) and to amend hundreds more to reflect the LBS data, changing and enlarging the national narrative to recognise Britain’s extended histories of slavery \( **H**\). Informed by LBS research, Tate Britain, the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery have begun a systematic and comprehensive accounting of the legacies of slave\-ownership in their collections of British art. LBS searchable data \(from **R1**\) and collaboration were fundamental to each of these initiatives. Each of the galleries is identifying links between artists and works in their collections and slave\-ownership in order to re\-present the material in their public displays. At the Tate’s request, LBS developed a public statement on the connections of the Gallery to slavery, which was published on the Gallery’s website in 2019. The Head of Research at the Tate writes that LBS “has had a profound impact on Tate’s efforts to account for the legacies of slave\-ownership both in relation to the national collection and the institution’s history” \( **I**\). LBS has also had major impact on the work of both the National Trust for England & Wales and the National Trust for Scotland. The National Trust's September 2020 report on the links between colonialism, slavery and properties in its care cited LBS work \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\) in its main text and in 29 endnotes, thanking the LBS team for their assistance in its acknowledgements. The National Trust for Scotland's work on addressing the legacy of slavery and empire in its properties amply registers the importance of LBS. The Project Leader for Facing Our Past states that “the real game\-changer for all of us has been this amazing website called the Legacies of British Slave\-ownership” \( **J**\). Providing both high\-calibre, open access data and scholarly expertise on histories of slavery, LBS research has provided cultural organisations and wider publics powerful new resources for navigating contested heritage debates and policies.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

###  As leading interdisciplinary researchers on the changing landscape of secret intelligence in the age of ‘Big Data’, Professor Richard J. Aldrich and Dr Christopher R. Moran have become the ‘go to’ authorities for a variety of national and international stakeholders. Throughout the REF reporting period, in both governmental and non\-governmental contexts, there has been a strong appetite to understand the drivers behind this challenging new environment, as well as demand for tailored advice on how to adapt. Building a network of high\-level relationships, Aldrich and Moran have achieved policy impact by influencing the formulation of new working practices and legislation by UK Defence Intelligence and the German Parliament, resulting in greater openness and more robust formal oversight of intelligence by public bodies. They have achieved capacity\-building impact by shaping the training of national security practitioners in the US, Europe and Africa, leading to improved competencies around the importance of democratic control of secret agencies. They have also achieved cultural impact by changing the way that TV producers and museums represent intelligence to their audiences, resulting in more thought\-provoking and accurate portrayals that improve public understanding and therefore cultivate informal oversight by a better\-informed citizenry. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Working at the interdisciplinary intersection of Intelligence Studies, International Security and Diplomatic History, Aldrich and Moran have established a body of policy\-relevant, public\-facing and prize\-winning research that falls into the category of applied contemporary history, distilling ‘lessons learned’ from the secret past to illuminate and inform the handling of contemporary challenges. Supported by two large AHRC grants \(including one specifically for impact\), a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship \(Moran\) and a Leverhulme Major Fellowship \(Aldrich\), this research is distinctive in its efforts to capture the essence of how intelligence is changing in the twenty\-first century. Achieving recognition in the form of the 2017 ISA Intelligence Studies Section Distinguished Scholar Award \(Aldrich\) and the 2014 St Ermin’s Intelligence Book of the Year Award \(Moran\), its core claims can be grouped into three, with each grouping inspiring a distinct area of their impact activities. 

 **A and B – Claims underpinning policy impact and capacity\-building impact** 

 Intelligence agencies are losing market share in the knowledge business, overtaken by corporations including banks, ISP providers, social media, even supermarkets, who own most of the data on society \[ **3.1, 3.2**\]. They are also under greater scrutiny owing to whistleblowers, journalists and civil society activists who represent the new ‘shock troops’ of accountability, distinct from formal oversight provided by parliaments, committees and the judiciary \[ **3.3, 3.4, 3.5**\]. 

 The significance of the Edward Snowden leaks has been misunderstood. While the media jumped to frame the episode around an ‘End of Privacy’ and ‘Big Brother’ threats to civil liberties, our detailed research shows that the real crisis relates to official secrecy, which is being eroded by Information Age technologies as well as by cultural changes within the once highly\-compartmentalised security realm, including the extensive use of private contractors and IT specialists who are ethically uncomfortable with traditional ideas of state secrecy. In short, the key transformation has not been secret government looking at the public, but the public looking at secret government \[ **3.3, 3.4, 3.5**\]. 

 In this new intelligence ecosystem, where ‘spying’ is no longer the sole preserve of specialist government departments, but instead is owned more diffusely by the private sector, agencies should embrace formal oversight by official bodies and proactively manage their public profile – evidencing the extent to which they behave legally, proportionately to the level of threat and in accordance with democratic values. Aldrich and Moran argue that it is counterproductive for agencies to operate in complete secrecy. The absence of public trust damages efficiency, morale and recruitment. Suggesting that a balance can be struck between total disclosure and total secrecy, their research proposes that agencies can accelerate the declassification of older historical records; raise the visibility of spy chiefs; engage with universities; and produce more ‘on\-the\-record’ work, including authorised histories, memoirs and informative websites \[ **3.3, 3.4, 3.5**\]. 

 Security practitioners, from the leadership to the rank\-and\-file, are struggling to keep abreast of the oversight pressures and responsibilities placed upon them by a bewildering array of formal and informal forces \[ **3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5**\]. This is especially true beyond the Anglosphere, where there is a particular demand for training on this subject \[ **3.6**\]. 

 **C – Claims underpinning cultural impact** 

 Blending education with entertainment, TV documentaries and museums are uniquely positioned to publicise the uses and abuses of intelligence and the risks and rewards of secrecy. By bringing the past to life and shining a light on the present, they operate as facilitators of informal oversight, giving citizens a framework to critically assess the policies that are carried out in their name \[ **3.4**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **A – Policy impact: increasing the visibility and accountability of secret intelligence** 

 \[ **Text removed for publication**\]. 

 In 2015, Aldrich was commissioned as the only UK\-based academic to assist the German Parliament in their landmark inquiry into the Snowden Affair, an investigation that has revealed in unprecedented detail how mass surveillance is conducted and how well it has been hidden from official supervision. Along with producing a 20,000\-word study, Aldrich gave expert evidence to the Bundestag six times to elaborate on his findings. He was also called to give formal oral testimony. Despite attempts by the Federal Government to obstruct the Inquiry, the Parliament succeeded in publishing a report of 2,000 pages, containing 25 citations to Aldrich’s study and testimony \[ **5.2a**\]. One of the report’s chief recommendations – that precise legal regulation is needed with regards to international intelligence sharing, to safeguard against the unlawful transmission of citizen data to partners abroad – is taken almost verbatim from his written evidence \(p. 273\). Revealing grave democratic deficits regarding the governance of digital surveillance, the report has led to significant new regulations about the authorisation, use and oversight of Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst \(BND\), to minimise the potential for wrongdoing. Johannes Ahlefeldt, Political Adviser to the Social Democratic Party Parliamentary Group, has described Aldrich as ‘a key academic partner for the German Parliament as it looked to learn lessons from Snowden’. In particular, Ahlefeldt thanked Aldrich for ‘facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the British system of intelligence oversight’ \[ **5.2b**\]. Owing to these insights, on 19 May 2020 the German Constitutional Court ‘explicitly referred to the UK model when it called for better oversight and more effective control mechanisms’ \[ **5.2b**\]. 

 Aldrich and Moran’s research on accountability has benefitted the framing of other important security conversations. In 2016, Aldrich was approached by the Office of Security and Counter\-Terrorism \(OSCT\) to provide expert opinion on CONTEST, the UK’s counter\-terrorism strategy. Following three meetings, he was thanked by the Review Leader for alerting OSCT to the ‘importance of the future challenge of widening ownership’ of intelligence, which highlighted to officials that a joined\-up and transparent approach to counter\-terrorism was essential, with buy\-in not only from the agencies but the public \[ **5.3**\]. In 2019, Aldrich and Moran were asked by the Parliamentary Defence Committee Inquiry on UK Response to Hybrid Threats to submit written evidence. This evidence, which claimed that plausible deniability in ‘grey area’ warfare is difficult to achieve because of eroding official secrecy, was welcomed by the Committee for revealing the dangers, for UK policy\-makers, of using this new alluring tool of statecraft \[ **5.4**\]. Their publications on secrecy have also been cited in official US foreign policy documents and hearings: *Classified* \[ **3.3**\] in the U.S. State Department’s *Foreign Relations of the United States Series* \[ **5.5a**\]; and ‘Escaping from American Intelligence’ \[ **3.6**\] in the U.S. Congress’s ‘United States\-China Economic and Security Review’ \[ **5.5b**\]. 

 **B – Capacity\-building impact: fostering awareness and acceptance of oversight among national security practitioners** 

 Aldrich and Moran have delivered bespoke training to a range of practitioners who value independent evidence\-based perspectives on their work. This training has been important in strengthening the understanding and responsiveness of intelligence professionals to the demands of oversight, especially among professionals from states transitioning from authoritarian rule, looking to operate within democratic frameworks. In 2019, they presented at the International Intelligence Directors Course at MOD Chicksands to some 30 spy chiefs from around the world, including directors from the Global South eager to learn about Western models of accountability. Commissioned by John Kasuku, National Security Adviser to the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Aldrich and Moran’s 78\-page training manual on cybersecurity has embedded oversight principles within the Congolese intelligence community. To quote Kasuku, ‘The authoritative guide you put together has provided an important framework for us as we think about the challenges and opportunities presented by cyber in the national security realm’, noting that he was especially grateful for the ‘insights into the importance of building a cyber security strategy in Congo that operates within the rule of law and with appropriate accountability’ \[ **5.6**\]. Following Aldrich and Moran’s input, a new strategy was launched that included a commitment to the creation of an independent oversight body to monitor and regulate cyber programmes, a stunning demonstration of transparency by a security regime notorious for excessive secrecy and political repression. 

 One measure of the reach and significance of Aldrich and Moran’s capacity\-building impact is the sheer number of international stakeholders who have requested training, including repeat invitations. From September 2013 to December 2015, Aldrich provided 10 workshops for two Swiss inter\-governmental foundations, the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces \(DCAF\) and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy \(GCSP\). Funded by the United Nations, these sessions were organised specifically to support the development of parliamentary intelligence oversight in the Balkans, with the final session, in Ljubljana, held at the request of the Intelligence Oversight Committee of the Kosovo Parliament. Antje Fritz, DCAF Deputy Head of Operations, confirmed that Aldrich’s training has been instrumental in improving the strength and sustainability of ‘the governance of the security sector through inclusive and participatory reforms based on international norms and practices’ \[ **5.7**\]. In 2017, Moran was a keynote speaker at the ‘Intelligence in the Knowledge Society’ training event and conference in Bucharest, organised by Romania’s National Intelligence Academy in part to help practitioners from the former Eastern bloc, looking to shake off the legacy of authoritarianism, to develop stronger forms of oversight. 

 In the Anglosphere intelligence community, Aldrich and Moran have been repeatedly asked by agencies to deliver training on oversight. In 2019, they gave a two\-hour session to the CIA’s Office of Public Affairs, at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, characterised as being a ‘very valuable discussion’ \[ **5.8a**\]. Also in 2019, they visited National Defense University, the United States’s leading professional joint military/education institution, to deliver a workshop described by one officer as being ‘essential for our students who are all senior military officers or national security professionals \[and\] who will have to operate in the future environment you describe’ \[ **5.8b**\]. In 2018, Moran delivered a session at the U.S. State Department, attended by 51 officers from the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, the Department’s official liaison with the US intelligence community. Praised by the Department’s Chief Librarian for giving ‘a new perspective that will enrich their work’, the session was recorded for future training purposes and distributed on BNET, the internal broadcast channel for officers based in Embassies and missions worldwide \[ **5.8c**\]. Three times a year since 2013, Aldrich has led a session at the Cabinet Office for managers from MI5, MI6, GCHQ, UK Borders and the National Crime Agency. In 2020, he gave a session at the Downing Street Policy Unit, specifically for intelligence officers seconded to Number 10. In December 2020, Aldrich and Moran’s extensive programme of capacity\-building impact contributed to the University of Warwick being recognised as an ‘Academic Centre of Excellence’ in Cyber Security and Intelligence Education by the National Cyber Security Centre and its parent organisation, GCHQ. 

 **C – Cultural impact: building informal oversight through TV and museums** 

 Alongside their efforts to promote the formal oversight of intelligence and to convince agencies to be more open about what they do, Aldrich and Moran have enriched public understanding of intelligence from another direction, by impacting practitioners within the creative industries, principally TV producers and museum curators. The goal here has been to manifest informal oversight by a more learned citizenry, using direct impact upon TV and museum professionals to do so. Aldrich’s three\-part Channel 4 series – ‘Spying on the Royals’, ‘D\-Day: The King Who Fooled Hitler’ and ‘The Queen and the Coup’ – attracted four million viewers in the UK, placing it \(to quote producer Paul Elston\) amongst ‘the most highly viewed programmes on BBC2, Channel 4 and Channel 5’. The ten\-part Sky History series ‘Secret Wars Uncovered’, which Moran was consulted on and featured in, held the prime\-time Friday night slot for six weeks. 

 After working with the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC on their 2012 exhibition ‘Exquisitely Evil’, in an example of enduring connectivity between an academic and a non\-academic stakeholder, Moran was asked by the Vice President of Exhibitions and Programs in 2013 to help with a $162 million museum redesign. With over 350 hours of meetings with staff, including 16 separate trips to Washington, Moran played an important role in rethinking and reworking a new museum to promote deeper understanding of the world of intelligence. Foregrounding active, interpretive engagement rather than the traditional model of museum experience as passive observation, the new museum, which has moved to non\-profit status to maximise investment in its educational mission, uses immersive visitor experiences to ask questions about why and how nations spy, and what trade\-offs are acceptable in pursuit of security. ‘You have been such an asset to all we do’, acknowledged lead curator Alexis Albion, ‘playing a valuable role as an advisor as we developed our concept plan, taking part in brainstorming meetings, and by providing helpful research’. Moran was especially influential in ensuring that the museum confronted the subject of oversight – ‘a theme which runs through several exhibits’ \(Albion\) – and for generating exhibition material that encourages visitors to weigh up whether agencies have appropriately drawn the line between secrecy and openness. In Albion’s words, ‘Your books were particularly helpful, framing the ideas which came to shape our Top Secret exhibit, which explores important questions about the role of secrecy in a democracy’ \[ **5.9**\]. Following its opening in May 2019, the museum has been praised by high\-quality outlets such as *The New York Times* for being more international in coverage; more inclusive; and refusing to ‘Flinch from the Darker Side’ by addressing sensitive topics of public interest like intelligence failures, the ethics of surveillance and the politics of whistleblowing. As a more intellectually challenging site of heritage preservation, the museum has seen its visitor numbers increase by 16.7% \(pre\-Covid\). While closed for three months in 2020 because of the pandemic, the redesign allowed the museum to offer virtual programmes that found audiences in 60 countries. 

 Domestically, Moran was the lead curator for the exhibition ‘Spy Oxfordshire’, which opened at the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum, in Woodstock, on 28 October 2020. With its close links to Blenheim Palace and Winston Churchill, this local museum attracts a high footfall and plays an important part in community life by celebrating a collective heritage. Inspired by *Classified* \[ **3.3**\], which revealed the hidden history of Oxford dons who worked for wartime British intelligence and who after 1945 flouted the rules of secrecy by publishing best\-selling memoirs, the exhibition, the largest and most expensive in the museum’s history, uses the stories of these spies as a vector to encourage critical thinking about the role that intelligence plays in defence of democracy and the merits and demerits of secrecy. As well as writing many of the 24 displays, Moran was responsible for acquiring around half of the exhibition’s 110 objects \(valued at GBP250,000\) by reaching out to private collectors. Museum Director Ursula Corcoran has written of his involvement: ‘Your knowledge of the subject areas and guidance in interpreting the themes into illustrative panels, which are both informative and enjoyable for our visitors, has been of enormous value in progressing this exhibition’. She thanked him for ‘brokering new partnerships for the museum which has enabled us to loan objects’ and praised the ‘manner in which you reviewed and helped our volunteers with their own research and in providing a critical eye to their work’ \[ **5.10**\]. 

 In sum, while intelligence services are notoriously slow to change, and while there is still much to do in persuading them to adapt to the new environment in which they find themselves, Aldrich and Moran’s three\-pronged approach of targeting **policy impact, capacity\-building impact** and **cultural impact** has strengthened formal and informal oversight of secret intelligence, globally.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by Professor David **Higgins** resulted in greater understandings of extreme weather events, their historical underpinnings, and their complex relationship to global climate change. The research inspired a rich variety of creative responses among children and adults in regional, national, and international communities affected by climate change and associated extreme weather events.  Undertaken in collaboration with the Poetry Society \(PS\) and the Wordsworth Trust \(WT\), both of which benefited from increased levels of participation, the research achieved impact in four principal areas: 

 i\) Increased instances of schoolchildren in the UK, and young people in 19 countries worldwide, writing poetry to explore their feelings in response to imaginative literature about extreme weather events; 

 ii\) Changes to secondary school educational practices, especially those involving expanded approaches to teaching and writing poetry; 

 iii\) Adapted learning programmes at the WT, including creative exploration of climate change issues through the Arts Award scheme and diverse outreach activities; 

 iv\) Improved community wellbeing through creative participation and shared experiences of contemporary and historical extreme weather events.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Funded through an AHRC Leadership Fellowship \(GBP211,447\) awarded to **Higgins**, ‘British Romantic Writing and Environmental Catastrophe’ \(2016–17\) was the first major investigation of environmental catastrophe in Romantic\-period literature, adding significantly to a growing body of work that seeks to chart local cultural responses to extreme weather events in the context of global climate change. Timed to coincide with the bicentenary of the period from 1815–1818, during which the world experienced major climate change following the eruption of the Indonesian volcano Mount Tambora, research by **Higgins** and PDRA Dr Tess **Somervell** has expanded scholarly perceptions of Romantic representations of weather and climate and their legacy, advancing understanding of the cultural history of climate change. **Higgins**’ research demonstrates that one of the lessons of Mount Tambora and its aftermath is how vulnerable humans continue to be to environmental catastrophe: the devastating consequences of a single volcanic eruption clearly indicate that it does not take a big shift in global climate to have terrible effects **\[1\]**. 

 Romantic scholarship has tended to concentrate on the rejuvenating power of localised nature. By contrast, **Higgins’** research reveals a more complex picture of Romantic nature writing than is generally understood, showing how nature is often portrayed as threatening rather than restorative, and examining its concern with larger\-scale and potentially disruptive natural phenomena. **Higgins** argues that anxieties about the precariousness of the human species first emerged in the Romantic period, showing that the representation of extreme weather events, such as volcanic eruptions, in Romantic writing foreshadowed contemporary debates on global climate change by simultaneously emphasising human power to shape the environment and human vulnerability to environmental change **\[1, 2\]**. 

 Against some recent scholarship, **Higgins** contends that the Anthropocene \(‘Human Age’\) does not represent a sudden recent shift in human influence on the environment and knowledge of that influence. Rather, it should be understood in relation to a long and complex history of human\-nonhuman interactions **\[1\]**. He shows how key tropes in Romantic writing feature in later writing on climate change, influencing current debates about human agency in the Anthropocene. His case studies reveal how so\-called natural disasters do not represent an incursion into human life by an externalised ‘Nature’, but are complex processes in which nature and culture, experience and representation, are profoundly enmeshed **\[1, 2\]**. 

 For **Higgins**, the notion of environmental disaster is problematic in so far as ‘natural’ disasters like earthquakes take place within wider socio\-political contexts, and the damage they cause may vary widely according to people’s individual standards of living as well as the nature and level of institutional response. Earthquakes are not just visitations from Nature: there is always interaction with our own human structures and arrangements. Recent research has shown that the natural and the cultural, the human and the nonhuman, are profoundly entangled, but **Higgins** reveals that the Romantics were already interested in that entanglement. He also draws attention to how the Romantic period saw the beginnings of a key irony of modernity: how the study of nature was separated from culture at the very time humans were having unprecedented impact on the earth system through the exploitation of fossil fuels. 

 **Somervell**’s research on Romantic representations of flooding similarly shows that literature of the period attributed agency and vitality to nonhuman environmental forces **\[3, 4\].** She argues that Romantic representations of the biblical Deluge anticipate contemporary discussions of the Anthropocene in the ways they attach moral meaning to geological history. Her study of Wordsworth’s writing about the Deluge further reveals Romantic poetry’s capacity to imagine positive \(rather than apocalyptic\) outcomes from environmental catastrophes, including the fostering of connections between human communities and even sympathetic relations between humans and destructive nonhuman forces. **Somervell**’s analysis of Romantic narratives **\[4\]**, in addition to her broader climate\-related work in collaboration with Nigel Clark and **Higgins** **\[5\]**, highlights the importance of storytelling as a way of coping with environmental change and finding hope in human\-nonhuman entanglements, providing opportunities for readers to develop their own narratives in turn.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Higgins**’ and **Somervell**’s combined research led to the development of two major creative initiatives: \(i\) an international poetry competition in partnership with the PS’s Young Poets Network \(YPN\); and \(ii\) ‘Weather Words’, a sustained collaboration with the WT’s education and community engagement teams resulting in multiple creative events and workshops for children and adults. Impacts arising from both projects were as follows: 

 **i\) Young people’s creative responses to climate change** 

 **Higgins**’ and **Somervell**’s research directly inspired the international poetry competition ‘I am the Universe: Writing Climate Change’ \(1 March \- 23 April 2017\). Adjudicated by the award\-winning English poet Helen Mort, the competition invited young people up to the age of 25 to build on the legacy of Romantic authors to ‘write their way through’ contemporary climate change **\[C\]**. Specific insights from **Higgins**’ and **Somervell**’s research on how Romantic writers attributed agency to the nonhuman world through particular poetic images inspired Mort **’**s creative prompts for competitors to combine Romantic and contemporary representations of environmental catastrophe, the natural world, and human impact upon it. **Higgins** and **Somervell** provided interpretative guidance for each prompt and contributed to Mort’s introductory brochure for the competition. Mort summarised the importance of the competition’s themes to the young poets involved by observing that they each ‘took a slant look at shifting landscapes \[in order to make\] the issues relevant to their own lives’ **\[C\]**. 

 The competition generated 239 entries from 211 young people in 19 countries across five continents **\[D\]**. It attracted an unusually high number of young men, who made up a third of all entrants, ‘a big achievement and a stronger showing than the YPN challenge average’ **\[E\]**. A poetry pamphlet featured the winners’ work alongside a newly commissioned poem by Mort, with 3,000 copies distributed to teachers at education fairs and at PS events for young people. The pamphlet was also published online \(26 September 2017\) and has since been read over 1,200 times, generating over 11,900 impressions **\[E\]**. **Higgins**’ and **Somervell**’s partnership with the PS was cited in Arts Council England’s Environmental Report for 2017–18 as an example of good practice in stimulating creative responses from young people to climate change, a subject of increasing concern to them **\[F\]**. The partnership’s success also led the PS Director, in September 2019, to consult **Higgins** and **Somervell** about Romantic texts to be featured in a Department for Education national recitation competition in schools  [http://www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/](http://www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/http:/www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/).  Reflecting positively on the original collaboration, the PS Director stated, ‘I think the climate change angle is a wonderful way to get young people interested in looking at Romantic poets’ **\[I\]**. 

 ‘Weather Words’, a separate 2017 collaboration with the WT, drew on project research to inspire a wide range of creative responses from children and adults to the historical underpinnings of climate change. **Higgins** and **Somervell** compiled and interpreted a range of sources, including Romantic poems, images and items from the WT’s collections and provided critical commentaries, gleaned from their own research, that highlighted the agency of the nonhuman environment and the capacity of extreme weather events and other environmental catastrophes to produce attitudinal change. These sources in turn provided the stimuli for a WT outreach programme – immersive weather walks, poetry and creative writing workshops – involving 198 pupils from three primary schools \(two in Yorkshire, one in Cumbria\) and one secondary school in Cumbria. The programme’s focus on Romantic poetry inspired pupils to write their own nature poems, fostering a greater historical awareness of global warming and the extreme weather events that are directly or indirectly associated with it. These events are commonly misconstrued as manifestations of the present, but in fact have roots stretching back into the past. One student used Byron’s poem ‘Darkness’ to inspire her own poem, while another shared his realisation that ‘climate change is real and isn’t just happening now, it’s been happening for a long time’ **\[B\]**. The WT’s Education Development Manager described the programme’s impact as ‘far reaching’, having ‘opened many children and young people’s eyes to the possibilities of poetry and Romanticism, and \[having\] also given them a vehicle to understand the less recent history of climate change’ **\[B\]**. Engagement with ‘Weather Words’ also gave pupils new opportunities for personal development through the WT’s delivery of the Arts Award scheme, resulting in 39 of the cohort achieving an Arts Award Explore and 139 achieving an Arts Award Discover **\[A\]**. The Education Development Manager noted that the children involved had experienced a markedly positive ‘effect on their own wellbeing, of suddenly being switched on to poetry, or of feeling that writing it was within their grasp, but also of the impact on their confidence, pride in themselves and maybe even their future contributions’ **\[B\]**. 

 **ii\) Adapting secondary school teaching practices and WT educational programmes** 

 ‘Weather Words’’ emphasis on children writing poetry themselves triggered changes to English teaching practices at one of the participant schools, Queen Katherine Secondary School in Kendal. Its Head of English remarked that these changes had allowed teachers to be ‘more creative’ in their approach to poetry and had impressed upon them ‘the importance of writing poetry as well as studying it’. The project also led them to reflect that ‘poetry had largely fallen out of \[the\] KS3 curriculum’ and that their teaching had ‘fallen into the trap of preparing students for the GCSE skills during KS3 at the cost of a well\-rounded and broad curriculum’. Teaching staff were duly prompted to ‘address this area of weakness’, implementing permanent changes to the curriculum so that it ‘now encompasses a holistic approach to English teaching: developing our \[own\] voices as writers with the text at the heart of every lesson.’ The weather\-themed poetry activities were ‘recycled’ for three separate study events at the school, and a direct and enduring legacy of the project is that poetry, both written and read, now features in the curriculum for every year group from Y7\-13 **\[J\]**. 

 Project research also improved the content, quality and reach of the WT’s programme for schools, as its Education Development Manager confirmed in 2020: ‘We are carrying out a weather/climate change Arts Award programme with three \[new\] schools in Cumbria which has evolved from \[this\] project’. The same programme was also offered to six schools during the 2017–19 period, with a total of 141 Discover and 176 Explore Arts Awards being achieved **\[A\]**. The project helped to raise the profile of the WT’s work with schools, with media attention from the likes of the *Westmorland Gazette* \(22 July 2017\) leading to an increase in the numbers of both onsite and outreach engagements. From March 2017–March 2018, of the WT’s 6,602 onsite and offsite education engagements across Key Stages 2\-3, 10% were directly due to ‘Weather Words’ **\[A\]**. 

 **iii\) Strengthening communities and improving wellbeing through creative participation** 

 Creative workshops and other activities delivered as part of ‘Weather Words’ resulted in an improved sense of wellbeing and belonging amongst numerous adult community groups in Cumbria. There were 143 individual engagements with community participants across the range of outreach events **\[H\]**. These events, directly stimulated by **Higgins**’ and **Somervell’**s research findings, supported participants to produce poetry, photography, creative writing and art in response to extreme weather and other environmental catastrophes. For example, **Somervell**’s research into Wordsworth’s writings about floods informed the selection of writing prompts, and their inspiration was visible in the outputs produced by community participants, who tried to make sense of their own experiences of recent extreme flooding in Cumbria through their own creative work. 

 Some participants had their work exhibited throughout 2017 at Dove Cottage, the Old Courthouse in Shap, and the Solway Arts Annual Summer Show, with a combined visitor attendance of 499 **\[G\]**, while the WT education team reported that the events continued to inspire people to share their ‘wild weather’ stories, generating new artistic responses long after the lifetime of the project **\[G\]**. Community participants also read their writings aloud at a public ‘Words on the Weather’ day at Dove Cottage \(15 July 2017\), alongside contributions from **Higgins** and **Somervell**, who spoke about their individual research and collaborative project work. Audience feedback included: ‘The poetry was stand out for me and so incredibly moving. What talent hidden in the fells\!’; ‘Thought that poetry was so special yesterday. Listening to those accounts of their flooding experiences’; and ‘It is comforting to see how humanity rises to meet these challenges’ **\[G\]**. The WT Curator and Head of Learning highlighted these events as ‘testimony to why such projects matter’, underlining their benefits to social cohesion and the local community: ‘Many tens of people’s lives have been affected … and each of these engagements seems to have been meaningful. People have made new friends and new connections and shared this through the readings and the exhibitions’ **\[A\]**. 

 Participation in these shows inspired some community members to form a new monthly art and writers’ group in Shap, developing sustainable engagement with the WT and linking their own creative work to its collections and exhibitions **\[A\]**. One participant commented that these monthly sessions had reinvigorated her own creative practice, getting her ‘back in the painting zone’, and inspiring her to begin delivering regular ‘steadily attended Art 4 All’ sessions for local villages as ‘direct spin\-offs’ from the project’s sessions. Another recorded the ‘exhilarating’ effects of these activities, while still another noted: ‘This project has given an outlet for ordinary people \[…\] to express a depth of feeling that would have otherwise remained dormant’ **\[G\]**. Others observed that ‘I am only one of many touched by this project which has provided so many stimulating situations that have enriched our lives’, and that ‘the project inspired so many adults and children to express themselves in ways that they might not have discovered otherwise’. Independent WT evaluation also noted how the project improved wellbeing amongst older people: for example, two women in their 80s with no experience of painting since their schooldays, produced ‘remarkable work – strong and distinctive’. These women had spent their lifetimes focusing on raising families and felt that ‘now was their time’ **\[G\]**. The numerous positive outcomes of ‘Weather Words’ serve to confirm one of **Somervell**’s key critical insights, that creative responses to imaginative literature about environmental change, such as those produced by schools and other communities in Yorkshire/Cumbria in relation to local flooding, can support individual understandings of the history of extreme weather events and lead to better connections between the communities themselves **\[4\]**. 

 ‘British Romantic Writing and Environmental Catastrophe’ was selected as one of nine case studies featured in *A Unique Contribution*, a 2017 AHRC report highlighting research projects that provide new perspectives on environmental issues and explore how people can be engaged in caring for and protecting their environments \( [https://ahrc.ukri.org/documents/project\-reports\-and\-reviews/ahrc\-environment\-report/](https://ahrc.ukri.org/documents/project-reports-and-reviews/ahrc-environment-report/)\). The public reach of the research was further extended by **Higgins** and **Somervell**’s national media contributions, including **Higgins’** two articles for *The Conversation* \(12.9.16\) and *The Independent* \(14.9.16\); an interview he gave on the BBC Radio 4 Today Programme \(2.9.16\), which was subsequently excerpted for BBC News Online; and a co\-authored article for *The Conversation* \(10.2.20\), which has received over 20,500 views to date.
