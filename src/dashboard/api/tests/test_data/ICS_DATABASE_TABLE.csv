 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 DIGIWHIST \(The Digital Whistleblower\) is used by policy\-makers, investigators and civil society organisations in the UK and Europe to tackle corruption in government contracting by providing access to novel datasets, measurement tools and policy\-relevant evidence. The project has: 

 1\) had transnational policy impact across major European and global institutions; 

 2\) improved anti\-corruption practices, including risk assessment and auditing; and 

 3\) enabled civil society organisations to monitor public procurement activity and to organise anticorruption action. 

 DIGIWHIST has significantly shifted international policy debates on anticorruption and public contracting towards a data\-driven approach. DIGIWHIST data and indicators now form an integral part of risk\-assessment methods employed by investigators and auditors and have been adopted by major organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development \(OECD\) to assess country administrative quality. Civil society watchdog web portals running on DIGIWHIST data and indicators have been established across Europe. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Corruption has featured among the top five concerns of citizens across Europe throughout the 2010s. It carries a variety of significant social, political and economic costs including loss of trust in public institutions. Public procurement amounts to about 15% of GDP annually in the EU. According to the OECD, public procurement is the highest corruption risk in developed economies, even higher than areas traditionally associated with bribery, such as paying taxes or accessing healthcare. Estimates vary, but a recent report put the annual cost of corruption risk in public procurement at around five billion euros \[E6\]. 

 DIGIWHIST promotes government accountability in procurement activities. Our rich, reliable and actionable databases and risk indicators provide usable, low\-cost transparency for policy makers, bidding companies and civil society, enabling them to mobilise against corruption and build integrity. 

 The DIGIWHIST research project \(2014\-18\), led by researchers at Cambridge’s Department of Sociology \(MihályFazekas and Lawrence King\) used Big Data methods to mine large amounts of online administrative documents to identify corruption risk patterns in government purchasing processes across 35 European countries and to enhance anticorruption measures using new, objective and reliable data. 

 Almost all governments publish procurement data \(tenders, contracts etc.\) online in a format that only allows reading of a single document at a time. This hinders systematic analysis of large numbers of documents. In 2018, DIGIWHIST developed an automated method for collecting public procurement tender and contract data and organised the information into a flexible database structure freely analysable and downloadable at  [www.opentender.eu](http://www.opentender.eu/). The DIGIWHIST datasets contain over 19 million contracts worth 5\-10% of annual GDP in 32 European countries \(including all EU institutions and member states\). 

 Using these large\-scale datasets, DIGIWHIST has created new quantitative tools for risk measurement based on an established understanding of high\-risk scenarios, such as convoluted tender specifications that seem to be tailored to particular firms and may thus limit the number of bids in an otherwise competitive market \[R4\]. By estimating the prevalence of such high\-risk situations, DIGIWHIST produced corruption risk indicators that can be used to identify risks, both in individual contracts, and \(when aggregated\) in countries, regions, markets, or government agencies \[R2, R3\]. The DIGIWHIST risk indicators have been widely adopted by practitioners and academics as tools for the measurement and management of corruption risk. 

 The datasets and risk indicators created by DIGIWHIST were used by the research team to generate policy\-relevant research findings evaluating the effectiveness of anticorruption policies and targeted monitoring interventions. This research activity includes work on the role of checks and balances in preventing state capture in Hungary \[R5\], and the effectiveness of bureaucratic controls in safeguarding EU Structural Funds from fraud and corruption \[R1\]. 

  

 For the work on EU structural funds \[R1\], DIGIWHIST data from over 100,000 public procurement contracts was analysed to further elaborate DIGIWHIST’s framework of corruption risk indicators \(see above\) and link them to agency\-level data in the public sector. Propensity scores matching estimations suggested that EU funds increase corruption risk by up to 34 percent, largely due to overly formalistic compliance and EU Funds overriding domestic accountability mechanisms in public organizations entirely dependent on external funds. 

 The work on state capture in Hungary \[R5\] also used DIGIWHIST data to create a novel analytic framework; this time linking DIGIWHIST risk indicators to social network analysis to measure capture as clustered networks of organisations bearing high levels of corruption risk. The power of the new analytical framework was demonstrated by exploring how the radical centralization of the governing elite following the 2010 elections in Hungary affected centralization of state capture.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Over 1,000 weekly users \[E1\] visit the DIGIWHIST data portal which gives free public access to over 19 million contracts across European countries and EU institutions. Users include government agencies, watchdog groups, journalists, researchers and NGOs. For the first time, European public procurement data are directly accessible in a structured format, increasing the transparency and accountability of public officials and public organisations across Europe. DIGIWHIST enables organisations to hold public officials to account, and it allows public organisations to fulfil their regulatory functions by enabling measurement and management of corruption risk. DIGIWHIST watchdog portals reach several thousand users each week. The overall reach of the portal is likely to be around 100,000 users per annum \(unique users based on IP address as reported by Google analytics\). 

 DIGIWHIST has had international impact on public procurement and anticorruption policy, oversight institutions carrying out investigations and audits, and civil society organisations active in the anticorruption movement. 

 **1\) Transnational policy impact: European and global institutions** 

 DIGIWHIST has had impact on transnational institutions at both European and global levels. Hitherto, corruption measurement has relied on investigated or audited cases, a method that underestimates corruption. DIGIWHIST has transformed practice, using a big data approach and quantitative risk indicator tools to enable real\-time monitoring and targeted audits. 

-  The European Court of Auditors has recommended that the European Commission adopt the DIGIWHIST approach in order to enhance the measurement and management of corruption and fraud risks across the EU \[E2, p.21, p.77\]. 

-  The OECD’s work on data\-driven risk assessment methodologies \[E3, p.44\] has used DIGIWHIST tools and research findings to measure the scale of corruption and corporate policy capture \[E4\] and is promoting this approach across the world \[E5, p.10\-11\]. This represents a significant shift for the OECD \- from policy analysis relying on opinion surveys and expert interviews towards a Big Data approach. OECD \[E3\] has highlighted the application of DIGIWHIST risk\-assessment tools by the Mexico City International Airport, citing it as an exemplar of how the approach can be used in large\-scale public projects. 

-  The European Parliament’s flagship study on the cost of corruption across the EU devoted an entire chapter to DIGIWHIST, using our data and methodology to produce a novel estimate for the cost of corruption \[E6, section 2.3\]. This supported the European Parliament’s push for stronger corruption controls in the EU. The European Commission’s Directorate\-General for Regional and Urban Policy \(DG REGIO\) flagship report on EU territorial cohesion has used DIGIWHIST research to gain an insight into the quality of regional governance \[E7, p158\]. These two cases exemplify the impact in supporting the marked shift in EU policies on public procurement and anticorruption towards one based on risk indicators derived from Big Data methods. 

 **2\) Improving anti\-corruption practices** 

 DIGIWHIST’s work with national and international anticorruption and public procurement agencies has led to tangible improvements in measuring the progress of anti\-corruption policies. 

-  The OECD/Sigma program and the European Commission use DIGIWHIST indicators and benchmarks for measuring accession and neighbourhood countries’ progress towards EU norms and the fulfilment of accession criteria \[E8, p225\]. 

-  The World Bank promotes the DIGIWHIST approach in its lending and grants projects across the world, 

 “Even beyond Europe, the project's public procurement data analytics have had a significant impact as they have inspired and contributed to new ways of approaching the assessment of corruption risk and public integrity in a variety of governance contexts. For the World Bank, the analytical methods and corruption risk indicators developed by DIGIWHIST have informed out thinking about our own risk indicators and helped us identify what is feasible with Big Data analytics in this domain. Furthermore, we have used DIGIWHIST's analytical approaches in providing technical assistance to national governments, for example in Mexico” \[E9, Senior Governance Specialist, Governance Global Practice, The World Bank\]. 

 **3\) Impact on major organisations’ risk assessment and auditing** 

 The European Investment Bank \(EIB\) finances projects worth over GBP45 billion annually. DIGIWHIST has worked with EIB on multiple events and projects, and its Fraud Investigations Division states that DIGIWHIST has had a broad impact on their approach to risk measurement and management. Since 2018, the organisation has shifted from reliance on whistle\-blower reports, towards a more data\-driven approach to risk assessment based on adoption of DIGIWHIST’s corruption risk indicators \[E3, p.44\]. 

 “Thanks to DIGlWHIST’s work, public procurement data across Europe have been systematically collected, structured, analysed, and disseminated, increasing transparency and accountability of public officials across the continent. The project’s public procurement data analytics have had a broad impact on the thinking of the Inspectorate General on measuring and managing risks of EIB operations. Through a number of co\-organised events and projects, the European Investment Bank was supported by DIGIWHIST data and indicators. Among others, we have incorporated DIGlWHIST’s corruption risk indicators for quantitative risk\-scoring in order to select high\-risk counterpart organizations \(borrowers\) for our Proactive Integrity Reviews with the aim of mitigating risks and avoiding large financial losses,” \[E10, Head of Fraud Investigations Division, and Head of PIR Unit, Inspectorate General, European Investment Bank\]. 

-  DIGIWHIST data has supported audits and criminal investigations by various investigative bodies, including the EU’s European Anti\-fraud Office and the Romanian anticorruption agency. While the exact impact is not public due to privacy considerations, DIGIWHIST data made audits and investigations more efficient by reducing data collection costs. 

 **4\) Impact on civil society** 

 There are a great number of NGOs across Europe which monitor public procurement corruption and organise anticorruption action using DIGIWHIST. Most prominently, a growing number of online watchdog portals have been created across Europe, especially in Eastern Europe, focusing on government contracting. Many of these portals, such as those in the Netherlands and Poland \[E11\], use DIGIWHIST data and indicators. This increase in civil society monitoring of corruption has been enabled by Digiwhist’s work providing online access to procurement data in a format that allows for systematic large\-scale data analysis, as the statement from the Founder of Barometr Ryzyka Nadużyć  makes clear, “Thanks to the DIGIWHIST team and Dr Mihaly Fazekas we have created the Corruption Risk Barometer \[E11\], an interactive tool for the citizens, journalists and researchers measuring the risk of corruption on the Polish public procurement market,” \[E12 Founder of Barometr Ryzyka Nadużyć, Head of the Public Integrity Program at the Stefan Batory Foundation\]. This democratisation of procurement monitoring demonstrates the scale and reach of Digiwhist’s impact.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The work presented addressed the need to monitor and support dementia patients at home using smart meters, which resulted in the first technology in the area. We conducted the world's first clinical trial of such technology in partnership with MerseyCare NHS Foundation Trust, which was endorsed by BEIS and SmartEnergyGB. Findings show that the technology was supportive, cost\-effective and allowed families and clinicians to assess patient wellbeing in real time. Moreover, the work generated 5 policy documents, supported 4 spin\-out companies, and influenced the replacement of SMETS1 with SMET 2 meters to support the delivery of healthcare services. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 This approach is a world\-first support platform that captures the detailed habits of an individual’s interactions with electrical devices and identifies anomalies or changes in routine to facilitate early intervention practice \(EIP\) by monitoring deviations in behaviour that correlates with disease progression. The system identifies individual appliance usage to model normal and abnormal behaviour. The system can identify kettle, toaster, microwave, cooker, and washing machine usage. Interactions with these devices are used to detect significant variations in activities of daily living \(ADL\), and safeguard patients. This system provides access to fine\-grained information about how and when a person conducts ADL. Practitioners have never had access to this type of real\-time information, meaning care packages and interventions are at best retrofitted using patient and carer feedback. This often results in insufficient care packages and delays that don't fully support the unique needs of each patient. Our system provides a clearer assessment of a patient's well\-being and their ability to cope using real\-time data from the appliances patients use to perform ADL \[A\]. This means the data is objective, reliable and not dependent on interpretation from patients or carers who have different cognitive viewpoints and biases. The results demonstrate that the system can monitor and support patients in an unobtrusive and personalised manner. 

 The system was trialled with Mersey NHS Foundation Trust in 2016 \- 2017. The trial proved we could: 

-  Analyse electrical usage and identify appliances through load disaggregation and machine learning to model behavioural routines \[1\]. To date this is the only algorithm that can successfully identify appliance usage using 10\-second smart meter data and the standard government approved hardware installation. 

-  Achieve encouraging detection accuracy across all appliance classes. In many cases, the algorithm can detect appliances from aggregate load with very high sensitivity and specificity values \[1\]. 

-  Use collected data to create a personalised behavioural baseline to continually analyse and detect dementia progression or sudden relapses \[1\]. The results from the clinical trial show that the system can accurately establish patient routines, while detecting anomalies in behaviour \[1\], \[A\]. This is an important advancement in dementia care as clinicians only see patients annually with the result for a 12\-month period and thus are unaware of how the patients are coping or the disease is progressing. Our system provides 24/7 assessment and reporting using a traffic light approach to record normal, worrying and abnormal behaviour \[A\]. This is a world first solution \[B\]. 

-  Deliver clinical benefits that allow clinicians to: 

-  Understand the ADL for specific patients and identify routines of normal and abnormal behaviour using the five devices. Clinicians in old age psychiatry have never before been able to access this level of information about the patients they care for, providing a truly ground\-breaking approach to ambient assistive living \[2\], \[3\], \[4\], \[A\], \[B\]. 

-  Provide personalised care packages tailored to the unique needs of each patient \[5\], \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We conducted the world's first clinical trial of the technology outlined in Section 2 in partnership with Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust \[A\], \[G\]. Following the trial, the Trust recognised the value and impact of this technology and its ability to provide a supportive and cost\-effective solution to assist people living with dementia to remain independent and at home \[A\]. More importantly, the Trust confirmed that this technology allows families and clinicians to build an accurate picture of how a patient is living alone in their own home \[A\]. Independently, the work was endorsed in the SmartEnergyGB commissioned 2020 health report \[F\]. The report states that reliable recognition of electrical devices and appliances in the home remains an active area of research. They confirmed that the work conducted by LJMU is at the forefront of Non\-Intrusive Load Monitoring \(NILM\) and that we have overcome many of the challenges faced by researchers worldwide by focusing on high energy appliances that give indications of ADL and important behavioural routines. The work on the clinical use of smart meters in healthcare is supported by the government as evidenced in \[J.1\], \[D\], \[E\], \[F\]. 

  

 As a result of SmargEnergyGB and National Health Executive \(NHE\) coverage \[G\], \[J.3\], the research generated 5 individual policy documents \[D\]\-\[H\]. Each of these policy documents utilised our work to lobby the stakeholders of the UK smart metering infrastructure and the healthcare services it can provide \[C\]. In conclusion \[E\] is formally a commitment to fund further innovation in this area based on the findings in our work. More specifically, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) states “Government is committed to financing further innovation in this area to incentivise and enable continuing progress for the benefit of consumers. BEIS will continue to monitor and where appropriate, support these developments through ongoing research and innovation\-friendly policies to ensure that smart meters continue to deliver their intended benefits for consumers” \[E\]. The document concludes that based on our work, smart meters also have the potential to support the development of new products and services outside of the energy sector such as digital healthcare products that enable those with long term conditions to stay at home longer \[E\], \[D\], \[H\]. \[F\] formally endorsed the importance of our work and directly informed the ongoing SmartEngeryGB strategy for smart meter services. These policies also identified many other areas whereby services could be developed to support healthcare provision as evidenced in \[F\]. 

 The work supported four spinout companies \[I 1\- 4\] that benefited from both the research and collaboration between LJMU and Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust. In \[I.1\] the research was used to help develop Chameleon’s I•VIE platform which models behavioural routines using our approach. The I•VIE service is used nationally within the UK. We had numerous consultations sessions with \[I.2\] which led to the development and use of new products in Japan. We also informed \[I.3\] and \[I.4\] of the technology through several consultations, which is used in the UK and Germany. 

 The results of our work influenced the replacement of SMETS1 with SMET 2 meters along with changes to the Smart Data Communications Company \(DCC\) protocols to support the delivery of health care services \[F\]. There was a strategic change within SmartEnergyGB that are now developing post infrastructure strategies to support smart meter services. Our 6\-year working relationship with SmartEnergyGB influenced the requirement for healthcare services which led to the subsequent policy change as evidenced in this section and widespread media interest in the national press \[J.2\]. 

 We have an ongoing relationship with national government policy makers \[J.3\] and as evidenced in this section we have a pivotal role in the smart meter infrastructure and the future services it will provide. As stated from the head of policy from SmartEnergyGB “Over the years Paul and Carl have kindly presented their work at various events and workshops we have run. By sharing their research, opinions and insights with our stakeholders they have helped our campaign to reach new audiences and have made an important contribution to our work promoting the technology” \[C\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Tumour organoids offer a powerful pre\-clinical discovery tool for new anti\-cancer drugs. Barriers to commercialisation include culturing organoids with sufficient uniformity and scale to meet rigorous drug development pipeline requirements. Cardiff research developed a novel method for the culture of large quantities of uniform organoids, validated for physiological characteristics. Subsequent collaboration with the University of Bath resulted in a patented bioprocessing technology to grow uniform, reproducible organoids at scale. This research led to a new biotechnology growth\-phase company Cellesce Ltd \(established 2015\), currently valued at £15M. To date, Cellesce Ltd has raised £6M in equity and grants, additionally securing key contracts with multiple customers, including global pharmaceutical and research development companies \(e.g., GSK, Merck Millipore and Horizon\).

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Tumour organoids are 3D, self\-assembling, multi\-tissue cultures that can be grown from patient biopsies. As a miniature version of a patient’s tumour, they provide a better predictor of new cancer drug efficacy than traditional 2D cell culture systems. Organoids also offer benefits over 3D spheroid cultures by exhibiting self\-assembly and multiple cell types, replicating aspects of the original tumour and its interactions with drugs. Organoids had not previously been grown stably, reproducibly, and on a large enough scale for wider commercial use, despite considerable industry interest in their use for *in vitro* drug discovery pipelines. 

 The Cardiff team, led by Dale, conducted a programme of research to address this issue, starting with understanding key signalling pathways in mouse organoid models, and continuing through to application in human tumour models and expansion of organoid generation at scale. 

#   1.  Developing and validating organoid models of cancer 

 a. Organoid models of colorectal cancer 

 The Cardiff team originally began working with organoids to study the WNT signalling pathway **\[3.1\]**. More than 90% of human colon cancers have mutations leading to the constitutive activation of the WNT/beta\-catenin signalling pathway, which normally functions to maintain the unique crypt and villus structure of the intestinal epithelium. WNT signalling is also crucial to the formation of intestinal organoids in culture and is the focus of the Cardiff team’s expertise. 

 In 2012, the Cardiff team established the culture of 3D crypt organoids derived from the small intestine of the Tet\-O ΔN89β\-catenin mouse. They demonstrated the organoids’ utility as an *in vitro* model for the therapeutic targeting of WNT signalling in tumours; specifically, they showed similar early\-stage modulation of gene expression by small molecule WNT inhibitors in organoids compared to equivalent *in vivo* models **\[3.1\]**. 

 b. Broadening applicability of cancer organoids: from colorectal to mammary models 

 Funded by Breast Cancer Now **\[G3.1\]**, the Cardiff researchers further developed the culture conditions for a mouse mammary tissue organoid model. This culture system was extended to two different mouse mammary tumour organoid systems \(MMTV\-WNT\-1 and p53\-/\+\) designed to assay anti\-breast cancer compounds and WNT inhibitors \(2013–2016\) **\[3.2\]**. This work demonstrated that the Cardiff team’s organoid technology could be expanded beyond colorectal cancers, providing important translatability for research on other cancers. 

 c. Translation to human cancers and drug discovery 

 The applicability of the Cardiff mouse organoid system as a platform for pre\-clinical cancer drug testing was further verified by the Cardiff team in a collaborative project with the Merck Group \(previously Merck Serono\) **\[G3.2\]**. The Cardiff team showed that the gene expression signature from Tet\-O ΔN89β\-catenin crypt organoids, treated with a Merck\-owned small\-molecule WNT inhibitor, mirrored that of data from the mouse model from which they had been derived **\[3.3\]**. 

 In further research funded by the existing Merck collaboration, and Cancer Research Wales **\[G3.3\]** and Cancer Research UK **\[G3.4\]**, the Cardiff team cultured patient\-derived 3D colorectal cancer organoids. They carried out a range of *in vitro* assays using these organoids, which established the benefit of compounds known as tankyrase inhibitors to modify aberrant WNT signalling found in colorectal cancer. These assays established that the inhibitors modulated the expression of genes in the WNT pathway, which the group predicted would reduce the tumorigenic properties of the organoids. When small tankyrase inhibitor\-treated cancer organoids were xenografted into immune\-deficient mice, the organoids had a reduced capacity to develop into tumours, validating the *in vitro* findings in an *in vivo* model system, and demonstrating expansion of the method to human cancer organoids **\[3.4\]**. 

#  2.2 Scale expansion of uniform organoids 

 The key issue in applying organoids to high throughput drug screening is the problem of uniformity in size, reproducibility and scale **\[3.5\]**. While organoids can be directly derived from healthy or diseased patient tissue, they are often heterogenous in nature, and limited in number. To address this bottleneck, the Cardiff team developed a culture method for use in conjunction with bioreactor culturing techniques. The method was designed to facilitate production of large quantities of uniform organoids, which crucially are never grown in contact with plastic \(known to alter cell behaviour and reduce *in vitro* assay validity\). The team combined their organoid culturing method, with the bioreactor expertise of collaborators from the University of Bath \(a team led by Ellis and Argyle\). This collaboration led to the development of a bioprocess to culture large quantities of uniform organoids, which the researchers subsequently patented \(PCT/GB2017/052026\) **\[3.6\]**. The patented method involved: 

1.  disaggregating primary organoids to create a single\-cell suspension; 

1.  seeding this cell suspension in a matrix\-based culture medium, and culturing in a bioreactor for 24\-72 hours, resulting in up to 1 million organoids of varying sizes; 

1.  recovering these organoids from the matrix medium to create an organoid suspension; 

1.  sequentially passing the organoid suspension through two sets of cell strainers to exclude organoids above and below specific diameters. 

 This patented process generates a large quantity of uniform organoids which can be cultured further in the bioreactor, or frozen for storage or shipping. The research subsequently underpinned establishment of a spin\-out company \(Section 4\), which was further supported by proprietary tumour cell lines developed by the Cardiff team **\[3.4\]**, and a purpose\-built bioreactor to support organoid culture, developed by the Bath team.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Based on their novel organoid research, and patented bioprocess, the Cardiff team, together with their Bath collaborators, established spin\-out company Cellesce Ltd in 2015. This has now matured from start\-up to growth phase, with an estimated value of £15M, and new global biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers and partners. 

#  4.1 Development of a growth\-phase spin out biotech company 

 Cellesce Ltd was originally established as BBF BIO LIMITED in 2013. It lay dormant until 2015, when the company name was changed to Cellesce Ltd, and it became the vehicle to commercialise the joint Cardiff / Bath IP and organoid production process. This was based on a business plan developed by the Cardiff team, with Cardiff researcher Dale acting as the company’s Director of Organoid Biology since 2016 **\[5.1\]**. 

 While some companies \(e.g., Stemcell and Merck\) have developed products in the organoid market, ranging from specialist growth media to organoids themselves, Cellesce Ltd was one of the first biotechnology companies to focus on the expansion of stable and reproducible human derived organoids at scale. While other manual methods of organoid culture systems support around 1000 assays per batch, the unique patented bioprocessing described in **\[3.6\]** allows Cellesce Ltd to offer 20\-30,000 assays per batch, importantly containing uniform\-sized organoids. The organoids available through the company are also validated for morphology, size range, viability, drug responses and genetics using techniques developed in the Cardiff lab **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. Further, \[text redacted\] **\[5.2\]**. 

#  4.2 Cellesce Ltd’s value and key partnerships diversifying market opportunities 

 The global organoid drug discovery screening market was valued at $1.45BN in 2020 \(with colorectal cancer worth $136M and breast cancer $500M, *source: Evolution Biosciences*\). Cellesce Ltd, operating from its base at Cardiff University’s Medicentre \(a key University Innovation Hub for clinical and biomedical start\-ups\), is currently valued at £15M **\[5.3\]**. The company reported net assets of £720,841 for the 2019/2020 financial year, a twelve\-fold increase on the £57,486 net assets reported in 2015/2016 **\[5.3\]**. The company has just finished a bridging round of fundraising, with a total of £6M raised in equity, convertible loan notes and grants. The company now employs 11 people \(eight full\-time, three part\-time\) **\[5.4\]**. 

 In 2018, Cellesce Ltd formed a partnership with Repositive, a cancer model platform for researchers in all sectors which allows them to select relevant cancer model systems **\[5.5\]**. Repositive maintains an inventory of more than 8,000 cancer models and 24 contract research organisations \(CROs\). The platform matches researchers with the most appropriate cancer model/CRO, helping accelerate their research. Partnership with Repositive means that Cellesce Ltd products and services are visible to Repositive’s global customer base, almost half of which are in the US. 85% of Repositive’s customers are biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies **\[5.5**, p.6 **\]**. Dr Fiona Nielsen, Co\-founder and CEO of Repositive explained that the collaboration with Cellesce Ltd is “ *making it easier for oncology researchers and data providers to collaborate and speed up the development of new treatments*” **\[5.5\]**. 

 In addition, Cellesce partnered with the Hubrecht Organoid Technology \(HUB\) which hosts a living organoid biobank of more than 1,000 organoids derived from a variety of organs and disease models. Cellesce’s organoid expansion bioprocess is sufficiently flexible that it can be applied to any organoid. Via this partnership, Cellesce’s clients and other HUB licensees are scaling production of HUB organoids via Cellesce’s patented process **\[5.6\]**. This partnership provides significant expansion opportunities for Cellesce, as well as providing benefits for HUB. For example, HUB’s Managing Director Dr Rob Vries explained: “ *HUB organoid technology will benefit from Cellesce’s innovative technology to expand large quantities of organoids such as breast cancer organoids*” **\[5.6\]**. 

#  4.3 Cellesce’s customer base 

 By the end of December 2020, Cellesce Ltd had secured contracts with multiple customers, including pharmaceutical companies \(e.g., GSK, Merck Millipore\), biotechnology companies \(e.g., Emulate Inc\) and contract research organisations \(e.g., Horizon\), with initial revenues of £325K secured at the end of 2019 **\[5.4\]**. For example, Horizon Discovery Group plc is one of Cellesce’s commercial partners with an international customer base of over 2,000 organisations, including major pharmaceutical companies, and a revenue of £58.3M in 2019. Horizon is using Cellesce’s organoids for drug discovery assays **\[5.7\]**; Dr Tim Scales, Assay Services Manager at Horizon explained that the company is “ *developing screens using organoids as…they offer the next\-generation 3D model…which we believe suggests they might offer a better predictive outcome in the clinic*” **\[5.8\]**. Scales confirmed the benefits of Cellesce’s technology: “ *Cellesce have a proprietary bioreactor technology that allows them to produce organoids in far greater bulk than normal*” **\[5.8\]**. He further explained why Horizon selected Cellesce to provide organoids: “ *Cellesce’s technology allows us to overcome the problems of scalability that we require for high throughput screening but also variation between small batches”* **\[5.8\]**. 

 In summary, the Cardiff team applied their research expertise in cancer organoid models to develop a patented bioprocess that forms the intellectual property base of the joint Cardiff\-Bath spin\-out company, Cellesce Ltd. Since its establishment in 2015, Cellesce Ltd progressed from a start\-up to a growth\-phase spin\-out with an estimated value of £15M, supported by new partnerships \(e.g., Repositive\) and customers \(e.g., GSK and Horizon\), who, in turn, command international markets in drug discovery and assay development.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prof Stephenson’s research on gangs in Russian society posed a fundamental challenge to stereotypes of gangs as purely criminal business organisations or substitutes for state power. Instead she has shown that gangs need to be analysed as context specific organisations that develop cultural forms of solidarity, territoriality and gender. Stephenson’s research has influenced the leading Russian NGO, Public Centre for Judicial and Legal Reform, in developing their interregional programme of gang prevention and rehabilitation strategies, which have been rolled out to all 27 territorial justice centres across Russia. Her work has informed public understandings in the West, and challenged conventional wisdoms about criminal organisations, state and society in Russia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Stephenson’s research addressed the rise of criminal gangs in the context of Russia’s transition to capitalism, and their transformation into organised crime groups with tight links to the state. Her research, culminating in a major 2015 book \[R1\] was qualitative in nature, and involved interviews with gang members aged 18\-32, community members, business leaders and representatives of law enforcement in Kazan and Moscow. The research took place over 2005\-2019 and included collaboration with Russian researchers, Aleksander Salagaev, Aleksander Shashkin and Rustem Safin \(Kazan State Technological University\), who were involved in the project design and facilitated access to the research participants. 

 The 2015 book was the first to explore Russian gangs and their transformation as conditioned by the economic, political and cultural changes in Russian society pre\- and post\- market transition. Stephenson showed that many street gangs have developed from neighbourhood alliances offering protection services into serious organised crime groups. While revealing the complex organisation of much of the gangs’ criminal business, Stephenson argued that the gangs, rather than being vehicles for economic operations or substitutes for the absent state authority, develop cultural forms of solidarity, territoriality, gender and leadership. Stephenson’s approach highlights the necessity to approach gangs in culturally sensitive ways, overcoming the US\-centric focus of gang criminology that creates multiple problems for understanding gangs in the non\-Western and global sphere. 

 Stephenson’ research challenges the established view that the gang is a collection of socially excluded and damaged individuals left to survive in the shadow of modern institutions through crime and violence. She demonstrates that a substantial portion of young gang members aspire to mainstream success via the vehicles of employment and education. She argues that by developing these opportunities it is possible to effectively limit the attractions of gang membership. 

 Stephenson’s analysis also shows that, while the gangs’ economic power has weakened in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century as the Russian state strengthened, their social and cultural influence has remained substantial. The book and a 2015 paper in Russian \[R2\] drew parallels between the street gang logic and the behaviour and culture of the Russian economic, cultural and political elites, including President Vladimir Putin’s public use of gang language. The study of deep social and cultural integration of the gang into the Russian society allows for novel considerations about the permeable nature of the borders between formal and informal economies and societal formations in Russia and represents important evidence for business communities, working in the Russian markets, and civil servants, both in the West and in Russia. 

 In her 2016 \[R3 and R4\], 2017 \[R3\] and 2019 \[R5\] papers Stephenson further investigated the gangs’ entrepreneurial ethos and their multiple alliances with the representatives of the state. Contrary to the established views, Stephenson argued that instead of a state monopoly on violence or the subjugation of organised crime by a political elite, in Russia there exists reciprocal assimilation between state and private violent agents. She described the intertwined networks of legality and illegality that work in concert in officially sanctioned and non\-sanctioned ways, reproducing social order. Her approach further highlights the fact that the Russian experience does not fit the global corruption and organised crime paradigms.

 **Influencing gang prevention and rehabilitation strategies** 

 Stephenson’s research has influenced the policies and practice of civil society groups and state organisations in Russia, working to prevent young people’s gang affiliation, rehabilitate offenders and support victims. Stephenson’s research on the causes of youth dislocation has informed several projects conducted by the Interregional NGO “Public Centre for Judicial and Legal Reform” \(PCJLR, Moscow\). This leading Russian civil society organisation has been working in partnership with The State Prosecution Service and the Russian Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice on protecting the rights of the child, preventing juvenile offending and developing restorative justice across Russia. 

 Stephenson has been a consultant to the project, “Territoria” \(2017\-2023\) supported by a Russian President’s grant. The project aims to promote the reduction in violence, intergenerational conflict, and strengthening of positive ties between young people. The project began with a pilot in Kazan, where it involved a collaboration between the PCJLR and the Kazan City Committee on Children and Youth. Stephenson assisted the PCJLR in preparing the grant application and developing the aims, objectives and key activities of the programme. In February 2017 she participated in the training event for schoolteachers, school psychologists and youth workers, discussing the main conclusions of her research and how these can be used in working with gang\-affected young people. The aims of the interventions that the project has developed were based on building young people’s positive links to the community as opposed to the previous predominantly punitive approach to group delinquency. 

 As the toolkit on “Building resilience towards criminal gangs among teenagers” published by the Kazan City Committee on Children and Youth, explains, Stephenson’s research helped the staff of the City Committee in their work. \(S7\) In an email to Stephenson, the head of Kazan city youth psychological services, says, “Thank you for your work that helped us in our project to build resilience towards organised criminal groups among teenagers”. \(S1\).Referring to Stephenson’s support to the Kazan pilot project, the President of the PCJLR says “We introduced school workshops for teenagers in Kazan, where young people learn how to avoid street victimisation. All of this activity drew directly on evidence from Stephenson’s research. The workshops in Kazan involved 427 teenagers. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from schoolteachers”. \(S2\) 

 In 2019, on the basis of the Kazan pilot, the PCJLR set up further gang\-resilience programmes in all of the 27 territorial restorative justice centres across Russia, working with the Russian General Prosecution Service, the courts, youth services and schools. In addition to school workshops with teenagers at risk of victimisation, the programme involved the development of mediation between members of different territorial gangs and street\-based groups, and mediation between offenders and victims. The PCJLR were involved in the training of 5095 mediators \(of whom two thirds were young people\). By the end of March 2020 676 restorative justice programmes were conducted with underage offenders, 652 programmes took place with the victims and 758 programmes involved family members. Altogether 7128 members of the public took part in the programmes. The evaluation of the programme showed that 68% of juvenile offenders who participated in the restorative justice programmes \(victim\-offender mediation and community restitution\) agreed that the outcomes of these programmes were fair; and 75% of the victims also agreed with this \(S2\). The PCJLR distributed copies of the Russian translation of Stephenson’s book “Gangs of Russia” to all territorial restorative justice centres.  In August 2020 Stephenson participated in an online workshop with the leaders of regional programmes, which discussed the further development of the project up to 2023. \(S3\) 

 In a testimonial, the President of the PCJLR says, “Stephenson’s research helps us understand the real motives of the teenagers, their values, clarify the social factors that lead to their marginalisation. We are grateful to Svetlana Stephenson for her detailed study of juvenile crime and the social factors of juvenile criminalisation. Her work helped us to develop family conferences with gang members, and mediation programmes for victims and perpetrators of street violence.” \(S2\) 

 Stephenson’s research also informed the policy of the Russian government on social reintegration of the members of delinquent gangs. Dr Elena Danilova, the Institute of Sociology, Moscow, describes how she used Stephenson’s research in her 2018 report to the Expert Committee of the Russian Ministry of Labour, working on developing the programme of activities within the Russian\-wide “Decade of Childhood” \(2018\-2027\). The programme aims to strengthen the state policies of protection of childhood.  The report “informed the Committee members about the results” of Stephenson’s studies showing that “a proportion of teenagers experience a ‘drift’ from the values of family and school to alternative \[criminal\] values, and that the strengthening of social relations in school and family can prevent such drift. These conclusions were positively received, and as a result of our deliberations we managed to include the development of restorative justice, including mediation and family conferences with …members of delinquent groups and gangs into the government programme.”\[S6\] 

 **Informing the debate in Russia** 

 **Stephenson’s work has informed the debate on gangs in Russia, through invited public talks and media interviews.**  In her lectures and interviews she highlighted the need to develop a more sensitive understanding of gang membership in the Russian context and understand their motives within the context of their marginalisation and the presence of mainstream aspirations among many gang members. 

 Her work has also contributed to a better understanding of the ways in which the criminal culture that flourished in Russia in the 1990s has influenced the wider political culture. In her article in a popular Russian online media resource “Snob” in 2016, the political analyst Maria Snegovaya noted how Stephenson’s identification of key cultural orientations and the worldview of the gangsters have now been replicated within the political establishment, saying that Stephenson “formulated the principles of behaviour of real bandit gangs that perfectly describe the Kremlin policy” \(S8\). Snegovaya’s article was read 15,706 times. The Russian book was also reviewed in a range of widely read publications, including the leading magazine “Neprikosnovennyi zapas” and the popular online media resource “Takie dela”. 

 Stephenson’s research also influenced an art project by the Russian contemporary artist Anton Zimerman in his work on the research exhibition *Moscow – Kazan – Moscow* \(Kazan, 2018, Centre for Research Art\). The exhibition presented contemporary art projects on the history and current development of Kazan.  In his  letter, in which he requested documents about the Kazan gangs for his forthcoming exhibition, Zimerman said ‘Your book “Gangs of Russia”, published in Russian, helped me to form a clear view of the subject of my artistic project’ \(S4\). 

 **Transforming Western understanding of Russian gangs and organised crime** 

 Stephenson’s research has informed a change in Western perceptions of Russian gangs and organised crime, which had previously adhered to Americanised tropes of gang violence. As Tom Porter, International Business Times, discusses Stephenson “penetrated the wall of silence surrounding Russia's gang culture… for a landmark study on the past, present, and future of the Russian mafia,” noting that while some gang members have “graduated to become mafia bosses, responsible for lucrative drugs and weapons trafficking networks,” others were in key positions in business, “security services or in central or regional government.” \[S9\] Stephenson’s research has repositioned the perception of Russian gang membership as purely criminal, with members now utilising the connections and support of a gang to join or progress more established career paths. As an audience member at Glasgow’s “Aye Write\!” literary festival \(2016\) also noted, “it is not poverty or lack of opportunity that drives membership,” but a wider set of criteria including a route to status within the community. \[S5\] The discussion with Laurie Taylor on BBC Radio 4’s *Thinking Allowed,* acknowledged that gangs across the globe had evolved beyond the historical local nexus into social movements, peacekeeping and become institutionalised within corrupt practices of governments and police. \[S10\]

##  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A University of York evaluation of the Drug Recovery Wing \(DRW\) pilots revealed a cliff\-edge of support for prisoners on release into the community, and recommended the development of new approaches that can link effective work in prisons with more substantial support on release. The following impacts have emerged: 

-  The DRW evaluation findings have directly influenced the design of the ten ‘Incentivised substance free living wing’ \(ISFL\) pilots, including the structure, content and ethos of these units. In the region of 3,000 prisoners have now progressed through these wings. Work is underway to expand ISFLs to a further nine prisons. The ISFL initiative was part of \(then\) Prisons Minister Rory Stewart’s 10 prisons projects’ aimed at reducing drug use \(and violence\) in prison. 

-  The Ex\-Prisoners Recovering Addiction Working Group \(EPRA\), chaired by Lord Patel of Bradford, was set up by Professor Lloyd to take forward other aspects of the DRW evaluation findings and its final report was launched in July 2019. The report was warmly welcomed by the Prisons Minister and the Director of Health & Justice Commissioning at NHS England. Plans for the implementation of an EPRA pilot have been discussed at HMP Leeds but COVID prevented any further developments. The EPRA report has also been drawn on in the NHS England RECONNECT programme, aimed at developing support for prisoners following prison release. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The 10 Drug Recovery Wing \(DRW\) pilots were launched by the Ministry of Justice in prisons in England and Wales over 2011 to 2012. Over 2012 to 2016, the University of York \(UoY\) team led by Professor Charlie Lloyd undertook a substantial evaluation of these pilots, funded by the Department of Health Policy Research Programme. The DRWs were set up to get prisoners off drugs and alcohol and reintegrated into communities on release. Our evaluation accordingly sought to identify the factors that facilitated or impeded their operation and their impact on recovery from drug use and offending. We found that while some of these pilot projects showed promise \- involving dedicated staff and highly motivated prisoners \- too often these prisoners faced a ‘cliff edge’ of support on release: many becoming homeless or resorting to living in chaotic hostels, B&Bs, and night shelters. 

 Drawing on his background in research on drug recovery and reconviction, the evaluation was led by Professor Charlie Lloyd as PI at UoY and was carried out in collaboration with Geoff Page and Sharon Grace at UoY, and researchers from the University of Cambridge, and the Centre for Substance Use Research in Glasgow. We adopted a mixed methods design, consisting of three main elements: a rapid assessment, a process evaluation and an impact evaluation. In the course of this work, we undertook and analysed 345 lengthy qualitative interviews; obtained and analysed data from 631 detailed prisoner questionnaires in the impact evaluation; and analysed the data from 1,246 prisoners taking part in the Measuring the Quality of Prison Life \(MQPL\) survey. 

 **The research** 

 The Rapid Assessment consisted of interviews with 97 staff and 102 prisoners \[UoY\]; and an analysis of MQPL survey data to compare self\-reported quality of life on DRWs with the rest of the prison \[UoY and Cambridge University\]. 

 The Process evaluation \[UoY\] was carried out in seven DRWs and involved interviews with 32 staff working in the DRWs and 66 prisoners within a month of release. 58 of the prisoners were eligible for follow\-up, of which 21 were interviewed 6 months later in the community. We also interviewed 27 Recovery Supports nominated by prisoners \(nearly all relatives or partners\). We thereby obtained some follow\-up data on a total of 36 prisoners. 

 The quantitative impact evaluation \[Centre for Substance Misuse Research, Glasgow\] consisted of structured interviews and self\-completed questionnaires at three points in time; on the prisoner’s reception into the recovery wing, prior to the prisoner’s release from the Drug Recovery Wing, and six months after the prisoner has been released back into the wider community. 

###  The Findings 

####  The prison projects: 

-  DRWs did not universally focus on abstinence\-based recovery and the nature and intensity of therapeutic input varied greatly **\[B\]**. 

-  Throughout the study, the abstinence\-based DRWs experienced difficulties attracting prisoners on Opioid Substitution Therapy **\[B\]\[E\]**. 

-  Triangulation of MQPL data and qualitative interviews from the process evaluation showed that three of the DRWs represented promising models that improved prisoners’ quality of life **\[A\]\[B\]**. 

-  Key to these DRWs’ success appeared to be a mixture of physical separation from the rest of the prison; protection of DRW beds for people engaged in the therapeutic programme; a strong sense of community; and good relations between staff and prisoners **\[A\]\[B\]\[C\]**. 

-  Abstinent prisoners on DRWs were keen to avoid co\-location with prisoners on prescriptions for opioid substitution drugs such as methadone or buprenorphine; and the presence of ‘lodgers’ allocated DRW beds, due to their problematic behaviour elsewhere in the prison, could create significant problems **\[B\]\[E\]**. 

-  The presence of uniformed prison officers with little interest or belief in the potential for prisoners to change could also undermine therapeutic endeavours on the DRWs. It was therefore important for DRW managers to have some control over who was allocated shifts to work there **\[B\]\[C\]**. 

-  In all but one DRW, illicit drug availability appeared to be a central problem **\[B\]**. 

####  Impact on drug use and offending: 

-  The impact evaluation found reductions in drug and alcohol use, and self\-reported offending in the six months following release, compared with the six\-month period prior to custody. However, in the absence of a control group, these changes cannot be assigned to the impact of the DRWs **\[B\]**. 

####  Lack of support on release: 

-  A central theme was the lack of support for prisoners on release: most of the process sample reported being met by no\-one at the prison gate and only six reported receiving professional support **\[B\]\[D\]**. 

-  Housing was particularly significant. The most common experience among the process sample was being released to a hostel or funded B&B. Hostels were almost universally regarded as deeply unpleasant and criminogenic **\[B\]\[D\]**. 

-  Specialist family support/recovery workers offer one promising model for increasing and maintaining family support into the community **\[B\]\[D\]**. 

-  To avoid the ‘cliff\-edge’ of support on release, greater use of Release on Temporary License \(ROTL\) is recommended **\[B\]\[D\]**.

##  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Following the publication of the evaluation report **\[B\]**, there were a series of meetings with senior policy makers. In 2017, Professor Lloyd was invited to present on the policy and practice implications of the DRW evaluation at a high\-level meeting of representatives from the Department of Health and Social Care, Ministry of Justice and Public Health England. Later in 2017, he was invited to give a presentation to the Ministry of Justice policy group overseeing the development of a Drug Recovery Prison at Holme House. 

 Through these meetings, and the availability of the report within government departments, there was a clear and considerable impact of the DRW evaluation findings on the design of the ‘Incentivised substance free living wings’ \(ISFLs\), introduced between January and March 2019 in ten prisons in England and Wales \(with a further nine in the process of implementation\). ISFLs originally formed part of Prisons Minister Rory Stewart’s ‘10 prisons projects’ aimed at reducing drug use in 10 pilot prisons. The ISFL ‘Principles for Implementation’ **\[5\]** explains that they were: *“built on the evidence base from the recently published Drug Recovery Wing Evaluation”*. This is verified by four testimonial letters from key individuals, two working at a very senior level of UK government **\[1\-4\]**. For example, HM Chief Inspector of Probation \(formerly at the MoJ\) states that: *“His \[Professor Lloyd’s\] evaluation of the Drug Recovery Wings directly influenced the structure and operation of the Incentivised Substance Free Living wings”* **\[2\]**. 

 Reflecting our findings, the ISFL principles state that to maximise success, ‘discrete substance free living areas’ should be created. Within these, beds should be protected for motivated prisoners, avoiding ‘prisoners receiving high levels of clinical intervention for substance dependency’ \(i.e. opioid substitution drugs such as methadone\). Recognising our findings concerning the impact of ‘lodgers’ on the DRWs, the ISFL guidance also emphasises the need to keep the units ‘as free as possible of non\-ISFL prisoners’ **\[5\]**. 

 Another feature of the ISFL wings that can be clearly traced to our research is the focus on prison officer selection. As the letter from a policy\-maker central to the setting up the ISFLs **\[4\]** attests, our findings were instrumental in the recommendation that ‘Prison Unit staff should be selected for suitability to deliver complementary support and receive further training in drug awareness and treatment’ **\[4\]\[5\]**. Other ISFL elements based on our research include the need to develop a strong sense of community, access to proper support \(including mutual aid\), decent physical conditions, increased family visits, Release on Temporary Leave \(ROTL\) and Home Detention Curfew \(HDC\) and, all importantly, continuity of support and services into the community to avoid a cliff\-edge of support **\[4\]\[5\]**. As the letter from the lead policymaker points out, the DRW research outputs *“were dominant in developing \[their\] learning”,* on which the ISFLs were based **\[4\]**. The letter from the CEO of Adfam **\[3\]** provides further evidence of the role the research played in ensuring that family visits are a key part of ISFLs: *“Professor Lloyd’s research has ensured that rehabilitation – and all importantly, relationships with families – has also formed part of this \[ISFL\] agenda”* **\[3\]**. 

 In August 2020 UoY undertook a survey of prisons with ISFLs, in support of this body of work. Responses from the prisons contacted indicated that the DRW evaluation has impacted on the lives of the estimated 3,000 prisoners who have progressed through the ISFLs. These prisoners will have received much greater levels of support in their attempts to give up their substance use and make radical changes to their lives on release. There may also have been positive impacts for the staff involved with these units **\[C\]** and, potentially, reductions in reconvictions on release, given their positive internal evaluation **\[2\]\[B\]**. Furthermore, it is primarily the rapid assessment and the process evaluation \(both led by UoY\) that have influenced the design of the ISFLs and therefore generated this impact, given the fine\-grained analysis of the structure, operation and ethos of the DRWs that this research provided **\[B\]**. 

  

 The ongoing development of the ISFLs has also been influenced by the work of the Ex\-Prisoners Recovering from Addiction Working Group \(EPRA\) – as evidenced by the Director of Health and Justice’s letter **\[1\]** and, in particular, the lead policy maker’s statement that *“The EPRA project…continues the drive to support men back into the community breaking the perpetual cycle of drug use, prison and potentially premature death”* **\[4\]**. 

 The EPRA was funded through a UoY ESRC Impact Acceleration Account grant, with the aim of using the DRW research findings, together with reviews of the international research \(published online \- [ ](https://www.york.ac.uk/spsw/research/epra/) [<ins>https://www.york.ac.uk/spsw/research/epra/</ins>](https://www.york.ac.uk/spsw/research/epra/)\) to produce cost\-effective through\-care ‘Blueprints’ for the support of substance\-misusing prisoners through prison and into the community **\[F\]**. Chaired by Lord Patel of Bradford, its membership included ex\-Prison Governors, Chief Executives of the organisations delivering treatment in prison \(i.e. potential research users\), senior ex\-civil servants \(including an ex\-Director General\) and academics. Simultaneous meetings with policymakers in the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health and Social Care were also held, to ensure that key decision\-makers were kept abreast of the developing EPRA agenda. The first EPRA meeting was held on 13<sup>th</sup> February 2019 and the report was launched at the House of Lords in July 2019 and was attended by policymakers, politicians, prison governors and voluntary sector CEOs. The audience was addressed by the then prisons minister, Robert Buckland, and the Director of Health & Justice Commissioning at NHS England both of whom welcomed the report and its blueprints. 

 Following the launch of the EPRA report **\[F\]**, there have been two further meetings with NHS England to bring the EPRA work to bear on pathfinder projects for the RECONNECT initiative, focused on care after custody **\[1\]**. The letter from HM Chief Inspector of Probation points to the impact here: *“The EPRA case studies have also proved very influential in the development of the Reconnect pathfinder projects by DHSC”* **\[2\]** *.* The Director of Health & Justice Commissioning at NHS England also refers the influence of the EPRA report in this respect: *“I can confirm that this \[EPRA\] has been useful in helping to develop thinking as to how we...deliver the best outcomes for those patient who are released from prison, in line with the Long\-Term Plan commitment to develop a RECONNECT – Care after Custody service”* **\[1\]**. 

 Finally, there are also ongoing discussions with NHS England and HMP Leeds about the potential for basing an EPRA pilot project on the Leeds ISFL. A meeting was held at the prison on 9 April 2019 between the UoY research team, the Head of Drug Strategy and Healthcare in the prison, the drug services commissioner in Leeds and the Chief Executive of the Forward Trust, one of the main providers of treatment in prison. Discussions have continued, with a meeting between Professor Lloyd, Lead Commissioner, Drug Strategy & Delivery, HMPPS and Security Procedures Lead, HM Prison and Probation Service on 15 December 2019 to talk about the potential for an EPRA pilot at Leeds, but COVID\-19 then intervened.

 *Ray & Liz* is an award\-wining and critically acclaimed feature film written and directed by photographer, artist and film maker, Professor Richard Billingham. Billingham’s debut feature film was released in August 2018 and distributed globally across multiple platforms including cinemas and Amazon Prime.  *Ray & Liz* made a significant contribution to UK cultural life as a critically acclaimed contribution to British social realist cinema, which received 15 international film awards.  The film received further recognition for its depiction of marginalised realities, through specialist awards for socially engaged film making and general media coverage of the issues it raised. The project also extended the reach of Billingham’s ground\-breaking body of family artwork \(usually shown in gallery settings\) to a new, and much wider, global audience.

1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 *Ray & Liz* \( **R1**\) is an independent feature film, written and directed by Professor Richard Billingham, and released in August 2018 to international critical acclaim.   It was the latest in a long series of photographic, video and film works based on Billingham’s own family history.  However, *Ray & Liz* represented an ambitious new development in its use of actors to recreate an autobiographical narrative from lived experience, within the context of a full\-length feature film for general theatrical release. 

 Billingham joined the University of Gloucestershire in 2005.  Since then, he has continued to research and develop the autobiographical work, which began in the 1990s with *Ray’s A Laugh*.  The research phase for *Ray & Liz* started in 2014 and was supported by a 2016 Leverhulme Fellowship \( **G3**\).  Billingham’s 2015 gallery installation, *Ray,* \( **R2**\) also served as a pilot for the full\-length film and became one of three autobiographical vignettes that make up *Ray & Liz.* 

 The research for this project had three main objectives: 

-  To rearticulate a documentary\-based body of autobiographical artwork into a fictionalised cinematic narrative 

-  To work with an extended team of actors and technical experts to evoke the authenticity of an original personal lived experience 

-  To visualise marginalised realities within their historic and cultural context through the medium of a general release feature film 

 In *Ray*, \( **R2**\) Billingham made an initial exploration of the potential of some predominant technologies from the 1970s and 80s, including 16mm film.  This analogue format also offers a 3:4 aspect ratio that suited *Ray’s* roots in documentary photography, as well as the distinctive physical textures \(e.g. wood, paper and fabric\) of the period. He extended this approach with *Ray & Liz* and further reinforced the film’s political, cultural and historical context through visual imagery and sound design, rather than through dialogue or voice over. Authentic recreations of costume, hair and make\-up, regional dialogue, as well as a soundtrack from the same era and ambient sound design, further contributed to the film’s ability to convey the period tacitly. 

 Billingham also drew on earlier video research conducted in zoos across the world, and exhibited in 2006 \( **R3**\), to create a similar sense of psychological and physical confinement in the two films. The UK DVD and BluRay of *Ray & Liz* includes a special feature on Billingham’s work in zoos and how this relates to the film itself \( **R4**\). 

 In terms of working with actors, during the script\-writing process for *Ray & Liz* Billingham returned to a collection of 20 or so audio tapes he made as a boy *.*  These contained recordings that he made of friends and family during the 1980s. The tapes served as a rich set of ‘memory aids’, helped with writing authentic dialogue and, when played to the actors, enabled them to ‘step in the shoes’ of Billingham’s family members. Billingham also interviewed his brother and wrote extensive ‘character backstories’ for each actor to help them authentically recreate family members. 

 The French DVD release includes a 30\-minute interview with Dr Marion Duquerroy of Université Paris 1 \- Panthéon\-Sorbonne, which covers the film’s realist depiction of poverty and contextualises *Ray & Liz* within Billingham’s creative practice as a whole \( **R5**\). A monograph by Dr Kieran Cashell of the Limerick Institute of Technology was published by Bloomsbury in 2020, titled *Photographic Realism: the art of Richard Billingham.*  Chapter 6 deals with the contribution of *Ray* and *Ray & Liz* in detail \( **R6**\). 

 *Ray & Liz* was produced with a budget of £700,000 from the BFI Film Fund and Ffilm Cymru Wales with Big Lottery Money as well as funds from a kickstarter campaign.

###  Audience Interest and Reach 

 *Ray & Liz* was released in August 2018 and screened at 53 high profile international film festivals until October 2019 \- including the *BFI London Film Festival* \(2018\), the *Toronto International Film Festival* \(2018\), and the 56<sup>th</sup> *New York Film Festival* \( **a**\).  The film received a further worldwide theatrical release including: the UK and Ireland \(New Wave\); China \(Hugo East\); France \(Potemkine\); Spain \(Noucinemart\); the US \(Kimstim\); Belgium \(Filmfreak\), and Taiwan \(Cineplex\).  This was followed by international TV, DVD and online distribution across multiple platforms including *Sky, BFI, Curzon Home Cinema, i\-Tunes, Virgin* and *Amazon Prime*. 

 As part of the international programme of festivals, Billingham and the film’s producer engaged directly with cinema goers through ‘question and answer’ sessions at 28 film festivals \(two to three events per festival\).  These included Ficunam \(Mexico\), Jeonju \(South Korea\) and Sevilla Festival \(Spain\) **\(c\)**.  Audience questions in the Q & A sessions, along with private emails to Billingham from members of the public who had watched the film, demonstrated the personal resonance of *Ray & Liz* held for viewers in its authentic depiction of austerity measures, alcohol abuse and childhood neglect \(also see **e**\). 

###  Awards and Critical Reception 

 *Ray & Liz* received 15 international film awards plus a further 23 nominations, including two *British Independent Film Awards* in 2018, as well as a *BAFTA* nomination in 2019 for ‘best debut feature’ **\(b\)**.  It also attracted international critical acclaim, which praised both its artistic contribution to British cinema and presentation of a marginalized social group. 

  

 Upon its official UK cinema release in March 2019, Sight & Sound contextualised *Ray & Liz* within the tradition of British social realist cinema, alongside established film directors such as Ken Loach, Terence Davies and Alan Clarke **\(d\).** 

 In the UK,  [*The Telegraph*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph) described *Ray & Liz* as a ‘darkly funny portrait of a Britain that shouldn’t exist’.  [*The Guardian*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian) hailed it as an ‘extraordinary family album brought to life’.  [*The Times*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times) wrote: ‘the authenticity is bracing, the framing and lighting as striking as you'd expect from a photographer’.  [*The Independent*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent) praised it as ‘unexpectedly moving and touched by grace’. **\(d\)** 

 Across Europe, critics gave a similar response.  In a five\-star review,  [*The Irish Times*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irish_Times) wrote that it was a ‘gruelling uncompromising and beautiful movie’.  [*Les Cahiers du Cinéma*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Cahiers_du_Cin%C3%A9ma) in France rated it film of the month, saying: *Ray & Liz* is ‘a haunting piece \[...\] that conceals the secrets of a solitary childhood""’  [*Télérama*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9l%C3%A9rama) hailed it as ‘gorgeous and melancholic’. **\(d\)** 

 Following the US release, Variety described the film as ‘a rare and remarkable cine\-memoir ... a uniquely moving work of self\-identification and self\-illustration, bristling with pride, anger and even some regret — for the general ugly state of things, certainly, but perhaps for a family he’s come to see, and shoot, a little differently over the decades.’ **\(d\)** 

###  Marginalised realities: informing debates on poverty and social justice 

 The social themes of *Ray & Liz* also led to international recognition of the contribution that a mainstream release feature film can make to debates on poverty and social justice **\(e\)**, as follows: 

-  <ins> *Lux Film Prize*</ins> <ins>shortlist \(2019</ins>.\) This prize is awarded by Members of the European Parliament to films that tackle topical social, political, economic and environmental issues, as well as encouraging debate about values and social issues across Europe. 

-  <ins>SIGNIS Award at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema \(2019\)</ins>. **SIGNIS is a non\-governmental organization aimed at promoting just and truthful portrayals of different groups in society and promoting human dignity, justice and reconciliation** 

-  <ins>Best Film at</ins> <ins> *The Subversive Film Festival*</ins><ins>, Croatia \(2019\)</ins>. The festival jury found it worthy of the award because it is – “…a film which is deeply compassionate, humane and pensive. By exposing the destiny of a single working\-class family, Billingham’s film demonstrates, the devastating impact of the neoliberal economic revolution started by British prime\-minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s which remains highly influential until today.” 

 *Lancet Psychiatry* is a monthly journal for clinicians featuring research, expert review, and provocative comment and opinion in mental health.  In 2016, a preview of *Ray & Liz* by Erica Crompton praised the film’s humane depiction of isolation, alcoholism and poverty. 

 ‘Richard Billingham's  [Ray & Liz  ](http://www.jacquidavies.com/)is the most self\-reflective of films, putting a compassionate spin on his own father, Ray, who lives a life of isolation and alcoholism in a Birmingham tower block. The film continues the storytelling of Billingham's 2001 photographic account of his father collected in the book Ray's a Laugh…the film allows insight into the artist's upbringing and of the life of Ray, a man with an alcohol problem. It does so with such loving care—such as a bedroom scene with the hearty, warm glow of the fire—it can be seen as spiritual.’ **\(f\)** 

 As an article in The Guardian \( *Reality bites: does Ray & Liz avoid the poverty porn trap? 4/3/2019*\) also argued: 

 ‘This is what makes a film such as Richard Billingham’s Ray & Liz so exceptional. It is unashamedly a portrait of white, West Midlands poverty in the Thatcher\-era and, on paper, ticks many of those poverty\-porn boxes: drinking, smoking, obesity, neglect, tattoos, council\-estate squalor…But Ray & Liz is no gratuitous wallow; it is authentic, sympathetic, lyrical, keenly observant and richly detailed….Ray and Liz were Billingham’s real\-life parents, whom he has documented in various forms over the past 20 years…..and Ray & Liz is effectively a moving\-image reconstruction of those images, and of his own childhood. He tells it like he saw it.’ \( **g**\) 

###  Public engagement with Billingham’s previous work 

 The film has also brought public attention to Billingham’s earlier family work. Approximately 20 vintage photographic pieces from *Ray’s a Laugh* were included in the major group exhibition ‘Black Mirror’ at the Saatchi Gallery in London \(September 2018 to February 2019.  Billingham’s earlier work was also included in ‘Hooked’, the inaugural exhibition of the Science Gallery, London \(September to December 2018\) **\(h\)**, a relatively new gallery that aims to connect art, science and public health.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 The European Union \(EU\) is a complex system of governance, in which 27 member states share decisional authority with each other and the EU institutions. The EU’s work is supported by a permanent, multinational civil service, mostly located in Brussels and Luxembourg. The two key bodies are the European Commission \(with 33,000 staff\), and the European Council and the Council of the European Union \(the Council Secretariat or GSC, with 3,000 staff\). Both have staff with a mix of nationality, cultural norms and working practices, and a tradition of strong union power. Any proposed improvement in organisational structure, operation or development can only be made if the case and process for such change is well researched, clearly articulated, and enjoys the confidence of senior management. UEA research led by Professor Connolly and Professor Kassim \(submitted in UoA19\) on the organisation and operation of the EU administration dating back to 2008, has inspired and informed changes in organisational culture and practice in both sets of bodies Their analyses, have increased general self\-understanding of key structures, processes and practices in the two bodies, and helped bring about a cultural change in the Council Secretariat.  The research guided President Juncker’s 2014 restructuring of the Commission, informed the Council Secretariat’s 2016 modernisation programme, and led to a re\-writing of professional standards and codes of practice in the Council Secretariat. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Professors Connolly and Kassim have a long track\-record of research in Public Administration. Since 2008, across four projects, they have produced analyses of the EU administration, based on data collected from large\-n surveys, interviews and focus\-groups conducted in the Commission and the Council Secretariat.  The research made a distinct contribution to EU scholarship in four ways: 

-  **Focus**: whereas much of the literature on the EU is preoccupied with the relative influence of EU institutions in policy making, the UEA team broke new ground in their application of theoretical approaches, models and concepts from political science, public administration and political sociology to investigate, track and explain the operation and evolution of organisational structures and processes in the EU administration, and the mobility, career\-building, socialisation and attitudes of EU civil servants. 

-  **Scope**: While previous studies of the Commission looked at particular groups or structures, or specific departments, these projects examined dynamics across the whole organisation. The three repeat studies of the Commission made it possible to undertake longitudinal analysis of organisational change, and staff beliefs, attitudes and values, as well as the interaction between the two. 

-  **Access**: the team were the first external researchers to be granted full access to the staff of the European Commission and the Council Secretariat. 

-  **Data and method**: the research involved generating new data from large\-n surveys, interviews and focus\-groups, making possible a mixed quantitative and qualitative analysis 

 This body of work was recognised at a senior level in the two key bodies of the EU as the necessary underpinnings for much needed organisational change. The projects are: 

 **The European Commission in Question \(2008\-9\)** funded by the ESRC \(G1\), involved partners from Edinburgh, Konstanz, Sciences Po Paris and UNC\-Chapel Hill. The project reported on a survey of policy\-related staff \(1,901 responses\), supplemented by 209 interviews.  The research provided a critical examination of the new model of presidential leadership introduced by Barroso in 2004, the transformation of the Secretariat General into a personal service of the President, and the impact on vertical and horizontal coordination in the Commission. \(R1, R5, R6\) 

 **The European Commission: Facing the Future \(2014\)** funded by a private research grant \(G2\) involved partners from Edinburgh, Humboldt, and Sciences Po Paris. The collection of data from a survey of staff from all contract groups \(5,545 responses\), supplemented by 245 interviews and 5 focus groups, enabled the team to analyse working practices across and at all levels of the organisation.  The research allowed a comparison of the two Barroso Presidencies \(2004\-09, 2010\-14\), and track the evolution of presidential leadership and its impact on policy coordination and effectiveness. \(R2, R4, R5, R6\) 

 **Understanding the EU Civil Service: the General Secretariat of the Council \(2016\)** included partners from Edinburgh, the European University Institute, Speyer and Sciences Po Paris \(G3\). It generated and analysed data from 1,356 survey responses from staff at all grades and levels, 117 interviews, and 5 focus groups.  The research provided an analysis of the backgrounds, workplace experiences, beliefs and values of staff in the Secretariat, and a comparison with Commission staff. \(R3\) 

 **The European Commission: Where now? Where next? \(2018\)**, funded in part by the UEA ESRC IAA and the EUI, also involved partners from Edinburgh and Speyer. It collected and examined data from 6,500 survey responses from staff at all grades and levels, 210 interviews, and 5 focus groups. The research provided a detailed assessment of organisational and procedural changes introduced by the Juncker Commission, enabling comparison and critical evaluation of different leadership models. As the third wave of data collection, the study made it possible to investigate changes in organisation, management and staff attitudes. 

 This programme of research has studied the experience of working in the EU civil service with a particular focus on leadership, organisational structure, management and HR practices. They: 

-  evaluated the process and impact of presidentialisation on the internal operation of the Commission as an organisation, which enabled the team to identify benefits \(greater focus, streamlining and emphasis on delivery\) and perils \(buy\-in, accountability\) of presidentialism; 

-  showed how the effectiveness of interdepartmental coordination in the Commission depends on the concentration of resource at the political and administrative centres of the organisation; 

-  examined the impact of EU enlargement on values, culture and gender equality, finding that the key experiences and values are similar despite perceptions of difference, and that enlargement contributed to a feminisation of the workforce but did not break the glass ceiling; 

-  explored staff experience of the Council Secretariat and its administrative culture highlighting the Secretariat’s segmented character, and examined the consequences for both individual employees and the organisation. It assessed the effectiveness of hierarchy and other inherited structures and policies, and it evaluated key aspects of personnel policy; and 

-  used matched longitudinal data to explore routes through which pro\-European values and staff engagement can be disrupted by organisational changes, particular types of leadership and shifts in organisational priorities.

 4. Details of the impact 

 At a time of internal change, the then Secretary General, \[redacted text\], with the endorsement of Commission President \[redacted text\], had authorised the research reported in R1, and used the findings to inform her reflections concerning the future development of the administration. As a result, the team gained the recognition and credibility that made possible the subsequent Commission projects and opened the door to the Council Secretariat. Connolly and Kassim co\-led the projects, and Kassim often led on liaison.  While always maintaining academic independence, the team has worked closely with senior officeholders, to whom it has presented early results, in advance of the wider dissemination of overall findings and invitations to address other departments, groups or networks. This relationship was a key pathway to impact, as it created opportunities to communicate findings and hold exchanges on the research. For instance, in 2014\-15 at the invitation of top leaders, Connolly and Kassim made 14 invited presentations, including meetings with the Vice President for Administration, the Secretary General, the Director General for Human Resources and her senior management team to brief them on the findings from the 2014 project. The Vice President for Administration spoke at the launch of the report \(R2\) which was live streamed across the Commission.  In the Council Secretariat in 2016, Connolly and Kassim made presentations to the Secretary General and his private office. They also made a presentation of the findings to a meeting open to all staff which was attended by 300 personnel and viewed by a further 500. In 2018\-19, Connolly and Kassim made 22 invited presentations to audiences in the European Commission including the Commissioner for Administration and his private office \[S1\], the weekly meeting of heads of the private offices of the Commissioners, the Secretary General, the Director General of the HR department, top managers in the Secretariat General and in other departments, the Directors General awayday, and the lunchtime seminar, which is open to all staff. Their work was reported in the staff magazine and the staff intranet carried findings from the project. At the request of the then Secretary General, \[redacted text\], the team prepared a series of special briefings for President\-elect, \[redacted text\], which were among the materials communicated to her on her nomination \[S2, S10\]. 

 Research conducted by Connolly and Kassim has had three main impacts. 

 **1. Restructuring of the European Commission, 2014:** Analyses of political leadership in the Commission, especially the power of the Commission Presidency, the working of the College, and relations between the College and the Commission departments under the two \[redated text\] Commissions, influenced the historic reform of the College enacted by President \[redacted text\], where seven Vice Presidents were given leading roles in upstream coordination. The remodelling was designed to ensure early political policy coordination, strengthen political leadership over the administration, and thereby ensure the effective delivery of the President’s programme. UEA research \(R1 and R2\), research briefings and slides reporting findings from the 2014 project, was used by \[redacted text redacted text redacted text redacted text redacted text redacted text redacted text redacted text redacted text redacted text redacted text\]. 

 As President \[redacted text\] recalls \[S3\]: “ *As I prepared to take office, among the compulsory reading suggested to me by the Secretary\-General of the Commission and my Head of Cabinet at the time, were briefings on the European Commission prepared on the basis of the first two research projects \[\(R1\) and \(R2\)\] …. I found their work on leadership and coordination within the Institution particularly useful in my reflections on how to organise and focus the work of the next College of Commissioners*”.  \[redacted text\] \[S2\] commented similarly: “ *I found Professor Kassim’s work on leadership and coordination within the institution particularly useful in my reflections on how to advise President Juncker to organise and focus the work on the College of Commissioners.  His research provided both some of the justifications and the guidance needed for the \(re\-\)structuring of the Commission by President Juncker in 2014.*” 

 **2.** **Modernising the Council Secretariat, 2016\-20:** UEA research \(R3\) informed the reform programme initiated by the Secretary General, \[redacted text\], in 2016 \[S4\]. In its analysis of the “ *understanding of staff's own perceptions of the organisation*” \[S5, DG for HR\], the Kassim report \(R3\) played an important part in setting the context for the measures. In presentations outlining the reform, the Secretary General cited data from the report \(R3\) as evidence of where action was necessary and the direction of travel supported by staff. As well as showing that staff in general strongly favoured modernisation, it showed particular support for measures to improve coordination and information flows, delayer the hierarchy, and personnel policy reforms \[S4, Secretary General\], “ *to empower staff more, to use participatory leadership techniques … \[T\]he study also identified the lack of a common management culture which we have been working to improve since the study*” \[S5, DG for HR\]. 

 This research led specifically to a reform of the staff appraisal system, and a review of competencies and skill for each main staff group that led to new guidance for managers. As the Head of Staff Development notes \[S6\]: “ *The Kassim Connolly study formed the basis of my team's work to support the review of **management role descriptors, staff role descriptors,** as well as to work on promoting a **common management culture**, **a new policy on staff development** and clearer communication on **career paths**”.* It also led to changes in the Council Secretariat’s Translation Service \(LING\). “ *Following the insights generated by this research … LING \[management\] has introduced certain measures to overcome the shortcomings identified by staff by providing opportunities for staff to break silos and reduce LING's isolation \(1\), to accommodate the need for more and better communication \(2\) and to provide enhanced mobility options \(3\)”.* \[S7, Head of Unit and Director of Translation Services\] 

 More broadly, the research, which was the first project to be conducted by an external team, initiated a cultural change within the Secretariat. As well as encouraging the organisation to be more outward looking, it highlighted the value of listening to the views of staff. Following the 2016 study, an annual staff survey was introduced in the Council Secretariat for the first time *“it helped build trust …staff became much more aware of the issues that faced them and the fact that they could influence them*” \[S8, Office of the Secretary General\]. 

 The findings of the research were circulated internally, discussed by senior staff, and presented to a meeting of all staff, attended by 300 and watched by a further 500 via video streaming, in January 2017.  This was considered key in developing organisational trust “ *Staff confidence in the system was as a result very high, helped by the reputation of the study team for the work they had done previously in the Commission. The openness of the exercise, with the study team presenting their findings in a clear and extensive written report and in an open meeting with staff was an important success factor*” \[S5, DG for HR\]. 

 **3. Briefing the von der Leyen European Commission, 2019\-20:** The 2018 project has influenced the von der Leyen Commission in two ways. First, as the Juncker Commission approached the end of its term in 2019, Connolly and Kassim presented their analyses of the organisational and procedural changes introduced in 2014, and their conclusions concerning possible options for the incoming Commission, to the Secretary General, Directors General, the heads of the Commissioners’ private offices, and the European Political Strategy Centre. Also, as \[redacted text\], \[S2, S10\] noted: “ *I have included Professor Kassim’s work in the briefing materials delivered to Ms von der Leyen*”. Outgoing Commission President \[S3, S10\] confirmed that: “ *As was done for me, I will recommend the briefs from this new project \[The European Commission:  Where now?  Where next?\] as compulsory reading to my successor.  They offer unique insights on the internal organisation of the Commission and its evolution over time – an indispensable asset when deciding how best to prepare the Institution for the challenges ahead”.* 

 Second, UEA research on management and personnel policy over three Commissions has informed planning for the new HR strategy initiated by the von der Leyen Commission in 2020. Following the announcement by the new Commissioner and Director General for Human Resources of a major consultation exercise to inform HR reforms, Connolly and Kassim were invited to deliver three two\-hour Masterclasses to members of Cabinet, HR leadership and managers on: staff recruitment and career pathways; the Commission as a workforce; and organisational change \[R1, 2, 4, 5 & 6, S10\].  The Masterclasses, which were delivered virtually in October and November 2020 and attended by more than 700 people, presented findings and analysis from all three projects. Thanking Connolly and Kassim “ *for the three excellent sessions*”, the Principal Advisor, Professionalisation and Orientation, Directorate General Human Resources and Security, noted that: “ *These events were very well attended, very much appreciated, and extremely useful in terms of reminding staff of the history and progress on people issues in the Commission. Also very useful for our Cabinet colleagues in getting up to speed on these issues. And very useful for me in our work on the HR Strategy, particularly in terms of the consistency of messages across our own surveys, external benchmarks, and your research”* \[S9\]. 

 As external researchers, Connolly and Kassim have been able to pose questions to staff and investigate issues, such as the views of employees on official policies or their beliefs and values, that management cannot. Because the research draws so extensively on the insights and experience of insiders, the findings have authority and authenticity that senior officeholders recognise and value, and are valued for their quality and detail, as well as for their independence and objectivity. In the words of a former Commission President: “ *\[t\]he insights they provide in their work is unrivalled. Even the most well\-informed European think\-tanks and top academic literature cannot match the team's depth of understanding about the Commission”* \[S2\]. In the case of the Commission, the longitudinal analysis that repeat studies have made it possible to deliver has been especially important \[S9\].  The analyses have contributed to organisational development in the two bodies, and helped bring about a cultural change in Council Secretariat. In the words of one official, “ *You deserve recognition for the excellent work done. Your study was a game changer in the GSC”* \[S6, Head of the Staff Development Unit\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case demonstrates how funding, leveraged from national and regional agencies, has stimulated lasting impacts for micro\-businesses, and had far\-reaching implications for the design and delivery of micro\-business support. Newcastle researchers used their collective research expertise on business engagement and micro\-businesses to co\-produce, deliver, and evaluate an innovative intervention with over 130 micro\-businesses and 30 larger businesses in North East England. The intervention partnered each micro\-business with a ‘mentor manager’ from a larger local firm through a series of researcher\-facilitated workshops. It resulted in enhanced capabilities and improved performance over time for the micro\-businesses, policy learning, and enhanced capabilities of ‘mentor managers’. Further research conducted during the COVID\-19 pandemic has supported 20 businesses to build their resilience and adaptability.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research funded by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills \(UKCES\) \(Grant 1\) and the North East Local Enterprise Partnership \(NELEP\) \(Grant 2\) enabled Whitehurst and Richter to co\-produce, pilot and evaluate an innovative short\-term intervention to support the development of micro\-businesses. This was novel research as micro\-businesses \(employing 0–9 people\) are a significantly under\-researched subset of small and medium\-sized enterprises which face particular challenges associated with their lack of resources \(time, people and finance\). The research underpinning the intervention was innovative as it explored how the concept of ‘anchor institutions’ – organisations that in addition to their main function make a strategic contribution to their local economy – can be broadened to include private sector organisations playing a role in their locality by supporting micro\-businesses \(PUB1\). The research\-based intervention, known as ‘Captured’ in its initial iteration, was co\-produced through ‘engaged scholarship’. It was pioneering as it was, to the researchers’ knowledge, the first intervention developed by an academic team to demonstrate that, contrary to received academic wisdom, managers from large firms can play a role in supporting the development of micro\-businesses \(PUB2\). 

 The development of the intervention capitalised on Whitehurst’s research expertise in business engagement \(e.g. Grant 3\), and the role of universities in regional development \(PUB 3\), and built on Richter’s in\-depth qualitative research with small firms \(PUB4; Grant 4\). To enable a practice\-informed approach, the Newcastle team partnered with the SFEDI® Group, the UK government’s recognised Sector Skills Organisation for enterprise and business support, and Leigh Sear, Chief Executive of SFEDI® Solutions Ltd, who has 20 years’ experience of supporting enterprise development at national and international level, to co\-produce the ‘Captured’ model of business support. The ‘Captured’ model involves a short\-term intervention, comprising four half\-day facilitated workshops spaced over two months. For workshops two and three, the micro\-business owner \(MBO\) is paired with a manager from a larger regional firm. 

 The pilot was both facilitated and researched by Whitehurst and Richter, in conjunction with Sear. Through running six iterations of the intervention over the initial nine\-month period of the funding \(Grant 1\) and conducting follow\-up interviews, focus groups and surveys, Whitehurst, Richter and Sear explored how NUBS acted as an ‘anchor institution’, able to encourage private sector businesses in the region to take part; what motivated the micro\-businesses and managers from the private sector businesses to participate; and, most significantly, the learning process through which the MBOs developed themselves and their businesses \(PUB1,2\). 

 PUB5 provides a rare in\-depth empirical study of the learning processes of micro\-business owners, obtained from researching the intervention over a three\-year period. It identifies three key themes in designing support interventions for micro\-businesses. First, the *learning setting,* where universities and business schools have a convening ‘power’ that enables them to recruit both the micro\-businesses and the large firms required for the ‘Captured’ model, and also have particular characteristics that can facilitate openness, honesty and empathy. Second, the *learning process:* the innovative combination of learning opportunities \(one to one with the large firm ‘mentor’, learning from peers, and informal conversations\), based on listening and questioning, feedback and challenge. This was novel, valued, and ‘forced’ the business owners to reflect, which the literature notes micro\-businesses do not usually have time to do. The process was found to offer the challenge and accountability provided in larger firms by non\-executive directors, but rarely experienced by micro\-business owners. The finding that managers from large firms can play a significant role in the learning process is novel as most literature suggests large firms are not an appropriate source of support for small businesses. Finally, the *learning outcomes,* where certain common themes were detected, including gaining a stronger identity as a business owner with more confidence in decision making and renewed focus and drive. 

 The original research has built a community of MBOs to such an extent that from May 2020, Whitehurst conducted further research with 20 of the MBOs: they were interviewed and committed to producing weekly videos reflecting on their experiences during the pandemic.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Across all OECD countries, between 70% and 95% of all enterprises are micro\-businesses, and the figure for North East England is 95%. ‘Captured’, developed through research at Newcastle, was recognised in 2018 by AACSB International \(a non\-profit association which accredits more than 840 business schools worldwide\) as one of 30 initiatives in their ‘Innovations that Inspire Challenge’ \[IMP1\], and the model has had significant short\-term and long\-term impact on the businesses it has supported. It has also been a source of policy learning and awareness and influenced the practices of the managers who have supported the micro\-business owners. 

 **Enhancing the Capabilities of Micro\-Business Owners** 

 Since 2016, ‘Captured’ has recruited more than 120 micro\-businesses owners \(MBOs\), matching them with managers from over 30 large regional businesses, including Virgin Money, Sage plc, HSBC and IBM. To ascertain changes in their capabilities, several weeks after participation the MBOs were asked questions in a survey adapted from the European Union’s EntreComp framework \[IMP2\]. This was completed by 52 participants. As a result of participating, 94% agreed or strongly agreed that they were more able to believe in themselves and keep developing; 88% were more able to ‘communicate a compelling value proposition’; 87% to ‘stay focused and not give up’; 79% to ‘prioritise, organise and follow\-up’; and 88% to ‘reflect and learn from both success and failure’. When asked if they would recommend ‘Captured’ to a fellow MBO, the average score was 9.1 out of 10. 

 Quotes evidencing increased confidence and belief, and a subsequent increase in performance, included the following: ‘ *I’ve been able to take myself and my business more seriously. It has springboarded me onto other areas of work that I had considered were out of my reach’* \[IMP2\#15\]; ‘ *I have been confident enough to put my prices up*’ \[IMP2\#12\]; ‘ *Boosted confidence, made new business contacts, increased sales’* \[IMP2\#21\]; ‘ *Certainly helped me gain confidence and clarity. I’ve learnt to business forecast and plan for events more successfully’* \[IMP2\#40\]. 

 Many participants described how their decision making had improved, and that they had gained a drive to move forward, predominantly emanating from discussions with the manager from the larger organisation. This is identified in these illustrative quotes: ‘ *The process has given me the perspective to make some big decisions and the confidence to push through with them’* \[IMP2\#29\]; ‘ *Captured allows you time to focus on working on the business instead of in the business, with the support of industry professionals who can see the bigger picture and help direct and motivate your actions to achieve success in chosen areas’* \[IMP2\#39\]; *‘Captured has given me a lot more confidence to develop myself and business … I have a far better idea of planning and the steps needed in developing the business’* \[IMP2\#27\]. 

 Micro\-business owners are frequently criticised for insufficient strategic planning, but many participants emphasised the benefits of ‘Captured’ in terms of planning and structuring their business: ‘ *We now have a detailed plan of the growth objectives of the business and the strategy to employ to achieve them’* \[IMP2\#38\]; *‘It’s enabled me to gain some traction developing our business plan and I’m better able to articulate the vision \(and what it means\!\) to my fellow business partners and employees’* \[IMP2\#25\]; *‘My mentor helped me to view the organisational aspect of my company in a very pragmatic way and help to structure how it can move forward in an efficient manner’* \[IMP2\#22\]; *‘We now “capture” our sales figures on a daily basis. This has given us an insight into our performance. It has also enabled us to act quickly if sales have fallen and has given us the confidence to finance more equipment and take on a new member of staff in the run up to Christmas’* \[IMP2\#52\]. 

 Other examples of impact were more personal. A 2019 participant, already coping with long\-term post\-traumatic stress disorder, had permanently lost her speech due to an attack outside her shop in 2018. She was concerned about taking part as she struggled to go to unfamiliar venues on her own but, due to the supportive environment that ‘Captured’ created, she completed the programme. Three months later she sent an email \[IMP3a\]: *‘I thought you would like to know that I won an award this week, the entrepreneurial spirit award at the regional finals of the great British entrepreneur awards … Doing capture \[sic\] has definitely made me realise I do have skills and perseverance that others don't have. It's also given me the confidence to do more.*’ 

 **Longer\-Term Impacts on Business Performance**There is evidence that the impacts of ‘Captured’ are sustained and that business owners attribute the improved performance to their participation. In a follow\-up survey conducted in 2020, participants were asked about changes they had made to their business practices as a consequence of participating in ‘Captured’. Examples included: ‘ *growing class sizes and marketing opportunities. It also gave me confidence to implement changes, for example bringing in new teachers to enable growth’* \[IMP4\#16\]; ‘ *Generally utilising technology more. Installing a practice data management system and diary. Installed new software and harnessed new NHS e\-payments system which allowed us to go paperless for NHS payments. Saving significant admin time’* \[IMP4\#12\]; ‘ *The main change has been in my role where I made a conscious decision to step away from getting involved in every day\-to\-day activity and solving every problem’* \[IMP4\#15\]; ‘ *we import our fair\-trade goods directly from the makers now. This gives us more flexibility and allows us to pay the makers better prices’* \[IMP4\#2\]. When asked whether they had gained customers or clients from participating, 9 of the 16 respondents said they had. Illustrative quotes included: ‘ *Yes without doubt the business grew, we increased our numbers of classes and customers attending by over 20%’* \[IMP4\#16\]; ‘ *I have gained two clients as a direct result of the Captured programme’* \[IMP4\#8\]. Others identified indirect effects: ‘ *I have used the lessons gained to deliver successful pitches for work’* \[IMP4\#11\]; ‘ *Our team has also grown significantly ... Whether this growth is directly attributable to Captured is hard to say, but Captured definitely provided the space to think more about the business and the on\-going conversations with my mentor helped to keep this discipline’* \[IMP4\#15\]. There are examples of longer\-term relationships developing; for example, ‘ *I have continued to work with \[my mentor\] beyond the programme, developing business growth planning and governance. The positive impact on \[the business\] and relationships with my fellow directors and staff has been invaluable’* \[IMP3b\]. 

 **Impacts on regional, national and international policy learning and business support** 

 Regionally, the North East Local Enterprise Partnership has been influenced by ‘Captured’. Their Business Growth Director notes: ‘ *We have been involved with ‘Captured’ from its inception, including providing funding to continue the UKCES pilot and being an integral part of its industry chaired steering group. Seeing the results from Captured, where there was evidence that, contrary to what might be expected, small firms could benefit from being paired with managers from larger firms … encouraged us to be involved in an early pilot of the UK Government backed Mentoring for Growth programme which matches experienced business professionals with the leaders of small and medium\-sized businesses’* \[IMP6\]. The ‘Captured’ intervention was successfully adapted by Whitehurst and Richter as part of a European Regional Development Fund project to work with micro\-businesses in the creative sector, and supported a further 12 micro\-businesses in North East England. In 2019 funding was secured to develop the intervention in partnership with a local charity to deliver it to women in deprived areas across North East England, although this has been paused due to the pandemic. ‘Captured’, as a project funded by UKFP, was required to deliver policy learning for future national business support interventions \[IMP7, p. 27\]. One lesson, specifically from the ‘Captured’ project, was that it was *‘apparent that the larger firms could benefit from being involved in these types of programmes*’ \[IMP7, p. 5\]. A longer\-term evaluation published in 2019 noted that for the larger businesses in ‘Captured’, ‘ *the act of mentoring a smaller business encouraged greater self\-reflection of their own performance or business management practices and helped to keep the larger businesses engaged in the project’* \[IMP8, p. 22\]. Internationally, ‘Captured’ was cited in a May 2018 report by IFF for the British Council as a potential model that could be used during their five\-year Creative Spark programme \[IMP9\]. Overall, ‘Captured’ has become a recognised novel model of micro\-business support, emerging from a small pot of funding, which has leveraged in substantial valuable private sector time. 

 **Influencing the practices of the ‘mentor’ managers from the larger firms** 

 As detailed above, there is evidence from independent evaluations that the ‘mentor’ managers and their businesses benefitted; this is also evidenced by from case studies commissioned by the ‘Captured’ team. Representative quotes from case studies \[IMP5\] show that the managers felt their management practices had been positively influenced by taking part. The Commercial Director of a regional bus company felt ‘Captured’ had *‘highlighted the importance of making time to step back from the day to day operations of running a business, to give yourself headspace and much needed strategic thinking time*’ *.* A lawyer said it had been *‘fantastic for my personal development. To actually be able to apply what I do on a day\-to\-day basis to benefit somebody has been absolutely* *brilliant.’* Another experienced manager said: *‘I know that it built my confidence in my own skill set and the ability to offer good guidance’*. ‘Captured’ also helped the managers understand issues faced by small firms in their supply chain and customer base: *‘The programme has also been beneficial in enhancing my own role at Virgin Money, helping me gain a deeper understanding of the issues facing our supply chain of small businesses*’ \[IMP5\]. 

 **Supporting micro\-businesses through pandemic times** 

 As mentioned above, further research has been undertaken with 20 of the MBOs in 2020. The FSB \(Federation for Small Businesses\) estimates that at least 250,000 small businesses will go out of business in 2021. However, the video reflections produced as part of the research have helped participants build confidence and resilience, adapt to an ever\-changing situation and make difficult decisions which will help them survive. Unsolicited emails \[IMP10\] include comments such as *‘Thank you so much for all your support and helping to build confidence and resilience in we small business owners’*, and *‘It's really useful to keep reviewing and reflecting on this situation and the best way to adapt and progress going forward’.* In the 2020 follow\-up survey, one MBO said that participating in the research was ‘ *like therapy, through the darkest of times and helped me immensely. It helped me clear my mind, assuage my grief and clarify the need to make difficult decisions in the best interests of saving the business’* \[IMP4\#12\].

##  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The 2015\-16 Zika virus epidemic in Brazil illustrates that Community Health Workers \(CHWs\) can be decisive for the success or failure of responses to health crises. Research undertaken at the University of York on health security has radically reshaped CHWs’ response to Zika by: **\(1\)** reframing Zika as a disease of poverty and inequality, especially gender inequality; **\(2\)** advocating health promotion as an empowering practice aimed at social change; **\(3\)** stressing that in order to empower communities CHWs must themselves feel, and be, empowered. Nunes’ co\-produced research – with CHWs, mothers and women’s groups – has led to a comprehensive and scaled\-up programme advancing CHWs’ and community capacity by increasing health knowledge, self\-sufficiency and advocacy skills. The programme involved CHWs in the production of their own Zika knowledge base; placed gender inequality at the core of CHWs’ agenda; and brought CHWs together with associations of mothers of Zika\-affected babies and women rights movements, to promote the future resilience and effectiveness of CHW programmes, through the building and linking of social capital. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 João Nunes’ work focuses on the health risks, insecurities and costs generated by poverty and social marginalisation. Mainstream approaches have traditionally viewed global health as a question of national security, territorial integrity and social stability. Nunes challenges these top\-down perspectives as privileging the standpoint of the nation\-state and powerful actors, pioneering, by contrast, a ground\-breaking **framework of health security as empowerment**. Nunes’ research has demonstrated that the major challenge in developing countries is to deliver dignity at the community level, through improving the embeddedness and capabilities of health service providers **\[A\]\[D\]\[E\]**. To address health marginalisation, Nunes advocates **participatory bottom\-up methodologies** linked with co\-production of knowledge with key stakeholder groups **\[E\]**. 

 Nunes led a programme of co\-produced research on the 2015\-2016 Zika outbreak, declared by WHO a ‘Public Health Emergency of International Concern’, which applied his empowerment research paradigm of health risk reduction. Fieldwork was funded by the **British Council \(Newton Fund\)**, the **Wellcome Trust** and York’s **ESRC Impact Acceleration Account** \(2017\-2019\). This work focused on the lived experiences of citizens on the ground and prioritised enhanced community capacity and resilience strategies of disease prevention **\[A\]**. Nunes co\-produced knowledge with three key stakeholder groups: community\-level civil society movements, community health workers \(CHWs\), and mothers of Zika\-stricken babies in Minas Gerais \- Brazil’s second most populous state with over 20,000,000 inhabitants \(including the municipalities Sete Lagoas, Buritizeiro and Várzea da Palma\). The research demonstrated that the Brazilian government’s response to the Zika virus was a systematic public policy failure at both federal and state levels **\[F\]**, with questions relating to socioeconomic and gender inequalities significantly absent from planning **\[D\]\[E\]\[F\]**. 

 In this context of systemic failure, Nunes identified obstacles that reproduced vulnerabilities and prevented effective policy delivery, related to two core groups \- CHWs and women \- who *also* suffer from intersectional disadvantage **\[D\]\[E\]\[F\]**. In particular, it was shown that: 

  

-  <ins>CHWs a</ins><ins>re</ins> <ins>critical agents</ins> <ins>for</ins> <ins>health service provision for low\-income and other vulnerable groups in communities</ins> **\[C\]**. With the right knowledge and training, CHWs can reduce individual and community inequities in access to essential health services, especially amongst under\-served or excluded populations. However, the Brazilian state and the WHO take the embeddedness of CHWs in communities for granted **\[B\]\[C\]\[D\]**. The research demonstrated that their capacity to deliver effective policies to reduce the spread of Zika is limited by the absence of sustained engagement within communities and lack of specialised training. This results in lack of confidence and motivation, which negatively affects the quality of their work **\[D\]\[E\]\[F\]**. 

-  <ins>W</ins><ins>omen are</ins> <ins>marginalised</ins> <ins>within healthcare provision</ins> **\[C\]**. Yet due to established norms of patriarchy, where women are traditionally responsible for care and work in the family, they are the highest ‘at risk’ group **\[A\]**. Women also commonly dominate low \(or un\-\) paid roles, such as CHWs, in the frontline implementation of vector control programs **\[E\]\[F\]**. 

-  <ins>G</ins><ins>ender\-based violence</ins> <ins>i</ins><ins>s an</ins> <ins>‘</ins><ins>invisible</ins><ins>’</ins> <ins>obstacle to health</ins> <ins>and health care</ins>, which produces and reproduces harm and vulnerability **\[A\]**. Women have limited access to health information, and reproductive, disability and maternal rights, and communities often doubt CHWs’ capacity to provide guidance, assistance and support **\[F\]**. Underpinning this situation is the observation that the Brazilian government has hitherto provided inadequate healthcare information and services to allow for informed decisions about health at the individual and community levels **\[D\]\[E\]**. 

 In short, this convention\-challenging research clearly identifies the unequal and gendered drivers, alongside the effects of Zika, pointing to the importance of addressing individuals’ insecurities through empowerment and capacity\-building, as core solutions to health emergencies.

##  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 word count\) 

 Building upon community\-level empowerment and capacity\-building work with both CHWs and associations of mothers of Zika babies, Nunes’ participative research has improved their collaboration and capacity to exercise agency, leading to improved community health practices and the delivery of more effective health provision and advocacy both for children with microcephaly, resulting from Zika, and their carers. 

1.  **Developing CHWs’ capacities to exercise agency and to build knowledge** 

 With the support of government\-funded FIOCRUZ, one of the world’s leading public health research institutions, and the regionally\-funded public policy research institute, the *Fundacao Joao Pinheiro*, Nunes approached CHWs in two municipalities in Minas Gerais, Buritizeiro and Sete Lagoas. Over a period of two years, they cooperated in the production of usable and accessible knowledge about CHWs’ responsibilities **\[1a\]** and Zika **\[1b\]** – its prevention, symptoms and effects – that was then widely disseminated to target communities through booklets. 

1.  **Scaling up the programme through skills training for CHWs** 

 This work formed the basis of professional\-training sessions, scaling up the programme, to build *“the skills and capabilities of professionals \[…\] and reinforce their potential to respond to crisis*” **\[2a\]**. Starting in the larger municipality, Sete Lagoas \(pop. 236,228\) in 2017, this strategy was then rolled\-out to Buritizeiro \(pop. 28,335\) in 2018 **\[3\].** Co\-producing knowledge underpinned the capacity\-building sessions, enabling CHWs to gain a new confidence in their own ability to provide care, leading to higher levels of self\-esteem and more effective performance of their day\-to\-day tasks. CHWs reported improvements in their knowledge and understanding of Zika and its consequences \(survey results: 77% of participants in Sete Lagoas and 96% in Buritizeiro\). They also stated that the sessions allowed for a more informed provision of services on the ground \(survey results: 89% in Sete Lagoas and 98% in Buritizeiro\) **\[2a\]**. By setting out a skills\-based set of CHWs’ responsibilities towards the community and dispelling commonly\-held myths about how to tackle the disease, the sessions and co\-produced guides had a “ *very positive impact on the motivation and on the quality of the work of the CHWs*” **\[3\]**. Nunes’ work enhanced CHWs’ confidence and control over their professional lives and their ability to provide services on the ground. CHWs stated that they felt more confident to carry out their daily work \(survey results: 72% in Sete Lagoas and 96% in Buritizeiro\) **\[2a\]\[3\]**. The practice guides were adopted by CHWs as an everyday “ *work instrument*” **\[3\]**. Testimonials signed by the Health Secretary of Sete Lagoas, the primary healthcare coordinator of Sete Lagoas and the Mayor of Buritizeiro attest that the project “ *contributed to our \[state\-level\] response to the arboviruses, as well as to improving the quality of the primary healthcare that we provide to the population*”. The Health Secretary of Sete Lagoas recommends that “ *the distribution of the booklet is extended*” **\[3\]**. 

1.  **Placing gender and gender\-violence at the core of CHWs’ agenda** 

 Gender inequalities frequently prevent CHWs from delivering positive health outcomes in both municipalities. **\[F\]**. To address this problem, the research team brought together the civil society women’s movement, *Movimento do Graal*, CHWs and mothers’ associations in Buritizeiro \(May 2018\) and Várzea da Palma \(June 2018\), to identify and discuss individual, group and community\-level problems related to gender norms, perceptions and violence and the ways in which they hindered their agency and advocacy\-capacity **\[4\]**. This process resulted in the co\-production and publication of a third guide on the legal framework and CHW practice regarding violence against women \(December 2018\) **\[5\]**. 

 The guide formed the basis of additional capacity\-building sessions in Buritizeiro \(December 2018\) and Várzea da Palma \(December 2018\) **\[2b\]**. These had a significant impact on increased community\-level dialogue, coordination and solidarity between different policy, practitioner and civil society actors, around issues of women’s health and violence against women **\[8\]**. In the words of a community leader in Buritizeiro, the session “ *gave value to*” CHWs who did not know they were “ *important to the community*” and “ *had never thought of themselves as women who also suffer from violence*” **\[9\].** The sessions led to greater awareness of the different manifestations of invisible violence against women, and of supporting women in denouncing and addressing them. CHWs, in particular, now recognised that “ *violence happens also within families, but it is also in all types of families, and beyond that \[…\] violence happens at different levels*”; and that “ *it is not only about identifying the victims of violence, but rather to observe the context around us. It’s two things*” **\[6\]**. 

1.  **Promoting gender\-responsive health policy for development** 

 Integrating a recognition of the importance of gender\-based violence in shaping health outcomes for women into the everyday practice of CHWs **\[6\]\[7\]\[8\]**, constitutes a major step in developing more gender\-responsive everyday health practices. This heightened awareness of the multiple forms of gender\-based violence and abuse transformed CHWs’ understanding of health vulnerabilities **\[8\]** and improved day\-to\-day health services for the most vulnerable groups within the community \(survey results: 99% in Buritizeiro and 100% in Várzea da Palma\) **\[2b\]**. The practice guide on violence, alongside workshop activities, allowed CHWs to feel more confident in identifying and responding to different types of violence against women in their work \(93% in Buritizeiro and 82% in Várzea da Palma **\[2b\]**\). CHWs also became more knowledgeable regarding the relevant legal frameworks that might assist them in their work \[ **6**\]. Furthermore, the guide is also an important tool for gaining the trust of women in the community. It was disseminated to female end users and enabled them “ *to know their rights, what are the types of violence, what are the legal instruments they may use to combat violence they have been suffering at school, at home, or in the family, or in the various types of violence that they experience in their daily lives*” **\[6\]**. 

 Government officials, health officials and representatives of civil society in Buritizeiro and Várzea da Palma, have confirmed that the gender\-violence guide “ *has become an important work instrument and will be useful for improving their performance on identifying, preventing and facing violence against women and girls*” **\[8\].** As a result of the associated training, CHWs changed their practices in the following ways: they began routinely to convey information about; different forms of gender violence, the health risks women faced from violence, and the support network that abused woman could call upon **\[6\]**. CHWs have changed how they approach women when they visit. In the words of a CHW: “ *when we suspect that the woman has been assaulted but does not want to talk, instead of asking her questions, we give her the guide and then we say: during my next visit, you can let me know what you think of the booklet; or if you prefer instead to meet me at the Family Health Programme we can discuss what you think. In this way we are not being invasive and we are not embarrassing the woman*” **\[6\]**. They also drafted a safety plan for women who were victims of violence **\[6\]**. 

 This change in practice had a significant effect in the community. The guides were disseminated to Primary Health Care units in Buritizeiro, where insights from the sessions were used to organise health promotion and health education activities on issues such as occupational therapy and pregnancy **\[9\]\[10\]**. There are indications that the work has had an impact on the willingness of women to report gendered violence. An interviewee suggested that a reduction of neighbourhood violence was also observed: “ *we had 12 cases of violence in 2018, but in the first three months of 2019 this has already changed, there was a reduction in violence*” **\[6\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Midgelow’s research has changed the way movement artists and teachers undertake and facilitate creative practices, increasing their understanding and confidence. Dance practitioners have been enabled to appropriately articulate their embodied practice, such that they have the skills to recognise, reflect and communicate movement and choreographic processes. 

 Focusing on Artistic Research in Doctoral Education she revealed gaps in awareness and provision, identifying a need for a co\-ordinated approach across academic and arts sectors. This research has changed perceptions and practices, increased opportunities and informed developments in both arts and education contexts in Finland, Ireland, Sweden, and the UK \- in particular with Dance4 \(UK\). 

 Her work has benefited dance artists, students and teachers, arts organisations and HEI’s, with impacts found in: **\(1\) Creative Practice, \(2\) Provision for Artistic Doctoral Education \(3\) Arts Sector thinking and practices**. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Midgelow’s research in the field of practice\-as\-research \(PaR\) focusses on epistemologies and research methods in dance and improvisation \[3.1 and 3.2\] and how these are manifest and supported within the frame of doctoral education \[3.5\]. 

 The first strand of Midgelow’s research in PaR has been an investigation into the significance of articulation, embodiment and languaging in PaR. This research led to the development of the ‘Creative Articulations Process’ \(CAP\) with collaborator, Emerita Professor Jane Bacon, University of Chichester. CAP has its beginnings in a research project led by Midgelow and Bacon at University of Northampton between 2005\-2008, \(£62K ACE\) with leading artists, including Anna Furse \(Goldsmiths University\), Guy Dartnell \(freelance theatre artist\) and Gill Clarke \(Independent Dance\) in which we explored ways of making, sharing and revealing movement practices. 

 The first iteration of the CAP model was published in 2014 \[3.3a\] \(following Midgelow’s move to Middlesex University in 2012\). This article sets out the underlying principles/practices of CAP which are located in somatically informed movement/improvisation practices, focusing techniques \(Gendlin, 1978\) and the discourses of PaR. The model has since expanded through a series of research\-intensive workshops and mentoring, as documented in the video, ‘Creative Articulations Process: A Rhizomatic Practice’ \(2020\) \[3.3.b\]. This video exposition sets out CAP as a multi\-modal, rhizomatic, process incorporating three areas of work, Preparations, Ground Form and Expanded Form, and six facets – opening, situating, delving, raising, anatomizing and outwarding. As a non\-linear movement/writing process it offers insights into and develops capacities for, dual\-attending, tracking, creative discernment and languaging/writing. CAP enhances creativity, offering a self\-reflexive and embodied method for artistic enquiries. 

 Using the CAP model and exploring it as a mode of performance, led to two performance works: ‘Skript’ \(2013\-2014\) \[3.4a\] and the spoken choreography ‘BreathBone’ \(2019\-2020\) \[3.4b\].  These two works were co\-produced by Dance4, Nottingham as part of their NottDance Festival. These works manifest writing/speaking in improvised, collaborative, felt and bodily modes, creating intimate performative events that evoke somatically aware, mindful and reflective spaces for audiences. 

 The second strand of Midgelow’s work investigates the undertaking and supporting of PaR within the frame of a doctorate. This area of doctoral education had received little direct attention with no prior research into the specific processes, or the learning experiences of candidates, in the fields of dance and performance. To address this lack, in 2016 Midgelow established ‘Artistic Doctorates in Europe’ \(ADiE\) \(Erasmus\+ £316K\). ADiE is a collaboration between Dance4, Middlesex and Chichester Universities \(UK\), University of the Arts, Stockholm and Weld dance house \(SE\) and Helsinki UniArts, Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Arts and Zodiak Centre for New Dance \(FI\). 

 ADiE research used both qualitative and practice research methods. This led to a series of case studies and publications, notably, ‘Reconsidering Research and Supervision as Creative Embodied Practice: Reflections from the Field’ \(2019\) \[3.5a\], which offers insights and guidance to candidates and supervisors, proposing a creative, co\-relational process, and incorporating partners beyond the academy in the development of ‘third spaces’ for doctoral engagement. The edited collection, ‘Research \(in/as\) Motion: A resource collection’ \(2019\) \[3.5b\] includes contributions by an international group of 46 authors including leading scholars and PhD candidates. It combines epistemological, philosophical and creative/pedagogic approaches, revealing ways to work effectively with tacit knowings, attend to the complexities of situated knowledge and the centrality of first person, enskilled, research.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In advancing the conceptualisation of practice in the sphere of academia/postgrad pedagogy, and the application and dissemination of these in both academic and \*non\-academic\* contexts, Midgelow has transformed spheres of both creative practice and HEI education, providing processes, benchmarks and an aspiration in respect of what constitutes rigorous practice procedures and effective environments. Her specific approach to PaR as manifest in the ‘Creative Articulations Process’ \(CAP\), her guidance for PaR doctoral studies and advocacy for these knowledges, have generated impacts in three key areas: 

####  1\) Impact on creative practice 

 Midgelow has supported artists to engage with and employ research processes that were previously confined to PgR/academic contexts. She has contributed to the changing nature of the dance professional field which, in non\-commercial sectors, have become increasingly ‘researcherly’ in approach and hybrid in terms of careers pursued, with Dance4 noting Midgelow has supported “a generational shift in dance development activity” \[5.7\]. Developing CAP, she has provided new skills and creative methods to the benefit of such dance artists in the UK and internationally. The research has been shared online and in video, workshop and written modalities, including courses in Brazil x2, Argentina, Taiwan, New Zealand, Sweden, USA and UK, attended by c.200 movement artists/educators, deepening the significance of the initial publication of this work in 2014. The online materials at choreographiclab.co.uk have received 1,261 av. visitors per month \[5.8\] 

 Dance artists report using CAP in their creative processes note how their writing, creativity and abilities to track and make informed choices have been enhanced, stating for example:  “\[CAP\] provides me with a way back to the body, a way to track and consider my choices and to offer up a push to avoid getting stuck”;  ‘It’s given me a breathable structure to support and expand my creative processes. And my everyday awareness’;  “It helps me …to understand why I’m doing what I do and bridge the gap in translating practice where so often language feels so inept” \[5.1\]. 

 In 2019, following an open application process, 12 artists began the in\-depth ’CAP catalyst’ training,  in fortnightly sessions and mentoring. These artists are applying CAP to diverse practices/contexts  – from skateboarding \- promoting “an acceptance of, and authentic connecting to, that which is happening” \[5.2. Abulhawa\] – to supporting children in care – offering a “way to play and notice and receive ourselves” \[5.2 Mahenthiralingam\].  Whilst COVID has restricted the extent of the facilitation of CAP by these artists, they describe how CAP has provided a new structure for solo making, clarity to mentoring and tools in writing, surprisingly perhaps, supported funding application processes \[5.2 Catalyst Artists reflections\]. 

 CAP has also informed the work of emerging artists and students through its incorporation into HEI curricula. Documented users are found at: Ohio State University, Taiwan University, UNICEN \(Argentina\), UNICAMP and UFBA \(Brazil\), York University \(Canada\), UCLAN and Royal Holloway \(UK\). US Prof Zungia\-Shaw \(Ohio State\) states that she teaches CAP to her students as it offers them a structured, yet “radically permissive”, space for making creative work. Students at her university are using CAP in diverse forms, including dance\-technology and classical Indian dance. Canadian artist\-scholar Cheryl LaFrance \(York University\), notes that “CAP helped me to see a way forward for developing a pedagogical approach to teaching writing skills to dancers’, describing one of her participants as saying ‘she was able to tear down die Mauer im dem kopf \(the wall in the head\) between her creative and writing processes”. These examples from teachers evidence how CAP has enabled meaningful changes, providing a method to support those teaching and undertaking creative practices \- increasing confidence and enhancing capacities through the scaffolding CAP provides \[5.2 Shaw & LaFrance\]. 

####  2\) Impact on Provisions for Artistic Doctoral Research 

 Generating an international community of practice, Midgelow has benefited dance artists undertaking PaR / Artistic Doctorates and informed HEI provisions in UK, Ireland, Finland and Sweden. Her work has \(i\) enhanced connectivity, opportunities and mobility \(ii\) increased the awareness of providers as to the requirements of artistic doctoral programmes. 

 These impacts have been achieved through the advocacy and activities of the Artistic Doctorates in Europe \(ADiE\), both in the process of the research itself \(for partners and participants\) and in its legacy and continuation by others. ADiE reached c.4600 people across Europe and beyond, with stakeholders including research candidates, supervisors, universities, dance organisations and funders/policy makers. Between 2016\-19, these stakeholders participated in seven events \(each 1\-5 days duration\) \(c.310 participants\), plus two 5\-day teaching\-intensives \(33 candidates\) and stakeholder surveys/ feedback processes \(240 respondents\). ADiE has reached all of the major providers of Artistic doctorates in Dance in the UK and the Nordic Countries. 

 The significance of the work of ADiE is further indicated by invitations to speak at sector leading events, including keynotes at the Nordic Dance Research Association 2017 and 2019, DanceHE 2016, UKCGE 2017, Visioning the Future: Irish Doctorates 2020, ELIA Advancing Supervision 2020, reaching c.700 participants. In addition, ADiE web resources have some 226 av. visitors per month and we have had 1,469 vimeo viewers \[5.8\]. 

#####  2.i\) Enhanced connectivity, opportunities and mobility for candidates 

 ADiE offered the contributing partners and participants connectivity and mobility; provided opportunities to deepen and diversify relationships; created spaces to model new approaches and lead to new performance bookings of work by doctoral candidates. 

 An international group of 33 candidates \(selected from 68 applicants\), from across Europe and one from USA, attended the ADiE teaching intensives \(March & June 2018\) – the first of a kind directed specifically to doctoral candidates in movement practices, offered without fees and with travel grants to enable participation \[15 full/part bursaries\]. Participants stated they had “more confidence to make the art making my starting point”. Such impacts, whilst at the level of the individual are highly significant, for as another user / participant reports the ADiE events offered an “opportunity to have extraordinary encounters that have widened my perspectives on what research is and how to go about it. I feel supported, empowered and extremely enthusiastic to apply myself and my research into making a positive impact unto the world"" \[5.3 p.11\]. 

 Recognising the benefits of mobility and collaboration for doctoral provision as a result of ADiE, UniArts Stockholm and Helsinki “now operate almost as ‘sister’ institutions”, with exchanges happening at all levels – from Professor and PhD  – with involvement in each other’s doctoral projects and attendance in the sister school’s PhD courses \[5.4\]. A Berlin group arose from the ADiE intensives and meets regularly. This is significant as Germany has far fewer opportunities for artistic doctorates in dance than is now possible in other European countries \[5.5\]. 

 Other significant partnerships that have been activated by ADiE are; UniArts Stockholm with professional performance venues, Weld and New Moderna Dans Teater; and, Kiasma Theatre, Zodiak Centre for New Dance and UniArts, Helsinki.  The Stockholm based partnership have since 2019 supported five doctoral seminars, four research presentations and a conference, ‘How Dance Thinks’. While the Helsinki partnership has co\-curated events and drafted bids for the Kone Foundation, promoting collaboration in artistic research between academia and the creative industries since 2017 \[5.4 & 5.5\].  These activities realise ADiE’s aim to create ‘third spaces’ beyond the academy, which has required changes in professional arts spaces/programming \(see point 3 below\). 

 Midgelow shared ways to adapt supervision practices during the pandemic in two events – firstly convening an ADiE zoom call \(May 2020\) and then as an invited participant with ELIA \(July 2020\). These generated new ideas and framework conditions to create a positive impact for online provisions in dance. 

#####  2.ii\) Influencing the delivery and development of artistic doctoral degrees 

 ADiE has influenced developments in the design and delivery of doctoral education in HEIs,increasing understanding of the requirements of/for artistic research methods and building confidence in supervision / examining. These impacts emerge from ADiE’s work on supervision and its ‘Recommendations for Action’ \(2019\), which set out 16 required actions across four key areas: Doctoral Education, Supervisor and Examiner Training, Infrastructure and Environment and Impact. These actions are available in five languages 9 and have been the subject of multiple invitations to present internationally. The impacts are felt at the level of the individual, with supervisors being better placed to support candidates, stating for example, I have “more personal confidence to beginning to support research candidates” and “I will be more confident in suggesting strategies to my \(prospective\) students”. Whilst others noted: “It made me think about how I might create a better supervision environment”. ADiE focused on bringing candidates and supervisors together into a shared understanding of the supervisory process and as such it is significant that a candidate also noted that they felt able to: “have a discussion with my supervisors about better support for my practice, ensuring they are available for practical upgrade” – evidencing improved agency arising from engaging the ADiE research \[5.3. p.11\]. 

 research \[5.3. p.11\]. 

 Impacts in the HE sector also arise via follow\-on projects such as ‘Visioning the Future: Artistic Doctorates in Europe’ \[€40K, National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education\]. The lead investigator notes that this project arose directly from ADiE and that due to ADiE there is now a community who understand more about the international ecology and distinctive pedagogies of Artistic Research, describing how ADiE’s research is being taken forward into the unique ecology of the Irish context. The sector guidance/resources ‘Visioning the Future’ is developing for candidates, supervisions and examiners re\-use ADiE research and materials extensively \[5.6a&b\]. 

#####  3. Impact on Arts Sector thinking and practice in relation to artistic research and doctorates, in particular with Dance4. 

 Midgelow/ADiE increased the awareness of artistic research/doctorates and challenged conventional attitudes within the UK arts sector, stimulating debate among stakeholders as to the value of artistic research for professional arts organisations and for the public, contributing to changing perceptions and increasing understandings of PaR in dance generally, and of doctoral education specifically. 

 Impacts and follow on developments are particularly evident in the work of Dance4, a leading UK dance organisation with whom Midgelow has collaborated as an artist\-researcher, co\-supported three doctorates \(inc. 2 AHRC CDA awards, completed 2015\), and as Vice Chair of Dance4 Board of Directors \(2013\-2019\). These collaborations can be seen to crystallise through Dance4 becoming an ADiE partner in 2016.  Dance4’s Director \[5.7\] describes how they felt enabled to test and embed new ways of working as they moved away from a focus on creation/presentation, toward a programme invested in artistic research. Since this change, they have reached some 20K participants and supported 170 artists per year to engage with research\-led dance. Through working with Midgelow in ADiE,  Dance4 note they “developed the necessary skills, capacities and experience to develop provision to support practice as research degree projects”. Through Midgelow’s work Dance4 have become “advocates for the greater acceptance of doctoral research, working with funders to see the context of doctoral education as brilliant opportunities in the careers of individual artists”. They also applied to the AHRC \[AH/S008888/1\] to embark on a sector\-led collaborative doctoral programme. Whilst not\-successful the bidding consortium now newly support doctorates, with DanceXchange and Birmingham City University developing a Collaborative Award. Plus, they supported over 20 artists to explore PhD proposals and had countless discussions with artists in the context of ongoing research relations with Dance4, and, embedded artist research and doctoral support into their envisioning plans in collaboration with DanceXchange. 

 Similarly, Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Arts, Helsinki, \(the primary arts gallery in the Nordic region\) have, since ADiE, incorporated performance events and talks by artistic researchers, adding PhD/post\-doctoral presentations into their programme and thereby bringing artistic research to a public, including work by Tuija Kokkonen, Pilvi Porkola and Pauliina Hulkko. 

 Such activities arise from changes in perception, and the new skills and knowledge these organisations now have available to them. These are key to the development, integration and sustainability of dance as an artform. Working with Midgelow has embedded research practice into Dance4 which “has undoubtedly created change in our work”,  giving them a “competitive edge” in the dance sector \[5.7\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 People with Parkinson's \(PwP\) experience a range of disabling symptoms that fluctuate and evolve over time. Research by Dr Annette Hand at Northumbria University has shown how informal carers of PwP continuously adapt by adopting new and challenging roles, often at a cost to their own health. This can result in PwP moving into hospital or formal care earlier than if their carers had been better supported. Hand’s research has been used by the charity Parkinson’s UK in their policy engagement \(including recommendations for a NICE toolkit to support neurological conditions\) and led to the new Parkinson’s Connect support service for PwP and their carers, which is rolling out across the UK. A new Parkinson’s recording template on the NHS electronic patient record system SystmOne has also been created, so that care of PwP explicitly includes their carers. As a result of these innovations, carers feel more supported, have better access to services and are able to care for PwP in the community for longer. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Parkinson’s Disease \(PD\) is the second most common neurodegenerative condition in the UK, with 18,000 people being newly diagnosed each year in the UK and a prevalence predicted to reach over 168,000 by 2025. People with Parkinson's \(PwP\) can experience a range of distressing and disabling symptoms that progress and fluctuate. 

 While the symptoms and treatment of PD are becoming better understood, research led by Dr Annette Hand at Northumbria was the first to focus on how symptoms of PwP are being managed at home, including the roles and characteristics of informal carers. Supported by colleagues from Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, the research established that 80% of PwP who live at home do so with informal care support, with the average age of caregivers being 71 years old \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. This informal care saves around GBP70,000 per person from health and social care budgets, but can have significant detrimental effects and strain on the carers – particularly as they are ageing themselves – including on their mental health \[ **R2**\]. 

 The Northumbria Care Needs Project began in 2014, a collaboration between Hand and Parkinson’s Disease Northumbria \(a nationally recognised NHS specialist Parkinson’s service\). This project investigated the care needs of PwP at home and in care home settings, and the impact of the condition on both the PwP and their carers. This mixed methods study involved 164 PwP, including 115 patient\-carer partnerships with moderate to advanced PD and 49 PwP without an informal carer, all still living at home. A range of validated quantitative outcomes were measured at the beginning and again two years later, including: demographics, disease status, frailty score, quality of sleep, quality of life, and mental health \[ **R1**\]. 

 An additional 114 variables, based on a stress appraisal model, were measured for carers, including: coping strategies, personality types, roles and activities undertaken, the extent to which formal care mechanisms were in place, and a relationship assessment \[ **R2**\]. In\-depth interviews with ten carers of PwP who had gone into care home placement during the study period built on the quantitative data to further understand what led to the need for referral. In care homes, PD symptoms can be difficult to manage effectively because of the challenges of balancing effective medication with drug side effects \[ **R3**\] and the fact that care home staff sometimes fail to recognise the fluctuating nature of PD, which can lead to missed care needs \[ **R4**\]. This results in PwP experiencing worse outcomes and higher mortality in care homes. Maintaining a healthier home environment for both PwP and their carers, for longer, is therefore vital. For the first time, factors in care journeys that could predict care home placement were characterised \[ **R1**, **R4**\- **R6**\]. 

 The research highlighted that PwP without a carer access formal care more quickly and comprehensively than people with an informal carer \[ **R1**\]. PwP\-carer partnerships adopt adaptive *ad hoc* strategies at home, with the caring role developing slowly over time. Carers learn to manage complex fluctuating motor symptoms, psychological issues, and the pragmatic aspects of caring at home, typically with very little professional support. This puts strain on both the carers themselves and their relationship with the PwP. This strain often goes unnoticed by formal services until the partnership has reached crisis point, necessitating admission to hospital or care home placement \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. This research therefore highlighted the essential need for formal services to interact with, and support, informal carers much earlier in their care journeys. 

 This research \[ **R1**\- **R6**\] was funded by Parkinson’s UK \[ **G1**\] and was the first study in the UK to have explored holistically the care needs of PwP \[ **R1**\], and the role and characteristics of informal carers \[ **R2**\]. It also examined the relationship between hospital admissions and care home placement \[ **R5**\]. It identified that increased social support could reduce the risk of hospital admission for PwP \[ **R4**\] and established carer strain as an important factor behind care home admission \[ **R6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Hand, a clinical academic with 23 years of experience in the field of PD and strong stakeholder connections, formed a key bridge between Northumbria University and practice in PD, both locally and nationally. Her position as a clinical academic was critical for delivering impact from the research. As a result of a lack of research into the caring needs of PwP, the support services available to carers were limited and inconsistent. The research undertaken at Northumbria had an impact on service design, practice, and policy, with subsequent improvements for PwP and their carers alike. 

 **4.1 Impact on Parkinson’s UK’s support services** 

 Parkinson’s UK is the biggest charitable organisation focused on PD and its treatment in the UK, covering all 300 NHS specialist Parkinson’s services nationally. In 2018, based on her research expertise, Hand was appointed as the nurse lead on the Parkinson’s UK Excellence Network, which develops and shares best practice across the UK, to improve the care for PwP and their families. Hand has also served on Parkinson’s UK’s Excellence Network Underserved Group since 2015, a taskforce created to provide a strategic, nationwide approach for those who miss out on support. 

 Hand’s research underpinned the redesign of Parkinson’s UK’s support services, which has led to the introduction of the Parkinson’s Connect service \[ **E1**, **E2a**\]. This aims to provide support to PwP\-carer partnerships. The service is the first in the UK to offer educational, emotional, physical, and psychological support to carers – as well as family and friends of PwP – from the outset of the carer journey, independently from the PwP. This is the first formal recognition of the role of the carer as a valued partner to the care system to keep PwP at home for as long as possible. Users of the services can self\-refer \[ **E2b**\] or be referred by professionals at any point and have access to support via various forms of communication, including website, text messages, phone calls, printed information, podcasts, and face\-to\-face conversations. 

 Parkinson’s Connect is now an integral part of the NHS care pathway advocated by Parkinson’s UK. Implementation is currently underway in Northumbria, Cornwall, and North East London. This is part of a plan to extend it to 10 NHS services – reaching 15,000 PwP – by the end of August 2021 \[ **E1**, **E2b**\], and to the whole of the UK from late 2021, although the expansion has been slower than anticipated because of the COVID\-19 pandemic \[ **E2**; **E1**, p2\]. 118 people \(91 PwP and 27 carers\) were referred at diagnosis between January 2020 and December 2020 and received additional individualised support \[ **E1**, p3\]. Implementation barriers and facilitators are being systematically recorded and will inform the roll\-out of the service nationally. 

 In addition, in 2019, Parkinson’s UK’s Underserved Group created a leaflet titled ‘Caring for your resident with Parkinson’s’ \[ **E3a**\] to give guidance to care homes on how to look after PwP in their care homes. The content featured contributions from Hand’s research \[ **R4**\], including information on the importance of residents getting their medication on time \[ **E3a**, p8\] and looking out for their mental health \[ **E3a**, p7\]. Almost 1,600 printed copies of this booklet have been distributed and it was viewed more than 500 times online between November 2019 and November 2020 \[ **E3b**\]. 

 **4.2 Impact on national policies and guidelines** 

 One of the key functions of Parkinson’s UK is to campaign for better care for PwP and regularly respond to Government consultations. The Head of Policy and Campaigning explained that *‘Results from Annette’s research have been incorporated extensively into Parkinson’s UK policy and campaigns work’* \[ **E1**, p1\] *.* This includes Parkinson’s UK consultation responses to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence \(NICE\) guidelines for supporting adult carers \(NG150, 2020 \[ **E1**, p1\]\) and for treating chronic sialorrhoea, a problematic secondary symptom of PD \(2019, TA605, \[ **E1**, p1\]\). 

 Hand’s research demonstrated that informal carer mental health worsened as a result of being a carer \[ **R2**\]. Evidence from this research informed an All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) made up of professionals, PwP, and their advocates, demonstrating dissatisfaction with current mental health services. The final report, ‘Mental Health Matters Too’ \(2018\), referenced the research findings \[ **E4**, p39\], highlighting the need for carers’ mental health to be taken into consideration. As a direct result of the research, the report recommended that *‘carers and family members should be supported in addressing their own mental health concerns by \[healthcare\] professionals and should be signposted to Parkinson’s UK support services’* \[ **E4**, p30\]. This now includes Parkinson’s Connect \(as above\). 

 These research findings were then included in Parkinson’s UK’s co\-development of the NHS RightCare Progressive Neurological Conditions Toolkit \(2019\) \[ **E1**, p1\]. The toolkit was supported by NICE and created to support health systems understand the priorities in care for those people who are living with neurological conditions, including PD. Hand’s research mainly fed into the Mental Health support content \[ **E5**, p8\], which acknowledged the importance of meeting the mental health needs of carers. 

 **4.3 Impact on PwP and their carers** 

 The findings from Hand’s research and the publication of the recommendations in the APPG ‘Mental Health Matters Too’ report led Northumbria Healthcare Trust’s Parkinson’s Specialist Service – which runs clinics in the region to support 1,600 PwP – to incorporate a new Parkinson’s recording template on the nationwide primary care recording system SystmOne, used as part of a broader move away from paper\-based systems in the NHS. Hand created the template based on her research, and it includes a systematic and proactive assessment of caring arrangements and carer strain under ‘Social Changes’. There is now a clear identification of care needs, facilitating advanced care discussions and addressing carer issues such as strain and mental health, which were not previously considered. In order to ensure coordination, all General Practitioners \(GPs\) and other healthcare services can access the template, which is currently available to 96 GP practices in the North East. The new process prompts referrals for formal care and embeds carers’ assessments, enabling PwP to remain at home for as long as possible, or ensuring a smooth transition into a care home. This benefits informal carers, ensuring their needs are being met by a more carer\-friendly NHS. Between April 2017 and November 2020, a total of 1,315 people have been entered as carers in SystmOne \[ **E6a**, **E6b**\]. Being identified as an informal carer then facilitates further interventions to help reduce strain both for the PwP and carer. Examples include referrals to the Parkinson’s Connect service \[ **E6b**, p1\], social services, talking therapies \[ **E6b**, p2\], and befriending services that allow PwP and their carers to have some time apart \[ **E6b**, p3\]. Following the success of this regional work, Parkinson’s UK is currently developing a national template for primary care, although the roll\-out has been delayed by the ongoing COVID\-19 pandemic. 

 Offering consistent, responsive, and direct support to carers as a result of Hand’s research has meant a great deal to carers under strain. Carers often struggle with the guilt of taking care of themselves, and as a result, are often tired, overwhelmed, and in need of respite. A \[text removed for publication\] is the carer for her husband \[text removed for publication\], who has complex PD, is now unable to walk and needs support with many medications and personal care. Since 2015, they have been part of the Northumbria Care Needs Project. Since the role of the carer has been formally recognised, she now feels: 

 *‘that when we come to clinic how I am doing is just as important as how \[text removed for publication\] is doing … I am made to feel a very important part of the care team and I know I can talk to \[Annette\] about anything, and this support is my lifeline. We talk about how I am coping and managing and that makes such a difference to me … Knowing that there is someone that takes my needs into consideration too and really does care about us both makes such a difference and has really helped me to continue in my caring role for \[text removed for publication\]’* \[ **E7**\]. 

 M \[text removed for publication\] is the main support and carer for his wife, who was recently diagnosed with PD. They were referred to the PD Connect project and received trustworthy and up\-to\-date information and advice. 

 *‘We now understand that it is very important to support each other and for me to provide reassurance and positivity when required … I am grateful that this support \[from a partner or someone\] is acknowledged by the project by taking the time to make sure that we are supported as well’* \[ **E8**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Over half of the UK’s pre\-schoolers are ‘fussy eaters’ and less than 20% eat the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables. We know that limited diets have significant adverse health consequences including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Research at Loughborough University has identified strategies to improve children’s eating, which underpin the UK’s first evidence\-based digital child feeding guidance \(the ‘Child Feeding Guide’\) for parents/caregivers and professionals and curriculum content for healthcare/childcare training. The guide has 1\) been adopted by NHS as the main advice for parents/caregivers across the UK; 2\) improved the ability and practice of >100,000 parents/caregivers and healthcare/childcare professionals to support children’s healthy eating, and 3\) improved the eating behaviours of children in the UK. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Unhealthy or restricted diets during childhood contribute to numerous preventable health conditions for children and the adults they become. Fussy or restrictive eating \(e.g., just eating beige foods\) and not eating enough fruit/vegetables affect over 50% of children, yet many families and caregivers \(including healthcare and childcare professionals\) do not know how to manage this, often implementing behaviours which our research has shown can unintentionally worsen the situation.  Fussy eating behaviours in children can also cause anxiety and stress in caregivers, which further perpetuates the problem. 

 Parents/caregivers report needing evidence\-based guidance about which health\-promoting feeding behaviours to use with their children. Haycraft and Witcomb’s research has furthered knowledge and understanding of the role that parents/caregivers play in feeding their children. The research underpinning the impact was conducted at Loughborough University between 2001–2018.  All of this research has informed the development of the Loughborough University Child Feeding Guide digital guidance.  Six illustrative research examples are highlighted here. 

 Our research initially identified factors that impact food preferences and intake in adults and how these are influenced by the way in which they were fed as children by their parents/caregivers **\[R1\].**  Further work revealed the impact of parental feeding behaviours on children’s food preferences and intake, highlighting the formative role that parents/caregivers have in shaping children’s eating habits from birth **\[R2\-R6\].**  Notably, this research exposed a **disparity between the information available to those feeding children** \(e.g., parents, caregivers, childcare professionals, healthcare professionals\) **and what was known by academics/researchers about how best to facilitate the development of children’s healthy eating habits \[R3\]**. It is well established that poor dietary preferences in childhood are associated with adiposity and a range of adverse health outcomes in adulthood, meaning that **early intervention is vital**.  Our research highlighted an essential need to improve the way that information is communicated to parents, other caregivers, and professionals to improve child health **\[R3\].** 

 This underpinning Loughborough University research investigated how children’s eating habits are impacted by parent/caregiver use of adaptive \(healthy, responsive\) and maladaptive \(overly controlling, neglectful or indulgent\) feeding behaviours. This research has made novel, impactful discoveries including identifying, for the first time, a link between controlling feeding and young children’s emotional eating **\[R4\]** and the importance of parental role modelling for promoting children’s healthy food intake **\[R5\].** Importantly, both studies highlight how parent/caregiver behaviours can be easily modified to promote healthier eating habits in children. 

 Haycraft and Witcomb have also extensively explored which mealtime behaviours can reduce children’s fussy eating **\[R2, R3, R6\]**, to understand how to encourage diverse food consumption.  Moreover, research led by Haycraft piloting a family\-based intervention \(2012\-2016\) for the first time revealed a variety of child\-based and environmental factors which drive parents’ feeding behaviours.  This research resulted in the identification of key behaviours to target for intervention and support **\[R2\].** 

 Together, Haycraft and Witcomb’s research has advanced our understanding of how parents/caregivers feed children and which modifiable behaviours need targeting to support them to improve their feeding practices and thereby facilitate healthier child outcomes.  These research findings underpin the Child Feeding Guide \(CFG\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impacts claimed flow from our research findings which have identified strategies that improve child feeding behaviours to support children’s healthy development **\[R3, R4, R5, R6\].**  The **pathway mechanism** from research to impact is the Child Feeding Guide digital guidance \( [www.childfeedingguide.co.uk](http://www.childfeedingguide.co.uk/)\), produced at Loughborough University. **The CFG has led to the following impacts.** 

 **1. Child Feeding Guide adopted nationally within NHS resources** 

 Following a rigorous approvals process, the CFG was selected for adoption by the newly\-launched ‘NHS Health Application Library’ which provides trusted online health tools for different user groups. Notably, the CFG was the sole source of guidance on child feeding included in the new library. From there, the CFG was added to the NHS Start4Life resources which are the NHS’s primary source of digital guidance and support for families and professionals. Use and recommendation of the CFG by NHS healthcare professionals across the UK is evidenced by testimonials, personal communications, and requests for flyers to share with patients/clients, and the CFG is also a recommended support resource on NHS Trust webpages \(e.g., Dorset Healthcare *Maternal and Child Nutrition Guidelines*; Hampshire CAMHS *‘Eating Difficulties’ resources*; and resources shared by NHS City and Hackney, NHS Mid\-Cheshire, NHS Northern & Eastern Devon, NHS Ayrshire and Aran, plus others around the UK\). **\[S1\]** 

 The CFG’s reach to over 100,000 users **\[S2\]** was achieved via targeted promotion in key outlets \(e.g., the Institute for Health Visitors publication\), invited presentations / webinars / workshops \(e.g., to the Scottish Government’s Family Nurse Partnership conference; Primary Care and Public Health Conference\), through media engagement and dedicated social media accounts **\[S3\],** and accelerated via positive public feedback **\[S4, S5\]**, for example: 

 *“Anyone with a \#fussy eater should visit the @ChildFeedGuide website. Great, practical tips on positively approaching picky eating”* \(Clare Baseley, Registered Nutritionist\) 

 *“We love this @ChildFeedGuide website compiled by researchers at Loughborough University. It's full of practical tips and tools to help deal with fussy eaters.  A fantastic resource for parents and Early Years workers alike\!”* \(Mairi McLachlan, High5ForFruit\) 

 *“It has all the basic information that a parent might need”* \(Nutritionist\) 

 *“The @ChildFeedGuide provides “real strategies and tools to tackle fussy eating and create happy mealtimes””* \(Nottingham College\) 

 **2. Improved ability and practice of parents, caregivers, and professionals to support healthy eating behaviours in UK preschool children** 

 Our research identifying the feeding behaviours linked to optimal child outcomes has underpinned much\-needed provision of guidance and support for over 100,000 different stakeholders **\[S2\]**. 

1.  **Parents and caregivers** 

 Before the creation of the CFG, parents/caregivers reported an absence of information, guidance or support about how to feed children once children start eating solid foods. The CFG addresses this need and supports parents/caregivers, first, to change their understanding about how best to feed children, which parents attest to: 

 *“I didn't realise how much I used food as a reward so these \[tips\] have been great to change that.”; “Knowing what is normal is reassuring. There are lots of opinion\-based websites that are not based on fact which can be misleading when looking for information.”* **\[S4\]** 

 By providing parents/caregivers with opportunities for personal development, through educating, informing, and changing their awareness, this brings about improved feeding behaviours.  Parent JB commented: *“We have already started taking the pressure off my 4\-year\-old son and mealtimes feel less stressful for me\!”*.  And another parent explained that the CFG: 

 *“…made me think a lot about portion size and I stopped making her finish what’s on her plate…I didn’t think we had any real issues but now I think we did but I didn’t recognise it. It’s made me think differently about food.”*  **\[S4\]** 

1.  **Healthcare and childcare professionals** 

 Our research has also increased the ability of healthcare professionals \- including nurses, nutritionists, dietitians, and health visitors working across the UK **\[S1\]** \- to support families to feed children responsively. Nutritionist Charlotte Stirling\-Reed said: 

 “*The information contained within the Child Feeding Guide and provided by these subject experts underpins many of my current practices and the recommendations I share with families”.*  **\[S6\].** 

 The CFG meets professionals’ need for “ *evidence\-based, independent information … in front line practice*” \(Public Health Nurse\) **\[S5\]** which is also novel \( *“Innovative thinking*\! *”*\) and accessible \( *“This is an excellent resource tool and parents can access information via the internet \- this info is credible and accurate”*\) **\[S5\].** Healthcare professionals also report that the CFG addresses a previously un\-met need as there are no other credible, comprehensive, sponsor\-free resources available to support families with feeding children: 

 *“I work with parents and I now feel I have reliable information about fussy eaters to share”* – Health Professional; *“This is an excellent resource tool when so many parents are accessing info via the Internet”* \- Health Visitor, Belfast, Northern Ireland; *“I love it\!\!\! It's been so helpful, I can happily say it's independently produced :\)\) The clients have found it informative and it has helped them to feel that they were making changes and helping their children in a way that works for them. … It has really helped me to support my clients in feeling they are being listened to. Thank you”* \- Specialist Community Public Health Nurse. **\[S5\]** 

 Registered nutritionists Julia Wolman and Charlotte Stirling\-Reed commented that their ability to support healthy eating behaviours in UK infants, toddlers and preschool children had increased as a result of using the CFG: “ *This helpful website has enhanced my knowledge and understanding of how to effectively feed children”* \[JW\] and *“Having this evidence\-based, accessible support and information is so valuable to professionals like me for keeping my knowledgebase current”* \[CS\-R\] **\[S6\].** CFG training was endorsed for CPD by the Association for Nutrition, with the assessor commenting: 

 *“Many nutritionists’ work involves children, and how to persuade them to eat a healthy diet is important. However, this is an area not generally covered in detail in university nutrition courses, meaning that newly qualified nutritionists often have to learn about this vital area ‘on the job’. The in\-depth and practical nature of the course will mean that inexperienced nutritionists will be able to acquire a sound and evidence\-based grounding in best practice.”* **\[S7\].** 

 Awareness around how best to feed children has also increased in childcare professionals, who report that benefits from using the CFG include changing their understanding of fussy eating and \- consequently \- their mealtime interactions with children they care for: *“The way in which we approach children at eating times \[has changed\]”.* 

 Childcare staff now know how to change their behaviours to improve children’s eating: “... *raising staff awareness of the impact their behaviour towards food can have on children*” **\[S5\]** and pre\-post data from a representative sample of nursery staff **\[S8\]** demonstrated increased modelling of healthy eating habits, teaching children about nutrition more often, and re\-offering refused foods after engaging with the CFG training. These are all responsive feeding practices which our research **\[R5, R6\]** has shown promotes children’s healthy development. 

 Following positive feedback and outcomes from Children’s Centre staff \(commissioned by Rushcliffe Borough Council\) who used the CFG training, the Loughborough University team was approached as subject experts for support to tailor Nottinghamshire Public Health team’s activities as part of the UK Government\-funded obesity Trailblazer campaign.  Fussy eater training was identified as a key need by early years settings and the public health team recognised the expertise of the Loughborough University research team.  Although roll\-out was delayed due to COVID\-19, the CFG training has been licenced for use for children’s centre staff and early years professionals \(EYPs\) within childcare settings across Nottinghamshire, with Andy White, Public Health Officer, commenting: *“The research and development you and your team do is vitally important to raising knowledge and standards in the early years so we want to support this as much as we can”* **\[S9\].** 

 **3. Children’s eating behaviours have improved across the UK** 

 Our research has generated positive changes in UK children’s eating behaviours. We have shown that children’s eating habits can be a significant concern for parents **\[R2\]** who have requested help to improve this. The CFG has solved this issue for families. 

 Use of the CFG by parents/caregivers has been associated with significant reductions in children’s fussy eating behaviours.  For example, parent NNK said *“I have a fussy eater who is now 4 and very stubborn but improving with your advice”* and a mother of a 3\-year\-old reported that using the CFG had *“helped with \[her child’s\] fussy eating”,* while a Twitter user needing guidance on improving their child’s eating behaviours reported that the CFG was *“helping already\!”* **\[S3\]**. 

 Another CFG user shared: *“Hooray\! Littlest little one has finally decided that this soup stuff is actually edible. Yesterday she ate a little, today ‘I love soup’, \[it’s\] only taken 2 and half years of trying\!\!\! This great tool from @ChildFeedGuide can help you keep track of offerings”* \(SugarSwaps\) **\[S3\]**.  Further evidence from some of the Child Feeding Guide’s >100,000 users demonstrates that repeated offering of a food, as advocated in the CFG based on our research evidence **\[R2\]**, results in positive changes in children’s behaviours \- where they go from refusing foods to accepting and eating foods **\[S10\]**. Together, this highlights how use of the evidence\-informed CFG has improved UK children’s eating behaviours.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Roussos’s research into federated entity identification systems for the Internet of Things has led to the development of Recommendation ITU\-T Y.4805, a worldwide standard for global information infrastructure set by the International Telecommunications Union. Recommendation ITU\-T Y.4805 has enabled a growing number of Smart Cities to operate more efficiently, benefiting their citizens and businesses. Notably, the Recommendation provides the core ingredient in the Smart City strategy adopted by the Smart Africa Alliance, a partnership between 30 African countries. The Recommendation has also provided the basis for further work within the ITU’s IoT and Smart City study group \(SG20\), with Recommendation ITU\-T Y.4459 also building on Roussos’s work, and several other Recommendations directly building on its provisions. The resulting suite of ITU\-T standards provide the blueprint for Smart Sustainable City infrastructures implemented across Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 A Smart City incorporates information and communication technologies \(ICTs\) to support the delivery of essential services such as energy, transport and utilities. To work effectively, Smart Cities require a comprehensive and robust system of entity identification, enabling them to distinguish universally unique items such as artefacts, products, assets and buildings. Many such systems exist; however, they are typically incompatible, and some operate in direct competition. This results in expensive duplication of labour and resources due to lack of reusable solutions, slowing down innovation. 

 Roussos’s research into the Internet of Things \(IoT\) and its applications for Smart Cities stems from an investigation into item\-level network RFID \(Radio\-Frequency IDentification\) systems \[1, 2\]. Network RFID systems are used to track objects automatically and remotely without human intervention, and work carried out by Roussos with collaborators at the Universities of Tokyo and Melbourne, UCLA and Athens University of Economics and Business \[5\] made seminal contributions towards: \(i\) the design of novel software architectures to address the unique requirements of open large\-scale RFID systems, incorporating movement analytics; and \(ii\) the development of in\-depth understanding of the multiple ways in which user control must be exercised over such systems to compensate for their unsupervised and transparent operation. 

 This research into Network RFID was further extended to incorporate IoT\-based end\-to\-end low power Internet Protocol networks at full scale, which highlighted the need for an inclusive approach to entity identification \[3\]. Moreover, it delineated the challenge of dealing with an extensive range of existing Universally Unique Identification \(UUID\) schemes such as Object Identifiers \(OID\), Electronic Product Codes \(EPC\), ITU mu\-codes \(μ\-code\), JPN u\-codes and numerous others, as well as the use of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for the same purpose \[5\]. 

 Roussos identified the need for a scheme that would be capable of seamlessly supporting the integration of these artefacts into Smart City systems while at the same time supporting scalable and secure operation. To address this, his 2011 paper \[4\] reporting on research carried out in the CASAGRAS2 project in collaboration with ISO/CEN AIDC Standards expert Paul Chartier, proposed and demonstrated a fully\-functional and extensible identifier\-locator resolution scheme which places no restrictions on the choice of identifier or locator specification. The paper describes the main features and elements of this scheme and identifies its main performance characteristics, demonstrating through an experimental testbed how they meet the requirements for very large\-scale implementation across national borders. Further, the paper specifies a process by which legacy UUID schemes are integrated, thus making the scheme backwards\-compatible with existing technology. Finally, the paper reports on the outcomes of an investigation into the operational and maintenance issues related to the resolution and meta\-data discovery of such identifiers by a globally available online service. 

 Overall, \[4\] demonstrated that the proposed federated entity identification scheme leads to a secure and scalable solution for the provision of such services, using a testbed which implemented the proposed approach and measured its effectiveness under actual traffic patterns and load encountered online. This approach is applicable to practically any standards\-based or proprietary UUID specification, incorporating those established for different types of RFID and IoT verticals, and supersedes previous proposals such as the Object Naming \(ONS\) and the OID Resolution Service \(OID RS\). Legacy system support in particular is demonstrated by incorporating the long\-standing artefact identification scheme specified under ISO/IEC 9834: a mapping is defined that facilitates the embedding of OID Unique Item identifiers within the address space specified by the Handle System, an Internet standard for digital entity management \(RFCs 3650, 3651 and 3652\); novel RFC 3652 data\-types are formalised so as to address common information provision needs in this setting; and related operational and application considerations are outlined. The research showed that the approach supports object mobility; fine\-grain security that is compatible with international Smart City requirements, especially with regards to governance; open, global reach; and multiple domains of control at the item level. The approach also shows superior scalability with regard to both identifier address space and traffic load compared to ONS and OID RS.

 Birkbeck was the project coordinator for this grant, which included partners from Brazil, mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Russia, Malaysia and the USA. Its goal was to facilitate international cooperation supporting the European agenda for realising the concept of the Internet of Things, recognising the need to do this in a way that was compatible with the global context. 
","
 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Roussos’s research on large\-scale interoperable entity identification systems \[3, 4\] fostered collaborations with researchers worldwide through the CASAGRAS2 project, notably at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives \(CNRI\) in the USA, under the leadership of Robert E. Kahn \(one of the “Fathers of the Internet”\). In 2010, Roussos presented to CNRI his research on augmenting the Handle System to incorporate IoT\-enabled physical entities. Invented by Kahn, Handle is best known as the technology that underpins the Digital Object Identifiers \(DOI\) assigned to scholarly publications. Moreover, the extensions to Handle proposed by Roussos involved the federation of proprietary and open universally unique IoT identification schemes \[4\]. These discussions informed work undertaken by CNRI in cooperation with ETIRI, the research institute of the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, in response to the widely publicised incident in 2008 where a number of infants were poisoned by milk formula adulterated with melamine. Their solution involved a nationwide tracing platform based on federated integration, which permits purchasers to track the formula they are purchasing from production plant to shelf. The system was introduced in Guangdong Province \(China’s largest province, with a population of 113 million\) in June 2014. ‘By the end of that year, the number of registered handles for this application had exceeded 92 million’ \[C\]. The use of this system become mandatory nationwide in 2015 as a requirement of Chinese food safety law, and has influenced practice globally. In February 2020, French brand Danone announced plans to expand its use of this system from China to its French, German, Australian and New Zealand markets. 

 **Impact on global standards for Smart City infrastructures** 

 Roussos’s publication on federated entity identification systems \[4\] brought his research to the attention of the International Telecommunications Union \(ITU\), the United Nations’ specialist agency for information and communication technologies. The ITU sets global standards for such technologies through the issue of Recommendations, which ‘act as defining elements in the global infrastructure of information and communication technologies’ \(itu.int/about\). With IoT technologies becoming increasingly widespread, the ITU deemed it necessary to provide regulation and guidance in this field. Interoperability was a key concern: the ‘divergence \[of IoT platforms\] has led to an urgent need for stakeholders to come together to mitigate the risk of data ""silos"" emerging’ \[A, *Unleashing Potential*\]. 

 In March 2015, Roussos was invited to chair a plenary event on emerging trends in the IoT and Smart Cities at the ITU headquarters in Geneva. The event was attended by key IoT stakeholders including senior executives of device manufacturers and the telecommunications industry and led to the formal decision to establish a new ITU study group, Study Group 20 \(SG20\), focusing on the Internet of Things and its applications including Smart Cities and Smart Communities. SG20 formally convened in October 2016 to address this challenge and to ‘support the creation of an inclusive, interoperable IoT ecosystem capable of making full use of the data generated by IoT\-enabled systems’ \[A, *Unleashing Potential*\]. SG20 continues to operate today, with Roussos in the role of Associate Rapporteur on one of this group’s ‘key areas of activity’ \[E\], namely a work package on end\-to\-end connectivity, networks, interoperability, infrastructures and Big Data related to the Internet of Things and Smart Cities and Communities. This represents ‘a central part’ of the work of the study group as a whole \[A, *Unleashing Potential*\]. 

 Roussos’s research \[4\] was accepted during the inaugural meeting of SG20 in 2016 as the basis for a new work item with the code ITU\-T Y.SC\-Interop \(‘Identifier service requirements for the interoperability of Smart City applications’\). This work item was developed by SG20 over the following year before being accepted by the ITU in August 2017 as Recommendation ITU\-T Y.4805 \[D\], enabling a growing number of Smart Cities to streamline their delivery of essential services as part of ITU’s global suite of Internet of Things standards. 

 Recommendation ITU\-T Y.4805 specifies the functionality for federated entity identification services in Smart City applications, ensuring that such systems are interoperable and secure. Federation is achieved through the specification of Service, Data, and Operation Models. The Service Model specifies the structure of the identifier resolution infrastructure, including detailing its components and the relationships between them. The Data Model defines the data structures necessary to represent identifier attributes in the Smart City context, as well as security and operations. The Operation Model describes the essential operations that should be provided by the identifier service, as well as features crucial to facilitating cohesive, transparent and trustworthy operations that integrate different identifier service components as required. 

 Roussos’s research \[4\] continues to contribute to the ongoing work of SG20. In January 2020, a further Recommendation was accepted: Y.4459, which details the concrete implementation of Recommendation Y.4805. 

 **Impact on Smart Cities in China and the Smart Africa Alliance** 

 As attested by DONA, an independent international foundation whose mission is to foster interoperability across global information systems, Roussos’s work and the associated development of ITU\-T standards has helped tremendously in the adoption of DOA \[digital object architecture\] technology in many application fields. The Operations and Planning Department \(OPD\) of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Bureau \(TSB\) confirms that Recommendation ITU\-T Y.4805 addresses a key challenge in emerging Smart City systems by establishing the foundation for seamless interoperability across already deployed legacy devices and new and emerging naming and identification schemes. For this reason, there is strong interest in this Recommendation, with exploratory implementations initiated in China and by the Smart Africa Alliance. 

 The Smart Africa Alliance unites 30 African countries \(with a total population of approximately 750 million people\) and is concerned with implementing, monitoring and evaluating the SMART Africa Manifesto. This is a formal commitment to facilitate socioeconomic development on the continent through access to broadband and the use of ICTs, which was approved by the African Union \(comprising 53 states\) in 2014 and which has overseen the introduction of numerous Smart City initiatives across the continent. In 2016, the Rwandan government formally linked the country into a system based on Recommendation ITU\-T Y.4805 and operated by DONA. Jean Philbert Nsengimana, Minister for Youth and ICT, identified the importance of the system for the secure management of information in the government’s programme of digital transformation: ‘There is loss of information or it ends up in the wrong hands. \[This\] system addresses such issues. It is about interoperability, flexibility, scalability and simplicity for information handling for the future. It will help us to better manage information in a way that is resourceful to our citizens’ \[F\]. In 2017, the Rwandan government launched a year\-long pilot project in collaboration with Inmarsat, Ericsson and Intel, aimed at transforming the country’s capital Kigali. A total of 67 innovation projects included applications in farming, transit, security, and water distribution, the latter aiming to prevent sanitation\-related disease causing the death of 2,000 children annually. The project has progressed to full operational implementation providing the focus for foreign collaborations and investment including $50 million from the UAE\-based Cheikh Rakadh Group for the implementation of the Masterplan. 

 Also in 2017, the Rwandan government unveiled the Smart Cities Blueprint, intended to accelerate Smart City creation across Africa. The Blueprint offers guidance on planning Smart Cities and refers explicitly to the standardisation work of SG20, as well as examples already implemented in Rwanda and elsewhere \[G\]. One such example, presented at ITU SG11 in 2017, saw the introduction of an anti\-counterfeiting system to electronic device supply chains. The system integrates UUIDs from distinct legacy identification systems such as GSM and IEEE 802.3 to provide a unified application infrastructure and prevent reuse of unlawfully obtained devices \[K\]. 

 At the Beijing Development Forum in 2017 \[L\], the Chinese City of Chengdu presented their implementation of Recommendation ITU\-T Y.4805 as the foundation for their deployed Smart City infrastructure. In their deployment, entity identification services are used to unify access to all city assets including transportation and communication networks, public spaces and government buildings. It integrates diverse identification schemes relevant to verticals using Recommendation ITU\-T Y.4805, which is viewed as offering a considerable advantage over alternatives. 

 **Impact on Smart Sustainable Cities** 

 Recommendation ITU\-T Y.4805 is one of a number of ITU standards deriving from the research in \[4\] and the work of SG20, which together set out specifications for the design and maintenance of sustainable Smart Cities worldwide. A Project Officer at the ITU Standardization Bureau, identifies Y.4805 as an exemplar of ITU standards on Smart Sustainable Cities \[H\] where interoperability needs to be ensured among heterogeneous and distributed systems in SSC.  According to the same presentation \[I\], cities designed in accordance with or currently working towards the blueprint established by ITU standards including Recommendation ITU\-T Y.4805 are: Dubai \(UAE\), Singapore, Valencia \(Spain\), Wuxi \(China\), Foshan \(China\), Kairouan \(Tunisia\), Montevideo \(Uruguay\), Maldonado \(Uruguay\), Manizales \(Colombia\), Pully \(Switzerland\), Guangshan \(China\), Bizerte \(Tunisia\) and Moscow \(Russia\). 

 The changes made as these cities work towards the Sustainable Smart City standards have benefited their citizens in diverse ways. Singapore’s Outpatient Pharmacy Automation System used robotics and RFID technology to automate the delivery of patient prescriptions in the pharmacy setting, eliminating the possibility of human error in prescription delivery and thereby improving patient safety. The city of Pully introduced ICT to its water network and was able to conserve water by detecting leaks more swiftly. Moscow’s Project Magistral tracked commuter patterns and used the information to redesign its suburban public transport network, resulting in a 50% increase in passenger numbers and helping the city to move from being the second most congested in Russia to a position outside the top 20 \[M\]. 

 The Director of ITU\-T identifies the growth of Smart Sustainable Cities as a core ingredient in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: 'Smart Sustainable Cities will contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by leveraging information and communication technologies \(ICTs\) to set cities on a development course characterised by environmental sustainability, resilience, and equitable social and economic growth.' \[A, *Shaping Smarter*\] The McKinsey Global Institute further quantifies the impact of this work: 'Cities that use smart technologies effectively can make significant progress in quality\-of\-life dimensions such as time saved, health and safety outcomes, environmental impact, and social connectedness and civic participation, improving some key metrics by 10\-30 percent. These issues directly touch tens of millions of lives... we found that smart technologies can reduce fatalities by 8\-10 percent, accelerate emergency response times by 20\-35 percent, shave the average commute time by 15\-20 percent, reduce the disease burden by 8\-15 percent, lower greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions by 10\-15 percent, and reduce water consumption by 20\-30 percent.’ \[J, p.35\]

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Giblin’s curation of the exhibition *Tremble Tremble* for the Irish Pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennale, 2017 \(approximately 850,000 visitors\) and its related events – an international five\-venue exhibition tour, launches and book publication – contributed to broader public awareness of the politics of abortion in Ireland and the national conversation on women’s rights. Publicity generated through media coverage and visits by high\-profile individuals such as the President of Ireland highlighted the power of contemporary art to communicate topical urgencies when experienced alongside important political events. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Giblin’s curatorial practice engages with the relation between installation and topical socio\-political issues. *Tremble Tremble* \[3.1\] was commissioned in 2016 for the 2017 Venice Biennale, following a competitive selection process open to applications across Ireland. Giblin’s initial proposal was selected by a panel consisting of Culture Ireland, Arts Council and Government representatives and international experts in the field of contemporary art. She was contracted by Culture Ireland to deliver all aspects of the Irish Pavilion. 

 For this prestigious international platform, Giblin, in collaboration with the artist Jesse Jones, proposed an exhibition about women’s rights that would project the issue of abortion in Ireland onto an international stage. The project was presented as an investigation into female oppression through history, with particular reference to the medieval witch trials in Europe. This research also led to Giblin’s editorship of an accompanying book, which brought together theorists, historians and practitioners \[3.2\]. 

 Giblin undertook her research following her appointment as Director of the Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh in November 2016. Her research sought to interrogate the contemporary resonance of historical witch trials. By innovating curatorial methods that could bring new visibility to such transhistorical connections, *Tremble Tremble* revealed the power of contemporary art to intensify longstanding and still topical issues. Giblin drew on staging techniques used in theatre to develop a method she has termed ‘exhibition dramaturgy’. This enabled the creation of performative, immersive and multi\-sensory spaces, and used performance to enhance the exhibition’s political content. Thus, *Tremble Tremble* brought emphasis to the subject of women’s rights as all\-encompassing, dynamic and multi\-faceted. 

 The exhibition was produced as a multimedia installation running on a 25\-minute loop. This involved performed interventions by gallery staff, and state\-of\-the\-art theatre programming technology \(QLabs\) that enabled more control over the staging than is possible with standard multi\-screen installations, to produce a sense of simultaneous unfolding of stories and enhance the experience of immersion. 

 Following the success of the Biennale exhibition, Giblin was invited by 3 major international institutions to tour *Tremble Tremble*: Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore \(ICAS\) at the LASALLE College of the Arts, Singapore; Project Arts Centre, Dublin and Museo Guggenheim, Bilbao. She also staged the exhibition at the Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh. She adapted each installation to its new local context, enabling the broadest possible reach to diverse publics. For instance, in Edinburgh, a Scold’s Bridle was included to reference Scotland’s distinct history of witch trials. The exhibition in Bilbao incorporated historical objects and documents related to witchcraft in the Basque Country on loan from the San Telmo museum in San Sebastian. 

  

 Commenting on Giblin’s curation of *Tremble Tremble*, Jones stated that ‘Tessa’s role as curatorial dramaturg brings new and exciting possibilities \[…\] through her deep knowledge of the role of spectatorship and craft with theatrical devices’, and praised her curatorial process as ‘truly collaborative, as artistic vision meets curatorial vision’ \[3.1\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 The five exhibition presentations of *Tremble Tremble* were major public events, drawing approximately 850,000 visitors in total \[5.1\]. 

 Giblin selected the topic of women’s rights for the representation of Ireland at the 2017 Venice Biennale a year before the Irish referendum on abortion.  The exhibition opened on 8 May 2017 and the referendum was held on 25 May 2018, leading to a decision to repeal the abortion ban, also known as the 8<sup>th</sup> amendment. 

 The impact of *Tremble Tremble* on public perceptions around abortion rights was quickly registered, as evidenced by speeches and statements by high\-profile individuals. The Director of the Glucksman Gallery of Contemporary art in Cork wrote: ‘it galvanised those of us who were involved and committed to repeal, by enabling us to envisage an Ireland that chose *Tremble Tremble* for its international representation at Venice, through the confidence of the presentation, the powerful artistic expression and erudition and elegance of the curating, as a way to feel confident about advocating for the change to come’ \[5.2\]. The curator at Guggenheim Bilbao noted that the exhibition had an ‘extraordinary impact on the \[local\] community’: ‘\[t\]he fact that present and immemorial past appeared so closely linked was felt clearly’ \[5.3\]. 

 On 21 May 2017, the Irish President Michael D. Higgins visited *Tremble Tremble*, days before his visit to Rome to see the Pope. This was the first time an Irish president had made a public visit to the Irish Pavilion at the Biennale and the media coverage further thrust the exhibition onto the international stage. RTÉ \( *Raidió Teilifís Éireann*\), Ireland’s national television broadcaster, reported on the visit \(viewed by 295,000\) and commissioned a documentary \(viewed by 64,000\) \[5.4\]. There was particular media interest in the visit, since Higgins had opposed the ban on abortion \(the 8th Amendment\) in 1983. The visit was documented in a YouTube video that drew 1,057 views \[5.5\]. Two weeks after the outcome of the vote, *Tremble Tremble* opened at Project Arts Centre in Dublin in a charged homecoming. Ailbhe Smyth, co\-leader of the YES Campaign to Repeal the 8th Amendment, spoke at the opening of how *Tremble Tremble* inspired voters: ‘you knew, in witch\-like fashion, you knew exactly what we needed to do, and to hear, and to see and to feel’ \[5.6\]. 

 While there is a history of politically engaged art in Ireland, this was the first time the Irish Pavilion at the Venice Biennale had explored contemporary political issues. High\-profile artworld figures commented on *Tremble Tremble’s* timely political content. The Head of Visual Arts at Creative Scotland noted how it encouraged reflection on national politics and their histories and affirmed how contemporary art can ‘motivate us to be more active in the social/civic sphere’ \[5.7\]. The Director of the Glucksman Gallery of Contemporary art in Cork commented that ‘there was a profound connect through the work and its curatorial contexts that enabled audiences a reflective and imaginative connection with women’s rights’, and she noted the importance of *Tremble Tremble* ‘within the specifics of the abortion referendum in Ireland and the wider MeToo movement’. They stated that the exhibition ‘reinforced my belief in the power of contemporary art to shape \[national\] discourse and connect people to issues in a radically thoughtful way’ \[5.2\]. The Director of Arts Council Ireland noted that the visual presentation ‘was both dramatic and visceral and forced the audience to engage with the work and the subject in a very immediate manner \[…\] *Tremble Tremble* was both a catalyst and influence on the repeal campaign’ \[5.8\]. 

 The positive response within social and print media brought *Tremble Tremble* extensive national and international visibility, impacting international perceptions of Ireland. The Director\-General of RTÉ, remarked in an article on RTÉ.IE/culture on *Tremble Tremble’s* ‘massive impact’, ‘very much of the now, given what’s going on here in Ireland’, demonstrating that ‘Ireland is a contender’ and central to important political debates \[5.9\]. *The* *Burlington Magazine* commented on *Tremble Tremble’s* ‘direct feminist message’. *CNN Style* described it as ‘a powerful statement about self\-determination’ \[5.9\] and for *The Scotsman* it was ‘amidst a growing wave of anger from secular Ireland \[..\] perfectly contemporary.’ *Elephant – The Art and Culture Magazine* remarked on the way *Tremble Tremble* emerged ‘from the rising social movement in Ireland that calls for a transformation of the historic relationship between Church and state’. Australia’s *Daily Review* commented on its ‘powerful statement’ about ‘the right to self\-determination’. For the Spanish regional daily paper *Diario de Noticias* \(89,000 readers daily\), *Tremble Tremble* ‘reflects a time of tense debate over the legalisation of abortion in Ireland’ \[5.9\]. Patricia Cronin, an internationally\-recognised US\-based artist, wrote: ‘the exhibition elevated the subject of women’s rights on the world’s stage’, and ‘because Ireland chose \[it\] to represent the country – it gave viewers the explicit impression of \[a\] state endorsed and supported exhibition including the content’ \[5.10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Gideon’s research with Chilean exiles who were political prisoners under the Pinochet regime has led to the production of a museum exhibition and documentary film, both focused on the craftwork produced in Chilean prison camps. The documentary, *Crafting Resistance*, was directed by Chilean documentary maker Carmen Luz Parot and has been deposited into the permanent collection of the Museo de la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos, the only museum dedicated to the victims of the Chilean dictatorship. Screened at the Victoria and Albert Museum, it threw new light on the museum’s South American collections, influenced ongoing curatorial practice at the museum, and helped to shape the thinking of the Director of the Refugee Council, which co\-organised the event. The documentary has also had a significant personal impact on its Chilean participants and their families, notably spawning an ongoing craftwork project that has been a focus for emotional conversations and strengthened bonds between these ex\-political prisoners and their children. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The project 'Crafting Resistance: the art of Chilean political prisoners' is underpinned by Gideon’s research considering the health and wellbeing of Chilean exiles in the UK. As part of her research, Gideon conducted 45 oral history interviews with Chilean exiles and key stakeholders, such as ex\-directors of the Refugee Council and the World University Service, focussing on their arrivals to the UK in the 1970s and subsequent coping strategies, adapting to life in the UK in the aftermath of exposure to severe abuse of human rights. It is thought that of the approximately 200,000 Chileans exiled during the military regime, approximately 3,000 exiles came to the UK, of which up to half remain in Britain. The Chilean exile community are a hard to reach and relatively under\-researched group but offer important insights into refugee experiences having lived as exiles for over four decades. 

 The work that became ‘Crafting Resistance’ followed on from Gideon’s previous research into the Chilean health system and the health seeking behaviour of Latin American migrants in London \(REFS3, 4, 5\), and was initiated through contact with a Chilean exile ex\-student, with whom Gideon organised an event at Birkbeck in 2013 called ‘Chilean women 40 years on’, coinciding with the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the military coup in Chile. This event gave Gideon a degree of legitimacy within the Chilean exile community and enabled her to conduct new research, interviewing a number of Chilean ex\-political prisoners about common health issues potentially connected to their shared experiences. 

 Several different aspects of the research are explored in Gideon’s subsequent publications. Her 2018 article, ‘Gendering activism, exile and wellbeing: Chilean exiles in the UK’ \(REF1\) predominantly focuses on the women who accompanied political exiles to the UK but did not consider themselves to be political activists. It shows how UK\-based campaigning around Chilean solidarity during the military dictatorship offered an important source of wellbeing for many of the women who otherwise felt isolated and uprooted in exile. Coping strategies in exile was also explored in her 2016 book chapter ‘'Mental health and forced migration: the case of Chilean exiles in the UK' \(REF2\). 

 During the course of these interviews, a number of participants referred to their experiences of life within Chilean prison camps. Prisoners in more ‘open’ camps were allowed to engage in different activities and organised themselves to produce a range of crafts, some of which was sold to raise funds for the families of political prisoners and some kept for personal use. Several respondents reflected on the importance of this craftwork for their wellbeing, both during incarceration when it gave prisoners space to be creative and work communally, and today as the craft items serve as a reminder of their history and how far their lives have changed. 

 These discussions culminated in an exhibition of the craftwork \(October to November 2017 at the University of Warwick and January to February 2018 at UEL\). Over 100 pieces of craft were displayed, making the exhibition the largest collection of this type of craftwork outside of the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Chile. For the Chilean exile community, it was a public display of all that had been achieved under extreme conditions, as well as a confirmation of their living testimonies of the human rights abuses during the dictatorship. It was also an opportunity for the exile community to tell their own story, something that has arguably been previously denied to them despite the establishment of the Museum of Memory. These events raised public awareness about the Chilean experience and highlighted issues about forced migration today. 

 To document the exhibition and capture the story of the craftwork, Gideon produced a short film, *Crafting Resistance: The Art of Chilean Political Prisoners*. It tells the story of the survivors of Pinochet’s dictatorship, who had been imprisoned by the regime and then later fled Chile. Gideon collaborated with renowned Chilean documentary maker, Carmen Luz Parot. The film was funded through a grant from the Birkbeck ISSF funds for public engagement.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The ‘Crafting Resistance’ exhibition, which Gideon co\-curated with an ex\-political prisoner, and accompanying film, created with Carmen Luz Parot, has had significant impact not only on the community of Chilean exiles in the UK and their families, but also \(through the film’s acquisition by the Museo de la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos\) on the Chilean diaspora worldwide. It has additionally impacted the thinking and practice of professionals at both the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Refugee Council, both major institutions which work with large and varied groups of stakeholders. 

 <ins> **Exhibition at Warwick and UEL</ins><ins>:**</ins> The ‘Crafting Resistance’ exhibition was launched at the University of Warwick in October 2017 and repeated alongside the premiere of the accompanying film at the University of East London on 26 January 2018. Panel discussions at both locations focused on both the experiences of those included in the film and the longer\-term lessons that the Chilean case offers for refugees and forced migrants today, particularly in relation to health and well\-being. Speakers included the then\-Director of the Refugee Council, a Professor of Psychology and Social Change at UEL and a Clinical Psychologist, who is himself a Chilean ex\-political prisoner. 

 The exhibition served a number of purposes. For the Chilean exile community, it was a public display of all that had been achieved despite working in extreme conditions in prison camps, while also being a confirmation of their living testimonies of the torture and human rights abuses of many Chileans during the dictatorship. The exhibition was an opportunity for the exile community to tell their own story, not only through the interviews that informed the exhibition but also more directly through Gideon’s collaboration with her co\-curator. Simultaneously, the events raised public awareness about the Chilean experience while also raising issues about forced migration today and reflecting on ‘lessons learnt’ from previous generations. 

 Approximately 50 people attended the panel discussions at each site, with attendees stressing that they had not previously been aware of this aspect of Chilean history; others commented on the powerful stories conveyed through the craftwork, creating new understanding. One attendee wrote, ‘This was a very moving event which I think empowers political prisoners as so much more than simply victims. The power of creativity to resist and challenge the horrific regime illustrates the strength of the human spirit’ \(1\). Visitors noted that the exhibition ‘empowers political prisoners as \[more than\] victims’; visitors frequently use the word ‘victims’ to describe how their assumptions about Chilean prisoners were challenged and changed \(1\). Moreover, one Chilean attendee reiterated that this was a story they were familiar with, and that the exhibition had affirmed that the prisoners ‘were not passive\!’ \(1\). Another Chilean visitor attested that this was a ‘hidden’ part of their history; the exhibition made them ‘aware of the hope \[that\] prisoners had’ \(1\). Even for those with more knowledge, such as one visitor involved in Chilean solidarity campaigns in the 1970s, ‘seeing the \[prisoners’\] artefacts is a powerful illustration of their \[resistance\]’. 

 <ins> **Museum of Memory and Human Rights</ins>:** In December 2017 Gideon was invited to Chile to attend an event around memory and exile at the Museo de la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos  and to speak about her Crafting Resistance project. During the visit Gideon was shown the collection of craftwork held in the Museum’s archive as well as objects on public display and talked in\-depth to Museum staff about her own work with the Chilean exile community. After her visit, the Museum Director requested a copy of the Crafting Resistance film for their collection. With the support of the Museum, *Crafting Resistance* was subsequently translated into Spanish and deposited as a permanent artefact in the archive of the museum. The film was publicly screened on 23 July 2019 \(2\), to an audience of 55 \(3\), and alongside other audiovisual materials in the collection, it is accessible to visitors in a dedicated audiovisual screening room. 

 The museum was opened in 2010 by President Michelle Bachelet, herself an ex\-political prisoner interned and tortured by the military regime. The museum is of unique significance in Chile, documenting the Pinochet dictatorship between 1973 and 1990 and provides an inestimably valuable resource for the former political prisoners and the Chilean international diaspora who fled Pinochet’s regime. This community is spread across the globe, with significant Chilean populations in Canada, the UK and Sweden amongst other countries. The inclusion of Gideon’s film as a permanent historical artefact in the museum’s archive places it at the centre of a global network of Chilean exiles and their descendants. It also situates Gideon’s research and the words and experiences of the participants in the documentary within the nationally recognised narrative of this period of the country’s history. This is particularly important in context: many of those ‘disappeared’ by Pinochet have still never been found and the fear of being silenced or forgotten is thus particularly acute amongst survivors of the regime. *Crafting Resistance* allows some of these survivors to speak for themselves and gives their testimony a place as part of the national record. 

 <ins> **Second\-generation refugees</ins><ins>:**</ins> The theme of the inter\-generational transmission of trauma ran through each of the two launch events, where self\-defined ‘second generation Chilean exiles’ spoke about their experiences of inheriting the craft objects and the responsibility this entails. 

 Other second\-generation exiles have expressed that watching *Crafting Resistance* together similarly enabled them to start new conversations within their families around the trauma that parents had endured. For example, a second\-generation exile whose parents participated in the ‘Crafting Resistance’ film and exhibition, and whose mother is one of the ten ex\-political prisoners who appear in the film, was inspired by this experience to develop her own project. She has continued the work of using craft as a means of political expression, founding ‘Bordando por la Memoria’ \(Embroidering Memory\), a community group which is focused on embroidering the names of approximately 3,000 men, women and children who were disappeared under the military regime. Bordando por la Memoria also organises sewing workshops and public talks about the history of the Chilean dictatorship, maintaining an active community on Facebook \(with approximately 1,400 members\) where participants share their work and discuss issues of relevance to the Chilean diaspora. 

 In addition to founding Bordando por la Memoria, she organised two embroidery workshops as part of the film launch at UEL. Forty people attended the workshops and took the opportunity to embroider their own ‘arpillera’ while also hearing the stories of some of the Chilean women who had similarly made these small tapestries during the dictatorship. The Bordando por la Memoria have subsequently organised a number of workshops around the UK including events in Belfast, Liverpool, London and Cambridge. Workshop participants include several first\- and second\-generation Chilean exiles who use their sewing as a means of commemorating friends and family members disappeared by the regime – often by embroidering images taken from photos of the person – but also by talking about that person as they sew. Participants are invited to tell their own family stories through their craftwork. 

 ‘Sewing to protest in a Chilean prison camp’ \( [https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3cszf07](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3cszf07)\), an episode of *Outlook,* aired on the BBC World Service at the beginning of September 2020. In the programme, \[redacted\] reflects on how Crafting Resistance opened up new spaces for her to engage with her parents’ experiences of both activism and torture and incarceration during the Chilean dictatorship as well as giving her a deeper understanding of what it meant for them to be forced into exile in the UK in the 1970s. 

 She discussed in the documentary how the impacts of ‘Crafting Resistance’ on families like her own have been both very personal and of much wider importance: 

 ‘it's been a very intimate journey. It is emotional. But I think it's important that \[my mother\] does share these stories with me, with my brother, with my sister; at some point, with her grandkids. Because it's not just a part of our family history. I think it's part of a collective experience.’ \(4\) 

 She also speaks to the ways in which the conversations facilitated by the craftwork, both as displayed in the original exhibition and film, and as practised in the workshops that she now runs herself, can help those impacted by experiences of imprisonment and exile to talk about their own history and to find both companionship and solace. 

 ‘I can't say that it will heal everything thoroughly but I think just getting together, maybe with other people that have lived through the same things, and making these things together and talking about them... and sharing that with a younger generation, I think that does have some healing capacity.’ \(4\) 

 <ins> **Impact on UK institutions</ins><ins>:**</ins> The V&A is the world’s ‘leading museum of art, design, and performance’, attracting over 4,000,000 visitors between 2018 and 2019. The annual Culture in Crisis programme is one of their flagship events \(5\). In June 2019, *Crafting Resistance* was exhibited at the V&A in collaboration with the Refugee Council and Counterpoint Arts as part of the V&A’s Culture in Crisis programme and to celebrate Refugee week. 117 people attended the screening, which was followed by a panel discussion with Gideon and the Director of the Refugee Council. The Bordando por la Memoria founder spoke about her project, discussed above, and several of the Chilean women who featured in the film spoke at greater length about their own craftwork. As well as ‘support\[ing\]… the Culture in Crisis programme’s strategic goal to raise awareness and advocacy for heritage protection’, the event addressed a historical imbalance in the museum’s collections. Museum curator and Cultural Heritage Preservation Lead describes it as ‘a very valuable piece of programming \[…\] because we don’t have a huge South American collection. The film that Jasmine has produced has specifically helped to rebalance this’ \(6\). 

 Evidently, Gideon‘s collaboration with the V&A has impacted on the representation and preservation of international refugee communities’ cultural heritage. In a context where refugee communities are marginalised, misrepresented and often vilified, hearing and amplifying their voices matters, doubly so with a diaspora as diffuse as the Chilean refugee community. This importance is reflected in the fact that the event was promoted by key refugee and heritage projects such as the Living Refugee Archive \(7\) and the Crafts Council \(8\). 

 *Crafting Resistance* also had an ongoing impact on the policy and practice of both the V&A and the Refugee Council. The Cultural Heritage Preservation Lead occupies a key strategic role within the V&A. *Crafting Resistance* helped her not only to ‘understand more about the experience of Chilean women of the 1970s’ but to reflect and apply this lesson more broadly, ‘to inform \[the museum’s\] own work for contemporary refugee or displaced communities’. Additionally, the event format helped to establish a model for future programming at the museum: she describes the screening and discussion programme as ‘advantageous’ when compared to their regular programming of talks given in isolation, serving ‘as a good test for how we do something like this in the future’ \(6\). 

 The Refugee Council is a national charity that in 2019 supported over 8,600 refugees \(8\). The V&A and Refugee Council have a well\-established relationship and collaborated in co\-organising the *Crafting Resistance* screening and discussions, in which the Director of the Refugee Council participated \(9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The cost of chronic wound management in the UK is more than £5.3 billion annually. Researchers from the University of Huddersfield \(UoH\) have developed the Tissue Viability Leading Change \(TVLC\) competency framework; the first to provide equity in education and skills development for multi\-professional teams managing chronic wounds. 

 TVLC formed the cornerstone of the National NHS Improvement Stop the Pressure Programme education curriculum and the NHS England National Wound Care Strategy \(NWCS\) education stream. It delivered improved continuing professional development and education for Tissue Viability Practitioners. It is central to competency training of healthcare professionals across the UK, supported by a business skills course for senior Tissue Viability Practitioners. Its implementation has changed clinical pathways for wound care and delivered parity of skills and service delivery to NHS Trusts, enabling benchmarking and standardisation between services. It has provided commercial benefit to an industrial partner. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Common chronic wounds, such as pressure ulcers, are associated with patient suffering, increased mortality and morbidity and prolonged hospital stay. More people are developing chronic wounds, so implementing a consistently high standard of wound care continues to be a national priority for the NHS Commissioning for Quality and Innovation \(CQUIN\) framework. In the UK alone, the annual cost of managing wounds that healed was £2.1 billion with an additional £3.2 billion for the 39% of wounds that did not heal. Accordingly, strategies that focus on \(a\) wound prevention, \(b\) accurate diagnosis and \(c\) improving wound‐healing rates will benefit patients and the NHS. 

 The research underpinning this case study took place within the Institute for Skin Integrity and Infection Prevention \(ISIaIP\) at UoH and was led by Professor **Ousey** \(Professor of Skin Integrity since 2005\). Other members of the team were **Atkin** \(Lecturer Practitioner since 2005\), **Blackburn** \(Research Fellow since 2017\), **Stephenson** \(Senior Lecturer in Biomedical Statistics since 2010\) and **King** \(Professor of Psychology since 1992\). 

 Tissue Viability Services \(TVS\) are nurse\-led and support multi\-disciplinary teams by providing specialist advice and care to clinicians and patients with, or at risk of, developing acute and chronic wounds.  The Tissue Viability Nurse \(TVN\) role supports healthcare across specialities including paediatrics, older people and mental health. Practitioners need specialist competencies to manage skin integrity and to implement evidence\-based findings into their practice. 

 In 2014 Ousey and Atkin’s research \[3.1\], in collaboration with the Chief Matron and the Clinical Lead for Tissue Viability at Northumbria Healthcare, established that the TVN role had no nationally accepted definition. The research included a literature review, semi\-structured interviews and questionnaires. The absence of a definition prevented the consistent measurement of the effectiveness of TVS and resulted in inconsistent expectations of the TVN role. The research concluded that without an assessment framework for TVS it would not be possible to benchmark services as part of quality improvement strategies. Benchmarking, or comparing NHS services with each other, is a way to improve the quality of patient services by reducing unnecessary variations in care. 

 In 2015, Urgo Medical, a distributor of wound healing products, funded Ousey to explore the impact of the lack of a framework by examining TVNs’ perceptions of their job roles and responsibilities using a mixed\-methods design study with an online survey \(n= 261, 63.7% employed as TVNs\) and seven semi\-structured interviews, undertaken at the Wounds UK Conference \[3.2\]. They asked delegates what they required to perform their role more effectively. Participants felt the TVN role was misunderstood because of an absence of any educational requirements or assessment criteria. Role responsibilities, person specification and grade varied across NHS Trusts, underlining the need for an assessment framework for TVS, aligning with Ousey’s previous research findings \[3.1\]. 

 In 2016, Ousey led a group of six TVS experts to create the first nationally recognised competency framework detailing the core competencies of TVNs: Tissue Viability Leading Change \(TVLC\). This was validated by independent experts from the Wound Care Alliance, the Journal of Wound Care and the Journal of Foot and Diabetes Wound Care and Wounds UK. 

 Further research led by Blackburn in 2018\-19 confirmed that the TVN role has continued to become more complex due to an aging population \[3.3\] and a rise in the incidence of chronic wounds \[3.4\]. This resulted in increased demands being placed on TVS and demonstrates the complexity of running a service that lacks a framework against which to plan the training and education of pre\-registration nurses \[3.5\] and support nurses in gaining the confidence and competence of appropriate wound care \[3.6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Tissue Viability Leading Change \(TVLC\) framework \[5.1\], developed by ISIaIP at the UoH, has improved NHS patient care by enabling the professionalisation of TVS and the practitioners who work within them. This has been achieved by informing and improving continuing professional development and education for TVNs; enabling parity of skills and service delivery across NHS organisations; enabling commercial impact for URGO Medical, a distributor of wound healing products. 

 <ins> **Informing and improving continuing professional development and education for TVN**</ins> 

 In 2015, the Nursing and Midwifery Council \(NMC\), the body that sets professional standards for UK nurses \(and midwives\), issued guidance that all registered practitioners must improve their practice in line with the best model available. TVLC provides this model for practitioners to develop and update their wound care competencies. Completion of TVLC training, in tandem with the NMC and Health Care Professionals Council Continuing Professional Development \(HCPC CPD\) reflection documents, allows for nurses and podiatrists to demonstrate they have met the requirements for their annual revalidation.  Preliminary analysis of the use of the framework in 2016 \[5.2\] showed downloads for the TVLC framework were 331 \(Ousey, Stephenson and Carter, 2016\), which represented 69% of the total number \(n=480\) of Tissue Viability Society members in 2018. Central Manchester, Pennine Care and Northumberland NHS Trusts have embedded the framework into their TVN training curriculum. 

 In 2016, following requests for higher\-level skills training from TVNs, a TVLC Business Skills Course was created through a collaboration between ISIaIP and URGO Medical \(accredited as a Masters module by UoH\). Course evaluations identified that completion of the course equipped TVNs with the skills needed to take a service\-based project to successful implementation, resulting in increased investment for TVS. 

 Student evaluations \(2017\-18\) demonstrate increased confidence and in\-depth understanding focused around business management acumen for their senior role, resulting in improved service delivery and patient care. Students said the course enhanced their professional and continuing development. “I was tasked to complete a business case to increase staffing required to reconfigure the service ..., there \[is\] no support in house to complete such a task. The business case was successful and the finances awarded ... submitting a business case to increase staffing is one of the most difficult ... and often such requests are declined. I am confident that the skills that I gained ... were integral to the success of the submission” \(student \[5.3\]\). Another student said: “The TVLC Business skills course ... supported me ... in my Tissue Viability role. ... I embarked on a large project to reduce variations in leg ulcer care across our Trust. I had ideas of what I wanted to do ... however at the beginning of the course I had difficulty articulating both verbally and written my vision and the benefits of the vision for the future in a clear manner. The course has developed me to think more business like ... \[the course\] has personally developed me immensely in carrying out this project leading to our launch of the Algorithm and Pathway last month” \(student \[5.4\]\). 

 TVLC has also provided a foundation for the development of a national, multi\-professional, multi\-level capability framework for wound care, the National Wound Care Strategy Programme \(NWCSP\), which was commissioned by NHS England. “Professor Ousey’s work in relation to the TVLC competency framework is providing a foundation for the development of a national, multi\-professional, multi\-level capability framework for wound care. Professor Ousey is a valued member of the steering group for this project” \(Director of NWCSP \[5.5\]\). 

 <ins> **Enabling parity of skills and service delivery**</ins> 

 TVLC was the first framework to be embedded into practice for assessing roles and responsibilities of TVN. It consists of 10 core competencies, which enable consistent identification of education and training gaps and provides clarification of job roles and responsibilities. It facilitates the benchmarking, or comparison with each other, of services and standardised measurement of their effectiveness, as part of quality improvement strategies. 

 TVLC codified best practice and was launched in 2016 at the national Wounds UK annual conference, attended by 4,000 health care professionals \(HCPs\).  Subsequently, the framework has been adopted across NHS Trusts in Greater Manchester, North East England, Yorkshire & Humber, Glasgow and London. The platform was developed by UOH and supported by URGO Medical UK. 

 In 2017 the NHS CQUIN \(Commissioning for Quality and Innovation\) framework announced new targets focussed on wound assessment. The launch of the TVLC framework in 2016 enabled Trusts to be prepared in advance to meet the standards of the new CQUIN, by ensuring that the skills and competencies of clinicians working within the field of wound care were in line with their clinical practice and that they could identify areas for development. 

 The NHS Improvement \(NHSi\) pressure ulcer core curriculum \(2016\) used the TVLC framework as its foundation.  A section of TVLC, focused on pressure ulcers, was developed by Ousey and has been implemented in practice through the Stop the Pressure Programme National Education Curriculum since 2018. As part of the NHSi, it guides education for nurses and HCPs on preventing pressure ulcers. “The competency framework has been incredibly useful. Knowing that the TVLC framework is well embedded in practice and has been evaluated in use gave us confidence to include this comprehensive framework within our workstream.” \(Senior Clinical Adviser, NHSi Stop the Pressure Programme \[5.6\]\). The programme is used by all healthcare trusts in the UK, as well as providers such as care homes. 

 TVLC has been used at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust \(MUNHSFT\) Community Services \(2016 – present\) to provide a structured, self\-learning environment to 98 district nursing staff, underpinning the creation of a new evidence\-based practice clinical pathway. The new pathway, which integrated TVLC into the Trust’s wound care strategy, aimed to reduce costs while also improving patient quality of life \(QoL\).  A key aspect of this was the incorporation of a wound care formulary that ensured the correct wound dressings were used consistently according to wound type. “Across MUNHSFT Community Services we adopted the TVLC competencies for leg ulcer management” \(Lead Nurse, Tissue Viability \[5.7\]\). 

 TVLC has also been used in Central Manchester NHS Trust to upskill and refresh district nursing competencies “The district nurses liked the competency tool as it gave them direction and goals to achieve.” \(Lead Nurse, Tissue Viability and Infection Prevention \[5.8\]\). 

 <ins> **Enabling commercial impact on URGO Medical UK**</ins> 

 URGO Medical is the medical division of the international URGO Group, developing wound care products.  The company has supported Professor Ousey’s research for the last decade. TVLC provides a consistent reference point for URGO sales staff to position discussions about customer requirements. The TVLC Business Skills course has driven sales because the graduates of the course have been successful in justifying greater expenditure on their service areas. “Working ... on the TVLC programme has to date enabled increased access and better engagement with 45 new key customers within Tissue Viability” \(Head of Market Access, URGO Medical \[5.9\]\). 

 Successful new customer acquisition has enabled URGO Medical to increase investment in their Healthcare Partnership Manager \(HPM\) role, expanding numbers from six to twelve in three years. TVLC and the TVLC Business Skills Course has encouraged a shift in mindset within URGO Medical to an outcomes\-based focus. This shift resulted in a project to develop and implement a new evidence\-based clinical pathway, with MUNHSFT. This project was recognised as an example of best practice by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in February 2020. “A key benefit ...has been that the TVLC business course is unique and innovative in providing business skills for clinicians at postgraduate level linked specifically to the speciality of Tissue Viability. \[Our\] work with Professor Ousey and the University ... has provided new opportunities and helped overcome some of the boundaries between industry and health care professionals.” \(UK Training Manager, URGO medical \[5.10\]\).  The company won the ‘2018 Partnership of the Year’ award from the Health Services Journal \(HSJ\) for their Clinical Pathway Support Service. 

 In 2017 TVLC itself was runner\-up in the annual Journal of Wound Care Awards. In 2018 it was shortlisted in the Education Innovation category of the HSJ awards. And in 2019 the TVLC Business Skills Masters module was shortlisted for both the HSJ awards for education and the Journal of Wound Care Awards \(placed third\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Dr **Irwin\-Rogers’** research on youth violence, particularly for the cross\-party Youth Violence Commission \(YVC\), has played a pivotal role in driving major changes to public, private and third sector policies and practices on youth violence. **Irwin\-Rogers’** work for the YVC led to the establishment of regional Violence Reduction Units in England and Wales and has been central in shaping the on\-going work of these units. In addition, acting on **Irwin\-Rogers’** recommendations, Google and the London Violence Reduction Unit have provided grants totalling GBP800,000 to fund *The Social Switch Project,* the primary aim of which is to reduce violence in young people’s lives. This innovative project has delivered safeguarding workshops to over 500 practitioners and provided work experience and skills training in the digital sector to over 40 young people. **Irwin\-Rogers’** research has also had a significant and direct influence on the funding priorities and work of the on\-going GBP200million Youth Endowment Fund. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since taking up his post with The Open University in January 2017, **Irwin\-Rogers** has conducted research into youth violence reduction primarily in England and Wales, focusing in particular on the potential benefits and feasibility of a public health approach. A key strand of **Irwin\-Rogers’** work has been his role as the lead academic for the cross\-party Youth Violence Commission \(YVC\), conducting research alongside economists from the University of Warwick’s Policy Lab. The YVC was established by a cross\-party group of MPs to identify and promote evidence\-based policies aimed at reversing the rising trend in knife crime and serious violence between young people. **Irwin\-Rogers’** research for the YVC has consisted of three main strands: 

1.  <ins>Interviews and Observations with the Scottish Violence Reduction Unit</ins> 

 The Scottish Violence Reduction Unit \(SVRU\) is widely acclaimed for its work in reducing levels of serious violence in major cities such as Glasgow. Between 2017\-18, **Irwin\-Rogers** conducted interviews and observations with senior members of the SVRU, including its Co\-Director and its Co\-Deputy Director. The research indicated that one of the key factors in reducing violence in Glasgow had been a move away from narrow, suppression and enforcement\-based strategies and their replacement with public health approaches, which involve identifying and adopting evidence\-based policies and practices across a wide range of social policy areas including health, education and youth services, driven and coordinated by teams of professionals such as the SVRU **\[O2, O3\]**. 

1.  <ins>National ‘Safer Lives’ Survey on Youth Violence</ins> 

 To address a lack of evidence on the levels of serious violence in young people’s lives, the YVC implemented a national youth survey in January 2018. Designed by **Irwin\-Rogers**, the *Safer Lives* survey gathered evidence on the nature and scope of violence affecting a diverse sample of over 2,000 young people in England and Scotland **\[O2, O3, O6\]**. The data revealed the high rate of violence in the lives of young people below the age of 16, and found that two thirds of respondents had been exposed to serious violence over social media, a finding that both confirmed the significance of social media that **Irwin\-Rogers** had highlighted in previous research **\[O4\]** and informed subsequent YVC recommendations and consequent policy and practice\-based initiatives such as *The* *Social Switch Project* **\[O2, O5\]**. 

1.  <ins>Expert Evidence Sessions</ins> 

 Between October 2017 and May 2018, **Irwin\-Rogers** played a central role in designing, organizing, and conducting six expert evidence sessions on the Parliamentary Estate. **Irwin\-Rogers** sat on panels taking evidence at four of the six sessions, each of which focused on a topic associated with the public health approach to violence reduction. Data was gathered from senior professionals and experts including the Head of the National Crime Agency, a Metropolitan Police Management Board representative, and the editor\-at\-large for The Guardian newspaper. Discussions from each evidence session were fully transcribed and analysed by **Irwin\-Rogers** and used to inform subsequent academic publications **\[O1, O5, O6\]**, as well as the YVC’s interim and final reports **\[O2, O3\]**. The evidence sessions further exposed the limitations of narrow policing\-based approaches to reducing youth violence and highlighted, for example, the importance of nurturing inclusive school environments under the broad scope of holistic public health approaches to violence reduction, overseen and coordinated by regional Violence Reduction Units. 

 <ins>Taking the research forward</ins> 

 **Irwin\-Rogers’** research for the YVC fed into an Open Grant application to the ESRC to build on and enhance some of the YVC’s research, engagement and impact activities. The application was successful, and **Irwin\-Rogers** is now part of a team of researchers \(led by Dr. Alistair Fraser, University of Glasgow\) who have secured GBP870,954.39 for a three\-year project on youth violence reduction which began in December 2020 **\[G1\]**. **Irwin\-Rogers** is leading on the London\-based component of this research, examining policy transfer between jurisdictions and informing the development of effective violence reduction strategies, policies and practices.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Irwin\-Rogers** has supported the Youth Violence Commission as lead academic, playing a central role in each component of its research, outputs, and impact and engagement activities **\[C1\]**. YVC research and reports have played a pivotal role in shaping public, private and third sector policy and practice through numerous channels. 

 <ins>Impact at a National Level</ins> 

 Through a series of meetings with key Government Ministers and other senior officials and debates and questions in the House of Commons, and the YVC has played a central role in shaping national Government policy on reducing violence between young people. 

 On 4<sup>th</sup> May 2018, **Irwin\-Rogers** met with the Prime Minister’s Special Advisor on Home Affairs and Justice at Number 10 Downing Street to discuss the YVC’s interim findings and recommendations **\[C2\]**. Among other things, **Irwin\-Rogers** made the case for tackling high rates of school exclusion and adopting a holistic public health approach to reducing youth violence, overseen and coordinated by regional Violence Reduction Units. In the House of Commons on 16<sup>th</sup> July 2018, the Home Secretary responded to a question from the Chair of the YVC, stating that he would make “ *a commitment to work with the all\-party Parliamentary group*” **\[C3\]**. Within three months, the Home Secretary announced ‘ *new measures’* to build on the Government’s Serious Violence Strategy, pledging his support for a public health approach to tackling youth violence **\[C4\]**. 

 Subsequently, the Chair of the YVC and **Irwin\-Rogers** met with senior government officials including the Minister for London and Policing \(18<sup>th</sup> March 2019\), the Prime Minister \(28<sup>th</sup> March 2019\), the Home Office Minister \(10<sup>th</sup> January 2019\), and the Minister for Schools \(10<sup>th</sup> July 2019\) to obtain high\-level commitment to implementing the YVC’s recommendations **\[C1\]**. In June 2019 the Home Secretary announced GBP35,000,000 funding for the establishment of 18 regional Violence Reduction Units **\[C5\]**. 

 MPs and Lords have formally recognised the work of the YVC and **Irwin\-Rogers’** research 72 times in the two Houses of Parliament **\[C6\]**. 

 <ins>Impact at a Regional Level</ins> 

 The YVC negotiated an exclusive campaign with the London Evening Standard to promote the recommendations of its interim report. Describing the publication as a ‘ *landmark report’*, the paper ran a front\-page article on 18<sup>th</sup> July 2018 aimed at persuading the London Mayor to adopt a holistic public health approach to reducing serious youth violence **\[C7\]**. In the same article, the Chair of the YVC called on the Mayor of London to create a London VRU to oversee the proposed public health approach. In response, the Mayor of London arranged a meeting with the Chair of the YVC on 30<sup>th</sup> August 2018 **\[C8a\]**, before releasing a press release on 19<sup>th</sup> September 2018 announcing his plans to develop and implement an “ *innovative public health approach to tackling violent crime*” **\[C8b\]**. In September 2020, in his 44<sup>th</sup> Report to the London Assembly, the Mayor of London welcomed the “ *many compelling recommendations”* of the YVC final report, and acknowledged that along with the then Home Secretary, he had endorsed and acted on the YVC’s recommended public health approach by establishing the London VRU **\[C9\]**. The YVC has worked closely with the London VRU since its inception and shaped its ongoing work and priorities. The Director of the London VRU said “ *the evidence of the report galvanised the policy agenda around the key wider issues from the role of schools to the importance of the health sector in playing its part. One of the key policies asked from the report was the establishment and long term support for violence reduction units across England and Wales; the Commission was a powerful advocate and used the parliamentary process to argue strongly and successfully*” **\[C10\]**. 

 <ins>Impact on private and third sector policies and practices</ins> 

 Following the publication of a research report on social media and serious violence **\[O4\]**, **Irwin\-Rogers** has participated in numerous private meetings with Facebook \(online\) and Google/YouTube \(London Headquarters\) during the period 2018\-2020 **\[C11\]**. During these meetings, **Irwin\-Rogers** advised on the development and refinement of the platforms’ monitoring and safeguarding policies. **Irwin\-Rogers** also recommended that Google/YouTube should take the lead in establishing social media safeguarding training for professionals working with young people. 

 In December 2018, based on these meetings and **Irwin\-Rogers’** research, Google announced a grant of GBP600,000 to fund the *Social Switch Project* **\[C11\]**. **Irwin\-Rogers** was invited to act as an Advisory Board member for the project and in this capacity has continued to inform its content and delivery **\[C11\]**. The project has three main strands: a series of social media training workshops for frontline professionals working with young people; a programme of work experience in the digital sector for disadvantaged young people; and direct funding to grassroots organisations working with young people. Interim evaluations have shown that the project has delivered highly\-rated social media safeguarding workshops to over 500 practitioners and provided digital skills training and work experience to over 40 young people **\[C12\]**. Among some of the most encouraging findings from an interim evaluation of the project, three young people have subsequently gained employment, two have secured apprenticeships, two have completed internships, seven have completed work experience placements, and another seven have set up their own social media platforms. As a consequence of its positive impact, the London Violence Reduction Unit has allocated an additional GBP200,000 to further support and extend the work of the *Social Switch Project* **\[C11\]**. 

 In October 2018, the then Home Secretary, announced the creation of a new ten\-year, GBP200,000,000 initiative known as the Youth Endowment Fund \(YEF\), the purpose of which is build up an evidence base for effective early interventions, and to fund programmes to steer young people away from crime and violence. The YVC has exerted a significant influence over the YEF’s work since its inception, with the YEF’s Executive Director acknowledging three specific forms of YVC influence and support: i\) the building up of a strong coalition of delivery organisations and politicians with whom the YEF will engage throughout its life cycle; ii\) the identification of key priority areas such as schooling, which will now receive GBP5\-GBP10million of YEF funding; and iii\) the development of a research and practice model that will “ *impact the spend of our entire GBP200m endowment*”. The YEF Executive Director acknowledged the wider impact of the YVC with “ *thanks and acknowledgement of the work that has been done, the direct impact it has on wider society, the youth violence sector, government and the lives of young people”* **\[C13\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Horizon 2020 RESIN project, building on a 20\-year programme of research at the University of Manchester, has improved planning and decision\-making for climate change adaptation and resilience across Greater Manchester and Europe. 

1.  Our research has advanced the development and implementation of the *Manchester Climate Change Framework 2020\-2025* and the *Climate Change and Low Emission Strategies: Whole Place Implementation Plan* *for Greater Manchester \(2016\-2020\)*, by giving adaptation and resilience strategy greater prominence on the policy agendas of Manchester Climate Change Agency and the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. 

1.  Our online spatial decision support portal, the European Climate Risk Typology, has provided a practical tool for policymakers, advancing their understanding of climate risk and shaping policy development. The portal has: supported the European Investment Bank in the development of its climate risk model; improved the European Environment Agency’s understanding and communication of climate risk; and informed the adaptation and resilience agenda advanced by the European Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Susceptibility to adverse impacts stemming from climate change varies significantly in form and extent between urban areas, depending on their location, socio\-economic circumstances, and biophysical characteristics \[1,2\]. University of Manchester \(UoM\) research has demonstrated the need to differentiate cities according to their vulnerability to extreme weather and climate change hazards \(e.g. floods and heat waves\), so that effective, city and region specific responses can be developed \[1,2\]. There is also a need for collaboration between cities and regions with similar climate risk profiles, to share experiences and learning \[2\]. These goals can be supported via the development of climate risk typologies \[1,2\]. 

 The Climate Resilient Cities and Infrastructures \(RESIN\) project brought together 17 partners from eight countries. Beginning in 2015, RESIN’s primary focus was to produce knowledge, tools and methodologies to support urban areas in becoming better adapted and more resilient to climate change. RESIN applied a risk\-based framework for understanding climate change impacts and developing adaptation responses to reduce those impacts \[3,4\]. Three key outputs from the UoM RESIN research are: 

 **Output 1\) The European Climate Risk Typology** \[4,5\]. Developed collaboratively by UoM with the input of RESIN project partners and end\-users, the Typology is an interactive online portal to visualise, compare and analyse climate risk across European cities and regions \(Figure 1\). The Typology helps users to understand and assess climate change risks in their area. It also helps them to identify other European cities and regions with comparable climate risk characteristics, in order to develop links and share experience. 

 **Output 2\) An online portal for new spatial datasets.** The data underpinning the Typology is freely available via an online portal \[5\]. These new spatial datasets, covering all of Europe, are organised around the four climate risk themes of hazard, exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity \[3\]. This data can support climate change adaptation and resilience strategy in cities and regions across Europe by enhancing the development of evidence bases to help decision\-makers identify their most pressing climate risks and thereby develop strategy accordingly. 

 **Output 3\) An extended evidence base for Greater Manchester.** Alongside the Typology and data portal, our research has generated new datasets that identify climate change risks to critical infrastructure, and flood risk to transport infrastructure, in Greater Manchester \[6\]. These datasets have informed and supported the development and implementation of climate change adaptation and resilience strategies in Greater Manchester.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research has positively impacted on urban climate change adaptation and resilience planning in Greater Manchester and at the European level by strengthening knowledge and providing practical tools used by policymakers to inform climate risk modelling and support the development and implementation of climate change strategies and frameworks. 

###  a\) Strengthening Greater Manchester climate adaptation and resilience strategies and frameworks 

 UoM researchers collaborated with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\) and the Manchester Climate Change Agency to co\-produce knowledge of local climate risks and support the development and implementation of climate change adaptation and resilience strategies and frameworks. The European Climate Risk Typology, launched in October 2018 \(Output 1, \[5\]\), and our extended evidence base for Greater Manchester \(Output 3, \[6\]\) were used to develop and implement local climate change adaptation and resilience strategies. 

 The *Climate Change and Low Emission Strategies: Whole Place Implementation Plan for Greater Manchester \(2016\-2020\)* \[A\] is Greater Manchester’s overarching climate change strategy \[B\]. As noted by GMCA’s Assistant Director of Environment, “ *Completion of the RESIN project itself represents the delivery of one of the first actions of the implementation plan. RESIN project outputs \(including the European Climate Risk Typology and reports on climate risks to critical infrastructure\) have acted as an overarching resource to inform and support the delivery of subsequent actions listed in the strategy. For example, a RESIN project report allowed us to identify the key risks to Greater Manchester’s transport infrastructure posed by increased incidence of flooding, as part of our transport strategy and planning*” \[B\]. Collaboration between GMCA and the UoM RESIN project has also helped to establish Greater Manchester as one of four pilot areas to develop new approaches to the protection and enhancement of the natural environment, as part of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 25\-year environment plan. RESIN research outputs have subsequently enabled Greater Manchester to advance its Urban Pioneer programme, which assesses new tools and methods for managing the natural environment \[B,C\]. 

 The *Manchester Climate Change Framework 2020\-2025* \[D\] was developed by the Manchester Climate Change Partnership. Comprising 60 members across ten sectors, the Partnership used RESIN research outputs to set Manchester’s adaptation and resilience priorities and objectives. Citing RESIN research on climate change risks to critical infrastructure, the Framework states \(p. 20\): “ *Floods and storms account for the highest risks, and these events stand out as priorities for adaptation and resilience planning and action*” \[D\]. The Framework also makes direct reference \(p. 21\) to the use of the RESIN European Climate Risk Typology to progress Manchester’s adaptation and resilience objectives and “ *… identify and then learn from cities and urban areas that have a similar climate risk profile as Manchester*” \[D\]. 

 Summarising the impact of the RESIN project on the development of climate change adaptation and resilience in Manchester, the Programme Director of the Manchester Climate Change Agency noted that “ *The RESIN project has made a valuable contribution to the evidence base on topics linked to climate change adaptation and resilience in Manchester and has developed tools to help drive forward progress. In doing so, the RESIN project has helped the City of Manchester to establish a formal policy commitment to address the challenges associated with the changing climate*” \[E\]. 

###  b\) Impact on European institutions working to strengthen urban climate change adaptation and resilience knowledge and planning 

 As a result of direct engagement with European agencies, the reach and impact of the RESIN project extends across Europe. Drawing on Google analytics data \(which understates the totality of traffic to the website\), the European Climate Risk Typology website \(http://european\-crt.org/index.html\) was accessed during 1663 sessions \(occasions where a user interacted with the website\) by users from 87 countries, between February 2019 and October 2020 \[F\]. \(Capture of Google data analytics on use of the typology website only began in February 2019, following its release in October 2018.\) The Typology and associated datasets \(Outputs 1 and 2, \[4,5\]\) have directly supported European institutions working to strengthen urban climate change adaptation, and to improve the information they provide to cities and regions. 

 The European Investment Bank \(EIB\) is the lending arm of the European Union, the largest multilateral financial institution in the world and one of the largest providers of climate finance \[G\]. EIB has developed a climate risk model to assess the climate risk of its counterparties. The model provides transparency regarding the EIB’s exposure to climate risk, and enables it to meet the disclosure requirements of the European Central Bank \[G\]. The RESIN European Climate Risk Typology data *“…provided valuable support to the development of the prototype of the EIB Climate Risk model” by delivering an “assessment of the physical risks arising from climate change at the level of European regions*” \[G\]. EIB benefited from the Typology data which is “… *provided in a consistent, well\-structured and easily accessible way. Without the European Climate Risk Typology data, more time would have been needed to access and aggregate data on physical climate risk at the level of European regions*” \[G\]. 

 The European Environment Agency \(EEA\) is an agency of the European Union, whose task is to provide 32 member countries and six cooperating countries with robust information on the environment. The EEA used the Typology to inform their European Climate Adaptation Platform, Climate\-ADAPT, an online resource which helps users to access and share data and information \[H\]. Climate\-ADAPT incorporates an ‘Urban Adaptation Map Viewer’ which collates information to provide data on climate risk, using data from the UoM Resin Typology \[H\]. “ *The Typology has helped us to highlight the complex nature of climate risk at the European scale, and also to emphasise the importance of the exchange of experiences and learning between cities that share similar climate risk profiles*” \[H,I\]. EEA has drawn on the Typology to inform their recent report, *Urban adaptation in Europe: how cities and towns respond to climate change* \[I\]. This report notes that the Typology “… *emphasises that all of Europe’s cities and NUTS 3 regions* \[areas of 150000\-800000 inhabitants\] *are at risk from climate change, albeit for different reasons*” \[I\]. The EEA has undertaken additional work, drawing on the Typology, to classify cities according to their size, climate change vulnerability and risk characteristics \[H\], concluding that “ *The Typology is a useful strategic decision\-aid that supports more efficient and effective approaches to assessing and adapting to climate risks in European cities and regions*” \[H\]. 

 The Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy brings together over 10,000 local and regional authorities across 59 countries voluntarily committed to implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. Climate change risk and vulnerability assessments \(RVAs\) are required from all Covenant of Mayors signatories, and “… *the Covenant of Mayors recommends the use of the European Climate Risk Typology to signatories in order to support their climate change adaptation work*” and to develop their RVA \[J\].  As the Typology helps users to identify other regions with similar risk profiles, “ *this can help Covenant of Mayors signatories and their coordinators to find cities and regions that share their underlying climate risk characteristics, and to obtain and share knowledge with them and possibly develop exchange networks*” \[J\]. 

 The data underpinning the European Climate Risk Typology is of real value in light of the difficulties in accessing locally relevant climate risk data to inform climate change adaptation and resilience planning. Users can access a wide range of indicators in this database, covering different elements of climate risk, including new data produced within the RESIN project and data that was previously difficult for potential end users to access \(Output 2 \[5\]\). The Covenant of Mayors acknowledges this: “ *As data on climate change hazards, vulnerabilities and risks are not always readily available to European cities and regions*”, the Covenant of Mayors recommends the Typology as “ *a useful resource for aiding Covenant of Mayors signatories in meeting their commitments*” \[J\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The ease with which electronic data are reproduced, modified, and shared is bringing vast opportunities accompanied by the major societal challenge of assuring data integrity. Data provenance, the record of the history of information products, can be used to engender trust in data and to facilitate its reproducibility. Yet, its widespread implementation has until recently been elusive, due in part to a lack of common representation and formal model. Newcastle University research has underpinned the design of an extensible community\-based standard data model and formal ontology, denoted “PROV”, that has been adopted across geographies, sectors, disciplines and types of organisation. 

 PROV has become the most pervasive standard worldwide for seamlessly sharing data provenance within and across organisations, promoting positive changes in their working practices for data governance. This case study highlights its impact at NASA \(USA\), at the National Archives and the Gazette \(UK\), and at Astra Zeneca \(global\). It also mentions its role at NHS Digital, the Allotrope Foundation, and other organisations. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The W3C Working Group \(WG\) on provenance was formed in 2011 following an earlier community effort, the Open Provenance Model \(OPM\). Missier was an active contributor to the OPM, and between 2011 and 2013 his research has enabled the development of a data model for provenance that met the challenges of an interoperable standard. Newcastle’s contribution is twofold. Missier’s research between 2011 and 2013 provided a solid foundation for the design and later adoption of a formal data model and ontology, and was instrumental to shaping PROV into a viable model that could be accepted, adopted, and extended by multiple communities. Then, after PROV was released, Missier’s further research demonstrated how a number of technical hurdles, including comparing two provenance documents \[P5, P6\] and safely providing abstractions over PROV in order to protect sensitive provenance information \[P7\], could be overcome to implement PROV into practical systems. 

 The design process itself was 2 years long and complex, requiring leadership and coordination across about 40 diverse organisations. Working along the Working Group Chairs, Missier took a leadership role in shaping the model, as evidenced by the key normative PROV documents where Missier is one of the key editors. These documents are: 

 \[PROV\-DM\] The PROV Data Model:  [http://www.w3.org/TR/prov\-dm/](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/) 

 \[PROV\-N\] The Provenance Notation:  [http://www.w3.org/TR/prov\-n/](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-n/) 

 \[PROV\-CONSTRAINTS\] Constraints of the PROV Data Model:  [http://www.w3.org/TR/prov\-constraints/](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-constraints/), in addition to non\-normative documents where Missier has been the principal designer \(PROV\-DICTIONARY:  [https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE\-prov\-dictionary\-20130430/](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-dictionary-20130430/)\) and dissemination notes \(PROV\-PRiMER:  [https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE\-prov\-primer\-20130430/](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-primer-20130430/)\). 

 These formal PROV documents incorporate design elements that are grounded in Missier’s work. 

-  PROV is represented using both relational modelling and semantic modelling principles. Using the latter to express provenance was first proposed in \[P1\], which can therefore be considered a precursor to PROV\-O, the Ontology Web Language \(OWL\) specification of PROV \[ [http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC\-prov\-o\-20130430/](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/)\]. 

-  A PROV plan is a generic modelling element that can be used to describe how a piece of data is produced. A PROV modelling pattern prescribes how this can be specialised to represent concrete processes, such as scientific workflows. Missier contributed first by clarifying formally how provenance should be structured to accommodate workflow plans with certain desirable characteristics \[P2\], and later by co\-authoring an extension to PROV, called D\-PROV \(later “ProvONE”\) \[P3\], that lets scientists describe the process structure itself, as part of the history of the data produced by the process. Developed independently of the PROV WG and within the scope of the DataONE project \( [https://www.dataone.org/](https://www.dataone.org/) \-\- a large US\-based repository of Climate and Ecology datasets where Missier has been co\-chair of the Provenance Working Group since 2010\), this extension contributed to PROV’s adoption within scientific communities including DataONE, where PROV\-supported provenance is now actively promoted. 

-  In \[P3\], Missier also demonstrated that provenance could be expressed using Prolog, with advantages in terms of query capabilities over other implementation models. This representation has been used for instance in the ReComp research prototype \( [https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/recomp/](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/recomp/), EPSRC funding\). The PROV\-N document which he co\-edited \( [https://www.w3.org/TR/prov\-n/](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-n/)\) embraces this approach by providing a Prolog\-like syntax and model that is both human\-readable and machine\-processable. 

 In the post\-release phase of PROV’s life, Missier continued to produce research results that helped establish PROV’s role as an important community data model, encouraging adoption. Firstly, a provenance data model is only useful if it supports a provenance database that can be queried effectively. Missier and his colleagues at UC Davis, USA, showed how this can be accomplished in practice \[P4\]. Secondly, Missier and Watson showed how two provenance traces obtained from the execution of two independent processes could be compared with each other \[P5 and, more recently, P6\]. This is a key requirement to enable the reproducibility of data produced using scientific workflows. Finally, Missier and colleagues proved a suite of formal properties of PROV models, showing that it is possible to abstract out elements of a provenance document without compromising its integrity. This is a key property when provenance is to be exchanged between organisations with limited mutual trust \[P7\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Newcastle University’s research has contributed to the unique extensible design and widespread adoption of the PROV standard for data provenance. The model was endorsed by the World Wide Web Consortium \(W3C\) in 2013, and since then it has become the de facto standard for capturing and exchanging provenance. Data\-intensive organisations have also adopted PROV for internal use to add value to their datasets. 

 PROV has gained extensive reach geographically \(UK, EU, USA, Australia\), across disciplines \(Geoscience, Climate studies, Medicine, public information services\) and sectors \(Government, Business, Science\). Links to web\-published information by beneficiaries of PROV are collated in \[E1, E5\]. The investment required to incorporate PROV into existing data stores, creating extensions, and changing working practices is indicative of its value to beneficiaries. 

 The use cases below illustrate the level of impact of PROV on three high profile organisations: **NASA/ USGCRP \(US Global Change Research Program**\), global Pharma company **Astra Zeneca**, and the **National Archives** in the UK. An introduction to how they use PROV and why, is provided in \[E1\]. Below we highlight key points. In the words of their programme managers, the benefit has been in *making their information more authoritative and trustworthy in the eyes of their users*, and to engender positive changes of internal working practices concerning data governance. 

1.  **NASA / USGCRP** 

 NASA JPL manage the US Global Change Information System \(GCIS\)   [https://data.globalchange.gov/](https://data.globalchange.gov/), on which the National Climate Assessment \(NCA\) reports in the USA are based. These publicly available reports, commissioned by the USGCRP \(Global Change Research Program\), inform and influence policy debate on climate change and the environment, within the USA and internationally.  Impacts include: 

 **Change in working practice & policy.** The use of provenance in the GCIS was recommended by the Federal Advisory Committee on climate assessment and mandated by the US Administration \(President Obama at the time\) \[E3 Appendix 3\]. PROV, along with the GCIS ontology and other metadata vocabularies, is used systematically in the GCIS to *enforce the* *traceability of all of the about 50,000 individual resources held in the database* \[E3 section 5\].  According to Dr. Sherman of USGCRP \[E6\], *all contributors to the GCIS* are now required to curate their contributed content, including any climate science data. PROV metadata *must* now be supplied alongside any resource contributed. 

 Since 2012 NASA first, and now USGCRP, have demonstrated long\-term commitment to PROV and to data curation more broadly, by providing sustained funding for 3 FTE staff \[E6\]. 

 **Effect on policy debate provided by transparency and assurance** of the data held by the GCIS. PROV and the GCIS ontology have effectively promoted a culture of data curation and data trust within the climate science community. This percolates down to the reports themselves, which are public, and where PROV elements are exposed both for human reading and in machine\-processable formats \(XML, RDF\), providing trust into climate science as part of public discourse. According to Curt Tilmes, Data Scientist at NASA detailed to GCRP at the time, this was a significant benefit of PROV and enabled them to have “ *incontrovertible consensus*” to support climate debate \[E1 page 13\]. 

 **NASA has extended the PROV model** \[E2\] for use in the Planetary Data System \(PDS4\) which contains scientific data from the solar system planetary missions. The data, which includes historical datasets from the Voyager and Cassini missions is now continually updated and verified through the PROV extension. This enables valuable analysis: for example, the provenance schema for the Voyager ISS geometric calibrated images allows tracing information to be used by exoplanet scientists for analysis \[E1 pg. 13\]. 

 **PROV has benefitted satellite construction.** Satellites are made up of a large number of constituent parts procured via a long chain of intermediary suppliers. Counterfeit parts pose a particular problem for NASA. Dr Tilmes states that PROV data provides the audit trail that allows identification of the source of counterfeit or faulty parts \[E1 pg. 7\]. 

1.  **UK National Archives and the Gazette** 

 The National Archives in the UK \(NA\) maintains 11 million historical government and public records in addition to current documents. Their data underpin the UK Government Gazette and legislation database. To assure data after digitisation, the NA have mandated the systematic inclusion of provenance \[E7\] as part of all the documents published by the Gazette. Recorded web traffic to the UK Government Web Archive suggest over 1.7 billion redirected hits to the website \(NA website\). 

 **Change of working practice** as a result of the requirement by the National Archives \(NA\) to include provenance. All of Gazette data must now be supported by provenance statements. PROV has made this possible and cost\-effective, as all the hard design work has already been done. The Gazette has committed dedicated staff to maintain and support provenance curation \(Dr. Cresswell interview \[E7\]\). 

 **Maintenance of authority & correctness of data** after digitisation. The Gazette is the authoritative source for public documents in the UK, as notices published by them are afforded legal standing \- traceability and trust in the information are therefore paramount. Originally only available as physical verified documents, the data has maintained integrity through the use of PROV during the digitisation effort. Data retrieved from the Gazette must be traceable: It is “ *the official public record, it has credibility, it has that kind of grand strength \[…\] now there is a provenance trail for every single notice \[…\] it will tell you what happened to the notice since it came to us for publishing, and every step that happens within that notice journey*.” Janine Eves, Business and Operations Director, The Gazette \[E4\]. 

 **Traceability of legislation data.** Legislation.co.uk, underpinned by the National Archives, is the official web\-accessible database of the statute law of the United Kingdom. PROV provides traceability to legislation data. This has been especially useful to maintain the trace of legislation originating from EU law to support exit arrangements \(Dr. Cresswell interview \[E7\]\). 

1.  **AstraZeneca** 

 AstraZeneca is a global pharmaceutical company with a portfolio of speciality care and primary care medicines. According to Dr Tom Plasterer, Director of Bioinformatics, Data Science & AI \[E8\], a provenance model was needed to support internal processes and PROV provided a community\-accepted solution for that. The process of adopting PROV along with other ontologies started in 2013 as part of a million\-dollar project, where PROV is estimated to account for about 5\-10%, with continued maintenance to date. This effort resulted in a **change of working practices,** where the use of shared vocabularies now informs data governance and promotes transparency: “ *its vital importance covers … processes from drug discovery, target identification, target validation, through to trial design, evaluation, clinical trials, and how data is managed*” \[E1\]. PROV has also enabled a new internal business intelligence system called CI360 to be developed, which bring **competitive advantage** to the company. It alerts scientists of possibly actionable news about competitors’ products. The technology is based on the popular concept of “nanopublications” \(http://nanopub.org/\), where scientific statements are systematically annotated with provenance assertions. *PROV ensures that the statements are properly corroborated and thus safely actionable*. 

 **Selected further cases of PROV in use.** 

 Other notable cases of PROV adoption, are documented in \[E5\]. Amongst these: 

-  <ins>The Allotrope Foundation</ins>, an international consortium of pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, and other scientific research\-intensive industries, develops and adopts specifications to standardize the acquisition, exchange, storage and access of analytical data captured in laboratory workflows. PROV is part of this suite. 

-  PROV has been adopted by <ins>Health Level Seven International \(HL7\)</ins> Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources \(FHIR\), part of NHS Digital UK. Beneficiaries are clinicians, researchers, and regulators who are better able to trace, reproduce, and analyse scientific data. 

-  <ins>CSIRO</ins>, Australia’s largest government research organisation, has extended PROV for earth sciences data. 

-  <ins>The Netherlands</ins> <ins>Government‘</ins><ins>s</ins> database of national registration of land and buildings incorporate PROV extension, “BAG”. Ministries, water boards, police forces and security regions, are obliged to use the data from the registrations.

 **1. Summary of the impact.** 

 Unelected lobby groups are important for government decision\-making and policy formation, but they face two challenges: first, many politicians are sceptical and even hostile about their legitimacy; second, they find it difficult to communicate their concerns effectively in a context of political change. Parvin’s research on the theory and practice of lobbying addresses these two challenges and has had two connected impacts: \(1\) It has increased understanding of lobbying  / public affairs among UK parliamentarians and government, helping to shape the policy / regulatory environment in which lobbyists work, and \(2\) It has improved the professional practice of a wide range of lobby groups in the UK and Australia, through organisational and policy change. The research has benefitted around 200,000 individual end\-users, including employees and members of companies and political organisations across the public, private, and charity sectors. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research.** 

 The impacts described in this case study were generated by an ongoing research programme carried out in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Loughborough University by Dr Phil Parvin. Dr Parvin, a political theorist with expertise in political lobbying and democracy, has over 15 years’ experience of working with lobbyists, campaigners, and parliamentarians. The research is driven by two questions: \(1\) What role do unelected lobby groups play in liberal democratic states and what role, if any, *should* they play? \(2\) How might lobby organisations more effectively communicate their concerns in a context of wider democratic change? 

 \(1\) Unelected lobby groups play an important role in liberal democratic states including the UK **\[R1**\]. This is both a good and a bad thing. On the one hand, they provide much\-needed expertise to generalist politicians, increase the representation of marginalised groups, and represent a bridge between citizens and institutions. On the other, they exist outside of formal democratic checks and balances, they are unelected and hence suffer a legitimacy deficit, and – empirical data suggests – disproportionately concentrate power in the hands of wealthy individuals and organisations. Parvin’s research analyses these tensions, and establishes the role that lobby groups have, and *should* have, in democratic societies. 

 \(2\) Parvin’s research also analyses how wider patterns of social and political change have affected the *role* of lobbyists and their *practice*. In particular, he researches how changing patterns of citizen participation have increased the centrality of lobby groups and changed their internal structure: as many citizens have become less politically active, many organisations have come to rely less on activist members to bring about political change, reorganising themselves as professionalised, hierarchical ‘interest groups’ which operate at the elite level **\[R2\]**. Parvin analyses the impact of economic inequality on the representation of marginalised groups by lobbying organisations and citizen participation **\[R3\]**, and researches the implications of unequal representation and political activity for democratic equality, inclusion, and decision making. He does so through critical engagement with contemporary research on democratic deliberation **\[R4\]**, as well as dominant approaches in political science to citizen participation, engagement, civic membership, and democratic expertise **\[R5\]**. 

 Parvin’s research is thus both normative and explanatory, as well as being grounded in the lived experience of lobbyists themselves: his theorising about the role of unelected lobby groups in democratic states is fundamentally shaped by empirical data and the practice of lobbyists themselves. The research employs a ‘normative ethnographic’ method: an exciting new approach in political theory in which normative conclusions are shaped by a deep grasp of empirical data produced by social and political scientists, but also the lived experience of political actors. This enables impacts to flow in both directions: normative arguments in the field of democratic theory are shaped by empirical reality and the day\-to\-day experiences of end\-users which means they can, in turn, speak to and help shape the practice of these end\-users. The research is thus enriched by dissemination in peer\-reviewed academic journals \(as indicated in the underpinning research section below\) and also outlets aimed at a wider audience of policy\-makers, think tanks, and lobbyists across numerous sectors.

","
 **4. Details of the impact.** 

 Dr Parvin was for five years \(2001 – 2007\) a professional public affairs practitioner, and then a Director at the Hansard Society. His research has shaped the regulatory and policy framework in which lobbyists operate for over a decade. His 2008 report *Friend or Foe: Lobbying in British Democracy* \(Hansard Society\) provided the definition of lobbying used by the Public Administration Select Committee in its inquiry into the issue, was quoted by David Cameron in his pre\-election campaign, and was instrumental in the shaping of the 2014 Transparency of Lobbying, Non\-Party Campaigning, and Trade Union Administration Act. Since 2001, Parvin has established his reputation among public affairs professionals, and an extensive network of contacts and external partners. Together these have afforded him access to key figures in UK public affairs and politics, and enabled him to develop strong **pathways** to use his research to help policy makers and public affairs professionals. The research undertaken in the current REF period has had two principal impacts. 

 **Impact 1: Shaped the policy and regulatory environment in which lobbyists work, and increased understanding of the industry among government** 

 Dr Parvin’s research has been instrumental in improving understanding of the UK’s £1.4 billion public affairs industry among government, leading to improved regulatory standards, and greater transparency across the entire public affairs industry. It has played a significant role in establishing regulatory codes of conduct and ethical guidelines used by over 2000 professional public affairs consultants and in\-house lobbyists. 

 As Gill Morris, Chair of the **Association for Professional Political Consultants** until 2018, reported, Parvin’s research **\[R1, R5\]** helped to “ *raise the status of the industry in the eyes of politicians, and also helped shape the regulatory framework in which the industry now works”*. The APPC was for 25 years the ‘principal representative body for lobbyists and the guardian for professional ethics’ with over 90 member organisations employing over 2000 individuals. Its central role was to ensure that lobby groups of all kinds were able to effectively campaign for political change transparently, within a clear and identifiable regulatory framework. The APPC’s work in this area endures in contemporary codes of conduct and regulation. Morris described the ‘ *considerable impact that Dr Parvin’s research into lobbying has had on the public affairs industry’* and on the regulation of lobbying. In particular, Parvin’s work on possible regulatory reforms, and the positive role of lobbying groups in societies characterised by wider democratic change, ‘ *has played a direct and important part in building advocacy for what we do*.’ His research 

 *‘supported and strengthened advocacy amongst member organisations. Doing so directly benefitted our 2000 member company: it helped me put the case for better regulation and to make the positive case to support UK lobbying and its value. As a result, codes of conduct are in place across the sector, there is more transparency and there is a better awareness among government, parliamentarians, and the wider policy making community about the role that lobbying plays in the UK, and its place in our democracy.’* **\[S1\]** 

 Parvin’s impact on policy debates is further corroborated by a senior member of the House of Lords. Lord McNally, Liberal Democrat peer and former lobbyist, describes how Parvin’s work has been: 

 *‘pivotal to the discussion within the public affairs industry among its practitioners, and beyond it among policy makers and other political actors. Public affairs professionals continue to find it useful in their own work, and in particular in their discussions about governance, regulation, and codes of conduct within the industry. Policy makers like myself have found it helpful as a source of clear and penetrating analysis on the ways in which lobbying fits in a democracy, and how we can ensure that it is practised ethically, transparently, and effectively in a changing political landscape’* **\[S7\]** 

 Finally, Marc Stears, Director of the Sydney Policy Lab, former Chief Executive of the New Economics Foundation \(NEF, one of the UK’s largest and most influential policy think tanks\), and former chief speechwriter for the Labour Party described Dr Parvin’s work as having ‘ *a significant impact on . . . debates within the policy making communities of the UK and Australia’,* as well as on his own work and professional practice, outlined in more detail below **\[S2**\]. 

 **Impact 2: Changed the way that think tanks, corporations, campaign organisations, and trade unions communicate with government, external partners, and their own members** 

 In addition to impacting UK policy debates, Parvin’s research has ‘ *influenced the role and conduct of public affairs professionals in the UK*’ \[Morris, **S1**\], transforming the professional practice of numerous individuals and organisations, from think tanks to some of the world’s largest global corporations. Through building close working relations with key individuals in a wide range of organisations, Parvin’s research has led to organisational change, and the development of new practices. 

  

 \(a\) For the New Economics Foundation think tank, Marc Stears, \(introduced above\) claimed that Parvin’s research **\[R2, R3, R4\]** shaped his practice, leading him to make fundamental changes to **NEF** and also the **Sydney Policy Lab** \(which he now leads\) <ins>realigning the way they communicate</ins> with other policy actors and their external partners. The research: 

 *‘had a demonstrable and wide\-ranging impact on how I do my job, and the activities and structures of the New Economics Foundation and the Sydney Policy Lab under my leadership . . . It has helped me to shape the research and campaigning activities of \[these organisations\] . . . As CEO of NEF and Director of the SPL . . . I re\-oriented our research programmes in ways which better tackle the reality that Dr Parvin describes.’* \[ **S2\]** 

 In particular, Parvin’s research 

 ‘*helped NEF to ground its ‘wellbeing economy’ campaign in a firmer grasp of the relationship between lobby/advocacy groups and patterns of participation. It also helped SPL to better pursue its core concerns of power, equality, and belonging . . . As CEO of NEF at a pivotal time in its development, and current Director of the SPL, I can say without a doubt that the impact of Dr Parvin’s research on these organisations’ research and advocacy work has been significant and far\-reaching.’* **\[S2\]** 

 Parvin’s research 

 ‘*improved my understanding of the challenges facing democratic states, changed my attitude to these challenges, and what solutions might be viable, changed my professional practice, by helping me to incorporate these ideas into research and advocacy \[at NEF and SPL\], . . . \[and, in doing so\] benefitted both NEF and SPL.*’ **\[S2\].** 

 \(b\) At **McKinsey & Company**, Steve John, Partner & Director of Global Communications reported that Parvin’s research into the changing role of citizens and organisations in UK democracy **\[R1, R2\]** as influential in his approach to his own role at the firm, changing the professional practice of a senior executive of one the largest consultancy firm in the world, employing over 30,000 people in 130 cities across the world. John’s role was, until 2019, to lead an international 350\-member team to ‘work with partners to protect and build the firm’s reputation globally’. John stated that through working closely with Parvin over a series of one\-to\-one and small group events, he learned how McKinsey could work more effectively with external partners and other policy actors. Dr Parvin’s research ‘helped \[him\] further understand the wider context in which businesses and other non\-state actors lobby for change’ in ways that shaped his own practice. 

 ‘*His insights into the ways in which changes in the political landscape can \- and should \- shape effective lobbying campaigns, have shaped my thinking, and I have drawn on his research in my own work . . . These insights have enabled me <ins>to</ins> <ins></ins><ins>connect</ins> <ins></ins><ins>with</ins> <ins></ins><ins>external</ins> <ins></ins><ins>partners</ins> by better understanding the challenges they face and what they need to succeed’.* **\[S4\]** 

 \(c\) Dr Parvin’s research has also impacted the practice of **trade bodies**, an influential class of organisation charged with representing industry and business interests in the political system. One example is the **Publishers’ Association**, the principal trade body for the £6 billion British book and journal publishing industry, with over 170 member companies. Dr Parvin worked closely with Chief Executive Richard Mollet, discussing his research findings with him **\[R2, R5\],** and showing him how the organisation might work more effectively with other groups to ensure that the interests of book publishers and authors are heard at the highest levels of government. Mollet describes Parvin’s research as ‘extremely influential’, providing vital background context to the wider lobbying efforts of his organisation. He suggests that Dr Parvin’s research was 

 *‘vital to \[his\] work as an advocate for the publishing industry at a time when it was coming under multiple pressures from online piracy, copyright reform and, in the case of academic publishing, emerging business models.*’ \[S5\]. 

 Mollet suggests that Parvin’s research 

 *‘confirmed the importance of alliance\-building and collaboration with partner organisations as a means of effectively seeking political change* . . . *His work prompted me to make important changes to our campaigns, and in the way we engaged with government, for example by <ins>introducing more social media and other online tools into our campaigning</ins><ins>’</ins>.* **\[S5\]** 

 \(d\) Finally, Parvin’s research **\[R4, R5\]** has been influential in the **trade union** sector, initiating demonstrable change in the practice of how unions communicate with their members, and with like\-minded organisations, in the interests of bringing about policy change. For example, Martin McIvor, Research Officer at the major trade union **Prospect** describes the significant changes that Dr Parvin’s work prompted in his organisation’s professional practice, transforming the way it communicates with its 140,000 members and seeks political change on their behalf. In a series of one\-to\-one meetings, Parvin and McIvor discussed the research in ways which enabled McIvor to implement changes in his own professional practice and implement positive changes in his organisation, including the 

 *‘introduction of <ins>new ways to facilitate collaboration</ins> with our members, to inform them of our activities on their behalf, and find out their views. For example, I have been involved in improving Prospect’s use of digital innovations such as platforms enabling members to easily contact their MP, and provide evidence and examples to support our national lobbying efforts, without creating undue or unrealistic demands on their time or familiarity with political processes.’* **\[S6\]** 

 It has also helped 

 *‘to improve and streamline our lobbying of government and other decision makers. For example, <ins>using social media to highlight and leverage commonalities of interest</ins> between Prospect and other civil society organisations engaged in lobbying government, such as environmental NGOs. These two changes alone,’ he says, ‘have improved the way we engage with our members and also the way we campaign in support of their interests.’* **\[S6\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Hodson has had social and educational impact by challenging damaging prescriptive practices and championing the validity of alternative forms of English. Her research has been instrumental in developing the methodology of the literacy charity Grimm & Co \(G&Co\), which is based in an area of socio\-economic deprivation and low literacy, enhancing their programmes and helping raise their national and international profile. She has devised and led practice\-based workshops, improving schoolchildren’s creativity, engagement, and self\-esteem, and helping schoolteachers develop new methods for engaging pupils. Additionally, Hodson’s work on dialect has supported teaching and curriculum development at other HEIs in the UK and abroad. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Hodson’s research traces the rise of prescriptive understandings of the English language in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the continued – and detrimental – effects of prescriptivism in the present day. She explores the ways ideologies of language shape how linguistic variation is represented in film and literature, and challenges hierarchical judgments about language use and language users. 

 Prescriptivism holds that there are right and wrong ways to use language, and that speakers of standard English are self\-evidently more intelligent and better\-educated than speakers of nonstandard varieties. Previous research in the History of the English Language established the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as a watershed for language attitudes, when numerous grammar books and pronouncing dictionaries disseminated rules about the ‘correct’ way to speak and write English. This prescriptive ideology, still subscribed to today by non\-specialists, contrasts with the descriptivist approach adopted by academic linguists, who – since the early twentieth century – have subscribed to the principle that all language varieties are qualitatively equal, and that ‘standard’ English is a historical construct. Hodson \(R1\) demonstrates that pre\-existing research into the emergence of prescriptivism has been guilty of retrospective disciplinary mythmaking, praising some grammarians \(Priestley\) for apparently anticipating twentieth\-century descriptivism while damning others \(Lowth, Murray\), without considering the historical context within which they were writing. 

 Since 2009 Hodson has focused on literary representations of language variety, which – she argues – play a crucial role in elaborating and disseminating popular attitudes towards linguistic variation. Semi\-phonetic re\-spelling, nonstandard grammar, and regional vocabulary are repeatedly used to mark the speech of characters who are ‘other’ in terms of class, race, and/or place of birth, implicitly marking such characters as illiterate and uneducated. Through research on the AHRC\-funded ‘Dialect in British Fiction 1800\-1836’ \(2009\-2013; £151,414\), Hodson shows that the early nineteenth century was a key period when such literary techniques took shape, and when cultural formulations emerged about what it means for fictional characters to speak ‘American’ or ‘Yorkshire’ English \(R2, R4\-6\). It is possible to trace a clear line of descent from the practices of dialect representation in nineteenth\-century fiction to present\-day stereotyping of dialect speakers. 

 This insight influences her approach to twenty\-first\-century language use, particularly in an area \(Yorkshire\) where speakers still find themselves discriminated against for their regional language variety, and in educational contexts where people are judged on the basis of written ‘standard’ English. As Co\-I on the AHRC\-funded ‘Language as Talisman’ \(2012\-14; £31,739\), Hodson developed experience of co\-producing research, working with schools and community groups in Rawmarsh \(Rotherham\) to investigate local language use. This project demonstrated that, when eliciting information about how non\-academics think about language, higher quality information and better engagement is achieved if the project is not framed in prescriptivist terms. Hodson’s work thus has an important contemporary dimension, as she investigates ways in which the language of socially and geographically marginalised groups is represented in film, literature, and popular culture \(R3\). She has found that influential messages devaluing and delegitimising linguistic variation continue to be transmitted through these media, reinforcing and normalising language discrimination.

 Impact on G&Co 

 G&Co is based in Rotherham, an area with high social deprivation and low literacy. In 2015, 24.3% of children were affected by income deprivation \[S1\]; literacy results for 11\-year\-olds were consistently at least 5% below national benchmarks \[S2\]. A high percentage of the schools G&Co works with have higher than national averages of pupils on pupil premium \[S3\]. 

 Hodson joined G&Co as a founding Trustee in 2014, supporting G&Co’s growth from a small, peripatetic charity to an organisation with a permanent home \(from 2016\), national profile, and steady financial footing \(£115K p.a. in Arts Council funding 2018\-2022; £150K from Paul Hamlyn Foundation to deliver teacher development training for ten schools, 2020\-22\). The growth of G&Co’s reputation and profile beyond Yorkshire is evidenced by BBC R4’s ‘Grimm & Co’ programme \(Nov 2019\), a dramatisation of stories written by children at the charity \[S2\]. 

 Hodson’s research underpins G&Co’s principles of non\-prescriptivism. ‘Devious Dictionary’ \(2014\-15\) comprised workshops with writers, artists, and 100 schoolchildren. ‘Hodson innovatively imported a methodology used in museums education – ‘Object Dialogue Boxes’ – into a literacy setting. Using objects as catalysts, children invent words and explain their meaning. This changes children’s relationship with language: rather than being told how to spell, or that words are not in the dictionary, they are given authority to explore language as a site of shared creativity. The project created a dictionary of new words, sold in G&Co’s shop \(249 sales, 2016\-18\). Creating physical products impacts positively on contributors, ‘providing purpose and value’ \[S2\]; as one child said, “ *it boosts people’s confidence because it feels like things are getting recognised”* \[S4\]. Hodson disseminated the project at a 2015 conference organised by London\-based writing and mentoring centre Ministry of Stories, sharing good practice and raising G&Co’s profile. 

 In ‘Unthinking’ \(2015\-16\), Hodson scaled up the methodology from individual words to narrative. Workshops with schoolchildren used oral, collaborative storytelling and positioned writing as an exchange of ideas, removing ‘fear of the page’. This project – challenging conventional ways of thinking about literacy by valuing every child’s knowledge and disregarding grammatical rules – proved transformational for G&Co \[S5\]. Eliciting and developing knowledge children have \(rather than training and telling\) is now core to G&Co’s approach. ‘Unthinking’ ran three more times in 2017. Its method was subsequently applied to punctuation in ‘Unruly Rules’ \(2017\). ‘Unthinking’ raised G&Co’s national profile when showcased at the UK Literacy Association Conference \(2018\), and Hodson represented G&Co at ‘Word Up\!’ \(Amsterdam, 2018\). 

 Impact on schoolchildren 

 By 2018, G&Co had engaged with 6,000 schoolchildren \[S5\], including hard\-to\-reach demographics, e.g. twelve Roma\-heritage children – a marginalised minority community, with a record of low school attendance and attainment – with whom Hodson worked on ‘I Come From’ \(2013\-14\), producing exhibitions of the children’s creative pieces displayed at the University and Hepworth\-Wakefield, bringing the children into cultural spaces they do not usually access. 

 ‘This is what Articulate Sound Like’ \(2015\) collaborated with fifteen Y7 pupils from Winterhill School, where 30%\+ of students are ‘disadvantaged’ \(i.e. in care/recipients of free school meals\), and 20% speak English as an additional language \[S1\]. After the project – collecting distinctive Yorkshire words – almost 80% reported being more interested in learning \[S6\]. 

 Hodson’s non\-prescriptivist, child\-centred approach increases schoolchildren’s confidence, sense of creativity, and social interaction. 100% of parents interviewed after an ‘Unthinking’ programme agreed their children had improved in all these areas \[S7\]. As one stated, “ *When she comes here, she feels confident and expresses her ideas without fear of being laughed at. She has a more developed interest in creative writing and reading*”. Another noted their autistic child had been “ *totally switched onto writing*”. 

 This positive impact is evidenced by G&Co’s 2019 report \[S3\], where the gap between the blue and red lines shows the change in children’s self\-assessment \(fig. 1\): 

 
Teachers also report significant improvements in pupils’ confidence, imagination, openness to new things, communication skills, and attitude towards writing \(5\+ in all categories, on a scale of 1\-6; S3\). 

 Impact on schoolteachers 

 G&Co’s methods impact on teachers who see first\-hand their effectiveness for fostering pupils’ creativity and concentration. A 2018 Arts Council report states teachers ‘were taken aback’ by children’s responses and focus, particularly boys and children with special educational needs \[S8\]. Teachers’ appreciation of G&Co’s methods is evidenced by the fact that 96% of visits result from word\-of\-mouth recommendations by teachers/schools \[S3\]. Teachers report that attending G&Co workshops influenced their pedagogical practice \(average impact, 5\+, on a scale of 1\-6\); as one teacher wrote, “ *As part of our reflection on the visit, we recognised that we don’t give the children enough opportunities to be imaginative in a freer way. We have tried to change our literacy curriculum as a result”* \[S3\]. 

 Hodson’s research also influenced teaching practice through workshops for schoolteachers, such as one held for eighteen teachers in 2014. Flipcharts show teachers adopting ‘Object Dialogue Boxes’ and collaborative/intergenerational story\-telling, as well as equipping children to conduct research, and recognising the significance of accommodating different linguistic registers \[S9\]. 

 Impact on HE 

 The first book on dialect in literature for over 30 years, and the first to study dialect in film, Hodson’s 2014 monograph ‘rekindled interest in teaching English dialects and their representation in different cultural fields’ and *‘*opened up new areas of study’ \[S10\], leading to new modules at Cardiff and Birmingham, and contributing significantly to modules at Liverpool, Kent, and overseas at Bielefeld \(Germany\), Lille \(France\), Rome \(Italy\), and Toronto \(Canada\). At least 2,000 students have been taught from the book.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Against a backdrop of serious decline in the teaching of Asian religions in England and Wales, Black’s and Ram\-Prasad’s research has reinvigorated and enriched the understanding of Hinduism and Buddhism amongst teachers and students of Religious Education \(RE\). Black and Ram\-Prasad have shared their research through annual teachers’ conferences, regular school visits, and extensive capacity\-building resources. These activities led to enhanced understandings and updated teaching practices, and were linked to improved student exam performance. In some cases, teaching programmes were saved. The research has also inspired teachers and students to challenge gender stereotyping about Asian religions and has supported a shift towards a more pluralistic and inclusive approach to RE, one more appropriate to today’s multi\-ethnic and multi\-faith society. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Research by Black and Ram\-Prasad has brought attention to the importance of the dialogue form in the scriptures of Hinduism and Buddhism. In the process, it has demonstrated that key source texts are often more polyvocal and inclusive in relation to gender and class than has generally been assumed. The research has shown that the dialogue form invites ways of reading South Asian religious texts that are more open\-ended than scholars and school syllabi have recognised. Black and Ram\-Prasad have shown that, rather than approaching scripture as didactic commandments, Hindu and Buddhist texts use dialogue to convey the subtlety and complexity of key doctrines. 

 In 2015, Black conceived and co\-edited the first collection of academic essays to explore the uses and implications of the dialogue form across Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain texts \[R1\].  Both Hinduism and Buddhism have been criticised in the West for their attitudes towards gender and class. Black demonstrated however, that dialogue conveys views of gender and class that are more complex and nuanced than had widely been assumed.  His chapter, which compared dialogues from 3 classical sources \(2 Hindu and 1 Buddhist\), showed that the form explicitly addresses issues of gender and class in ways that complicate and challenge how these identities are represented in more didactic scriptures, and that the purported views of women and members of lower classes are often represented more positively than previously recognised \[R1, R2\]. 

 In 2016, Black and Ram\-Prasad secured funding to build upon this initial research \[G1\]. This resulted in an edited volume that further explored dialogue across Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain texts \[R3\]. Black’s chapter \[R4\] compared Hindu and Buddhist dialogues to show how the form addresses religious plurality and conveys different yet overlapping understandings of *dharma* \(moral order\); Ram\-Prasad’s chapter \[R5\] shows the complex portrayal of Hindu theology conveyed through dialogue, while also drawing attention to subaltern contributions to Hindu conceptions of the divine. 

 This was followed by Black’s 2020 monograph \[G1, R6\], the first extensive investigation into the uses and implications of dialogue in the Hindu epic, the *Mahābhārata.* Black shows that the *Mahābhārata*’s use of dialogue is integral to how it represents the central religious ideas and practices of Hinduism. He brings out 3 dimensions of dialogue in particular: the way it contains embedded methods of philosophical reasoning, the way it represents different perspectives, and the way it provokes readers to reflect further on the main teachings of the text. 

 Owing to research by Black and Ram\-Prasad, there is now an improved understanding of the uses and implications of dialogue in primary Asian religious sources. Their research is particularly relevant to RE, because the changes to the GCSE and A level specifications in 2016 require teachers and students to engage more closely with primary sources. Moreover, their work is a reference point for contemporary comparative philosophical debates and has relevance to an increasingly multicultural society.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 In an increasingly multicultural Britain, Asian religions have a growing presence. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, followers of Hinduism rose by 276,584 \(49% increase\) and numbers following Buddhism rose by 109,768 \(72% increase\). Despite these demographic changes, RE provision at GCSE and A level has become more focused on Abrahamic religions. This is largely a consequence of exam boards’ responses to the Department for Education’s \(DfE’s\) demand for greater emphasis on primary texts. Data supplied by the OCR and AQA Exam Boards suggest that there are approximately 54,600 GCSE entries each year in England with Buddhism or Hinduism options, while approximately 2,250 A level entries feature one of these options. At all levels, the DfE has demanded much greater emphasis on the use of primary texts. However, RE teachers struggle to meet this demand for a combination of reasons. Many RE teachers are non\-specialists with limited subject knowledge; a GCSE textbook, endorsed by Edquas, did not become available until spring 2020; and while there is an AS level textbook, there are no dedicated resources for final year A level students. Consequently, fewer teachers have felt confident in their subject knowledge of Asian traditions, positioning Hinduism and Buddhism as increasingly neglected topics within religious education. This predicament facing the teaching of Asian religions in schools first became apparent to Black in 2014 while carrying out student recruitment campaigns on behalf of Lancaster University. 

 **Reversing the decline in the study of Asian religions in schools** 

 Research by Black and Ram\-Prasad has supported the continued teaching of Asian religions against a backdrop of inadequate teacher knowledge and a critical lack of resources. Since 2014, Black has worked closely with teachers to design a series of resources and activities that draw on his and Ram\-Prasad’s research findings \[R1\-6\]. These include illustrated PowerPoint presentations, videos, and interactive worksheets. Resources have been shared primarily through teachers’ conferences and school visits and have also been widely distributed via Black’s 250\-strong network of RE teachers, social media groups, the National Association for Teachers of Religious Education \(NATRE\) and the Online Resource Centre for Religious Education \(ORCRE\). Additionally, in the spring of 2020, Black created a series of 35 podcasts which became a vital resource for online teaching during the COVID\-19 lockdown. These resources had been viewed 2,129 times by December 2020 \[S9\]. Between 2014 and 2019, the teachers’ conferences had been attended by 353 different teachers and Black had visited over 25 schools. Black is recognised in the religious education community as an expert point of reference for teachers, educational bodies, and exam boards who need support with Hinduism or Buddhism to meet syllabus specifications \[S1\-S7\]. Feedback from the 2019 teachers’ conference showed that 92% of delegates teaching Buddhism, and 82% of those teaching Hinduism, planned to adopt these new teaching resources and methods \[S8\]. 

 Through this series of activities and resources, Black and Ram\-Prasad have been able to reverse the decline of the teaching of Asian religions in a number of ways. They have reinvigorated teachers \[S1\-7\] and helped to bring ‘a new confidence’ to the teaching of Asian religions \[S6\]. The Chair of NATRE has indicated that the activities and resources have contributed to the preservation of Asian religion programmes in some schools, while in others they have inspired teachers to include Asian religions for the first time: “ *I feel sure \[Black’s input\] contributed towards teachers continuing to teach Asian religions, or making the leap to teaching them for the first time. Without this input, fewer teachers would have wanted to offer these subjects*” \[S7\]. One teacher confirmed that the support offered by Black was instrumental in encouraging her school to begin teaching Buddhism \[S1\]. In another example, a teacher credited Black’s resources with saving the teaching of Hinduism at his school: “ *Without the resources, no teacher is going to want to work on the options for Asian religions. The research and preparation time involved places a totally unrealistic load on teachers and our school would definitely have stopped teaching Hinduism without Brian’s contribution”* \[S3\]. 

 **Improving literacy and building capacity amongst teachers of Asian religions** 

 Additionally, Black’s and Ram\-Prasad’s research has improved teachers’ literacy about Asian religions. Their research has become increasingly applicable to teachers who have had to engage more deeply with primary texts to meet new exam board specifications \[S8\]. As the Chair of NATRE has confirmed, resources for teaching Asian religions are especially important because these traditions demand “deep subject knowledge and the availability of contemporary research” \[S7\]. Their research is particularly relevant because it relates to texts that are included in the specifications \[R1\-6\] and because it explores how, within these texts, the dialogue form plays an integral role in articulating and characterising key concepts on the specifications, such as *dharma*, *karma*, *yoga, bhakti*, and *varna* \[R2, R4\-6\] *.* Black’s and Ram\-Prasad’s activities and resources contribute to improving literacy by bringing attention to the dialogical form and structure of Hindu and Buddhist sources and by showing how central doctrines in the texts are articulated in ways that are far more subtle and multi\-faceted than are widely recognised. Better understanding of the primary sources and of how they represent their main doctrines are of direct relevance to teachers’ capacity to teach optimally in the classroom: “ *Deeper knowledge and understanding has given me a much greater appreciation of the texts and their value in teaching, especially the value of using story/narrative*” \[S8\]. 

 Teachers highlighted that the step up from teaching GCSE to A level under the new regulations is very large, one that they felt ill\-equipped to make: “ *Prior to my involvement with the conferences, I had only taught Hinduism at GCSE level and they were an invaluable and transformative opportunity to update my subject knowledge”* \[S4\]. Feedback from all participants at the 2019 teachers’ conference demonstrated that the research findings made an extremely constructive and positive contribution to their teaching, aligning teacher’s knowledge and capacity with exam board expectations \[S8\]. The Head of the AQA Exam Board for RE stated: *“\[Black\] has the ability to distil high level academic expertise in a way that secondary school teachers can take forward in the classroom*” \[S6\]. As one teacher testified: *“Teaching via the texts was not something I had considered, and the conference has really helped me gain an insight in to how I can adapt my teaching for the benefit of my students”* \[S8\]. 

 **Improving educational outcomes for students of Asian religions** 

 Black’s school visits have also contributed to improved understandings among students. Through 10 annual school visits, Black reaches approximately 500 AS/A level students each year. Considering that approximately 2,250 students take exams in Buddhism and Hinduism every year, Black’s visits reach a high percentage of students studying these religions in England and Wales. In 2017\-2018, 77% of 253 students stated their understanding of Hinduism had changed and 98% stated they had learned something new \[S10\]. “ *\[Black\] was able to identify and bring to life the underlying concepts in a way that the students could grasp and understand…He showed how a single story has multiple dimensions and perspectives and can be used to illustrate many different points of view. The dialogues helped to anchor learning and the lessons become a lot more memorable”* \[S3\]. Moreover, interaction with the research has changed behaviour on the part of students, igniting a new interest in the subject: “ *To work with a real\-life Hindu\[ism\] scholar was a much more stimulating and enriching experience for them than referring to a textbook”* \[S5\]. After school visits in 2017\-2018, 58% of students reported that they were likely to continue with the study of Asian religions after school, either formally or informally, with many making reference to the way the research had ignited a passion for the subject \[S10\]. Teachers spoke of the inspirational impact of Black’s school visits, which had directly influenced some students’ subsequent higher education and career choices \[S1, S5\]. 

 Furthermore, feedback from teachers pointed to an improvement in exam grades. An AQA A level examiner explained: “ *Students who have used Brian’s resources can handle the exam specifications in more depth and support their arguments with a wider range of examples. Their understanding is definitely deeper and they demonstrate higher levels of ability in analysis and evaluation*” \[S1\]. Another teacher confirmed an improvement in exam grades: “ *Our A level students have consistently achieved their best results on the Hinduism paper in recent years, which represents a third of their overall A level mark. I attribute this to the fact that I am now very confident about what I am teaching, which I can relate back to the encouragement and subject expertise that I have acquired at Brian’s conferences and through our ongoing contact*” \[S4\]. 

 **Redressing assumptions around gender stereotypes in Asian religious texts** 

 Sociological aspects of Hinduism and Buddhism, including gender and class, are heavily emphasised in GCSE and A level specifications. Unfortunately, the representation of Hindu and Buddhist views on gender and class in the most widely available textbooks and resources often perpetuate unwarranted prejudices and reinforce Western attitudes of superiority. According to INSIGHT UK’S *A report on the state of Hinduism in Religious Education in UK schools* \(2021\), 75% of Hindus felt that Hinduism is not taught in a positive light. In particular, respondents were dissatisfied with teaching on gender and the caste system. Research by Black and Ram\-Prasad demonstrates that Hindu and Buddhist conceptualisations of gender and class \(including caste\) are far more complex and nuanced than has widely been assumed \[R1\-6\]. Engagement with their research has disrupted prejudices and changed understanding among teachers and students alike. One teacher who is also an AQA examiner commented: “ *There is a particular focus in the syllabus specifications on the role of women in Buddhism, but standard recommended texts based on the Theravada can be very negative in their interpretation. Through working with Brian, I have had access to texts written by female monastics and modern female scholars with a much more positive angle which has changed my own perspective and the way I teach*” \[S1\]. The usefulness of Black’s contribution to re\-examining representations of gender is strongly referenced in teacher feedback. One sixth of the current A level paper examines equality and discrimination and as a teacher noted "" *It could easily become a social issues unit, but it must be rooted in the faith. Here \[Black’s\] research on the Mahabharata has been invaluable to illustrate some of the feminist principles it embodies*” \[S2\]. Students also stated that their understanding of the gender dimension had been enriched: “ *I realised that there are a lot more debates and contradiction towards the status of women throughout scriptures*” \[S10\]. Black’s contribution to advancing the understanding of gender aspects within the texts is supported by the topic being the most popular choice in his series of online resources \[S9\]. 

 **Promoting more inclusivity and worldviews in religious education** 

 As demonstrated by the Commission on RE’s \(CoRE\) recommendations in 2018, there is a movement within Religious Education to include the worldviews of practitioners, rather than focus exclusively on the institutional versions of religious doctrine. Black’s and Ram\-Prasad’s research is particularly relevant to this educational development, as their exploration of dialogue brings attention to the multiple views represented within sacred literature \[R1\-6\], as well as to the diverse ways religious teachings have been interpreted and understood by practitioners \[R4, R5\]. As one teacher explained: “ *Through his work in schools, \[Black\] has also supported the shift towards ‘worldviews’, demonstrating the fluidity of Hinduism and how belief as illustrated in the scriptures can differ widely from actual practice*” \[S5\]. Students from Asian religious communities have greatly benefitted from their engagement with the research because it encourages them to interpret the sources of their religion within the context of their own lives, enabling them to link their faith back to their own lived experiences. The Chair of NATRE confirmed: “ *This can be a very mind\-opening and valuable experience”*’ \[S7\]. 

 Although teachers recognise that “to learn effectively, young people need to be able to recognise themselves and that the experiences they are bringing to classes have intrinsic value”, teachers are also increasingly aware that students from “non\-Abrahamic religious communities struggle to relate to or reconcile their own lived experience to what they are being taught in schools” \[S7\]. Moreover, INSIGHT UK’S report \(2021\) stated that many Hindu parents are concerned that the negative portrayal of Hinduism in the classroom results in an insensitivity towards Hindus. In this context, the resources provided by Black and Ram\-Prasad have provided an opportunity for students from Asian communities to see their tradition represented in a positive and meaningful way that is relevant to their own lives, as well as to the lives of others. As one teacher explained: “For students who belong to Hindu or Buddhist faith communities, the teaching of Asian religions in UK schools is a very empowering experience as it demonstrates an appreciation and understanding of their faiths, which validates their place in British national life *”* \[S5\]. At a time when an understanding of Asian religions has become more vital than ever, Black and Ram\-Prasad’s activities and resources have made a major contribution to this goal by reinvigorating and enriching how these traditions have been taught in schools.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Centre for Mathematical Sciences \(CMS\)’s research has led to increased engagement and involvement with mathematics and science for thousands of pupils and hundreds of teachers, so raising pupils’ aspirations and interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics \(STEM\). In addition, CMS research has increased the public’s contact with applications of Data Science through extensive contributions to Plymouth Argyle Football Club’s \(PAFC\) website and programme, outreach publications with international coverage, and a BBC radio programme reaching one million listeners.

### 1.  Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Relevant CMS research represents new, ground\-breaking methodological and applied work in Bayesian inference and its applications, mathematics and statistics pedagogy, and Big Data analysis. 

  

 Stander and Dalla Valle’s research used Bayesian copula models to analyse paediatric ophthalmic data from nearly 3000 children, providing insights about the processes which determine transformations in sight as children age and an innovative tool that enables clinicians to identify children with unusual sight who would otherwise be missed \[3.1\].   Stander and Dalla Valle then used Bayesian survival analysis in the context of historical data sets, presenting insights about changes in longevity over time and producing interesting teaching material including Lexis diagrams illustrating the results of Bayesian inference \[3.2\]. Subsequently, Stander developed a Bayesian change\-point analysis methodology in a geoscience context that demonstrated that the geographic spread of marine calcifiers was driven by both seawater chemistry and temperature \[3.3\].  This Bayesian change\-point research informed a study by Eales and Stander of changes in English league football since the foundation of the Football League in 1888, which provided a better understanding of the decline in English football before the World Cup victory in 1966 and its subsequent improvement \[3.4\]. 

  

 CMS has also made wide ranging and important research contributions to mathematics and statistics pedagogy.  For example, Craven and Sharp analysed whether a university Foundation Year provided an enhanced transition to mathematics degrees compared with the traditional A\-level route \[3.5\]. This was important as the transition from school mathematics to university\-level STEM courses is often problematic, leading to issues with student satisfaction and retention sometimes referred to as the “Mathematics Problem”.  Specifically, Craven and Sharp examined a partially flipped learning approach aimed at improving Foundation Year retention and enhancing the mathematical knowledge of those progressing to undergraduate study.  This research into HE pedagogy complemented both \[3.2\] which discussed how the teaching of statistical topics such as Bayesian survival analysis can be enhanced by focusing on innovative applications and the prize\-winning research by Stander and Dalla Valle in \[3.6\] \(Jackie Dietz Best Journal of Statistics Education Paper Award\).  \[3.6\] discussed our experiences of teaching an intensive Data Science module, with topics including data manipulation, data visualization and the importance of reproducible research.  It also provided four lesson plans.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The teaching of mathematics in school and HE frequently fails to engage learners.  In schools there is a shortage of real\-life examples to illustrate the subject’s relevance, and this can lead to a lack of interest and retention in the subject.  Any failure to engage pupils means that children may be discouraged from studying STEM.  There are also clear benefits from increasing public engagement in mathematics and science at all ages.  CMS has contributed to tackling these participation issues through a large, research\-based schools programme, and through public engagement, including collaboration with PAFC.  This has increased pupils’ understanding and enjoyment of STEM and generally raised awareness of the Mathematical Sciences. 

  

 **Increasing pupil engagement with the Mathematical Sciences** 

 UK businesses have warned of a growing skills shortage in STEM, which may cost £1.5 billion annually due to training requirements and unfilled vacancies.  Many young people see STEM as irrelevant due to the academic nature of teaching in schools.  Enhancing pupils’ Science Capital \(SC\), defined as the sum of all the science\-related knowledge, attitudes, experiences and resources that individuals accumulate, is of vital importance.  SC is known to be an important factor in enhancing individuals’ life chances.  As over 20% of young people have low SC, CMS has used its research to increase SC by creating activities that deepen pupils’ curriculum knowledge and that raise their interest, engagement and aspirations. 

  

 For example, Stander and Dalla Valle’s research \[3.1\] on identifying children who have unusual eyesight, and who therefore need clinical intervention, was used to create a schools workshop.  Pupils can easily relate to this research and were taken through computer\-based exercises that allowed them to apply the research methodology to identify children with sight anomalies.  To evaluate this activity’s success, 96 pupils attending a 2019/20 Year 10 Taster Day completed a questionnaire.  They experienced an increase in their understanding of mathematics \(84%\) and enjoyed seeing research \(83%\).  A majority said that being exposed to this research had increased their interest in mathematics \(57%\), whilst 39% reported an increased likelihood of studying subjects related to mathematics.  Corresponding percentages for a Year 12 Taster day based on 18 pupils are 88% \(understanding\), 100% \(enjoyed\), 50% \(interest\) and 44% \(studying\) \[5.1\].  When followed up after around two years, attendees at a 2018 Year 10 Taster Day provided the following reflections: “The time at Plymouth University was a unique experience…The teachers at the university demonstrated, with great understanding, ideas about mathematics that blew my mind.  They showed me a new way of looking at the world… and a different way maths could be used and applied in a situation.  At the end of the day, I was inspired by the events I had seen, which I feel impacted my future, as I am now applying for apprenticeships in a maths/science field of work.”  Similarly, a teacher reported: “The sessions gave students the chance to see a different perspective on many of the mathematical concepts they learn about in school and gave them the opportunity to delve deeper into areas of maths that they were interested in. The students came away from the sessions enthused towards the possibilities that studying maths can create for them”. \[5.2\] 

  

 We strategically target under\-achieving schools for all our Taster Day and similar activities.  We estimate that 20% of the students who attend our events are “first generation” as 50% come from postcode areas in the lowest two quintiles for HE participation.  In 2018/19 CMS Taster Days were attended by over 300 pupils who were asked to rate on a 0 to 5 scale how challenging they found their research\-informed activities \(average rating, 3.8\) and how much they enjoyed them \(4.4\).  Pupils were pleased to see a “different kind of maths”.  Sharp and others gave seventeen Children’s University Masterclasses and seven Royal Institution presentations.  The whole programme involved 2600 students and 230 teachers from 200 schools.  CMS also offers research\-based activities for summer work experience pupils.  One of these activities led to a pupil producing a publication in *Significance* about visualizing regional data which has received over 30,000 views.  There has, of course, been disruption to our more recent pupil engagement programmes due to Covid\-19. 

  

 **Increasing public awareness of the Mathematical Sciences** 

 CMS research reaches countless people during the football season, resulting in a greater public awareness of the applications of the Mathematical Sciences.  Research on data presentation including \[R6\] and modelling changes in the English football league \[3.4\] has underpinned over 50 articles for the PAFC web site \[5.3\] and 100 contributions to the PAFC match programme *The Pilgrim*, selling 1000 copies at each of 23 home matches per season, written by Eales \(pen\-name Statso\).  These *‘For the Record’* articles have contributed to *The* *Pilgrim* being named the top programme in Sky Bet League One in 2018 and 2019 \[5.4\]. The Midland Programme Club stated that there was an *“Outstanding amount of stats throughout the issue – credit to the stat man* \[Eales\] *\!”.*  This has also resulted in PAFC’s content team being shortlisted in the Best Football Club category of the Football Content Awards 2020 \[5.5\].  Richards, the Premier Programme Editor, confirmed \[5.6\] that *The Pilgrim* had been awarded 9/10 for original content and for 8/10 for design and layout.  In a questionnaire about *The Pilgrim*, 27% of 98 fans stated that *‘For the Record’* was their favourite feature.  Eales has also contributed statistical material to the Jack Leslie Campaign which in the spirit of the BLM movement aimed to celebrate diversity and combat racism, and which raised over £100K to honour a PAFC footballer denied an England cap because he was black \[5.7\]. 

  

 In 2016, the BBC picked up CMS research on the analysis of papal longevity \[3.2\]. This led to Stander taking part in their *More or Less* programme which reaches around one million listeners per week, as the lead story.  Ed Davey, the BBC journalist, wrote that *More or Less* is “the BBC's flagship statistical programme” and considered one of the “Crown Jewels of Radio 4’s current affairs offering”.  He further stated that the fact that Stander’s contribution was the lead story “shows how much we \[the BBC\] valued the piece” \[5.8\]. 

  

 Further public awareness of CMS’s statistics research was achieved through *Significance*, a publication of the Royal Statistical Society and the American Statistical Association, the purpose of which is to explain statistical applications to a broad audience. *Significance* is sent to libraries and outreach organizations world\-wide, and articles more than a year old are free to download.  *Significance*’s Editor Tarran wrote “I’m grateful for the several excellent contributions you \[Stander\] made to *Significance* throughout 2020, and thank you especially for your rapid response to our call for articles to explain statistical aspects of the Covid\-19 pandemic.  Our magazine simply could not exist without the contributions of writers like you, who are able to explain difficult concepts in an engaging and informative way.  The reach of your writing has been invaluable in helping *Significance* achieve its goal of bringing statistics to a wide, diverse audience” \[5.9\].  The nine articles written by Dalla Valle, Eales and Stander since 2015 have received over 79,000 views as of November 2020.  Stander and Dalla Valle have also published an article in *Communicator* magazine about presenting topical statistics.  The print run comprised 1600 copies for members of the Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators, and for delegates at the Technical Communication UK conference and at “tekom”, a technical communication event in Germany. 

 **Improving pedagogical practices in higher education** 

 The pedagogical material resulting from \[3.2\] has enhanced the learning experience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA.  Dr Ellison from the Department of Economics co\-taught a course on data analysis for social scientists with Professor Duflo \(2019 Nobel Prize in Economics\).  “We taught it…in 2016 to about 75 students…we assigned an empirical project to the students, and I used \[3.2\] as an example of a nice data\-driven analysis.  The students were fascinated to see that statistical techniques that they were learning could be used to analyse historical data such as the longevity of popes and yield interesting insights.  I am always looking for new contexts for data analysis to pique the students’ interest, and \[3.2\] provided one of their favourites” \[5.10\].  In addition, Craven and Stander co\-authored the popular *Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics* textbook, 5<sup>th</sup> Edition, Pearson, new sections of which are based on research and experience reported in \[3.1–3.3, 3.5 & 3.6\].

 Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Teesside University on the association between physical activity and colorectal cancer and cardiorespiratory fitness and the effectiveness of jet lag treatments has led to changes to evidence\-based public health guidelines for the UK and USA. Our evidence synthesis research on physical activity and cancer risk, and high\-intensity interval training and fitness, critically informed the official Government physical activity guidelines for population health in the USA and UK. Our evidence synthesis and randomised controlled trial research on jet lag led directly to the co\-production of changes to the guidelines for the management of jet lag in international travellers \(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ‘Yellow Book’, Civil Aviation Authority, the National Health Service, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\).

 Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The impacts in this case study are underpinned by our evidence synthesis and randomised controlled trial research, focusing on the association between physical activity and colorectal cancer and cardiorespiratory fitness, and the effectiveness of jet lag treatments. 

 Insufficient physical activity is one of the major behavioural risk factors for chronic disease. Our research examined the associations between different levels and types of physical activity and health outcomes in two areas – colorectal cancer and cardiorespiratory fitness. A systematic review and meta\-analysis of the association between leisure\-time physical activity and colorectal cancer risk was conducted in 2008\-2009 and published in 2009 \[3.1\]. We estimated summary risk ratios for uppermost vs lowermost categories of physical activity. To quantify dose\-response, we applied a novel bootstrap resampling method to explore risk ratios as a function of cumulative percentiles of physical activity distribution, as heterogeneity in methods of measurement of physical activity levels meant that there was no common metric across the studies. For colon cancer, the research found that greater leisure\-time physical activity was associated with a 20% relative risk reduction in men and 14% in women. The dose–response analysis revealed linear reductions in risk of colon cancer with increasing leisure time physical activity in both genders. 

 Increased cardiovascular\-respiratory fitness is strongly associated with reduced all\-cause mortality. Our systematic review and meta\-analysis of the effects of low\-volume high\-intensity interval training \(HIT\) on fitness in adults was conducted in 2013\-2014 and published in 2014 \[3.2\]. The research showed that low\-volume HIT produces substantial improvements \(6\-10%\) in the maximal oxygen uptake of active non\-athletic and sedentary people. Subsequently, the notion that HIT could be a viable physical activity option for public health benefits was advanced at a debate at the International Society for Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity Annual Meeting in 2015: <ins>High\-intensity exercise as a public health strategy?</ins> This debate was reported in a full journal article \[3.5\]. 

 Jet lag is due to the internal body clock\(s\) of an individual being out of phase with the environmental timing of light/dark and meals after a flight that crosses three or more time zones. In 2017, airlines carried 4,100,000,000 passengers worldwide on scheduled services. The precise incidence of jet lag is unknown, but it negatively affects a substantial proportion of travellers, with symptoms including sleep disorders, daytime tiredness, exhaustion, attention, concentration and memory problems, gastrointestinal problems, and anxiety. We conducted a critical review of jet lag research between 2013 and 2014 \[3.3\]. As part of this review, we undertook an insightful cumulative meta\-analysis that showed the reported effectiveness of melatonin for alleviating jet lag symptoms reduced substantially over time, as higher quality and larger studies were published. This is an example of the ‘decline effect’ in science, where initially large beneficial effects in small early studies are later shown to have been exaggerated substantially. We also led the very first randomised controlled trial on the effectiveness of artificial bright light for reducing jet lag symptoms after a transmeridian long\-haul flight \[3.4\]. We showed that the proposed benefits of bright light, suggested by animal studies and laboratory simulations, do not necessarily translate to clinical/ practical usefulness following an actual transmeridian flight. Previously, guidelines for the treatment of jet lag symptoms have not been informed by higher\-grade evidence. The key novel work that we have undertaken since 2012 is the scrutiny of evidence translation from laboratory studies to real\-world jet lag treatment.

 Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The underpinning research has resulted in changes to evidence\-based public health guidelines for physical activity and jet lag for the UK and USA. Our research has critically informed the current Government physical activity guidelines for population health in the UK and USA. These guidelines are the primary, authoritative, evidence\-based resource for health professionals, policy makers, and individuals on the recommended levels of physical activity to promote population health and reduce chronic disease risk. The development of the guidelines follows a similar process in each country. First, a panel of experts is assembled to rigorously review and scrutinise the evidence base on the relationship between physical activity and health. These experts place primary emphasis on high\-quality systematic reviews. Subsequently, recommendations are drafted, reviewed critically, and finalised. Relevant, high\-quality research used to underpin these recommendations is typically cited in the accompanying scientific reports and working group papers. The live debate at the International Society for Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity Annual Meeting in 2015, and associated paper \[3.5\], acted as a catalyst for the subsequent impact. For the Senior Policy Manager at the UK Government Department of Health and Social Care: ‘the live debate and subsequent paper created a substantial buzz on social media among physical activity scientists, policy makers, and public health commissioners, and stimulated thinking about the potential for very vigorous intermittent physical activity to be included for the first time in the UK physical activity recommendations for public health’ \[5.1\]. 

 Our meta\-analysis \[3.1\] has informed the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. It is referred to eight times in the Cancer Prevention chapter of the scientific report underpinning these Guidelines by the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee \(PAGAC\) \[5.2\]. The report states: ‘one meta\-analysis estimated dose\-response by percentile of physical activity, and found a linear reduction in risk across the 20th to 95th percentiles and estimated risk reductions between these two percentiles of 0.13 in men and 0.14 in women. This same meta\-analysis plotted risk for colon cancer by leisure time physical activity in those studies with MET\-hours per week or MET\-minutes per week data, and found dose\-response risk reductions in both men and women’ \[5.2, p. F4\-17\]. Based on our research, the PAGAC concluded that the evidence grade was ‘strong’ for a dose\-response relationship between increasing physical activity levels and decreasing risk of colon cancer in men and women \[5.2. p. F4\-57\]. Consequently, the Committee recommended that all individuals should be encouraged to engage in the recommended levels of physical activity to reduce risk for developing cancer \[5.2, p. F4\-59\]. 

 Additionally, our meta\-analysis \[3.2\] informed the 2019 UK Government physical activity guidelines. It was cited \(reference \#47\) in the Expert Working Group working paper for adults, presenting the evidence underpinning the guidelines \[5.3\]. Specifically, our findings were used to evidence the benefits of high\-intensity interval training \(HIIT\). Regarding HIIT, the Working Group report states: ‘multiple meta\-analyses and systematic reviews have demonstrated that HIIT has clinically meaningful effects on fitness \(14, 46, 47, 57\), adiposity \(14, 33, 48\), body weight \(25\), and insulin resistance \(25\)’ \[5.3, p.10\]. The final recommendation in the adult guidelines relating to high\-intensity interval activity is: ‘each week, adults should accumulate at least 150 minutes \(2 ½ hours\) of moderate intensity activity \(such as brisk walking or cycling\); or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity \(such as running\); or even shorter durations of very vigorous intensity activity \(such as sprinting or stair climbing\); or a combination of moderate, vigorous and very vigorous intensity activity’ \[5.4, p. 10\]. 

 Importantly, the 2019 update is the first time that HIIT has been included in the UK physical activity guidelines as an option from a menu of choices, based on its demonstrated efficacy in our meta\-analysis and other rigorous evidence syntheses. A Senior Policy Manager at the UK Government Department of Health and Social Care stated: “The rigorous research by Professor Batterham and colleagues on high\-intensity interval training added significantly to the emerging evidence base for the health benefits of performing very vigorous intensity activity in short bouts interspersed with periods of rest or recovery, which led directly to this form of activity being incorporated as an option into the final recommendation for adults” \[5.1\]. 

 Our research has also informed changes to publicly available guidelines on the management of jet lag. The underpinning research provided a completely new insight into jet lag management and was critical of laboratory simulation studies \(including animal studies\) claiming ‘cures’ for jet lag. Prior to the impact of our research, recommendations for managing jet lag symptoms from multiple authoritative sources contained several non\-evidenced claims about treatments and did not focus directly on circadian rhythm disturbances, tending to confuse jet lag and travel fatigue. Following the publication of our critical review and meta\-analysis \[3.3\], we completed an audit of guidelines on jet lag management in the public domain. Guidelines from the following bodies and authorities were scrutinised: The Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\), The National Health Service \(NHS\) Health A\-Z Portal, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\), and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\). We contacted all these authorities enquiring whether they would like us to help formulate guidelines that have a more robust evidence base. We separated those approaches with a good evidence base, for example, appropriately timed light exposure, from those with a weak evidence base \(e.g., dietary manipulation\) and sent the research to these authorities to support our enquires. 

 Previously, jet lag guidelines were not underpinned by robust evidence from studies in humans. Our research led directly to new guidelines from the following authorities, informed by high\-grade evidence. The CDC is the leading national public health institute in the USA. Their ‘Yellow Book’ is published every two years as the definitive reference for health professionals providing care to international travellers and is also a useful resource for any member of the public interested in staying healthy abroad. We co\-produced the new 2018 and 2020 guidelines for travel health with a Health Communications Specialist at the CDC. Our research \[3.3 and 3.4\] was cited and informed changes to the previous guidance \[5.5\]. For example, it was advised in 2016 to “spend time in the afternoon sun”, which was revised to more specific advice on light exposure, including referral to our study on supplemental bright light \[3.4\]. As of February 2019, views for the jet lag page in 2019 and 2020 \(1 Jan\-21 Oct\) were 11,160 and 10,781 respectively \[5.5\]. 

 Similar changes, informed by our research findings \[3.3 and 3.4\], have also been made to the jet lag guidelines produced by the following UK authorities. Working with the UK Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\), we co\-produced new guidelines with the Head of Aviation Health Unit at the CAA and a Specialist at KLM Airways Health Services. These guidelines were made available on the CAA website \[5.6\]. The Head of Aviation Health Unit at the CAA has confirmed ‘that the information on the link on the CAA website is based on the publication Atkinson G, et al., From animal cage to aircraft cabin: an overview of evidence translation in jet lag research. European Journal of Applied Physiology, 2014. 114\(12\): p. 2459\-2468’ \[5.7\]. 

 The NHS Health A\-Z Portal \(previously <ins>NHS Choices Health A\-Z</ins>\) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) have also revised their guidelines on managing jet lag \[5.8, 5.10\]. We reviewed the <ins>NHS Choices Health A\-Z</ins> guidelines as part of a topic review, with reference 3.3 informing the revisions to the NHS Health A\-Z Portal \[5.8\]. This work was acknowledged with a formal letter from the Reviews Editor for Health A\-Z which clearly stated that \[3.3\] ‘was used as a source for the review’ \[5.9\]. In 2019 we co\-produced the Clinical Knowledge Summary \(CKS\) for jet lag management. Our research \[3.3 and 3.4\] is cited in the references for the summary and forms part of the evidence base underpinning the specific recommendations. In his testimonial the Medical Director and Editor for Clinical Knowledge Summaries wrote that “We at Clarity Informatics are very happy to confirm that Professor Atkinson and his colleagues, Prof. Batterham and Dr. Thompson, were instrumental in providing this content and feedback for the jet lag topic” \[5.11\]. 

 Overall, our research has informed and changed national and international evidence\-based public health guidelines on both physical activity and jet lag.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Professor John Holmwood was an expert witness for the defence in professional misconduct cases involving senior teachers accused in the ‘Birmingham Trojan Horse’ affair of religious conservatism and a plot to take over and Islamicise schools in Birmingham, Bradford and Oldham, widely reported in the national and international media in 2014. His report was at the core of the defence case which progressed from August 2015 until May 2017 when the cases collapsed. Holmwood’s research informed a major theatre play based on the affair. The play was seen by 7,933 \(81.5% of capacity\) attendees across the UK in October/ November 2019 and February 2020. Holmwood’s work also influenced the approach of Muslim charities, such as Muslim Engagement and Development and Index on Censorship, to the government’s Counter Terrorism Strategy, Prevent. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Holmwood has researched issues of ethnic and religious difference through the lens of political \(and religious\) friendship \(R1; R2\) to understand the nature of multi\-culturalism in a post\-colonial and post\-secular society. He has also written extensively about the displacement of democratic institutions by markets, especially in the context of education, arguing that this increases centralisation and the possibility of authoritarian action against schools by government as a consequence of the removal of intermediary bodies such as local education authorities. It also creates conditions for populism and scapegoating in political discourse. These themes came together in blogs written at the time the Birmingham Trojan Horse affair first broke \(R3\). On this basis, in 2015 Holmwood was approached by lawyers representing senior teachers at Park View Educational Trust \(PVET\) \(accused in the Trojan Horse affair\), to act as an expert witness in defence in professional misconduct cases brought against them. His report for the court \(R4\) set out how the official reports on which the charges were based had misrepresented the process by which schools were incorporated into academy trusts, had failed to apply official guidelines with regard to religious education and collective worship, and had failed to utilise research commissioned by the DfE on compliance with Prevent \(then understood as part of a duty to promote community cohesion, which government had seen as a particular issue in areas of the country with significant ethnic minority populations\). These would have shown that the PVET schools were more compliant than was typical. 

 For example, R4 outlined that: 

1.  There was a high compliance with the requirement to promote community cohesion on the part of urban schools with large ethnic minority pupil intakes. 

1.  Community cohesion was an approach to multiculturalism that recognised difference alongside a commitment to shared values. This facilitated the identification with being British on the part of citizens with different cultural and religious traditions. 

1.  The issue of community cohesion appeared to be less the unwillingness to integrate, and more a failure by others to include, reinforced by policies on school choice and self\-segregation by white communities. 

1.  The Clarke Report \(to parliament\) into allegations concerning Birmingham schools, \(which had recommended the prosecution of teachers\), failed to establish benchmarks for the investigations of the schools \- e.g., with regard to existing guidelines on religious education and collective worship, how the duty to promote community cohesion functioned in schools and its relation to issues associated with extremism, and the circumstances in which schools could take over other schools \(it required a successful academy, endorsed by Ofsted inspections, and the active involvement of school improvement officers at the DfE\). 

 Following the collapse of the case, without resolution of the guilt, or otherwise, of the teachers, Holmwood wrote a book on the case, co\-authored with Therese O’Toole, University of Bristol \(whose expertise lies in the area of counter\-extremism and Prevent\) \(R5\). The book was written as an expression of ‘public sociology’, on which Holmwood is a significant authority. This research \(R5\) showed the significance of the administrative arrangements associated with the academy schools programme and the centralisation of responsibilities within the DfE which facilitated an authoritarian response by government. R5 outlines a major injustice in the conduct of inspections and inquiries under the aegis of the DfE and its agencies \(Ofsted, Education Funding Agency, National College of Teaching and Leadership\) and Birmingham City Council. This injustice involved in the conduct of public inquiries is argued to be similar to that associated with the Hillsborough affair. Since 2017, Holmwood has been working together with LUNG theatre group on the development of a play, *Trojan Horse*, to publicise the injustice. Together with the writers of the play, he has written about the role of social research and verbatim theatre in the righting of injustices \(R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Trojan Horse affair gave rise to changes in the Government’s Prevent strategy, including a duty on schools to promote ‘fundamental British values’. These values were the same as the ‘shared’ values which schools previously had a duty to promote as part of community cohesion but designating them ‘British’ had the effect of distancing British Muslims from them. Holmwood has been actively involved in questioning this policy, through work with an independent journalist on the role of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission \(among other topics; see B\). 

 **The Court Case: Changing Discourse** 

 In July 2015, Holmwood advised the defence team that the official reports into the affair and the media had failed to take account of the regulatory frameworks applying to schools, including that on their requirements to teach religion and conduct daily acts of worship \(R3\). The schools were, in fact, operating properly within the law, but the media attention had also encouraged some of the teachers and administrators that their own misgivings about the Islamic ethos of the schools was legitimate, and, thereby skewing the evidence that was presented \(but not tested\) in the reports. Holmwood subsequently acted as an expert witness for the defence in the case involving senior leaders at PVET accused of the Islamification of schools in Birmingham. He wrote a detailed evidence report \(R4\), described by the lead barrister of the defence team as *“a substantial and meticulously prepared document”* \(A\), for the court in 2015. 

 R4 highlighted the deficiencies of one of the prosecution’s key evidence documents \- the Clarke Report. Initially, the Clarke report was intended by the prosecution to be background rather than primary evidence, but it was forced into disclosure in the course of the case. This was precipitated by failure to disclose evidence from expert witnesses in the senior leaders’ case, including that of Holmwood, in  a case against junior teachers at PVET that went to the High Court and was quashed \(A\). This led to the identification of other evidence submitted to Clarke but not reported by him, which was judged to indicate serious impropriety on the part of prosecuting lawyers, leading to the **collapse of the case** in May 2017, and, subsequently, **related cases being discontinued**. In the words of the lead defence barrister: *“Professor Holmwood’s report enabled us to counter the established narrative of the Trojan Horse affair and also to argue that the action of the teachers was fully compliant with existing guidelines. Further he identified serious errors in the Clarke Report…It was in our view essential to discredit the Clarke Report. Professor Holmwood’s report was an important part of our efforts in that regard”* \(A\). 

 Holmwood’s involvement with the court case, culminating in the case’s collapse, has had a **profound effect on both defendants and defence**: *“…the teachers were greatly buoyed by Professor Holmwood’s sophisticated and objective account of the circumstances of the case that he provided both in his report and his testimony…. His integrity and commitment to rectify the injustice visited upon both the teachers and their local community has been solitary and greatly appreciated by them … notwithstanding the fact that the teachers have not had the means to pursue further legal remedies…”* \(A\). 

 **The Play: Changing Attitudes through Public Engagement** 

 The key documents that came available during the case, as well as transcripts of cross\-examinations, facilitated the writing of Holmwood’s and O’Toole’s book \(R5\), which has stimulated public debate and created awareness of the injustice experienced by the teachers, whose reputations were damaged and careers ruined on the basis of peremptory action by the authorities. The significance of this research \(R5\) was highlighted by an influential independent journalist \(and nominee for the Orwell Prize 2020\): *“There are very few academic books which have a profound importance in the real world. One of those is John Holmwood and Therese O’Toole’s study of the Trojan Horse affair, Countering Extremism in British Schools? The Truth about the Birmingham Trojan Horse Affair. It is one of the most important and courageous books I have ever read by academics. This is because Holmwood and O’Toole told what really happened in the so\-called Trojan Horse affair in Birmingham in 2014…I cannot praise their work too highly for drawing attention to the injustice done to teachers, governors and the local community”* \(B\). 

 Holmwood’s research depicts a key moment in multicultural Britain, involving the scapegoating of Muslims and the disregard for due process and human rights \(R5\). It has helped shape the development of a successful play about the Trojan Horse case by community theatre group, LUNG \(in conjunction with Leeds Playhouse\). Holmwood played an instrumental role in the artistic development and production, providing academic expertise on early drafts and transcripts, checking the veracity of claims made in the play and contributed to the dramatization \(C, D\). The Co\-artistic Director of LUNG described Holmwood’s contribution to the play as *“…instrumental at every stage of the production \- from creating the script, designing the impact of the tour to delivering the work on the ground when the play toured nationally”* \(C\). 

 The play was performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2018, where it won the **Amnesty International Freedom of Expression Award** \(C\). It has subsequently undertaken two national tours in October and November 2019, and February 2020. There have been 60 performances at 28 venues across the country, attended by over 7,933 people in total \(filling 81.5% of the capacity of the theatre venues\) from various ethnic, professional, religious backgrounds and age groups \(C, E\). Each performance was aligned with a Q&A session and/or a community\-engagement event, at which the questions from the audience were answered by a panel involving teachers, policy\-makers, Members of Parliament, Prevent professionals, governors, local councillors, and Holmwood; 71% of the audience members stayed for the post\-show discussions \(C\); amongst those, there were representatives of 616 schools and community groups \(E\). 

 Feedback survey with 1158 viewers revealed that: i\) 21.5% had **direct responsibility to the delivery of the Prevent strategy**; ii\) 87.8% liked the play “a lot” and would recommend the show; iii\) 33.9% felt that the Q&A session had **changed their thinking**, and iv\) almost all reported **increased awareness** of the reality of the Trojan Horse affair \(E\). For example, viewers said: 

 *“Truths exposed; voices heard. Thank you for telling this story” \(Gender N/A, aged 19 \- 25 years, White British\)* \(E\). 

 *“…very revealing experiences, facts of British societies and core British values.” \(Male, aged 65 years and over, Asian/British Asian\)* \(E\). 

 *“It was awesome\! I didn’t know much about the Trojan Horse \[affair\] before coming into it, so I learned so much\! It was like watching a NETFLIX documentary unravel\!”* *\(Male, aged 26 \- 39 years, White British\)* \(E\). 

 *“It was a valuable element in our ‘UK\-familiarisation programme’. We have moved to the UK and would like to better understand the culture here…* *I just feel super educated, but in a fun digestive way. And moved. And sad. But also inspired” \(Female, aged 26 \- 39 years, “Other” ethnicity\)* \(E\). 

 *“The information given in both the show and the Q&A session was eye opening, shocking and needs to be spread. A responsibility for us all.” \(Female, aged 65 years and over, White British\)* \(E\). 

 *“I want to go and spread the word and advocate.” \(Female, aged 26\-39 years, White British\)* \(E\). 

 Following the immediate success of the play at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Holmwood extended his commitment by ensuring that **wider access** was provided. For instance, he worked with LUNG to organise a special community performance in Birmingham. He was decisive in securing an Urdu translation of the show \(funded by the University of Nottingham\), which allowed another 274 people from 84 different community groups speaking Urdu to access the play \(C\). He was also committed to young people and schools \(a potential interested audience group, captured through the feedback survey, see E\) seeing the show. Thus, *“over 300 students, from schools who had not engaged with their local art venues for 3 years or more, accessed free matinee performances, and a post\-show discussion afterwards with Professor Holmwood”* \(C\). 

 Following the success of the play’s national tour and the aligned Q&A sessions in October/November 2019, on 14 December 2019, LUNG won the **Islamophobia Awareness Month Best Partner Award** from MEND \- a not\-for\-profit organisation, committed to empowering and encouraging British Muslims within local communities to be more actively involved in British media and politics. Holmwood developed relationships with MEND and the All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on British Muslims and, thus, was instrumental in organising a performance of the play at the Houses of Parliament. The performance was scheduled originally for March 2020 and temporarily postponed due to the on\-going COVID\-19 emergency situation \(C\). 

 **Shaping Political Expression and Guidelines** 

 Holmwood’s research and engagement work has been described as “educational” and has challenged political narratives: *“Thanks to his \[Holmwood’s\] wisdom and understanding, I have been able to write much more deeply than would ever have been the case about Muslims in Britain. This includes articles on the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, the Prevent Strategy, Islamophobia in the Conservative Party and the wider narrative around Islam in government”* \(B\). 

 It has also **shaped the political and social campaigns** of activist groups, who are influencing public attitudes and values regarding the **Government’s new Prevent strategy after 2015** \- a new duty on schools to promote fundamental British values that followed from the Trojan Horse affair. The issues associated with the Prevent strategy and addressed in Holmwood’s research and the play \(R5, 6\), have become the focus of his activities with MEND. Holmwood’s contribution to *“…the impact of our \[MEND\] policy advocacy surrounding the infiltration of counter\-terror apparatus into educational settings and the wider operation of structural Islamophobia across the UK policy framework”* was described as “pivotal” \(F\).  Amongst other collaborative initiatives, Holmwood contributed to a MEND Report \- ‘More Than Words: Approaching a Definition of Islamaphobia’. Consequently, the report *“…led to the production of **guidelines** outlining the manifestations of Islamophobia that have since been **adopted by political parties and councils across the country**”* \(F\). 

 Holmwood has also presented training sessions for MEND volunteers on the role of the Birmingham Trojan Horse affair and the use of the Equality Act 2010 in the definition of ’fundamental British values’. In addition, he has collaborated with Index on Censorship \(and MEND\) in addressing the impact of Prevent on the expression of Muslim issues in the arts, preparing a submission for the **Independent Review of Prevent** established by former Prime Minister\(D, F\). Following the removal of the designated Chair in December 2019, the Independent Review of Prevent was suspended by the new Government. Holmwood continues working with MEND \(F\). 

 Holmwood has been collaborating with *This American Life* and *Serial* \- a major public broadcaster from the US which is developing a **podcast series on the Trojan Horse affair**, originally planned for broadcast in Autumn 2020 \(G\). He has already provided six hours of interviews, as well as recording a talk he gave at a London mosque. However, because of Covid\-19 production of the series has been delayed until new year. Holmwood is also working with an independent journalist and leading commentator, on a series of media articles on the mistreatment of British Muslim communities. The first article on the failures of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission was published in Middle East Eye on 24 July 2020  \(H\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Jeremy Gilbert’s widely circulated political and cultural commentary has been cited as influential by journalists, MPs, and key figures at prominent think tanks, NGOs and campaigning organisations. As a significant public intellectual, his commentary and podcasting have shaped and influenced the thinking of tens of thousands of readers and listeners. This influence is underpinned by two decades of research into contemporary politics, culture, and social theory. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Gilbert’s research into contemporary politics and culture, social movements, and political theory over the last two decades has investigated a number of consistent themes. At a conceptual and analytic level, it has sought to continue the tradition of ‘conjunctural analysis’ associated with the classic tradition of British cultural studies, bringing to bear a historical, sociological and critical perspective on emergent social and political phenomena. It presents an historically informed understanding of contemporary culture, politics, and society, interrogating the complex relationships between social, technological, economic, and political change. 

  

 Of most relevance to the wider impact of the academic work, are two central theses: 

-  That, in approaching contemporary social problems and forms of political organization, it is necessary to prioritise democratic methods and aspirations. 

-  That organizations and individuals committed to progressive ends should collaborate and coordinate their activities to achieve realistic objectives, overcoming sectarian and organizational divisions between ‘party’ and ‘movement’ politics, and between representatives of different political traditions \(including liberal, socialist, anarchist, green\). 

  

 This research argues that cultural studies itself needs to be understood as a critical practice with an explicitly public and democratic vocation. Gilbert’s positions were initially laid out in the co\-edited collection *Cultural capitalism* **\(R1\)** and developed in Anticapitalism and culture* **\(R2\)**. This book situated the practice of contemporary cultural studies in the broad history of Anglophone progressive politics and argued for a realignment of forces on the left of British politics. It suggested that alliances between radical movements engaged in extra\-parliamentary activity and the institutions of electoral politics, most notably the Labour Party, were key to political progress, at a time when any such development seemed highly unlikely. 

  

 These ideas were further developed in *Common ground  \(R3\)**, wherein he argued for contemporary politics combining with radical democratic aspirations, sympathy for the tradition of cultural radicalism, and a willingness to challenge the neoliberal political consensus. Gilbert investigated the political implications of contemporary and classical theories of individuation, collective agency, and affect. His formulation of an ethic of ‘collective joy’ in that work has since been taken up by activists and commentators. *Neoliberal culture  \(R4\)** is a collection, edited and with an introduction \(p5\-6\) and a chapter \(p7\-22: “ *What Kind of Thing is ‘Neoliberalism*’?”\) by Gilbert, analysing the nature and scope of neoliberalism as a political project, suggesting important parameters for conceptualizing alternatives to it. 

  

 Gilbert’s own analysis of the current socio\-cultural conjuncture was most fully articulated in his essay “ *This conjuncture: for Stuart Hall”* **\(R5\)** which develops his concept of the ‘long 90s’ \(first proposed in a keynote paper given at the University of Leeds, 2015 subsequently published on Gilbert’s blog\). *Twenty\-first\-century socialism* **\(R6\)** condenses and summarises many of the findings and arguments developed in this work for a wider, non\-academic readership, as have his many contributions to outlets such as *open Democracy* and the *Guardian*.

 *“Jeremy has played a significant role in British public life for many years now; in fact, it is hard to think of many currently working academics who have so consistently bridged the gaps between activism, academic theory and public\-facing commentary.”* Jon Cruddas, Labour MP \( **S1**\) 

 **Influencing campaigning groups, think\-tanks, and politicians.** 

  

 Both of his books, *Common Ground* and *Twenty\-first\-century Socialism,* have been cited as influential by municipal and national elected representatives, senior figures at think\-tanks and NGOs, and activists and political organisers: 

  

-  Neal Lawson, director of Compass, wrote: “ *As a leading advocate for pluralist and radical democratic politics … he has been a direct influence on some of Compass’ key political decisions: e.g., our decision to persistently focus on democratisation of public services and governmental institutions as a key political objective, and our 2017 campaign for a ‘progressive alliance’ of British political parties.* His pamphlet *Reclaim Modernity*, co\-authored with Mark Fisher and published by us in 2015 \( **S2**\), remains foundational to all of our thinking on contemporary politics and culture’, and his 2017 pamphlet on coalitions ‘directly inspired several and successful significant local campaigns during that election.” \( **S3**\) 

  

-  Mathew Lawrence, Institute for Public Policy Research and Common Wealth \(think\-tanks\): *“Jeremy's work was hugely influential on our programme of work \[at IPPR\] exploring political inequality in the UK and how to build a more participative 21st century democracy. Latterly, his work \[… has\] underpinned a new organisation I founded in 2019, Common Wealth, which was set up to design ownership models for a democratic economy.”* \( **S4**\) 

  

 Gilbert has been an informal advisor to prominent Labour MPs including Jon Cruddas, Jon Trickett, Sam Tarry and Clive Lewis, and to some of the most **senior parliamentary advisors** to the party leadership **shaping political debate \(**e.g., **S1, S5\).** 

  

 “*I’ve been consistently influenced, and often directly guided, by Jeremy Gilbert’s thinking and analysis. My critical support for Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour Party, but also for causes such as the Green New Deal, electoral reform and pluralist, multi\-party politics have all been directly influenced by his writing”* Clive Lewis, Labour MP **\(S5\)**. 

  

 During his campaign for the party leadership in 2020, Lewis spoke through national media outlets about the need to address the UK’s ‘crisis of democracy’; a phrase derived directly from *Common Ground* \( **S6a**\). 

  

 **Engagement with public discourse** 

  

 Gilbert’s work has helped to shape and inform public attitudes and values **,** enhancing cultural understanding, challenging conventional wisdom, and stimulating debate. 

-  Extensively cited and interviewed by journalists and commentators in *The Guardian,* *New Statesman* and *Financial Times*, and named by several journalists from *The Guardian* as a key figure on the British Left. **\(S6a\-e\)**. 

-  Work on radical democracy, the legacy of the counterculture, and ‘collective joy’ in culture, music and politics generated a flurry of press interest and interviews in the national and international press 2017\-2019 **\(S7\)** and invitations to contribute to formal discussions of public policy issues \( **S8a\-b**\), as well as a popular podcast on the successful media platform Novara Media, with a lively and dedicated following. The podcasts received 15\-20,000 listeners per episode, representing a significant contribution to public debate **\(S9\).** 

-  The ‘Culture, Power and Politics’ series of lectures, of which he is a principal organizer and presenter, reach a diverse audience outside the academy. He delivers lectures at the Ridley Road Market Bar \(49 Ridley Road, Dalston, London, E8 2NP\) and they are also podcast. Simon Jarvis of Bristol says: “ *As a construction worker with no graduate qualifications, the recorded Culture, Power, Politics lectures have been an invaluable resource for me. Having access to free left\-wing teaching of such a high standard has given me the confidence and the inspiration to become Political Education Officer for my local Labour Party. As well as delivering and running training sessions I have been directly inspired by Jeremy to run reading groups and to take a ‘consciousness raising’ style approach to debates and other political education events* **.” \(S10\)**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Salford’s research challenges the widespread assumption beyond academia that the world of intelligence is secret and unfathomable. It has led to four types of impact: \(i\) correcting the cliché\-ridden media portrayal of intelligence, facilitating a more critical and informed view; \(ii\) increasing understanding of the Freedom of Information Act \(2000\) as an effective tool for researching intelligence; \(iii\) highlighting that much more information about controversial methods of collecting intelligence \(such as torture\) is now in the public domain; \(iv\) arguing there can, and should, be greater engagement with issues of race and diversity in relation to the UK intelligence agencies. Two audiences have been impacted upon by this work: the general public and intelligence practitioners. The work underpinning this case study demonstrates that official material concerning UK intelligence, previously off limits to researchers, can now be accessed; its exploitation is transforming our understanding of intelligence. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research which led to impact on public and intelligence practitioners’ perceptions forms part of a new wave of intelligence history, based on the opening up of previously secret material: it has sought to correct misplaced assumptions about intelligence by exploiting to the full the new opportunities offered by the Freedom of Information \(FOI\) Act. In the absence of official information, there has often been a tendency to fall back on fictional stereotypes, distorting popular views of what spies and intelligence agencies do, and creating unrealistic expectations that agencies are often all\-seeing and all\-knowing with a ‘license to kill’. 

 **2.i. Challenging public, practitioner and media portrayals of intelligence** 

 In the absence of easily accessible information on intelligence and security, fiction has played a disproportionate role in shaping public and intelligence practitioners’ attitudes. Salford’s research challenges the tendency of journalists to rely on a stereotypical James Bond\-esque image of intelligence rooted in fictional and media portrayals, distorting wider understanding of the work of UK agencies. As a consequence, popular views are conditioned by notions of contemporary intelligence as male\-dominated and largely non\-diverse, controlled by all\-powerful agencies, perceptions far removed from real\-world intelligence activities. Murphy’s research on the portrayal of wartime interrogation at Camp 020 \(1940 **–** 1945\) – in this case, the use of physical violence during interrogation – through dramatic reconstruction by the BBC in the early 1980s draws attention to how this contested historical narrative can be given authenticity and credibility in the eyes of the general public, owing to the reluctance of the government and BBC at the time to correct the false impression created **\[3.1\]**. 

 **2.ii. FOI Act \(2000\)** 

 The misplaced belief in the reach of official secrecy has encouraged public audiences and even intelligence practitioners to believe that FOI is not an effective tool for researching intelligence **\[3.2\]**. Murphy and Lomas’ use of FOI legislation has led to the release of new government papers for research that, in turn, has created new knowledge, also showing to others that it is possible to obtain new files under FOI **\[3.2\]**. Illustrative of Lomas and Murphy’s work is the creation of an FOI Archive, a repository holding material on intelligence collected via FOI. Located at the University of Salford and launched in 2016, the collection is an outcome of FOI research and is open to academics and the public. It is home to material on LGBT history, intelligence memoirs including *Spycatcher* and Cold War British intelligence. 

 **2.iii. Controversies over intelligence collection techniques since 1945** 

 Secrecy has also led to a flawed understanding of how much can be discovered about interrogation policies and techniques. This leads the public to put unrealistic and inappropriate pressure on Governments regarding the treatment of prisoners **\[3.3\]**. Newbery has been able to detail the policy\-making processes that led to the use of torture in connection with interrogations during Britain’s retreat from the Empire, the Troubles in Northern Ireland and the Iraq War \(2003 **–** 2011\). This work reveals that the British government and its armed forces did place importance on having appropriate legislation and guidelines in place for interrogation as well as on making it publicly known that they were aware of and abided by this legislation and guidelines. It has shown that although the interrogation of terror suspects sometimes involves torture, the picture is far more complex than popular portrayals would suggest. For instance, interrogation ordinarily involves interviews that fall within legal and ethical frameworks, with torture – although dominating public perceptions – a measure of last resort and in some cases used as a result of sadism and other non\-intelligence reasons **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. 

 **2.iv. Diversity, intelligence and security** 

 False perceptions about government secrecy have also resulted in a lack of engagement with issues of race and diversity in relation to UK intelligence, an emerging theme in Lomas’ work.  Although working on LGBT issues and security since 2016, the issue of race and nationality remained a gap in intelligence studies and one that only really emerged through the release of new file material into the public domain and efforts to decolonise the intelligence studies literature, moving the subject from studies of intelligence operations and agencies to recruitment and inclusivity. Work on this topic led to a report in *The Guardian* newspaper in November 2018 showing that MI5 believed black people to be a ‘security risk’ in the 1960s, as well as a journal article showing how nationality rules and internal government prejudice led to, to use the language of the time, a ‘colour bar’ impacting BAME perceptions of intelligence agency and civil service recruitment – a legacy felt even now **\[3.5\]**. Such work on the cultural dimension of intelligence in the UK is important, as reflected by the findings of the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee’s 2018 report on diversity that acknowledged the UK’s agencies did not reflect modern\-day Britain. It also sheds light on the careers of BAME officials in the agencies and is the subject of an ongoing research project looking at security screening and UK national security. Lomas discovered the 1981 report of the Security Commission – a previously unpublished document – highlighting that sexuality was a significant Cold War security issue even into the late 1980s **\[3.6\]**. Based on this work Lomas was able to advise the Government Communications Headquarters \(GCHQ\) history team for the authorised history of the agency published in October 2020.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Intelligence practitioners represent an audience that is difficult to reach. While the existence of intelligence agencies such as GCHQ, MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service \(SIS\) is not in itself a closely guarded secret, those who apply to work in intelligence are instructed to inform only their closest family of their decision, while those who are employed also sign the legally\-binding Official Secrets Act. As of March 2018, the UK’s intelligence community numbered 13,630 \( [ISC Report, 2018](https://b1cba9b3-a-5e6631fd-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/independent.gov.uk/isc/files/20200721_HC633_CCS001_CCS0620799228-001_ISC%20Annual%20Report%202018-19%20Web_accessible.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cpZ1QNmEuzft3c9df7M-HLXw13jD1PfD4DQiQU3D9mX9ZWyBCTcVfMDYSaVzljocw_q6GHZ34xFSYfC-IRfZ6_I6eIHJ5Nv8EmBWPi2efw4Akyz2HqrAHdfdL8iulmUvfQrFwaCUt7jQv9CAjrh7nS31P314z2HNHj1EGGLTTV_cJy9y1W7LdfAfw6JTrn0SgetE_dfzh-U-oWamIp5irmi7opPjOUBrWR0B0eVAMf1Oo1Uhzo88wh-oRFGCGvl-llZkMNs7qMgIEY9z-cN7F1Gq6PaTVcus_X2e5S6a9yyHZ85Xbi3VNJ3hTyFX-qEpqVYb6WW&attredirects=0)\). To make an impact on this audience therefore poses a significant challenge. Understanding and knowledge gained through our research has benefitted practitioners working in the intelligence and security field through the University of Salford’s unique attendance and distance learning postgraduate taught programmes. The University is one of only a handful of UK\-based institutions offering programmes that are exclusive to intelligence practitioners, the teaching allowing us to develop in\-house community attitudes to intelligence **\[2.i\-iv\]**. Since 2014,165 intelligence and security practitioners have studied with us, representing countries including Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Nigeria, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States. 

 Outside of this closed community, our work has reached a wider audience of **626,000,000 readers, listeners and viewers** through news media appearances between January 2015 and July 2020 **\[5.1\]**. This work directly challenges the popular views of intelligence **\[2.i\]**, arguing that such views are simplistic. Research has also been shared through social media, news publications, with further pathways including workshops, public talks and an exhibition for LGBT History Month in 2020. Social media analysis \(up to 27 July 2020\) highlighted **1,094 public comments**, **2,234 public engagements** \(social media likes\) and **3,326 reshares** of pieces by Lomas, Murphy and Newbery **\[5.2\]**. For *The Conversation*, reports authored by the researchers reached **236,181 readers**. 

 **4.i. Challenging public, practitioner and media portrayals of intelligence** 

 Three\-quarters of the intelligence practitioners surveyed said they were surprised at the quantity of openly available information; running counter to their original views, several acknowledged that there was a ‘ *great deal*’ of material **\[5.3\]**. ‘ *It was surprising that so much is there*’, one official noted, while pointing out that, if you understand ‘ *ways that these can be manipulated further, real benefits can be ascertained*’ – a reflection that intelligence is not always ‘ *secret*’ **\[5.3\]**. Another was ‘ *shocked...I was thinking before my course that these discussion\[s\] were only very limited \[…\] I've learnt \[a\] huge amount*’ **\[5.3\]**. Reflecting on how far their understanding of the world of open source had changed because of study, one practitioner replied ‘ *colossally*’ **\[5.3\]**. 

 Beyond the unexpected quantity of public information, intelligence practitioners reflected on the contrast between the ‘real world’ of intelligence and popular perceptions, views encapsulated by one respondent: *‘Before coming to Salford all I thought was in the public domain was just the “story telling of James Bond*”’ **\[5.3\]**. Another picked up that in the media there were ‘ *James Bond references galore*’. Media coverage of intelligence was ‘ *poorly portrayed*’, most stories having a ‘ *007 association, which is just plain stupid*’. Several were ‘ *very surprised*’ and shocked when they considered the media impact, given, as one noted, ‘ *I didn't realise how much \[fictional\] figures were referred to \[as\] “factual” in the media*’ **\[5.3\]**. Half of all respondents felt that their trust in media portrayals of intelligence had decreased as a result of our research **\[5.3\]**. 

 Respondents also reflected upon the impact of our research\-led teaching on their own professional work. One saw the need to improve policy around the handling of informers. ‘ *It was apparent a large portion of the anti\-poaching squad \[in Malawi\] knew about a particular \[informer\]*’, resulting in a new standard operating procedure on handling these kinds of sources **\[5.3\]**. Another alumnus explained his work practice changed ‘ *dramatically... my mind broadened*’. Another reflected their educational experience had ‘ *opened up my perspectives on security overall, and has allowed me to educate my peers, supervisors, and teams*’, sharing knowledge to develop best practice **\[5.3\]**, a theme reflected in other responses: ‘ *It allows me to engage with experienced practitioners in the field, which allows me the opportunity to continually develop my skills and understanding. I was able to pass on my knowledge of ethics*’ **\[5.3\]**. 

 **4.ii. FOI Act: increasing public and media awareness** 

 Alumni who are intelligence practitioners, as well as the general public surveyed talked of a growing awareness of the UK’s FOI Act as a result of the research. One respondent reported being ‘ *amazed by what people had previous\[ly\] received \[under FOI\]*’ **\[5.3\]**, while another admitted ‘ *I did not know that FOI was also a way of research for intelligence*’. Others were ‘ *surprised*’ at how much intelligence information was available \- despite the numerous exemptions for national security, international relations or sensitive information **\[5.3\]**. Overwhelmingly, respondents declared that the knowledge and methodologies developed by Salford have inspired and helped them to use FOI in their own work **\[5.3\]**. Intelligence practitioners have also said that their awareness of FOI has impacted upon their working practice. A police officer appreciated the importance of diligent record keeping: ‘ *I have to make a record of every decision I make as it may be used as evidence \[...\] Knowing that that information could be made public \[...\] makes it even more important to state accurate and relevant information*’ **\[5.3\]**. Members of the public have also reported a greater understanding of FOI, for example that it does not provide access to all government files **\[5.4\]**. Another respondent stressed that *‘the ability for universities to utilise these documents to help explain our recent past is pretty vital*’ **\[5.5\]**. 

 Following historic claims of child sexual abuse, Murphy was able to identify a file that was held at The National Archives but unavailable to the public and advise *Sky News* on making an FOI request; the file, covering ‘unnatural sex’ and a FO official, was released in January 2015, leading to an urgent question in the House of Commons on 22 January 2015 to the Home Secretary **\[5.6\]**. Murphy’s intervention resulted in the identification of new files; a Cabinet Office Minister admitted in February that, following media reports, Cabinet Office officials identified four further files, passed to the Wanless Inquiry which was set up in 2014 to review historic sex abuse claims **\[5.6\]**. Media reporting on the file, including Murphy’s intervention, reached an **audience of 8,300,000** **\[5.7\]**. After media reports claimed the 2017 Manchester Bombing was an ‘intelligence failure’, work by Lomas argued against ‘hindsight bias’, with the BBC Home Affairs Correspondent commenting that it was ‘ *a good read on why it’s reasonable to expect MI5 to miss threats*’. Another reader added, ‘ *A really interesting article…Combine this with media outlets searching for a headline and writing cheap and easy headlines*’, another commenting ‘ *good summary of the current situation \[...\] the various services responded commendably’* **\[5.7\]**. 

 **4.iii. Changing perceptions of intelligence collection techniques** 

 Surveyed alumni who are intelligence practitioners were surprised at how much information is in the public domain about interrogation techniques and policies, gaining new insights into the importance of transparent policies, allowing agencies to act with honesty and integrity **\[5.3\]**. Attendees at a public talk by Newbery reported a correction to their understanding by learning that there is a ‘wide gap’ between interrogation and torture **\[5.8\]**. 100% of attendees reported increased understanding of how British intelligence, police forces and the military operate **\[5.8\]**. 90% of respondents said the talk made them more critical of how interrogation and torture are portrayed by the media **\[5.4\]**. 

 Evidence submitted by Newbery to Parliament’s Joint Committee on Human Rights was reflected in their October 2020 report into the Covert Human Intelligence Sources \(\(CHIS\) Criminal Conduct\) Bill. The House of Lords has since amended the Bill in keeping with Newbery’s evidence that CHIS – more commonly known as informers – should not be given criminal or civil immunity for murder or torture **\[5.9\]**. 

 **4.iv. Diversity, intelligence and security** 

 Attendees from both audiences at a public talk and exhibition on ‘Security and Sexuality’ learnt that national security and sexuality are linked **\[5.5\]**. Knowledge of the Foreign Office’s attitudes to LGBT officials pre\-1991 showed research in this area was viable, contributing to public knowledge **\[5.5\]**. The importance of this work is underlined by the commitment of UK government agencies and departments to diversify their workforce and acknowledge the wrongs of the past. By working in this field, researchers at Salford help contribute to an environment in which the intelligence and security agencies’ recruitment goals can be achieved, illustrating how far their recruitment practices have changed. Work on this subject by Lomas featured in the first published authorised history of the GCHQ **\[5.10, p. 778\]**, the agency history noting the unofficial advisory role \(‘understand issues and to find evidence’\) played by Lomas in the acknowledgements **\[5.10, p. 805\]**. 

 Research on the subject reached a wider public audience through social media, news stories and FOI. Research by Lomas on MI5 and BAME candidates, initially reported by *The Guardian,* and reprinted elsewhere, reached an **audience of 5,347,385** \( *The Guardian*, *The Daily Mail*, *Irish Times* and *Yahoo\!*\), the story reported across BBC local and national radio via the BBC’s BAME network, ‘UK Black’. Social media analysis identified several impacts: a wider discussion of diversity and the UK’s agencies; drawing attention to the treatment of minorities across government; and highlighting the relationship between past and present for the public, researchers and campaigners **\[5.2\]**. Twitter users found the article contents ‘ *shocking*’, with one post recognising ‘ *The 60’s were only 58 years ago. I have family members who grew up in a time where MI5 thought black people couldn’t be trusted*’ **\[5.2\]**. Social media analysis reveals **938 shares** of diversity\-related work, **1,762 reactions** and **634 comments \[5.2\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 German government ministries have over the last decade commissioned historical research to confront their Nazi past and raise historical awareness among staff and the public. Professor Albrecht Ritschl led a large \(EUR3.9 million\) collaborative research project on the history of the Economics Ministry. Engagement with this research has brought about a new understanding of its own history among the leadership and staff at the ministry, contributed both to the commemoration of staff to have been murdered during the war and to facilitating a meaningful reconciliatory dialogue between the ministry and former members of East German staff, and informed the development of a new training programme designed to enhance understanding of the historical context, objectives, and state interactions of the ministry.

 Since World War I, Germany has gone through several drastic swings in its economic policy model; from the welfare state of the Weimar Republic, to preparation for total war under Nazism, to two vastly different models of postwar economic reconstruction – Soviet style central planning in East Germany and a market\-based system moderated by social policy in the West, dubbed the Social Market Economy. A main driver of multiple economic reforms has been Germany’s large Economics Ministry. Like many other German government institutions, the Economics Ministry has struggled to confront its past as a facilitator of the genocidal Nazi machinery, instead deemphasising institutional continuities from the interwar period and the Nazi economy, in particular. A founding myth developed, which saw postwar West Germany’s economic model as rooted in the pro\-market doctrines of Walter Eucken and the Freiburg School of ordoliberalism. According to this narrative, economic policy in West Germany since World War II was a clean break with an interventionist, near\-socialist past. 

 In 2011, Professor Albrecht Ritschl was asked to assemble an independent task force of historians to comprehensively research the history the Economics Ministry. The aim of the project – supported by a EUR3.9 million grant from the ministry – was to investigate the issue of institutional and policy continuity, challenging the foundational myth described above. 

 The principal output of the project was a four\-volume report **\[1\]**, arranged as a handbook and consisting of chapters authored by 25 leading scholars. Ritschl was a co\-editor of the handbook and authored three of its chapters **\[2\] \[3\] \[4\]**. Key insights of the research to have underpinned impacts described here include: 

-  The ministry developed its pro\-market\-cum\-welfare\-state approach in the 1920s under the direction of Eduard Hamm, a secretary whose long\-term impact had been underestimated in previous research, and who was murdered by the Nazis in 1944. A project to dismantle Germany’s many business cartels fell prey to Nazi war preparation but shaped the West German Competition Act of 1957 **\[1\]**. 

-  During the early Nazi years, the ministry spearheaded major reforms of business regulation, affecting a wide range of sectors. With minor modifications, these regulations became part of the West German Competition Act of 1957 and were only dismantled in the 1980s **\[2\]**. 

-  Ministerial bureaucracy willingly Nazified itself in 1933 but warded off Nazi party ideologues until 1936, when the reform drive had already ended **\[3\]**. 

-  In 1936 the ministry came under the influence of Goering’s “Four Year Plan”. Its role as a driver of economic war preparation and planning was bigger than previously thought. It led the plundering of Western and Southern Europe. 

-  The ministry was an active facilitator in the dispossession of Jews in Germany and later in occupied Western Europe. 

-  Postwar West Germany came close to a full restoration of its interwar economic system in the mid\-1950s. This included a planned return to cartels, the characteristic building block of German\-organised capitalism. Ludwig Erhard was initially seen as a weak Economics Minister and his pro\-market policy considered a failure **\[2\]**. 

-  The major departure from the interwar system came through Constitutional Court rulings which limited the scope of government market intervention **\[2\]**. As a consequence, a bare\-bones competition law could pass and the regulations of the 1930s were adapted to comply with the court rulings. This process was only fully concluded in 1961. The ministry’s role in driving this pro\-market turn was smaller than previously thought. 

-  The economic policies of Erhard’s own ministry were not grounded in Eucken’s ordoliberalism. Its much more pragmatic approach was to support and mitigate structural change, rejecting the static, impractical model of perfect competition in favour of a more realistic, dynamic approach **\[2\]**. 

-  Little continuity existed between Nazi and Communist economic planning in East Germany.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The underpinning research has had three principal impacts. It has: 

-  Brought about a new understanding of its own history among the leadership and staff at the Economics Ministry, uncovering new perspectives, reckoning with its difficult past and challenging previously\-held narratives. 

-  Contributed to the process of commemoration of staff to have been murdered during the war, while also facilitating a meaningful reconciliatory dialogue between the ministry and former ministry staff members of East German origin who had served on the staff of East Germany’s central planning board before unification. 

-  Informed the development of a new suite of web resources and a training programme, which are intended to enhance understanding of the historic objectives of the ministry and how they interacted with the economic structure of the German state. 

 \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- 

 In his capacity as member of the German Economic Ministry’s academic advisory board, Ritschl was asked in 2009 to comment on a book proposal to commemorate the ministry’s reestablishment in 1949. He advised against limiting the scope either to West Germany or to the Nazi years for lack of historical contextualisation, instead encouraging the ministry to confront its full past since its foundation in 1919, to include East Germany under communism after 1945, and to communicate findings both internally and to the wider public. This led directly to the establishment of the project and the task force of historians in 2011. Impacts have been realised throughout the project lifecycle, with those to have occurred during the current REF period described below. 

 The project intended findings of the research to be shared with external audiences but also to enhance understanding and stimulate debate among the ministerial staff \(c. 2,000 employees\). To do so was a sensitive task given the ministry’s limited acknowledgment of its role in Nazi crimes and the persecution of its own staff members, and so a degree of confidence\-building was required at both leadership and staff levels in order to facilitate an open discussion. Accordingly, a series of seven workshops and events \(one in October 2012, the others all during this REF period **\[A\]**\) with ministerial staff, external academics, and members of the public were held to provide a forum for discussion and encourage mutual feedback, including two well\-attended internal conferences chaired by the ministry’s policy director, Alexander Gross. Presentation of the research by Ritschl and the other project participants at these events served not only to deepen and enhance understanding of the ministry’s difficult history among its staff, but also contributed directly to institutional processes of commemoration and reconciliation. 

 A September 2013 event was particularly successful in provoking dialogue among staff. Presentations by Ritschl and others covered the ministry’s complicity with the Nazis and provided details of staff members to have been killed in the 1930s. Subsequent discussion uncovered contrasting views of the former East and West Germans among the staff. Both groups concurred that those staff members who had been murdered by the Nazis should be commemorated in some way, but disagreed on whether those staff who were also communists should be included. All those present welcomed the ministry’s new openness but demanded visible and explicit acts of commemoration and acknowledgment by the ministry’s leadership. The former East Germans also took a strong interest in the East German part of the project, voicing concerns about whether their previous work would be researched accurately and fairly, and offering to establish contact between researchers and former East German officials. This helped to establish a conversation the ministry’s staff had previously felt uncomfortable with, and that had not been encouraged. At their suggestion, a follow\-up meeting was arranged between the project staff in charge, some of the activists among the ministry’s staff, as well as former staff members who had played leading roles in East Germany’s economic planning apparatus. The meeting was welcomed on all sides as a very meaningful step towards reconciliation **\[A\] \[B\]**. 

 In response to the demands for transparency, and to show the ministry’s determination to publicly confront its history at the leadership level, subsequent events were directed more towards public audiences and featured notable contributions from government ministers \( *Staatssekretaere*\). Research findings were presented at a public conference on the Nazi ministry in March 2014, at which the Nazification of the ministry in 1933 and the role of the ministry’s own *Judenreferat* in the dispossession of Europe’s Jews were discussed in the presence of the ministry’s leadership, staff, and members of the public. A second such conference on East Germany took place in October of the same year. In December 2014, a third event \(hosted by and in collaboration with *Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie*, Germany’s business organisation\) discussed the research findings on the postwar West German ministry, including the role of former Nazis **\[A\]**. The Deputy Director General has subsequently confirmed that this session "" *generated considerable interest in confronting the ministry's past. Participants gave very positive feedback and asked for the event to be repeated*"" **\[B\]**. 

 As details from the research were being shared among staff, the Economics Ministry took the decision to name its library after Eduard Hamm, the influential former secretary \( *Reichsminister*\) **\[1\]** and the most prominent staff member murdered for his allegiance to the resistance movement. A public event was held in September 2014, again with speeches by the secretary and the political director acknowledging the role of the ministry in Nazi crimes and honouring the memory of the persecuted among the ministry’s staff **\[C\]**. 

 Material from the project and information on the activities of the history committee was made available on the ministry’s web pages **\[D\]**. Here, the ministry lauds the work of the committee for its incorporation of new or previously overlooked perspectives, and for having “ *developed a comprehensive insight into the function and effectiveness of the economic department. The result is not ‘an exclusively correct interpretation with the sole claim to truth’, but expressly allows for different evaluations and weightings. Important focal points are the analysis of the Nazi era and the* – *largely non\-existent* – *denazification in the young Federal Republic as well as the investigation of the structures in the former GDR*” **\[D\]**. 

 In December 2016, the handbook **\[1\]** was officially launched at an event at the Economics Ministry. Some 225 guests were in attendance, including former secretaries, business leaders, policy experts, and academics **\[E\]**. The event featured speeches and a roundtable discussion and was subsequently widely covered in the German press **\[F\]**, with *Die Welt* hailing the project’s “ *important insights*”, while *Der Tagesspiegel* compared the project favourably with the histories of many other ministries, which had ignored the period of the Weimar Republic and the history of economic policy in East Germany **\[F\]**. Video of the event has been made available on the ministry’s web pages, including a speech by the ministry’s then secretary, Sigmar Gabriel, who thanked the history commission: "" *Your study makes it clear how the terrible catastrophes in German history \- two devastating wars, the failure of the first German democracy, and the National Socialist genocide \- also influenced economic policy strategies*"" **\[F\] \[G\]**. An extended brochure summarising key findings of the research was distributed to attendees and remains available on the ministry’s web pages **\[H\]**. The exhibition was moved to the library, where it remained for a year. Owing to “ *broad interest*” **\[A\]** and “ *high demand*” **\[B\]**, the exhibition was also extended to include scans of key documents. 

 In 2019, the ministry hosted a public event, not to mark the 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the West German ministry, as was originally planned, but instead to commemorate the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of its establishment in the Weimar Republic. Ritschl gave a keynote speech providing a summary of the project’s approach and its findings. In his own speech, the new secretary, Peter Altmaier, again emphasised the importance of the ministry confronting and recognising its full history including its active participation in the Nazi policies of persecution, plundering, and genocide **\[I\]**. 

 The sustainability of the project and its impacts is assured by the suite of new resources created by the ministry. Findings of the research have informed the design of the ministry’s internal training programmes. Staff workshops on “Administrative Procedures and Responsibilities between Constitutional State, Public Welfare, and Official Duty” draw directly on its research contributions **\[B\]**. These workshops, which the ministry confirms have been much in demand **\[A\] \[B\]**, aim to raise staff awareness of the consequences of economic policy by enhancing understanding of the historic objectives of the ministry and how they interacted with the economic structure of the German state. 

 The ministry has also subsequently developed a dedicated historical website **\[J\],** with input from the project. The website combines qualitative archival materials \(images, audio, video\), historical statistics, and a concise, accessible narrative of economic events over the last century of German history. The site has received 40,000 visits since its inception in early 2019 **\[K\]**. 

 Overall, the research has brought about a changed understanding of the Economics Ministry, both among its own staff and at institution\-level, as attested to by the Deputy Director General: "" *The history project that you devised and coordinated has changed the way we think about the history of our institution. Staff have developed a new awareness of what the consequences of economic policies can be if they aren't grounded in a deep commitment to the principles of democracy, economic freedom and social justice. These are the pillars of the Social Market Economy, which has guided the Federal Ministry since its foundation in 1949*"" **\[B\]**.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

1.  **Technological significance:** Food fraud is widespread, costing >GBP20,000,000,000 per year. Herbs and spices have a global trade value of >USD3,000,000,000. The Queen’s University team **developed the first fingerprinting approach to gain ISO accreditation for detection of adulteration**, which demonstrated that >25% of sold oregano was adulterated. 

 **Industrial significance:** This fingerprinting approach **detected adulterants in oregano in the UK, Norway and Australia.** Consequently, business practice changed globally with recognition of the value of identifying fraud. 

 **Economic significance:** A spin\-out company, Cibus, providing services to detect adulteration was formed in 2020, creating four full\-time posts and raising £570,000 in seed funding. 
","
1.  **Underpinning research** 

 Professor Elliott, Dr Haughey and team have spent over a decade researching the detection of economically motivated adulteration \(EMA\) of food **\[3.1; 3.2\].** Traditionally microscopy was used as the industry gold standard for the detection of EMA of dried herbs and spices. This methodology provided a non\-quantitative result and requires highly experienced and skilled individuals capable of differentiating extraneous herbaceous matter present as adulterants. Prof Elliott’s team have developed an innovative quantitative spectroscopy\-based approach to supplement the microscopy method. They applied chemometrics \(the statistical modelling of chemical data\) to spectral data from Near Infrared Reflectance \(NIR\) and Raman spectroscopy to detect the adulteration of chilli powder with Sudan dye, a group 3 genotoxic carcinogen **\[3.1\]**. 

 Having confirmed the feasibility of this approach, the team investigated potential adulteration of oregano and paprika after concerns were raised from an industry source. They developed and validated a two\-tier approach. In the first tier samples were screened using Fourier\-Transform Infrared spectroscopy \(FTIR\) coupled to data analysis using chemometrics **\[3.2\]**. The second tier used Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mass spectrometry \(LC\-HRMS\) to confirm the adulteration **\[3.3\]**. This approach demonstrated that the Tier 1 test was \~90% accurate and could be used as a screening tool for suspect samples, and that the Tier 2 method, which was 100% accurate, was suitable for use as a confirmatory tool. The team advanced the testing strategy by further refining the methodology. They developed a  faster, lower cost Tier 2 test based on identification of biomarkers for purity and adulteration using low resolution mass spectrometry LCMS/MS. This new methodology presented very high selectivity and specificity, excellent linearity, and acceptable accuracy \(intra\-assay 92–113%, inter\-assay 69–138%\) and precision \(CV < 20%\). When compared with the previously established FTIR screening assay it also revealed a good correlation of both qualitative and quantitative results \(R2 > 0.81\) **\[3.4\]**. 

 To complement the laboratory tests, Professor Elliott, Dr Haughey and team explored the development of field\-based testing for food adulteration.  Using miniaturised near infrared detectors connected via Bluetooth to smartphones, they discovered that they could quickly detect adulteration directly where food was being manufactured and sold **\[3.5\]**. Chemometric models accessed through a phone app are stored in an iCloud to facilitate remote access from anywhere in the world. The team partnered with the United Nations joint IAEA/FAO division on these projects **\[3.6\]**.

1.  **Details of the impact** 

1.  Food fraud in its entirety is estimated to cost >GBP20,000,000,000 per year globally due to factors such as increased market competition and reputation loss **\[5.1\].** The global Herb and Spice supply chain trade was valued at over USD21,500,000,000 billion in 2018 and is predicted to reach USD25,000,000,000 by 2025 **\[5.2\]**. 

 The team’s success in detecting adulteration in chilli powder **\[3.1\]** led to British Pepper and Spice \(BPS\), a leading UK retailer of dried herbs and spice, approaching the team in 2014 with concerns over the authenticity of herbs entering the market from Turkey **\[5.3\]**.  BPS supply bulk quantities to the broader food manufacturing industry in the UK and Ireland and had long suspected the adulteration of Turkish herbs, namely sage and oregano, with other much cheaper herbaceous materials. The company felt their market share had been reduced and that there was an increasingly rapid deterioration in the authenticity and, therefore, quality of Turkish dried herbs on sale in the UK and Irish markets **\[5.3\].** To put this into global context, Turkey is a major exporter of herbs and spices, with Turkey’s herb and spice industry currently being worth USD850,000,000 **\[5.4\].** BPS, in partnership with WHICH? consumer magazine, then commissioned  Professor Elliott, Dr Haughey and team to conduct a survey of oregano on sale in retail and food service sectors of the UK and Irish markets. In response to the request for assistance, Professor Elliott’s team employed their two tier fingerprinting technique to test for and identify adulterants.  The results demonstrated that >25% of all retail and food service packs of oregano sold in the UK and Irish markets were adulterated **\[3.4, 5.5\].** Therefore, the pioneering work of Professor Elliott, Dr Haughey and his was central to the detection of adulteration in Turkish herbs **\[3.3, 3.4, 5.3\].** 

 In response to this ground\-breaking industry collaboration, British Pepper and Spice \(2006 – 2018\) stated: 

 “*Working with Elliott and his team British Pepper and Spice supported the development of the spectroscopy\-based technique which has proven to be invaluable as an accurate and quantitative method. The work carried out by his department is recognised throughout the global dried herb and spice sector as having enabled there to be a step change in supply chain controls and acted as a deterrent to the perpetrators of adulteration.”* **\[5.3\]** 

 Altuntas Baharat, a major Turkish supplier of herbs also confirmed: 

 “*Following on from the ground breaking research by Queen’s University Belfast and specifically the Institute for Global Food Security to develop definitive methods of analysis to identify adulterants in oregano and sage we have seen a step change in our industry and a growth in our business…Your research has had a truly global reach and we have seen benefits in markets as diverse as Japan, USA, Australia and of course Europe.”* **\[5.6\]** 

 The food fingerprinting approach developed by Professor Elliott, Dr Haughey and team has consequently, not only been instrumental in the detection of international food fraud, but has benefited suppliers nationally and internationally and helped restore consumer confidence in the industry. 

 After publication of the WHICH? survey results **\[5.5\],** upwards of fifty of the major UK and Irish food manufacturers and retailers began a large scale programme of testing raw materials and finished products, throughout their supply chains, using the new test developed at QUB.  One retailer \(Sainsbury’s\) went so far as to declare an amnesty for any supplier found to be the victim of food fraud **\[5.7\].**  In 2018, six of the UK’s largest retailers offered an amnesty to their suppliers in terms of using adulterated herbs and spices.  They were instructed to send samples to QUB for testing.  This exercise was undertaken and many issues were uncovered and dealt with under secrecy agreements with suppliers **\[5.7\].**  In 2020, the world’s largest herb and spice company, McCormick’s \(relevant products sold under Schwartz brand in UK\) instructed their entire supply base to have their products tested for authenticity at QUB under Prof Elliott’s supervision **\[5.8\]**.  The same adulteration issue was found to exist in multiple markets for example in Australia and Norway, which resulted in the prosecution of Spencers foods based in Australia **\[5.9\].** 

 As a consequence of this research the QUB Asset Technology Centre became the world’s first accredited laboratory for the detection of herb and spice adulteration using a non\-targeted molecular spectroscopy method \(UKAS ISO 17025\) **\[5.10\]**.  The team were also recently given the status of UK Centre for expertise in food authenticity by the UK government, the only university to hold this status. This research also resulted in the formation of a QUB spin\-out company, Cibus \(recently re\-named to Bia analytical, but referred to as Cibus throughout this document to avoid confusion\), which is dedicated to the testing of herbs and spices globally.  It was set up with a grant \(GBP210,000\) from Innovate UK, with substantial further investment \(\~GBP400,000\) secured from business angels in partnership with a FTSE100 listed company \(Halma\). The company created 4 full time highly skilled posts at start up **\[5.11\]**.  The success of Professor Elliott and his team has also resulted in IGFS being awarded the status of ‘An International Atomic Energy Agency Collaborating Centre’ in December 2020.  The award was made based on  scientific excellence and support given to IAEA in the fields of food safety, authenticity and traceability.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Based on his Essex research, Papadopoulos developed a unique approach \(termed **Synergic Therapeutic Complexity\- STC\)** to working with Involuntary Dislocated \(ID\) persons \(from political violence, disasters or marginalisation\), which enables a collaborative and empowering engagement between beneficiaries and caregivers. This research and its application through  extensive engagement with governments and organisations that work with ID persons, has led to improved integration of refugees in host countries, influenced government policies, defined best practice for the United Nations \(UN\), and directly changed working practices of organisations and professional bodies. His unique methodological approach has been adopted by 19 organisations in 12 countries throughout the world, from Greece to countries of the Pacific Rim, Costa Rica, Mexico, USA and the UK, benefitting over 67,700 refugees and ID persons.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research \[R1\-R8\] consists of publications forming a comprehensive and innovative **framework** \(the Synergic Therapeutic Complexity approach, STC\), which has been key to informing all of Professor Papadopoulos’ impact activities. In 2019 a formal Training Manual of STC was published in English, Greek and Spanish \[R6\]. 

 Exposure to adversity creates multiple pressures including those arising from the emotional nature of the situations and those concerning the servicing of pressing needs. These impede the *processing* of the experiences, leading to oversimplification and polarisation of the perception of all the relevant phenomena, their causes and consequences. Papadopoulos’ unique STC approach emphasises the need for *epistemological* astuteness to discern all the relevant phenomena with the least possible distortions. Specifically, it differentiates between *events* and the *experience* of the events, and between being a *victim* of circumstances and developing a *victim identity*. 

 The term *Involuntary Dislocation* \(ID\) is used to grasp the key experiences in these contexts \(including migrants and refugees\).  The concept and image of *home* is central in ID. It is defined by the research as the interactional systemic hub of *time*, *space* and *relationships* \( *space* is not limited to geographical space but also incorporates cultural, linguistic and spiritual conceptions; and *relationships* also with objects, ideas, narratives, etc.\). People do not have one *home* but multiple *homes*, each one being context related. The *dimension* of ‘ *homeness’* refers to the degree of strength of the sense of *home*. 

 *Identity* is formulated in the research as the unique fit between two sets of elements: those that are *intentionally* *perceptible* \(e.g. age, gender, attitudes\) and those clusters that constitute the *mosaic substrate* of identity, i.e. those elements that are taken for granted and not considered as relevant \(e.g. sense perceptions, routines, rituals\). The unique fit between the two sets creates the dynamic sense of the relationship between the totality of oneself and the totality of one’s perceptible environment \( *Umwelt*\), which Papadopoulos influentially conceptualises as *onto\-ecological settledness.* This produces the sense of familiarity and predictability. During ID, *onto\-ecological settledness* becomes destabilised, producing a unique sense of discomfort and disorientation, which he terms *nostalgic disorientation \(ND\)*. Papadopoulos’ research identifies a crucial distinction between ND and usual psychological and psychiatric trauma. 

 Developed as a means to mobilise these concepts into more practice\-oriented settings, the  *Adversity Grid* is a framework that enables us to appreciate the range of responses to adversity, categorised as: \(a\) negative responses \(suffering, disorientation, etc.\) and \(b\) positive developments that were activated by the very exposure to adversity \( *Adversity\-Activated Development \-\- AAD*\), whilst also accommodating \(c\) affected persons’ existing strengths \( *resilience*\) retained from before their exposure to adversity. Moreover, the Grid differentiates between three degrees of severity within the negative effects \(i\) psychiatric disorders, \(ii\) distressful psychological symptoms and \(iii\) ‘Ordinary Human Suffering’. This research\-informed Adversity Grid enables workers to counteract oversimplification and polarisation in their responses, while avoiding ‘confusing complexity’ by promoting ‘discerning complexity’, ultimately empowering their beneficiaries by activating their retained and new strengths, in a therapeutic way. Use of this framework has been shown to reduce caregivers’ burnout because \(a\) they are not burdened by the pressures of repairing their ‘damaged’ beneficiaries but \(b\) they appreciate the beneficiaries’ resilience and AAD as well as the resilience and AAD of their own.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Refugees, migrants and those who involuntarily have to abandon the spaces they consider their homes are exposed to various forms of adversity that affect them in many ways. Papadopoulos’ research \[R1\-R8\] has developed a clear conceptualisation of the relevant phenomena, responses and processes that arise from adversity so that the resulting consequences can be effectively addressed, bringing clarity to a highly contested field of political debate. Papadopoulos’ research has developed and refined the framework of STC \[R6\]. Through collaboration with governments and organisations that work directly with ID persons, professional standards have changed, and organisations have adopted his approach. By providing a comprehensive framework which appropriately conceptualises the consequences of adversity, STC has altered the overall *policy orientation* of the organisations, and their thinking and practices *.* 

 <ins> **Defining global best practice**</ins> 

 Responding to the dramatic increase of refugees and asylum seekers travelling to Europe the British Psychological Society \(BPS\) published guidance for psychologists working with ID persons in 2018 \[S1\]. This draws specifically on Papadopoulos’ conceptualisation of STC within its assessments and interventions, serving as a practical means to ensure professionals working with these vulnerable populations improve the lives of individuals and communities that have been affected by such crises. Promoted for use in the UK and abroad it is used by frontline psychologists, those working in the field, and practitioners in related disciplines \[S1\]. For nearly two decades the UN International Organization for Migration \(IOM\), the leading body providing mental health and psychosocial support to migrants and host communities, have used an adaptation of Papadopoulos’ formulation of STC as a dedicated model for their community based approach to Mental Health and Psychosocial Support \(MHPSS\) \[S2\]. Papadopoulos continues to advise the IOM and was on the Steering Committee of its Global Mental Health, Psychosocial Response and Intercultural Communication section between 2017 and 2019 \[S2\]. His research \[R1\-8\] is the dominant concept and model that forms the basis of the IOM MHPSS manual published in 2019, guiding programmes dedicated to improving the availability and quality of psychosocial support in the practical implementation of their activities with a community\-based approach in over 45 countries worldwide. \[S2\] 

 <ins> **Changing international policy**</ins> 

 Papadopoulos’ research \[R1\-R8\] led to direct changes in policy at the Hellenic Ministry of Health which deals with Greece’s psychosocial response to emergencies and crises. Between February 2016 and July 2017, he was on the official Task Force of 19 Mental Health professionals advising the Permanent Secretary on the psychosocial dimensions and response to mass adversities such as the ‘refugee crisis’. The Task Force’s final report was adopted by the Ministry of Health and informed all activities in this area. The then Permanent Secretary states: *‘Papadopoulos’ invaluable and unique contribution, based on his specific approach of ‘STC’, consisted in his essential contribution to the provision of the framework of the report, according to which the predicament of the affected groups of people was not pathologized but understood in terms of its complexity. Including not only the negative effects of adversity…but also their strengths \(old and new\) …his ‘Adversity grid’ occupied a central position in the…policy.’* \[S3\] 

 <ins> **Changing practices**</ins> 

 Working with organisations in Europe, South America, North America, Asia and Australasia Papadopoulos has improved the way that ID persons and those who experience trauma are treated. By offering a cluster of research\-informed supervisions, consultations, training and evaluation services Papadopoulos has introduced STC to practitioners who have adopted and embedded his research in their professional practices, including in: 

 **Greece:** Babel Day Centre, a public mental health unit, financed by the Greek Ministry of Health, supporting immigrants and refugees nationwide, has collaborated with Papadopoulos since 2013. Papadopoulos delivers face to face supervisions, consultations and offers virtual support to over 110 practitioners and volunteers yearly. Papadopoulos’ theoretical approach is central to Babel’s philosophy and practice \[S4\]. Data from practitioners in Greece \(2018\) estimate that over 6,000 ID persons benefitted from the STC approach \[S4a\]. The director of Babel states: *‘… when the refugee crisis expanded, and more than 1,000,000 people came to Greece from Turkey… Papadopoulos’ contribution to the management of the crisis… was crucial… Babel staff started visiting the islands and camps all over Greece, separately or in the framework of different projects, to deliver training and supervision to people at the front line, based on Papadopoulos’ approach…Papadopoulos’ work has been decisive on the way Babel operates. The therapeutic approach we follow \(and train others to follow\) is based on Papadopoulos’ ‘adversity grid’.* \[S4a\] 

 **Korea, Japan, Australia, the Philippines, Canada, Mexico, and USA:** In 2018 Papadopoulos introduced STC to professionals working therapeutically with adversity survivors in American and Asian humanitarian organisations in the fields of nursing, psychology, social work, family therapy, chaplaincy, midwifery and medicine. Building on \[R1\-R8\] Papadopoulos developed a specific programme for caregivers along with newly developed instruments for the assessment of adversity survivors that has been instituted into practice. Papadopoulos trained 50 key leaders in the mental health professions to serve as regional trainers in STC for other members of their community. Since 2018 these trainers trained over 2,000 others, enabling his framework to help an estimated 25,000 adversity survivors in the countries of the Pacific Rim. The key leaders included professionals from Hiroshima City Hospital, American Red Cross, Canadian Red Cross, John Hopkins University School of Nursing, Antiochian House of Studies, United States Coast Guard, United States Navy, Project Mexico, United States Forest Service, and Boise State University Health Services \[S5\]. Therapeutic practices were amended following the project and testimonials show how STC was adopted. The American Red Cross state: *""These trainings were unlike any educational opportunities in the field that our members have had before, as they undergirded our policies and techniques with a strong philosophical foundation. Since the training our members continue to discuss its impact, and the primary principles that we now share, and it has become a part of the way we see our work.""* \[S5\] 

 <ins> **Enabling more effective integration of refugees into host countries</ins>** 

 Through ongoing collaboration with NGOs, Refugee Councils and Asylum Services Papadopoulos’ research has led to improved integration of refugees into their host communities: 

 **Greece:** In October 2014 Papadopoulos worked with the Greek Council for Refugees, Babel Day Centre and Médecins sans Frontiers to establish ‘Prometheus II’ \[G1\], to support migrants and refugees who have been subjected to violence \[S6\]. By establishing a team of experts dealing with medical, mental health, legal and social work matters alongside interpreters, this holistic approach, based on \[R1\-R8\], allowed the early identification of vulnerable asylum seekers who had been victims of torture, enabling more effective treatment. In 2017 the project was recognised for its best practice by the European Council on Refugees and Exiles \[S6a\]. The Prometheus Project Director states: “\[following STC\] *…we conceptualise things differently and we work differently…Of particular importance is what we learned about how to work with people who have experiences of torture…An important component of this project is provision of training to other professionals all over Greece on how to approach Survivors of Torture using Papadopoulos' theoretical framework*.”\[S4a\]. From 2017\-2019 Papadopoulos introduced STC to the Greek Asylum Service training interviewing officers, social workers and lawyers who support asylum seekers throughout the process. STC was subsequently adopted across the service. The Asylum Service of the Hellenic Republic confirm: *”\[Papadopoulos’\] contribution was invaluable because it changed the style and approach of the Asylum Service, making it more sensitive to the psychosocial complexities of the asylum seekers and, thus, improving substantially the very asylum process”.* \[S7\]. Since 2015 Papadopoulos has worked directly with the NGO Lesvos Solidarity who support the most vulnerable refugees and survivors of shipwrecks housed in the PIKPA informal camp. The Chair of Lesvos Solidarity states: *”Papadopoulos contributed decisively to the formation of our organisations policy and modus operandi in our work with refugees…our operational style changed dramatically as we became aware of the need to bear in mind the whole spectrum of consequences when people are exposed to adversities, to avoid victimisation, to promote resilience and adversity activated development.”* \[S8\] 

 **Costa Rica:** In 2018 Papadopoulos introduced STC to a consortium assigned by the government to address the increasing numbers of refugees and migrants in Costa Rica. The Jesuit Migration Service \(JMS\) adopted his framework to promote self\-reliance, self\-worth and autonomy among asylum seekers, refugees and migrants. Since 2018 approximately 700 people have benefitted from this approach across San Jose and the remote communities in northern Costa Rica. The JMS state: *""...\[STC\] has opened a new perspective on how our organization can conduct more comprehensive and dignified interventions with asylum seekers, refugees and migrants, by going beyond assessing vulnerability and victimisation, to identifying the retain\[ed\] strengths and resilience, as well as the new strengths these persons developed as a result of their displacement adversities...This approach has become fundamental to JMS\-CR's daily work.""* \[S9\] 

 <ins> **Responding to Covid\-19**</ins> 

 Papadopoulos has worked with organisations to address psychosocial issues relating to the pandemic, including: 

 **International Orthodox Christian Charities \(IOCC\), USA:** This international NGO approached Papadopoulos to train staff in the principles of STC \[R1\-R8\]. Papadopoulos has collaborated with the IOCC since the Covid\-19 outbreak developing specific resources based on his unique approach for the Frontliners, a highly trained crisis response team and experienced Orthodox clergy providing emotional and spiritual care in emergency situations. The Executive Director states that adopting Papadopoulos’ framework has led to: *”an increase in awareness and practice of the emotional and spiritual care under chronic situations like pandemics.”* \[S10\] 

 **National Health Service \(NHS\), UK:** The Covid\-19 pandemic has put health care professionals under extreme pressure, the impact on the mental health and wellbeing of NHS workers must not be underestimated. Papadopoulos introduced STC to four NHS trusts \(East London, Central & Northwest London, Devon Partnerships and Norfolk & Suffolk NHS Foundation Trusts\) through online seminars in Summer 2020. The framework continues to be used by practitioners as the East London NHS Foundation Trust confirm regarding their large scale covid\-19 staff impact study: “ *The key aspect…is the concept of “Adversity Activated Development”, developed by Papadopoulos; the longitudinal study is unique and explores for the first time a range of responses to the pandemic among front line health care staff … including clinicians from mental health, primary care, and community health care organisations…The results of the study will inform NHS trusts in their staff safety and wellbeing programmes, establish risk as well as significant protective factors across staff on the basis of the reflective adversity grid tool...*”\[S11\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at the University of Lincoln International Business School focused on developing the capability of hard\-to\-reach community organisations, which typically lack political or economic power, to enable them to engage with democratic processes that improve their situation and their future.  Strategically, the researchers reached such communities by fostering new forms of partnerships between universities and third sector organisations. Their research developed an organising framework \(CDF\) based on organisational systems and learning theories, which has been used to strengthen third sector management and public sector partnerships. The impact in six international partnerships and one UK partnership are described. These have informed national policies, changed the community engagement structures of universities and built university/third sector partnerships that have successfully engaged with thousands of people enabling their communities to be actively engaged in the democratic processes of social change. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The programme of research undertaken at the University of Lincoln was founded on initial studies on organisational systems theory and operations management. This was applied to communities, civil society and third sector management. During this research Mendiwelso\-Bendek and her team demonstrated that the dynamics of self\-constructed learning spaces are important for effective community organisation and innovation. In addition, it elaborated the central significance of action in the organisation and structuring of citizenship learning, taking account of the circularity between observation and reflection with conversations shaping knowledge, practice and theory\-in\-use **\[3.1** and **3.2\]**. 

 Research \(2003\-2011\) funded by the Home Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government used a network of local programmes to engage with communities to address aspects of public policy and management. This identified that “active learning for active citizenship requires SPACE \(Social and Political Active Citizenship Education\) for sustainability”. The research also identified the critical need to understand power relations in the ‘space’ of active citizenship and provided a framework for organisational systems to be developed and linked to wider policy issues **\[3.2\]**. 

 A further phase of the research \(2008\-2013\) was via ‘Take Part’, an ESRC Capacity Building research project, led by the University of Lincoln \(with Manchester and Goldsmiths London universities\). From this a better understanding of systemic organisation of community\-university relationships \(for citizenship learning\) was gained, thus contributing to partnership management by universities **\[3.3\].** The findings showed how research\-based evidence contributes to community development and community organisation, when owned by those third sector communities. The approach strengthens capacity, enabling communities to address current challenges and so promotes active citizenship agendas. A **Community Development Framework** **\(CDF\)** was the main published output, explaining the evidence, concepts and approaches, along with guidance, training for trainers and tools to strengthen university and community partnerships. **\[3.4,** p237\-8 **\].** 

 Since 2013, the research has been extended geographically to promote, develop and study the approaches to community\-based research \(CBR\) used to influence the democratic social transformation process in different cultural contexts **\[3.3\].** For example, in Colombia the challenge of the post conflict situation was identified as an area where community organisation and development through community\-based research in university and community partnerships could help develop the CDF contextually and create impact. At the same time the UK based action research was extended to new UK communities and widened into Europe through research partnerships. In 2015 Mendiwelso\-Bendek led a European partnership submitting a Horizon 2020 proposal to use, and develop, the CDF in the context of lifelong learning, with the aim of creating potential models of inclusive approaches and organisation. The network which developed as a result of this bid enabled researchers from Lincoln to work on three separate action research programmes in Italy, Spain and Slovenia. Each of these enabled the CDF to be extended contextually to third sector organisation\-university partnerships. 

 This research has contributed new knowledge to understand and improve the management of genuine university\-community co\-operation in action research that benefits all participants. The objective of such partnerships is to discover, design and develop ways to enable active citizenship and democratic social transformation, especially for less advantaged communities.  To this end the approach is action\-oriented, collaborative and participative. Genuine collaboration in all aspects of the process leads to greater ownership by communities, improved skills and knowledge and greater motivation to engage **\[3.3, 3.6\].**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The main impact goal of the research is to develop the capability of communities that typically lack political or economic power to engage with democratic processes and improve their situation and their future. Through the Community Development Framework \(CDF\) **,** community development was co\-produced through collaborative action research in the field \(aforementioned CBR\), revealing contextual and institutional landscapes; for instance, power, rights and obligations; and developing practices in that context. The inherent involvement of communities in the process led to greater understanding, and more importantly, greater ownership of the knowledge produced, greater sense of agency to be able to create change and thus a greater commitment to action as a result. 

 Much of the impact thus arises through the engagement of intermediary organisations, such community groups and university partnerships, primarily via “Take Part”.  In Take Part projects, the intermediaries use collaborative research and learning frameworks to develop their capacity to work with \(rather than for\) their own communities. Thus, the impact described below reports the changes in approach by these important intermediaries, showing how it has influenced their activities and benefit to their communities. Between 2013\-2020 the Take Part Research Programme has been active in the UK but has expanded through partnerships in Europe, Latin America, and the USA. 

 A recent **UK** example is the ‘Social Issues in South Lincs’, programme. This uses the Take Part CDF to create a community\-based process to identify emerging research data on social needs and local responses. The CDF supports the systemic design, implementation and mentoring of a stakeholder network dealing with aging populations, rural isolation and infrastructure, social cohesion and migration, mental health and economic/social sustainability.  The CDF has generated the network’s ability to link emergency responses and service delivery \(e.g. NHS\) to local community providers of the needed resources **\[5.1\]**. For example, the network was able to react more effectively to the COVID crisis and develop community\-led responses. This has resulted in over 900 families being fed and led to NHS professionals being able to easily identify and use local resources for Social Prescribing and emergency planning. In addition to this the network contributes to public policy, such the Parliamentary Inquiry on Rural Health and Social Care in 2018 and ‘Holistic Mission: Social action and the Church of England’ \- which was debated in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The impact of this was to “ *raise awareness of the lived\-realities and social needs in rural communities*” **\[5.1\].** 

 **In Europe**, Take Part has been used effectively to improve the community engagement of some universities active in community research, as well as having a resulting positive impact on their communities.  Between 2015\-2017 the University of Maribor \(Slovenia\) used the Take Part CDF to create a multi\-layered monitoring and evaluation model, established the use of participative approaches in Summer School active projects for 60 students, improved its \(Maribor’s\) understanding of active citizenship and was able to align activities with civil society organisations, providing a deeper learning experience for all **\[5.2** letter and p6 in report **\].** 

 At the University of Sassari \( **Italy**\), the Research and Teaching Laboratory on Social Policies and Training \(FOIST\), adopted the Take Part CDF approach in designing its support programmes with third sector organisations. This led to the lab developing its own CDF from the collaboration with Lincoln and ultimately changing the structure of its engagement with third sector organisations. The “ *indispensable*” Take Part approach has been a key factor in enabling them to engage strategically in higher level policy making \(they refer to “scalability”\) with regards to social policy. For example, facilitating community/municipality policy dialogue and on community health programmes **\[5.3\].** 

 The Universidad Internacional Menéndez Pelayo \(UIMP\) and CeiMigra \- Jesuits Service of Immigrants in Valencia \( **Spain**\) and a group of significant third sector organisations \(such as Islamic Communities, Save the Children and Amnesty International\), worked with Lincoln to create a systemic based research process informed by the CDF. This was subsequently adopted in the practices and strategic thinking of regional policy on immigration **\[5.4** p199\-210 **\].** The focus was collaboration to address migration and integration through cooperative practices and CBR approaches. The partnership supported third sector organisations to engage more closely with migrant communities, to improve the integration of immigrants and to enable them to become active in work, education and health. The collaboration between UIMP and Lincoln continues, strengthening the work of the Valencian Immigration Observatory in support of third sector organisations working with migrants **\[5.5\]** 

 **Latin America:** The Lincoln research drew interest from universities in **Colombia** where communities face life\-threatening challenges in the post conflict era and need to develop political and economic power to implement the national Peace Agreement. Through the University of Ibagué / Lincoln CDF **,** Ibagué estimate that more than 200 community leaders, students and researchers have participated in Take Part. This has led to individuals working with local authorities in the 47 rural municipalities of the Tolima region to help them engage more effectively through CBR **\[5.6\]**. 

 In 2017 the University of Los Andes Co\-Lab Paz \(Peace\) for Community Based Research collaborated with Lincoln to develop its own CDF. This has been used with over 1,000 people from different ethic and community backgrounds in the Magdalena Medio, Cauca and Sur de Bolívar regions of **Colombia** to help reduce post\-conflict tensions and enable them to contribute to meaningful future plans **.** In the region of Huila the CDF has also been used with rural educational communities to develop neighbourhood dialogues. This has involved more than 1,500 youth leaders who have contributed to the municipalities’ development plans. **\[5.7, 5.8** p1 and 18\-20 **\]**. In addition, the Take Part CDF has influenced policy on citizen empowerment in the Capital District of Bogotá and contributed to the Colombian Government’s social research policy to increase the impact of social research for communities. This is elaborated in the Colombian Framework for Community Based Research **\[5.8\]** which is an important input for Colombia´s national development plan for the next two decades **\[5.7\]**. 

 **Further International reach and significance:** In 2017 a partnership between Lincoln and the Mortenson Center for International Library Programs, University of Illinois \( **USA**\), co\-created a new experiential learning programme based on the Take Part CDF – The Community\-Library Inter\-Action **\(CLIA\)** programme. CLIA report that “ *library services have been reimagined*” **\[5.9\]** with a transformation from the previous emphasis on library services *for* communities, to librarians and community workers focused on library programmes *with* communities **\[5.9\]**. 800 librarians and community leaders have participated in the USA, Canada, Colombia, India, Spain, Qatar, Peru, Costa Rica, Argentina, South Africa, and Uganda.  The Director of the Mortenson Centre reported that in Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru 300 participants had supported community\-designed development across 28 projects **\[5.9, 5.10\]** which had benefited over 2,000 citizens including “parents and neighbours, caregivers of disabled youth, indigenous youth, members of youth groups and boy scout groups” **\[5.9\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Paul Webb’s research on British political party members has substantially informed and contributed to the parties’ own understanding of their memberships, and media coverage of party politics. The primary evidence that it has boosted the beneficiaries’ \(i.e. parties’ and the media’s\) awareness and understanding of this subject lies in: \(1\) the frequency with which the research has been used by media for their output, and \(2\) the attention it has gained from the parties themselves, in the form of invited presentations to party conferences and professional staff, and further commissioned research designed to shape their political strategies. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The ESRC\-funded Party Members Project \(PMP\) is the most extensive study of British party members ever undertaken. The project commissioned YouGov to survey members of 6 parties after the 2015, 2017 and 2019 election campaigns; Labour members in 2016; Labour\-affiliated trade union members in 2015; and partisan identifiers in that same year. PMP also surveyed Conservative and Labour members on Brexit in December 2018, and Conservative members on the leadership election in May 2019. In addition, several dozen interviews with party officials and politicians were conducted. The quantitative analysis, which was central to this project, was led and conducted by Webb, as Co\-I. This body of work builds on previous research on Conservative Party members conducted by Webb and Bale in 2013\-14. 

 Key findings relate to: the identity of members \(and non\-member supporters\) in terms of demographic and attitudinal profiles; why they join parties; what they do for their parties in election campaigns; why Labour’s membership surged so dramatically after the 2015 general election; what members think about party leaders, intra\-party procedures and relationships; and why some eventually leave parties. Of particular note are the following findings: 

1.  Non\-member supporters do as much campaign work as members in total, but members remain more important for high\-intensity activities such as canvassing \[R1\]; 

1.  the well\-known ‘General Incentives Model’ of party membership, first developed and tested in the early 1990s, still broadly holds today \[R2\], but factors specific to local constituency and party contexts also contribute significantly to understanding the campaign activity of members, especially in respect of traditional ‘offline’ as opposed to ‘online’ activity \[R3\]; 

1.  the most ‘intensive’ forms of membership activity depend in significant part on those members who either seek a career in politics or are embedded in social networks based around their local parties \[R4\]; 

1.  Labour’s membership surge after 2015 was driven in part by the society’s ‘educated left\-behinds’ \(ie, economically insecure graduates – \[R5\]\); 

1.  when members leave political parties, it is usually over perceptions of ideological distance from, and disillusionment with, the leadership \[R6\]; and 

1.  Conservative members increasingly came to favour ‘Hard Brexit’ after 2015, while Labour’s membership overwhelmingly disapproved of Brexit, the UK’s departure from the Single European Market and EU Customs Union, even though the party leadership initially embraced all of these positions in 2017 \[R6\]. 

 Webb has been fully involved with the design of the project and surveys as an equal partner and has taken primary responsibility for quantitative analysis of data. He was lead\-author on R1\-R4, and co\-author of the monograph \[R6\]. Thus, his contribution has been central to material that has been disseminated to the media and parties – even when he has not been the team member directly engaging with media. After the initial funding period ended, ESRC awarded additional funding that enabled the PMP team to run further surveys following the 2019 general election.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Political parties are an integral component of the UK system of representative democracy. It is therefore no surprise that the parties, the media and politically\-engaged citizens seek accurate and detailed information about who the members are, why they join and leave parties, what they think, and what they do for the parties. This research has provided the contemporary baseline for public knowledge and debate about the demographics, attitudes and activities of party members in Britain today: figures from the project have become ‘the facts’ used by the media and by politicians themselves, as well as by other researchers, academic and non\-academic. 

 The significance of the PMP’s impact can be demonstrated by reference to two direct beneficiary groups: \(1\) political journalists, who have reported the findings directly, using them to inform their own political analysis, and who have commissioned work by the researchers; and \(2\) political parties, whose staff have sought to understand the findings and apply them to their membership and electoral strategies. Each of these is a conduit to broader public awareness. The reach of PMP’s impact can be demonstrated by: \(1\) the very large readerships and viewerships of the media sources \(including social media\) exploiting the project findings, and \(2\) the leading party politicians and national officers who acknowledge the impact of the research. 

 **Impact on journalists’ and their audiences’ understanding** 

 Impact has been achieved through media engagement, including articles written for *The Times, The Observer, The Independent, The Daily Telegraph, The Financial Times, The New Statesman, The Huffington Post, The Monkey Cage, Prospect* and *Political Insight* magazines, and various blogs. Since the project’s inception, the team has authored 47 published articles \(of which Webb has been co\-author 22 times\), and at least 60 articles referencing PMP findings have been published in a wide range of national and overseas media outlets. The PMP team have made more than 20 broadcast media appearances on BBC News, Sky News, Radio 4, LBC and the BBC Parliament Channel, including an episode of BBC Parliament Channel’s *Booktalk* dedicated to the *Footsoldiers* book \[R6\]. All of these contributions \[outlined in S1\] have depended heavily on Webb’s quantitative research. 

 Webb’s research has enhanced the media’s understanding, analysis and reporting of this topic. The research has provided evidence about the demographic and attitudinal profiles of party memberships, the relationships between leaders and members, and the reasons behind phenomena such as the huge surge in Labour Party membership after 2015. The media have used Webb’s findings to inform their coverage of party leadership contests \(Labour in 2015, 2016 and 2020, Conservatives in 2016 and 2019, Liberal Democrats in 2019\), and the debate about Brexit. This impact is not limited to the UK media: see, for instance, Luke McGee’s piece for CNN on the Tory leadership contest of 2019, or Yasmeen Serhan’s piece for *The Atlantic* about the same contest, both of which draw heavily on and directly cite *Footsoldiers* \[R6\] \[S1\]. 

 Some examples illustrate the significance of Webb’s contribution via PMP to the media debate: In his *Guardian* article \(16 September 2017\), Nick Cohen draws on PMP findings to argue that the surge in Labour membership has been driven in part by the frustrations and resentments of a ‘left\-behind middle class’, which is very closely connected with PMP’s concept of the ‘educated left\-behinds’ \[R5\]. In a *Guardian* article \(27 July 2016\), Owen Jones cites Webb’s research on Labour’s electorate, to show that it is ‘unrepresentative of the population’, because middle\-class professionals make up half of Labour Party members. He urges Labour leaders to adopt a strategy to ‘recruit and give leadership positions to underrepresented working\-class people, particularly in the north’. This may or may not be sound advice, but it is unlikely this analysis would have come about without PMP’s research findings on Labour’s grassroots. 

 In a notable contribution, PMP ran the first survey after the 2017 General Election that revealed how Labour Party members were overwhelmingly against Brexit, and in favour of the UK remaining in the Single European Market and Customs Union. *The Guardian’s* Anushka Asthana \(17 July 2017\) reported this finding and it was immediately re\-Tweeted by the then\-leading Labour anti\-Brexiteer, Chuka Umunna, among others – thus informing and shaping the debate about Brexit both within parties and beyond. In December 2018, PMP ran a detailed survey of the attitudes of Conservative and Labour members on Brexit \[R6\]. The research was able to demonstrate that positions on Brexit distinguished the two parties’ membership far more starkly than their positions on any other issues. These findings were widely reported across numerous media outlets during \(and after\) January 2019, ranging from *The Guardian* to *The Mirror*, and the broadcast media. Several items at the time of the Conservative leadership election of 2019 made heavy use of Webb’s PMP research. 

 In *The Guardian* \(21 June 2019\), Pegge & Duncan’s account of the demographic and attitudinal profile of the Tory members who would elect the new Prime Minister drew heavily and directly on Webb’s research, as did Paul Waugh’s detailed article in *The Financial Times* \(22 June 2019\). Similarly, Chuka Ummuna’s critical analysis of Boris Johnson’s candidacy \( *The Independent*, 24 June 2019\) made use of Webb’s research regarding the Tory membership. In January 2020, PMP released details of the first survey of Labour members about their views of candidates in the then\-forthcoming leadership contest, which received heavy coverage \(especially Sky News *The Guardian* and *The New Statesman*\), including overseas. Moreover, the survey is considered to have impacted on the betting market, with odds on Starmer \(the leader in PMP’s poll\) to win reducing radically in his favour after the research was reported \[S7\]. Similarly, PMP produced the first poll pertaining to the Liberal Democrat leadership contest in 2020, which was quickly picked up by the *New Statesman.* 

 Statements from 11 national journalists \[S2\] emphatically attest to the significance of PMP research for their work. For example, Stephen Bush of *The New Statesman* says ‘…the Project has provided us with all sorts of valuable insights into an area of political life in this country that previously we’d only really been able to make guesses about.  As a result, we’ve been able to tell our audience much more about what people at the grassroots think and do, and that’s made a valuable contribution to our coverage of big issues like Brexit, of elections, and leadership contests’ \[S2.1\]. Zoe Williams of *The Guardian* confirms she ‘use\[s\] the data constantly, not just because I know it to be robust and reliable in support of arguments but as a kicking\-off point’ \[S2.2\]. Kishan Koria of ITV’s *Peston* says ‘Work conducted by the Project has helped us produce graphics for agenda\-setting items with findings often put directly to the decision makers who appear on the programme. Their work has really helped our audience \(which during recent times of high political interest has often been 0.7\-1m people\) understand what's been going on during a particularly turbulent time for British politics’ \[S2.3\]. Matt Chorley of *The Times* says ‘The Party Members’ Project is a brilliant resource, which provides a rich stream of properly researched insight into who grassroots members are, their priorities and values. This has been especially useful during the many leadership elections we have had in recent years, helping our readers and listeners to develop a deeper understanding of these contests, and their likely outcomes’ \[S2.4\]. Sam Coates of *Sky News* says, ‘It’s a unique project that has a clear public interest, clear impact, betters understanding of key areas and is very simple for large numbers of people to understand and benefit from, via our reporting of it’ \[S2.5\]. 

 The extensive media coverage of the research – given the size of the reader and viewer audiences involved \[S1\] – has enabled PMP’s research to inform readers on an extensive scale. For example, Nick Cohen’s *Guardian* article attracted 4659 Facebook downloads and 856 comments. An article citing PMP work in the *Independent* by Ashley Cowburn \(8 September 2017\) was shared 739 times on social media, attracting 439 comments. Anushka Asthana’s *Guardian* article was shared 8259 times, attracting 1386 comments; she cited the evidence again in a subsequent article \(24 July 2017\) which was shared 938 times and attracted 4236 comments – and then was cited again by Polly Toynbee \(25 July 2017\), shared 3961 times on Facebook, attracting 2565 comments. An article written by the PMP team for the BBC Website in May 2019 attracted more than 1.1 million views \[see Tom Edgington statement, S2.11\]. 

 Analysis of social media responses to the project \[S3\] shows that the PMP has reached a wide and engaged audience on Twitter and Facebook. On Facebook, the number of PMP article shares steadily increased to nearly 20,000 over the course of the project, with the number of comments and reactions increasing to over 60,000 for each measure, which demonstrates that users are engaging with the material \[S3, Figure 1\]. The analysis set out in S3 also shows that the average reach of journalists tweeting PMP work is 175,001, and calculates that PMP\-related articles have appeared on Twitter users’ feeds over 8.5 million times in 2019\-2020 alone. 

 **Impact on political parties’ strategies and parliamentary processes** 

 Political parties have used Webb’s PMP research to inform their understanding, policy and practice. This was deliberately facilitated through a number of activities and presentations to the parties, and one substantial non\-technical report that summarised many of the key findings for distribution to all MPs \(as well as major media outlets\) –  [*Grassroots*](https://esrcpartymembersprojectorg.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/grassroots-pmp_final.pdf) \(2018\). The team has disseminated key findings to Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and the Green Party of England & Wales \(GPEW\) in face\-to\-face briefings and presentations to head office professionals. In addition, presentations have been delivered to the annual conferences of the Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Green parties and UKIP, to the London Liberal Democrats’ annual conference, and to public events organised by the Electoral Reform Society, and the Social Market Foundation. Webb featured prominently in all but two of these party presentations \(the Conservative and UKIP conferences\). In all, the team has undertaken more than a dozen direct engagements with political parties to inform them of its research. 

 Corroborating statements and evidence pertaining to these activities are collated in \[S4\]. These include evidence from Iain McNicol, Labour’s General Secretary from 2011\-18 \[S4.1\]: ‘The qualitative and quantitative analysis the team set out contributed to our HQ’s understanding of members’ preferences and priorities’; Anita Boateng, special advisor to the Conservative Party Chair \[S4.2\]: PMP ‘proved a really useful additional contribution to our understanding of our members and potential members, and helped inform our strategy going forward’; and Mark Pack, President of the Liberal Democrats \[S4.3\]: ‘The Party Members Project is an invaluable source of insight into party membership, providing information that goes well beyond the internal data held by the Liberal Democrats… It has repeatedly influenced decisions we have taken about our approach to recruiting and mobilising members’. Pack also published a review of *Footsoldiers* in which he asserted the importance of its messages about membership recruitment and mobilization. Liberal Democrat Federal Board member William Dyer published an article in the Liberal Democrat National Newsletter to members citing PMP research findings, following a presentation by Webb to Liberal Democrat headquarters staff on 20 March 2019 \[S4.4\]. 

 Crucially, Labour peer Baroness Hayter pointed out the impact of PMP research on the party’s leadership contest in 2020 \[S4.5\]: ‘The New year poll of Labour members showing Keir Starmer as first choice for Leader did two things. It showed MPs making nominations that their first choice resounded with members. And it completely energised Starmer’s potential supporters who realised they could win, and that the hard work to come was likely to pay off. A pivotal point in the subsequent election.’ As noted above, the effects of these findings were also reflected in the betting market \[S7\]. 

 A presentation made by Webb to Green Party staff in January 2018 led directly to the party commissioning Webb and Bale to undertake further research on political strategy \(the confidential *Issue saliency analysis report for Green Party of England & Wales*\), which Webb summarised and presented at the party conference in October 2018. Nick Martin, former CEO of the Green Party, has confirmed its impact \[S4.6\]: ‘your report helped me and others hold the line strategically against those who wanted some sort of appeal to the whole electorate on a more narrow environmentalist pitch. Your analysis helped maintain an evidence base to what the Party was doing and helped retain a focus on available or potentially available electors.’ The Greens’ former Policy & Governance Manager, Matthew Browne, confirmed that the report ‘informed the Green Party’s political positioning, being used as evidence to inform Political Strategy Reviews held in January and August 2019. The report has also been used by the General Election Preparation Group, to guide Green Party Manifesto drafting and messaging…’ \[S4.7\]. One of the key messages of the report was that the party needed to emphasize Green housing and transport issues. As Nick Martin says in his email, ‘I think that the work you and Tim did for the party was influential in various choices, e.g. I think you will see quite a lot of coverage of housing in the party's programme and/or manifesto.’ \[S4.6\]. Housing was subsequently the second section of the 2019 manifesto \(after a green new deal for energy\), followed by transport \(another issue emphasized in the report\) \[S5\]. All party proposals on these subjects were in line with PMP recommendations. 

 PMP’s written submission to the Chakrabarti Inquiry on anti\-Semitism in the Labour Party used the 2016 PMP survey of Labour members to show the extent to which anti\-Semitism was regarded as a problem in the Labour Party by its own grassroots, and how such views tended to split along factional lines \(with supporters of Jeremy Corbyn far less inclined to believe the party had an anti\-Semitism problem than his internal opponents\). Subsequently, the House of Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs Report into anti\-Semitism in the UK cited PMP research on the attitudes of party members several times \[S6\]. In particular, the Report is critical of the Chakrabarti Inquiry’s conduct and conclusions, largely because of a sense of complacency regarding the extent of the problem. PMP research was one of the evidential sources on which the Select Committee drew \[S6, p.40\]. 

 In May 2019, as a direct result of PMP research, PMP advised MPs Stella Creasy & Lisa Nandy about the demographic profile of a proposed Citizens’ Assembly of Labour members on Brexit. Creasy said: ‘just want to say thank you so much for your help with our together against Brexit stuff \- it definitely shifted things in Labour’ \[S4.8\]. 

 Finally, the Head of General & Social Statistics at the House of Commons Library has confirmed the usefulness of PMP data for the Library’s work in briefing MPs, the media and external users, citing it as being ‘routinely in our “top 10” downloaded briefings on social statistics – typically it is downloaded around 400 times a week’ \[S4.9\]. In particular, PMP research informed a House of Commons Research Briefing on party members \(9 August 2019\).

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Traditional methods of cost\-benefit analysis \(CBA\) under\-value investment in ‘smart’ technologies. To overcome this challenge, Queen Mary’s Prof. Moriarty developed a new Real Options CBA model, a decision\-making process, and software in collaboration with Electricity North West Ltd. \(ENWL\), the electricity distribution network for north\-west England. ENWL has incorporated Moriarty’s software tools to benefit 102,396 customers across 14 projects. ENWL has now integrated these tools as part of their business practice to compare flexible and inflexible capital investments. This change has enabled the network to provide better\-value electricity for 2,400,000 homes and informed National Grid policy on the use of Real Options in cost\-benefit analyses. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by Queen Mary’s Prof. Moriarty has played an instrumental role in overcoming the challenges of cost\-benefit analysis \(CBA\) for electricity distribution networks. Traditional methods of CBA are deterministic: they do not account for the value of uncertainty and flexibility, such as the ability to delay, expand, or scale back an investment, in energy networks. As a result, they under\-value new ‘smart’ technologies such as demand\-side response, a method that aims to reduce and redistribute peak\-time energy usage to mitigate strain and use resources more efficiently. Instead, they favour inflexible and capital\-intensive infrastructure \(e.g. transformers, overhead lines\). This makes it highly challenging for networks to compare flexible and inflexible network investments fairly, to justify ‘smart’ network upgrades, and to obtain best value for money by investing in energy\-use innovation. 

 Moriarty’s research uniquely demonstrates how a probabilistic approach, which accounts for randomness and flexibility, can be applied to investments in electricity distribution networks. His work \(for example, \[3.1\]\) builds on Real Options Analysis \(ROA\), a principled framework by which to calculate and compare the value of both flexible and inflexible investments. Moriarty first worked on developing a prototype spreadsheet implementation of ROA in collaboration with Dr. Pierluigi Mancarella \(University of Manchester\). 

 In 2016, he collaborated again with Mancarella and Dr. Rita Shaw at Electricity North West Ltd. \(ENWL\) \[3.2\] to develop and justify a novel stochastic model for how the inherently random \(stochastic\) process of peak network loads evolves over time. Moriarty’s unique contribution was to develop a ‘Real Options Cost Benefit Analysis’ \(RO CBA\) tool which does not require the assumption of geometric Brownian motion, an approach that is commonplace in mathematical finance, but one which has not been justified as a way of modelling electricity demand \[3.3\]. Instead, Moriarty’s approach develops the network operator’s own long\-term demand forecasts into a probabilistic framework for investment decision\-making. In addition, it provides an objective approach to quantifying appropriate demand\-side response compensation \(customers participating in demand\-side response require compensation, as such schemes rely upon customers temporarily reducing their demand\) \[3.4\]. 

 After developing and refining this model in work commissioned by ENWL, and adding a new metric \(‘least worst regret’\), Moriarty supported the electricity distribution network in extending and refining the prototype into a business\-as\-usual tool with which to evaluate the value and impact of network investments.

 Figure 1: Map of the UK with the area served by ENWL highlighted in blue 

Moriarty’s research and ‘Real Options Cost Benefit Analysis’ \(RO CBA\) tool set a precedent for its successful use in an electricity distribution network context, and generated three key impacts. It has: 

1.  Provided access to better\-value electricity for 5,000,000 people across 2,400,000 million homes 

1.  Informed strategic investment decision\-making at ENWL 

1.  Influenced guidelines on cost benefit analyses for national network investments and prevented potential losses 

  

#  Providing access to better\-value electricity for 5,000,000 people across 2,400,000 million homes 

 ENWL is one of 14 electricity distributors in the UK and serves 2,400,000 of the UK’s \~30,000,000 customers, in the north\-west of England \(area of service highlighted in Figure 1\). It owns, operates, maintains and upgrades 13,000km of overhead lines, 44,000km of underground cables, and related transformers and switchgear. 

 Moriarty’s RO CBA tool has been adopted by ENWL to compare investment strategies using a set of long\-term demand forecasting scenarios. It has been used to make 14 investment decisions, with 102,396 customers directly benefiting from local upgrades across the 14 projects. By using the tool, ENWL has improved the cost\-effectiveness of their electricity supply for 5,000,000 people across 2,400,000 homes according to Flexibility Solutions Manager Lois Clark, as the financial saving “is passed back to all 2.4 million of our customers in the form of reduced electricity bills. We recover our costs by charging electricity suppliers for the use of our network, which for domestic customers equates to about 16% of their average electricity bill” \[5.1\]. Moriarty’s tool provides a much improved method of risk assessment over the company’s prior process, as ""previously this was a time\-consuming task performed by hand, which did not identify an optimal strategy and lacked additional decision metrics \(e.g. risk assessments\) that the RO CBA model provides. The RO CBA model enables us to quantify the impact of each strategy, to ensure that the most cost\-effective and risk\-averse investments are made *”* \[5.1\]. 

#  Informing strategic investment decision\-making at ENWL 

 The RO CBA tool has found multiple applications within ENWL beyond its intended purpose, for example planning asset replacement schemes \[5.1\]. Across its network, ENWL faces two key issues: insufficient network capacity \(requiring network reinforcement\), and poor network health \(requiring asset replacement\). While the “RO CBA tool was originally developed with the intention of comparing traditional network reinforcement strategies against innovative demand side response solutions to address network capacity issues, the model is also now being applied to asset replacement schemes in order to determine the most cost\-effective replacement option. This further application of the model has greatly expanded its reach and usefulness within ENWL, as there is approximately triple the number of replacement versus reinforcement schemes,” according to ENWL’s Ms. Clark \[5.1\]. 

#  Influencing guidelines on cost benefit analyses for national network investments and preventing potential losses 

 National Grid plc, which owns and operates the UK’s national transmission network, uses Network Options Analysis \(NOA\) methodology to make recommendations for national network investments based on a set of future demand scenarios. In September 2016, industry regulator Ofgem requested a review of NOA due to concerns over its ability to make efficient investment recommendations, and, in 2017, the review was completed with notable and acknowledged input from Moriarty and ENWL \[5.2\]. Moriarty and his work with ENWL were *“*instrumental in influencing the methodological review and its resulting recommendations, which formed the basis of guidance on National Grid’s use of Real Options Analysis”, according to Adam Hutchinson, Head of Analytical Quality at Ofgem \[5.3\]. According to the report, “our ideas for how Real Options Analysis can be embedded within the NOA are based on the Electricity North West Ltd RO CBA model, and as such there is a precedent for this type of model being implemented in an electricity network context” \[5.2\]. 

 Moriarty’s research saved National Grid plc from potential financial losses stemming from unwise investments in network infrastructure. Dr. Hutchinson confirms that Moriarty *“*demonstrated that implicit assumptions within the Black\-Scholes framework were not appropriate to the network reinforcement context. As a result, I was able to advise National Grid that this approach not be taken forward. This prevented National Grid from implementing the NOA methodology which could have led to unwise network recommendations, costing consumers money. The methodology effectively modelled network investment risk and used Real Options Analysis in a more appropriate way than I had seen previously. The implementation of this methodology at ENWL, which improved performance and saved customers money, set a precedent for how we could effectively address parallel considerations at National Grid. This demonstrable value led me to recommend the approach as best practice in the NOA methodology review *”* \[5.3\]. Moriarty’s RO CBA model has set a precedent for its successful use in a UK electricity distribution network context and, as a result, has influenced related national guidelines.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Southampton’s Environmental Healthcare Unit, within the School of Biological Sciences, has proved the antimicrobial properties of copper alloys by demonstrating their ability to kill a range of harmful pathogens including MRSA and SARS\-CoV2. These findings have led to major clinical trials and influence in public health bodies, leading to the installation of antimicrobial copper touch surfaces globally in hospitals, in supermarkets, on public transport and in the world’s busiest airport. This research has informed retail strategy, shaped government infection control policy and influenced new international standards that have enabled the commercialisation of products with an antimicrobial claim, resulting in the certification of more than 450 copper\-containing antimicrobial products on the market. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Recognised for its antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties, copper has a rich history of being exploited for health purposes. Its first recorded medical use can be found in Egyptian books written between 2600 and 2200 BC, which describe the use of copper in sterilising chest wounds and drinking water. It was used to treat skin infections in ancient Greece, cure ailments in ancient China and India, and remains an important component of traditional medicine today. 

 Research led by Professor Bill Keevil has described the processes through which copper, and its alloys, exhibit their anti\-microbial properties, and has demonstrated the metal’s efficacy in killing superbugs, viruses and fungal pathogens, especially within clinical environments. Studies began in 2002 through a collaboration with the New York\-based Copper Development Association \(CDA\) \[ **G1**\], looking, for the first time, at whether common copper alloys could kill foodborne pathogens. The research showed that copper alloys killed *Escherichia coli O157* \( *E. coli*\) \[ **3.1**\] and *Listeria monocytogenes*, thus highlighting the potential of copper surfaces, as an alternative to stainless steel, when addressing risks of cross\-contamination during food preparation. 

 In 2006, the CDA switched the focus of its funding to researching the efficacy of copper surfaces in reducing rates of healthcare\-associated infections \(HAIs\) amid growing awareness of the scale of the threat posed by HAIs to patient safety. Around that time, HAIs were responsible for infections in 1.7 million people, 98,987 deaths and USD35.7bn\-45bn in treatment costs each year in the US alone, according to government figures. Studies supervised by Keevil at Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham demonstrated that copper alloys kill antibiotic\-resistant ‘superbugs’ methicillin\-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* \(MRSA\), vancomycin\-resistant enterococci \(VRE\) and *Clostridium difficile*. For example, studies showed that two strains of VRE were killed in less than 1 hour on alloys containing 90 per cent copper and *C. difficile* spores died in 24\-48 hours when exposed to copper alloys \[ **3.2**\]. 

 In parallel, the CDA started working with the International Copper Association \(ICA\) in 2005, to obtain official registration of copper alloys as an antimicrobial material with the US Environmental Protection Agency \(EPA\). Keevil’s findings paved the way for the successful development of an EPA\-approved antimicrobial surface test assay, for which Keevil provided guidance based on University of Southampton laboratory methods. In 2008 the EPA certified the Cu\+ trademark underpinned by these methods. This was a first for a solid material. Since then the trademark has been awarded to 450\-plus copper alloys with an antimicrobial touch surface efficacy claim \[ **5.6**\]. 

 During 2012, Keevil and colleagues demonstrated the mechanisms that occur when pathogens land on copper surfaces due to touch, coughs or sneezes. To do this, they developed a ‘wet’ inoculum challenge assay to simulate cough and sneeze droplets falling onto surfaces, and a ‘dry’ challenge assay to facilitate rapid drying of a pathogen inoculum onto a surface to simulate hand contact \[ **3.3**\]. These studies showed that copper ions, released from copper surfaces, rapidly inhibit cell respiration, attack the bacterial cell membrane or disrupt the viral coat, and destroy the DNA and RNA inside. This means that no mutation can occur, preventing the microbe from developing resistance to copper \[ **3.4**\]. This disproved research by other groups, who claimed copper does not affect DNA and RNA integrity. Keevil’s group showed that transfer of antibiotic resistance genes from resistant bacteria to other bacteria is stopped because the nucleic acids encoding these genes are destroyed \[ **3.5**\]. These destructive properties are enhanced by bacterial metabolism, which generates small amounts of hydrogen peroxide. This reacts with the copper ions to form reactive oxygen, which damages the microbes in multiple areas \[ **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Background: Translation of research findings into clinical trials** 

 Keevil’s early research showing the effectiveness of copper in killing *E. coli*, *Listeria* and superbugs formed the basis of two influential clinical trials led by the Copper Development Association \(CDA\) in the UK and US: 

 The UK trial \(2010\) \[ **5.1**\] was funded by the CDA and based in Selly Oak Hospital – the site of Keevil’s studies into superbugs. Keevil was an advisor to the trial and four of his studies were cited as key evidence. The trial reported a 90% reduction in bacterial loading on copper\-plated surfaces. 

 For the US trial \(2013\) \[ **5.2**\] the CDA obtained funding from the Department of Defense, crediting Keevil’s studies in giving them the confidence to undertake a major trial involving three hospitals \[ **5.3**\]. The trial demonstrated a reduction in infection rates of 58% in intensive care units which incorporated copper plating onto the surfaces of six frequently\-touched near\-patient objects. 

 Harold Michels, the Vice President of the CDA, stated: “ *Professor Keevil’s research has not only stimulated others to conduct laboratory research on the antimicrobial properties of copper, but also served as a foundation to those conducting clinical trials. The net result is that he has proven that copper alloys kill numerous microorganisms that cause hospital\-acquired infections… Professor Keevil has persistently and enthusiastically advocated for reducing and preventing hospital acquired infections and thus saving lives by the use of copper.”* \[ **5.3**\] 

 **Installation of antimicrobial copper surfaces in hospitals and other healthcare settings** 

 The list below is a snapshot of the nature and extent of global clinical impact of antimicrobial copper surfaces since 2014, as reported by the CDA, following Keevil’s studies and the subsequent trials \[ **5.4**\]: 

-  Kitasato University Hospital, a newly remodelled, 1,000\-bed hospital in Japan, installed antimicrobial copper door furniture throughout its internal medicine, dermatology, pharmaceutical, haematology and outpatient facilities, while Hitachi Medical Center in Tokyo installed antimicrobial copper beds and overbed tables in its convalescent wards. These were two of nine Japanese hospitals to incorporate antimicrobial copper into their wards in 2014, according to Australian news source ‘Hospital and Healthcare’. 

-  The Sir Robert Ogden Macmillan Centre, a cancer support and information centre that was opened in 2015, and based at Harrogate, installed antimicrobial copper touch surfaces throughout their facility to maximise patient safety. 

-  The 774\-bed Hamburg Asklepios Clinic, a large hospital in Germany that treats 76,000 residents per year, installed antimicrobial copper as part of a refurbishment in 2015. 

-  Santiago Public Emergency Hospital, a leading Chilean hospital, in 2015 installed antimicrobial copper bed rails and handles, and replaced door handles, sinks and taps and overbed tables with antimicrobial copper equivalents. This followed a clinical trial in nearby Valparaíso, which cited Keevil’s studies. 

-  South Africa’s ‘Miracle Trains’ – Transnet’s Phelophepa I and II – provide mobile healthcare to more than 300,000 people in remote rural communities annually. In 2015 the 18\-coach trains were equipped with antimicrobial copper door handles and cupboard doors. 

-  Grinnell Regional Medical Center, the largest hospital in Iowa serving 40,000 residents, took the decision in 2016 to install antimicrobial copper hardware and components throughout its facility. 

 Overall, in the two years after the 2013 trial, the CDA recorded 60 hospitals in 20 countries in Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia that had installed antimicrobial copper surfaces and furniture. Installations had predominantly taken place in clinical settings where patients are at high risk for infections, such as ICU rooms, paediatric and neonatal units, and cancer centres. \[ **5.5**\]. 

 In terms of the economic significance, drawing upon the 2013 trial, a health economics assessment by the University of York \[ **5.6**\] found that the cost of replacing the six near\-patient objects in a 20\-bed intensive care unit can be recouped in less than two months. This translates to a 5\-year saving of almost GBP2,000,000 if antimicrobial copper surfaces are fitted during a planned build or refurbishment. 

 **Installation of antimicrobial copper surfaces in public venues, transport infrastructure and commercial settings** 

 Keevil’s demonstration of the benefits of antimicrobial copper has led to its use in public settings and transportation. The CDA reported the installation in 2014 of antimicrobial copper drinking fountains in the world’s busiest airport, Atlanta \(107m passengers in 2018\) and antimicrobial copper handrails on Poland’s *Solis Urbino* bus \(European Bus of the Year, 2017\). \[ **5.7**\] 

 Keevil has a longstanding association with electroplating firm Necon Technologies Ltd, who learned of his research while investigating legionella control through copper silver ionisation. Necon’s copper touch surface business, *Copper Cover*, has relied on Bill’s validation of their products to bring them to market, including a 2020 test for SARS\-CoV2. The pandemic has seen the company coat more than 10,000 commonly touched surfaces in locations such as care homes, hospitals and schools. \[ **5.8**\] 

 Later in 2020, the UK Department for International Trade \(DIT\) introduced Keevil to the UK supermarket chain Morrisons, who resultantly commissioned Copper Cover to trial the installation of copper touch surfaces in its staff rooms. Currently 1 in 5 infections are transmitted in supermarkets, and Morrisons serve 12 million customers each week across 494 stores throughout the UK \[ **5.9**\]. The trial has led Morrisons to consider the permanent installation of antimicrobial copper surfaces on common touch points such as door push plates and trolley handles: 



 **Informing government infection control policies in Europe and shaping new international regulatory standards for commercial products with antimicrobial claims** 

 Following the approval of copper as an antimicrobial material by the US Environmental Protection Agency \(EPA\), which was based on Keevil’s research, Poland’s National Centre for Quality Assessment in Healthcare \(NCQA\) revised its accreditation standards for healthcare facilities. This included in 2017, Europe’s first official recommendation to incorporate antimicrobial copper touch surfaces as an infection prevention and control measure \[ **5.10**\]. The new accreditation standards provide guidelines concerning the prevention of pathogen transmission by touch. Chapter IX ‘Infection Control’ states: “ *Reduction of microbial transmission should be achieved, inter alia, using frequently\-touched surfaces made from metals with antimicrobial properties, such as copper, brass and bronze, as per the US Environmental Protection Agency’s registration*.” 

 Lubin Hospital, in South West Poland, subsequently installed copper alloy surfaces in its new operating theatres. In recognition of his contribution, Keevil was invited as the Special Guest at the ‘Safe Hospital for the Future’ Gala awards event in Warsaw, where he gave the keynote lecture on ‘Breaking the Chain of Infection’. The event was attended by senior members of the Polish medical community, including the Polish Deputy Minister of Health and the Director of the World Health Organization \(WHO\) Office in Poland \[ **5.7**\]. 

 In 2014, Keevil was an invited speaker at a meeting in the French National Assembly in Paris attended by French MPs, WHO officials and the French Patients Association \(Le Ligne\). At this meeting the introduction of antimicrobial copper alloy surfaces to reduce HAIs in French hospitals was discussed. This led to further successful trials of copper alloy fittings in long\-term care facilities in 2018, supported by regional French government and the European Commission, and the decision to draw up a French standard, equivalent to the EPA standard in the US. France’s equivalent AFNOR \(Standards Commission S95S, N36\) adopted the dry method testing method developed at Southampton \[ **3.1**\] to evaluate copper alloy and non\-copper products with an antimicrobial surface claim for commercialisation. Keevil attended several AFNOR meetings, following on from the original French National Assembly event, and contributed expert advice based on his research. The new AFNOR standard \(NF S90\-700\) was published in April 2019 and since led to the successful establishment of a new technical committee on *Surfaces with biocidal and antimicrobial Properties* at the International Organization of Standardization \(ISO\) in June 2020 \[ **5.11**\]. The wet and dry testing methods developed at Southampton \[ **3.1**\] have been translated into standard CEN/ISO test methods by the British Standards Institute \[ **5.12**\]. 

 **Commercial impact arising from the government\-approved certification of the Cu\+ trademark for antimicrobial copper products** 

 Keevil’s work has influenced the development of test standards, which the CDA states are *“essential  for  international  competitiveness  of  companies  selling antimicrobial  materials  such as  copper  alloys’’* \[ **5.7**\]. The new international standards, which regulate the commercialisation of products with an antimicrobial touch surface claim, have resulted in the certification of more than 450 copper\-containing antimicrobial products on the market \[ **5.7**\]. This includes a specific product line “KME Plus®” from KME, one of the world’s largest manufacturer of copper and copper alloy products. The company increased their revenue from USD1,440,000 in 2014 to USD1,980,000 in 2019, and directly refer to Keevil’s work in their official KME Plus® information brochure \[ **5.13**\]. 

 **Health and commercial impact through copper\-infused clothing** 

 *Copper Clothing* *Ltd* was set up in December 2012 after the founder saw a demonstration by Keevil online showing the speed at which MRSA dies on copper compared to stainless steel. Keevil was commissioned by the company in 2014 to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of copper\-impregnated fabrics, in products including bed sheets, pyjamas and socks. This paved the way for further R&D activities in the NHS and direct employment of a doctor at the company. Additionally, research led by Keevil has underpinned developments of their copper\-impregnated facemask, with over 250,000 units now sold \[ **5.14**\]. 

 **Increasing public awareness of the benefits of antimicrobial copper** 

 Keevil’s advocacy of the benefits of antimicrobial copper have gone far beyond his numerous peer\-reviewed papers and presentations at high\-profile conferences. His proactive engagement with the international media has resulted in widespread coverage. In the UK this includes BBC News channels, the BBC’s One Show and Dara Ó Briain’s Science Club \(19,732 views\) while coverage abroad includes Le Figaro and Times of India. It was featured in 35 news stories from 34 outlets and reached an upper bound of two million followers on Twitter. A 2017 article by Keevil in The Conversation, which brought together all Southampton research in this area, reached an audience of 234,210 and was tweeted 487 times and shared on Facebook 14,700 times. Keevil’s 2020 Smithsonian Magazine article on ‘coppers virus killing powers’ was shared over 6,000 times on social media. Over the impact period, coverage of Keevil’s combined research reached an estimated hundreds of millions of people, measured by examples of media coverage provided by the CDA \[ **5.7**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A focus on inward investment from international productions and deference to a traditional canon had stymied new, more diverse Moroccan filmmakers and diminished the significance of Moroccan cultural influence on world cinema. 

 The Transnational Moroccan Cinema \(TMC\) project generated new ways of thinking and has changed film cultural policy among Moroccan film industry professionals and academics. TMC brought together 100 Moroccan cineastes at a debate in 2016 which led key industry figures to develop a new film cultural strategy. It has enabled diverse filmmakers, particularly women, to be accepted into the canon. A pioneering feminist film, preserved by TMC, has been accepted as one of 25 films key to Moroccan history and internationally exhibited. Emerging filmmakers have been supported with professional development and routes to international markets. Throughout the project 70 young Moroccan filmmakers have benefited from workshops and opportunities for collaborations including residencies in London for two emerging talents to develop new projects.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research for this case study builds on Higbee’s work on transnational cinema. The key findings of this research \[see **3.1, 3.2, 3.3 & 3.6**\], propose that an exclusive focus on the national, or \(in the case of Moroccan cinema\) the francophone, is detrimental to the understanding of the production, distribution and exhibition of films. Further insights and findings emerged from the AHRC\-funded “Transnational Moroccan Cinema” project \(TMC\) \(December 2015 – December 2018\) and the follow\-on project “An Alternative Distribution Network for Moroccan Cinema: Online Audiences, Festival Networks and Transnational Talent Development” \(November 2019 – November 2020\). The TMC research project was led by Higbee \(PI\), with Prof Florence Martin \(international CI\) and Dr Jamal Bahmad and Dr Stefanie Van de Peer as Research Fellows. 

 While existing research, critical discourse and audience reception display a deference for the older generation of cineastes and the ‘canon’ of Moroccan cinema, there is a distinct lack of access to the history of Moroccan cinema for aspiring filmmakers both in Morocco and internationally. \[ **3.4**\] While the Moroccan Film Council \(Centre Cinématographique Marocain – CCM\) has the space to store old films on 35mm format, the facility is not future\-proofed. Furthermore, women’s films were specifically at risk of being lost through patriarchal canon formation and neglect. Higbee’s project has restored, subtitled and digitised one historically important woman’s film, *A Door to the Sky* by Farida Benlyazid \(1989\), and made it newly available for global screenings. *La Falaise* \(Besaïdi, 1997\) an artistically significant short film by one of Morocco’s most important contemporary directors, will be restored and digitised in 2021. 

 The CCM’s strategic focus had prioritised inward investment from international productions, to the detriment of Moroccan filmmakers \[ **3.3**\]. There was no network of support between different levels of the industry: funders, producers and filmmakers did not enter into meaningful dialogue and were not sufficiently supported by the CCM in realising international co\-production or exposure for their films. Meanwhile, younger Moroccan filmmakers looked outward, towards Europe and America, rather than exploring their own cinematic heritage \[ **3.4**\] and existing film education did not translate into viable career opportunities. Morocco’s main film festivals \[see **3.5**\] in Marrakech and Tangiers lacked opportunities for Moroccan filmmakers. Marrakech was criticised in 2016 for not including a single Moroccan filmmaker, while the Tangiers festival’s invite\-only format excludes those filmmakers who are not yet established. 

 The key findings outlined above have been disseminated by the TMC research team on the project website and via social media, in articles and book chapters, as well as a monograph and edited collection. Two international conferences \(in Marrakech in December 2016 and Edinburgh in October 2018\) for academics and industry professionals, offered a key space for knowledge exchange. Higbee was invited to present his research in Morocco \(Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tetouan, in November 2019\) and internationally \(at HKU/CUHK, Hong Kong, in April 2018 and at HKBU in December 2018\). In November 2018 he served as president of the jury at the International Film School Festival, Tetouan.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Higbee’s work has increased access to the archives of Moroccan cinema globally; created opportunities for emerging filmmakers in Morocco; and changed awareness of, and interest in, Moroccan films on an international level for both audiences and industry professionals. Specifically, the following impacts have been achieved: 

###  1. Safeguarding and promoting works of historical significance 

 At the TMC conference ‘Morocco in Motion: the global reach of Moroccan Cinema’ \(Edinburgh, October 26\-28, 2018\), writer and director Farida Benlyazid revealed that her pioneering feminist film *A* *Door to the Sky* was stored at the CCM. The film had been considered “lost” as it did not have English subtitles and the French subtitles needed review, and the original 35mm film had deteriorated. Determined to make it available to a Moroccan and international audience, Higbee’s team shipped the film to the UK, where it was restored, subtitled in English and French, and digitised. It was then donated to the filmmaker and placed in the CCM archive in Rabat. \[ **5.1**\] 

 Higbee then persuaded the CCM to celebrate a world premiere of the restored film at the National Film Festival in Tangiers, for an audience of almost 300. \[ **5.2**\] It has since played at a number of international online festivals during the Covid\-19 pandemic, including the Africa in Motion Festival \(28/11/20, 57 views\) and the Being Human national festival of the humanities \(21/11/2020, 44 views\). Clear evidence of the film’s new lease of life as a result of Higbee’s work can be seen in its inclusion by the CCM in a selection of 25 films key to Moroccan film history that were streamed free online during March and April 2020 – viewed by 2,220 people in Morocco.\[ **5.2**\] 

###  2. Changing attitudes within and about Moroccan cinema 

 In December 2016, as part of the Marrakech International Film Festival \(MIFF\), in collaboration with the Moroccan Chamber of Film Producers \(MCFP\), Higbee organised a round\-table discussion about the state of the Moroccan film industry. The event was attended by more than 100 industry professionals and academics, including CCM director Sarim Fassi Fihri \[ **5.3**\]. At a time of perceived crisis for the Moroccan film industry \(with no Moroccan films having been selected for the MIFF\), it provided an opportunity to formulate a collective strategy. Key industry figures present committed to meeting twice a year in a forum that continues the initiatives begun by TMC. 

 *“After the Marrakech debates, we created a ‘National Coordination’, involving trade unions and professional organisations in the sector, aimed to set new priorities, and \[meet\] challenges such as the great one of winning back our own audiences and defining a cultural policy. We will continue this work and hope to bring more attention and confidence to Moroccan filmmakers.”*  – Ahmed El\-Maanouni, former president of the MCFP \[ **5.4**\] 

 At the Morocco in Motion conference, TMC invited a diverse selection of 15 Moroccan artists and industry practitioners to participate in a series of round\-table discussions in Edinburgh. Those who attended described how it had allowed a constructive debate to flourish: 

 *“Today I met people I did not have the opportunity to meet in Morocco. Thank you for having made this meeting possible, because I find this event priceless. It’s really exceptional to have the time and the opportunity to speak intelligently with so many people \[about Moroccan cinema\], to meet some of you for the first time.”* – film producer Lamia Chraïbi \[ **5.5**\] 

 Higbee’s research has led directly to greater international collaborations for the Moroccan film industry. Between 2017 and 2019, he consulted for UK production company Hurricane Films for a commercial feature film, *Beatrice and Her Father*, set in Morocco, advising how to navigate funding and co\-production and brokering meetings with their eventual co\-producer, Lamai Chraïbi. Shooting is due to commence in spring 2021. Hurricane Films have described Higbee’s contribution as ‘ *invaluable*’. \[ **5.6**\] 

###  3. Creating opportunities for emerging talent 

 Higbee’s research team organised debates at international film festivals between young and established professionals, enabling for the first\-time interactions between these different generations of Moroccan cinema. In addition, working in collaboration with the LFS \(2017\-2019\), Higbee delivered a series of pitching and cinematography workshops in Tetouan, as well as two residencies for emerging Moroccan filmmakers in London \[ **5.7**\]. Activist filmmaker Nadir Bouhmouch participated in both TMC conferences, and Higbee’s research team has promoted his work through online interviews and research publications. 

 *“It gave me the opportunity to meet filmmakers whose films have been influential and dear to me for so long. ... This has given me a renewed determination at a time when I was beginning to feel hopeless and isolated.”* – Nadir Bouhmouch, after the 2016 conference in Marrakech \[ **5.7**\] 

 Bouhmouch has since participated in the prestigious Venice Final Cut development programme and his latest documentary was selected for leading documentary festival Hot Docs \(Toronto\). Higbee has also introduced Bouhmouch’s work to a wider range of film festivals and filmmakers. As a direct result of Higbee’s recommendation to the festival, The Folk Film Gathering \(Edinburgh\) screened Bouhmouch’s latest documentary at the 2020 online edition of the festival, inviting the filmmaker to participate in a filmmaker roundtable, where Bouhmouch established a collaboration with renowned British documentary collective Amber. \[ **5.9**\] 

 French\-Moroccan filmmaker Sofia el Khyari found participation in the Edinburgh conference and the screening of her film *Ayam* at the AiM film festival \(see photo \[ **5.1**\]\) a similarly transformative experience: “ *I returned to Paris, with my head full of projects, inspiration and ambition\!\! … I can't thank you enough for inviting me and promoting my young work to everyone.”* \[ **5.7**\] 

 Higbee’s project promoted further transnational talent development through collaboration with the London Film School \(LFS\) and the International Film School Film Festival in Tetouan \(FIDEC\). Two Moroccan documentary\-makers spent a term in residence at the LFS in spring 2017, developing new projects \(see Janjague and El Hachadi testimonies \[ **5.7**\]\), while Higbee and a delegation of LFS staff and students were invited by Abdelmalek Essaadi University to participate in the third FIDEC festival in November that same year. They returned in 2018 and 2019 to deliver three further pitching and filmmaking workshops for around 70 young Moroccan filmmakers, providing significant support and feedback to those seeking national and international funding for projects. In 2018, Higbee presided over the festival jury **\[5.1\]**. 

###  4. Extending audience reach and challenging perceptions of Moroccan cinema 

 By collaborating with the UK’s leading African film festival, Africa in Motion \(AiM\), and its partner organisations over the past four years, Higbee has increased understanding of the significance of Moroccan cinema in an African context. More than 500 people saw Moroccan films programmed at the festival as a result of TMC’s involvement. AiM producer Justine Atkinson’s testimony explains that TMC’s influence on curatorial practices enabled *“audiences to navigate a carefully curated programme of film screenings and events, therefore increasing their knowledge and access to Moroccan cinema at a time of disproportionally low levels of public exposure to Moroccan films*”. \[ **5.9**\] 

 The number of Moroccan events programmed at AiM rose from two in 2016 to nine in 2018, while the Moroccan film *Transes* \(El Maanouni, 1981\) was picked up by two other UK festivals: Watch Africa Cymru, in Wales \(November 2017\), and Open Colour, in Bristol \(April 2019\). TMC also delivered masterclasses with Moroccan filmmakers and panel discussions following screenings, which introduced new audiences to Moroccan film culture, and positively changed attitudes towards North African cinema, which has often been seen as separate from sub\-Saharan African cinema. \[ **5.9, 5.10**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Edinburgh Napier University \(ENU\) has led to new ways of creating contemporary church music. Harris has commissioned composers, created a new record label, and has recorded CDs featuring the Choir of St. Giles’ Cathedral, Edinburgh. This has led to novel contributions from British composers to the field of church music.The research has had a beneficial reputational and commercial influence on St Giles’ Cathedral, receiving acknowledgment of its influence on the atmosphere for the cathedral’s 1.4million estimated annual visitors. The choir has also performed the created music on international tours, and the record label has sold almost 1,500 CD copies.The work has also informed the practices of composers and influenced national and international concert audiences via the BBC. Commissioned work was performed on BBC Radio 3, and CD releases, including *O Clap Your Hands,* have provided an international platform for composers to redefine church music. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 With the exception of very few contemporary works, much of the music used in worship by churches in the UK was written between the 16<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. This has often led to a reductive view of church music by both congregations and the wider public. As a result, churches and performers have often struggled for relevance and exposure in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. In an attempt to reverse this trend, the underpinning research has focused on improving the breadth and diversity of contemporary church music. 

 Michael Harris is a Lecturer at ENU and Master of the Music at St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, one of the largest and most renowned churches in Scotland. He has led this research body with contributions from fellow lecturer and composer Stewart Murray Mitchell. 

 Harris has developed a self\-termed “Edinburgh model” **\[O1,O2\]** for the reinvigoration of church music, based on his work with St Giles Cathedral. He has provided composers with opportunities to work in the domain of church music, requiring compositions to consider worshipping congregations and their attitudes towards ‘new’ music. The purpose of sacred music in this context is to enhance the act of worship, effecting a change of emotion in the listener and contributing to their religious or spiritual experience. This ‘new’ music also engages with a new generation of churchgoers, who may have previously considered church music to be outmoded or prosaic. 

 In 2014, Harris commissioned two Edinburgh\-based composers, Stuart Murray Mitchell, who became a PhD student and lecturer at ENU a year later, and Chris Hutchings, to compose two new works for the Cathedral Choir with funding from The Friends of the Music of St Giles’ Cathedral **\[P1\]**. The resultant works, *Five Introits* and *O Praise the Lord Ye Angels of His,* fulfilled two purposes; to create a group of introits that could be used throughout the liturgical year, and an anthem to enhance the experience of the worshipping congregation **\[O2\]**. 

 Following these successful compositions, Harris programmed a similar series of works by renowned living composers in both a liturgical and in a concert setting. The result has been a series of recordings created by high\-profile composers and performed by the Cathedral Choir **\[O3, O4\]**. 

 As a result of this initial research, Harris secured subsequent funding from The Friends of the Music of St Giles’ Cathedral to commission a number of new works from internationally renowned musicians. Rory Boyle’s *O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P2, O4\]** *,* Ann Millikan’s *Preston Toccata* **\[P3, O5\]** *,* and Jonathan Pitkin’s *As Kingfishers Catch Fire* **\[P4, O6\]** are further new compositions which have been recorded for worship and used for concerts at St Giles’, performed by the Cathedral Choir and the organist at that time, Peter Backhouse.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 2014 this research has benefitted composers, St Giles’ Cathedral, and the St Giles’ Cathedral choir, and has reached national and international audiences. It has: \(i\) developed stimuli to cultural tourism and contributed to the quality of the tourist experience at St Giles, which attracts around 1.4million visitors per year; \(ii\) enhanced the reputation and commercial income of St Giles; and \(iii\) enhanced the quality of life for composers, performers, and audiences of church music. 

 **Growing International Audiences and Increasing Tourist Visitors to St. Giles’ Cathedral** 

 Harris’ programming of new works has led to a number of novel concerts and recitals by the Cathedral Choir and their organist **\[O1\-O6\]**.  This has enhanced the reputation of the Cathedral as a forward\-thinking institution that highly values its contribution to both worship and culture. The choir performed the commissioned work in tours in Germany in 2015 and the United States in 2017, thus enhancing their international profile. Information on the tours is provided below:

-  *Preston Toccata* – Ann Millikan 

  -  13<sup>th</sup> May 2017, St Giles’ Cathedral, Edinburgh 

  -  2<sup>nd</sup> August, 2017, St Giles’ Cathedral, Edinburgh 

 Furthermore, these new works have been used regularly in services of worship to a congregation comprising a diverse cross\-section of the public. These include those who do not regularly attend concerts featuring contemporary music, in addition to the large number of tourists who attend services at St Giles’ Cathedral due to its central location in Edinburgh’s Old Town. In her letter detailing the number of visitors to the Cathedral, Sarah Phemister, Head of Heritage and Culture at St. Giles’, outlines how ‘ *Michael’s work on our music programme has a tremendous impact…The popularity of our music programme, and the strong reputation it has developed under Michael’s stewardship, ensures that we often attract large crowds to these events*’ and that ‘ *no less significant, is the role of the music programme in fostering a welcoming atmosphere in St. Giles’’* **\[C6\]**. 

 **Launch of the Aegidius Record Label and Commercial and Reputational Benefit to St. Giles Cathedral** 

 In 2014, as a result of his research, Harris was responsible for creating the Cathedral’s new record label, Aegidius, with the launch of its first two compact discs; *O Clap Your Hands* and *On Christmas Night*. This was featured in the pages of *The Herald* newspaper \(estimated weekly readership 91,000, 2014\) **\[C4\]** and the first CD received a four\-star review in *Choir and Organ* magazine. The review by Shirley Ratcliffe stated: ‘ *St. Giles’s excellent Cathedral Choir directed by Michael Harris is in fine voice for a programme of sacred music written between 1914 and 2014’* **\[C3\]** and makes specific reference to the commissioning of new works by Stuart Murray Mitchell and Chris Hutchings. 

 The raison d'être of both discs **\[O3, O4\]** was to further the reputation of the Cathedral Choir and to solidify its commitment to enhancing the reputation of Scottish church music. As a result of the collaboration, St Giles’ Cathedral is one of only four cathedrals in Scotland who have commercially available recordings. As the first of these discs, *O Clap Your Hands* **\[O3\]**, comprises only works written between 1914\-2014, it provides a valuable snapshot of British liturgical choral music over the past century, and celebrates the diversity of church music which is still very much apparent today. 

 The second disc, *On Christmas Night*, similarly features a number of works from living composers, namely Cecilia McDowall, Gabriel Jackson, and Matthew Owens in addition to early\-career composer, Andrew Carvel. Along with a third release, *The Auld Alliance: Organ Music from Scotland and France*, and a fourth release, *Laudate Dominum: Sing Praises to God\!* **\[O4\]**, which features Boyle’s *O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P4\]**, the label has sold nearly 1,500 copies of its releases to date **\[C2\]**. In a letter from David W. S. Todd, President of the The Friends of the Music of St. Giles’ Cathedral, he outlines how profits from the sales of Aegidius releases have been used to fund new recordings and commission more new works for choir and organ over the next five years. Todd states how *‘these commissions will be important and significant additions to the repertoire for Cathedral/Church choirs and, because, the funds from the Friends are self\-generating they can also be recorded and these will add greatly to the value of the commissions. The Friends commend this model of funding, commissioning, performing and recording new works*.’ **\[C7\]**. 

 **Influence on Composers and Their Contribution to the Musical Canon** 

 Through the commissioning process Harris has facilitated an expansion of contemporary church music repertoire. This includes three works suitable as anthems \( *O Praise the Lord Ye Angels of His, O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P2\]** *, As Kingfishers Catch Fire* **\[P4, O6\]**\), a collection of introits \( *Five Introits* **\[O2\]**\), and an organ voluntary \( *Preston Toccata* **\[P3, O5\]**\), all of which demonstrate the vibrancy of contemporary church music. Furthermore, a number of works, particularly *Five Introits* **\[O2\]** and *O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P2\]** *,* were composed with the amateur musician in mind, allowing them to be subsumed into numerous church repertoires from cathedrals to smaller institutions.As a composer, Mitchell explains how Harris’s ‘ *championing of new music has had a profound effect on my own work. The subsequent recording of two of the introits afforded me with evidence of my output, in turn, aiding its dissemination to a wider audience through sales of the CD around the UK and abroad. Furthermore, these recordings have provided me with a vital artefact which attests to my experience in writing for choir, bolstering prospective opportunities for commissioning by other organisations and individuals’* **\[C8\]**. 

 Whilst the majority of new commissions utilise choral forces with or without accompaniment and feature a sacred text, *Preston Toccata* **\[P3, O5\]** is a solo organ work based on two traditional bagpipe tunes, celebrating the union between Scotland and France.

1.  **1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\)** 

 UAL’s commitment to driving social, cultural and institutional change in relation to inequalities in the arts that result from issues around ethnic and national identity has had—and continues to have—extensive impact. UAL has enabled this by establishing within the University a range of influential academic positions and research projects, as well as research centres in the field, which are impacting the wider discourse. Key to this is UAL’s Black Artists and Modernism \(BAM\) project, which, by uncovering and making visible Black\-British artists and their work, has impacted on national collections’ development policy and strategy; archiving and accessions management; exhibition curation; the interpretation of works within museum and gallery settings, and supporting events in the UK and internationally. The project has changed public, professional and academic discourses, with these artists beginning to be properly positioned within narratives of historical and contemporary art.

1.  **2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\)** 

#  Key to expanding knowledge in the area of the representation of Black\-British artists in the UK and internationally was the publication of Boyce, Bailey and Baucom’s *Shades of Black: Assembling Black Arts in 1980s Britain* \(2005\), the outcome of research into the previous 20 years of Black Art in Britain. \[3.1.\] Focusing particularly on the Thatcher period and the explosion of the Black Arts Movement in the wake of civil unrest and rioting in British cities, the book created a dialogue between leading artists, curators, art historians and critics. Combining cultural theory with anecdotal testimonies and experience, it examined how Black\-British artists of the 1980s might be viewed historically and explored the political, cultural and artistic developments that sparked the movement. The book built on papers presented at a Duke University conference \(2001\) and included a comprehensive timeline of Black\-British art from 1960 onwards. Awarded the Historians of British Art Book Prize \(2007\), the first publication focused exclusively on Black arts to win the prize since it was established in 1996, *Shades of Black* has become an established point of reference for the study of Black Art and British cultural developments during the period. 

#  UAL’s *Black Artists and Modernism* research project \(2015–2018, AHRC, GBP722,681.00\) continued the University’s work in this area. The project recognised that, despite the fact that Black\-British artists have made a fundamental contribution to modernist discourse internationally, at that point, only a handful of references related to this field of practice directly. As part of the investigation into the impact of Black\-British art on the broader narratives of modern and contemporary art practice, the research team \(Boyce, lok, Dibosa with Goodwin, Dalal\-Clayton and Nasar as fellows\) developed the hypothesis that publicly funded galleries, museums and collections in the UK held works by artists of African and Asian heritage that are at best rarely and at worst never seen by the public or have become ‘lost’ or ‘hidden’, and that the quantity of this work and the artworks themselves needed to be scrutinised. A major question for the research was how to counter the tendency for contemporary discourse focused on the ethnicity of the artist and the general problematics of race and identity politics within the art establishment, thus deflecting attention away from how these artworks relate to or have influenced the development of 20<sup>th</sup>\-century art. \[3.2.\] 

#  The project comprised four interlocking areas. The ‘BAM Audit’, led by Dalal\-Clayton, researched artworks by artists of African, Caribbean, Asian and MENA Region \(Middle East and North Africa\) descent held in public collections in the UK. 30 UK collections were surveyed including the Government Art Collection, Pallant House Gallery and the Royal Academy of Arts. BAM’s monographic strand examined the relationship to modernism of artworks by Black\-British artists; a museological strand examined the decision\-making and procedures of the public institutions in acquiring the artworks, and the interpretive strategies used to contextualise them within the wider narratives of the collections, while curatorial research reviewed key exhibitions, mainly from the 1980s, that involved Black\-British artists as curators. 

 UAL’s research into the Hayward Gallery’s pivotal 1989/90 exhibition, *The Other Story: Afro\-Asian artists in post\-war Britain* \(curated by Rasheed Aareen\), has played an important part in underpinning the University’s study of Black\-British artists. **Boyce** \(with Jean Fisher\) examined *The Other Story* as one of three case studies from 1989, a pivotal year for both art and politics. \[3.3.\] 

#  As a counterpoint to UAL’s long\-term investigation into Black\-British artists and their work, a key element of research in this area has been the consideration of ‘the audience’. Dibosa’s research considers the audience experience in relation to the work of the art museum. It does this from the perspectives of the art museum itself and of the visitors it seeks to attract. Through the analysis of material gathered from a major collaborative research project carried out at Tate Britain, the project reconfigured the relationship between art, culture and society conceptually in relation to race. \[3.4.\]

1.  **4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)** 

 UAL has created a space in which a multiplicity of approaches can be debated, and conflicts in perspectives on Black\-British art and artists interrogated. Understanding of the processes involved in how works by Black\-British artists have become ‘lost’ or ‘hidden’ is increasing. UAL’s investment in the research has led to strategic internal appointments as well as UAL scholars being appointed to positions of influence in external organisations and institutions. The University’s support for research into issues around ethnic and national identity as they relate to art and design has led to the creation of UAL Research Centres. TrAIN \(2004, Research Centre for Transnational Art, Identity and Nation\) is a cross\-disciplinary hub for historical, theoretical and practice\-based research. In 2018, UAL invited Iniva \(Institute of International Visual Arts\) to relocate to Chelsea College of Arts; award\-winning artist and UAL alumnus, Yinka Shonibare MBE, commented that the relocation will “maximise the potential of the Stuart Hall Library whilst making a significant contribution to diverse perspectives within the college, in the community, across London, nationally and beyond”. \[5.1.\] In 2020, Shades of Noir \(SoN, established by Aisha Richards in 2009, taking *Shades of Black* as its inspiration\) became UAL’s Centre for Race and Practice\-Based Social Justice, with Richards as Director. The UAL Decolonising Arts Institute \(2019\) was established to challenge colonial and imperial legacies in order to drive cultural, social and institutional change. Through these centres and a number of key academic appointments, UAL is investing in creating social, cultural and institutional impact— **Boyce** was appointed as UAL Chair in Black Art & Design in 2013. UAL’s Decolonising the Arts Institute is working with 15 partners comprising major UK public art collections \(including Tate, Arts Council and British Council collections\) and arts charities \(e.g. Art UK and the Art Fund\) to explore potential collaborative ways of working. UAL researchers have been appointed to a range of high\-profile positions, which is contributing to the scale of the impact of UAL’s work in uncovering Black\-British artists— **Boyce** will represent Britain at the Venice Biennale in 2022, the first black woman to do so. 

 The critically acclaimed Diaspora Pavilion at the Venice Biennale 2017 \(a partnership with UAL co\-curated by David A. Bailey and Jessica Taylor\), brought together 19 international artists \(including UAL’s **lok**, Kimathi Donkor, Joy Gregory, the late Khadija Saye, and Erika Tan; and Isaac Julien, UAL Chair of Global Art, 2014–2016; UAL Honorary Fellow, Hew Locke; and Abbas Zahedi, TrAIN Co\-Lab Artist Research Residency, 2019–2020\), whose wide\-ranging practices variously expand, complicate and destabilise diaspora as an enduring critical concept. The exhibition was part of a larger two\-year programme through which 12 emerging artists were brought together with 10 mentors \(including Gregory, Julien and Locke\). Director, Tate: “The Diaspora pavilion was the greatest energy source of the whole Biennale”. \[5.2.\] 

 A collaboration between UAL and Middlesex University, Black Artists and Modernism \(BAM\) examined the artworks and practices of artists of African and Asian descent. One of the most impactful elements of the project has been the audit, which identified and catalogued a total of 2,085 works by over 300 Black\-British artists. The institutions that took part in the audit report ongoing impact on practices including collections and acquisitions management, archiving policy and methods, and curating practice. Database search functions and terms in many audit institutions have been reviewed. Selections from the extensive positive feedback from 14 audit participants include the Government Art Collection: “The impact of GAC having been part of the original BAM project in 2016 is illustrated in several important and continuing strands of our work… Most significantly of all, the GAC's  [Representation of the People Project](https://artcollection.culture.gov.uk/whats-happening/representation-of-the-people-project-2018-28/), was established in 2018 \[creating\] a seismic shift that has, and is, influencing and informing all aspects of our work. It is a ten\-year commitment to challenge and review under\-representation in the Collection across identities related to age, disability, gender, race, sexuality, and socio\-economic background.” \[5.3.\] Citing the audit during the period after the death of George Floyd in the US and the resurgence of Black Lives Matter, curator and writer Aindrea Emelife \( *The Independent*, June 2020\) identified how “The place where real change begins is in the storage units. What museums have and acquire into their permanent collections matters because museum acquisitions form the canon of black art”. \[5.4.\] 

 As part of the dissemination and the development of the thinking generated by the project, and to enable comprehensive interrogation of the issues, the BAM team created a series of events including two international conferences, a UK\-based symposium, study days and exhibitions *.* \(Selected activities were video\-documented and are available on the UAL Decolonising Arts Institute YouTube channel.\) This activity included a specific event addressing the impact of *The Other Story*, which was to form the basis for content in the digital archive of Afterall \(UAL Reader, Lucy Steeds’ *Retelling “The Other Story”—or What Now?,* 2018\), and a dedicated microsite, supported at the outset by a Digital Project Grant from the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art \(2015–2016\) and, subsequently, by two awards from the Teaching and Learning Exchange at UAL \(2016 and 2017\). Association of Research Institutes in Art History \(ARIAH, 2017–2018\) funding enabled publication of the first essay on this site to analyse the exhibition. \[5.5.\] 

#  Workshops at a one\-day symposium \(Tate Britain, 2016\), *The Work Between Us: Black\-British Artists and Exhibition Histories*, addressed the issue of exhibition texts and labels presenting work by artists of colour through a prism of identity, race and ethnicity. The Public Collections Study Day \(MAG 2018\), the concluding event of the BAM project *,* engaged with curators of museum collections. Focused on the research that the BAM team had conducted on public collections and their curation, the day featured papers given by speakers including Dalal\-Clayton, Dibosa and Nasar. An international conference, ‘Conceptualism—Intersectional Readings, International Framings: Situating ‘Black Artists and Modernism’ in Europe’ \(7–9 December 2017\), in collaboration with Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, proposed and developed new understandings of Conceptualism produced by artists based in Europe after the political and social upheavals of 1968, focusing on Europe in order to highlight the specificities and limits of discourses on ‘Blackness’ and Conceptualism between neighbouring contexts. Co\-convened by lok, Orlando and Aikens, speakers included lok, Boyce, Dibosa. The revised conference papers were edited by the convenors as a 444\-page e\-publication \(Van Abbemuseum, 2019\). \[5.6.\] 

 A special issue of the *Journal of Art History*, presenting essays that examine a range of artists looked at during the BAM project, is due \(summer 2021\), edited by **Boyce** and Dorothy Price. A book on the BAM project is forthcoming \(Duke University Press\). Kenneth Montague, Tate trustee: ""This project is a long\-overdue, absolutely essential resource. For too long the importance of this work to the British arts scene has been overlooked. This initiative is about legacy, setting the record straight."" \[5.7.\] **Dalal\-Clayton**’s article, published by *The Double Negative*, ‘Developing more representative art collections could not be more urgent’ offers an overview and a continuing call for action, post\-BAM. \[5.8.\] **lok** secured the commissioning of a one\-hour BBC4 documentary, *Whoever Heard of a Black Artist? Britain's Hidden Art History*, which followed the research activity and elaborated on what was uncovered, through interviews and by outlining the historical context. \(Presented by **Boyce** and Brenda Emmanus, and featuring **Dibosa**, **Goodwin** and **Nasar**, and Melanie Keen, Director, Iniva. First screened in July 2018: 160,000 viewers; 30,000 iPlayer views. Repeat screenings in July and September 2018: approximately 6,000 viewers.\) 

#  Boyce invited Nasar to curate the exhibition *Speech Acts: Reflection\-Imagination\-Repetition* \(2018–19, Manchester Art Gallery, funded by the Paul Mellon Centre. GBP9,462.99\) as a response to the BAM project. The exhibition juxtaposed works by canonical white British artists with those by artists of Asian and African heritage, rather than presenting a selection based on the heritage of the artists. *Speech Acts* inspired a series of workshops and conferences in collaboration with institutions including Contemporary Art Society and Iniva. ‘The LYC Museum & Art Gallery and the Museum as Practice’, a symposium organised by the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art \(PMC\) and UAL, in collaboration with Manchester Art Gallery and the University of Manchester \(with conveners including Nasar and Afterall’s Steeds\), at Manchester Art Gallery \(6–7 March 2019\), considered the LYC Museum as an extension of artist Li Yuan\-chia’s \(1929–1994\) pioneering participatory art practice. The event examined wide\-ranging questions such as: How does the example of LYC sit within wider histories of the museum as artwork? What does the LYC Museum contribute to wider considerations of Participatory Art practices? What forms and methodologies allow art historical enquiries into friendships and sites? \(The practice of Li Yuan\-chia and the LYC Museum were brought into the public domain by the work of BAM, and through the television programme, ‘Whoever Heard of a Black Artist? Britain's Hidden Art history'.\) From *Speech Acts*, a collaborative exhibition is scheduled at Kettle’s Yard, University of Cambridge, bringing the LYC Museum and Kettle’s Yard together in conversation \(2022–2023\). Nasar works with MAG as a consulting curator, advising on the re\-hang of its permanent collection, and is co\-curator of *British Art Show 9* \(with MAG as his nominee\)—one of Britain’s most significant exhibitions of contemporary art organised every five years by Hayward Gallery Touring. 

 Middlesborough Insitute of Modern Art’s \(MIMA\) *Why Are We Here?*, a year\-long collaboration with BAM, through which the collection was audited for all contributions by artists of African, Asian and Middle East and North Africa Region descent in the UK in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, revealed new narratives within the collection. Described as “a huge success for MIMA, prompting serious discussion about who and what should be collected for the public good” \[5.9.\],  the project ran from March 2019 to August 2020, with results of this research unveiled as they are uncovered, making new material available to the institution and its publics. 

 **Goodwin** worked with artist Hannah Collins to curate *We Will Walk—*Art and Resistance in the American South \(Turner Contemporary, 2020\), to reveal the little\-known history of African\-American ‘yard art’, shaped by the Civil Rights period in the 1950s and 1960s. At a time of widespread protest on the streets, *We Will Walk* was the first exhibition of its kind in the UK. A symposium, ‘Art, Roots and The Abstract Truth’ \(March 2020\) and an online discussion, ‘We Will Walk: Black Art, Radical Transformation’ \(July 2020\) unpacked the issues further. A virtual tour of the exhibition has had over 11,000 views on YouTube. **“**The exhibition … articulates Southern\-ness through the lens of a too\-often neglected corpus of African\-American artists. In a genre\-bursting and affecting assemblage of works, co\-curators Hannah Collins and Paul Goodwin have sought to explore how the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and ’60s shaped the work of these artists.” \[5.10.\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Peter’s maritime design history research has underpinned commercial, economic and cultural impacts in countries around the world. It has transformed marketing and sales processes for 4 global shipping companies, enhancing customer confidence and increasing sales. It has also enabled a new approach to stock acquisition for the world’s largest ferry operator, enabling very considerable savings \(estimated at over USD80,000,000\) and encouraging innovation. These benefits have been realised in Denmark, Sweden, China and Japan. In North America and the UK, Peter’s research has stimulated cultural tourism through contributions to major new exhibitions, attracting large audiences, new funding and new revenue through book sales. Finally, Peter’s research has reached global audiences, with 26,000 copies of Peter’s books sold since 2013, generating over GBP1,001,000, and through TV programmes broadcast internationally, attracting audiences of 2,000,000\+. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Academic research on maritime history has traditionally focused on technical design, largely exploring military history, not merchant shipping. Research by GSA’s Professor Bruce Peter has transformed the field by building a new body of work that combines the history of technology with design and business history and cultural studies methods. His approach has created fresh insights into the architectural and technical design, consumer culture and operational contexts of twentieth century passenger ships in British, Danish and international contexts. Through interviews \(with naval architects, interior designers and shipping company managers\) and extensive archival research, the body of work ascertains relationships between the technology, engineering and economy of modern ships and their aestheticisation for public consumption. Peter’s approach is innovative in its application of these methods to analyse the subject equally in terms of the ‘production’ of ships, the ‘consumption’ of their interiors and onboard facilities by users, and their cultural and design contexts in terms of architecture, fashion and other related areas. Comprising mainly monographs, Peter’s research falls into two broad areas: applying his innovative approach to examine particular ships, companies and types of passenger vessel; and investigating the history of ship design through the different lenses. 

 The first of these areas can be illustrated by three key examples. In 2007, Peter explored 70 years of the history and context of the passenger ship design work of Knud E. Hansen \(KEH\), a naval architecture consultancy based in Denmark with clients around the world. Peter’s research develops a new understanding of how a small specialist firm, innovating primarily in ferry and cruise ship design, developed operationally efficient vessels with unprecedented ranges of facilities to attract wider demographics of travellers and generate increased onboard revenue. The research introduces insights into the thoughts of the company's famous ship engineers, including Knud E. Hansen, Tage Wandborg, Dag Rogne and Holger Terpet. \[R1\] Following this research, and working with Canadian maritime historian Philip Dawson, Peter co\-authored *Queen Elizabeth 2: Britain’s Greatest Liner* in 2008, exploring the social and cultural contexts from which the liner emerged and providing an in\-depth view of the design process, from earliest proposals to detailed designs of different iterations of the vessel. Peter looks in detail at how – and why – the world’s most famous ocean liner has been transformed from a futuristic Modernist icon into a 'retro' ship, based upon nostalgia for a lost 'golden age' of inter\-war liner travel. \[R2\] A third example includes Peter’s 2010 design history of the roll\-on, roll\-off \(ro\-ro\) ferry from the mid\-nineteenth century until the present day. *The Ferry: A Drive\-Through History* comprehensively documented for the first time the design origins of the modern ro\-ro and the various international strands of ferry design development, filling a significant gap in the historical record of modern merchant shipping. The work revealed the challenges relating to the compromises between commercial requirements for fast throughput and safety concerns arising from open and undivided vehicle decks. \[R3\] 

 Examples of Peter’s investigation of ship design more broadly include the co\-authored 2006 *Cruise: Identity, Design and Culture*, exploring the design and culture of cruise ships from the interwar period to the present day. Using a cultural studies perspective, Peter’s work examines both interior and exterior design, as well as onboard entertainment and the dining experience. \[R4\] This was followed in 2010 with *Ship Style: Modernism and Modernity at Sea in the 20th Century,* which focused on modern passenger ship design since the 1880s and contained original scholarship on the manifestation of modernism in ships and their interiors, as well as the influence of modern ships on architecture, design and spatial planning ashore. Comparing and contrasting the ways that modernism was interpreted in ship design in various European countries, the USA, Israel and elsewhere was a further innovation. \[R5\] 

 A significant sole\-authored work \(published in English and Danish\) was *Dansk Linjefart*, the first published account of how Denmark became the leading nation in international liner shipping and how Danish liner operators applied innovative technologies, including propulsion and cargo handling efficiency, to gain increased advantage in what is a highly competitive market. The research focused on the technical innovations, business histories and operational contexts of the major shipping lines – DFDS, EAC and Maersk – and involved interviews with leading Danish naval architects, engineers and technical staff who had been involved in the development of Danish owned and built cargo liners and container ships from the 1950s onwards. For this project, A.P. Møller\-Maersk enabled Peter to interview their current senior technical and design staff, which generated unique material, unavailable elsewhere, on the development of the company’s newest container ships. \[R6\]

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Taken together, the research constitutes an authoritative and original body of knowledge documenting and contextualising the development of design of modern merchant ships. This body of knowledge has transformed marketing and sales processes for global shipping companies, enabled a new approach to stock acquisition for the world’s largest ferry operator, stimulated cultural tourism through contributions to major new exhibitions and enhanced public interest and understanding in maritime design. Impact has been global, spanning the UK, North America, Scandinavia, China and Japan. 

####  Transforming marketing and sales processes for global shipping companies 

 Ship design and construction is a costly and competitive activity, representing a considerable financial risk \(USD2,000,000\+\) for clients and investors. Conventional marketing strategies were insufficiently refined in the specificity of technical and contextual information and something else was needed to help companies mitigate the risks. As a result of his research, Peter has been invited by 4 major Danish shipping companies to produce accessible literature to promote technological innovations, products and services to – and build and strengthen relationships with – clientele in international markets. These authoritative works of maritime history scholarship have been able to convey comprehensive knowledge to convince clients who themselves are technical and business experts. Specific examples include: 

-  **Knud E.Hansen** has worked with Peter for over a decade, using his publications as corporate gifts and marketing tools. Since August 2013, KEH has gifted approximately 850 of Peter’s books as part of an enhanced sales process, gaining 28 major commissions for complete designs plus over 900 other commissions from leading European shipowners and major Chinese shipyards, including Jinling Shipyard in Nanjing, for which the company designed ultra\-large ro\-ro ferries for DFDS, Grimaldi Lines and Finnlines. The tendering process included the client providing a score for professional reputation, which the books effectively demonstrated. In 2016 the company commissioned a third book, *Ship Design Through Eight Decades,* to celebrate their 80<sup>th</sup> anniversary and to present as an exclusive corporate gift. As KEH’s Managing Director noted, Peter’s work has helped to ‘strengthen the image of our company and encourage new clients better to understand our background, expertise and key skills’. \[S1\] 

-  **MAN Diesel & Turbo**, since renamed MAN Energy Solutions, a marine engineering firm and propeller licensee, bought 300 copies of Peter’s 2015 book, *The Story of the Kappel Propeller,* which itself was commissioned by the Technical University of Denmark and provides a comprehensive understanding of what lead to the development of this innovative propeller type. Senior Manager Jens Ring Neilsen has said that MAN includes the book as part of their general promotion of the product, as it ‘accurately informs … potential customers about the lengthy, complex and precise research processes through which the Kappel propeller was developed’ and ‘allows clients to feel knowledgeable about the propeller’s background and thereby makes them feel more confident about its effectiveness’. Prior to using the book as a sales tool, the company sold 50 propellers in 13 years \(2003\-2017\). Since including the book in its sales strategy, sales have increased exponentially, with 70 propellers selling in a 3\-year period \(2017\-2019\) \[S2\] 

-  In late 2013, **A.P. Møller\-Maersk**, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, commissioned an expanded English\-language version of Peter’s book *Dansk Linjefart*, which featured Maersk ships, translated as *Danish Liners Around the World* \(2014\) and used by Maersk as corporate gifts. Henning Morgen, Maersk Group Historian, describes the value of Peter’s research as ‘useable and credible in the production of postings on social media, reaching a global audience that includes… employees, clients and other stakeholders’, helping ‘in particular… to foster better customer relations’ and enabling ‘large numbers of people to develop knowledge about our background and values’. Maersk social media reaches the company’s 80,000 employees in 130 countries and 3,075,000\+ customers, stakeholders and followers. \[S3\] 

-  Another major Danish shipping company, **DFDS**, commissioned a substantial book, *DFDS 150* \(Lyngby: Polyteknisk Forlag, 2016\) for their 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary, and bought large numbers of copies to use as corporate gifts. \[S4\] According to Gert Jakobsen, Vice President Communications at DFDS, the book is ‘the DFDS Group’s point of reference as regards the company’s history and is widely used in all 21 countries in which DFDS is represented, from Norway to Turkey, from Ireland and the UK to the Baltic countries … It forms the basis from which daily answers to questions and requests from the public, individuals, media, learning institutes or politics are answered’ and ‘has supplied and continues to supply historical information used in our communications via social media’ which reaches over 18,000 people.’ 

####  Enabling a new approach to stock acquisition for Stena Ro\-Ro 

 Peter’s co\-written book with Japanese maritime historian Tsuyoshi Ishiyama, *Japanese Ferries,* formed the basis for a presentation on Japanese ferries, their design, and the Japanese domestic ferry market at the 2013 ShipPax Ferry Shipping Conference, attended by shipping professionals from around the world. A presentation led to an invitation by the world’s largest ferry owner \(by gross tonnage and freight capacity\) **Stena Ro\-Ro**, to present to its senior managers, commercial and technical staff at its headquarters in Gothenburg in December 2013. The Sales & Purchase Manager at Stena Ro\-Ro has described this presentation as ‘opening the door to something which has given us new experience and new challenges’, resulting in the decision to purchase a second hand ferry from Japan. Peter’s research was the catalyst for this new approach to stock acquisition, enabling both the acquisition of this ship for Stena RoRo and the ship sale for its Japanese owner in 2019. Shipbrokers specialising in ferry sale and purchase estimate the ferry’s value at approximately USD12,000,000. An equivalent ferry, bought new, would cost over USD100,000,000, thereby saving Stena RoRo over USD80,000,000, relative to building equivalent new tonnage. \[S5\] 

  

####  Stimulating cultural tourism and enhancing major new exhibitions 

 Peter was commissioned by the new **Danish national maritime museum, Museet for Søfart** to write the official book about its site and context, the design of the new building \(by the leading Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, costing DKK330,000,000\), and its permanent displays. Publication of the book coincided with the opening of the new museum in October 2013. 5,000 copies of the book were produced by the leading Swedish architectural publisher Arvinius\+ Orfeus in Danish and English editions entitled respectively *Museet i Dokken* and *The Museum in the Dock,* for sale to museum visitors and as a corporate gifts. The museum’s architects also purchased 200 copies of the book which they use as part of their marketing strategy for the international showcasing of their practice and, as Bjarke Ingels’ architect David Zahle states, ‘to gain fresh commissions.’ As the Chairman and CEO of ‘Maritim Museums Byg Aps’, a body established for fundraising and managing the construction of the new museum, has said, ‘the publication of the book has greatly helped to put the project on the world map.’ \[S6\] 

 In 2017 Peter was invited by **Victoria & Albert Museum** senior curator, Ghislaine Wood \(now Acting Director, Sainsbury Centre\), and her American colleague Daniel Finamore \(Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, MA\) to act as expert consultant on a major international touring exhibition, *Ocean Liners: Speed and Style*. For Wood, Peter’s books on ocean liners, *Ship Style* and *Cruise: Identity, Design and Culture,* ‘were an important source of inspiration and knowledge’ which led to the invitation to participate. The exhibition used themes and case\-studies derived from Peter’s books and he contributed two chapters to the exhibition catalogue. 16,500 copies of the catalogue were produced and the exhibition was seen by over 500,000 visitors in Salem, London and Dundee, generating substantial revenues for the 3 venues. For the V&A, this is a significant outcome when compared against their benchmark of success \(the ‘David Bowie Is,’ exhibition \(2013\-18\), shown at eleven venues and attracting 2,000,000 visitors\). As the exhibition’s curator notes, ‘As the inaugural show of V&A Dundee, it was at the centre of the £80million regeneration programme … Visitor feedback confirmed that the exhibition was successful in enhancing their understanding of the design and cultural impact of the ocean liner \(97%\) and how it had inspired artists, designers and filmmakers \(96.6%\), as well as capturing a sense of life on board an ocean liner \(95%\).’ For 67% of visitors, it was their sole or main reason for visiting Dundee. \[S7\] 

 The exhibition has also led to ‘significant tangible benefits’ for the **Peabody Essex Museum** \(PEM\), its initial host. Finamore, the museum’s Associate Director, has identified Peter’s contribution to enhancing public awareness of the subject, reaching larger audiences, preserving maritime art and artefacts, and improving the museum’s professional profile amongst leaders in the field, including maritime scholars and collectors. Since the *Ocean Liners* exhibition, the Peabody has received 7 offers of significant collections, 2 of which they have accepted, and attracted the involvement of prominent American collectors and their families. *Ocean Liners* also enabled the museum to establish a new relationship with a major regional bank, who became a USD100,000\+ sponsor of the exhibition and are now poised to sponsor a second show scheduled for 2021. Finally, the exhibition has significantly increased outreach, including 140 placements in print media, yielding circulation of 7,650,356; mention in 40 known blogs; and 591 mentions in social media with a potential reach of 6,200,000 views. As Finamore has stated, ‘the impact of our exhibition and book project on PEM was among the most effective we have undertaken, and our consultations with Bruce Peter helped assure the impact and overall success of this project.’ \[S8\] 

 Following his contribution to *Ocean Liners,* Peter was commissioned by Wood to write two chapters for the monograph accompanying her next major exhibition *Art Deco by the Sea*, inaugurated at the **Sainsbury Centre for the Arts in Norwich** in 2020 and, like *Ocean Liners*, intended to generate knowledge and to achieve economic impact. Covid\-19 has prevented these objectives from being realised as anticipated; however, the exhibition had attracted 15,000 visitors by late\-November 2020 and expanded its national and international reach through its selection for the BBC’s *Culture in Quarantine* series. Wood describes this as ‘the most significant showing of Art Deco in Britain since the Thirties exhibition at the Hayward in 1976’ and states that Peter’s ‘great empirical knowledge of architectural history and the histories of transport were a vital part of the project.’ \[S7\] 

####  Enhacing public interest and understanding in maritime design 

 Peter has enabled the expansion of public knowledge of maritime design history, reaching large popular audiences through his role as expert contributor to TV programmes for major UK broadcasters: *Queen Mary: Greatest Ocean Liner* \(Scottish Television for BBC 2, 2016\); *Great British Royal Ships: Her Majesty’s Yacht Britannia* \(Channel 5, 2017, 1,000,000\+ viewers\); and *QE2: The World’s Greatest Cruise Ship* \(Channel 5, 2018, 1,000,000\+ viewers\). The programmes were subsequently re\-sold internationally by Channel 5’s parent company, Viacom, and have been viewed in much of Europe and the USA \(via PBS\). Programmes made in recent years add to a suite of earlier shows that continue to be broadcast, generating economic activity through programme\-making and sales and through accompanying commercial advertising slots. Approximately 25,000 copies of Peter’s books published since 2013 have been sold around the world, generating over GBP1,001,000. \[S9\] As well as public programmes, Peter was also invited by the Dorchester Hotel Group – operating nine luxury hotels in the UK, Italy, France and the USA – to record one of eight interviews with the art collector and curator Cathy Wills, based on his contributions to the *Ocean Liners* and *Art Deco by the Sea* exhibitions. The interviews were sent to 17,000 global clients of the Dorchester group to raise brand awareness, and made available on the Dorchester’s website. \[S10\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Kalganova’s research on Ant Colony Optimisation \(ACO\) has had significant impacts on the business performance, profitability and strategic planning of Caterpillar Inc., an American Fortune 100 corporation. Her work has been fully embedded in their network modelling and optimisation solutions, GEMSTONE, in November 2016 and has been used to design the logistics to manage supply chains for every Caterpillar product and component globally since then. This involves over 3,000,000 individual products and approximately 700,000 service parts globally. In the UK alone, GEMSTONE supports more than 7,000 employees and 30 production facilities that distribute products worldwide. Dr Kalganova’s research has enabled GEMSTONE to constantly optimise their entire supply chain as well as their operations in near real\-time \(every 32 minutes\). As it dramatically improves the supply network performance, GEMSTONE has delivered a significant reduction in transportation costs and transport time, contributing to the reduction of the company’s overall environmental footprint since 2016. 

 \[text removed for publication\] 

 GEMSTONE is also used to deal with orchestrating their responses to emergencies \(whether due to natural disasters or disruptions like fire\) and to develop scenario\-planning and analyse the impact of plausible futures \(e.g. Brexit\), reducing its modelling and reconfiguring total time of global supply chains to 24 hours from 2.5 weeks. This means Caterpillar has complete control over any situations and responds in a way that would ensure timely and profitable logistic solutions.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Kalganova specialises in optimisation of supply chains through the development of agile algorithms which gradually increase its capability of handling and optimising the complexity of BIG Data in the shortest possible computational time without compromising the quality of solutions. Since 2010, Dr Kalganova \(then Lecturer\) and Caterpillar’s Global Technology team have been working to find a software solution that could scale up to the size of Caterpillar’s network and deliver the most efficient supply network system. Unlike commercial software which typically is limited to about 1,000 connections between nodes represented by fixed transportation rates and transport times, a typical Caterpillar model has over 400,000,000,000,000,000 \(400 quadrillion\) connections that must be represented stochastically for each product. 

 Dr Kalganova and her team demonstrated the superior behaviour of evolutionary strategy and Cartesian genetic programming, while being selected as a Finalist of demand strategy competition organised by Research and Innovation, Caterpillar Inc. in 2011\-2012. 

 Subsequently, they have worked in collaboration to investigate the dynamics of more than 20 algorithms in order to sustain the quality of the solution while gradually increasing the dimensions of the optimisation. This resulted in the development of the hybrid supply chain modelling and optimisation. 

 In 2013\-2014, through research funded by Caterpillar Inc, Dr Kalganova’s team, in collaboration with research teams from Caterpillar and Bradley University, demonstrated that the evolutionary strategy applied to supply chain modelling is capable of discovering the solutions from the wide search space. The academic team demonstrated that the existing algorithms developed within the scope of transportation network optimisation are applied to significantly lower complexity problems in terms of number of nodes and edges used in comparison with the existing size of Caterpillar’s supply chain network \[Ref 1\]. The systemic investigation into multi\-objective algorithms demonstrated that the proposed superposition method significantly outperformed goal syntheses \[Ref 2\]. The results of the research led to the development of supply network optimisation method and system for multiple objectives, improving profit, service level and network resilience. In order to decrease the computational algorithmic effort, prediction of best termination condition has been developed and integrated into ant colony optimisation \[Ref 3\]. The method and system for managing supply chain networks with multiple supply layers included the development of the algorithmic foundation supporting multilayers. The strategies for mapping algorithmic structure into the hardware architecture has been proposed and investigated in depth \[Ref 4\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dr Kalganova’s research on Ant Colony Optimisation \(ACO\) has led to significant economic impact. Her work has been fully embedded in the network modelling and optimisation solutions of Caterpillar Inc by November 2016 under the new name GEMSTONE \(Generation and Evaluation of Manufacturing, Supply and Transportation Optimisation for Networks technology\). GEMSTONE has been used globally to produce and deliver every Caterpillar product and component through constantly optimising and reconfiguring its entire global and local networks, maximising Caterpillar's profitability and network resilience without compromising service\-level. 

 <ins> **Impact on Business Performance and Profitability**</ins> 

 \[text removed for publication\] 

 This involves more than 3,000,000 individual products and approximately 700,000 service parts. Approximately over 3,000 suppliers, 600 carriers, 100 facilities in over 20 countries, 4,500 transportation lanes and 3,000 dealer\-owned facilities operate within the global supply chain of Caterpillar. In the UK alone, GEMSTONE supports more than 7,000 employees and 30 production facilities that make products that are distributed worldwide. 

 Dr Kalganova’s research contribution to GEMSTONE has been ‘ *fundamental*’ to Caterpillar’s profitability: it provides Caterpillar with an almost real\-time optimisation, by helping how to optimise its supply chain from materials to a global network of suppliers, assembly locations, dealers and customers to maximise their profits. This proactive response gives a strategic advantage which has led to ‘substantial improvements in both profitability and network resilience’ \[E1\].

 <ins> **Reducing Environmental Footprints**</ins> 

 Carrying more than 90% of the world's trade, ships are responsible for 3% of greenhouse\-gas emissions \(equivalent to 1,000,000,000t\). By burning heavy fuel oil, just 15 of the largest ships emit more of the noxious NOx than all the world’s cars put together, making it a major source of air pollution. \(Economist, 11 Mar 2017\) 

 Given the size of Caterpillar, which relies heavily on maritime transports, its significant reduction in transport time within the global supply chain, achieved by GEMSTONE, means that it was able to reduce its CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions as it is directly correlated to the transportation time/distance and the mode of transportation has not been changed. \[E3\] Although it is difficult to calculate the direct contributions to reducing its environmental footprint from GEMSTONE, Caterpillar was able to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions intensity since 2016: from 54.2 in 2016 to 46.4 in 2017, 40.4 in 2018 and 33 in 2019 \(in metric tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e per million dollars of revenue\). \(E6\) 

 <ins> **Impact on Business Strategy**</ins> 

 The scale of profitability is possible because GEMSTONE can orchestrate its response to emergency and scenarios by reconfiguring networks in 24 hours. This means Caterpillar has complete control over any situations and responds in a way that would ensure timely and profitable logistic solutions. 

 Compared to 2011 when it took Caterpillar 2.5 weeks to assess the impact of Tsunami, in 2018 when Brexit was voted for, Caterpillar managed to model, optimise and reconfigure the overall global supply chain in 24 hours. \[E4\] 

 GEMSTONE has been used to estimate costs for various scenario modelling for Caterpillar Inc., and was immediately employed after the referendum in the UK in 2016 to assess the impact of Brexit, directly influencing their strategic management decisions. In 2018, a representative from Caterpillar acknowledged that “ *The supply chain modelling technology integrated into Caterpillar business process developed by Brunel,…helped to analyse, model, optimise and implement the global supply chain within 24 hours from the Brexit vote happening.”* \[E5\] 

 This successful university\-industry partnership was globally acknowledged by achieving Global Excellence in Analytics Award from the International Institute of Analytics in 2016 as well as being named one of the Top 3 2017 Global Innovative Applications in Analytics by INFORMS \(The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences\). Both awards recognise organisations’ dedication to using analytics to improve business results.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Rees Centre research on Children Looked After \(CLA\) in 2015 identified factors contributing to poor educational outcomes of those supported by children’s services in the UK. The Department for Education \(DfE\) changed their Annual Statistical Release on outcomes for CLA in 2016 in response to the Rees Centre’s CLA research recommendations. A year later, Ofsted’s inspection framework for schools, and social care inspections, extended their focus on CLA and introduced education inspectors on social care inspections and vice versa. Informed by the Centre’s research, some local authorities \(LAs\), including Barking and Dagenham, Salford, Staffordshire and Suffolk, changed their policies on CLA moving schools and increased resources to Pupil Referral Units. Internationally, Australia’s largest fostering provider also changed its policies and practice in 2017 informed by this research.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Rees Centre in the Department of Education, University of Oxford, conducts research that aims to improve the education, well\-being and life outcomes of those who are, or have been, supported by children’s social care services. The Oxford\-led “The Educational Progress of Looked After Children in England: Linking Care and Educational Data” study **\[R1\]** \(in collaboration with University of Bristol\) was the first research to link education and care factors statistically and complement this with interviews of secondary\-aged CLA in England. Oxford\-led on the quantitative analysis of DfE datasets on CLA and the National Pupil Database \(NPD\) \(Luke, Strand, Fletcher\) and contributed to the qualitative interviews that complemented this work \(Sebba, foster carers and care leaver interviews\). The main findings and associated recommendations that underpinned impact were published in November 2015 and in a series of papers **\[R2, R3, R4, R5, R6\]**. Recommendations included: 

 **F1** Children in longer\-term care do better than those ‘in need’ \(children with a social worker but not in care\), or those in short term care. Children in need provide an additional, and more suitable, comparison group than the general child population for children in care in official statistics and public debate **\[R6\].** 

 **F2** Some young people in care with lower prior attainment subsequently made very good progress academically. A focus on progress, rather than attainment only, gives a more realistic depiction of the achievements of CLA **\[R6\]**. 

 **F3** Each change of care placement age 11\+ is associated with one\-third of a grade less at GCSE, and young people in care who changed school in Years 10 or 11 scored over five grades less than those who did not. Local authorities should ensure that school staff provide appropriate support \(partly through the Virtual School who has responsibility for the progress of CLA\), and limit placement and school changes, in KS4 **\[R5\]**. 

 **F4** CLA’s unauthorised absences and fixed\-term exclusions are associated with poorer GCSEs. Initiatives to support pupils with social, emotional and mental health difficulties need to become more widely implemented to address the attendance and exclusions of CLA **\[R1\].** 

 **F5** Young people in special schools or Pupil Referral Units \(PRUs\) at 16 scored 14 grades lower in GCSEs compared to those with the same characteristics in mainstream schools. Local authorities should admit CLA to high performing mainstream schools \[the report implied rather than stated that there should be a preference for mainstream\] where possible and better equip special schools/PRUs to support CLA’s progress **\[R1\]**. 

 **F6** Children whose final placement was in foster or kinship care scored six GCSE grades better than those in residential care. Local authorities should prioritise foster/kinship placements and address educational improvement across the workforce in residential settings **\[R1\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The findings and recommendations were disseminated through distribution of over 3,000 copies of the report **\[R1\]** to policy makers, Local Authorities \(LAs\), children’s services managers and practitioners, and internationally \(in particular in Japan and Australia\). Multiple face\-to\-face briefings were given to DfE senior officials and the Association of Directors of Children’s Services \(ADCS\), and workshop sessions were held in 2016 with over 1,500 Ofsted inspectors and over 100 Virtual School Heads \(VSH, 120 in total in England tasked with enhancing/supporting the education of CLA\) across the nine local government regions. Impact from the research won 1st Prize in the University of Bristol Vice Chancellor’s impact award November 2016 and was Highly Commended in the Excellence in Impact Awards, University of Oxford, 2018. 

###  Impact on National Policy 

 Changes were made to the DfE Statistical First Release of Outcomes of CLA, published March 2016, which for the first time compared CLA to children in need in response to **F1 in R1 \[S2, pp.4\-9\]** and increased the reporting of progress in line with the report’s recommendations **\[R1\]**. The then Government Children’s Minister urged every LA to implement the recommendations: 

 ‘*…this research* **\[R1\]** *helps us in thinking about how we can make progress…: DfE officials have already* …\[started\] *exploring how we can use data better to help us drive and measure the attainment of children in care in the future, and identify collective action that will promote their achievements at school. …it may be more useful to use the progress of looked\-after children, relative to those with the same prior attainment* **\[F1, which led to S2\]** *, as a measure of the effectiveness of care rather than solely using absolute attainment’* **\[S1\]**. 

 Parliament debated the report **\[R1\]** findings in January 2016. Giving preference to foster care over residential care because of the better associated educational outcomes **\[R1\]** was raised by The Education Select Committee in a debate on CLA in the Commons. Alan Johnson cited the report in his arguments on the need to give preference to foster care: ‘… *the latest piece of research, from last November, states that those children* \[in kinship/foster care\] *also do better in educational attainment than those in residential care’* **\[F6\]**, **\[S3a\]**. 

 Reducing school changes was highlighted in The Education Select Committee Fostering Inquiry, to which Sebba gave oral evidence in April 2017 **\[S3b, Q157\-167\]**. The inquiry report references the research and the subsequent debate on the inquiry stated: *‘Research on the educational progress of looked\-after children has found that educational placement changes are a significant risk factor  \[F3\]  for the educational outcomes for children in care…* **’ \[S3c\]**. In response to this report, the government stressed the importance of stability for CLA: *the number of moves of placement, social worker or school must be kept to an absolute minimum’* **\[S3d, p.21\]**. 

 A commitment not to place children far from home and to review the education of children in need was made in the 2017 Conservative Party manifesto in which two references are made to the findings \(while not mentioning the research explicitly, **R1** was the only research on these two issues at that time\): ‘ *We will ensure that councils provide consistency of care  \[F3\]  and cannot relocate vulnerable children far from their home when it is not in their best interests to do so. We will review support for Children in Need* **\[F1\]** *to understand why their outcomes are so poor and what more support they might require, in and out of school*.’ **\[S4, p.73\]**. The Conservative Party review team met with the research team five times \(a small invited workshop, an online seminar and three briefings, as well as numerous email exchanges\), and published its report in June 2019 **\[S4, p.8\]** which, it stated: *‘…take*\[s\] *account of academic evidence and research, including…joint work with the University of Oxford’s Rees Centre* **\[R5, R6\]** *’.* In 2020, this led to a proposal by the DfE in its 2019 Children in Need review, which cites **R1** as key to its research underpinning in its introduction, that Virtual Schools take responsibility for supporting the education of children in need **\[S5, pp.8 & 37\]**. 

  

###  Impact on Ofsted inspection 

 Changes to the Ofsted inspection framework guidance for children’s services \(published in 2017, amended in 2019 and 2020\) **\[S7a\]** were made that reflected the research recommendations **\[R1, R2, R3\]**. The 2016 Chief Inspector’s Annual Report on Children’s Social Care **\[S6, pp. 8 & 53\],** had referenced the research, noting the specific findings on children doing better in care than in need, the use of the latter as a comparator **\[F1\]** and the high proportion not in mainstream schools and thereby at risk of poorer outcomes **\[F5\]**. The Ofsted National Director for Social Care published a blog summarising Ofsted’s changing approach in response to the research **\[S7c\]**, while the lead Ofsted manager for children in care commented **\[S7b\]**: *‘We have taken the research findings into careful account during the development of our new frameworks for inspections of local authority children’s services \(ILACS\) and regulated services under the* *SCCIF* *\(Social Care Common Inspection Framework\). …an educational inspector alongside social care colleagues during local authority inspections* **\[introduced in response to overall findings, S7a\]** *will help us to look more closely and accurately at educational progress children make and how this is affected by their care* **\[F1\]** *.* *…The criteria and methodology … place a greater emphasis on evaluating the educational progress of individual children from their starting points* **\[F1\]** *and less on the overall gap between the children in care cohort and their peers. The framework’s strong emphasis on the importance of good decision\-making and achievement of timely permanence reflect the* \[research\] *findings related to the age of entry into care and overall stability for children…* **\[F3\]’** 

###  National Bodies and Local Authorities 

 A new national dataset **\[S9\]** for LAs to better monitor the progress of looked after children **\[F1, F2\]**, linking education and social care data has led to improved decision\-making and potentially improved educational outcomes for CLA \(a causal link cannot be proved\). This was commissioned in late 2015 by the ADCS and National Association of VSHs \(NAVSH\). Their published response stated **\[S8\]**: *‘Building on evidence from recent research carried out by the Rees Centre at the University of Oxford and the University of Bristol* **\[R1\]** *, …ADCS working with the Virtual School Heads Network and the National Consortium for Examination Results* \[NCER\] *, wants to stimulate a national debate about improving support and ambition for children in care, and, through that, to improve educational outcomes and life chances for all children in care.’* 

 Three actions were proposed: developing a new dataset to help LAs **\[S9\]**, informing the new Ofsted framework **\[S7a\]** and challenging national policy so LAs can ensure that CLA have access to the best educational placements \[F3, F5, S12\]**. From April 2019 to March 2020, 30,769 reports were run using the dataset by 150 \(all but two\) LAs. In 2020, Suffolk VSH stated **\[S10a\]**: ‘ *The NCER dataset and toolkit has helped us to understand the specific context of CLA outcomes …through monitoring much more robustly what is actually happening. This has informed important decisions about priorities in allocation of scarce resources. Analysis of our results compared to national data, identified three problems: poor performance of CLA with special educational needs and disabilities, high scores \(indicators of high levels of behaviour problems\) on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire \(SDQ, collected nationally\) correlating with poor outcomes, and too many CLA leaving school without qualifications. We targeted better support in each of these areas and have been able to monitor the following: an increase in CLA who gain any qualification, though cannot claim causation due to small cohorts; The capture and sharing of best practice where schools are achieving good outcomes for children with concerning SDQ scores; and better progress in children identified as having SEND support than non\-looked after children in Suffolk schools.’* 

 Minimising school moves in line with the research recommendations **\[R1\]** has been reported by individual LAs. For example, the VSH in Staffordshire stated: ‘ *The social worker requested for pupil to move to school closer to his current placement…Pupil’s current school is 20\-minute drive from the foster placement, he is making excellent progress at his current school... Research* **\[R1\]** *clearly evidences the impact of school moves upon a child’s educational progress and attainment* **\[F3\] **,** there is a commitment \[now\] to minimising school moves. Decision: A school move is not agreed…’* **\[S10b\]**. 

 Decisions about budget allocations, managed moves and exclusions **\[F3, F4\]** have been influenced by the research in other LAs. For example, the VSH in Salford stated: ‘ *…in allocating the 2016\-17 centrally retained PPP budget of c.£350,000 we have given greater priority to the 'segregated’ 40%. The report brought home the need to devote even further energy and resources to those in children's homes* **\[F6\],** *in non\-mainstream schools* **\[F5\]…** *we continue to challenge managed moves* **\[F3\]** *and fixed term exclusions* **\[F4\]** *but with greater vigour’* **\[S10d\]** A Virtual School Advisory Teacher, Barking and Dagenham reported: ‘ *I have used the report …to inform Social Workers and IROs* \[Independent Reviewing Officers\] *about the importance of keeping a LAC* \[Looked After Child\] *in the same school* **\[F3\]** *when placement move becomes an issue. Also, findings have informed …LAC at risk of exclusion* **\[F4\].** *In particular,* \[the finding that\] *mainstream schools reporting higher GCSE results compared with those LAC who were educated in Alternative Provision* **\[F5\]** *… provides evidence to encourage mainstream schools to keep the excluded LAC at the school with a support package.…research has been helpful in working out how best to use the Pupil Premium grant* **\[relevant findings reported in R5\]**.’ **\[S10c\]** 

###  International Impact: Australia 

 Extending the research into an international context, Sebba gave a keynote speech in 2016, which drew heavily on **R1**, at the Association of Child Welfare Agencies Annual Conference. Following this she had meetings with a number of officials including the New South Wales Minister for Family and Community Services, The Association of Child Welfare Agencies and Life Without Barriers, a major fostering provider for 3000 young people, reviewed their education policies for children in out\-of\-home care in 2017\-18. The Director of Life Without Barriers, who commissioned Sebba to run workshops for staff, stated **\[S11\]**: ‘ *Research on the educational progress* **\[R2, R4\]** *influenced our work as we re\-designed our foster care approach... in particular the findings related to time in care \(that care is a protective factor in education\)* **\[F1\]** *and school absence* **\[F4\]** *.’* Sebba also briefed South Australia’s Minister for Child Protection and her delegation in May 2019 in London, which has been used in their evolving policy for out\-of\-home care.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prof Fuchs’ research on digital media and society has had significant impact on the **Speaker’s Commission on Digital Democracy** and Austria’s public service broadcaster ORF \( **Austrian Broadcasting Corporation**\): 

-  Fuchs’ research\-based knowledge informed the Speaker’s Commission on Digital Democracy, set up by the UK Parliament to investigate how **digital democracy** can be strengthened. 

-  Fuchs’ contribution to the Speaker’s Commission advanced policy thinking concerning the **enhancement of citizen engagement with parliament** through the use of digital media, which has influenced the **Parliamentary Digital Strategy** and has fostered **greater participation from citizens in UK democracy** and parliamentary matters. 

-  Fuchs’ research\-based consultancy work for ORF informed the latter’s policy position on the question of **taxing digital giants such as Google and Facebook**, which is of particular relevance in **Austria**, where in late 2019 a **law taxing online advertising at 5%** was passed that helps public service media to compete against digital monopolies by limiting the financial power of the digital giants. 

-  Fuchs’ research\-based consultancy work for ORF informed the latter’s stress on the need for the **development of public service broadcasting into digital public service platforms** that ORF advocates in its strategy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prof Fuchs is Director of the Communication and Media Research Institute \(CAMRI\) at the University of Westminster. Fuchs’ research agenda has renewed CAMRI’s long tradition in the political economy of communication, also known as the ‘Westminster School’, by developing **a distinct approach to the political economy of digital media**. 

 Fuchs conceptualises the digital public sphere as an online democratic space for political communication \[1, 2\]. As such, it consists of both a technological infrastructure \(form\) and social relations / interactions \(content\). The form of **the digital public sphere** constitutes a political economy \(resources, infrastructure, aspects of production and governance\) and its content constitutes a culture. 

 Drawing on and updating Jürgen Habermas’ theory of the public sphere, Fuchs has analysed **the colonisation of the public sphere and the limitations of its democratic character in the digital age**. He has identified and conceptualised two particular problems: 

 1\) Democracy in general, and digital democracy in particular, is threatened by online nationalism and authoritarianism \[4\], online tabloidisation \[4\], fake news \[4\], the acceleration of communication \[4\], and digital surveillance \[1\]. 

 2\) Digital capitalism’s commercial online culture \[1, 2, 3\] stands as a high\-risk economy that poses various challenges and dangers to society, citizens, and the broader public / common good. 

 Fuchs’ research has shown how the two problems converge within a digital landscape that is dominated by large transnational monopoly corporations such as Alphabet/Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Tencent, and Amazon \[1, 3\]. The survival of **media aimed at the public good is threatened by the audience reach of these digital monopolies**, which is facilitated by their economic dominance and tax avoidance strategies \[2\]. These commercial interests feed into the **ideological bias exhibited by digital monopolies** and their **exploitation of user’s digital labour**. A term coined by Fuchs, digital labour is the value\-generating work in the digital economy. Targeted online advertising is based on the production of personal data and Big Data by users \(their digital labour\), which online companies then trade as a commodity \[4\]. Taken together, such commercial interests thus create the broader threats of a digital authoritarianism, privacy violations, and digital surveillance. 

 Fuchs has suggested two dimensions for advancing the digital public sphere in the face of these problems: 

 1\) Digital authoritarianism can best be overcome by **fostering deliberative and participatory versions of digital democracy** \[1, 4\]. 

 2\) Digital monopolies are best challenged by the establishment of a **public service Internet** and **public service, community\-based, and not\-for\-profit Internet platforms** and the proper taxation of digital capital \[1, 2, 4\]. 

 In order to push forward these strategies and to strengthen the democratic character of the digital public sphere, Fuchs has consistently engaged with public institutions and civil society, as recounted below.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Prof Fuchs’ research has had a significant **impact on the digital public sphere through the strengthening of its democratic character** in respect to the two aforementioned challenges. 

1.  **Advancing digital democracy**: the Speaker’s Commission on Digital Democracy adopted Fuchs’ recommendations regarding public participation within the parliamentary process in the UK and the strategy of engaging citizens in parliamentary democracy through the digital technologies they use on a regular basis \(e.g. non\-governmental social media platforms\). 

1.  **Advancing a public service Internet**: Fuchs has advised Austria’s public service broadcaster – the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation \(ORF\) – on how to tax online advertising and develop a public service Internet. 

#  1\) Impact on the UK Parliament and the Speaker’s Commission on Digital Democracy: 

 In 2014, the then Speaker of the House of Commons, the Rt Hon John Bercow MP, founded the Speaker’s Commission on Digital Democracy. The Commission inquired into how digital media technologies could be harnessed to strengthen digital democracy and to open up the workings of parliament to citizens. 

 On invitation of the Speaker, Prof Fuchs, together with Dr Anastasia Kavada \(CAMRI\) and in co\-operation with colleagues from the University of Westminster’s Centre for the Study of Democracy, contributed to the inquiry by participating in a roundtable in Parliament \[A1\]. Fuchs also submitted written evidence that proposed an update to Prime Minister’s Questions \(PMQs\) that would strengthen digital democracy and further advance the digital public sphere itself. He stressed the importance of finding ways to ‘strengthen citizen participation in digital democracy’ and to ‘engage citizens in parliamentary democracy and parliamentary communication’ \[A2\]. 

 The subsequent *Open Up\! Report of the Speaker’s Commission on Digital Democracy* \(2015\), made 35 recommendations to the House of Commons and the UK Parliament that were grouped under five themes \[A3\]. The Report explicitly mentions and acknowledges the importance of Fuchs’ recommendation that Parliament should connect ‘with people in the digital spaces where they spend their time’ \[A3, p. 27\] and the recommendation that the House of Commons should use digital technologies to ‘experiment with new ways of enabling the public to put forward questions for ministers’ \[A3, p. 46\]. 

 In a corroborating letter \[A4\], the former **Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow** confirms the vital impact of Prof Fuchs’ research on the Speakers’ Commission for Digital Democracy: ‘One of the themes of the roundtable and Prof Fuchs’ written evidence was the need for Parliament to get better at ‘going to where people are’ to engage with them, by connecting with people in the digital spaces where they spend their time and in the way they like to connect. This was adopted by the Commission as one of the key themes in its report. \[…\] Prof Fuchs’ ideas for encouraging greater public involvement in the parliamentary process were also referenced in the report. \[…\] I would like to acknowledge the important input that Prof Fuchs made to the Digital Democracy Commission, based on his research, which informed its work and its report’ \[A4\]. 

 Most significantly, the **Parliamentary Digital Service \(PDS\) was launched** in April 2015 in response to the Speaker’s Commissions Report \[A5a, A5b\]. PDS has combined the work of the Parliamentary Information Communication Technology \(PICT\) and the Web and Intranet Service \(WIS\) teams and is mandated with the ‘responsib\[ility\] for the strategic direction of Parliament’s digital offering and the delivery and management of parliamentary digital platforms, including the website’ \[A5a\]. 

 Asked about the recommendations of the Speaker’s Digital Democracy Commission \[DDC\], in January 2016, a coordinator of PDS confirmed that ‘a strategy that we have \[been\] developing \[has\] a commitment to deliver a number of those actions. So we are leading that in so that **the DDC recommendations become part of our digital strategy**’ \[A5c, p. 233\]. Asked about the ways in which this strategy could **improve democracy**, the coordinator responded: ‘a big one is by transparency and opening up Parliament so it is visible and much easier to understand. And making people aware of how they can engage and giving them opportunities to do that. But doing it in a way that meets their need where they are’ \[A5c, p. 234\]. As such one of the 8 key principles of **the strategy devised by PDS was, as recommended by Prof Fuchs, to ‘Be where people are’** \[A6\]. 

 In this connection, and as explained in posts grouped under that specific principle, PDS created the ‘UK Parliament’s first ever Facebook strategy’ \[A7\], and a YouTube strategy that encompassed ‘ways to deepen engagement with our subscribers and viewers through comments, polls, and interactive live broadcasts’, which was enacted through YouTube’s ‘Community’ function \[A7\]. The success of this strategy is such that **Parliamentary channels have successfully engaged social media users**. Parliament’s Twitter\-channel increased its number of followers from 404k on 1 January 2015 to 1.55mn on 29 June 2020 \[A8\], and also increased the number of ‘Likes’ of its Facebook channel from 116,396 on 1 January 2015 to 383,849 on 13 January 2020 \[A9\]. In early 2019, Parliament’s YouTube channel reached 100,000 followers and more than 20m total views, of which more than 6m occurred in 2018 \[A10\]. In 2016, Parliament launched an Instagram channel in order to further engage with the public; this channel has more than 130,000 followers as of 29 June 2020 \[A11\]. 

 As such, this key aspect of the Parliamentary Digital Strategy, which followed Fuchs’ recommendations on engaging users within their preferred digital spaces, has **achieved greater participation from citizens in UK democracy** and parliamentary matters. 

#  2\) Impact on the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation \(ORF\): 

 Prof Fuchs’ research has also informed the policies of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation \(ORF\) in regard to their idea of **introducing a tax on online advertising** and the idea to **use this tax for funding public service Internet platforms**. 

 ORF is Austria’s public service broadcaster and is committed to advancing the public value of public service media. In 2017, ORF commissioned Fuchs, Dr Josef Baum \(University of Vienna\), and Prof Clemens Thiele \(University of Salzburg\) to undertake a feasibility study on online advertising taxation in the context of Austria. 

 Fuchs’ chapter of the study draws on his theory of digital labour \[B1\]. Given that the national location of users can be identified via their IP addresses every time they click on or view an online ad, it is possible to determine the value generated through online advertising in a specific national jurisdiction. This income can thus be taxed in the country where it was produced, and Fuchs’ theory of digital labour provides a legal basis for doing so. Given that Google and Facebook control more than two\-thirds of the global online ad revenue, Fuchs points out that such a tax would help to create a fairer digital public sphere by which public service online media could compete with the online dominance of such corporations. 

 ORF’s Public Value Competence Centre also commissioned Prof Fuchs to contribute to their 2018 Public Value Study, which focused on democracy and public service media \[B2\]. Fuchs’ chapter in the 2018 ORF Public Value Study recommends not just the introduction of a digital services tax and a digital ad tax for funding alternative Internet platforms, but also advises that ORF is legally enabled to introduce public service Internet content platforms, for instance a public service version of YouTube and a digital version of the legendary ORF programme Club 2 \[B2, B3\]. The latter is a television show that ran between 1976 and 1995 and was characterised by uncensored, unlimited live\-debate. After Dark was the British version of Club 2 \(broadcast on Channel 4 and BBC\) \[B4\]. Fuchs suggests it be renewed in an online participatory format in order to facilitate a healthy digital public sphere. On 16/1/2019, Fuchs’ ideas were presented at a public ORF event \(‘Dialogue Forum’\), which was broadcast on ORF television later that month \[B5\]. 

 Prof Fuchs’ analysis had **direct impact on ORF’s policymaking**. His 2017 work informed **ORF’s** Theses on Austria’s Media Landscape *,* which was published at the end of that year *.* In this text, ORF Director General Alexander Wrabetz draws on the idea of the public service Internet, arguing that as a ‘correction to the algorithm\-driven filter politics on Facebook, the ORF should, as counterpoise, again be allowed to organise \(advertising\-free\) online debates’ \[B6 p.11\] and embrace the ‘new possibilities and platforms that are used on a massive scale’ \[B6 p.13\]. Committing to the position that public service media need to transform themselves from ‘broadcasters into content\-platforms’ \[B7\], Wrabetz’s *Theses* were further developed into the **ORF Strategy 2025** that, according to Wrabetz, has created the ‘foundations of the ORF’s successful development from a public service broadcaster to a public service platform’ \[B8\]. Launched in December 2020, Wrabetz characterises the development of ORF towards a public service Internet platform provider as an ‘important strategic direction for the ORF’s digital future’ \[B8\]. 

 In the *Theses,* Wrabetz also argues for the ‘application of the advertising tax to online\-advertising’ \[B6 p.15\]. The significant impact of Prof Fuchs’ 2018 research on this policy position is confirmed in a corroborating letter from ORF’s Directorate\-General: ‘The Austrian Broadcasting Corporation \(ORF\) acknowledges **the vital and extremely valuable contribution that Prof Fuchs has made and that has informed the ORF’s understanding of the foundations of online advertising and helped to develop its own policy perspective** in respect to the role that online advertising, Google and Facebook play in the digital economy. The ORF has in this context recently suggested that the Austrian advertising tax is extended to online advertising so that it would also affect Google and Facebook’ \[B9\]. 

 While an EU\-wide digital services tax failed to be agreed upon by member states, on September 20, 2019, **the Austrian parliament uniformly agreed to introduce a five percent online advertising tax** for large corporations such as Google and Facebook that came into effect on January 1, 2020 \[B10a\]. Operating as a foundation under public law and Austria’s pre\-eminent media provider, ORF’s voice is heard in the policy discourse. The Austrian digital advertising tax is important because digital monopolies that are open to ideological bias due to their corporate nature, make much of their money from online advertising; their vast financial power means they are able to crowd out politically neutral / objective public service media, thus threating the democratic nature of political discourse. This tax goes some way towards **facilitating the ability of publicly funded media to compete for the same audiences and to thus provide balanced political discourse**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research led by Professors Hill and Woolard at the University of Nottingham, as part of a long\-term and ongoing collaboration with the multi\-national biotechnology company Promega Corporation, has developed a technology to enable the high\-throughput study of ligand\-binding to cell surface receptors. The NanoBRET \(Nanoluciferase Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer\) technology is highly sensitive and specific for a given target receptor. This innovation has resulted in the introduction of new commercial products with positive impacts on commerce. Major beneficiaries are Promega, who are successfully commercialising the technology and as a result have increased employment to support product development, as well as SMEs and major pharma including GSK, who have optimised their drug discovery processes by adopting the Promega NanoBRET technology. 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 G\-Protein Coupled Receptors \(GPCRs\) mediate a variety of fundamental physiological processes and represent the largest group of proteins targeted by existing therapeutics. The development of new effective therapies that target GPCRs is only possible with the comprehensive understanding of their pharmacology and therefore new approaches that facilitate this understanding will enable the discovery of novel therapeutics. 

 In 2015 Professor Hill and colleagues at the University of Nottingham \(UoN\), the University of Western Australia and Promega developed an innovative method \(NanoBRET\) to monitor ligand binding to GPCRs on the surface of living cells. NanoBRET combines the use of fluorescently\-labelled ligands, previously developed and presented as an Impact Case Study in REF2014, with Promega’s NanoLuc protein \(a small luciferase with superior luminescence\) tagged to receptors. NanoBRET technology enables the measurement of ligand binding to GPCRs using Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer \(BRET\) and standard multi\-well bioluminescence/fluorescence plate readers. Using this technology for the first time, Professor Hill and colleagues’ research described the real\-time binding of a red fluorescent analogue of the antagonist propranolol to the human <sub>2</sub>\-adrenoreceptor, and of fluorescent agonists and antagonists to the adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> receptors in living cells **\[1\]**. This technology is ground\-breaking in comparison to traditional and established radioligand assays because it is safer \(avoiding the used of radioisotopes\), high\-throughput, cost\-effective, highly sensitive. It is also physiologically relevant, as it allows ligand binding kinetics to be measured in live cells at 37<sup>o</sup>C in real time **\[1,2,4\].** 

 Professors Hill and Woolard went a step further in 2018 and using the NanoBRET assay measured ligand binding *in vivo* in a mouse model of triple\-negative human breast cancer cells expressing nanoluciferase\-tagged <sub>2</sub>\-adrenoreceptor **\[3\]**. This was the first *in vivo* study of real\-time ligand binding using NanoBRET and it demonstrated the visualisation and measurement of the extent to which target engagement is achieved in an animal cancer model, where the vascular environment is typically compromised and often impairs access and binding of the drug to the malignant cells. 

 Professors Hill and Woolard further applied NanoBRET, underpinned by a BBSRC LINK Award with Promega **\[11\],** to fluorescently label Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor \(VEGF\) isoforms and monitor their binding to a VEGF receptor \(VEGFR2\); a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase \(RTK\), and co\-receptor neuropilin\-1 **\[5, 6\]**. RTKs are a different type of cell surface receptor to GPCRs. They initiate signalling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, migration, differentiation and cell survival, and therefore are also popular targets for cancer drug development. With these two publications, Professors Hill and Woolard validated a novel method for monitoring ligand binding to RTKs making it an attractive method for new therapeutics development that target RTKs. 

 More recently, Professor Hill and colleagues have used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique to incorporate a NanoBiT fragment \(HiBiT\) of nanoluciferase into the N\-terminus of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 under the control of its endogenous promoter. The full nanoluciferase activity can be reconstituted by addition of purified LgBiT and this has allowed ligand binding using NanoBRET to be monitored in cells that endogenously express the CXCR4 receptor at native and therefore physiological levels **\[7\]**. 

 NanoBRET has become the ligand\-binding assay of choice for many researchers, both in academic and pharma/biotech environments, due to its enhanced sensitivity, ease of use and capacity for real time monitoring in live cells. NanoBRET is now a well\-established method for investigating ligand binding to cell surface receptors and intracellular proteins.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The extensive collaboration between the UoN research team and Promega has contributed to innovation within an existing business through the introduction of new products, positively impacting commerce and the economy, with two main beneficiaries: 

1.  Promega, through the commercialisation of NanoBRET technology and the provision of contract research using NanoBRET binding assays. 

1.  Biotech, Pharma companies and CROs using NanoBRET binding assays for optimised drug discovery pipelines. 

 Promega Corporation is a US company with branches in 16 countries including the UK. 

 Professors Hill and Woolard have maintained a long\-standing and active relationship with Promega over the last seven years that was reinforced by a BBSRC Link grant \(2014\-2017\) allowing the NanoBRET technology to be applied to RTKs **\[11\]**. The BBSRC LINK grant formalised the partnership, through the implementation of a collaboration agreement, and included a substantial GBP578,413 in kind contribution from Promega that covered reagents, cell lines, the appointment of a postdoctoral scientist and substantial intellectual input from key members of the Promega Advanced Technology Group \(Madison, USA\).  Promega has further developed the NanoBRET approach described in this Impact Case Study for GPCR and RTK target engagement and expanded it successfully to monitor target engagement at intracellular kinases and a variety of other proteins. Professor Hill and GSK also have an ongoing collaboration to develop NanoBRET ligand\-binding approaches for the IL\-23 cytokine receptor. Kits and reagents exploiting the technology are now sold by Promega **\[S1\]**. Additionally, Promega has established a range of commercial collaborative projects with Pharma and Contract Research Organisations to further exploit the technology. 

 <ins>Economic impact for</ins> <ins>Promega</ins> <ins>and its Pharma/Biotech customers.</ins> 

 The collaboration between the UoN research group and Promega established a proof of concept of a commercial kit to query GPCR target engagement. Since then, this technology has been successfully applied to hundreds of targets, spanning a sizeable fraction of the druggable proteome. To date, Promega offers over 300 live cell kinase target engagement assays based on NanoBRET technology and has recently expanded that commercial offering to non\-kinase proteins including HDACs, demethylases, bromodomains, heat\-shock proteins, poly\-ADP ribosylases and E3 ligases. Promega has further built on the technology precedent established under the UoN collaboration by developing a panel of reagents, including fluorescent ligands, cell lines and DNA plasmids, which enable pharma/biotech scientists to develop novel target engagement tracers using in\-house synthetic chemistry resources. Head of Biology at Promega Corporation said *“…Promega has increased its R&D headcount to support this platform… Together, these assay kits and reagents have resulted in a major platform for Promega that has aggressive growth expectations for years to come”* **\[S2\].** Consistent with this aggressive growth expectation, Promega are expanding their branch facilities in the UK and Germany. Promega have also recently opened a new R&D building in Madison **\[S3\].** 

 Evidence of the commercial value for Promega of the NanoBRET Target Engagement technology is its highlight in the company’s corporate reports \(2017\-2020\): *“Over the years, we have developed a broad portfolio of assay reagents that meet the needs of these pharmaceutical researchers and have been used widely during various phases of drug discovery and development. For example, our NanoBRET™ Target Engagement Assays allow researchers to quantitatively measure the interaction between a molecule and a protein in live cells reliably in a high\-throughput manner.”* **\[S3\]**. 

 The NanoBRET Target Engagement Intracellular Kinase Assay was nominated for Scientist’s Choice Award by SelectScience as one of the *Best New Drug Discovery & Development Products of 2017* **\[S4\]** and awarded the Reviewer’s Choice Award for *Drug Discovery & Development Product of 2018* by SelectScience **\[S5\]**. A review of the product by a customer and user published in 2018 on SelectScience website said *“Essential and field\-changing technology…Easy to use, high quality and reproducible results. Highly recommended to others\!”* **\[S6\] **.**

 The NanoBRET technology addresses a critical need in pharma and biotech industries to be able to assess ligand\-binding kinetics with high throughput early in a drug discovery project. The rates of successful drug discovery could be improved by optimising the drug’s binding kinetics to clinical need, thereby reducing the time and cost associated with delivering new medicines to patients. This need was identified by major pharma companies who, together with the European Commission under the Innovative Medicines Initiative, funded research to deliver robust new tools to assess ligand\-binding kinetics, including NanoBRET in a high throughput plate\-reader based format. The Kinetics for Drug Discovery \(K4DD\) consortium \(k4dd.eu\) included \(GSK, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Heptares, Janssen, Merck, Roche and Sanofi\) alongside academic collaborators including the UoN. K4DD funding **\[8\]** resulted in key publications including \[ **2** and **4**\] which, due to the regular interactions between consortium partners, have been shared widely among all pharma partners during and after the project. 

  

 The global health\-care company GSK has changed its processes as a result of adopting the new NanoBRET ligand\-binding technology. In their letter of support for the UoN researchers, Director of Chemical Biology at GSK and Director of the Crick\-GSK Biomedical LinkLabs said *“NanoBRET is now regularly used \[at GSK\] to both identify small molecules and characterize cellular ligand\-binding kinetics early in a drug discovery project. This has enabled us to make informed, quicker project progression decisions, which has had a direct impact on the GSK drug discovery pipeline. To date, GSK have commissioned Promega to develop six novel NanoBRET reagents, in addition to the purchase of five established assays.”* **\[S7\].** 

 There is further evidence that international pharma companies are adopting NanoBRET technology at different stages of early hit prioritization steps of compound screening. Recent studies by Amgen Inc and Bristol\-Myers Squibb have reported the development and implementation of a high\-throughput NanoBRET Target Engagement assay to assess compound engagement to two kinases associated with human disease **\[S8, S9\].** Additional evidence supporting the wide\-spread adoption of this technology is that major manufacturers of microplate reader instruments have also adapted their devices to be able to read the signal from NanoBRET assays. These include global companies BMG LABTECH, Thermo Fisher Scientific, PerkinElmer and Molecular Devices **\[S10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research by the Text Analysis Group \(TAG\) Laboratory at the University of Sussex has contributed to increased governmental and third sector organisational capacity to process and acquire knowledge from social media and other digital platforms, at a time when maintaining up\-to\-date awareness of these channels’ use and trends is of increasing importance. Through the development of a versatile software platform, the co\-founding with the think tank Demos of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media \(CASM\), and the creation of CASM Technology LLP, the lab’s research has increased understanding and enabled better\-informed analysis and activity within these organisations, which has also benefitted the public and stakeholder groups they serve, on both a national and international scale. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 <ins>The TAG Lab was co\-founded by David Weir, winner of the Kuroda prize 2014, and Jeremy Reffin</ins><ins>;</ins> <ins>f</ins><ins>rom its</ins> <ins>outset</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>laboratory</ins> <ins>was designed to cultivate a cyclical interaction between fundamental and applied research. This has occurred through: \(a\) fundamental research within the field of natural language processing \(NLP\) and machine learning to create new, generic capabilities to analyse large, unstructured corpora of text;</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>\(b\) the integration of these and other data scientific methodologies into a technology platform, Method5</ins><ins>1</ins><ins>, to make them accessible, usable and useful to researchers with backgrounds outside of NLP and data science</ins><ins>.</ins> 

 <ins>As</ins> <ins>TAG</ins> <ins>L</ins>ab <ins>researchers</ins> <ins>engaged in</ins> <ins>‘research\-in\-the\-wild’, the central importance of the document classification problem became apparent</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>TAG</ins> <ins>Lab</ins> <ins>researchers produc</ins><ins>ed</ins> <ins>two publications in this area:</ins> <ins> **\[</ins><ins>R</ins><ins>1\]**</ins><ins>, which addressed the</ins> <ins>significant</ins> <ins>challenge</ins><ins>s</ins> <ins>associated with</ins> <ins>domain adaptation, and</ins> **\[R2\]**, which proposed methods that address the need to trade off precision and recall. The findings and insights arising from both of these works directly informed the design and implementation of Method51. 

 A second body of research was dedicated to understanding the form and method whereby the capabilities conferred by machine learning and NLP could be made available to the wider research community, especially with a view to address the specific problems posed by social media research, and the questions such research was being used to answer. This research suggested that the deployments of NLP best suited to this research needed to \(i\) include bespoke models trained to specific datasets, \(ii\) be used and understood by subject matter experts on the content being analysed, and \(iii\) be trained in agile and iterative ways **\[R3, R4\].** This was achieved through the adoption and further development of the open\-source DUALIST framework **.** These insights were then incorporated into Method51, driving further technical work on NLP classification and the platform itself **\[R5, R6\].** 

 The third body of research has been cross\-disciplinary and collaborative, through CASM, with other academics at the University of Sussex and elsewhere, and with the think tank Demos. TAG Lab and Demos researchers worked together to integrate data science with social science, to develop the wider social scientific methodological framework that Method51 should be used within. This began in 2013 with research funded by: the ESRC \[G1\], which enabled the team’s first attempts to conduct attitudinal research on social media; The Open Society European Policy Institute \[G2\]; and attitudinal research regarding immigration, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation \[G3\]. Since 2014, the TAG Lab has also received funding from: the Technology Strategy Board/EPSRC \[G4\] to collaborate with the polling company Ipsos MORI to further develop methodological and ethical frameworks; the Open Society European Policy Institute \[G5\] to apply and extend a framework for electoral participation; and the Police Knowledge Fund \[G6\] to analyse online hate speech and offline hate crime data. 

 <ins>I</ins>n 2015, TAG Lab members created Method52, a professional software platform based on the Method51 underpinning research, which is maintained and developed through CASM Technology LLP.

 <ins> **Demos.**</ins> <ins>This is evidenced</ins> <ins>emphatically</ins> <ins>by</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>Demos</ins> <ins>think</ins> <ins>tank</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>which</ins> <ins>co\-founded CASM with</ins> <ins>the T</ins><ins>AG</ins> <ins>L</ins><ins>ab, University of Sussex.</ins> <ins>Polly Mackenzie</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>Chief</ins> <ins>E</ins><ins>xecutive of</ins> <ins>Demos</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>describes the partnership with</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>T</ins><ins>AG</ins> <ins>L</ins><ins>ab, the founding of</ins> <ins>CASM</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>and d</ins><ins>eployment of</ins> <ins>M</ins><ins>ethod52</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>as</ins> <ins>cr</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>tical</ins> <ins>to t</ins><ins>he</ins> <ins>organisation’s</ins> <ins>capacity to interact</ins> <ins>with</ins> <ins>and understand the online world</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>and therefore of huge significance to</ins> <ins>Demos’</ins> <ins>development as a</ins><ins>n effective think</ins> <ins>tank.</ins> 

 “CASM was set up as a unique capability in the UK: with the University of Sussex's partnership, we were the first think tank unit to be able to produce policy\-focused research into these new and exciting spaces.” **\[S1\]** 

 Mackenzie directly attributes the partnership with CASM to Demos’ ability to operate effectively within this online world and, as a consequence, gain research intelligence and insight which would not otherwise be possible: 

 “Method52 is the technology allowing Demos to meaningfully interact with the online world, to listen and understand, and to cut through the noise in a manner that remains best in class in UK civil society. Since then, our work with the Cabinet Office, Home Office, Metropolitan Police, Foreign Office as well as a range of academic funding bodies and private sector partners has enabled new, impactful public\-facing research on issues as diverse as gambling, democracy, extremism and disinformation. Our work has been cited in hundreds of news sources, including dedicated media partnerships and the embedding of our technology in the BBC, the Daily Telegraph, the Times and Irish Times, Buzzfeed and others, and our joint technology suite has led to work presented to MPs and civil servants including evidence in the Houses of Commons and Lords. Our work would have been impossible without the partnership with the University of Sussex.” **\[S1\] ** 

 Beyond enhancing Demos’ organisational capability and capacity to fulfil its mission as an independent think tank, CASM’s technology has also been deployed to provide insight and intelligence to the benefit of those organisations and governmental bodies working in partnership with Demos. 

 A comprehensive yet not even complete list of projects which deployed Method52 provided by Demos **\[S2\]** shows the wide range and scale of settings in which the technology has been used to provide intelligence and insight to a diverse range of stakeholders. These range from providing insight into anti\-Muslim content on Twitter to the Mayor of London’s policing and crime summit \(2017\), providing intelligence on Russian influence operations on Twitter \(2017\) and using social media analysis to explore attitudes to the EU \(2014\). **\[S2\]** 

 Method52 has also been deployed with significant and sustained benefit by other organisations who have worked in partnership with CASM Technology LLP. These include: 

  

 <ins> **Global initiative</ins><ins>**</ins> <ins>\(GI\)</ins><ins>. Global Initiative</ins> <ins>is</ins> <ins>an inter</ins><ins>national NGO based in Geneva who</ins> <ins>are using</ins> <ins>M</ins><ins>ethod52 to develop more reliable ways of tracking illegal wildlife trade.</ins> \[text removed for publication\]<ins>,</ins> <ins>a senior Analyst a</ins><ins>t</ins> <ins>Global</ins> <ins>initiative</ins> <ins>confirms that the tool develop</ins><ins>ed by Global</ins> <ins>Initiative using</ins> <ins>M</ins><ins>ethod52 has given their analysts</ins> <ins>increased capacity to understand and track illegal international wildlife trade:</ins> 

 “What we do have is an increasingly reliable ability to find more instances of illegal trading with less bias than any of the other methods and tools that people are using as far as we are aware.” **\[S3\]** 

 Another capability of Method52 which \[text removed for publication\] sees as particularly beneficial for Global Initiative is being able to share data: “One thing which we are currently working on is the development of a dashboard which allows us to share results with partners which could include other NGOs or academics or even possibly law enforcement. The aim is to use the tool’s detections as a data foundation to shift this illegal trade off mainstream platforms” **\[S3\].** This tool – currently in development by Global Initiative using Method52 – is being deployed on an international level, with results being shared with Interpol as well as other international bodies **\[S3\]**. 

 <ins> **Institute for Strategic Dialogue**</ins> <ins>\(ISD\).</ins> <ins>The international reach and significance of the technology for international NGO communities is also exemplified by</ins> <ins>ISD</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>a</ins>n independent, non\-profit <ins>organi</ins><ins>s</ins><ins>ation</ins> <ins>dedicated to safeguarding human rights and reversing the rising tide of</ins> <ins>polarisation</ins><ins>, extremism and disinformation worldwide. ISD uses</ins> <ins>M</ins><ins>ethod52 to</ins> <ins>“fundamentally inform and enable” their ongoing work to better understand these</ins> <ins>issues</ins><ins>, which in turn underpins their contributions to public policy development, as well as their educational and civic action</ins> <ins>programmes</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>ISD CEO Sasha Havlic</ins><ins>e</ins><ins>k</ins> <ins>outlines a key example</ins><ins>:</ins> 

 <ins>“</ins><ins>In relation to mapping hate speech online… our research has</ins> <ins>been used by both local authorities and by national governments to inform their policy responses. This is evidence\-based policy making in action. We have done this with local government in the UK, regional government in Australia and with the national governments of New Zealand and Canada. And we have also built a hate tracking capability with CASM to map hate actors and their activities online in the US</ins><ins>..</ins><ins>. We are essentially building a new joint capability – perhaps the most advanced capability in existence in the civic sector – for the discovery and identification of malign information operations in order to be able to inform the public as well as policymakers. Furthermore, we are doing that with data that is of a social science standard – because of CASM – so that it can be used as a basis for public policy and is accurate enough to inform operational response.”</ins> **\[S4\]** 

 <ins>Further benefits from the ISD’s</ins> <ins>deploy</ins><ins>ment of</ins> <ins>M</ins><ins>ethod52</ins> <ins> **\[S5\]**</ins> <ins>include</ins><ins>:</ins>

This meant that 200</ins> <ins>organisations</ins><ins>, some of them large\-scale, were able to better manage the threat and respond in new ways as a result of the intelligence we were able to share with them</ins><ins>.”</ins> <ins> **\[S5\]**</ins> 

1.  acquiring intelligence which informed its submission to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport \(DCMS\) for its online Harms White paper consultation **\[S5\]** as well as the ISD consultation on the EU Digital Services Act **\[S6\].** 

 <ins>Havlicek adds that the tool has been mission critical to the successful operation of their</ins> <ins>organisation</ins><ins>:</ins> 

 “Method52 forms the essential tech basis from which we gain insight into hate and disinformation online. This helps us to fulfil our core mission of tracking extremism, terrorism, hate speech and disinformation… Method52 is the best resource available for monitoring this set of threats in my professional opinion. It is the key tool which enables us to provide critical research and policy briefing to governments and civic partners… We have evaluated and used other tools as well as M\[ethod\]52 but… they don’t allow researchers to interrogate the data in ways that give us significant confidence in the quality of our results.” **\[S4\]**

 <ins>A</ins><ins>mong the wide</ins> <ins>range of broadcast media \(including newspapers\) using Method52 in this way</ins> <ins> **\[S7\]**</ins> <ins>is</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>BBC</ins><ins>, whose</ins> <ins>senior</ins> <ins>P</ins><ins>roducer</ins> \[text removed for publication\] <ins>confirms its value to broadcasters:</ins> 

 “As programme makers, this technology is useful in that it gives us ideas and insights into trends that are happening and it gives us a sense of perspective and scale when we are interested in covering a particular topic.” **\[S8\]** 

 Examples include BBC Click’s work with CASM to analyze online abuse during the 2019 general election, which culminated in the 30\-minute ‘deep dive’ episode ‘The Outrage Election’. The collaboration sought to analyse over 5 million Tweets to identify how much of the discussion involved personal attacks on candidates; the Method52 NLP “classifier that was trained for this purpose was eventually able to identify insulting and abusive Tweets with an accuracy of 71%.” **\[S9\]** \(pp4\-5\). The research was also used by the BBC “to show how misinformation is spread, including how the Coronavirus has been exploited on media platforms by particular political groups, in this case far right groups. We were able to show the audience how misinformation happens<ins>,</ins> <ins>\[</ins><ins>and</ins><ins>\]</ins> <ins>how there were spikes at certain periods.”</ins> <ins> **\[S</ins><ins>8</ins><ins>\]**</ins> 

 <ins>T</ins><ins>he technology</ins><ins>’</ins>s <ins>ability to provide reliable researched content for output</ins> is of crucial benefit to broadcasters and journalists, as it enables them <ins>to “make sense of the noise”</ins><ins>.</ins> \[text removed for publication\] <ins>explain</ins><ins>s</ins><ins>:</ins> 

 “The Internet is here to stay and there is a lot of noise out there so it is useful to have something which puts this noise into some sort of understandable form. This sort of research backs up content and gives us useful figures and numbers which is very helpful to be able to show. It is always useful to have some academic research which helps to put things into context and give a sense of scale. This research is also picking up the subtle ways that misinformation is conveyed and that is extremely valuable.” **\[S8\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Galanis’ analysis of the effectiveness of monetary policies that support green financial systems has informed party\-political policy debates and enabled the UK Labour Party, the EU Parliament and the World Wide Fund for Nature \(WWF\) Hellas to promote the introduction of green investment programmes for banks in an effort to reduce CO2 emissions. Providing politicians, policy makers and campaigners with new information about the financial stability of green quantitative easing schemes has enabled the development and realisation of campaign pledges and contributed to debates about the financial industry’s potential contribution to green new deal. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Galanis’ research at the Institute of Management Studies \(IMS\) at Goldsmiths is motivated by questions about the interconnections between financial stability and environmental sustainability. Since the 2007 global financial crisis, the potential role of the banking industry in delivering green policies has received considerable attention among policy makers and policy institutions. Existing economic models that inform policy making, however, lack a clear understanding of the interaction between macroeconomic, environmental, and financial variables. Without these data, policy makers cannot advocate policies which target both financial stability and environmental sustainability. 

 **Computational economic models:** In order to provide a critical analysis that speaks to financial stability and environmental sustainability, Galanis’ develops computational economic models which includes writing the functional forms that take into account people’s cognitive limitations and relevant biases. His article, ""Macroeconomic and stock market interactions with endogenous aggregate sentiment dynamics"" \(2018\) is an example of Galanis’ use of economic modelling to capture how financial stability is an emerging phenomenon in advanced financial systems \[R1\]. 

 In 2016, Galanis, working with colleagues from the University of Greenwich \(Dafermos and Nikolaidi\) and the New Economics Foundation \(NEF\) co\-developed a new computational economic model to analyse the interaction between ecosystems, financial systems, and the macroeconomy. By running a simulation analysis using the Dynamic Ecosystem\-FINance In Economy \(DEFINE\) model, Galanis and the research team were able to evaluate and model the extent to which the implementation of a green quantitative easing programme would help banks reduce the financial risk associated with climate change \[R2\]. 

 **Analysing the interconnections between financial stability and environmental sustainability:** The simulation analysis using the DEFINE model suggests that *if* central banks buy a specific proportion of green bonds and *if* they keep the same share of the green bond market in the next decade, then the purchase of corporate green bonds reduces their interest rate, in comparison to the interest rate on conventional bonds. A reduced interest rate is a lower risk outcome which means that businesses become more willing to invest in projects involving renewables and energy efficiency. Furthermore, the lower cost of borrowing on the bond market would make businesses more willing to issue bonds, instead of relying on bank loans. Galanis’ co\-authored article, *Climate Change, Financial Stability and Monetary Policy* \(2018\), uses this analysis to show that in comparison to a business\-as\-usual scenario, green quantitative easing \(QE\) programmes can help boost investment in renewables and energy efficiency which would help reduce global warming in the long run \[R3\]. As more firms invested in green initiatives, in response to lower interest rates on green bonds, the financial health of these businesses and banks would consequently lead to greater financial stability and a reduction of CO2 emissions. 

 **Challenging misconceptions about the destabilising effect of green financial systems:** The research findings provide the first coherent study on the effects of green quantitative easing and shows that central banks could help countries move closer toward their decarbonisation targets by purchasing green corporate bonds without risking financial instability. Galanis’ articulation of green finance and financial stability has been presented to the GUE/NGL \(Confederal Group of the European Left/ Nordic Green Left\) Parliamentary Group in the European Parliament who were discussing “EU peripheral economies from austerity to sustainable growth’ \(December 2016\). The research has also been used to discredit claims that green monetary policies have a destabilising effect on the economy. For example, in 2019, the APO Australian Think\-tank, cited ‘Climate Change, Financial Stability and Monetary Policy’ to mount a challenge to a leading politician who had questioned the sustainability of green policies and finances.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Finding ways to transition to a low carbon economy is a key policy challenge across the world that has implications for all major industries. However, it has not always been clear how central banks might contribute to new green policies without taking on additional financial risk. Galanis’ research on the interconnection between sustainable banking practices and the macroeconomy has helped challenge misconceptions about this risk, providing the Vice President for the European Parliament, the economic adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature \(WWF\) Hellas and the Labour Party \(UK\) with evidence that allows them to advocate for new green financial initiatives. 

 <ins> **Informing green financial policy recommendations and pledges**</ins> 

 **Council on Economic Policies \(CEP\) propose that banks contribute to low carbon economy:** In November 2017, Galanis’ co\-authors, Dafermos and Nikolaidi, presented their research analysis on green fiscal policy at a CEP workshop on ‘Central Banking and Green Finance’. The CEP went on to release proposals regarding how central banks can help the transition towards a low carbon economy in a discussion paper entitled, ‘Central Banks and the Transition to a Low Carbon Economy’ \(2018\). The paper cites Galanis and his co\-researchers report in relation to questions about whether green quantitative easing is a realistic and financially stable option for central banks \[S1\]. 

 **EU Parliament propose amendments for a sustainable finance bill:** Galanis gave a presentation on his research to the EU parliament in 2017, whereafter MEP Dimitrios Papadimoulis, Vice President of the European Parliament and his Cabinet maintained close contact, initiating continued discussions on issues regarding green financial policies and drawing on Galanis’ two articles in *Ecological Economics* \[R3, R4\]. An email from the Office of the Vice President of the European Parliament confirms how Papadimoulis used Galanis’ research: “As a direct result \[..\], Mr Papadimoulis proposed amendments to the ‘Sustainable Finance’ report of the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament \(ECON\) in October 2017; citing the two papers” \[S2\]. While the bill was not passed, the citation and Papadimoulis’ subsequent thinking on amendments to EU sustainable finance reports is indicative of the interest in Galanis’ analysis of sustainable banking initiatives and the use of the research to inform political debates and EU legislation \[S3\]. 

 **Australian think tank cites research to support claim that green initiatives would not be ‘economy wrecking’:** In May 2019, the Australia Institute, an independent public policy think tank, published a discussion paper claiming that Australia could achieve ambitious green targets without severely impacting on the economy. Their evaluation countered claims by the Business Council of Australia \(BCA\) which suggested that increased action on climate change would be ‘economy wrecking’ and raised questions about the Australian government’s approach to environmental policies. Citing Galanis’ co\-authored paper \[R3\] as evidence of the, ‘significant cost of inaction’ and specifically the **systemic financial risk** associated with ‘excess investment in fossil fuel and other high carbon assets’, the Australian Institute’s report contributes to their mission to challenge misconceptions by sourcing robust research and applying it to real world problems \[S4\]. 

 **WWF Hellas advise the Greek Government on the creation of a Hellenic Development Bank:** The DEFINE model’s analysis on the relationship between green finance and financial stability was originally developed in conjunction with the New Economics Foundation \(NEF\). Former NEF Senior Economist, Oliver Vardakoulias, who now works as Economic Policy Coordinator for the WWF Hellas, describes how he used DEFINE’s subsequent analysis to further the work of the WWF and to guide his recommendations to the Greek Government: 

 “After joining WWF Greece in 2018, I have been using the publications and research results of Dr Galanis and his co\-authors \(a\) to **lobby financial regulators** for the need of investigating the links between Greece’s financial sector, macroeconomic stability and environmental sustainability; and \(b\) to **formulate specific recommendations** to the Greek government in the context of the creation of the Hellenic Development Bank \(HDB\) in 2019.” \[S5\] 

 **Labour Party use new information about the financial viability of green banking systems to endorse their proposals for a Green New Deal:** Galanis’ research has also played a role in the Labour Party’s 2019 Election Manifesto and has contributed to their commitment to a Green New Deal. In October 2018 the Labour Party launched ‘The Green Transformation: Labour’s environment policy’ marking Labour’s new focus on climate action, which paved the way for the party’s commitment to a ‘green industrial revolution’, announced by Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, John McDonnell MP \(2015\-2020\) in June 2019. 

 Labour’s pledge included a review of the role of the financial sector in helping with climate crisis, as described in the subsequent report: ‘Finance and Climate Change: A Progressive Green Finance Strategy for the UK’. Galanis’ co\-researchers, Nikolaidi and Dafermos were on the external review group that produced this report and the findings of the *Ecological Economics* paper on *‘*Climate Change’ directly informed five of the key recommendations \[S6\]: 

-  Make climate\-related financial disclosures mandatory 

-  Green the mandate of the Bank of England by re\-interpreting and/or modifying it 

-  Green the collateral framework of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Operations 

-  Use the NIB to steer bank credit towards low\-carbon projects 

-  Green the Bank of England’s Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme 

 The report, published in November 2019, attracted considerable attention, as evidenced through articles in *The Financial Times, Bloomberg* and *ITV* news \[S7\]. 

 In September 2019 delegates at the Labour Party conference voted overwhelmingly in favour of a Green New Deal programme which pointed to ‘radical policies to increase social and economic justice’. After the surprise announcement of a general election in October 2019,  Labour launched their Election Manifesto which identified green financial investments as part of their commitment to ‘A Green Industrial Revolution’. Labour’s pledge included the introduction of a ‘Sustainable Investment Board’, costing environmental impacts into fiscal decisions made by the Office for Budget Responsibility and ensuring the UK’s financial sector is more involved in efforts to tackle climate crisis: 

 “We will do this by improving the fitness of our financial authorities to mobilise green investment and by giving them powers to manage the risk to financial stability posed by short\-sighted investment in polluting assets.” \[S8\] 

 Leading campaign group, Friends of the Earth, noted that Labour’s election pledges are the ‘greenest’/strongest on climate change interventions and while Labour lost the 2019 election, they continue to support a green new deal, as evident in declarations regarding post\-pandemic financial support that advocate radical green investment programmes to address the climate emergency.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 We have developed a range of quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging \(MRI\) methods that allow a comprehensive, non\-invasive assessment of human physiology *in vivo*. These methods have been applied to a range of dynamic processes including studies of the gastrointestinal \(GI\) tract, respiratory tract, kidneys and heart. Our MRI innovations in this area have: \(1\) been exploited by the medical technology and pharmaceutical sectors to provide information to regulators and licensing agencies which has influenced European Consensus and NICE guidelines and led to commercial impact \( *Baxter Healthcare and BBraun, Fresenius Kabi and Fresenius Medical Care, Procter & Gamble, Simulations Plus*\); \(2\) provided insights for industry and regulators in the assessment of the health benefits of food products \( *Unilever, Zespri International Limited*\); \(3\) provided new quantitative imaging biomarkers of disease progression and treatment response \( *JEB technologies, Motilent*\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Group \(SPMIG\) in the School of Physics and Astronomy \(SoPA\) are pioneers in the development of novel quantitative MRI \(qMRI\) techniques to enable the non\-invasive measurement of key biophysical parameters *in vivo*. This approach transcends standard imaging performed in routine clinical radiology, by providing unique spatio\-temporal information on the dynamic phenomena that underlie complex physiological processes. The SPMIG has harnessed its considerable expertise in the physics of MRI and its long experience in fast imaging, to develop novel, integrated MR acquisition and analysis protocols for dynamic mapping of NMR relaxation times \(T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>\), viscosity, flow, organ motility and other key measures. Importantly, these unique tools allow a comprehensive assessment of the function of individual organs, and of interactions between organs, all in a single examination, enabling innovative studies of disease processes and responses to therapies. Here we present the underpinning research on the gastrointestinal \(GI\) tract, upper respiratory tract, kidney and heart which led to this case study. 

 Since 2000, through longstanding collaborations with Professors Robin Spiller and Luca Marciani \( [National Institute of Health Research \(NIHR\) Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre](https://nottinghambrc.nihr.ac.uk/)\), the SPMIG has developed and optimised qMRI for the measurement of key biophysical parameters to study GI function **\[i\-v, I\-III\]**, including: gut motility; the breakdown of model particles to study intraluminal forces; intraluminal emulsification of fat; gastric emptying and intraluminal viscosity of model meals **\[1\-3\];** small bowel water content and colonic volumes **\[4\];** and water pocket volumes in the bowel and colonic motility **\[5\]**. Examples of applications include *in vivo* studies of intragastric gelation **\[1\]**, the fate of aerated drinks in the gastric lumen **\[3\]**, and gastric emptying of preoperative metabolic preconditioning drinks in healthy volunteers **\[6\]**. Since 2013 **\[7\]**, the group have developed novel MR marker capsules, combined with bespoke MRI sequences for detecting them with high sensitivity, to measure whole\-gut transit time without ionizing radiation; these markers have recently been used in a first\-in\-child study **\[8\]**. These methods have also been re\-purposed to study the upper respiratory tract **\[9, IV\].** 

 The application of qMRI to understand kidney function forms part of a collaboration with Professor Dileep Lobo \( [NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre](https://nottinghambrc.nihr.ac.uk/)\), and Professors Nicholas Selby and Maarten Taal \( [Centre for Kidney Research and Innovation, University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/renal/)\). The SPMIG has a long history of developing Arterial Spin Labelling \(ASL\) methods to measure tissue perfusion \(blood flow\) using intrinsic magnetic labelling of blood. This has been adapted to measure renal and cardiac perfusion, crucially overcoming the need to administer contrast agents contraindicated in kidney disease. We have combined ASL with other qMRI methods **\[vi, vii\]** for the assessment of hemodynamics \(blood flow and perfusion **\[10\]**\), oxygenation, and microstructure \(inflammation and fibrosis\), providing new insights into physiology in health **\[11, V\-VI\]** and renal disease **\[12\]**, most recently in an international study of COVID\-19\-associated renal injury **\[viii\]**. We performed the world’s first intradialytic qMRI studies, overcoming technical hurdles to allow patients to undergo dialysis within the challenging MRI environment, providing new information on the cardiac **\[11, VII\]** and multiorgan \(cardiac/renal/brain\) blood flow “stress” that occurs during dialysis **\[VIII\]**. 

 Since 2000 our work on qMRI has been supported by the Research Councils \(GBP33.8M\), Trusts and Charities \(GBP5.5M\), Industry \(GBP3.9M\), and Government \(GBP1.8M\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Our work on developing qMRI methods has had significant impact through three principal routes, by providing \(1\) information to medical technology and pharmaceutical industries, regulators and licencing agencies; \(2\) critical assessment of health benefits of food products for industry and regulators; \(3\) new quantitative imaging biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The value of these studies to the commercial sector can be gauged by grants to the SPMIG totalling GBP1.6M in the REF2021 assessment period; exemplar projects are listed below. 

1.  **Testing pharmaceuticals to inform industry, regulators and licencing agencies** 

 Our use of qMRI to directly monitor physiology in human subjects has attracted the interest of companies who are seeking to optimise drug and therapy formulations. 

1.  With *Baxter Healthcare* \(a multinational health care company\) and *BBraun* \(a German medical and pharmaceutical device company\) **\[V, VI\]**, we performed studies using our qMRI methods to assess changes in renal haemodynamics during infusions of fluids after surgery \(Postoperative Fluid Therapy\). We confirmed that hyperchloraemia acidosis caused by saline overload can lead to a decrease in renal blood flow and perfusion, a phenomenon we demonstrated in humans for the first time **\[11\]**. Our results influenced international guidance on improved fluid therapy for optimal patient care \( *NICE Guidelines: Intravenous fluid therapy in adults in Hospital*, 10 December 2013 **\[a, page 153\]**, in addition to five European guidelines **\[a\]**\). Due to increased awareness of saline\-induced hyperchloraemic acidosis, as demonstrated by our research and incorporated into guidelines, balanced fluids rather than saline are now the choice of fluid therapy in hospitals in the UK and Europe. 

1.  We used our qMRI methods to study gastric emptying of liquid oral preoperative metabolic preconditioning regimens measured in healthy adults with the global healthcare company *Fresenius Kabi* **\[6, I; 2009\]**. Results of this study were used as evidence in the ESPEN preoperative fasting guidelines **\[b, page 629; 2017\].** 

1.  In 2015 with *Fresenius Medical Care*, we performed ground\-breaking first\-in\-human intradialytic MRI **\[c\]** to examine the acute effects of haemodialysis treaments on cardiac blood flow \(Cardiac MRI in Dialysis \(CAMRID\),  [Clinical Trial NCT02494843](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02494843)\) **\[13, VII\]**. In 2018 this was followed by a study of haemodialysis on multiorgan blood flow \(HD\-REMODEL: HaemoDialysis interventions to REduce Multi\-Organ Dysfunction and Effect on quality of Life Assessed by MRI Scanning,  [Clinical Trial NCT03280901](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03280901)\) **\[VIII\]**. *Fresenius Medical* *Care* state ‘ *quantitative MRI techniques developed at Nottingham have provided us with unprecedented understanding on how dialysis acutely affects organ function, influencing our dialysis treatments’* **\[c\]**. 

1.  For the last 40 years, the pharmaceutical industry has inferred critical information on the behaviour of drug preparations in the gut from bench measurements that have little relevance *in vivo* \(e.g. dissolution in 900 mL of water under a vortex\). The rate of dissolution is highly dependent on the volume and distribution of water in the gut, and so in 2014, we measured the water pocket volumes within the gut following ingestion of a 240 mL water drink \(standard recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) for testing solid oral dosage forms\) **\[2\]**. This generated the “ *Mudie model*” that is now a component of  [*Simulations Plus*](https://www.simulations-plus.com/software/gastroplus/)) software *GastroPlus* **\[d\]**. This has provided the pharmaceutical industry with the first pharmacokinetic simulation software based on actual *in vivo* measurements. 

1.  With *Procter & Gamble \(P&G\)*  **\[9, IV; 2014\]** we used qMRI methods to show that a standard 100 μg dose of oxymetazoline Sinex spray maintained the volume of open airway in the nasal sinuses for 12 hours. *P&G* went on to use our MRI data to inform computational fluid dynamics simulations of airflow through the sinuses aimed at understanding the impact of the changes in sinus volume on airway resistance. On the basis of this work *P&G* were able to generate new licences and modify existing licences across the world, demonstrating 12 hours of duration of action, compared to previous claims of only 8 hours **\[e\]**. *P&G* state *‘this was successful in convincing the regulatory authorities across Europe to make a change to the licensed duration of action for Vicks Sinex Soother/Aloe nasal spray. This result has had a big impact to our Vicks Sinex business in Europe*’ **\[e\]**. 

1.  **Scientific assessment of health benefits for the food industry and regulators** 

 As part of a Framework Agreement with *Unilever* to develop functional foods, we used our GI methods to perform studies of the fate of fat, and the production of foam within the stomach to explore the control of satiety with Slim\-Fast **\[3\]**. Unilever states that ‘ *the novel insights on the gastrointestinal behaviour of aerated drinks provided by MRI by measuring separate volumes of foam, liquid, and air layers in the stomach has greatly improved our understanding of foam stability*’ **\[f, II\]**. In 2018, we conducted a study with *Zespri International Limited* **\[4, III\]**, the world’s largest marketer of kiwifrui, using our qMRI methods to show that kiwifruit increases water retention in the small bowel and ascending colon, and total colonic volume. These results have ‘ *boosted Zespri’s global health marketing and supported gut health marketing in their current online campaign*’  [https://www.zespri.com/en\-NZ/digestive\-health](https://www.zespri.com/en-NZ/digestive-health). Our work was also ‘ *one of the key studies that was used as evidence for Zespri’s bid for a European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\) health claim on laxation’* and led to an ‘ *overall increase in brand value’* **\[g\]**. 

1.  **Development of imaging biomarkers for clinical impact in healthcare** 

 a\) Building on Chaddock *et al.* 2014 **\[7\],** we developed a new medical device, MR transit markers TransiCap<sup>TM</sup>, on which we hold patents \(EP 3166488 A1, WO 2016005731 A1\) **\[h\]**. TransiCap<sup>TM</sup> provides a new method to assess GI transit in the paediatric and adult population, providing an alternative to ionising radiation X\-ray and radiopaque devices currently in use worldwide. We have worked with *JEB Technologies Ltd*, a UK\-based precision engineering company expert in the design, development, assembly and manufacture of medical products, to develop TransiCap<sup>TM</sup> under GBP1.8M NIHR i4i grants **\[i\-ii\]**. *JEB Technologies* state **\[j\]:** ‘ *Since 2016, we have worked with your group on the manufacturing, CE marking and commercialisation of TransiCap<sup>TM</sup>’.* *JEB has invested over and above £350,000 of our own money into the development. Working closely with the clinical teams, and utilising their core skills, we have been able to further enhance the product which has enabled us to shorten the development time. \[..\] it has enabled our project dedicated engineering and regulatory teams to fully understand clinical unmet needs, and patient benefits this device provides.’* We performed the first\-in\-child study **\[9\]** and a multicentre paediatric clinical trial MAGIC2 \( [Clinical Trial ISRCTN42273449](http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN42273449)\) **\[iii\]** is underway to assess the efficacy of TransiCap<sup>TM</sup> in determining whole gut transit time, and to inform treatment selection in paediatric constipation. 

 b\) Our work has strongly influenced *Motilent*, a technology company focused on delivering innovative analysis services for quantitative investigation of the gut **\[k\]**. *Motilent* has CE Marked its core technology GIQuant® which provides a clinically validated, objective disease\-activity score for Crohn’s disease of the small bowel based on intestinal motility. The SPMIG’s impact on the company is outlined by their founder, *Motilent* CEO who writes **\[k\]**: ‘ *The UoN GI imaging team and Motilent jointly pioneered a method to quantify colonic motility…. We now offer these measures in our*  [*STMM*](https://www.motilent.co.uk/research-tool/) \( *Spatio‐Temporal Motility MR\) package, used in conjunction with the outputs from GIQuant*. *Our collaboration* *with the UoN GI imaging team, has brought greater attention to our respiratory motion \(* [*RespCorrect*](https://www.motilent.co.uk/research-tool/) *\) technology.’* The benefit of such technology is seen in diseases like Crohn's where intestinal motility \(previously assesed invasively\) is an early biomarker of treatment response to drugs. We are currently working on NIHR, MRC **\[iii\-v\]** and Innovate UK grants \(GBP3M\) with *Motilent* as commercial lead.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 By putting public engagement at the heart of our deep\-sea research, we have delivered benefits to society by generating inspiration and curiosity about science, raising awareness of our research insights and their context, and providing cultural enrichment by supporting lifelong learning. We achieved these impact goals through a programme of activities including: 

-  working with broadcast documentary makers to feature findings from our research\(e.g. underpinning research included in BBC *Blue Planet II*, now reaching \~1 billion worldwide\); 

-  creating and delivering an interactive online programme to engage people with our research\(e.g. a Massive Open Online Course with >52,000 enrolments from people in 183 countries\); 

-  producing a popular science book highlighting our recent discoveries and delivering a related series of >70 in\-person engagement events nationwide \(to total audiences of >94,000 people\); 

-  providing specific input to briefings and reports for UK policymakers, directly informing legislative recommendations for deep\-sea mining with results from our research. 

 This overall programme of engagement with our research has raised wider awareness of the diversity of habitats and life in the deep ocean, the impacts of human activities on deep\-sea environments, the potential of resources in the deep ocean, and the choices from personal to policy level that will determine its future. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Deep ocean environments, defined as depths greater than 200 metres, cover more than 65 per cent of the surface of our planet and are under increasing pressure from human activities, such as the exploitation of their resources and the disposal of our waste. Our underpinning research explores the biodiversity and ecology of deep\-sea environments, including their vulnerability to future activities such as deep\-sea mining, supported by several NERC grants since 2008. 

 This programme of research has involved expeditions with UK research ships, including two led by Copley as Principal Scientist, using NERC's deep\-diving Remotely Operated Vehicle. The multidisciplinary approach of the Southampton team, working with other UK and international partners, synthesises biological, geochemical, and geological data to provide a full environmental context for interpreting ecological patterns in deep\-sea habitats. This has resulted in the following discoveries that underpin this Impact Case Study \(research outputs \[ **3.1** to **3.6**\] listed Section 3\): 

-  the discovery and ecology of hydrothermal vents on the Mid\-Cayman Spreading Centre of the Caribbean Sea \[ **3.1**\], and the adaptations of a new shrimp species dominating those vents \[ **3.2**\]; 

-  the discovery and ecology of ""black smoker"" hydrothermal vents in the Southern Ocean \[ **3.3**\],and the adaptations of a new crab species \(the ""Hoff"" crab\) that is abundant at those vents \[ **3.4**\]; 

-  the discovery of six previously undescribed species at hydrothermal vents on the Southwest Indian Ridge \[ **3.5**\], and the adaptations of the abundant ""scaly\-foot snail"" from those vents \[ **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The overall relationship between our underpinning research outputs and key impact\-generating activities in each area of engagement was as follows: 



 Details of activities and impacts for each area \( **4.1** to **4.4**\) are presented below. Evidence for **reach** is provided by information about audiences for our activities. **Significance** is demonstrated by: 

-  results from evaluations incorporated in activities to assess achievement of engagement goals; 

-  recognition of our engagement activities in international awards; 

-  newspaper & magazine reviews of popular science book featuring our underpinning research; 

-  testimonials from media professionals \(e.g. BBC Natural History Unit\) with whom we worked; 

-  evidence such as audience feedback, using principles from our previous experience \[ **5.11**\]. 

 **\(4.1\) Documentaries and broadcasts:** We worked with BBC producers to feature results from our research in documentary series broadcast since 2014 \[ **5.1**\]. For example, results and deep\-sea footage from our investigation of Southern Ocean hydrothermal vents and the reproductive ecology of the ""Hoff"" crab \(underpinning outputs \[ **3.3**\+ **3.4**\]\) featured in *Atlantic: The Wildest Ocean on Earth*, shown on BBC Two on 06 August 2015 and reaching 2.1 million viewers on first broadcast, subsequently broadcast as *Wild Atlantic* across Europe, internationally on BBC Earth, and released on DVD, iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime, Netflix. 

 *Blue Planet II* \(episode 2: *The Deep*; first broadcast 05 November 2017\) featured footage and results from the same underpinning research \[ **3.3\+3.4**\]; for reach of impact, that episode was the 2<sup>nd</sup> most\-viewed TV programme of 2017 in the UK, watched by 13.97 million people for its first transmission, subsequently broadcast in >30 other countries \(including 80 million viewers in China\), and released on DVD, iTunes, Google Play, and Netflix, with an overall global reach now estimated to approach one billion people \[ **5.2**\]. The content that we provided was also specifically highlighted by the BBC in pre\-publicity for the series, receiving widespread press coverage \[ **S1**\], indicating significance of impact from engaging the producers of the series with our research. 

 Testimonials from the producers with whom we worked \[ **5.2**\+ **5.3**\] provide evidence for significance of impact from our engagement with the BBC Natural History Unit, such as: *""we were able to shine a light on the newly discovered Hoff Crab and the new world of the South Sandwich Island hydrothermal vents… and to remind our audience of up to a billion people around the world just how little we still know about the deep...* *to do so in collaboration with Dr Copley, who is a gifted communicator as well as a scientist, meant our ability to raise awareness of fragile ocean ecosystems had as great an impact as possible""* \(\[ **5.2**\]; *Blue Planet II* producer Orla Doherty\) and *""Our story was based on research observations documenting the extreme lengths the female Hoff crab goes to, in order to protect her eggs… It is precisely this type of 'character\-led' drama that draws new audiences to TV documentaries that feature the natural world… Incorporation of such footage dramatically lifted the aspirations of the series, since a public service broadcaster couldn't possibly film these environments""* \(\[ **5.3**\]; *Atlantic* producer Ted Giffords\). Our interaction with these media professionals also taught us how to shoot deep\-sea footage during our research to meet the specific needs of documentary makers \[ **S3**\], building our capability to bring our work to wider audiences through that medium for our engagement goals. 

 In addition to TV series, we worked with radio documentary makers to feature results from our research on biodiversity at Indian Ocean hydrothermal vents \(underpinning outputs \[ **3.5**\+ **3.6**\]\) in *The Compass: Ocean Stories*, broadcast in November 2017 on BBC World Service, which has a global reach of 75 million \[ **3.1**\], though it is not possible to track total audience across countries for a specific programme. Our research investigating hydrothermal vent environments and their biodiversity in the Cayman Trough \(outputs \[ **3.1**\+ **3.2**\]\) provided content for *Into The Abyss* on BBC Radio 4 \(July 2014\), which highlighted the issue of deep\-sea mining and its potential environmental impacts.  We also worked with an independent film\-maker to produce a short film, *Hydrothermal Vents: What Does The Future Hold?*, about our Cayman Trough research and the context of deep\-sea mining, which was shortlisted as a finalist in the Emerging Film\-maker category at the international *Blue Ocean Film Festival* in 2014 \[ **3.1**\]. 

 **\(4.2\) Online engagement:** We created a ""Massive Open Online Course"" \(MOOC\) about *Exploring Our Ocean* to introduce people with no prior scientific background to the exploration of deep\-sea environments and their biodiversity. Our online programme was designed for public engagement with our work, and included data and results from our research at Cayman Trough hydrothermal vents \[ **3.1**\+ **3.2**\]. The programme ran ""live"" over several weeks each year from 2014 through 2020 \(a total of 14 runs\), with PhD students answering questions in discussion forums as participants explored topics through course videos \(including footage from our underpinning research\), simple data interpretation \(including data from our underpinning research\), and reading \(including news media coverage of our research\). 

 Since its first run in 2014, the *Exploring Our Oceans* MOOC has had >52,000 enrolments from people in 183 countries, posting >41,000 online comments and questions \[ **5.5**\]. To evaluate significance of impact for the MOOC, we included ""before and after"" questions to capture changes in participants' awareness of deep\-sea environments and their biodiversity, and to assess other outcomes for our engagement goals of ""providing cultural enrichment by supporting lifelong learning"" and ""raising awareness of our research insights and their context"". Examples of participant feedback \[ **5.4**\] consistent with achieving those goals include *""Might sound odd but this has changed my life and inspired me beyond anything before and I'm nudging 50\!""* and *""Basically my point of view has changed. Instead of marvelling at how wonderful the deep\-sea creatures are, I came to realize it is necessary that we must do our utmost to protect them"".* 

 In addition, an HEA\-funded study of the impact of our MOOC \[ **5.4**\] conducted detailed follow\-up interviews with 453 participants from the initial run of *Exploring Our Oceans*, providing further evidence for significance of impacts consistent with our engagement goals: 100% of those interviewed *""learned about the results of current research""* during the MOOC, and 97% *""learned something that changed the way I view an issue""*. We also assessed the impact of the MOOC on the ""ocean literacy"" of participants, publishing our results and sharing our experience in a peer\-reviewed paper \[ **5.5**\], and our MOOC was Highly Commended in the Projects category of *The Ocean Awards 2016*, sponsored by the Blue Marine Foundation and Boat International Media to recognise impact in engagement with the ocean \[ **5.4**\]. 

 For online engagement in 2020 we also worked with the producers and presenters of *Let's Go Live\!*, a YouTube series for those home\-schooling children during Covid\-19 lockdown, bringing our findings about the ecology of hydrothermal vent shrimp \[ **3.2**\] to >5,000 households during the live show and subsequently reaching >25,000 online views in total \[ **5.6**\]. Underpinning research \[ **3.5**\+ **3.6**\] featured in the *Guardian* Science Weekly podcast in January 2020, distributed via platforms including Apple, Google, Spotify and SoundCloud, preventing tracking of total audiences but with listener feedback including comments such as *""science communication at its best""* \[ **5.1**\]. In November 2020, underpinning research \[ **3.3**\] featured in the *BBC Science Focus* podcast series *Everything you ever wanted to know about… the deep sea with Dr Jon Copley*, distributed internationally via platforms including Acast, iTunes, Stitcher, and Overcast \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **\(4.3\) In\-person engagement and ""popular science"" book:** In total, we delivered >50 in\-person engagement events about our underpinning research to a total audience of >86,000 people during the REF period, and worked with a professional event producer and presenter who featured our research in 22 further events to an additional audience of \~8,600 people. Our in\-person programme targeted four specific communities of place and interest: \(1\) local communities in the southern UK where we are based; \(2\) school pupils and their families and teachers; \(3\) lifelong learners; and \(4\) users of the marine environment \(recreational & professional\). A full list of the events that we delivered ourselves, with audience information and feedback, is provided in \[ **5.7**\]. 

 In 2015 Copley won a NERC ""Summer Of Science"" grant for public engagement, which we used to deliver a session of talks at the annual British Science Festival and create exhibits for the Southampton Boat Show, ""Science Uncovered"" at the Natural History Museum, and NERC's "" *RRS Discovery* in London"" programme, featuring all our underpinning research. The 2015 events reached >28,000 people in total, and we evaluated impact using audience questionnaires for our talks and a touch\-screen system for our exhibits, with results \[ **5.8**\] providing evidence of raising awareness of deep\-sea environments and their biodiversity, such as 84% of those polled not being previously aware that UK Overseas Territories include habitats such as hydrothermal vents. 

 Our subsequent in\-person programme from 2016 to 2018 included major events such as the Bluedot Festival in 2016 and 2018 \(audience \~1,200 people\); *New Scientist Live* Main Stage 2018 \(\~3,000 people\); ""R3A at the Royal Institution"" 2017 \(\~300 lifelong learners\); and keynote talks at European Maritime Day 2017 \(\~800 professional users of the marine environment\) and the Royal Society of Biology Education Awards 2018 \(\~300 school pupils & teachers\). 

 In addition, our research on Southern Ocean hydrothermal vents and the ecology of the ""Hoff"" crab \[ **3.3**\+ **3.4**\] featured in 22 ""Deep Ocean Lab"" school & family festival engagement events delivered by science presenter Greg Foot during 2017 to 2020 to a total audience of 8,600 school pupils, their family members, and teachers \[ **5.6**\]. His testimonial highlights the significance of impact from incorporating material from our underpinning research: *""Both the deep\-sea vent  footage, and showing the actual physical Crab to the audience \(albeit in perspex\), brought the scientific adventure and research to life… lots of follow up questions showing significant engagement and passion for ocean science""*. 

 Dialogue with audiences at our events from August 2013 through 2018 informed the content and format for the ""popular science"" book *Ask an Ocean Explorer,* written by Copley and published by Hodder & Stoughton in 2019, featuring results from all our underpinning research and sharing our research process. The book received positive reviews in newspapers and magazines \[ **5.9**\], with comments demonstrating our goal of raising awareness of deep\-sea environments and their biodiversity, such as: "" *deftly conjures the wonders of a bathynaut's world""* \( *Nature*\); *""an engaging book sprinkled with mind\-blowing facts about the deep ocean""* \( *Daily Express*\); *""a new informed perspective on the wide, watery world we inhabit""* \( *Coast* magazine Book Of The Month, May 2019\). UK paperback sales averaged \~160 per week by the end of 2019 \[ **5.9**\]. 

 Publication of the book led to a 20\-date *Ask an Ocean Explorer* national tour of talks delivered by Copley in 2019 to engage people with our underpinning research, supported by the publisher whose testimonial records *""unprecedented demand""* from literary festivals and that audiences were *""animated, better informed, and brimming with discussion on leaving his talks, resulting in great book sales""* \[ **5.9**\]. Examples of feedback from event organisers and audience members \[ **5.7**\] indicating achievement of our engagement goals included: *""wonderful talk on the creatures of the deep and our impact on the oceans… best questions ever from the youngsters in the audience""* and *""an amazing and inspiring talk about deep sea life and biodiversity""*. 

 Beyond the *Ask an Ocean Explorer* tour, our programme of other in\-person engagement events for 2019\-2020 included Gresham College, the UK’s oldest public lecture series \(live audience of >300 lifelong learners and >2,800 viewers online \[ **5.7**\]\) and the *Monsters Of The Deep* exhibition at the National Maritime Museum in Falmouth \(37,276 visitors July\-December 2020 \[ **5.7**\]\), for which Copley was a guest curator, creating a display featuring our underpinning research on Southern Ocean hydrothermal vents and the ""Hoff"" crab \[ **3.3**\+ **3.4**\]. 

 **\(4.4\) Policymaker engagement:** Our goal of raising awareness of deep\-sea environments and their biodiversity included engaging policymakers with results from our underpinning research, by contributing to briefings and reports on the topic of deep\-sea resources \[ **5.10**\], after Copley was selected for the Royal Society’s Parliamentary Pairing Scheme in 2014. Results from our research on biodiversity at Indian Ocean hydrothermal vents \[ **3.5**\+ **3.6**\] were described in the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology \(POST\) Briefing Note on Deep\-sea Mining \(2015\). The Royal Society's *Future Ocean Resources* report in 2017 for the Government Office for Science \(GO Science\), for which Mills was a Working Group Member, specifically cited \[ **3.5**\] and was distributed to parliamentarians, government departments, and NGOs. Copley was also invited to present findings from this underpinning research \[ **3.5**\+ **3.6**\] to the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee in 2018, and to write an article about those results for *Science In Parliament* \(Autumn 2018 issue\), published by the Committee to \~600 parliamentarians and civil servants. 

 We highlighted results from our research at Indian Ocean hydrothermal vents \[ **3.5**\] in written evidence from Copley to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee \(EAC\) inquiry on Sustainable Seas in 2018, to which Mills was also invited to submit oral evidence. A key result from that underpinning research was described in the Committee's final report to government \(page 32 of the report \[ **5.10**\]\) and mentioned specifically in discussion of the report in the House of Commons chamber on 17 January 2019 \(Hansard, vol 652 col 1358 \[ **5.10**\]\), informing a UK policy recommendation for a moratorium on mining active hydrothermal vents. In December 2020, Copley was the UK's invited participant in the UN International Seabed Authority workshop developing an international framework for environmental management of mid\-ocean ridge ecosystems.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Hannah Lambie\-Mumford’s pioneering research into UK hunger has fundamentally changed the way NGOs, politicians and the public understand the rise of food charity and household food insecurity in the UK. Her research underpinned NGO and public campaigns for rights\-based responses to hunger \[Text removed for publication\]. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Lambie\-Mumford’s research has set out clearly, for the first time, the drivers and nature of modern food charity as a response to contemporary household food insecurity in the UK, and the implications for social and economic human rights. Her research \[R1\-R5\] highlighted the importance of structural determinants of food insecurity and the food charity response, setting out the need for systematic rights\-based responses. These findings were also some of the first to highlight the important role that welfare reform and austerity played in driving the need for \- and growth of \- emergency food charity. The primary research \[R1\-R2, R4\-R5\] was undertaken using qualitative methods and involved in depth case studies of the largest food charity networks in the UK. Quantitative research methods were used for R3, drawing on Trussell Trust food bank network data. 

 Key findings included: 

 F1. There is a close relationship between welfare reform and the rise of food charity, with reforms since 2010 driving the need for, and influencing the shape of, charitable food provision. \[R1\-R5\]. 

 F1.a. Cuts in service provision, reduced and increasingly conditional social security provision and social security administration processes have increased the numbers of people relying on emergency food provision \[R1\-R5\]. 

 F1.b. Welfare diversification policies \(1997 and 2010\) have structurally embedded expectations that the voluntary sector will take increasing responsibility for responding to poverty in local communities \[R1, R2\]. 

 F2. From a human rights perspective \(both in terms of the human right to food and social rights more broadly\), food charity systems are ultimately not adequate. Food charity systems are ultimately not an adequate response to a lack of access to food. By their nature they are not universal or based on rights or entitlements. The provision of food assistance through these systems is socially unacceptable, unsustainable, vulnerable and unaccountable by human rights standards \[R1\-R5\]. 

 F3. The state has retrenched its social provision extensively since 2010 and retreated from its duty to respect, protect and fulfil the human right to food. Emergency food provision is assuming the responsibility to fulfil this right. \[R1, R4\-R5\] 

 F4. The human right to food could be a particularly useful framework for pursuing structural responses to hunger in the context of contemporary poverty and food policy making in the UK. It enables a wide range of stakeholders, actors, and interests to be considered in the process of pursuing the realisation of the right. \[R1, R4\-R5\] 

 Based on these findings, the research recommendations included the following: 

-  That food charities should focus on advocacy and campaigning work at local, devolved, and national levels \[R1\]. 

-  Government should establish and fund a regular systematic measure of food insecurity in the UK \[R1 and R5\]. 

-  Government\-led policy responses are urgently required, based on rights and entitlements \[R1\-R2, R4\-R5\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dr Lambie\-Mumford’s research has underpinned NGO and public campaigns for rights\-based responses to household food insecurity. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 The research has underpinned three key outcomes: 

1.  NGOs are more effective campaigners because they have been able to draw on a robust evidence base to build the case for hunger as a rights issue requiring state\-based, as opposed to charitable, responses. 

1.  The public has a better understanding of the ‘right to food’ which has driven local campaigning and activism, in turn enhancing the effectiveness of NGO campaigns.

 Transforming NGO understanding of household food insecurity and establishing the pivotal End Hunger UK campaign 

 Major NGOs including Church Action on Poverty \(CAP\), Oxfam, Save the Children and nine others joined parliamentarians and campaign group Feeding Britain at a Westminster roundtable event in September 2015 to focus on how NGOs could apply Lambie\-Mumford’s research findings. The event was called ‘The Right to Food: a different way of thinking about food poverty’, and was hosted by the Bishop of Truro, Co\-Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Food Poverty and Hunger. The CAP Director said the NGOs did not previously have a history of working together before this point, but the research provided both the evidence and catalyst to make them more effective campaigners: 

 “*\[We\] realised that the added value of working together was very clear, based on the research findings. In more than 20 years of campaigning against poverty, I have never seen such coherence and appetite across multiple NGOs for a joint campaign based on academic research*” \[S2\]. 

 By considering their campaigns through Lambie\-Mumford’s ‘right to food’ lens \[R1,4,5\], NGOs now had an evidence\-base to approach the campaign collectively on a human rights platform. Following this event CAP was able to secure agreement from the NGOs to collaborate on a national ‘right to food’ campaign, based on Lambie\-Mumford’s findings \[F1\-4\] \- this became ‘End Hunger UK’, launched in October 2016. The first End Hunger UK national conference in October 2017 was attended by 150 delegates. Jackie Long, Channel 4 News Social Affairs editor chaired the session, and was joined on the panel by Alison Garnham, Chief Executive of Child Poverty Action Group; Sharon Hodgson MP, Shadow Public Health Minister and Lambie\-Mumford \[S3\]. The conference generated significant media coverage, featuring on Channel 4 News and BBC News. Over 18,000 individuals and 140 groups have since taken action as part of End Hunger UK by signing petitions, writing to their MPs, attending conferences and other events \[S4\]. 

 Improved public understanding of the right to food, leading to activism and citizen empowerment 

 The research identified the importance of the right to food approach as a lever for pursuing more structural responses to hunger \[F4\]. Lambie\-Mumford worked with CAP to design a successful grassroots outreach programme in 2015, working with local activists to embed the ‘right to food’ campaign narrative. CAP facilitated two workshops in 2015 in Halifax and Salford. The sessions drew together 20 experts by experience of food poverty to discuss the research findings \[F1\-4\] alongside their own lived experiences, and how far they felt that the ‘right to food’ could be a meaningful and useful way to advocate for effective policy changes \[F4\]. Participants spoke about feeling empowered and enlightened by the findings \[S2\]. Before this engagement work there had been very little national\-scale public discussion of the human right to food in the UK, particularly in a church context. CAP was able to deliver further grassroots engagement and enhance public understanding based on the findings: 

 They published a video drawing on these lived experiences and the research findings \[F2 and F4\] which has been viewed online over 805 times \[S5\]. 

-  ‘Right to Food Sunday’. CAP made the right to food the theme of their national ‘Church Action on Poverty Sunday’ on 7th February 2016, producing free hardcopy and downloadable worship and reflection materials. They were used in an estimated 700 churches across the country. Without the findings, CAP would have been unable to produce this engagement programme and inform an estimated minimum 42,000 people about their ‘right to food’ \[S2, S5 and S6\]. 

-  CAP ‘Right to Food’ roadshow. From 2015 into spring 2016, CAP launched a series of roadshows based on Lambie\-Mumford’s findings. The roadshow presentations were called ‘Right to Food’, and were delivered in collaboration with the Fabian Society in 20 towns and cities across the UK to 795 people. \[S2, S5\]. 

-  Importantly, this activity and engagement work made a significant difference to the experts by experience who took part in the grassroots work: 

  -  A grassroots participant from Salford appeared on the BBC’s ‘Breakfast’ programme to talk about the right to food. Average  [<ins>viewing figures</ins>](https://www.thebubble.org.uk/culture/television/bbc-vs-gmb-the-battle-for-breakfast-supremacy/) are 1.5 million. 

  -  A grassroots participant set up his own local Right to Food campaign in Halifax, spoke at local schools and became a CAP trustee. He also spoke at the 2015 Westminster debate to establish End Hunger UK \[S2, S5\]. 

  -  Another grassroots participant from Salford was nominated for a Salix community award for ‘campaigns against the stigma of people on benefits’. Salix is a multi\-award\-winning social housing provider based in Salford \[S7\]. 

 This community engagement was significant for CAP, not only in terms of the large numbers of outreach participation, but it enhanced their work and role as a community empowerment body, which is part of CAP’s mission \[S2\]. With the roadshows, and empowering those with lived experience of food poverty through engaging with the research findings \[F1\-3, R5\], CAP changed its approach to outreach delivery: “ *Without the Lambie\-Mumford research findings, we would have been unable to produce this engagement programme and inform an estimated minimum 4,200 people about their ‘right to food”* \[S2\]. 

 Research used as part of the evidence base to make the case for a national Government measure of household food insecurity 

 Lambie\-Mumford’s findings \[R1\-3, F1\-3\] identified the need for state\-based responses to hunger based on rights and entitlements, better monitoring and cross\-governmental working. Household food insecurity has been an active policy concept in the UK government since the mid\-2000s. However, government understanding of the scale of household food insecurity was – and remained until 2019 – limited, relying on proxy measures such as food prices, which fail to account for the experiential and dynamic aspects of household access to food. 

 Following on from Lambie\-Mumford’s ‘right to food’ outreach work with CAP based on her research findings, CAP worked with Emma Lewell\-Buck MP to host a parliamentary roundtable in January 2018 to discuss the recommendations of the ‘Step up to the Plate’ report \[R5\] written by CAP and Lambie\-Mumford. One of the five recommendations called for the government to adopt a household food insecurity measure. The roundtable was attended by cross\-party senior parliamentarians and ministers, as well as key NGOs including the Food Foundation, Oxfam and the Trussell Trust. Emma Lewell Buck MP, then Shadow Minister for Education \(Children and Families\), consequently tabled a Food Insecurity Bill calling for the systematic measurement of household food insecurity in the UK, drawing directly on Lambie\-Mumford’s findings and citing her research \[R5\] on the Bill webpage \[S8\]. The Bill was a key part of the wider End Hunger UK campaign to press the government to measure household food insecurity. \[Text removed for publication\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Consumer music playback has remained largely unchanged since the birth of recording; music is fixed at the point of release and playback sounds identical on each listen. An AHRC\-funded research led to the development of an iOS app\-format called variPlay which changed that. It enables either listeners or an algorithm to manipulate musical content as it is played and hear a unique version – eﬀectively a remix – every time. The app had commercial impact through collaboration with Warner Music Group and the British Phonographic Institute, and several international artists released music in the format. The project greatly extended understanding of the commercial issues to be addressed in the wider use of interactive music. There has also been impact on creativity through the artists engaged with the project and on public appreciation of the potential of interactive music. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research for this impact was primarily derived from an AHRC\-funded project *Transforming Digital Music: Investigating Interactive Playback* \(Oct 2014 to July 2015\) which developed a unique interactive\-music album format with the potential to transform the way we listen to and engage with digital music. This innovative technology allowed users to manipulate and interact with music in ways that had not previously been possible, bringing new user experiences and opened artistic and commercial opportunities for music artists and the music industry. 

 Research was conducted by Paterson at UWL in collaboration with Professor Rob Toulson, then of Anglia Ruskin University. Paterson led on the algorithmic functional operation and architecture, C\+\+ coding of the audio engine and development of novel music\-production workflows. Both researchers contributed to testing and evaluation, and to writing outputs. 

 The principal output of this research was a ground\-breaking iOS application \(app\) that represented this new format of music release, with that specific app delivering a commercial release of the music of artist *Daisy and The Dark* as a pilot. The app – variPlay – packaged an EP as an app with real\-time dynamic playback capabilities. The technology allowed users to manipulate and interact with music in new ways. In addition, the format packaged rich media such as lyrics, photographs, production credits, Internet links and song/artist information. \[R1\] 

 In operation, a song can be listened to by the consumer in several different ways. The song might be an upbeat rock\-genre track including drums, guitars, vocals and a string section. Consider however, that the listener might want to enjoy listening to the song in a more relaxed manner – a unique experience based on the listener’s mood at that moment. In real time, they might use a simple gesture on their phone to morph towards a stripped\-down version, perhaps with the electric guitars replaced by acoustic versions, the drums becoming hand percussion and the strings taking a more prominent role in the mix. It is still the same song, maintaining the artistry intended by the musician, but now changed to give the listener a different experience. 

 A unique feature of the app is that it could anonymously report geo\-located user interaction with different modes of listening of a single song. Development of the app featured an innovative algorithmic audio\-processing system, a unique graphical interface and a novel audio cross\-fading system. 

 The technical phase of the project generated intellectual property around the intelligent audio cross\-fades that were developed. A UK patent was filed in 2015 and a subsequent international patent was filed the following year and published in 2017. \[R2\] 

 In order to protect the intellectual property and enable future commercial impact, initial publication was limited to a book chapter \[R3\] although the findings were discussed at a number of international conferences including in Denmark, Poland, Slovenia and several times in the USA. 

 The AHRC subsequently invited an application to fund a follow\-on project, *The Commercialisation of Interactive Music* \(Oct 2017 to Oct 2018 *\)* on which Paterson was PI. This enabled the researchers to work with the Warner Music Group in taking the technological 'shell' of the variPlay app and repopulating it with the music, images, and text of two major international Warner artists. \[R4, R5\] The impact generated from the follow\-on project is summarised in section 4 of this case study. 

 An autoethnography of the variPlay project was published in 2019 in which the concept and operation of the app is discussed, alongside reflection on product development, music production, mastering, and issues encountered through the commercialization itself. \[R6\]

 The variPlay app has contributed to the wider understanding and commercial opportunities for interactive music, as well as providing a new opportunity for creative artists to develop and release material in this format reaching wide audiences. 

####  Widening public understanding of interactive music 

 The development of variPlay contributed to expanding public understanding of interactive music. The initial pilot with *Daisy and the Dark* – called ‘Red Planet’ – generated positive feedback from a focus group of the public with 93% of respondents rating the experience as excellent or good, and 90% would be willing to purchase. Comments from the focus group included: 

 “It's a brilliant initiative, the App shows just what is possible in multimedia formats” 

 “Really interesting concept, professional and creative” 

 “Just listening and watching a review of the app as an aspiring songwriter, the app definitely interested me into exploring different styles in my own music and writing”. 

 Working with *Daisy and the Dark*, variPlay was demonstrated at the Victoria and Albert Museum’s Digital Design Weekend in both 2016 and 2017. More than 46,000 people attended these events. \[S1\] 

 ‘Red Planet’ has been downloaded 2080 times; the data on this showed it was popular in the UK, but also in China and the USA, and reached Africa, India, Middle East, and Latin America. Data mining indicated that users spent 30% longer engaging with the music than a non\-interactive ‘control’ version. 

 The app was featured on Cambridge TV; at the Cambridge Science Festival; the NESTA Serious Play event; in a Times Higher Education Research Supplement; on AHRC news pages; by invitation at Music Tech Fest \(2015 Slovenia\) and ‘AI for Music Workshop’ \(2019 Shanghai\); and adopted as a host for a Sino\-UK AI\-in\-music development project. 

 Subsequent apps were featured when Paterson discussed variPlay in a June 2019 BBC World Service / Open University programme ‘The Future of Music Technology’ hosted by Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason \(BBC estimate: 10 million listeners worldwide\). \[S2\] 

####  Industry take\-up of variPlay 

 The ‘Red Planet’ app generated considerable interest within the music and technology industries, with high praise for its intuitive interactive features and the collaboration achieved between the two industries. 

 A custom\-built version of the app was presented by the British Phonographic Institute to the UK record industry as an innovative deployment of technology and featured as ‘record of the day’ in August 2018. \[S3\] 

 Five further apps have been released globally to date in the variPlay format, following on from the ‘Red Planet’ pilot. \[S4\] 

 The most extensive take\-up of variPlay came from the Warner Music Group \(WMG\), who collaborated with Paterson and Toulson in their AHRC follow\-on project.  These releases were from Ximena Sarinana \(released 2018 by WMG; Warner Music Mexico\) and by Ofenbach \(released 2019 by WMG; Elektra France\).  The two WMG releases gained traction in targeted markets: Ximena Sariñana had 741k impressions and 1.6k downloads mostly in Mexico, but also in Bolivia, Colombia, the USA and Paraguay. Ofenbach had 23.5k impressions and 1.1k downloads mostly in France, but also Russia, China, UK and USA, and achieved \#1 French Music App, and \#103 overall in the French App Store. The tracks have had more than 63m plays on Spotify and over 20m views on YouTube. 

 There were also releases by *Asympt Man* \(2018, independent\); by *Defab1 ft. Vanessa Knight* \(2018, Regent Street Records\); with a further release by *Langham Research Centre* \(2020, Nonclassical\) – more than 400 further downloads. 

####  Commercialisation of interactive music 

 The project has successfully helped to reveal the wide range of issues that need to be addressed to facilitate the commercialisation of interactive and dynamic music. 

 The Head of Creative and Digital at WMG said: 

 Partnering with the variPlay project presented a unique opportunity for Warner Music, through which we could explore the appetite for interactive music across our international range of record labels and roster of artists. The project precipitated considerable discussion within our organisation in terms of seeing ‘stems’ in a new light and started many international conversations about how ‘interactive recorded music’ might be deployed, marketed and sold. 

 Only by going through this process could we understand the appetite for interactive and dynamic music in different territories, including Europe, Asia and LatAm – amongst both the industry and artist audiences. There was notable impact on those labels and territories that released variPlay apps for their artist campaigns, in terms of conceptualisation of interactive audio products, and also audience reaction – and previously, this notion was new to them. 

 It is they who are now best placed to judge further innovations of this kind, and Warner Music will look to them to draw from their experiences for future high\-technology music releases. \[S5\] 

 The Product Manager for Warner France said: “94% of clicks come from lookalike audiences\! This shows a real interest of ‘non\-fans’ in this kind of new tech experience and allows us to reach potential new Ofenbach fans\!” 

 The project informed industry on how to take app\-based interactive music forward.  It showed how to marry technical innovation with industry business models; indicated some potential difficulties in engaging established artists and their management teams with these novel approaches; and highlighted the limited reach of an iOS app in countries where Android dominated. 

####  Artists’ responses to variPlay 

 The artists engaged by the project responded to the creative opportunities it offered.  Sarah Kayte Foster of *Daisy and The Dark* said that the variPlay platform allowed an “experience where the digital listener feels like they have a visual and physical relationship with music again.” \[S6.\] 

 Avant\-garde classical ensemble *Langham Research Centre* said: 

 variPlay has been a thought\-provoking and absorbing project for Langham Research Centre to be involved with. It has led us to consider the act of composing in a fundamentally different way, as a mutable process that is no longer fixed. This will have a major impact on the way we approach our music from now on. Furthermore, and equally fundamentally, our involvement in variPlay suggests a new relationship between the artist and their audience, allowing the latter considerable agency over the way they want to listen to the music we make. This is a far less top\-down approach which challenges the way we have traditionally composed music for commercial release. This too will have significant ramifications on the way we proceed as a group. \[S7\] 

 Artists perceive variPlay not just as a creative opportunity, but as something that impacts upon the ontology of their practice. Further, they clearly feel a more potent connection to their audiences when releasing pre\-recorded music with the ‘live’ elements that variPlay elicits.

 1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This issue of job quality has long been at the forefront of national and international policy agenda, but there is a shortage of empirical evidence on how to improve job quality. Drawing on large scale European labour market data, Dr Ying Zhou’s research \(co\-authored with Professor Duncan Callie\) highlights the impact of employee involvement on work motivation, skill development and subjective well\-being. Her work provides strong support for the view that there are mutual benefits of high involvement for both employees and employers. This research influenced the OECD Job Quality Framework and the associated Guidelines to implement and monitor the Framework. The EU has used the research to build the argument for better member state national policies on well\-being at work. The research is also used in English and Welsh policies to support improved job quality. 
","
 2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the last decade, there has been a resurgence of interest in the issue of job quality following the European Council’s Lisbon Growth and Job Strategy that calls for the creation of ‘more and better jobs’ as a central policy goal for the European Union. Dr Ying Zhou’s research focuses on job quality which lies at the interface of national and international policies to improve economic growth and competitiveness on the one hand and policies to reinforce employees’ social rights and personal well\-being on the other. There has been a long debate on whether these economic and social objectives are mutually reinforcing rather than requiring a trade\-off of benefits. Over the last decade Dr Ying Zhou has published extensively on the impact of employee involvement on work motivation \[3.1, 3.3, 3.4\], skill development \[3.2, 3.4, 3.5\] and subjective well\-being \[3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6\], showing that there are benefits for both employees and employers when high involvement is encouraged. 

 In 2012 and again in 2019, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions \(Eurofound\) invited Dr Ying Zhou \(with Professor Duncan Gallie from Oxford University\) to provide research evidence on the forms of work organisation that encourage both labour productivity and employee well\-being across the EU member states. Drawing on data in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> European Working Conditions Surveys, their reports Work Organization and Employee Involvement in Europe \[3.3\] and Employee Involvement, Work Engagement and Skill Development \[3.4\] show that employees in high involvement organisations, characterised by higher levels of job autonomy and wider organisational participation, experience a wide range of positive outcomes such as safer physical working conditions, stronger work motivation, greater learning and skill development opportunities and better physical and psychological well\-being. The main findings from the second report were published as an EU policy brief in English, French, German and Spanish in June 2020 \[3.5\]. 

 Despite the wide range of benefits associated with high involvement organisations, the majority of employees in Europe were found to be employed in low involvement organisations where individuals lack discretion over their work tasks and have little say over broader organisational decisions that affect them \[3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]. Employees in the Nordic countries stand out as having the highest levels of involvement while those in southern and south\-eastern European countries are subjected to particularly tight managerial control. These differences remain evident even after controlling for economic structure and workforce composition, which points to the role of national policies in promoting inclusiveness at work. Furthermore, the differences in job quality between countries appear impervious to the impact of the economic crisis. Drawing on the European Social Survey series, they compared job quality in nineteen European countries before and after the 2008\-9 economic recession and found little change in the pattern by country or region \[3.6\]. These findings testify to the stability of institutional arrangements in the face of short\-term economic shocks, reflecting their embeddedness in complex and interdependent formal rule systems. 

 In sum, the research shows that the twin objectives of economic growth and employee well\-being can be achieved through the adoption of high involvement management. Encouraging employee involvement in workplace decision\-making will not only satisfy individuals’ inherent needs for self\-determination but also increase work motivation and skill development, which will lead to smart, inclusive and sustainable economic growth.

 4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dr Ying Zhou’s cross\-national comparative research on job quality has informed national and international policies designed to improve job quality through the OECD, the European Commission and in England and Wales. 

  

 <ins>OECD policy</ins> 

 In 2013, Dr Ying Zhou and Professor Duncan Gallie were invited to present their research on job autonomy and work intensity \[3.6\] at the OECD in Paris, in preparation for the development of the OECD Job Quality Framework. This workshop was attended by Jean\-Paul Tricart \(Head of Unit for Social Dialogue and Industrial Relations, European Commission\), Marco Mira D’Ercole \(Head of Household Statistics and Progress Measurement Division, OECD\) and Mark Keese \(Head of Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs\). Mark Keese oversaw the subsequent development of the OECD Job Quality Framework \[5.1\], while Alexander Hijzen, who moderated the Q&A at the workshop, drafted the Framework. The Framework identified three broad dimensions of job quality: earnings, labour market security and quality of the working environment. Job autonomy, as identified in Dr Zhou’s presentation, was recognised as a key aspect of a good working environment \[5.1, p18\-19\] \[5.2\]. The OECD Job Quality Framework was officially adopted in the G20 Labour and Employment Ministers’ Ankara Declaration in 2015 \[5.3\]. At the Heads of States Summit, Ministers of Labour and Employment from G20 members and invited countries accepted the importance of job quality as a policy goal, acknowledging that ‘quality jobs are important as a key driver of greater well\-being for individuals and society” \[5.3 Clause 23 Annex IV\]. 

 To facilitate the implementation of the policy recommendations from the Job Quality Framework, the OECD was asked by the G20 members to create Guidelines on Measuring the Quality of the Working Environment \[5.4\]. The Guidelines were launched at the EU’s Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg in 2017 which gathered heads of state and social partners to work on well\-functioning and fair European labour markets, effective and sustainable social protection systems and the promotion of social dialogue at all levels. Dr Ying Zhou’s research on the distribution and trends in employee involvement in Europe was cited five times in the Guidelines document \[5.4, Chapter 3\]. The research is cited in support of the fact that ‘reliable data available for monitoring the quality of the working environment is essential for policy \[…\] to improve working conditions’ \[5.4 p58\]. In particular, knowledge of the sectors of the workforce which are particularly vulnerable to poor working environment is essential for developing effective policy interventions to improve employee well\-being. 

  

 <ins>European policy</ins> 

 Dr Ying Zhou was invited to present her research at Eurofound \(European Union’s main research agency on working conditions\) at a series of meetings held in Dublin and Brussels \[5.5\]. In 2014 her research \[3.3\] was presented at a joint workshop by the European Commission and OECD in Brussels and cited in the subsequently published 2015 European Commission policy document Employment and Social Developments in Europe \[5.6\] ‘which informed EU policies to improve organisational effectiveness and employee welfare.’ \[5.5\]. The research was used to indicate that work intensity can be beneficial when combined with choice, and to recognise that job autonomy is embedded in wider institutional structures. 

 In 2019 Dr Ying Zhou presented her research in Dublin to Eurofound’s Senior Advisory Committee which consists of representatives from governments, employers and trade unions from EU member states. The research was later presented to the Dutch Prime Minister’s Scientific Council and the European Council’s Working Party on Social Questions during the Finnish Presidency. In June 2020, the EU released Council Conclusions on Enhancing Well\-being at Work which used the research \[3.3\] to support the call for enhanced employee involvement \[5.7\] and more broadly called on member states to develop policies to support the well\-being at work agenda. This is acknowledged by Eurofound as “a significant achievement, in particular, as work organisation issue traditionally falls under the concept of subsidiarity, highlighting thus the original and ground\-breaking contributions that the report is making.” \[5.5\]. The Conclusions are supported by a policy brief \[5.8\] published by Eurofound and co\-authored by Dr Ying Zhou, which is used to ‘inform EU labour market policies’ \[5.5\]. 

  

 <ins>UK policy</ins> 

 Dr Ying Zhou’s research has also influenced UK government policy on job quality and employee well\-being. In 2013, Professor Duncan Gallie presented their joint research \[3.3, 3.6\] on the impact of economic recession on job quality in Europe to the Cabinet Office at No 10 Downing Street, with a particular focus on employee involvement. Their research was cited in the subsequently published 2014 UK Wellbeing and Policy Report authored by the former Cabinet Secretary Lord Gus O’Donnell and other prominent social scientists \[5.9\]. More recently Dr Ying Zhou drafted the Good Work Index Report \[5.10\] for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development \(CIPD\) which uses it to support its 150,000 members in HR to improve the quality of working lives. 

 Finally, Dr Ying Zhou’s research \[3.3, 3.6\] has also influenced Welsh Government policy. Recognising the importance of fair work for achieving a modernised and inclusive economy, the First Minister commissioned Professor Linda Dickens MBE to Chair the Fair Work Commission and make recommendations to improve job quality. ‘Fair Work Wales’ was published in May 2019 on the Welsh Government website \[5.11\]. Ying Zhou’s work was cited, and her contribution acknowledged in the report. Since the publication of the report, the Welsh government has set up the Social Partnership and Fair Work Directorate and secured a Social Partnership Act in Wales through the parliament to take forward the recommendations of the Fair Work Commission \[5.12\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 When plastics degrade, they release toxic pollutants into soil and water, causing long\-lasting damage to the environment. To address this issue, it is vital that international policymakers have accurate data on how both traditional and new plastics degrade. A team of scientists at Queen Mary has developed new, accurate methods for determining rates of biodegradation of different plastics. They have also generated new evidence on how some plastics are naturally broken down by bacteria. This research has i\) informed public policy debate on the biodegradation of plastics in the UK and Europe and ii\) underpinned the development of new UK guidelines on the analysis of plastics in the environment. The research has informed European Commission debate on the introduction of new regulations governing new biodegradable plastics, and has been used by not\-for\-profit and governmental organisations, including the Oxo\-biodegradable Plastic Association \(OPA\) and the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs \(Defra\) to develop policy. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 There is overwhelming evidence that plastic materials are accumulating in large quantities on land, and in oceans, seas, rivers and lakes across the world, damaging some of our most important natural environments. Traditional plastics, such as low\-density polyethylene, commonly used in plastic bags, are non\-degradable. This has led to a rapid search for viable alternatives. Biodegradable polymers, such as plant\-based hydrodegradable, compostable plastics and oxo\-biodegradable plastic, which contains a catalyst to aid degradation when exposed to oxygen, are among the new materials developed. Industries are being urged by governments, regulators and consumers to adopt these new materials and their use is increasing exponentially, with 2,110,000 tonnes manufactured in 2018 alone. 

 When developing legislation and guidelines on the use of these new plastics, regulators need to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of different materials and evaluate their biodegradability and the environmental impact of any derived micro\-sized particles. By 2050, it is estimated that 12,000,000,000 tonnes of microplastic from the degradation of waste plastic will have entered the environment. Until recently, this evaluation has been challenging due to a lack of high\-quality analytical methods and poorly reproducible measurements of biodegradability. A multidisciplinary team of polymer chemists, biochemists, microbiologists and environmental biologists at Queen Mary has worked to address this problem, developing reproducible measurements of biodegradability of different plastics and a standardised approach to analysing their impact on the environment. 

 The team’s research started in 2011 in the Department of Chemistry, when Prof. Resmini developed an interest in degradable plastic, which resulted in an EPSRC grant \[EQR.1\] to explore the concept of ‘self\-immolative’ polymers, where the main backbone chain of the plastic was expected to breakdown, following the activation by an enzymatic trigger. This led to an interest in studying micro\- and nano\-particles and their behaviour at the air\-water interface \[3.1\], which in turn led to a new collaboration with Dr. Rose, a biochemist based in the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences. The team initiated a programme of research that focused on biodegradable plastics and environmental pollution. 

 In a significant innovation, the researchers developed a new, accurate and highly reproducible method for evaluating the biodegradability of different plastics in water \[3.2\], which was achieved by monitoring bacterial respiration in an aqueous media supplemented with plastic samples. The scientists use gas\-chromatography to measure levels of CO<sub>2</sub> evolved from a fully defined liquid media containing a single microbial culture and a single carbon source, the plastic polymer. The assay is reliable, is not dependent on the source of the micro\-organisms, and does not require the use of soil samples. Most importantly, it enables precise and reproducible comparison of the biodegradability of different types of plastic. 

 Building on this advance, Resmini developed a new collaborative project with Dr. Jones, an environmental scientist in the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences with significant experience in pollution pressures in aquatic systems. Jones is an expert in the analysis of long\-term, large\-scale data to determine trends in the environmental impacts of stressors from agriculture, industry and invasive species \[3.3\]. The aim of their collaboration was to generate new and improved understanding of the impact degraded microplastics have on the environment. 

 In 2018, Defra commissioned Jones \[EQR.2\] to carry out an analysis of existing research evidence on the sampling and measurement of microplastic pollution in water. Simultaneous to this Defra commission, Resmini and Jones carried out a systematic analysis of reliable global data detailing the relative abundance of polymers in freshwaters and estuaries. The results \[3.4\] show that microplastics comprised of polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane are significantly less abundant than might be expected, given their levels of global production. This has implications for models of microplastic environmental pollution that are based on production levels and on the environmental fate of chemicals. When analysed by matrix \(water, sediment or biota\) distinct profiles were obtained for each category. The data suggest that the environmental distribution of microplastic particles, influenced by physical, chemical and biological processes, plays an important role in their environmental impact. However, attempts to explain the concentrations of different plastics found in matrices on the basis of their densities have not been successful, suggesting that the problem is far more complex. For example, the research team found that certain types of microplastics are found in much higher quantities in plant or animal life \(biota\) compared to water or sediment. This raises an important question about why biota absorb some microplastics but not others, highlighting the need for more and better\-informed laboratory exposure studies. 

 The study of microplastics is relatively new, and the team at Queen Mary is leading the way in developing a standardised approach to analysing its environmental impact. This, combined with the new ability to compare a wide variety of plastic samples, including standard low\-density polyethylene, oxo\-plastic and bioplastic under identical experimental conditions has enabled the direct comparison of the relative biodegradability of various polymers. As such, the team has provided reliable and reproducible data that have been used by regulators, policymakers and industry groups to formulate positions on the use of plastics and policies on plastic degradation.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Opinion is greatly divided over the environmental impact and the biodegradability of traditional plastics versus new biodegradable plastics, in particular oxo\-biodegradable plastics. This is due to inconsistency in methods used to sample, measure and analyse biodegradation. Both Defra, in the UK, and the European Commission, have driven the public debate on this topic, with the aim to establish clear policies and guidelines, benefitting both producers of the materials and the wider public. These regulators require reliable and consistent scientific data. The team at Queen Mary has informed and advanced the debate by: i\) developing a new, reproducible method for evaluating the biodegradability of different plastics under identical conditions, and providing new data on the fate of oxo\-biodegradable plastic in the environment; ii\) demonstrating the urgent need for standardising approaches in monitoring microplastics and their environmental impact. 

#  Informing regulators on the fate of oxo\-biodegradable plastic in the environment 

 In 2016 the European Commission \(EC\) commissioned the environmental consultancy Eunomia Research & Consulting to carry out a project to evaluate the impact of the use of oxo-degradable plastic on the environment. A number of scientists were invited to present their work, including the Queen Mary team. Rose presented the team’s key results, which had yet to be published. The final report presented to the EC by Eunomia \[5.1\] was designed to inform the European policy on oxo\-biodegradable plastic. The report described the strength of Queen Mary’s evidence, stating: “The findings are significant and the test method unique” \(p. 45\) \[5.1\]. As a result the EC in 2017 delayed a decision to ban oxo\-degradable plastics. 

 The public debate on the impact of oxo\-degradable plastic in the environment continued, led by the EC’s Directorate\-General for Environment, responsible for the EU’s environmental policy, and the Oxo\-biodegradable Plastic Association \(OPA\), a not\-for profit organisation that represents over 1,600 companies worldwide involved in the use of oxo\-biodegradable plastic. 

 The main issue was the concern that biodegradation technology could lead to the formation of large quantities of microplastic in the environment. This was raised as a query by the EC to the European Chemicals Agency \(ECHA\) in December 2017. The EC stated: “The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that damage to marine environments is at least USD 8 billion per year globally.” In their response, the OPA published a report *Rethinking the Future of Plastics* \[5.2\], which addressed the issues raised by the ECHA \(January 2018\). Citing Queen Mary’s research evidence extensively, the OPA argued that the degradation process is not a fragmentation of the polymer, but instead an entire change of the material into molecules that can be bio\-assimilated. “This point is absolutely crucial to an understanding of oxo\-biodegradable plastic technology,” they said in a supporting report to *Future of Plastics* \[5.3\]. The OPA described the Queen Mary team’s observational studies in seawater in France: “Oxo\-bioplastic has been degraded in real time in seawater \[in\] Bandol in France, and the scientists at Queen Mary observed the resulting material being used as a food\-source by bacteria commonly found on land and in the oceans…in their view there is no reason why this process should stop in the natural environment until all the material has been consumed” \[5.3\]. 

 The research evidence produced by Queen Mary has been used to address the debate on the key difference between oxo\-degradable and oxo\-biodegradable plastics, the latter designed to convert at the end of their useful life into biodegradable materials and to biodegrade under any conditions in the open environment within a much shorter timescale. In December 2020, Symphony Environmental Plc – a company that develops additives to make ordinary plastic biodegradable, which operates in more than 90 countries – presented a legal challenge to the EU on the basis that it is failing to differentiate between oxo\-degradable and oxo\-biodegradable plastic \[5.4\], citing Queen Mary’s research. 

 The policy discussions around the biodegradability of novel types of plastics continues, as more scientific evidence is gathered to support new policy and guidelines. Mr. Michal Laurier, Chief Executive Officer of Symphony Environmental, has testified to the contribution the Queen Mary team has made to the policy debate on oxo\-biodegradable plastic, stating: “Experiments conducted by Dr Rose and her colleagues…have shown that oxo\-biodegradable plastics do indeed become biodegradable if discarded in the open environment, and are consumed by bacteria commonly found on land and by bacteria commonly found in the oceans…The University has therefore made an important contribution to the advancement of science in this area, and to the protection of the environment worldwide” \[5.5\]. In 2018, an independent review of the evidence on oxo\-biodegradable technology by Peter Susman QC, cited Queen Mary’s research \[5.6\] \(p. 9\). The contribution of Queen Mary to the public debate has been further recognised by the Chairman of the OPA in 2020 \[5.7\]. 

#  Informing new policy on the sampling and analysis of plastics in the environment 

 In 2018, Jones was commissioned by Defra to provide evidence to inform new guidelines and standards on the sampling and analysis of microplastics in fresh water. In the spring of 2020 the research evidence was published and presented by Defra \( [view the report](http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&ProjectID=20192&FromSearch=Y&Publisher=1&SearchText=WT15112&SortString=ProjectCode&SortOrder=Asc&Paging=10)\). A Scientific and Policy Advisor at Defra commented on the report \[5.8\], saying: “it will prove to be a valuable reference document when reviewing and evaluating new and reported ‘microplastic’ studies/research irrespective of whether they have been performed in fresh, estuarine or offshore waters.” In relation to how Defra will use the research evidence contained in the report, the Scientific and Policy Advisor said: “We see this review being a key document and playing an important part in the early development of standardising methodologies from sampling, sample preparation, analysis, characterisation, to reporting” \[5.8\]. 

 Developing this work, Resmini and Jones undertook more analysis on the environmental impact of microplastics, which resulted in new evidence of the lack of standardisation in sampling and measurements. The researchers also identified important gaps in the understanding of the sources and fate of microplastics in the environment. The findings were shared with Defra, who then invited the Queen Mary team to present them in a meeting of the UK Academics\-Regulators Nanomaterial Risk Assessment Group \(11/11/2020\) \[5.9\] to ensure wider dissemination of the data to important stakeholders. This Group is a European Commission  [consortium](https://www.h2020gracious.eu/event/uk_academics_regulators_nanomaterial_risk_assessment_group) bringing together 25 influential partners across Europe to discuss the latest research and regulatory priorities in this policy field. Members include large multinationals, such as Unilever, BASF and AkzoNobel and national regulatory agencies, such as the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in The Netherlands, and the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Italy. 

 When describing the impact of Queen Mary’s research on policy development at Defra \[5.10\], Dr. Steve Morris, Senior Scientific Advisor at Defra, says that it has had a “distinct and material contribution” to Defra’s position on “future policy on the environmental impact of microplastics” in freshwater and estuarine environments. Dr. Morris states that the researchers have identified “gaps in our current understanding of the sources and fate of microplastics…\[and\] new and key factors influencing the environmental effects of microplastics and the interpretation of data from real\-world monitoring and experimental studies.” Dr. Morris concludes: “The environmental impact of microplastics is an important priority for Defra and the findings by Jones and Resmini have highlighted key issues that are being considered as we develop policy” \[5.10\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The University of Cambridge Primary School \(UCPS\) is the sole primary education University Training School in the UK. Evidence, principles and recommendations from significant research into primary education at the University of Cambridge underpin the UCPS research\-informed model for primary school education. Despite being recently established, the UCPS model has already been mobilised beyond the school, as a tool for achieving wider impact on policy, research and practice regionally, nationally and internationally. Significant impact arising beyond the impact on the school itself includes: 

-  Directly informing approaches to school design and learning spaces in the UK 

-  Directly leading approaches to system change via collaborations for school improvement 

-  Directly influencing educational curriculum policy 

-  Directly influencing the school sector’s understanding and enactment of research\-informed professional knowledge, innovative pedagogies and practice 

-  Directly influencing teachers’ professional learning and development 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 A robust lineage of academic research from Cambridge’s Faculty of Education, begun in the 1990s but intensifying after 2000, led to publications in the period 2004\-2016, which underpinned the creation of the UCPS’s research\-informed model for primary school education and its subsequent impact within and beyond the school \(Fig 1\). 

 The Cambridge Primary Review \(CPR \- REF 2014\), led by Alexander, remains the most comprehensive, independent enquiry into English primary school education \[R1\]. This 3\-year review initiated a national discourse with which to articulate research\-informed primary school education. Integral to the UCPS model are the report’s recommendations that schools should: i\) foster individual qualities such as engagement and autonomy; ii\) enable critically important orientations to people and the wider world, such as respect and global citizenship and iii\) focus on the content, processes and outcomes of learning itself, by fostering skills and exciting the imagination \[R1 p.179\-9\]. 

 The “Learning without Limits” project \[R2\], led by Hart, influenced the development of the school. This study interrogated traditional conceptualisations of ability. It posited that primary education must be informed by the concept of transformability, such that *all* children can become powerful, committed, successful learners. 

 Research led by Rudduck and Flutter as part of the Teaching and Learning Research Programme called for an overhaul of school organisation, relationships and practice \[R3\]. It stressed the importance of engaging young learners; empowering them to think critically about citizenship and democracy and express reasoned decisions for school improvement. 

 Pedagogically, the UCPS model incorporates the benefits of dialogic approaches. The Faculty is a world\-leading centre for research on the role of classroom dialogue: the way that teachers and students talk productively to maximise student learning. An ESRC\-funded 3\-year study \[R4\] led by Howe and Mercer identifies learning\-focused dialogue as the fundamental educational tool in primary education. Subsequently, the Cambridge Educational Dialogue Research \(CEDiR\) group has developed a range of research\-informed and evaluated practical resources. This research demonstrated how reasoned dialogue \(“exploratory talk”\) is facilitated by teachers, with students using specific ‘talk moves’ to elicit, build on, evaluate and respectfully challenge others’ ideas, supported by class\-negotiated ‘ground rules’ and ‘talking points’. The Scheme for Educational Dialogue Analysis \(SEDA\), an analytic tool used by researchers globally to measure the quality of dialogue, illustrates that specific talk moves are productive for student learning \[R5, R6\]. This toolkit enables practitioners to *systematically* micro\-analyse classroom interaction and the effectiveness and limitations of their own/peers’ practices. UCPS’s curriculum design promotes dialogic education, knowing that teacher\-pupil and pupil\-pupil talk is underexplored as tools for learning and understanding. 

 Research led by Whitebread \[R7\] established that play promotes increased learning engagement; facilitates social interaction linked to improved learning outcomes; enables children to make meaningful links to their own knowledge and experience, and stimulates creative ways of thinking. Of key importance to the UCPS model is Whitebread’s conclusion that the playful pedagogies used with younger children are equally effective throughout the primary age range. This finding contrasts with current trends, which endorse teacher\-directed approaches for older children. 

 A body of research led by Burke \[R8\] explored the relationship between innovation in teaching and the design of formal and informal learning environments; the view of the child and young person in the design of education; and the history of 20<sup>th</sup> century school architecture and its pioneers. Her insights underpinned the design of the UCPS building and outdoor landscape.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Impact within the school** 

 The research has impacted on UCPS students as evidenced by judgements on the quality of education provided by Ofsted. Outcomes for all children are deemed to be *‘consistently above those of other pupils nationally’*, according to the 2018 Ofsted report \[E1\]. The UCPS is rated ‘Outstanding’ and Ofsted describes the curriculum as ‘ *exceptionally broad and balanced … bold, ambitious and knowledge\-rich,* which empowers *‘all children to learn, to question, to discuss and to challenge ideas across a broad range of subjects.’* Ofsted inspectors witnessed ‘ *high\-quality, innovative, research\-based teaching’* and recognised its contribution to a *‘trajectory of improving outcomes.’* 

 The school has mobilised the UCPS research\-informed model to have impact beyond its own community. Ofsted confirms how *‘collaborative working in school, with the university and an increasing number of other schools, locally, nationally and internationally’* has generated *‘a flourishing learning community’* \[E1\]. 

 **Regional impact** 

 Achieving whole school change is complex but the UCPS model has already influenced other primary schools in the region, in terms of research\-informed professional knowledge, innovative pedagogies and practice. The Chartered College of Teaching \(CCT\) awarded UCPS the status of ‘CCT regional learning hub’ – a site to facilitate professional development of teachers. The Chief Executive of CCT explains: ‘ *We are incredibly encouraged that an exemplary organisation like the UCPS, with its links to research within the university and beyond, takes on the role as a hub for the region **’ \[E2\]. 

 500 educators have benefitted from participation in UCPS professional learning events, with a 100% satisfaction rate \[E3\]. Faculty researchers have provided training in dialogic approaches, creative pedagogies and other aspects of the UCPS model \[E3\]. Feedback shows participants have adopted new practices, increased pedagogical knowledge and developed professional collaborations. 

 The UCPS has an enabling physical environment which has influenced the design of learning spaces locally. The Chair of Governors of Cavendish School, a ‘free’ school for pupils with autism, due to open in 2021 reports: *‘We have paid close attention to the way \[UCPS\] learning spaces encourage independence and choice … \[subsequently\] we have taken opportunities to create larger flexible spaces, introduce curves to soften the design and improve flow … and connect with the outside space.’* \[E4\]. 

 **National impact** 

 In 2019, the Avanti Schools Trust commissioned the UCPS to lead a strategic review of provision for three ‘failing’ primary schools. The UCPS identified key principles to underpin the development of a new curriculum; created a programme of professional development for staff; devised an assessment policy and a strategic plan to focus on high quality practice. The Avanti Board adopted these recommendations for September 2020 which *‘impacts on three school communities … 986 children … 120 teachers and learning assistants.’* Moreover, the Avanti Trust is to ‘ *implement the curriculum review in **all** its existing primary schools … impacting upon the education of approximately 2,200 children and over 220 teachers’* \[E5\]. 

 Dialogic practices are central to the UCPS model and, through the efforts of the school and Faculty, there has been national impact in terms of increasing the use of dialogic approaches in primary education. Mercer was involved in drafting the National Curriculum 2014, and his words were taken up in the Spoken language – Years 1 to 6 section \[E6\]. Schools are now expected to demonstrate understanding and practice of dialogic approaches. Hennessy and colleagues developed a freely downloadable professional learning toolkit \(T\-SEDA\) plus online multimedia resources \[E6\] with more than 5,000 unique page views since 2018. This impact activity was supported through an ESRC IAA grant. One illustrative case is the London South Teaching Schools Alliance \(LSTSA\) which continues to use T\-SEDA 2 years on \[E7\] and where teachers noted that they were now *‘more aware of how children are \(or are not\) listening to each other’* and the impact that discussion can have ‘ *upon children's progress, confidence and resilience to learning within the classroom.’* 

 Marks Barfield Architects \(MBA\), who designed the UCPS building, ‘ *resolved to allow the education ethos, aims and principles to lead the design process and endeavoured to be free of preconceptions and open to possibility*’ \[E8\]. MBA won The Royal institute of British Architects \(RIBA\) East award 2017 for the unique design and its influence on other school designers. 

 **International impact** 

 In 2020 James Biddulph, headteacher, presented the UCPS model to 2,000 delegates at the ‘Global Education’ international conference in India, attended by educators, academics and policymakers such as the Minister of Education in Karnataka, India. As a result, a contextualised version of the UCPS model *‘3H formula – brilliant heads, compassionate hearts and competent hands’* is being integrated into systems of schools worldwide \[E9\]. The school has a contract for seven edited books from Routledge, to demonstrate how the research underpinning the UCPS model can be applied in schools. The UCPS also shares its model, professional knowledge and practice via social media, with over 3,000 followers on Twitter. 

 The Faculty and UCPS dialogic resources have had strong international uptake \(at least 360 educators are using it in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan and Spain\). Schools in Israel and New Zealand have used T\-SEDA for 3\+ years. For example, in Israel 30 trainee and 25 qualified teachers participated in a 30\-hour facilitator training programme before cascading to at least 100 more teachers in their schools. CEDiR researchers undertook follow\-up interviews 18/36 months after adoption, showing continuing development of practice \[E10\]. In China, T\-SEDA has been translated and used, including by 45 teachers at The Eos Research Global centre in Beijing. A 6\-month trial across Guandong province \(188 schools\) is planned. China’s largest education provider Dipont Education committed £730,000 over 10 years to a global platform to support its use, under the new Digital Education Futures Initiative. 

 UCPS has participated in a 3\-year Erasmus ‘Lab School’ project led by Bielefeld University, Germany. The project aims to promote professional knowledge exchange among participants and with non\-European partners. This has impacted on the professional practice of over 25 international visitors to the school. One teacher reflected on the UCPS teachers’ practices that sought to develop and maintain the ethos of the school, for example, effectively building positive relationships with children: *‘I now deliberately sit together with the children at lunch and listen to their conversation.’* Another teacher was inspired by *‘the visualisation of different types of mathematical operations’* \[E11\]. The Principal of Druk Padma Karpo School, Ladakh, India, participated in a ‘ *transformational leadership programme’* at the UCPS, which enabled her to *‘reflect \[on\] my own leadership capabilities’* \[E12\] and introduce *‘good practices and innovative methodologies’* at her own institution.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The LifeGuide platform, developed at the University of Southampton, is a unique set of open\-source internet\-based software tools that allow researchers to flexibly create, modify and evaluate internet\-based behavioural change interventions. Such interventions cost\-effectively provide 24/7 personalised support for health management. Since August 2013, the impact of the LifeGuide research programme has been at three levels: 

 1\) The programme has enabled a large international community of behavioural researchers to flexibly and efficiently create, modify and evaluate digital health interventions in ground\-breaking large\-scale clinical trials, not previously possible without LifeGuide software. 

 2\) Dissemination of effective, evidence\-based interventions to over 200,000 patients and members of the public through NHS, public, and private sector partnerships has supported timely and sustained self\-management of health, including to prevent the spread of COVID\-19. This demonstrates positive engagement with outputs enabled by the programme. 

 3\) NHS care pathways have changed to improve patient management and efficiently provide more effective care.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Lucy Yardley initiated and led the development of a unique set of internet\-based software tools known as LifeGuide that allow researchers to flexibly create, modify and evaluate digital behaviour change interventions to support sustained self\-management of health. The interactive technology means that the particular situation, concerns and preferences of each individual are used as the basis for an intensive support programme that can deliver members of the public and healthcare professionals with personalised guidance and feedback, help with planning, automated reminders by text and email, and opportunities for communication. The development of LifeGuide interventions has been shaped by systematic analysis of the needs of users, using a process of developing and optimising digital interventions that is now known and disseminated as the LifeGuide team’s distinctive and highly successful ‘Person\-Based Approach’ to intervention development. 

 As Principal Investigator, Yardley obtained initial funding for the LifeGuide research programme from the ESRC in 2008\-2011 \[ **G1**\] and further funding from the EPSRC in 2011\-2015 \[ **G2**\]. Yardley led the co\-design of the software, working closely with Dr Mark Weal \(Associate Professor, Web and Internet Science, UOA 11\), Dr Leanne Morrison, Dr Judith Joseph and Dr Laura Dennison. From 2013 to 2020, in collaboration with numerous colleagues, most notably Professor Paul Little \(Professor of Primary Care Research, UOA 2\), Yardley secured funding totalling more than GBP50million from providers including the NIHR, MRC, DoH, EU and medical charities to use the LifeGuide software tools to efficiently develop and evaluate digital interventions for a wide range of health problems. As part of the 2014\-2019 DIPSS project \[ **G3**\], additional support was developed to facilitate more complex clinician patient communication within the LifeGuide platform. The research programme extended the functionality of the platform, facilitated new types of intervention development, and improved the effectiveness of the delivery, trialling, deployment and analysis of interventions. 

 The development process and funding were used to build up a body of knowledge and expertise about how best to develop effective digital behaviour change interventions, drawing on in\-depth analyses of how users engaged with the interventions. The LifeGuide team was able to demonstrate the capabilities and achievements of their approach through a series of major clinical trials, leading to multiple publications in the top medical journals such as the Lancet \[ **3.1**\- **3.6**\]. Their expertise has been shared widely with the research community to enable other research teams to also create effective digital interventions. 

 LifeGuide interventions include preventive interventions for the general public, tackling high priority public health problems such as smoking \[ **3.6**\] and dementia \(the trial of an intervention to support physical activity and brain training is ongoing\). For example, the LifeGuide team developed the first online intervention worldwide to promote hygienic behaviour to reduce transmission of respiratory infection \(currently being used to reduce the spread of COVID\-19\) and reduce the need for antibiotics \[ **3.1**\]. There are also LifeGuide interventions to help patients and health professionals manage numerous common and serious health problems better, including interventions for hypertension, cancer \[ **3.4**\], asthma, dizziness \[ **3.5**\], back pain, and diabetes. In addition, the LifeGuide software has been used with international collaborators to create and modify interventions for use in different countries, from Poland to Taiwan \[ **3.2**, **3.3**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The LifeGuide software tools allow researchers to iteratively create, modify and reuse digital interventions in a way that was not previously possible. This process of iterative development improves efficiency, by avoiding the costly duplication of effort and resources when developing new digital interventions, and reduces costs by avoiding the need to buy in expensive web programming support. At the University of Southampton, development of the LifeGuide software tools has enabled the creation and modification of digital interventions for a wide range of illness management and public health applications in the UK and internationally. 

 Enabling the efficient creation of interventions with the LifeGuide software, coupled with applying a successful method for developing interventions using the ‘Person\-Based Approach’ pioneered by the LifeGuide team and endorsed by Public Health England in 2018 \[ **5.1**\], attracted substantial funding. This funding has supported the subsequent dissemination of effective digital health interventions by the LifeGuide team to well over 100,000 patients, health professionals and members of the public. 

 Additionally, the LifeGuide software tools and Person\-Based Approach have been disseminated widely, free and open\-source, to a range of users in the public sector \(e.g. NHS, PHE\), third sector \(e.g. Cancer Research UK\) and private sector \(e.g. Cigna Insurance\) \[ **5.2**\]. The ‘LifeGuide Community’ website \[ **5.3**\] which provides support for disseminating LifeGuide software use has over 3000 members who have used the software to develop interventions. This demonstrates that access to the software has not just benefitted researchers at the University of Southampton, but members of the research community across the UK and internationally \(in over 20 countries\). For example, the charity Macmillan worked with the University of Southampton, using LifeGuide to develop and trial the ‘Restore’ intervention to help cancer patients with their fatigue symptoms. The trial\(published December 2015\) \[ **3.4**\] demonstrated that Restore helped patients feel more confident to cope with their fatigue and so Macmillan now make this intervention directly available to patients via the Macmillan website \[ **5.4**\]. A second example is the work carried out with the University of Ulster to develop an intervention to help maximise sexual wellbeing for people living with prostate cancer, in partnership with the charity Prostate Cancer UK. The trial demonstrated that the intervention helped to improve self\-perceived knowledge and understanding of managing sexual issues and the resource has been made publicly available, including on the Prostate Cancer UK website \[ **5.11**\]. The Ulster team’s testimonial describes the significant impact of this project: “These established programmes, that we built through the LifeGuide platform, are essential elements of the Prostate Cancer UK/Movember TrueNTH efforts to meet the needs of this population. The potential reach of the programmes is substantial, and using the local, national and international links we’ve established, the resources will have a profound impact on the experience of the growing cohort of men/partners who are coping with the long term side\-effects of prostate cancer treatments.” \[ **5.11**\]. 

 Further examples of the concrete impact from LifeGuide interventions developed at the University of Southampton are described below. 

 **LifeGuide interventions to combat infection and the rise of antimicrobial resistance** 

 Yardley and the LifeGuide team have developed a series of interventions that have effectively reduced antibiotic use. These interventions will prevent the continued growth in antimicrobial resistant infection identified by the UK Parliament Health and Social Care Committee as a Top Five Policy Priority. 

 Yardley, Little, Miller and Joseph developed an MRC\-funded LifeGuide intervention to promote handwashing to reduce the spread of respiratory infection in the home \(particularly seasonal and pandemic flu\) which was trialled in 20,000 UK adults. There was a 15% reduction in episodes of infection, including reduced frequency and severity of illness, and reduced consultations and antibiotic prescriptions \(Lancet, 2015\) \[ **3.1**\]. This was the first digital intervention worldwide to effectively reduce infection transmission in the home. Preventing the spread of infection is an important method of reducing the need for antibiotics as well as reducing illness and healthcare demand; respiratory infections lead more than a quarter of the population to visit their GP each year and are the source of 60% of all antibiotic prescribing. 

 The resulting ‘Germ Defence’ website was endorsed and made available by NICE as a recommended resource to support antimicrobial stewardship in the general population \[ **5.5**\]. In March 2020 Yardley obtained funding from UKRI to update Germ Defence for the prevention of COVID\-19 \(by including all methods of reducing infection in the home\) and disseminate nationally and internationally. Germ Defence was rapidly translated into over 20 languages and disseminated to over 100,000 users worldwide \[ **5.6**\]. A clinical trial disseminating Germ Defence to all primary care patients was selected for national prioritisation as an NIHR Urgent Public Health COVID\-19 Study to help prevent a second wave of infections in autumn 2020. 

 Digital interventions for healthcare professionals also have the potential to reduce antibiotic usage. Yardley, Little, Douglas and Tonkin\-Crine worked on the EC\-funded development of a LifeGuide intervention to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing across Europe. Online training provided GPs with motivation, skills training and resources to engage patients with lower respiratory tract infection in self\-management without antibiotics, when appropriate. The intervention reduced prescribing rates by 20% in 246 GP practices \(4,360 patients\) in the UK, Spain, Poland, Belgium and the Netherlands \(Lancet, 2014\) \[ **3.2**\]. Working with the LifeGuide team, the digital intervention has been provided as a national education resource to Belgium and the team have described the value of our collaboration in their testimonial: “Our collaboration enabled us to rapidly develop, trial and disseminate multiple versions of our intervention in different languages and we could not have carried out this work without Professor Yardley’s team and LifeGuide \[ **5.12**\]. The resource has also been adapted and trialled successfully for use in Australia \(by Dr Magin Parker, trial published in Family Practice, 2017\), and for children with respiratory tract infection in the Netherlands \(by Dr Anne Dekker, trial published in Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, 2018\). More recently, Yardley has led the development of a LifeGuide intervention to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in hospitals \(in collaboration with University of Oxford\). A feasibility trial suggested that this intervention could substantially increase rates of stopping antibiotic use when no longer needed. The intervention is now being trialled in 36 hospitals and has already been adopted and rolled out nationally by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **LifeGuide interventions to support patient and public self\-management of health** 

 Yardley co\-led the development of a self\-guided DVD/booklet intervention that used breathing exercises to improve outcomes for patients with asthma. The intervention improved quality of life in a trial of 655 patients in 34 GP practices \[ **5.8**\]. This evidence was identified as high quality \(grade 1\+\+\) in the updated national guidance for asthma management produced by the British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network \[ **5.9** section 6.2.14, p 60\], which on the basis of this trial alone concluded for the first time that this was a useful treatment to offer patients. On publication of the trial in 2018, LifeGuide was used to offer digital access to the intervention for health professionals and patients; it has had over 10,000 users. The LifeGuide team is currently working with Asthma UK to make a version available adapted for young people. 

 Yardley, Geraghty, Essery and Kirby developed a LifeGuide intervention to support people with dizziness due to vestibular \(inner ear\) problems to carry out balance retraining exercises which help symptoms improve \[ **5.10**\]. A study of 296 patients in 54 GP practices showed that the intervention was effective, and it was made available to clinicians worldwide via a link in the paper abstract \[ **3.5**\]. Following active dissemination through the national and local media, and other routes \(e.g. National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for leadership in Applied Health Research and Care, NIHR CLAHRC; invited talk to the Inaugural International Conference of Vestibular Rehabilitation, Chicago, August 2018\), and between going live in February 2017 to December 2020, the intervention had 6,295 registered users. A successful trial of a LifeGuide\-based Dutch version of the website in 322 patients was published in the British Medical Journal \(van Vugt, 2019\) \[ **5.13**\]. The testimonial from the team in the Netherlands describes the importance of this research and our partnership: “This could potentially decrease dizziness symptoms for thousands of patients with chronic dizziness in the Netherlands, which would never have been possible without the LifeGuide team.” \[ **5.13**\] The LifeGuide team are working with them to disseminate the intervention to patients in Dutch and the original English version.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Astronomy and astronomy instrumentation research at Cardiff provided new insights into the formation and evolution of stars, galaxies and the Universe. The research underpinned development of educational and public outreach resources; these enabled European\-wide astronomy activities and inspired new interactive visualisations of astronomical observations with global reach, including the first 3D astrophysical exhibit in the Smithsonian. The Cardiff team also trained over 800 teachers, reaching over 10,000 school\-age students and addressing gender perceptions around science. This innovative training programme led to changes in the Welsh Joint Education Committee \(WJEC\) AS and A\-Level Physics curriculum. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Researchers at Cardiff University have held leadership positions in instrumentation development and scientific exploitation of several major astronomical observatories. The Astronomy Instrumentation Group \(AIG\) made major contributions to space instrumentation programmes, including the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver \(SPIRE\) on board ESA’s *Herschel* space observatory \(Griffin PI\) **\[3.1\]** and the High Frequency Instrument \(HFI\) on board ESA’s *Planck* satellite \(Ade Co\-I\) **\[3.2\]**. They were also key partners in many ground\-based and balloon\-borne telescopes, including the Balloon\-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope, BLAST \(Hargrave Co\-I\) **\[3.3\]** and the SCUBA\-2 camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope \(Ade Co\-I\) **\[3.4\]**. 

 These observatories and instruments have enabled an unprecedented view of the Universe, allowing researchers to peer into dust clouds to see stars forming and dying, trace cosmic dust back to the early Universe, and study the physics of the Big Bang. Cardiff astronomers, for example, led large collaborative projects, focusing on star formation and evolution, star death, space dust, galaxy formation and evolution, and investigations of the very early Universe. These projects resulted in over 200 peer\-reviewed publications and include the *Herschel*\-ATLAS survey \(PI Eales\), which produced unprecedented measurements of the dust and gas content of galaxies over cosmic history **\[3.5\]**. 

 Work by Gomez and Matsuura resolved the controversy about the origin of cosmic dust, one of the building blocks for life **\[3.6\]**, showing that supernovae are an important source of cosmic dust. Building on previous work, Gomez also analysed supernovae and stellar evolution from an infrared \(dusty\) viewpoint, which enabled the first 3D image of a supernova remnant **\[3.7\]**. 

 Cardiff’s combined experience in developing astronomical instruments and exploiting the data from them underpinned the development of a range of educational and outreach tools that drew directly upon the research, including: 

-  **Chromoscope**: a panoramic display of the sky as observed at different wavelengths, including data and results from *Herschel and Planck* **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]** 

-  **Star in a box**: interactive Hertzsprung\-Russell diagram demonstrating the lifecycle of stars, developed by Cardiff and the Las Cumbres Observatory in Chile, and informed by work on supernovae and stellar evolution from an infrared viewpoint **\[3.6, 3.7\]** 

-  **Messier Bingo:** interactive game based on Messier objects **\[3.5\]**, created through a collaborative programme of research with Las Cumbres Observatory **\[3.6\]** 

 Cardiff research contributions have been recognised by The Royal Astronomical Society through several awards, including the 2014 Group Achievement Award for the *Herschel*\-SPIRE instrument \(Griffin, Ade, Hargrave\), and individual medals and awards for work on *Herschel* \(Griffin, Eales, Gomez, and Ade\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cardiff’s astronomy and instrumentation research achieved global news coverage and underpinned internationally used educational resources. Coupled with teacher training and interactive sessions, the Cardiff team promoted astronomy research across four key areas: 

-  Designed school resources and teacher training that challenged gender norms, and hosted European\-wide school activities **\(4.1\)** 

-  Changed the WJEC AS & A\-Level Physics curriculum and supported teachers with tools to teach multiwavelength astronomy at AS and A\-Level **\(4.2\)** 

-  Developed new astronomy visualisation and outreach tools leading to new international public engagement **\(4.3\)** 

-  Conducted public outreach activities including workshops, talks, and media events promoting astrophysics, recognized by the award of an MBE for excellence in public engagement **\(4.4\)** 

  1.  **Designed school resources and teacher training** 

 **a. Supporting teachers and female role models in primary schools** 

 In 2012, Wales scored lower than all other UK nations for Science \(based on the Programme for International Student Assessment \(PISA\) evaluation\). The country also had fewer than half the number of female physics academics compared to the UK average. To address this, the team developed the *Universe in the Classroom* \(UitC\) project, led by Gomez **\[5.1\]**, which was funded by the Welsh Government. The project targeted schools less likely to engage with science education, specifically those in rural areas, with more students in poverty, and lower educational attainment. 

 In 2014 and 2015, the UitC project trained 131 teachers across 99 Welsh primary schools. The training focused on theory and resources from Cardiff research, including the *Star in a box*, and interpretation of multiwavelength data demonstrated through the *Herschel* Space Observatory. A post\-project survey of teachers indicated an increase in their confidence and ability to train pupils in physics and other sciences: 97% of teachers felt more confident when teaching science, and 94% used the Cardiff resources in their teaching delivery within six weeks of receiving them **\[5.1\]**. 

 The UitC project also trained 34 undergraduate and postgraduate students to be Stellar Role Models \(STARS\) using the same principles described above. The STARS delivered 21 workshops within disadvantaged and remote schools across Wales, engaging 871 primary students. A third of the STARS were female, an approach designed to challenge perceptions that scientists are more often male. After STARS workshops, students were asked to draw a ‘typical’ scientist. While children in general are more likely to draw a ‘typical’ scientist as male, after workshops hosted by female STARS both male and female students were more likely to draw a female scientist. Demonstrating the vital impact of positive role models, pupils with male teachers were 28% more likely to draw a female scientist after a female\-led STARS workshop **\[5.1\]**. 

 **b. Inspiring Science Education Project** 

 Cardiff was the UK lead organisation in the €5M million EU\-FP7 project Inspiring Science Education \(ISE\). Running between 2013 and 2016, the project was designed to bring astronomy research into schools to train and provide resources for teachers, working with 31 European partners. 

 In April and May 2016, Cardiff hosted the *2016 Observing Challenge;* this used the Las Cumbres Observatory network **\[5.2a\]** and involved more than 65 schools across Europe. Between March and June 2016, the team promoted *Messier Bingo*, an interactive game designed to locate and view objects captured by the Las Cumbres Observatory network. As part of the ISE platform, the *Messier Bingo* activity reached 21 schools across Europe with nearly 700 students taking part **\[5.2a\]**. 

 The ISE project highlighted Cardiff’s outreach tools as exemplary “showcase” resources and promoted these to more teachers across Europe, including *Star in a box*, *Agent Exoplanet*, and *Chromoscope* **\[5.2b\]**. The ISE project website had 64,179 unique visitors by the end of July 2016. Over 5,700 teachers across Europe registered on the ISE programme in 2015, with 4,697 students using the online portal and 23,998 students reached in total **\[5.2c\]**. The Cardiff team hosted ISE events across the UK; these directly trained 149 teachers, delivered talks to 736 teachers, and involved 20 events reaching 1,470 pupils **\[5.2d\]**. 

 **4.2 Changed the WJEC AS & A\-Level Physics curriculum** 

 In 2014 the exam board WJEC \(including their subsidiary exam board Eduqas used across Great Britain\) consulted Cardiff when revising their AS and A\-Level Physics curriculum. Encouraged by the availability of Cardiff educational resources for multiwavelength astronomy, in 2015 WJEC revised their AS and A\-Level curriculums to include this topic **\[5.3\]**. 

 The revised WJEC and Eduqas Teaching Specification \(which outlines all topics students are taught\) now states that “ *Learners should be able to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and understanding*” of multiwavelength methods **\[5.4a\]**. Between 2016 and 2019 there were 11,724 exam candidates across Great Britain who were taught multiwavelength astronomy within the new AS and A\-Level Physics curriculum **\[5.5\]**. 

 The new curriculum was supported by a Teacher’s Guide advising teachers to use Cardiff’s resources such as *Chromoscope* and *Star in a bo*x **\[5.4a\]**. WJEC Subject Officer for Physics, Helen Francis, used Cardiff astronomy resources to train teachers on the new curriculum and reported that “ *centres that are using the resource are very happy with its suitability*” and estimated that 50% of WJEC\-sitting schools used Cardiff’s educational resources **\[5.3\]**. Since 2014 Cardiff researchers have also trained over 1,600 teachers and PGCE students with these astronomy resources at over 30 events across the UK, including via partnerships at the Institute of Physics, National Space Centre, and Techniquest science discovery centre **\[5.4b\]**. 

  1.  **Inspired new astronomy visualisation and outreach tools** 

 **a. The **Chromoscope** platform** 

 In 2009 Cardiff developed the *Chromoscope* interactive tool to display the sky as observed at different wavelengths, including data from *Herschel*. Between 2015 and 2019 *Chromoscope* received over 616,000 visits, 93% of which came from outside the UK **\[5.6a\]**. The tool has now been translated into 16 languages, and inspired other groups across the world to build their own astronomy outreach tools using Cardiff’s framework. Examples include: 

-  **GLEAMoscope:** Launched in 2016, GLEAMoscope enabled visualisation of results from the GLEAM survey using low\-frequency radio sky imaging. Developed by Dr Natasha Hurley\-Walker of Curtin University, Australia, GLEAMoscope received global media coverage including the New York Times, Daily Mail, Business Insider, and featured on the BBC’s *Sky at Night* **\[5.6b\]**. Dr Hurley\-Walker reported that GLEAMoscope was used in “ *hundreds*” of outreach events across Australia and inspired the creation of independent Android and virtual reality \(VR\) apps and planetarium shows, highlighting that “ *Chromoscope has massively increased the impact of our research, and also helped us reach tens of thousands of people across the world*” **\[5.6b\]**. 

-  **Sloan Digital Sky Survey:** In January 2015, Johns Hopkins University used *Chromoscope* to show Sloan Digital Sky Survey images from Diffuse Interstellar Bands. Featured by the Daily Mail, Huffington Post, and Astronomy.com, the Sloan team confirmed the tool had over 10,000 visitors and is regularly used to teach astronomy at Johns Hopkins University **\[5.6c\]** 

-  **HOPS \(H<sub>2</sub>O Southern Galactic Plane Survey\): ** In 2017 the HOPS team at Macquarie University, Australia, launched a HOPS data viewing facility using *Chromoscope*. The HOPS team noted that “ *Chromoscope has excelled as a presentation and outreach tool*” and that they are building a new online tool inspired by *Chromoscope* to visualise the HOPS data **\[5.6d\]**. 

 **b. The Smithsonian’s first 3D exhibit in astronomy** 

 Gomez’s research role in the analysis of the Cassiopeia\-A supernova remnant **\[3.6\]** led to a collaboration with the Smithsonian Institute in the USA, who created an online and interactive 3D display of the supernova based on the research **\[5.7\]**. In November 2013 the Smithsonian launched their first 3D exhibit of items from across their entire catalogue, including the Cassiopeia\-A supernova. NASA’s Chandra X\-Ray Center highlighted the display as the first ever supernova remnant to be modelled in 3D, and the only astronomical object featured in the Smithsonian’s 3D exhibit **\[5.8\]**. 

 In November 2013 the Chandra X\-Ray Center also designed and released a model of Cassiopeia A that can be 3D printed. The Smithsonian Institute reports that this 3D model was used across America including in schools and libraries, in STEM outreach programmes for girls, and in exhibits for blind and visually impaired persons. It was also showcased to several US Senators, and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institute **\[5.7\]**. Furthermore, in 2018 the Chandra X\-Ray Center launched a virtual reality \(VR\) model of Cassiopeia\-A described as “ *the first of its kind*”. The Center is now developing further 3D visualisations of astronomical models **\[5.7\]**. 

 **4.4 Public outreach activities** 

 Since 2014 Cardiff’s astronomy researchers have appeared on national media, including *BBC News*, *BBC Radio*, *ITV News*, *The Telegraph*, and *The Independent*. The team’s public astronomy talks reached over 11,000 people including the 2016 National Astronomy Meeting, the 2017 *New Scientist* Live festival, the 2016 Science Alive Festival in Hong Kong and the 2016 Cheltenham, Swansea, and Manchester Science Festivals. 

 As a result of over 100 school presentations, as well as activity workshops at the 2016 National Eisteddfod, the 2018 STEM Live event \(National Museum of Wales\), and several talks at the National Space Centre, over 8,900 pupils were directly informed of Cardiff’s research **\[5.8\]** 

 The team’s experience in developing public engagement activities from Cardiff astronomy research led to wider representation in many public\-engagement\-related committee and review roles including: Honorary Secretary of the Institute of Physics\-Wales Committee; reviewers for STFC’s Public Engagement schemes and evaluation framework; membership of the Institute of Physics UK Outreach & Public Engagement Advisory Group and Public Engagement grants panel; and invited talks at teacher education conferences in the USA and Greece. Gomez was awarded an MBE in the 2018 Queen’s Birthday Honours for her “ *services to astrophysics and astronomy and, in particular, for inspiring the next generation of physicists and astronomers by communicating her research to a wide audience*” **\[5.9\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at SOAS has openly challenged public perceptions that Fairtrade and other certification schemes improve conditions for the poorest people in producing countries. Initial research on the effects of Fairtrade certification on rural labour markets and wages and a subsequent systematic review of wider agricultural certification schemes, have had an impact on the practices of agricultural certification standard bodies \(including Fairtrade International and the ISEAL Alliance\) in terms of monitoring and assessment of the impact of the schemes as well as on standard setting. The research has informed the reform of the coffee sector in Ethiopia and has also changed public understanding of certification standards. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Fairtrade schemes award certifications to producers of commodities such as coffee, tea, bananas, flowers, cocoa etc. to reassure consumers that these are produced in relatively “decent” working conditions. Yet, prior to the research described in this case study, there had been virtually no independent research on the impact of such certifications on the poorest people, especially wage workers, and on the effectiveness of agricultural certification schemes in addressing rural poverty. Fairtrade was and remains the best known of these schemes and it has separate certification standards for ‘hired labour’ and ‘smallholder’ producer organizations \(SPOs\), based upon the assumption that smallholder producers did not employ significant numbers of wage workers. Fairtrade also claimed that rural producer cooperatives were democratic and egalitarian, again without a strong foundation in independently collected, methodologically careful research. Meanwhile, standards monitoring organizations like ISEAL \(the global membership organization for credible sustainability standards\) also lacked knowledge and capabilities in this respect. 

 SOAS\-led research has challenged such assumptions with two research projects. The first project was led by Christopher Cramer \(Professor of the Political Economy of Development\); the second by Carlos Oya \(Professor of the Political Economy of Development\). The research also engaged John Sender \(Emeritus Professor of Economics at SOAS\), Deborah Johnston \(then Professor of Economics, SOAS\), and Florian Schaefer at LSE. 

 In the first project \- Fairtrade, Employment, and Poverty Reduction in Ethiopia and Uganda, FTEPR \(2010\-2014, Department for International Development, GBP692,958\) \- the researchers carried out fieldwork in Ethiopia and Uganda. Surveys were conducted to compare labour markets and production, looking at areas with 1\) certified producer organizations; 2\) smallholder production with no Fairtrade certified organizations; and 3\) areas defined around large\-scale commercial plantations. In total, 1,700 people were interviewed, through individual interviews and focus group discussions – including cooperative leadership, private plantation and company managers and owners, policy officials and wage workers **\[3.3\]**. The research showed that huge numbers of very poor people depend for their survival on wage employment in small\-scale coffee and tea production in Ethiopia and Uganda. The key finding was that Fairtrade certification could not be associated with any positive outcomes for wage workers compared to other production arrangements **\[3.1\]**. This was the case both in larger scale flower farms in Ethiopia and in smallholder producer organizations \(SPOs\). Further, the research found that cooperatives were highly unequal organizations, in which the largest and best\-off producer\-members captured most of the limited gains from Fairtrade certification **\[3.2\]**. The research recommended changes to the claims made by Fairtrade as well as improved monitoring to ensure better wages and working conditions **\[3.2\]**. 

 Following the dissemination of the FTEPR findings, the Campbell Collaboration \(the leading international organisation promoting evidence\-based policy in the form of systematic reviews\) and 3ie\-International Initiative for Impact Evaluation commissioned and funded \(GBP71,624, 2014\-2016\) a systematic review of research on the impact of all agricultural certification schemes on socio\-economic outcomes for producers and wage workers in developing countries **\[3.4; 3.6\]**. 

 The systematic review carried out in 2016 and 2017 provided the first exhaustive and rigorous review of the state of the evidence on the impact of standards systems – certification \- in developing countries. The work entailed a critical review and analysis of the evidence from 43 quantitative impact evaluations that explored the effectiveness of certification schemes, and 136 qualitative studies examining the barriers to and enablers of effective certification schemes. It found some marginal, positive effects of certification schemes on producer prices and on certified farmer incomes but no effects on household incomes or assets and mild, negative effects on wages **\[3.4; 3.6\]**. This lack of clear effects was compounded by the limited evidence base for each outcome and by widely varying results across what studies there were **\[3.5; 3.6\]**. The study recommended that organizations revise their claims to effectiveness and improve their reporting practices and monitoring capabilities to ascertain the impact of their interventions.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has had an impact on the practices of specific organizations, especially Fairtrade and ISEAL, as well as on public understanding of certification schemes. Fairtrade has since changed its standards to pay far more attention to wages and working conditions in smallholder producer organizations. The research has also influenced the reform of the Ethiopian government policy for the coffee sector. 

####  Impact on monitoring and assessment of ‘ethical trading’ certification schemes 

 The Systematic Review **\[3.6\]** engaged representatives of the ISEAL Alliance as members of the project advisory group. ISEAL is the global membership organisation for certification schemes; most of the certifications covered in the Systematic Review are ISEAL members. Their involvement from the start facilitated the subsequent take\-up of some key recommendations. In her testimonial, the ISEAL Director of Impacts explains how the organisation has used the review as a “core resource” to forming the gathering, analysis and presentation of the evidence on the effectiveness of certification systems **\[5.1\]**. The director explains how the research has inspired ISEAL “to improve the quality of future studies and study reports”, as well to “integrate a regular systematic mapping of the literature on sustainability standards into our own operations”. Throughout the assessment period, the Systematic Review contributed to ongoing internal ISEAL discussions about the complexity of impact pathways and how to improve standards in order to meet poverty reduction goals. It raised awareness of the limited rigorous research on the impacts of standards on workers, thus providing an impetus to their fundraising for more research \- particularly on the impacts of activities undertaken by the standard systems beyond certification **\[5.1a\]**. Both projects have also shaped ISEAL commitments on how to communicate their impact more accurately to members, farmers, buyers and to the general public so that they are not misled. The report now sits on Evidensia, a platform founded in 2019 by the ISEAL Alliance, Rainforest Alliance and WWF with the support of the Global Environment Facility to improve research standards in the sector **\[5.1b\]**. The SOAS Systematic Review was cited in ISEAL’s presentation to the Global Sustainability Standards Symposium 2019 **\[5.1c, slides 13, 14, and 33\]**. Summing up the project’s impact, ISEAL writes that “Ultimately, this study provides much learning for sustainability standards and ISEAL will work with its member systems and the SOAS research team to learn from this review”. **\[5.1d p3\]**. 

 ISEAL members such as **UTZ** \(a certification scheme for the sustainable farming of coffee and cocoa\) and **Fairtrade** also individually acknowledged the Systematic Review. Fairtrade confirmed in January 2020 **\[5.2\]** that their Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning team had used the Systematic Review in \[text removed for publication\]. In their response to the review, UTZ explains that it contains important lessons that can inform their work in different areas. Specifically, in relation to their work on monitoring and evaluation, UTZ stated that a key lesson of the study was “the need to continue our investment in our M&E capacity, in order to monitor improvements and innovations to certification and evaluate impact. We will use the findings of the review to refine our Theory of Change and to unpack the underlying pathways of change and how these work in different contexts, for different farmers”. Moreover, UTZ also committed to “align and collaborate with other stakeholders to pool evaluation resources” **\[5.3 p4\]**. 

####  Impact on Fairtrade standard setting 

 After an initially hostile response, including legal threats that were then withdrawn and concerns that the FTEPR research findings might damage its reputation, Fairtrade acknowledged the utility of the SOAS research and engaged more constructively with its findings and recommendations. In June 2014, Harriet Lamb, then CEO of the Fairtrade Foundation, stated “We recognize and appreciate the insights their research gives into the type and conditions of employment of vulnerable farm workers \[…\]; we hope that the SOAS data will help address \[…\] how to better reach temporary labourers and casual workers and ensure benefits of trade include them” **\[5.4 p2\]**. A 2014 Fairtrade International and Flocert report \(FLOCert being the independently governed audit and certification body for Fairtrade\) cited the FTEPR research and recognized that workers in SPOs had been “largely overlooked”. Acknowledging that “Fairtrade’s work with farmers in cooperatives does not necessarily result in significant benefits trickling down to the workers”, the report noted that Fairtrade “will be working on this in 2015 and beyond” **\[p.24 – 5.5\]**. The annual Fairtrade report \(2017\) also cited the research and its findings concerning workers and wages in SPOs **\[p. 19 \- 5.6\]**. During a Fairtrade 2018 consultation to review SPO standards, the need to address the situation of workers in SPOs was discussed –  an issue not addressed at all in previous consultation rounds – although the consultation report indicates that many members \(who are mainly farmers/employers\) were resistant **\[5.7, p8\]**. 

 The 2016 completion review of Fairtrade’s Programme Partnership Arrangement with DFID, which was an opportunity to reflect on lessons learned over the previous period of DFID funded Fairtrade programmes, states that: “responding to research findings into working conditions and earnings of smallholder farmers, we have improved and revised the Hired Labour Standard with stronger protection and benefits for workers, launched a new project to improve the situation of workers within small farmer organizations and further improved our monitoring and evaluation systems to gather essential data on wages and working conditions to feed back into our work” **\[5.8 p27\].** The revised Fairtrade Standard for SPO \(April 2019\) amended the threshold for application of the standard so that now producers employing at least 10 workers should be subject to monitoring of working conditions, “\[to\] ensure that a larger number of workers in SPO  are covered by the requirements in the Standard”, to “strengthen the requirement \[that producers give and provide employment contracts to permanent workers\] and to promote decent work and reduction of risk of exploitative practices” **\[5.9 p9\]**. There has therefore been a clear shift in Fairtrade standards concerning wage employment in SPO, as recommended by the research. 

####  Influencing major reforms to the coffee sector in Ethiopia 

 FTEPR research also helped shape major reforms to the coffee sector in Ethiopia. After a presentation of the research to high\-level policy officials and coffee sector stakeholders in Addis Ababa \(in November 2013\), Cramer and Sender were invited to present to the then Prime Minister and his senior advisor, Dr. Arkebe Oqubay. This led to a three\-year engagement with the Prime Minister’s Office. The research team was involved in a coffee reform process led by Dr. Arkebe, for which Cramer and Sender wrote a coffee policy paper. A number of policy changes drew directly on the SOAS research findings and recommendations, including the transformation of the Jimma Agricultural Research Institute into a body with a singular focus on coffee; the need to exploit the potential for employment creation in coffee through prioritizing finance for exports; and allowing exporters and traders to invest directly in commercial coffee plantations **\[5.10\]**. 

####  Impact on media discourse and public understanding 

 The initial research \(and the related public dispute with Fairtrade itself\) has attracted extensive media and press attention and stimulated widespread international public debate. In May 2014 Christopher Cramer provided an overview of the Fairtrade research that was featured on the front page of The Observer **\[5.11a\]** as well as a letter to the Financial Times **\[5.11b\]**. The Observer article was shared online almost 500 times and led to an intense debate among readers appreciating or challenging the study and its findings. The now CEO of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data commented: “blanket rejection of a careful and well\-thought\-out study \[…\] is hardly an appropriate or adult response. The report does not reject the principle of Fair Trade but asks important questions about how it works in practice and there will be plenty of people wanting answers that have a convincing ring to them”. Another dedicated Guardian article **\[5.11c\]** was shared 1,234 times and attracted 338 comments from readers supporting or disagreeing with the research findings. One reader noted “this is a good article – it’s made me question my activities – but rather than turning my back on ethical shopping I would prefer reports like this to be used to put pressure on Fairtrade to do more to ensure that its producers are acting ethically through the chain...” **\[5.11d\]**. In June 2014 UK fair trade organization Traidcraft published a column **\[5.11e\]** in which they stated: “We welcome the research and we are keen to learn from it”. An online column in Forbes from contributor Tim Worstall \(Fellow, Adam Smith Institute in London\) reviewing the study findings was visited 23,787 times **\[5.11f\]**. The research was also covered by the Economist **\[5.11g\]** and other various print and online media in the UK, Europe, and the USA, for example in Der Spiegel **\[5.11h\]**, in 2014 and beyond. In 2019 the research was again cited in a Financial Times report **\[5.11i\]** \- the author noting that “Fairtrade International says it has since worked closely with the researchers to listen to their views and better understand some of their findings” – and in the Guardian **\[5.11j** – shared 858 times **\]**. In March 2020 the research was cited by media covering an investigation on Starbucks, Nespresso and child labour. The research has also been used as a benchmark when discussing other research projects on Fairtrade and certification schemes on public online platforms such as Twitter **\[5.11k\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted by members of the Community and Health Research Unit \(CaHRU\), funded by £3.5 million in grant funding from the NIHR, NIHR CLAHRC East Midlands, Health Foundation and Falck Foundation, has led to measurable improvements in prehospital care nationally and internationally. This work resulted in a range of new indicators for ambulance services, demonstrably improving processes of care in services throughout England. There has also been an uptake of these measures internationally \(in the US and Middle East\) and they have been used to update quality indicators by the UK health regulator, the Care Quality Commission, used in all UK ambulance services. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Context** 

 Ambulance services are providing more care for greater numbers of people with emergency conditions, which has led to a clinical and policy need to identify indicators of high\-quality care which enable improvements in care and outcomes. 

 Before we developed new outcome measures in 2009, ambulance services were largely measured on response times alone. Although appropriate as one measure of quality, for emergency conditions such as heart attack, stroke or cardiac arrest, they are not the only measure of care quality. 

 Ambulance services have increasingly been responding to patients with a wider range of clinical conditions than emergency conditions, which constitute fewer than 10% of attendances. A wider range of quality measures was needed, and it therefore became an NHS research priority to measure the wider clinical care provided by ambulance services rather than just timeliness of response. 

 **Outline of underpinning research** 

 CaHRU have interdisciplinary research\-based expertise in development and implementation of new quality measures \(clinical indicators\) to meet user, service and system need. The team led the development and evaluation of the first clinical indicators for ambulance services beginning in 2007. In 2017 members of the team, with collaborators, completed a 5\-year NIHR programme for applied research focussing on new, more patient\-centred ways of measuring ambulance care services through co\-produced research and collaborative implementation. 

 The research has provided, for the first time, information about the effectiveness,  quality and outcomes of different types of ambulance care provided to large populations of patients and supported quality improvement, clinical audit and evaluation of future service changes. The group has conducted several related studies examining variations in care \(e.g. in care of heart attack and stroke\), gaps in care \(e.g. pain management, patient experience\) and potential methods to address these \(development of new outcome measures such as care bundles for heart attack and stroke and methods to improve these\). The research activity conducted by the CaHRU team is translational and has led to improved quality of care and outcomes 

-  Systematic reviews and consensus studies have prioritised potential outcome  measures relevant to the NHS and patients. 

-  Epidemiological and cross\-sectional and qualitative studies have identified current  care quality, variations and gaps. 

-  Pilot and quasi\-experimental studies evaluating the introduction of new measures  and the effect on these of improvement initiatives. 

-  We created the first information dataset linking routine prehospital, hospital \(episode  statistics\) and mortality data to build risk adjustment models for mortality and non\- mortality outcomes: the models have been developed and assessed to determine  how well they measure effectiveness and quality of ambulance service care and their  practical use for quality improvement. 

 **Research Findings Related to Impact** 

 CaHRU led the development, pilot and evaluation of new clinical measures for ambulance services 2011 \[3.1\] and subsequently led an NIHR Programme for Applied Health Research \(£2M\), Pre\-hospital Outcomes for Evidence Based Evaluation \(PhOEBE 2011\-2017\), which developed new risk ambulance outcome measures \[3.2\]. The programme of research was undertaken in collaboration with ambulance services \(East Midlands and Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trusts\), other higher education institutions \(Sheffield and Swansea Universities\) and patient groups \(e.g. Sheffield Emergency Care Forum\). The programme led to the publication of new ambulance measures, some of which have been adopted nationally in the UK. 

 Our study investigating patient perspectives of prehospital experience found that of fundamental importance to patients was a sense of feeling reassured and this was enhanced by the professional behaviour of staff, which instilled  confidence in their care, good communication, a short wait for help; and improved continuity during the transfer to hospital. \[3.3\]. 

 We also showed in the PhOEBE programme above that pain management was a high priority outcome for patients. CaHRU\-led studies of pain management \[3.4, 3.5\] have shown that better prehospital treatment of pain is linked to more highly trained staff with greater access to higher potency pain relief. 

 CaHRU led a national study from 2009 to 2012, in collaboration with all the ambulance services in England, to identify, address and evaluate gaps in care based on novel outcome measures of care bundles for heart attack and stroke \[3.6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In summary, and detailed below, the research directly informed national UK policy and has been a key factor in improving ambulance care for emergency and other conditions by directly influencing care systems, regulatory indicators, ambulance services, paramedics, and service users throughout England and internationally. The research led directly to the development of new clinical quality indicators for ambulance services in England, to benchmarking of service quality, and supported initiatives to address gaps in care as detailed below. The work also featured in ‘Universities UK 100\+ ways universities have improved everyday life’, in ‘Relieving the pressures on the NHS through better training’ \[5.1\]. 

 CaHRU’s director, Siriwardena, led the development of the first clinical indicators \(e.g. recording of pain treatment and assessment before and after treatment\) used by English ambulance services \[3.1\], and through meetings with the UK health regulator, several indicators were subsequently adopted by for their performance assessment of services, including the concept of care bundles for heart attack and stroke \[3.6\] which are still used currently in the national Ambulance Quality Indicators for England \[5.2\]. 

 The research on indicator development \[3.2\] was featured in a national review of NIHR prehospital research and its impact, ‘Care at the Scene’, \[5.3,pg 35, study 11\] in which Derek Prentice, Chair of the Lay Group at the Royal College of Emergency Medicine stated “In striving for research based improvements and training for better outcomes we must always ensure that the primary focus remains the patient”. 

 Siriwardena was invited by Dr David Williams of the Institute for Health Improvement in the US, to provide advice to which led directly to the group’s work on indicators \(3.1, 3.6\)  being used in the US and Middle East \[5.4\] to inform indicator development and quality improvement initiatives abroad during this REF period \(pp 6, 7, 10, references 9, 12\). 

 In Qatar, this led to adoption of a care bundle for patients with heart attack based on that developed for England, and a peer reviewed publication citing CaHRU’s work, showed improvement during 2016 and 2017 in the bundle measure, from 39% pre\-improvement activities to 76% post\-improvement activities with sustained improvement at 12 months post implementation \[5.5\]. 

 To engage patients in understanding the change in UK ambulance indicators, key findings from the Prehospital Outcomes for Evidence Based Evaluation \(PhOEBE\) programme \[3.2\] led by Siriwardena, were developed into an animation by and for patients and the public, which had over 2000 views within 6 months of its launch in November 2017 \[5.6\]. 

 The findings also fed into the UK Ambulance Research Programme and informed new Ambulance Quality Indicators introduced in 2017. For example, rather than the previous 8\-minute and 19\-minute response time targets for ambulance services, they are now benchmarked using mean and 90<sup>th</sup> centile response times as a direct result of the PhOEBE programme \[3.2\]. Subsequently, these new indicators were adopted by all ambulance services in England \[5.7\], designed to benchmark and improve care and are now being used by the UK regulator as part of their assessment of ambulance care quality. 

 The findings on improvements in prehospital care were cited in a national report into building healthy cities \[5.8\], ‘looking at how universities act as anchor institutions in their cities and regions: active, engaged institutions, taking pride in our community, tackling real\-world challenges.’ The report notes that “Although the research was initially undertaken with East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust, it has since led to changes in the behaviour of ambulance service nationally” \( *pg 15\-16*\). 

 An invited keynote presentation by Siriwardena at the North American EMS Physicians \(NAEMSP\) conference 2018 led to CaHRU’s research informing quality measures in North America. The new EMS Compass measures \[5.9\] were introduced in 2019 and include \(for example\) the trauma pain indicator arising from our work, which involves two pain scores and a reduction in pain as an outcome measure. 

 Siriwardena was part of the faculty for the NAEMSP Quality and Safety course 2019\-2020 \( [https://naemsp.org/career\-development/ems\-quality\-and\-safety\-course/](https://naemsp.org/career-development/ems-quality-and-safety-course/)\) and in this capacity provided advice, which sought to improve care, on EMS measures for ambulance services in North America, Canada and the Lebanon.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 As evidenced by the SARS\-CoV\-2 pandemic, pathogenic viruses represent a major global threat to human health and wellbeing. Over the last decade, Bangor research has developed a range of analytical tools, technologies and models for the effective surveillance of harmful viruses in the wider environment, leading to risk\-based industry standards. Working in partnership with UK and devolved governments, our wastewater\-based surveillance tools have been adopted, piloted and rolled out at the national scale: \(a\) for whole\-community monitoring of COVID\-19 incidence, \(b\) to provide an early warning system to protect critical national infrastructure from SARS\-CoV\-2 outbreaks, \(c\) as a decision support tool to show which city areas should be targeted for mass testing, and \(d\) to evaluate the success of COVID\-19 mitigation measures. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The COVID\-19 pandemic will shape this generation. It has highlighted how viruses can severely disrupt society, community wellbeing and at the time of writing is responsible for the loss of 121,000 lives in the UK. Over the last decade, research at Bangor has developed a range of quantitative analytical and modelling tools to enable the tracking of human pathogenic viruses for public health surveillance and risk assessment purposes. This is exemplified by Bangor’s work on the identification of novel betacoronaviruses in animal reservoirs \[3.1\], the metaviromic characterisation of viral communities in the environment \[3.2, 3.a\], and quantitative determination of viruses in a range of environmental matrices, including human sewage, river water, sediments, estuaries, coastal waters and food \[3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.a\-3.l\]. Meeting this research need has been strongly driven and financially supported by industry \(e.g. water companies, food producers, shellfisheries\), local authorities and government agencies \(e.g. Food Standards Agency, Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Public Health Wales, Department of Health and Social Care\) as well as by a wide range of large UKRI and EU grants \[3.a\-3.l\]. 

 The UK produces 10,000,000,000 litres of sewage each day. This wastewater represents one of the main routes by which harmful viruses can enter the environment. Bangor University work has revealed that many harmful viruses of national importance \(e.g. Norovirus, Rotavirus, Hepatitis A/E\) are present in very high abundance in both untreated and treated sewage \(10<sup>6</sup>\-10<sup>9</sup> viral particles per litre\), particularly during localized disease outbreaks \[3.3, 3.5, 3.d, 3.e, 3.j\]. Human contact with sewage therefore poses a major risk to public health. Bangor’s research provided early evidence that viral monitoring of wastewater may provide a cheap, unbiased and effective tool to monitor levels of infection in a whole community. This approach proved particularly suitable for viral diseases which frequently don’t result in hospitalization \(i.e. not reported\), but which Public Health England estimate cost the UK economy GBP200,000,000 per year in terms of loss of working days and health care \(e.g. Norovirus\) \[3.3\]. 

 Bangor University’s research has also shown that, in contrast to faecal bacteria, many pathogenic viruses are not effectively removed by conventional sewage treatment, inevitably leading to their release and accumulation in important environmental reservoirs where human contact can occur \(e.g. sediments, bathing waters, beaches, shellfish\) \[3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.a, 3.e\]. Working directly with water companies, the research showed that Norovirus release in both untreated and treated sewage can lead to a rapid accumulation of Norovirus in shellfish, and that the virus can remain infectious even after light cooking \[3.5, 3.a, 3.b, 3.c\]. This led to work with EU agencies to alter legislation designed to protect bathing and shellfish waters, so that it also captured the risk posed by enteric viruses. Support for this came from an industry\-funded critical review of the risk of Norovirus infection from the consumption of shellfish using epidemiological data \[3.f\]: our analysis revealed that 16% \(11,800 cases/year\) of food\-borne Norovirus outbreaks were attributed to the consumption of oysters between 1992 and 2014. Critical to the introduction of viral standards, however, are the validation of methods that enable accurate quantification of infectious viral particles in environmental matrices. A range of methods to distinguish between infective and non\-infective \(damaged\) Norovirus particles were therefore developed \[3.3\] and in collaboration with the EU, water companies and industry bodies \(e.g. Shellfish Association of Great Britain, Seafish, Food Standards Agency\) to ensure that proposed changes to the legislation were robust \[3.e, 3.f\]. 

 Most recently, partnering with the Food Standards Agency \(FSA\), a hydrodynamically\-driven risk modelling tool was developed which takes key information \(including sewage discharge, river flow, weather and tidal patterns\) to predict, in real\-time, the likelihood of viral contamination in the coastal zone \[3.g\]. This *active management* tool is now under testing by the FSA as a mechanism to reduce the risk of shellfish contamination, reduce food\-borne outbreaks and subsequent community transmission, and protect the livelihoods of UK shellfisheries valued at GBP20,000,000 per annum. 

 At the start of the COVID\-19 pandemic Bangor researchers, led by Professor D. Jones, identified that faecal shedding of SARS\-CoV\-2 into wastewater could be used to provide an unbiased estimate of the prevalence of COVID\-19 within an entire community \[3.6\]. Building on the novel methodologies developed for quantifying and sequencing \(by metaviromics\) human pathogenic viruses in water and shellfish \[3.2, 3.3\], viral surveillance approaches to track SARS\-CoV\-2 in major UK cities \(e.g. Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff\) was rapidly adapted and deployed. In the first COVID\-19 wave Bangor research showed that viral levels in sewage accurately reflected cases in the wider community, validating the approach. In addition, the Bangor team developed novel human faecal markers \(e.g. CrAssphage\) to allow for normalisation for external factors such as wastewater flow and dilution \[3.4\]. Further, through quantitative risk assessment and infectivity screening together with Welsh Water and United Utilities we showed that the risk of contracting SARS\-CoV\-2 through environmental routes involving wastewater and biosolids contamination was extremely low \[3.l\]. The Bangor team also worked with the NERC Biomolecular Analysis Facility to develop new sequencing methods for SARS\-CoV\-2 in wastewater allowing the Department of Health and Social Care \(DHSC\) to identify and quantify the abundance of SARS\-CoV\-2 variants circulating in the population. After the first COVID\-19 wave Bangor developed enhanced high\-throughput methods for viral extraction from wastewater allowing rapid scaling up of the technology. This led to the establishment of the national wastewater\-based surveillance programme run by the DHSC. Our COVID\-19 work was supported by 3 UKRI grants and 3 grants from government agencies \(DHSC, Defra and Welsh Government\) totalling GPB2,800,000 \[3.i, 3.j\]. Bangor’s research provided key evidence to SAGE and Welsh Government’s Technical Advisory Group of COVID\-19.

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  a\) Industry standards for shellfish in relation to Norovirus 

 Bangor’s research into microbial pathogen transport in catchments and estuaries has stimulated initiation, and informed direction of, regulatory development work undertaken by regulators \(Food Standards Agency \[FSA\], Environment Agency \[EA\]\) and industry \(Seafish, Shellfish Association of Great Britain \[SAGB\]\), on potential for risk\-based assurance schemes for shellfish, linking environmental risk predictors \(e.g. rainfall\) to temporal controls of shellfish harvesting. 

 Accumulation of human enteric pathogens in filter\-feeding shellfish is a potential human health risk that is regulated through monitoring of *E. coli* as an indicator of faecal contamination. This is a significant regulatory burden for industry, with periods of poor water quality leading to restrictions on harvesting or closure of production areas. In 2016, Professor Le Vay chaired a large stakeholder meeting \(industry, FSA, EA, Public Health England, Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science\) investigating industry concerns about the regulatory system, following an unprecedented and unexplained high *E. coli* event and closure of shellfish production across SW England. Bangor’s fundamental research into the processes governing the transport and fate of viruses and bacteria in coastal waters and shellfish receptors \[3.d\-3.f\] was then used by the FSA to devise a policy roadmap and new active management systems for minimising shellfish contamination and public health risk. The Director of Operations at Seafish reported “without doubt the underpinning research and support provided by Bangor University has been... instrumental in driving change and improvements across the shellfish regulatory and production landscape” \[5.1\]. 

 Professor Le Vay provided science advice to the UK Shellfish Stakeholders Working Group \(SSWG\), a UK\-wide body formed to address industry concerns about impacts of frequent closures and public\-health downgrades of shellfish production areas. This led to Bangor being commissioned to undertake a full\-scale proof of concept of adaptive management of shellfish waters \(Developing an Assurance Scheme for Shellfish and Human Health – DASSHH \[3.g\]\) and advising Seafish \(Le Vay, Seafish Expert Panel\) and FSA, in review of potential for changes to regulation of shellfish waters. Based on this work, the development of a risk\-based approach to the classification of shellfish production waters via DASSHH was identified as a critical action in the English Aquaculture Strategy 2020 \(Le Vay is member of Seafood 2040, Aquaculture Leaders Group\) \[5.1, 5.2\]. 

 Half of EU aquaculture production comes from live bivalve shellfish, with a value of over €1200,000,000 \(01\-2016\), supporting over 8000 companies and over 60,000 jobs. Bangor research focused on detecting and quantifying pathogenic viruses in various environmental and animal matrices including wastewater and shellfish. It also highlighted the inability of the approved Norovirus testing method to discriminate between active and inactive virus leading to inaccurate quantification of Norovirus in environmental samples. This work informed effective industry rebuttal of amendments to Regulation \(EC\) 854/2004 to include statutory limits for Norovirus in shellfish harvested for human consumption \(tabled in 2015\). This helped secure thousands of jobs and live shellfish to continue to be sold safely to the market by avoiding a projected 50% reduction in sales during winter months over 5 years \[5.3\]. 

####  b\) National scale surveillance of SARS\-CoV\-2: informing government and agency planning to protect public health 

 Bangor’s research directly led to the creation and implementation of the national wastewater surveillance programme for tracing COVID\-19 in the UK \[5.4, 5.5, 5.6\]. This programme is run by UK Government via the Joint Biosecurity Centre, Department of Health and Social Care and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. UK Government has invested over GBP40,000,000 into the programme. It directly supports decision making \(e.g. success of non\-pharmaceutical interventions; NPIs\) and the targeting of resources in the *Test and Trace* programme \(e.g. where to deploy surge testing\). Bangor provided the proof\-of\-concept and validated viral analysis methods which were subsequently adopted by the national programme \[5.4\]. Defra’s Project Manager reported that ‘ *Bangor University’s work has significantly impacted our work as part of the national response to COVID\-19’,* adding that the ‘ *Pioneering research of Bangor University early in the pandemic formed the basis of the establishment of the English national COVID\-19 Wastewater Monitoring Programme’* and that the Programme’s success has depended on the *‘early engagement with the* \[Defra\] *Programme team to understand and embed policy response needs into Bangor’s research service at the outset, coupled with clear communication of progress and codesign of solutions to complex or sensitive issues surrounding handling of the pandemic response’* \[5.4\] *.* 

 In the period Aug\-Dec 2020, the national programme has provided near real\-time information on levels of SARS\-CoV\-2 circulating in all the major towns and cities in the UK \(4 samples/week at 44 core sites\) \[5.4\]. This is used to evaluate the success of NPIs and also to track the spread of newly emerged variants of concern in the UK \(e.g. Lineage B.1.1.7., Kent variant\). Viral analysis was undertaken jointly by the Environment Agency and Bangor University laboratories. The Director General for the Joint Biosecurity Centre, UK reported that Bangor’s Wastewater programme enabled them “to respond to sometimes rapidly emerging situations as part of our national Test & Trace Efforts” confirming that the Bangor team made “a very critical difference at this time of national crisis” \[5.6\]. 

 In addition, wastewater testing in the suburbs of 20 UK cities \(in\-sewer monitoring\) has been used to directly inform decision making on a local scale. Together with United Utilities and the Department of Health and Social Care, Bangor undertook the pilot programme in Liverpool where data was collected from 8 suburbs and the information used to geographically target surge testing and introduce non\-pharmaceutical interventions. Following the pilot, it was subsequently rolled out to all major UK cities \[5.4\]. 

 Bangor is the central analysis laboratory for the Department of Health and Social Care’s critical infrastructure COVID\-19 prevention programme which aims to protect national supply chains. This programme collects wastewater from 25 key industrial facilities \(e.g. meat processing plants, distribution depots\) daily and reports within 24 hours on levels of COVID\-19 incidence within the workforce. This has successfully identified COVID\-19 outbreaks within the workforce, followed by surge testing to identify infected individuals and the introduction of effective control measures. 

 In addition to SARS\-CoV\-2 the Welsh Government and Public Health Wales have used the Bangor laboratories to monitor other infectious diseases of public health concern \(e.g. influenza A/B, Respiratory syncytial virus, Enterovirus D68\) to inform planning \[5.5\]. Professor D. Jones chairs the Welsh Government COVID technical advice group and sits on the UK Parliament SAGE sub\-committee, Transmission in the Wider Environment which has produced many guidance documents to UK and Welsh Government on COVID\-19 related environment issues and its mitigation, including those associated with wastewater. The Chief Scientific Advisor for Health in Wales reported that Bangor’s research “has had a major impact on Welsh Government’s response to Covid\-19”, and added that “the epidemiological analysis enabled by this work has provided vital insights to Welsh Government…..Ministers to inform the response to Covid\-19” \[5.5\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Open University research on participatory performative methodologies led to two projects, *Who Are We?* and *Picturing Climate*. These enabled stakeholders to explore societal issues including migration and climate change leading to impact in two primary areas, namely \(1\) impact on creativity, culture and society, and \(2\) impact on understanding, learning and participation. They also had impact in two secondary areas, \(3\) impact on public services, and \(4\) impact on social welfare. These impacts were international in reach and significance \(in UK, Cuba, and Bosnia and Herzegovina\) with beneficiaries that included: the general public; migrant, refugee and BAME communities, including artists; arts and cultural organizations; young people; and educators. This work has opened up prestigious cultural institutions such as Tate Modern to marginalised groups and has enabled communities to confront issues they had not considered before.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Isin’s** research extends traditional conceptions of citizenship as formal membership in a polity **\[O1\]**. **Czajka’s** research extends traditional conceptions of democracy as grounded in and enacted through mechanisms and institutions of the state **\[O2, O3\]**. As **Isin** and **Czajka** separately argue, citizenship and democracy can also be conceptualised through the lens of performativity. This understanding of citizenship and democracy as performative – that is, as practices and processes that are differently enacted and contested through a variety of public, political ‘performances’ – contributed to the conceptualisation of the arts, and particularly, participatory arts, as both a site and a tool through which citizenship and democracy are enacted and contested. **Isin** and **Czajka’s** research conceptualises citizenship and democracy as performative and draws attention to the often unconventional ‘performances’ of groups and individuals marginalised in mainstream political discourses. This makes visible and places centre\-stage the political practices, participation and contribution of groups including migrants, refugees, ethnic and religious minorities, and youth, among others. These innovative approaches to citizenship and democracy underpinned the understanding of participatory arts as a site of citizenship and democracy, providing the impetus for the *Who Are We?* and *Picturing Climate* projects as creative and innovative pathways to impact. They were instrumental to the conceptualisation of participatory arts methodologies as open, accessible, and affective modes of engagement on salient contemporary political issues. They also served as a point of departure for conceptualising participatory arts methodologies as an effective method for making visible the contributions of minorities \(particularly migrants, refugees and BAME communities, regardless of their formal, legal status\) to discourses and practices of citizenship and democracy. 

 The programmes, in turn: 

1.  promoted learning, understanding, participation and action on two of the most urgent and contested political issues of the day – migration \( *Who Are We?*\) and climate change \( *Picturing Climate*\) – through the media and methodologies of performative and participatory arts; 

1.  made visible the political engagement by non\-citizen, migrant, refugee, and other un\- or under\-represented minority groups on issues of migration, citizenship and democracy \( *Who Are We?*\). 

 By foregrounding the work of migrant and refugee artists, and ensuring the involvement and participation of migrant, refugee, BAME and other marginalized communities, *Who Are We?* was itself a critical, participatory performance of citizenship and democracy by groups and individuals often marginalised or ‘othered’ by mainstream political discourses and practices **\[O4\]**. Through the deployment of performative methodologies, *Picturing Climate* democratised understanding of and engagement with climate change by bringing it to the forefront of agendas of groups and communities who had not previously perceived it as a priority issue.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The *Who Are We?* Programme \(2017\-2019\) was hosted by Tate Exchange at Tate Modern, while *Picturing Climate* activities \(2019\) took place in Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Jordan, with a final four\-day programme at Tate Exchange. These public engagement and knowledge exchange programmes served as pathways to the following significant international impacts. 

###  \(1\) Impact on creativity, culture and society 

 *Who are We?* was a centrepiece programme by which “ *Tate Exchange and Tate \[Modern\] opened its doors to artistic and cultural expression from marginalised and diverse migrant audiences*” **\[C1\]**, enabling migrant, refugee, and BAME artists of 17 nationalities to participate in Tate Exchange **\[C8\]**. As noted by Counterpoints Arts, “ *our partnership with OU academics was paramount to the delivery of the Tate Exchange programme*”, because “ *by bringing together the work of migrant and refugee artists with interdisciplinary academic research, it became feasible to see how citizenship as performance occurs through the prism of public installation*” **\[C8\]**. Engagement with OU academics “ *resulted in a shared and publicly beneficial approach at the Tate Exchange \[…\] reconciling the narratives of performed citizenship through civic engagement with the arts*” **\[C8\]**. As attested to by the Head of Tate Exchange, the programme “ *\[…\] \[laid\] the path that culminated in the Tania Bruguera Hyundai Turbine Hall commission and that continues as embedded in the activity at Tate Exchange*” **\[C1\]**. Collaborations between OU academics and participating artists also led to the co\-production of new artistic and cultural artefacts that were displayed both during the programme and online, **\[C5, C9\]**, attracting the largest audience of any Tate Exchange programme **\[C2\]**. 

 *Who Are We?* not only contributed to changes in the professional practice of the aforementioned cultural organizations, Tate Exchange and Counterpoints Arts, but also to changes in the professional practice of individual artists **\[C7\]**, generating new ways of thinking that continue to influence their practice. **Czajka’s** work with photographer Eva Sajovic on migrants and refugees significantly influenced the artist’s individual creative practice, helping Sajovic “ *to construct a sound theoretical framework*” by “ *clarifying a lens through which \[she\] considered \[her\] practice*” **\[C7\]**. The collaboration also helped Sajovic work through key ethical and political questions that emerged in her work, questions “ *that were so profound that they had the potential to stall \[her\] practice*” **\[C7\]**. By collaborating with **Czajka**, the photographer was subsequently able to exhibit some of her work at Media Nox Gallery in Slovenia and at The Migration Museum in London. Sajovic further testified that the collaboration with **Czajka** “ *challenged some of the established ways of looking at the problem of representation of the displaced*” and “ *shifted the way \[participants\] viewed the topic*” **\[C7\]**. 

 *Picturing Climate* likewise impacted the professional practice of international cultural institutions and artists. Samuel Riera, Cuban artist and director of Riera Studio, Havana, said Riera Studio’s participation “ *had a significant impact on our own practice*” **\[C10\]**. As a “ *direct result of Picturing Climate \[…\] we went on to develop a series of work titled Evolving Natura \[…\] \[which\] explore\[d\] the relationships between the natural and man\-made worlds*”, and which was subsequently exhibited at the Thomas Nickles Project in New York **\[C10\]**. Riera Studio had never previously linked environment, climate change, food security and livelihoods with performative and arts methodologies **\[C10\]**. As a result of *Picturing Climate*, their work now embeds environmental principles \(e.g. sourcing local, eco\-friendly materials\) and includes more projects and collaborations exploring environmental issues through art **\[C10\]**. Riera noted that *Picturing Climate* was a “ *pioneering project*” in Cuba, where climate change is not high on the agenda, and where creative and arts\-based methodologies are rarely used to engage publics on social or political issues **\[C6, C10\]**. 

###  \(2\) Impact on understanding, learning and participation 

 As part of *Who Are We?* **Czajka’s** collaboration with designer Nele Vos resulted in an interactive installation titled, *Citizenshop*, which explored the controversial issue of “ *citizenship by investment*”. The installation engaged a diverse audience in a dialogue on citizenship, enhancing public understanding of the different paths to the acquisition of citizenship **\[C2\]**. Visitors’ conceptualisations of citizenship were critically challenged, enabling them to “ *reimagin\[e\] the concept*”, with one commenting: “ *It was shocking though to see the reality of the double standards*” **\[C2\]**. **Czajka** and Vos then co\-produced an interactive, open\-access educational game, *Uneven Journeys*, which created an immersive, online experience enabling students to learn about and compare the journey an asylum seeker, an economic migrant and an investor might take to the UK **\[C3\]**. *Who Are We?* also generated other open\-access educational materials on the use of participatory arts in education on social and political issues **\[C3\]**. The resources were utilised by 819 unique visitors from across Europe and the UK **\[C4\]**. 

 In the first year, *Who Are We?* attracted 4,768 visitors. 18% of these visitors self\-identified as BAME and 38% were under the age of 25, as compared with 15% and 27% respectively for the Tate Modern in general, contributing to the diversification of Tate Modern audiences **\[C8\]**. The programme also generated significant media interest, and was featured in *Arts Industry*, *The Big Issue*, *Southwark News* and *Frugl*, which, in turn, contributed to generating a more diverse audience for the programme and to widening impact beyond the directly participating audience **\[C2\]**. In its second year, *Who Are We?* expanded beyond Tate Modern and London to include underrepresented artists and communities in the north of England and the nations, “ *challeng\[ing\] the dominance and centricity of the capital in terms of funding and opportunity*”, and making it possible for “ *smaller, more locally based arts organisations and migrant artists to contribute to a process of mutual learning*” **\[C9\]**. Over its three years, the project also attracted a number of student groups who, according to one teacher, came away from the programme with “ *a new energy and interest around language learning which they did not have before*” **\[C5\]**. *Picturing Climate* attracted over 2,200 visitors, including a number of diverse student groups and young people, some of whom visited the programme as part of their school curriculum **\[C6\]**. 

###  \(3\) Impact on public services 

 *Picturing Climate*, using performative methodologies to explore the links between the environment and post\-conflict societies and economies, was described as novel and innovative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and had a significant impact on the learning of local artists and educators involved **\[C6\]**. They had been skeptical about exploring ‘soft’ issues like climate change in the context of a post\-conflict society, where much ‘harder’ political issues were at stake. They were surprised to learn how much environmental degradation there was in Bosnia, how closely tied it was to corruption and other political issues in post\-conflict environments, and how useful performative and arts methodologies were for exploring these issues with young people **\[C6\]**. 

 Climate change is not part of school curricula in either Cuba or Bosnia, and arts methodologies are largely absent, as rote learning is still the norm. *Picturing Climate* generated interest in including both environmental issues and creative methodologies in school curricula **\[C6, C10\]**. As noted by Riera Studio, following *Picturing Climate*, teachers and parents in schools in Havana were asking for similar programmes, with Riera Studio taking on a role in their delivery, and in training local teachers on how to deliver them **\[C6, C10\]**. Statements from teachers and a local government official in Bosnia suggest that the project has helped them to see how these issues and methodologies could be incorporated into the local curriculum and that changes would be made as a result **\[C6\]**. 

###  \(4\) Impact on social welfare 

 *Who Are We?* opened up access to Tate Modern, enabling refugees and other migrant and minority communities \(including artists\) to feel more included and better integrated into UK cultural institutions and spaces from which they previously felt excluded **\[C5, C8\]**. One artist noted, “ *A lot of the women…are quite marginalised and they are quite amazed at how their work has been valued and celebrated \[...\] and that's very, very, important*” **\[C5\]**. This impact has been multiplied by the prestige and reach of Tate Modern as a cultural institution, and the influence the programme had on Tate Exchange “ *open\[ing\] its doors to artistic and cultural expression from marginalised and diverse migrant audiences*” **\[C1\]**. 

 Other migrant, refugee and BAME visitors described as “healing” and “ *empowering*” hearing their languages, stories and experiences reflected at Tate Modern **\[C5, C8\]**. As one visitor described, “ *to hear my language \[…\] it makes me feel a lot more connected to everything that is going on*” **\[C5\]**. Another said, "" *It almost pushes me to cry \[…\] because for so many years what has been happening to the Kurdish people in Turkey has not had any space in the mainstream media \[...\]. You can’t underestimate the importance of an exhibition like this at the Tate Modern*” **\[C5\]**. 

 *Who Are We?* also enhanced public understanding of the experiences of marginalised groups, particularly refugees. Visitor feedback and evaluations indicated an enhanced or changed understanding of the experiences of migrants and refugees and, in at least one case, a visitor was inspired to volunteer at a refugee support organization, having gained a much clearer understanding of the experiences of migrants and refugees **\[C2, C5\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 King’s Centre for Military Health Research \(KCMHR\) is the main source of independent high\-quality data on the mental health and wellbeing of the UK Armed Forces, both serving and ex\-serving. King’s research has had three groups of impacts. First, by providing ongoing epidemiological data from a major cohort of military personnel we have contested the media led stereotype that those who have served are “mad, bad and sad”. This narrative can be damaging to the health and wellbeing of personnel, reduces their employment prospects, and increases stigma.  Countering it is a key government policy objective, for which data from KCMHR are the most important resource. This is synergistic with our second impact \- by describing areas of genuine unmet need, our research has changed government policy to ensure greater support, including access to care for personnel, veterans and their families. Third, by providing evidence on the effectiveness or otherwise of specific interventions we have changed policy decisions, including those on post\-deployment screening and women holding combat roles.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 King’s research into military mental health is recognised as world leading: scientometric analyses showed that King’s researchers Wessely, Greenberg & Fear were the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> highest contributors to the wider field of military health research. 

 **King’s has conducted health surveillance of military personnel.** Since 2004, King’s has conducted a representative longitudinal cohort study of more than 8000 UK military personnel, including those who have left the service, which has addressed health and well being outcomes of those who were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. We have published over 350 papers using data from this study. Our research has consistently shown that the vast majority of those who have served do not experience mental health problems before or after service, and that the much predicted “tsunami” of such problems has not occurred. However, in the third “sweep” of the cohort conducted in 2015\-17, we highlighted an overall modest increase in PTSD \(from 4% to 6%\), with the greatest increase in the ex\-serving personnel who had previous experience of combat deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan \(17%\), highlighting the importance of ongoing support following discharge from military service **\(1\)**. 

#  King’s research has identified frequency and patterns of offending in military personnel. 

 There have been frequent reports of ex\-serving military personnel being imprisoned, contributing to stigmatisation by adding to the “bad” of the “mad, bad, sad” narrative sometimes used about this group. Using the first record linkage of its kind using military personnel records and national crime records, we were able to demonstrate that overall age\-standardised convictions and incarceration \(1.7% versus 7.0%\) were lower in the military cohort than in the general population **\(2\)**. However our data also drew attention to the exception – an increase in violent offending, particularly in younger age groups, which was directly linked to traumatic combat exposure and mediated by alcohol misuse and PTSD. 

 **King’s provided evidence on the changing nature of help seeking.** King’s research on barriers to care assessed help\-seeking behaviours in 1,450 military personnel and veterans who reported symptoms of mental disorder **\(3\)**. We were able to show a steady increase in help seeking over the lifetime of the cohort, such that in the latest data 55% percent had accessed medical support, whilst 86% had used informal support, countering the popular belief that personnel are more reluctant than other groups to seek help. However, there are still barriers to help\-seeking, the commonest being the view that “I can or should be able to manage this myself *”*. For some, seeking help came only after reaching a crisis point. Having a strong social network that encourages help\-seeking and the media’s increased discussions around mental health were positive influencers on the decision to seek support. King’s qualitative research showed that barriers may change over time and depending upon an individual’s circumstances, highlighting the importance of understanding barriers to help\-seeking when designing mental health services **\(4\)**. 

 **King’s research has highlighted the importance of supporting military families.** King’s conducted the first systematic research on the impact of service on military families including potential adversities such as mobility, absence through deployments, threat of, and actual, physical injury and the psychological effects of deployment on service personnel.  We studied the combined effects of these factors on spouses, partners and children’s mental health and wellbeing. It had long been assumed, based on anecdotes, that frequent deployment of a parent, usually the father, was responsible for the known excess in military families of “problem children”, or those identified as having special educational needs. We provided the first evidence that this was untrue. Instead, it was linked to serious illness or injury of service personnel which had a profound impact on families, including poor mental health, relationship pressures, employment and financial pressures, and burden placed on children to support and provide care. We also found inconsistent knowledge and access to support services, identifying gaps in provision for military families **\(5\)**. 

 **King’s has evaluated how changes in policies being proposed by the Ministry of Defence affect mental health.** There has been debate about the use of screening to identify mental disorders following deployment – a practice which is routine in USA, Australia and Canada but has not been implemented in the UK. We first showed that pre\-deployment screening carried out before deploying personnel to Iraq did not reduce post deployment mental health problems, and instead had unintended consequences for both individuals and the Armed Forces, particularly for “false positives”. However the question of post\-deployment screening, as practised by many nations, remained open. In 2017, King’s delivered the first ever cluster randomised controlled trial of post deployment mental health screening anywhere on a large sample of UK Armed Forces personnel recently returned from combat deployment in Afghanistan. The study, funded by the US Department of Defense, found conclusively that screening did not improve mental health outcomes \(depression, anxiety, PTSD and alcohol misuse\) and was also not effective at improving help\-seeking **\(6\)**. 

 The UK Armed Forces have debated the role of women in “ground close combat” \(WGCC\) roles.  One key to policy change is whether such roles would be associated with unacceptable increase in psychiatric injury among women exposed to such duties. In 2017, King’s researched this question, including the impact of combat exposure and impact on help\-seeking should the WGCC policy be implemented. The research concluded that rates of PTSD in women in combat roles was no different to that seen in men, and only minor changes to support requirements would be needed for women undertaking the ground close combat role **\(7\)**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **King’s research has informed high level policy on military mental health.** Since the REF2014 case study that described the early post\-deployment interventions influenced by King’s research, our work has been used extensively to inform Government policy on the mental health and wellbeing of serving and ex\-serving personnel and their families. It has further informed the charity sector in terms of their advocacy and service provision. The key Government strategy, Defence People Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2017\-2022 **\[A1\]** was influenced by King’s research over several years **\[A2\]**. The 350 plus papers from the King’s cohort study **\(e.g. 1, 2\)** collectively comprise the majority of evidence used to support top level policy making by the UK Ministry of Defence on military mental health and wellbeing  **\[A3, A4\]**. 

 In 2014/2015 the House of Commons Defence Select Committee \(HCDC\) scrutinised the way that Government strategies uphold the military covenant in relation to those injured, mentally or physically, as a result of military service. The resulting HCDC report: Armed Forces Covenant: Military Casualties was informed by King’s research into the long\-term mental health trajectories of military personnel. King’s researchers gave oral and written evidence **\[A5\]**. The Committee concluded that whilst the UK provides world\-class care to injured serving personnel, there was concern about the support provided for those developing or living with longer\-term physical, mental and neurological conditions. This was one of five HCDC sessions on various topics where King’s researchers were invited to give evidence. 

 The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology \(POST\) produced a POSTnote **\[A6\]** based on the conclusions of the 2014/15 HCDC report indicating that the needs of military personnel who may be suffering long term conditions should be addressed. This cited King’s research 35 times, and informed policy makers of trends and mental health needs in the military population. 

 King’s research underpinned the Defence People Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2017\-2022 **\[A1\]** which set the scene for Government policy on mental health and wellbeing.  Of the 31 peer\-reviewed academic papers used to support the strategy, 27 were produced by King’s. The Strategy covers all aspects of military mental health, including help\-seeking, stigma, deployment mental health, Reserve Forces mental health, child and family health, trauma risk management and the effect of “overstretch”. All these recommendations were underpinned by King’s research **\[A2, A3, A4\].** The Strategy also led to the establishment of the Office of Veterans Affairs \(OVA\) within the Cabinet Office **\[A7, A8\],** which continues to support the ongoing King’s Military Cohort, now renamed the Legacy Cohort, since most of its members have now left the Armed Forces. It remains the most trusted source of data on health and wellbeing of veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and was recently accessed for a rapid investigation into how COVID\-19 has affected military veterans **\[A9\]**. Wessely now sits on the new Veterans’ Board formed in 2020 which oversees the provision of services to military personnel and veterans, and the health and wellbeing of military families **\[A10\].** 

#  King’s research has informed advocacy by groups representing military personnel. 

 Several military charities have benefited from King’s research ensuring an evidence\-base both for their advocacy and for the services they provide. For example: the Royal British Legion’s response to NHS England’s consultation on “Developing mental health services for veterans in England” **\[B1\]** is informed by the research which they commissioned King’s to carry out **\[B2\].**  Also, the Forces in Mind Trust \(FiMT\) Policy Statement on Health **\[B3\]** is influenced by King’s research into stigma and the barriers to help\-seeking **\[B4\].** 

 **King’s research has reduced stigma around military mental health.** King’s research **\(e.g. 2\)** has reduced harmful stigmatising views of military personnel, veterans and their families, and has, as the NHSE Director responsible for the Armed Forces services explained, “helped counter the sometimes negative impact of the stereotype of veterans as being ‘mad, bad and sad’” **\[C\].** 

 **King’s research provided evidence leading to improvements and investment in a new initiative providing NHS mental health services for military personnel.** By demonstrating the extent of mental health needs within the military, and the barriers to seeking help in this population, King’s research led to NHS England \(NHSE\) committing to developing services dedicated to veteran mental health and an annual increase in funding for these services **\[A8\].** The research informed the consultation that began this process and the subsequent action plan in 2016 **\[e.g.B1\].** Finally, our research informed the formation of the Transition, Intervention, Liaison Service \(TILS\) in 2017 **\[C\].** TILS supports military personnel through their discharge from military service and into their life as a veteran, linking the MoD, NHS and community\-based care to reduce the barriers to help\-seeking. The service supports specific stages of the veteran experience: transitioning towards being discharged from service, at which stage support is co\-ordinated with the MoD; **i**ntervention by NHS complex treatment services for those found to need them at pre\-discharge assessment, and **l**iaison within community\-based care, for long term support specifically designed for veterans without complex treatment needs **\[e.g. D\].** King’s research **\(2\)** has also enabled focus on a specific area of concern – the increased rate of violent offending in those exposed to combat, and the suggested key targets for intervention – mental health and substance misuse. 

#  King’s research has informed Government policy on the health of service families. 

 In 2019 the Secretary of State for Defence asked Andrew Selous MP to conduct an independent review to consider the diverse needs of service families, assess whether the current support offer is meeting these needs, and make recommendations accordingly, resulting in the Living in Our Shoes report **\[E1, E2\]**. King’s research **\(e.g. 5\)** underpins Chapter 6 of this report and its Recommendation 74 to promote better mental health and wellbeing for the whole family. 

#  King’s research has enabled evidence\-based decisions across diverse policy areas. 

 King’s work on post\-deployment mental health screening **\(6\)** shaped the UK’s decision to not implement this intervention on the basis that it was not effective **\[A2\]**.  Also, our research **\(7\)** finding that PTSD rates were no higher in deployed female military personnel informed the Ministry of Defence policy decision to lift the ban on women in Ground Close Combat roles in 2016 **\[F1, A2\]**. This research also informed the preparation of the minor additional support services needed to support the potential elevation in help\-seeking from women.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Back pain accounts for 10% of all years lived with disability.  Our ‘risk stratification’ approach for back pain \(STarT Back\), and its implementation \(IMPaCT Back\) has led to fundamental changes to policy and patient care nationally and internationally. NICE recommends use of the approach, which links risk of persistent disability \(low, medium, high\) with matched treatments. Public Health England determined that STarT Back has a Return on Investment \(ROI\) of up to £226.23 for every pound spent, with estimated annual societal savings of £46 million. STarT Back was selected by Universities UK in the top 100 key UK innovations \(2018\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The biopsychosocial model for low back pain has long been recognised, but evidence of how to incorporate this into clinical practice was lacking. As a result, guidelines did not include recommendations relating to management of psychosocial aspects of back pain. We produced ground\-breaking research in 2011, published in the Lancet, which demonstrated that stratified primary care management, nested in a biopsychosocial framework, led to significant improvements in clinical outcomes, improvements in health\-related quality\-of\-life, cost savings from reduced health\-care use, and fewer back pain\-related days\-off\-work \[3.1\]. 

 In order to examine whether trial\-based findings were applicable to real\-life clinical practice, we conducted the IMPaCT Back study to test implementation of the STarT Back approach \[3.2\]. 922 patients from 64 GPs and linked physiotherapy services were followed\-up; 368 identified prior to stratified care implementation, and 554 following implementation. Findings corroborated those from the STarT Back trial, demonstrating that time\-off\-work halved, and 30% fewer patients received sickness certification. Economic evaluation indicated that the approach led to cost savings of £34 per patient coupled to an improved quality of life, plus savings from reduced work absence \(£400 per employed patient\) \[3.3\]. 

 To maximise the benefits of the STarT Back approach, a substantial shift in General Practitioner and Physiotherapy clinical behaviour was required. To understand these perspectives, qualitative research gave vital insights into GP \[3.4\] and physiotherapists’ \[3.5\] views of adopting the STarT Back approach. Interviews with thirty\-two GPs revealed low levels of interest in low back pain, and a potential lack of engagement with a new treatment approach. This highlighted the support that would be needed for working practices to enhance continued use of the approach outside of trial settings. Thirty\-two interviews were conducted with physiotherapists to elicit views of implementing change \[3.5\]. These revealed the conditions and consequences of change that would aid translation into other settings and highlighted perceived benefits to clinicians and patients. In moving to a new approach, issues such as willingness to change, perceived benefits, and the process of adjustment must be considered. 

 To examine the longer\-term economic benefits of the STarT Back approach, beyond the usual 1\-year follow\-up, statistical modelling of data from the clinical trial and implementation study was carried out \[3.6\]. This study demonstrated long\-term cost\-effectiveness of the approach, delivering 0.14 additional quality\-adjusted life years \(QALYs\) at a cost\-saving of £135.19 per patient over a ten\-year period. The work showed that the predicted cost\-savings and improvements in quality of life were likely, even if healthcare costs were different to the original study, giving further evidence of the generalisability of the findings, and identified that the greatest benefits and cost\-savings could be found in high\-risk patients.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 STarT Back is recommended by NICE and Public Health England. The Return on Investment \(ROI\) for society is up to £226.23 for every £1 spent, with \~£46 million saved annually. In the past 6 years STarT Back has fundamentally changed policy and patient management nationally and internationally. It has improved quality of life for patients and helped return\-to\-work. Through its implementation, clinicians now have an evidence\-based approach to guide care, supported by bespoke online training \(Stevenson\). 

 **Transforming Health Care Policy** 

 Policy makers, guideline developers, health purchasers, and public bodies have adopted STarT Back in national and international clinical guidelines \(5.1\-5.3\). For example, for the first time NICE back pain guidance \(2016\) recommended STarT Back, leading to a steady increase in uptake in primary care \(2014\-2018\) \(5.1\). Public Health England used health economics analysis in their ROI report \(5.4\) to support their recommendation for STarT Back throughout England. The report suggested that for every £1 spent on STarT Back, £226.23 is saved at a societal level \(5.4\). Report findings were used to support transformation of UK Musculoskeletal and Back Pain Pathways \(5.5\-5.7\). 

 **Transforming Services** 

 Services have been redesigned to maximise benefits across the UK and internationally. Following the recent introduction of STarT Back in New Zealand, 21% of surveyed physiotherapists are using the approach \(5.8\). Across primary care 45% of general practices \(specifically AURUM practices \- 7 million patients registered at EMIS Web® 2018\) had used STarT Back \(2014\-2018\) \(5.1\). In the West Midlands through the Academic Health Science Network, 15 Clinical Commissioning Groups and 15 Provider Trusts have been engaged in implementing STarT Back, with 2378 patients benefiting \(5.7\). In East Staffordshire, 226 patients had significant health improvements when using STarT Back \(5.9\).  A NICE Shared Learning Case \(5.10\) demonstrated greater patient satisfaction and quicker appointments when services were reorganised using STarT Back. In Gloucestershire \(5.11\), “ *patients received significantly more treatment sessions as the risk\-rating increased, in line with the anticipated impact of targeted treatment pathways. Physiotherapists were largely positive about using the model. The potential annual impact of rolling out the model across Gloucestershire is a gain in approximately 30 QALYs, a reduction in productivity losses valued at £1.4 million and almost no change to NHS costs*.” 

 **Support for Industry** 

 In 2018 STarT Back research was identified in the top 100 impacts \(5.12\) by Universities UK. If used in half the patients in England, estimated annual savings equate to £46 million. To increase use by GPs in Primary Care, we have developed and implemented successful electronic STarT Back reminders with industry partners \(e.g. 5.1\) \(EMIS Health, TPP, SystemOne\). A large NHS Trust in the West Midlands mandated use of the STarT Back reminder system, and analysis of >4000 patient interactions \(EMIS\) indicated that the tool was completed in 87% of cases. Connect Health took an innovative approach to introduce STarT Back into large commercial Occupational Health settings from 2018, to assist employee return\-to\-work. 

 **Support for Clinicians** 

 We have changed what clinicians do for patients with back pain. We have trained over 300 national and international physiotherapists to deliver STarT Back \(e.g. 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.11\). We recently developed online training to support uptake; the website received 17,328 visits on launch day. Currently, 1,499 users have registered for and used STarT Back Online Training, 1,128 attempted the final quiz with 685 successful completions. Overall, the STarT Back website has received 236,407 visits, and the training/resources page 23,021 visits \(data extracted 31.12.2020\). \(5.9\) The approach is included in the Royal College of General Practitioners \(RCGP\)/Versus Arthritis Curriculum \(5.9\) \(Care of People with Musculoskeletal Problems, 2016\)  [https://startback.hfac.keele.ac.uk/clinicians/](https://startback.hfac.keele.ac.uk/clinicians/) and four RCGP modules. To assist international clinicians, the STarT Back tool has been translated into 40 languages; our translation webpage had 1,402 visits and online calculator accessed 14,684 \(31.12.2020\) \(5.9\). Our website and online survey show the tool is being used in Europe, Africa, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Ireland, Hong Kong and North America \(5.9\). 

 **Support for Patient information** 

 We have changed the way information for patients with low back pain is created and shared. Keele’s LINK Group \(Lay Involvement in Knowledge Mobilisation\) co\-produced an evidence\-based patient leaflet \(5.9\). Underpinned by STarT Back research, this has been endorsed by NICE \(E208\); received a British Medical Association Commendation Award; been shared with colleagues in Australia, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand and downloaded 9,679 times \(extracted 24.9.2020\). Our innovative STarT Back animation has had over 1,800 Twitter views and 4,126 on YouTube. Patients are enhancing implementation across in Staffordshire as key members of a Community of Practice to embed STarT Back. 

 In summary, STarT Back implementation has fundamentally changed policy and patient management nationally and internationally, with substantial cost effectiveness and returns on investment.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 By employing relatable and familiar topics such as cartoon animation, space travel and superheroes, we have engaged, informed and inspired children and adults with mathematics. 

 Since 2014, mathematics researchers have run interactive workshops and presented talks at the annual Lancashire Science Festival, which has had over 65,000 visitors to date and focuses on familes from disadvanged backgrounds. Over 1,000 people have attended maths\-based public engagement lectures at LSF and beyond, presenting mathematical research in an accessible and entertaining manner.  A transdisciplinary popular science book, *Unmasked: The Science of Superheroes*, has been authored, applying mathematical theories to the concepts of change of size, time travel and super speeds as seen in the exploits of cinematic block\-busting superheroes. Through STFC funding and in collaboration with the Reading Agency, over 5200 copies of the book have been delivered to libraries in the UK to optimise access and to get children interested in STEM subjects through reading.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Jeremiah Horrocks Institute \(JHI\) at the University of Central Lancashire brings together researchers from across mathematics, physics and astronomy. Within the JHI the Mathematics Research Group’s expertise lies principally in Model Theory, Algebra, Functional Analysis, and Acoustics. Here, the work of Anscombe and Bowman are highlighted. 

 **Anscombe’s** research features a mix of number theory and logic, concerning fields, especially those of positive characteristic, valued fields, and various notions of dimension and measure that arise in the study of measurable and generalised measurable structures. 

 Fields are mathematical structures which include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, all obeying the usual laws of arithmetic. Fields of positive characteristic \(akin to modular arithmetic\) suffer from the unhelpful phenomenon of inseparability, which causes a breakdown in the Galois\-theoretic link between field extensions and groups of symmetries. This, in turn, creates challenges in the study of the theories of such fields. Developing techniques to overcome these challenges is the focus of some of Anscombe's work, especially \[1\], \[2\], and \[3\], and it may loosely be described as the study of arithmetic. 

 **Bowman’s** research focuses on Lie algebras, deepening the understanding and classification of finite Lie algebras over a field by analysing the nature of chains of subalgebras \[4\].  Lie algebras are mathematical structures developed to understand and classify Lie groups, which, in turn, describe symmetries of geometric objects.  The subalgebras are subsets of an original algebra with the same structures and this activity is akin to understanding a whole mathematical object by repeatedly breaking it in to self\-similar components and observing how the process unfolds. 

 Both Anscombe’s and Bowman’s research help us understand further mathematical structures from their behaviours and by classifying their properties. These lessons have been taken forward into breaking down often difficult to understand mathematical concepts into simpler, more recognisable applications for a lay audience. 

 The themes developed from her work on model theory, and its applications in number theory and algebra, have underpinned and inspired Anscombe’s work on the book *Unmasked: The Science of Superheroes*.  Likewise, Bowman’s expertise as a science communicator has also enabled him to contribute extensively to engaging the public with the research of the Mathematics Research Group and wider STEM research from across the University.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Mathematics Research Group \(MRG\) primarily through Anscombe and Bowman have helped to inform a wide range of public engagement \(PE\) activities aimed at improving levels of awareness of, and engagement with, mathematics. These targeted activities were undertaken as part of wider multidisciplinary ventures across associated STEM \(science, technology, engineering as well as mathematics\) subjects, part of a strategic decision to work alongside university colleagues in the Jeremiah Horrocks Institute and beyond to maximise PE opportunities both regionally and nationally. The two main approaches are outlined below. 

 <ins> **Inspiring</ins> <ins>young people</ins> <ins>from disadvantaged backgrounds**</ins> 

 The Lancashire Science Festival \(LSF\) has been run by the University of Central Lancashire since 2011, and from 2014, MRG researchers have annually contributed to public lectures and interactive hands\-on stalls. The festival is a free event and aims to make STEM and Higher Education more accessible to a variety of audiences, with particular focus on primary\-age children and their families, often from disadvantaged backgrounds. 

 There are high levels of deprivation across Preston and the North West; according to the English Indices of Deprivation 2019, approximately 18% of the city’s population live in the most deprived 10% of local authority areas in the country. Since 2014, 65,055 people have attended the Festival \[A1\], and an audience analysis conducted by the UK Science Festival Network in 2017 and 2018 showed that attendees with limited budgets or living in rented accommodation were overrepresented at the LSF when compared to national averages \[D\].  Low socioeconomic status, such as those seen in Preston and the surrounding region, has an established link with poor educational attainment. Research on the LSF found that 70% of parents attending the Festival reported a positive impact on their perception of STEM with this proportion increasing among parents from more deprived areas \[B\]. The MRG plays an important role in the festival offering and we would highlight the following two activities: 

 <ins> *Experiment Packs*</ins> 

 As part of the 2019 Festival activites, Anscombe contributed to an ‘Experiment Pack’ which was available for free to children from disadvantaged backgrounds who attended the festival with their schools or their families.  Informed by her research, Anscombe developed a series of engaging logic puzzles suitable for primary school children.  In total, 755 packs were sent to nineteen schools in the surrounding region.  Positive feedback from teachers noted that the packs would **“Allow the parents to see what they can do \[to\] support their child's learning”** and **“Inspire them and show them how accessible science is to do at home”** \[E\]. 

 <ins> *Rocket to the Moon*</ins> 

 As part of a series of celebratory events centred around the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Moon landings, Bowman developed and delivered ‘Rocket to the Moon’, a PE cinematic experience which broke down the mathematical challenges faced and solved in the effort to land humans on the moon. The political, economic, ground breaking engineering and hitherto unexplored scientific challenges faced by the Apollo missions all involved the solving of related mathematical problems. 

 Presented at the Lancashire Science Festival as well as at the Harris Museum, Preston, and World Museum, Liverpool, the events were attended by over 500 members of the public, ranging from primary school children experiencing the story for the first time to adults reliving their memories of the momentous occasion \[C1\].  The event was praised for how it engaged members of the public with the mathematical science involved, with many commenting how inspiring and informative the talk was.  One, initially reluctant, attendee commented **“I will confess that I was almost dragged there, like a reluctant teenager, with just the promise of lunch afterwards as a way to keep me looking forward. I have to say that within seconds you had me hooked. From the warm up screen presence of the TV and film related space characters to you finishing to both canned and in\-house cheering I was intrigued and I learned so much.”** Another attendee praised the use of mathematics to provide context: **“I liked the maths calculations to explain things more in context, even though I am not a Maths person.”**\[C2\] 

 <ins> **Engaging</ins> <ins>audiences</ins> <ins>with</ins> <ins>Mathematics</ins> <ins>through thrills,</ins> <ins>movies</ins> <ins>and superheroes**</ins> 

 From the perspective of a lay audience, mathematics and other related science subjects are intimidating topics that are often difficult to grasp. However, placing them in the context of something more familiar and relatable can break down pre\-conceived barriers and anxieties to learning, enhancing the appreciation of how vital yet enjoyable mathematics can be. 

 In this context, Bowman regularly delivers popular maths\-focused talks at festivals and public venues designed to engage the younger audience members. His session ‘Maths, Disney and Pixar’ and subsequent sequels showed the audience how mathematics plays an integral role in the design and production of our most beloved animated characters. Other related sessions target how maths is employed in the construction of rollercoasters and in robotic design. Using these appealing themes, Bowman introduced attendees not just to the basic mathematics of gravity and speed but also those of shapes integral to the creation of thrill rides as well as use in animation techniques. Over 700 people attended the public talks in 2018 and 2019, with 90% of feedback respondents praising the presentations and its application of mathematics in an unusal yet accessible manner \[A2\].  The feedback for these events has highlighted the successes that have been achieved in engaging with audiences.  One attendee commented on Twitter **“Dr. Kevin Bowman Maths, Disney and Pixar lecture \-best I've ever seen.”** \[A3\] 



 In a similar fashion, Anscombe was part of a transdisciplinary project that built on the surging popularity of the superhero genre. *Unmasked: The Science of Superheroes* is a popular science book \(ISBN 978\-1912979080\) authored by seven UCLan researchers to explore the scientific realities behind famous comic book legends and blockbusting movie icons. Launched on World Book Day in February 2020, the book draws on Mathematics alongside Computing, Engineering, Physics, Biology and Psychology to examine how real\-world research can be just as wondrous and intriguing as the explosive events presented on our cinema screens. As part of the project, each of the authors were spectacularly turned into superheroes themselves across the pages of the book, with each character reflecting different types of superpowers and their scientific basis. Anscombe played a central role in the project team including writing a book chapter on “Superhero Mathematics”. As of end of 2020, 191 books had been sold online via the usual booksellers with a rating of 4.7/5 on Amazon \[H1, H2\]. 

 During 2020, a series of schools outreach events was planned to coincide with the publication in addition to an extensive engagement programme at science, literary and comic festivals across the UK. This included author talks with demos, reading sessions, panel discussions and interactive stands; however, the COVID\-19 pandemic halted all this activity. Instead the authors sought other possible avenues for engagement. In particular, the Science and Technology Facilities Council Public Engagement Team saw the opportunity for a unique approach to interdisciplinary outreach provided by the book and the UCLan team; so much so that STFC invested almost GBP23,000 in the printing of 12,000 copies to be used for their national activites.\[G\] 

 Unforunately once again, the rolling national lockdowns prevented any STFC school and science centre engagements from taking place. However, it was possible \(i\) to create an “Unmasked Science” website \[H3\] containing national curriculum lesson plans on elements from each book chapter as well as some online games \(”Density Matters” and “Super Maths” respectively for mathematics\); and \(ii\) in conjunction with the Reading Agency, distribute approximately 5,200 copies of the book to libraries right across the UK. 

 Debbie Hicks, Creative Director at The Reading Agency, commented, **“Research and experience show that children learn by incorporating reading into play. Developing science knowledge through superheroes is a brilliant way to get children interested and engaged in STEM subjects. We know children and families will love unmasking the astounding world of science and superheroes by borrowing the book from their local library.""** \[G\] Similarly, Carol Stump, Chief Librarian at Kirklees Council and President of Libraries Connected, stated: "" **The book will definitely engage children with STEM, using superheroes and the comic book legends to explore and understand science. A brilliant concept and way of getting children interested in STEM subjects through reading**\!"" \[G\] 

 The team also worked with the STFC on sending copies of the book to a number of targeted groups or organisations. In particular, Anscombe led on the engagement with STEAM Packs, a small local charity based in Kent. Knowing from their own experience that life in hospital can sometimes be “boring, painful and a little scary”, STEAM Packs create and distribute educational science, technology, engineering, art and maths packs to chronically sick children in hospital. As well as planning the production of additional mathematical puzzle sheets for these packs, in late November 2020 over 600 books were sent to specialist play teams in Darent Valley Hospital, Kent and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Middlesex as well as three specialist children’s cancer wards with support from the Chartwell Children’s Cancer Trust \(Croydon University Hospital; Kings College Hospital, London; Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich\). The books, which were given to both paediatric patients and their siblings, helped the children feel **“…valued and cared for”** and gave the staff **“…a positive boost”** \[F\]. 

 Also in collaboration with the Public Engagement Team at the STFC Daresbury Laboratory in Warrington, 100 books were received by the specialist play team at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital. Hayley Thomas, Head of Corporate Fundraising at Alder Hey Children's Charity, commented: "" **Thank you for generously donating the Unmasked: The Science of Superheroes books for our patients. Our Play Team was delighted to receive them. New books are a great way to entertain patients during their hospital stay so your donation is really appreciated**.""\[I\] 

  

 Follow\-up contacts with all the aforementioned organisations will take place from early 2021 onwards. 

 <ins> **Effect of COVID\-19**</ins> 

 Due to the COVID\-19 restrictions a considerable number of impact activities have been adversely affected. The 2020 Lancashire Science Festival and a wide range of associated regional school engagement activities were cancelled; hence no PE maths lectures have taken place. In particular, the launch of the “ *Unmasked: the Science of Superheroes”* book just four weeks before the first lockdown resulted in a loss of critical time and severely inhibited the plans for promotion of the book in schools. Major events where the book had been due to be promoted were cancelled including for example, the Northern Young Adult Literary Festival and the Blue Dot Festival, Manchester. Although in collaboration with STFC and the Reading Agency, copies of the book have reached the vast majority of libraries across the UK, all in\-library activites \(eg. author readings, science clubs\) cannot be undertaken. Visits to support the STEM activity in children’s wards was just not possible. Combined, this had a significant impact on the uptake and engagement possible for the use of the superhero book.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 From 2003\-2020, **Pollard** \(OBE DSc FREng\), **Jude** and, latterly, **Smith** have been funded by the US Water Research Foundation, five water utility consortia, EPSRC, NERC and ESRC to address the growing need for formalised risk management in the international water sector.  Since 2014 Cranfield’s work has fundamentally changed the way risk is viewed and managed within the sector. With a new network of risk managers, utilities in the UK \(e.g., Yorkshire Water\), the US \(e.g., Philadelphia Water\), Portugal \(EPAL\) and Canada \(e.g., Calgary Water\), have transformed their fragmented risk capabilities into cogent corporate entities: 

-  allowing them to create new business value from good risk governance through enhanced regulatory relationships and reduced business losses; and 

-  making them more resilient as utilities. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Water utilities must supply safe, wholesome, and affordable drinking water that consumers can trust.  In doing so, they manage a myriad of risks *preventatively*, because contaminated drinking water cannot be ‘recalled’ once supplied.  In 2003, the international water sector accepted an over\-reliance on compliance monitoring, in isolation, as an inadequate defence against waterborne disease.  The International Water Association issued the “ *Bonn Charter for Safe Drinking Water*”, a commitment to preventative risk management.  In parallel, the complexity of business risks being faced by utility managers became more widely recognised.  The sector needed to refresh its capabilities in risk management, with a more proactive approach to safer drinking water to inform asset management, corporate decisions on risk and long\-term capital plans.  In short, the water safety agenda and the need to manage business risks better, converged; with the ensuing requirement to adopt risk management as a formalised business process. 

 Drawing on Cranfield’s expertise in engineering and environmental risk analysis, Pollard, Jude, and Smith researched operational \(day\-to\-day\), tactical \(risks across business functions\) and strategic \(corporate\) risks with a new network of water utility partners.  Their research established the trajectory for change, using evidence\-informed industry guidance and case studies of value to public and private utilities of various populations served.  In contrast to other high reliability sectors \(e.g., aviation, defence\), the water sector was dominantly asset\-centric and analytic in its approach to risk, with a poor understanding of root\-cause failure, human factors, the essential characteristics of high reliability organisations and the temporal dynamics of risk.  Using critical reviews, in\-company studies and semi\-structured interviews, the research sought to remedy these deficiencies and: 

1.  for the first time, benchmarked a suite of utilities’ **risk management capabilities** \[R1\], using a maturity tool developed by Cranfield \(2007\) to propose improvements to risk management in the sector; 

1.  it produced an authoritative **critique of risk tools**, their application and the engineering and business decisions they were being used to inform \(2006\-7\) 

1.  it highlighted the **understated influence of human reliability and inter\-agency** <ins>relationships</ins> as key contributors to water safety and risk management cultures in the sector \(2009\) \[R2\] & \[R3\]; 

1.  it developed a novel fusion of **risk ‘heat maps’ with horizon\-scanning methods** \[R4\], & \[R5\], projecting temporal changes to a set of strategic risks to inform long term ‘master plans’ and discussions on utility resilience \(2014\-2015\) in the face of increased extrinsic risk \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The key impacts emerged within the census period from 2014 onwards, as risk managers in the sector began deploying the guidance from this research with their Executive bodies and Boards. 

#####  Background 

 The risk manager network created by the Cranfield team early on \(2003 to 2006\), and the practical guidance on the machinery of risk management \(2006 to 2013\) led to higher quality engagements; it cemented collaboration on risk between utility executives, Boards and regulators; and it improved their associated corporate planning processes.  Impacts below emerged within the census period from a rich system of knowledge exchange between the Cranfield team and 25 international risk managers that would not have otherwise exchanged their expertise. 

 **Creating business value from good risk governance, 2014 to 2016**<ins>.</ins>  \( **Political impact**\) 

 The long\-term research aim has been to underpin the successful deployment of risk management within the sector, create business value and shape thinking on utility resilience; critical because extrinsic threats \(cyber\-attack, climate change, access to external investment; pandemics\) have become more prominent \[R6\].  Over 150 individuals from over 60 utilities and their stakeholders from 10 countries \(UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Portugal and others\) have participated in the network, indicating the global reach achieved \(network attendance and funding stated in US Water Research Foundation report frontispieces \[S10\]. By 2014 onwards, the combined findings \[S1\] were sufficiently impactful for Pollard to chair sector\-facing dissemination workshops in Calgary and Philadelphia \[S2\] and to address \[S3\] the opening session of the 2015 International Water and Climate Forum, the biennial meeting of utility managers in North America. 

 The risk and futures methodology \[R4\] & \[R5\] is embedded within EPAL’s \(Empresa Portuguesa das Aguas Livres\) terms of reference for its revised Master Plan, which will include investments to EPAL’s water supply system.  A number of significant capital investments were informed by the methodology for EPAL, most notably, duplication of the 18km ‘Castelo do Bode’ trunk main for Lisbon, an investment of *ca.* EUR 30M, included in the current capital investment plan.  An options appraisal evaluated four alternatives and risk/opportunity/performance comparisons were made.  The option selected was the most expensive, but considered of greatest long\-term value, given the higher levels of resilience and long\-run benefits for this option under projected climate change conditions *\(Administrador Executivo do Conselho de Administração, Águas do Tejo Atlântico\)* \[S8a&b\]. 

 Following this, Pollard and Jude led a risk governance pilot study for Philadelphia Water, seconding Chalker \(Cranfield research assistant\) to support the utility’s in\-house team \[R7\] & \[S9\].  Visibility of the research led to Pollard supporting Canada’s first standard \(CAN/UL2984\) on managing public risk \[S4a&b\] and a request to produce a 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of his primer on risk for water professionals \[S5\].  Pollard has since communicated the programme’s findings to the National Infrastructure Commission at Royal Academy of Engineering and through the Academy’s Engineering Policy Centre. 

 It is challenging to quantify the *avoidance* of harm and loss from risks managed well.  However, testimonials from the UK, US and Portugal underline the reach and contribution of this research towards formalising risk management within the sector \[S6\]\-\[S9\]. Yorkshire Water commented on the transformation of their risk management capability as a result of their engagement with the research: 

 *“*We had a very dispersed, disconnected enterprise risk management system in Yorkshire Water back in 2009 to 2010 that was assessed at a basic level of maturity on all the Cranfield maturity models.  Since that point, I have implemented a wide\-ranging transformation of the company\-wide risk management system of internal control, and taken the maturity up to a mature and, in some areas, advanced state.  This has been based upon the fundamental maturity models provided out of the Water Research Foundation research, the basics of risk management and implementing concepts such as Bow Tie Analysis, PESTLE and source pathway receptor tools and techniques for risk identification and management.” 

 “Yorkshire Water has also benefited through being able to reference with our regulators OFWAT and the EA that we have been researching. Why does this benefit?  Well, the team at Cranfield are recognised internationally and nationally in the UK as a centre of expertise in risk and resilience, so this connection provides assurance to our regulators that we take our licence obligations and the need to follow leading practise seriously *.”* \(Risk and Compliance Manager, Yorkshire Water\) \[S7\]. 

 In Portugal, EPAL, with their newly\-formed team built a risk\-informed approach \[R4\] & \[R5\] to capital planning.  A former Cranfield PhD recipient, promoted to Director given her leadership on risk, commented that through association with this research: 

  

 “EPAL assumed the leadership in risk management in the water sector in Portugal, having been disseminating this knowledge not only within the sector but also across sectors.  Internationally, and apart from sharing our experience and knowledge in congresses and seminars, EPAL is now working with the World Bank helping other utilities to become “utilities of the future”, where risk management plays an important role *”* \(Administrador Executivo do Conselho de Administração, Águas do Tejo Atlântico\) \[S8a&b\]. 

 **Towards organisational resilience, 2016\-2020.**  \( **Political impact**\) 

 Cranfield and its sustained network of risk managers continues to secure funding on the practical actions that utilities can take to govern risk better and secure resilience in the face of increased extrinsic threat.  In 2017, Smith and Jude were funded by the US Water Research Foundation to  [develop a prioritised research agenda on resilience](https://www.waterrf.org/research/projects/resilient-water-infrastructure-improving-understanding-and-assessing-needs) to guide future funding priorities.  The most pressing need remains in organisational resilience \[S6\].  Several workshop attendees were members of the US Water Utility Climate Alliance \(WUCA\) and Smith has supplied further case studies on resilience in strategic infrastructure planning for WUCA guidance and training materials. 

 In a follow\-on 2018 workshop, hosted by EPAL and chaired by Jude, 15 members of the network began drafting their own resilience case studies for forthcoming Foundation guidance by Cranfield in response to calls for better resilience from regulators and the US Effective Utility Management Review Steering Group \(2016\).  Philadelphia Water Department \(PWD\) have found this engagement especially rewarding: 

 *“*The work with Cranfield University has been, absolutely, instrumental to PWD's internal thinking on risk management and documentation.  As the water and wastewater industries in the USA move forward, there will no doubt arise an increased interest in risk governance concepts and tools.  This is already evident in the American Water Works Association's Standard G410\-18, Business Practices for Operations and Management \(2018\) wherein aspects of risk governance are provided.  Also, this year \(2020\) large water utilities in the USA must complete Risk and Resilience Assessments to comply with America's Water Infrastructure Act.  The background education provided by Cranfield University in risk governance helped PWD's engineers understand the risk concepts applied by the assessment *”* \(Director, Bureau of Laboratory Services, Philadelphia Water Department\) \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Landscape fires are an increasing problem in many areas worldwide. On average, an area as large as India is burned every year. Whilst some fires are seen as an ecological necessity, others put lives, homes and infrastructure at risk, lead to ecological damage, and release smoke whose particulate matter greatly degrades air quality and leads to hundreds of thousands of early deaths annually in fire\-affected regions – mostly in developing nations. King’s research on Fire Radiative Power \(FRP\) has enabled space agencies to adjust and develop satellites and instruments to better measure fires worldwide. This has greatly improved scientists’ capacity to monitor, map and quantify the nature, trajectory and impact of wildfire activity and other forms of landscape burning in real\-time and at a global scale. As a result, fire response agencies, landscape managers, public utilities and citizens across the globe are provided with improved information and situational awareness to support decision\-making. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Landscape fires perturb a greater area over a wider variety of biomes than any other natural disturbance agent. Moreover, it has been estimated that hundreds of thousands of people around the world die an early death each year as a result of air quality reductions coming from landscape fires. However, the large\-scale, sporadic and highly dynamic nature of fires makes their identification and quantification difficult. 

 Taking leading roles within the Natural Environment Research Council’s National Centre for Earth Observation \(NCEO\), King’s researchers have contributed to significant advances in monitoring the changing state of our planet through use of satellite instrumentation. King’s research underpins a number of Active Fire Radiative Power \(FRP\) products which measure the emitted heat signal of active fires to provide information in real\-time as a fire is burning. This enables satellite data to be converted to actionable information, capable in some cases of supporting real\-time monitoring, decision\-making and early warning systems, including for air quality forecasting. 

 King’s research has: 

 **\(i\) Linked FRP to biomass burning and emissions.** Based on numerous small\-scale experimental fires conducted in a combustion chamber, King’s researchers and their collaborators were the first group worldwide to show that the FRP released by burning vegetation fires can be related directly to vegetation fire fuel consumption and the emission rate of trace gases and particulates released in the smoke \[1\]. 

 **\(ii\) Delivered FRP products for satellites to better detect fires.** King’s research has improved detection of FRP from both geostationary and orbiting satellites. The King’s team were the first to deliver the former capability, which is advantageous because of the far higher observation frequency of these systems, while the latter have a higher spatial resolution. 

 Based on assessment of FRP, King’s researchers developed a new approach to estimate biomass burning rates from **Europe’s geostationary Meteosat Second Generation series of satellites** \[2\]. This was able to detect and quantify fires in near\-real\-time close to 100 times per day, an advantage over existing methods which estimated fire emissions based on the observed burned area – a method which only works after a fire has happened and has relatively low temporal resolution. Compared with the latter approach, the FRP method was also able to detect much smaller fires without increasing the number of false detections. Based on the algorithms developed in \[2\], King’s researchers also developed a new algorithm to detect and characterise active fires within the imaging footprint of **the US Geostationary Operational Environmental satellites \(GOES\)** \[3\], thus ensuring geostationary FRP coverage of the entire Western hemisphere. Results were validated against the active fire data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer \(MODIS\) onboard NASA’s orbiting Terra and Aqua satellites which, between them, view the entire earth every day \[3,4\]. 

 King’s researchers developed algorithms to detect actively\-burning fires and retrieve FRP from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer \(SLSTR\), a new Earth Observation instrument launched on the **EU’s orbiting Sentinel\-3 satellites** in 2016 and 2018 \[5\]. King’s research made use of the SLSTR’s measurements in the visible and infrared spectral regions to identify the location and quantify the radiative power of any hotspot present on the land or ocean that radiates a heating signal within a pixel size of 1km<sup>2</sup>. All threatening hotspots comprising more than 0.01 to 0.1% of a pixel, e.g. agricultural burning, wildfires, deforestation, tropical peatland fires, industrial gas flares, and volcanoes, are identified and characterised within three hours of the SLSTR observation \[5\]. In common with the Meteosat and GOES systems, the SLSTR uses a two\-part approach to identify active fire pixels; first using a set of relatively basic tests to detect potential active fire pixels and then testing each of these pixels against more demanding criteria to confirm \(or reject\) them as a true fire pixel \[5\]. Available both in near\-real\-time, and in archive format using an even more sophisticated algorithm, the SLSTR active fire product built on King’s algorithms and testing and now available from the European Space Agency supports both operational applications \(e.g. atmospheric monitoring and forecasting\) and earth system science \(e.g. assessment of the contribution of biomass burning to the carbon cycle\). 

 **\(iii\) Enabled use of FRP to assess air quality.** King’s researchers were the first to research and publish an approach to relate the emission rates of health\-impacting particulates directly to the FRP measures derived from the continuous observations of fires provided by geostationary satellites \[6\]. Using the case study of a 2007 ‘mega\-fire’ event in the Peloponnese region of Greece, King’s researchers and collaborators demonstrated that models based on geostationary FRP data were highly effective in capturing the sub\-daily variability in smoke plume parameters that benefitted air quality forecasting \[4\]. They were thus the first to demonstrate the value of these geostationary fire emissions data for the particulate matter/aerosol optical\-depth forecasts produced by the EU’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service \[4\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 With wildfires posing an increasing threat to both our climate and human life, agencies around the world have come to understand the societal importance of having good information about the occurrence and scale of burning. Carried out in close collaboration with satellite developers around the world, King’s research enabling improved assessment of Fire Radiative Power \(FRP\) has had major impacts on the specification and design of space\-based instruments. This, in turn, has enhanced the capacity of international operational agencies to use satellite data to map, quantify and monitor global wildfires in near\-real\-time for better wildfire management and response. 

#  A. Influencing the specification and design of space\-based instruments 

 The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites \(EUMETSAT\) is an intergovernmental organisation of 30 member states established to maintain and exploit European operational meteorological satellite systems. EUMETSAT is responsible for the commissioning and operation of these satellites and for delivering the satellite data and derived products to end\-users. King’s researchers have worked closely with EUMETSAT’s Land Surface Analysis Satellite Application Facility \(LSA SAF\) which is responsible for developing and implementing algorithms that allow operational use of data from EUMETSAT’s second generation Meteosat satellites. According to Dr Isobel Trigo, the LSA SAF Project Manager, King’s research has had a “very significant, indeed vital, impact on the fire products issued by the LSA SAF” \[A\]. This includes the ‘FRP\-Pixel’ product, based on \[2\] and \[4\], which records information on the location, timing and FRP output of landscape fires detected in almost real\-time across much of the Earth \[B\]. King’s research \[4\] has further informed the design and development of the new third generation Meteosat satellite, by specifying the saturation temperature of its Middle Infrared band which will enable it to better detect smaller \(lower\-temperature\) fires while still capturing larger fire events \[A\]. This satellite is currently in the test stages and due to be launched in 2022. 

 Furthermore, King’s researchers have been part of the Sentinel\-3 Mission Performance Team of the European Space Agency \(ESA\). Here, their fundamental research \[5\] and recommendations have had significant impact on the specifications of the SLSTR instrument onboard Europe’s Sentinel\-3 satellites, which detect and quantify the FRP of fires burning across the entire earth \[C\]. Based on \[5\], King’s researchers were also responsible for designing the algorithm that continually processes SLSTR data at ESA and is used to provide the final publicly available fire information. Dr Steffen Dransfeld, the ESA Sentinel\-3 Optical Data Quality Manager, explains that the algorithm description and prototype software developed by King’s researchers was “used by ESA and its contractors to develop the fully operational software which now runs 24/7 in the Sentinel\-3 Instrument Processing Facility and which processes the ‘raw’ data collected by SLSTR into global information on active fire location and FRP…. Without this code the satellite would not provide any information useful for this fire application \[FRP\]” \[C\]. 

 Working with the Canadian Forest Service, King’s researchers have also influenced the development of WildFireSat, the world’s first dedicated and operational wildfire monitoring satellite. Dr Joshua Johnston, Forest Fire Research Scientist at the Canadian Forest Service, explains that the Mission Requirements Document \[D\], “upon which the mission is being designed, has been overwhelmingly influenced by \[King’s\] research” \[E\]. Specifically, the WildFireSat spectral band requirements were influenced by King’s work on detection and characterisation \[2,3,5\], while several of the fire products developed by King’s \[2,5,6\] supported the overall viability of satellite wildfire monitoring for emergency management \[E\]. Uniquely, WildFireSat has been designed specifically to monitor wildfires, with the intention of delivering near\-real\-time tactical intelligence to emergency responders. Given the high costs of wildfires to the economy in terms of smoke\-based health impacts, economic shutdowns, evacuations, and the cost of suppression, Dr Johnston reports that WildFireSat is expected to “save our economy about CAD5.2 billion over its 5\-year mission life” \[E\]. 

#  B. Facilitating operational use of satellite fire data 

 The significance of King’s research in making high resolution fire data available in a more timely and easily accessible fashion is illustrated by operational use of the data to detect fire risk, monitor wildfire activity and enable air quality warning systems. 

#  \(i\) Creating fire risk detection products 

 Dr Isobel Trigo, the LSA SAF Project Manager highlighted that “the geostationary FRP products are vital inputs into the LSA SAF Fire Risk product, which for Southern Europe and North Africa provides an index of fire risk based on combined use of meteorological observations, weather forecast model outputs and remote sensing data. This Fire Risk product is used currently by agencies across southern Europe, including the Portuguese National Civil Protection Authority, to forewarn of periods and locations experiencing conditions of extreme landscape vulnerability to fire” \[A\]. 

#  \(ii\) Improving fire monitoring and response operations 

 King’s research has been pivotal to the development of the Canadian Forest Service’s monitoring of wildfires. In Canada, wildfires burn on average 17,000km<sup>2</sup> of forest annually, impacting humans through both poor air quality and damage to infrastructure. Taking appropriate action used to be difficult as the official active fire products produced by the GOES\-16 satellite operated by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \(NOAA\) were considered “unusable operationally due to the extreme numbers of false positives \(i.e. false alarms that are not real fires\)” \[E\]. However, by writing geostationary active fire algorithms that were applied to the GOES\-16 satellite data stream, King’s research \[2,3\] led to a “dramatic improvement” in the quality of fire detections \[E\]. As noted by Dr Johnston, Forest Fire Research Scientist, “your innovative approach to the GOES\-16 algorithm has unlocked the use of this state\-of\-the\-art system for scientific and emergency management in Canada” \[E\]. The GOES\-16 satellite now delivers real\-time data for use in the Consolidated Fire Detection and Monitoring System of the Canadian Forest Service, providing rapid response fire locations for fire management and fire response services \[E\]. Critically, the higher\-quality data obtained by applying the King’s algorithms also allows monitoring of wildfire activity throughout the burn period at lower latitudes where most citizens live \[E\]. 

#  \(iii\) Enabling early warning systems for poor air quality 

 Fully operational since 2015, the EU’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service \(CAMS\) provides the public and decision\-makers with global monitoring of atmospheric composition as well as detailed air quality forecasts \[C\]. To do this, CAMS operates a Global Fire Assimilation System \(GFAS\), the development of which is now led by King’s researchers \[F,H\]. Built on the FRP approach and its relationship to fuel consumption and fire emissions \[1\], GFAS provides an estimate of smoke emissions from all satellite\-detected wildfires burning around the planet \[C,F\]. Dr Mark Parrington, Senior Scientist at CAMS explains that GFAS is key to enabling users to integrate hourly \(rather than daily\) information about fire emissions into air quality early warning systems, a critical feature given that fires show strong diurnal cycles with emissions varying significantly over the day \[H\]. 

 By 2019, CAMS GFAS data had 956 global users, with 369 from non\-research entities, who were using GFAS outputs directly to bring fire emissions into their own air quality early warning systems \[H\]. One significant user is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \(ASEAN\) Specialised Meteorological Centre \(ASMC\), who provide monitoring and early warning of smoke pollution coming from peat, forest and agricultural burning across Southeast Asia to the ten ASEAN nation states \[H\]. Dr Parrington explains that, “by having early warning of forthcoming poor air quality, the nations are able to take action to try to minimise the exposure of their populations to the severe air pollution that can result from the fires, for example closing schools, delaying or stopping sporting events, and arranging flights at airports so they do not operate in very low visibility conditions” \[H\]. 

 The CAMS global and European forecasts now reach, directly or indirectly, a global audience of hundreds of millions of people. For example, leading news media such as Euronews and CNN International, and apps such as windy.com \(with more than 3,500,000 unique users worldwide since June 2019 \[G\]\), use CAMS data to provide the public with air quality information, enabling those with pre\-existing health conditions such as asthma to take precautionary actions at times of forecast poor air quality \[H\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Child witnesses with and without autism are not always deemed reliable witnesses. This research evaluated interventions to support them to give reliable evidence. The research showed that: 1\) for typically developing children Registered Intermediaries \(RIs\) led to greater witness reliability, and 2\) autistic child witnesses can perform equivalently to typically developing child witnesses. The impact of the research is: 1\) an increase in requests for RIs to support vulnerable witnesses when giving evidence and more training places for RIs in England and Wales, and 2\) greater police awareness of the abilities of children with autism to be reliable witnesses. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Crown Prosecution statistics showed that in 2008/9 48,000 children were called to court. Children can give reliable eyewitness evidence but many need additional support to maximise the amount of accurate evidence provided in court.  This research evaluated interventions to support child witnesses to give a greater amount of accurate evidence. Further, autistic children often have more communication problems than typically developing children and, due to their greater vulnerability, are more likely to come into contact with the Criminal Justice System. Consequently, this research included a sample of children with autism. 

 The research was funded by an ESRC grant 2013\-2016 awarded to Professor Henry, Dr Wilcock and Dr Crane at London South Bank University. In February 2015, Dr Wilcock moved to the University of Winchester to which her portion of the funding was transferred. 

 The research examined how child witnesses aged 6 to 11 years, \(71 autistic, 201 typically developing children, all with IQs over 69\) performed during a ‘mock’ criminal investigation.  After seeing a staged crime event involving two perpetrators, children underwent an initial recall to simulate police taking a statement, one week later they received a detailed evidence gathering interview followed by two identification lineups. At interview the children were assigned to one of four conditions: a\) *Best Practice Police Interview* based on current Achieving Best Evidence guidelines used in England and Wales, b\) *Registered Intermediary \(RI\)*, typically a speech and language therapist who facilitates communication between witnesses and Justice System Practitioners, c\) *Verbal Labels*, additional verbal prompts to help memory, d\) *Mental Reinstatement of Context Sketch Plan*, a drawing technique encouraging witnesses to think about the time of the crime which aids memory. The two lineups were run in accordance with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act Code D used in England and Wales. Children who received RI assistance at interview were also supported by a RI during the lineups. 

 In an initial statement, autistic children recalled significantly fewer correct items of information but they were no less accurate than typically developing children \(3.1\). 

 One week later, at interview, for typically developing children the assistance of a RI led to a near doubling of correct information remembered compared to the best practice interview conditions but the same beneficial effect was not seen for children with autism \(3.2\).  Autistic and typically developing children showed comparable performance in the other three interview conditions. 

 At lineup, for typically developing children, the assistance of a RI led to more correct perpetrator identifications compared to best practice lineups and there was some evidence that RI assistance led to more correct rejections of perpetrator absent lineups \(3.3\). Autistic children performed comparably on three out of four lineups with typically developing children \(3.4\). 

 Key messages evidenced by the underpinning research were: 

 1\) Registered Intermediaries are very beneficial for typically developing children at interview and lineup. 

 2\) Children with autism can perform equivalently to typically developing children at interview and lineup. They are also no less accurate at initial statement taking.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has impacted Police, RIs, Barristers and Judges, who have used the findings to enhance their professional practice, and bodies such as the National Autistic Society and Witnesses and Victims of Crime. 

 **Police:* As part of the ESRC grant, Seminars on Autism and Policing and the role of RIs were held at City, University of London in 2015, 2016 and 2019. Altogether 410 Metropolitan Police staff attended and 316 completed evaluations immediately after the seminars \(5.1\).  Prior to the events most delegates rated their knowledge/awareness of RIs and how to interview a witness with Autism as fairly limited/not well prepared.  After the events, the majority rated their knowledge as fairly extensive/much better prepared. One delegate reported: *Knowledge of autism will help if I have a case with autistic victims or suspects. Knowing what an intermediary can do is invaluable and I would definitely use this in the future.*  230 of 313 respondents said they would be likely/very likely to use their new knowledge in their professional role \(5.1\).  Ten months after the 2019 seminar, 35 of the 56 police delegates who agreed to be contacted responded to a questionnaire \(5.2\). During this ten month period seven police delegates had interviewed an individual with autism and one had requested a RI.  All the officers we spoke to in follow up phone calls stated they had used the information they had learnt \(5.2\). 

 In April 2019 the Centre for Forensic and Investigative Psychology at the University of Winchester hosted a Vulnerable Witnesses Professional Development Conference.  There were 45 delegates \(from 6 different police constabularies in England and Wales, and other organisations including the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, Victim Support, Citizen’s Advice Witness Service, Rail Accident Investigation Branch, Ministry of Defence\) and 35 completed evaluations. 29 delegates reported their knowledge/awareness of RI’s had increased and 23 delegates reported their knowledge/awareness of autistic child witnesses had increased.  15 delegates reported their organisations would make increased use of RIs. 14 delegates reported their organisations could make changes to autism training/practice. Subsequently, a follow up phone call with a senior representative of the National Video Identification Parade Electronic Recording \(VIPER\) bureau, confirmed that they had communicated the impact of RIs across senior stakeholders within the UK police identification community. 

 The importance of training police in supporting autistic witnesses was acknowledged in the Autism Awareness Bill introduced by Ann Clwyd MP in May 2019 where she called for mandatory autism training for all police officers. We were in contact with Ms Clwyd’s researcher with our research papers and details of police training events. 

 The National Autistic Society guidelines \- Autism: A guide for police officers and staff \(5.3\), which Henry, Wilcock and Crane contributed to, as a result of the research, was added to the College of Policing’s Authorised Professional Practice on mental health. In 2020 we worked with the National Police Autism Association to better understand police use of the NAS guidelines. Twelve forces responded to our questions, 11 reported their force was aware of the guidelines and seven confirmed they referred to the guidelines as part of their training. 

 **Registered Intermediaries \(RIs\):** Henry, Wilcock and Crane contributed to Intermediaries for Justice \(IfJ\) conferences in 2017 \(oral paper of 3.2\) and 2018 \(poster presentations of 3.2 and 3.3\).  A senior representative of IfJ \(5.4\) noted the number of requests for RIs had increased as had the number of RIs being trained; both, in part, as a result of 3.2 and 3.3. A registered intermediary confirmed that these same papers are also included on the reading list for the mandatory RI training \(5.5\). Corroborating the suggestion of the IfJ Chair that the number of requests for RIs had increased in part due to 3.2 and 3.3, the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) responsible for managing RIs also reported that the number of requests for RIs assisting in cases involving children increased from 3,683 in 2015 to 4,635 in 2019 \(5.6\).  The Victims’ Crime Commissioner’s review of provision of RIs for children and vulnerable victims and witnesses \(5.7\) called for more provision of RIs. 3.2 is cited in this report. Furthermore, the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology’s note on improving witness testimony \(5.8\) cites 3.3 to argue that obtaining eyewitness evidence from vulnerable witnesses may not be possible without RIs. Wilcock is named in the acknowledgements of 5.8. 

 **Barristers and Judges:** The research team worked with judges, barristers, police officers and RIs to write a new toolkit entitled ‘Witnesses and Defendants with Autism: Memory and Sensory Issues’ \(2015 \- toolkit 3\). The team also contributed to a revision of the toolkit ‘Planning to Question Someone with an Autism Spectrum Disorder, including Asperger Syndrome’ \(2016 \- toolkit 15\). Both toolkits \(5.9\) are available to all legal professionals.  Downloads of toolkit 3 April 2015 to March 2018: 902. Downloads of toolkit 15 December 2016 to March 2017: 1,810. 

 **National Autistic Society:** The NAS guidelines \- Autism: A guide for police officers and staff has been promoted by the College of Policing \(5.3\). Wilcock is a named contributor with ESRC support for her time acknowledged. The Guidelines received 4,631 page views April 2017 to February 2019 and 406 downloads from June to October 2019. 

 **Witnesses and Victims of Crime:** A National Vulnerable Witness Advisor \(5.10\) suggests that papers 3.1 – 3.4 have had an impact on vulnerable witnesses and victims of crime \(children with and without Autism\) by helping to ensure they are supported to give evidence within the CJS. The research \(3.2\) has informed the forthcoming edition of *Achieving Best Evidence in Criminal Proceedings: Guidance on Interviewing Victims and Witnesses, and Guidance on using Special Measures* \(soon to be published by the Ministry of Justice\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In 2018, there were 2,917 deaths related to drug misuse in England and Wales, the highest number registered since records began in 1993. The problem is particularly acute in Wales where greater levels of deprivation have contributed to a rate of deaths far higher than in England. Between 2009 and 2020, USW researchers conducted a series of interlinked empirical projects that have helped to minimise drug and alcohol\-related harm and save lives. The findings have directly influenced the commissioning and delivery of substance\-misuse services in Wales including, the national roll\-out of the Take\-Home Naloxone Scheme across Wales \(naloxone is a drug that reverses a heroin overdose\) and important changes to long\-standing harm\-reduction advice. The research has also helped services to prepare drinkers for the potential unintended negative consequences of Minimum Pricing for Alcohol. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This case study is underpinned by a series of inter\-linked projects conducted by University of South Wales \(USW\) researchers between 2009 and 2020. The projects are linked in their focus on one of the most vulnerable and marginalised groups in society \- people with substance \(drug/alcohol\) use problems. A common thread running through the projects is the goal of minimising health and social harms. As drug\-related deaths soar to an all\-time high across Wales and the UK, harm reduction has never been more important. 

 **Project 1:** In 2009, USW researchers were commissioned by Welsh Government \(WG\) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Take\-Home Naloxone \(THN\) Demonstration project, which involved training opioid users in the use of naloxone and giving them take\-home kits for use in overdose situations. The evaluation employed a quasi\-experimental design and mixed\-methods approach. With fieldwork support from researchers at Glyndwr University, data were collected using questionnaires \(completed by 525 users\), observations \(of 14 training sessions\) and in\-depth interviews with eight opioid users and nine providers of substance\-misuse treatment services. The study found that users trained in the use of naloxone were able to administer it effectively in real\-life overdose events. However, sometimes a single dose was not enough to save lives. The evaluation report \(2011\) recommended that the Scheme be rolled out beyond the demonstration sites to services across Wales and that the medical arguments for double dosing be reconsidered. 

 **Project 2** aimed to shed light on the ‘dark figure’ of non\-fatal overdose \(which had been identified in Project 1\), through a national survey of injecting opioid users in Wales. The study involved USW researchers and Dr Rhian Hills \(Senior Policy Manager in WG\) distributing questionnaires to 661 consecutive users of all treatment service\-based needle and syringe programmes across Wales over a one\-month period in 2013. The questionnaire generated previously unknown data on the prevalence and characteristics of non\-fatal overdose in Wales \(e.g. the mean number of survived overdoses per person per year\). Statistical support was provided by Professor Sheila Bird \(University of Cambridge\). 

 **Project 3** \(2015\-2017\) added qualitative detail to Project 2 through in\-depth interviews, conducted by Holloway \(USW\) and Hills \(WG\), with 55 opioid users recruited from prisons and drug treatment services in Wales. The report \(2017\) identified important ways in which overdose events could be more effectively managed to save lives \(e.g. encouraging people to use ‘in sight’ of others and to routinely carry naloxone\). May \(USW\) contributed to an article published in the International Journal of Drug Policy based on these findings. 

 **Project 4** \(2018\-2019\) was commissioned by WG in response to the increasing rate of drug\-related deaths involving prescription\-only medication. This qualitative study was conducted by USW researchers and Hills, and based on interviews with 60 people with histories of illegal drug use. The research found that drug users often faced barriers to accessing treatment for both substance\-use problems and legitimate health problems. The report \(2019\) recommended the need to speed up access to treatment, to tackle stigma among healthcare professionals, and to capitalise on the helping culture of drug users to help minimise harm and save lives. 

 **Project 5** \(2018\-2019\) was commissioned by WG in response to concerns about potential unintended consequences of introducing Minimum Pricing for Alcohol \(MPA\) in Wales. This predominantly qualitative study, undertaken by researchers from USW, Glyndwr University and Figure 8 Consultancy, gathered data from service providers and service users through interviews \(n=87\) and online survey questionnaires \(n=193\). The research identified several possible harmful consequences including increases in income\-generating crime, unplanned alcohol withdrawal and substance switching. The report \(2019\) recommended dissemination of the findings to service providers across Wales, which would include statutory community\-based drug and alcohol teams in each Health Board area as well as the five major substance misuse treatment providers operating in Wales \(see  [Barod](https://barod.cymru/),  [Kaleidoscope](https://www.kaleidoscopeproject.org.uk/),  [CAIS](https://www.cais.co.uk/),  [WCADA](https://www.wcada.org/),  [Change Grow Live](https://www.changegrowlive.org/taith-cardiff-and-the-vale/cardiff)\). Subsequently, a series of dissemination events \(2019/20\) was funded by WG, which helped to raise awareness of MPA and prepare services for possible negative effects.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The number of deaths related to drug misuse in England and Wales is at a record high  [\(ONS, 2019\)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsrelatedtodrugpoisoninginenglandandwales/2018registrations). The problem is particularly acute in Wales where the rate of deaths is higher than in England. The causes are complex and include poverty and deprivation \(which are greater in Wales than England\), insufficient funding of treatment services, increases in prescription drug misuse, and an ageing cohort of vulnerable drug users. Alcohol\-related harms, including nearly 500 deaths per year and 15,000 hospital admissions, are also of concern in Wales  [\(Public Health Wales, 2019\)](https://publichealthwales.shinyapps.io/AlcoholinWales). Such harms have been linked to excessive consumption of cheap, high\-strength, high\-volume products, and led Welsh Government to implement Minimum Pricing for Alcohol in March 2020. 

 Findings from a series of interlinked projects conducted by USW researchers since 2009 have had a significant impact on substance misuse policy and practice in Wales. The research has generated new knowledge that has helped to minimise drug and alcohol\-related harm and benefited people with substance misuse problems, their families and friends, and the professionals who treat and support them. 

 **USW research led to the Welsh Government’s National roll\-out of the Take\-Home Naloxone \(THN\) Scheme and influenced the switch from single to multiple doses** 

 In the evaluation of the THN Demonstration Project \(2009\-2011\), USW researchers recommended the national roll\-out of the THN Scheme to services across Wales and urged Welsh Government to review the potential life\-saving benefits of providing more than one dose of naloxone.  Roll\-out was implemented by WG in November 2011 and the Scheme continues to operate across Wales today.  [*Drug and Alcohol Findings*](https://findings.org.uk/docs/Morgan_G_1_findings.pdf?s=eb&r=&c=&sf=fpd) *,* an online ‘Effectiveness Bank’, founded in 1999 by Alcohol Change UK and the National Addiction Centre \(with monthly reads “well over 100,000”\), asserts that the evaluation “ *found promising results <ins>leading</ins> to its roll\-out as a national programme”*. The provision of multiple doses of naloxone \(Prenoxad\) was piloted in 2015 and rolled out across Wales in 2016. By 2017\-18, 99% of THN kits were Prenoxad kits. Between 2014 and 2020, 23,667 THN kits \(including single and multiple dose formulations\) were issued to 6,096 unique people at risk of overdose. Over that same period, there were 2,702 reported uses of THN with fatalities occurring in approximately 1% of these cases  [\(Public Health Wales, 2020\)](https://phw.nhs.wales/publications/publications1/harm-reduction-database-wales-drug-related-mortality-report-2019-20/). The THN Scheme has been helping to save lives across Wales since 2009 and throughout the current REF period. 

 **Changes to harm\-reduction advice provided by Welsh Government and Public Health Wales were influenced by USW research** 

 Building on a national survey that investigated the dark figure of non\-fatal overdose, USW researchers conducted qualitative research \(2015\-17\) that identified new ways in which overdose events could be more effectively managed to save lives \(e.g. using ‘in sight’ of others\). The importance of not using or injecting out of sight of others is now widely recognised among practitioners as a critical piece of harm\-reduction advice, which sits alongside the traditional ‘do not use alone’ message. Leaflets \(S1, S2\) incorporating this message were produced by Welsh Government \(2017\) and, more recently by Public Health Wales \(2020\), for distribution to treatment services across Wales, which would include the needle and syringe programmes operating in 57 specialist statutory/voluntary organisation sites across Wales \( [Public Health Wales, 2020](http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/888/document/348244)\). The findings have featured in evidence presented by Public Health Wales to the UK Government’s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs \(27/07/20\) and the Welsh Government’s National Implementation Board for Drug Poisoning Prevention \(31/07/2020\). 

 The Head of Substance Misuse Policy and Finance, Welsh Government, confirms in a testimonial that the findings have been “ *of benefit to Welsh Government both in terms of policy and operational practice*” and have contributed to “ *ongoing work to tackle drug related deaths and of course implement our Substance Misuse Delivery Plan*” \(S3\). 

 The Head of Substance Misuse at Public Health Wales has said: “ *Based upon the findings of the 2018 qualitative study of fatal and non\-fatal overdose among opiate users in South Wales, Public Health Wales undertook to develop national messaging for use on all injecting related paraphernalia \(single injecting kit packs and sharps/safe disposal bins\) including those key harm reduction messages developed with the work of Professor Katy Holloway. These messages included ‘Stay in sight, stay alive, avoid using alone’ and ‘Carry it, use it, call for \-help – Naloxone – be the difference’.  These messages and associated graphics are being finalised by Public Health Wales will be used across Wales from January 2021. I feel confident in acknowledging that the harm reduction messaging was clearly informed by their evidence, and can confirm that this messaging and harm reduction approach has been shared with other key stakeholders via the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, the National Implementation Board for Drug Poisoning Prevention \(NIBDPP\) and European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction*” \(S4\). 

 Additionally, the Campaigns and Communications Lead at Barod, a Wales\-based charity that provides support and guidance to anyone affected by drug or alcohol use, has said: ” *Many of these recommendations* \[in Holloway’s research\] *have subsequently been put into practice, including changing the terminology of ‘do not use alone’ to ‘do not use out of sight of others’, when using substances. The change in terminology of this specific harm reduction message has been pivotal. This can be evidenced none more so, than in recent months. In light of the Covid\-19 pandemic, we have been able to adapt our advice to those undertaking high risk substance use behaviour, around this specific message. By saying ‘do not use out of sight of others’ has enabled the recipient to better understand and more realistically put this into practice, due to a wider scope of interpretation, compared to ‘do not use alone’*” \(S5\). 

 **These changes in harm reduction advice by service providers have helped to save lives** 

 An experienced Harm Reduction Worker within Gwent Drug and Alcohol Service \(GDAS\), which provides direct support and intervention for service users and their families across the Gwent region, has confirmed that the recommendations made by USW researchers, such as the change in terminology and the need for a wider provision of THN, amongst others have had a major impact. He specifically attributes the research to the following: 

-  Letters were sent out to every GP in Gwent, Wales, giving clear pathway advice in accessing Naloxone to concerned others 

-  Every hostel in NPT \[Newport\] has been provided with training to administer this intervention and have on premises at least five Naloxone packs 

-  During pandemic lockdown, 15 self\-contained living Pods for street homeless PWUD \[people who use drugs\] in a secure area called the Mission, “designated as a high risk” now interact weekly with outreach workers \(all the security are trained in the use of administering Naloxone and have prevented death by overdose in at least one incident by keeping 5 naloxone on site as harm reduction preventative measure\) 

 He also states that: “ *As an ex\-opiate dependent service user for 15 years with first\-hand experience of overdose prior to working in this field, I would testify that this research on overdose has made it easier for service providers and service users alike to communicate in a frank way without the fear of reprisals in relation to continuing treatment. Highlighting the importance of saving lives through the promotion and education of service providers and service users alike on the prevention of overdose.* 

 *In the last three years I have administered a Naloxone intervention twice in a social setting outside of working hours, where the availability of Naloxone was key in saving lives. Prior to this important research, the availability of Naloxone was scant at best. The harm reduction advice given by service providers to PWUD and concerned others around not using alone, and the escalation of Naloxone training for all service users entering OST \[opioid substitution treatment\] has been key in preventing opiate overdose*” \(S6\). 

 **USW research has influenced the Welsh Government Substance Misuse Delivery Plans and helped improve access to treatment** 

 Qualitative research investigating the misuse of prescription\-only medication among illegal drug users \(2018\-19\) found that it was common practice for people to share their prescription medication to help those facing barriers to legitimate sources of treatment \(e.g. through stigma and disbelief among healthcare professionals and/or long waiting lists for treatment\). These findings formed the basis of a  [BBC One Wales documentary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-51119636) \(25/01/20\), which within three months \(27/04/20\) had achieved more than 27,000 views on the BBC website and 4,990 impressions and 202 engagements on Twitter. Findings from the research were also shared on BBC Radio Wales \(25/02/20\) Breakfast with Oliver Hides  [\(average audience of 62,000\)](https://business.senedd.wales/documents/s63445/NJW02%20BBC%20Wales.html?CT=2). A testimonial from the Head of Substance Misuse Policy and Finance, Welsh Government, confirms that the research findings have been *“reflected in our new Substance Misuse delivery plan 2020\-22”* and *“disseminated to partners to ensure they are … taking on board the recommendations”* \(S7\). Additionally, the Head of Substance Misuse at Public Health Wales reiterates that “ *this work also informed the Welsh Government Substance Misuse Delivery Plan 2019\-22*” \(S4\). 

 **USW research helped drinkers cope with Minimum Pricing for Alcohol \(MPA\)** 

 Research investigating the potential unintended consequences of introducing MPA in Wales \(2018\-19\) highlighted a general lack of awareness of the legislation and identified widespread concern that some drinkers might engage in harmful behaviours to facilitate their continued consumption of alcohol. To help services prepare for these potential negative consequences, the findings were shared in a series of workshops held across Wales \(December 2019 to February 2020\). The events were facilitated by USW researchers and attended by 112 representatives from: third\-sector organisations, NHS, licensing, trading standards, police, and Area Planning Boards. A post\-event feedback survey, completed by 45% of attendees \(n=50\), showed significant improvements in awareness. Furthermore, nearly three\-quarters of respondents indicated that they would now ‘do something new’ to help service users cope with MPA \(S8\). The Substance Misuse Development Officer for the Huggard \(a charity set up in 1998 to provide practical help to people sleeping rough on the streets of Cardiff\) attended the workshop in December 2019 and confirmed that it had enabled him to tailor interventions with clients to support them and that “ *as a result*” an increase in unplanned, life\-threatening alcohol withdrawal was largely avoided \(S9\). On 17/02/2020 findings from the study were shared by USW researchers on  [ITV's Sharp End](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itv.com%2Fwalesprogrammes%2Fsharp-end&data=02%7C01%7Ckaty.holloway%40southwales.ac.uk%7Cca264617a3474d38956e08d7b45ddf3b%7Ce5aafe7c971b4ab7b039141ad36acec0%7C0%7C0%7C637176187579433471&sdata=20bY1Ckjhy3sWuQJVUBN7uzgy8arlIn%2FU1SqRsXWzUo%3D&reserved=0) current affairs show \( [average audience of 29,000](https://www.barb.co.uk/)\), which generated 1870 impressions and 138 engagements on Twitter.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study describes significant further impacts of the novel method that transformed exit\-polling at UK General Elections.  The context is that the underpinning research had already led to success in predicting the outcomes of the 2005 and 2010 General Elections, for broadcasters BBC, ITV and Sky.  In the period 2015 to 2019 the main additional impacts of the work were: 

-  The same method was used — unchanged, and again with great success — at three further UK General Elections \(in 2015, 2017 and 2019\), by a team working to produce exit polls for BBC, ITV and Sky for an audience of millions \(via TV, radio and the internet\). 

-  Due to the accuracy of the new method, trust in UK\-election exit polling grew substantially in the years 2015–2019, as was evident in the broadcasters' own coverage of the exit poll as well as in the wider media. A particular consequence of the increase in trust was that, at all of the three most recent elections, the 10pm close\-of\-polls movements of global financial markets were immediate and essentially complete, with major markets responding as if the 10pm exit\-poll prediction was the actual result of the election. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research was application\-specific statistical methodology, developed by Professor David Firth at the University of Warwick between October 2004 and February 2006.  The research work was carried out in preparation for the May 2005 General Election, and then continued over several months after that election with post\-election analytical work to assess the performance of the methods in detail. 

 Firth, together with Professor John Curtice of the University of Strathclyde \(Department of Government\), had been engaged by the BBC and ITV jointly to design and analyse their election\-day exit poll at the next General Election \(expected to take place in 2005 or 2006\). 

 A full account of the methodological development was published in 2008 in the jointly authored paper **\[3.1\]**, detailed below. 

 The Curtice & Firth \(2008\) paper **\[3.1\]** describes several strands of novel statistical methodology developed for use at the 2005 General Election, which would be the first time that BBC and ITV \(and their respective opinion\-polling partner companies, NOP and MORI\) were to combine resources to run an exit poll and produce a single forecast that would be broadcast by both organisations at 10pm on polling day.  The novel methods included, as the most important statistical ingredients: 

-  *Design* of the exit\-poll via a *panel* of polling stations \(drawn from those that had been used by NOP and MORI in their separate operations at the 2001 General Election\). 

-  *Modelling* of the exit\-poll data through multivariate regressions of electoral change. This included the detailed development and testing of a completely new, coherent approach to the treatment of multi\-party shares of the vote. 

-  Accurate *calibration* of constituency\-level probability forecasts through a new, non\-standard method with tuning constants determined through extensive experimentation with data from previous elections. 

 The methodological \(statistical\) research was all carried out by Firth. Curtice's role was to provide essential and detailed political and polling knowledge. 

 Firth's involvement in election\-night forecasting had begun in 1997 when he worked at the University of Oxford: at the 1997 and 2001 General Elections he served as assistant to the veteran psephologist Clive Payne, who retired as the BBC's statistical consultant on election forecasting after the 2001 election.  Early developments in some parts of the new methods of Curtice and Firth **\[3.1\]** were trialled at the 2001 election; the bulk of the research work, though, was done after Firth moved to Warwick on 1 October 2003 and was subsequently appointed by the BBC as Payne's successor to work on the 2005 election.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **The background: Exit polls at UK General Elections since 2005** 

 The major UK broadcasters fund and organise an election\-day exit poll, in order to inform their coverage \(on TV, radio and internet\) on the night of the UK General Election, a time when current\-affairs broadcasting attracts large audiences.  For the election in 2005, David Firth as consultant for BBC developed \(with John Curtice\) a completely new method **\[3.1\]** for the exit poll, to improve the accuracy of the headline prediction made at 10pm on election night.  The method proved so successful in 2005 — with an *exact* prediction of the 66\-seat Labour majority — that it was adopted jointly by all of BBC, ITV and Sky for the following election in 2010.  After a similar success in 2010, the method has been used jointly by BBC, ITV and Sky at all subsequent general elections \(2015, 2017 and 2019\).  Corroborative statement **\[5.1\]**, written after the 2010 election by the then Editor of BBC Political Research, confirms the pre\-2015 background and emphasises the importance of the new method to the broadcasters. By 2010 Firth had moved on to other projects, and he passed the operation of the exit\-poll method and associated software to Jouni Kuha \(LSE\), who replaced Firth as the statistician in John Curtice's election\-day team at every General Election from 2010 to date. 

  

 **Fresh impact in 2015–2019** 

 The impacts described below are of two main kinds: 

1.  Impact of the underpinning research in conveying **timely and accurate information to a large worldwide audience**, via conventional media \(TV, radio, press\) and the internet. While this  kind of impact was previously generated in connection with the General Election of 2010; the impact between 2015 and 2019 is around three times as big since it relates to three further elections. 

1.  Additional impact via the public track\-record of accuracy of the new exit\-poll method since 2005, in the form of **substantially increased trust** in the exit poll and the 10pm election\-night prediction that comes from it. By 2019 the 10pm exit\-poll prediction was presented \(by broadcasters and other media outlets\) without the scepticism that had routinely accompanied such predictions previously \(in 2005 and 2010 for example\); and even *politicians* now typically accept the exit\-poll prediction as a reliable indication of the election outcome.   Moreover, the world's financial markets also now exhibit essentially 100% trust in the accuracy of the exit poll \(whereas previously, even as recently as 2010, the markets' response at 10pm to a surprising but ultimately accurate exit poll was rather more muted because exit polls back then were not trusted to be accurate\). 

 The Curtice\-Firth methodology developed in the underpinning research **\[3.1\]** was used unchanged, by a team of academics working jointly for the three major broadcasters \(BBC, ITV, Sky\), to design and analyse the **exit polls for the three General Elections in 2015, 2017 and 2019**. The corroborative statement in **\[5.2\]**, written in 2020 by Professor Jouni Kuha who is the statistician in the exit\-poll team led by Sir John Curtice, fully confirms this.  Kuha states straightforwardly: ""The methodology of the exit poll in all of these years has been the one which was developed by David Firth and John Curtice for the 2005 election, as described in Curtice and Firth \(JRSSA, 2008\).""  Kuha's statement letter also comments on the remarkable accuracy of exit\-poll predictions in the five elections between 2005 and 2019, and states that ""This success would … have been impossible without the current exit poll methodology.""  The article in **\[5.2\]** by Curtice, Kuha and other exit\-poll team members, published after the 2017 election, gives a more detailed account. 

 The broadcasters \(BBC, ITV and Sky\) disseminate their exit\-poll prediction to the whole world at 10pm on election day via TV, radio and the internet.  In the UK alone, the number of BBC1 viewers at 10pm on each election night exceeds 6,000,000, according to reports **\[5.3\]** on the 2015, 2017 and 2019 elections from the BBC and Press Gazette; the corresponding number of viewers on ITV and Sky is reported to be 1–2 million.  The exit poll's global reach via the internet is not measured but is very substantial: the exit\-poll prediction is picked up immediately by news media across the world, and by global financial markets.  The background letter **\[5.1\]** indicates the high value that the BBC and other broadcasters attach to the exit poll.  According to paragraph 29 of the 2018 report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Political Polling and Digital Media \(in **\[5.3\]**\), the cost of running the exit poll at a General Election is around GBP300,000 — a figure which further corroborates the high value that the broadcasters attach to the exit poll. 

 Interest in the exit poll from the general public is strong \(as indicated by the quoted audience figures, for example\), and there is evidence that the public at large now appreciates that modern\-day \(""John Curtice""\) exit polls are much more reliable than pre\-election polls.  Evidence **\[5.4\]** collects some representative social\-media posts from members of the public in December 2019, e.g., "" *There is only one poll to trust and it's the exit poll*"".  From these social media posts, it seems also that the exit poll influences individual behaviour, for example the decision to stay up on election night: typical tweets include "" *No point \- exit poll is always right*"", "" *I didn't sleep a wink on referendum night. Wouldn't have missed it for the world. I don't bother on General Election nights though. I trust John Curtice enough to watch the exit poll and get off to bed*"" and "" *JC's exit poll is normally bang on, at 10pm tomorrow I'll know whether to go to bed early*"". 

 To support wider understanding of the exit poll and its methods, David Firth created \(in 2010\) the public\-facing ""Exit Poll Explainer"" page at  [warwick.ac.uk/exitpolling](https://warwick.ac.uk/exitpolling) — which sees thousands of visits around the time of an election \(access statistics **\[5.5\]** show more than 15,000 distinct visitors in the week of the 2017 election, for example\).  Sir David Spiegelhalter, then President of the Royal Statistical Society, highlighted the *Explainer* page along with this public comment **\[5.6\]** immediately after the 2017 election: "" *Clear outright winners of this election \(and others\): statisticians who designed the exit poll and its model*"".  In his 2019 popular book *The Art of Statistics*, Spiegelhalter even highlighted Firth's work on exit\-poll methodology as the book's final chapter "" *An Example of Good Statistical Science*"". 

 In all three of the most recent elections \(2015, 2017, 2019\) the exit poll's prediction was markedly different from what had been expected from pre\-election polls \(as indeed it had been also in 2010 and 2005\).  Whereas in 2010 the surprising exit poll was downplayed by TV broadcasters and on\-air pundits \(as noted also in **\[5.1\]**\), by 2017 its track\-record of accuracy had forced the commentators and politicians to accept the 10pm exit poll as a reliable prediction of the election outcome.  Evidence **\[5.7\]** collects some media items which show this.  Even in 2015, former LibDem leader Paddy Ashdown rubbished the exit poll in his interview on BBC1 and famously said he would eat his hat on TV if his party lost the large number of seats that the exit poll had predicted \(their actual loss was two seats *more* than the prediction\).  By 2017, though, the tone had changed markedly towards acceptance of the exit poll's accuracy.  In her BBC interview a few weeks after the 2017 election, PM Theresa May admits to having been ""shocked...devastated"" upon hearing the exit poll that signalled the loss of her House of Commons majority.  By 2019 we even see John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, conceding the election on BBC1 just 15 minutes after the 10pm exit poll has been announced.  Whereas in 2015 *The Independent* still asks "" *Just how did the exit poll manage to get it so right?*"", in 2019 *The Economist* reports simply that "" *Britain's exit poll has an exceptional record*"". 

 In the peer\-reviewed paper **\[5.8\]**, written after the 2017 election and published in one of the most prominent international journals of political science, the evidence just described is solidified through formal text\-analysis of election\-night broadcasts across UK general elections since 1955.  Paper **\[5.8\]** provides many new insights, and a key conclusion is that "" *The remarkable accuracy of the 2010 exit poll, and the subsequent success of the 2015 and 2017 exit polls, have been associated with a growing focus on them in the early part of the broadcasts.*"" 

 Evidence **\[5.9\]** collects clippings about the exit poll in relation to **financial markets**, clippings which show the markets' increased trust in the 10pm exit poll prediction. In 2017 a *CNN Money* article stated: ""The exit poll has typically been much more accurate than Britain's notoriously shoddy opinion polls"".  A 2019 pre\-election article from *Pound Sterling Live* quotes Samuel Tombs \(Chief U.K. Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics\): ""Abandon all your priors when the UK exit poll is released at 22:00 — it has a very good track record since its current methodology was introduced in 2005"".  A *Financial Times* online article published shortly before close of polls in 2019 assesses the increase in trust directly, and states: ""The exit poll's recent run of prescient results has meant that traders are putting increased stock in its predictive power, with the pound fluctuating more aggressively following the poll's release from one election to the next.""  The sequence of graphs shown below amplifies the message of that *Financial Times* article; it shows the GBP\-USD exchange rate, through election nights 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019 \(using data from *forexite.com*\).  In each panel the red line is the average price in the half\-hour *before* the 10pm close of polls, while the green line is the average for the half\-hour *after* 10pm. 





 In 2010 the 10pm fall in Sterling was only a relatively small fraction of what the currency would ultimately lose by the next morning \(even though the surprising exit poll was highly accurate\): just like the political pundits, the market did not really trust the exit poll by 2010.  As the accuracy of exit polls became more firmly established, though, the market's trust increased.  By 2017 the market's 10pm reaction to a surprising \(but ultimately accurate\) exit poll was as big as its full response to the actual result of the election the next morning. 

 John Curtice — who is by now very much the enduring public face of election polls in the UK — received a knighthood in 2018.  David Firth's underpinning technical contribution to the accuracy of modern exit polls has been recognised in public less formally, through mentions in media articles and occasional interviews for BBC TV and radio.  Ahead of the election in 2017 the BBC acknowledged David Firth's exit\-poll work through a 1\-minute feature video **\[5.10\]** which was broadcast via BBC TV news bulletins in the UK and syndicated to global media via the internet.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Warwick’s mathematical epidemiologists have played a leading role in the control of two neglected tropical diseases \(NTDs\) – *gambiense* human African trypanosomiasis \(gHAT, or sleeping sickness\) and lymphatic filariasis \(LF, or elephantiasis\). These diseases cause thousands of deaths and ruin millions more lives in some of the world’s poorest countries. Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Warwick research recommended and validated public health strategies for sleeping sickness in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Chad. These interventions have resulted in significant progress towards eliminating sleeping sickness transmission for good by protecting around 740,000 people. Warwick modelling also outlined a vital assumption in the World Health Organization’s 2017 guidelines for mass drug administration against elephantiasis. In 2019 the resulting triple\-drug or ‘IDA’ therapy was administered to 45,200,000 at\-risk people in 11 different countries – 0.6% of the world’s total population.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Neglected tropical diseases \(NTDs\) are a diverse set of around 20 illnesses that limit the life chances of over 1,000,000,000 of the world’s poorest people; in response, successive World Health Organization \(WHO\) roadmaps have set a goal to reduce by 90% the number of people requiring treatment for NTDs by 2030. Research towards the elimination, of transmission and as a public health concern respectively, has been highlighted below with reference to two NTDs: 

-  Human African trypanosomiasis \(HAT\), or sleeping sickness, is transmitted by infected tsetse flies and is usually fatal without treatment. The *gambiense* strain \(gHAT\) accounts for >95% of cases. In 2009 there were around 10,000 cases worldwide, with approximately 80% found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \(DRC\), and with most of the rest in Chad, Guinea, Central African Republic, Chad and Angola. Overall, over 51,000,000 people are at risk across 24 countries. In 2018 global, annual case reporting dropped below 1,000 for the first time. 

-  Lymphatic filariasis \(LF\), or elephantiasis, is transmitted by worms; extreme swelling of the limbs, breasts or genitals results in severe disability. There are estimated to be around 36,000,000 people at present with chronic ailments resulting from LF, with around 893,000,000 at risk of the disease in 49 countries. 

 Achieving the WHO’s ambitious target would require a coordinated response from national and international actors: donors, funders, endemic countries, disease experts, big pharma, NGOs and the research community. Mathematical epidemiologists at Warwick’s Zeeman Institute for Systems Biology and Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research \(Rock, Hollingsworth, Keeling, Dyson, Spencer and others\) have established international reputations for the combination of mathematical, health economic and epidemiological research expertise required. 

 The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \(BMGF\) and the Task Force for Global Health \(TFGH\), recognising the need for policy\-relevant mathematical modelling to support the WHO’s global strategy and local NTD elimination programmes, funded the NTD Modelling Consortium in 2015 **\[G1\]**, an international partnership of 9 relevant institutions led by Hollingsworth \(Warwick 2013\-2017; Oxford from 2018 **\[G2\]**\).  The purpose of the consortium is to provide holistic modelling support for NTD elimination, including overview studies of how best to meet elimination targets **\[3.1\]**. Additional BMGF grants at Warwick funded disease\-specific modelling projects on HAT **\[G3**, **G4\]** \(PI: Rock\) and LF **\[G5\]** \(PI: Hollingsworth\) which produced a large volume of policy\-relevant modelling research. 

 In 2015 Rock modelled the gHAT control strategy for regions in former Bandundu province of the DRC **\[3.2\]**. The Warwick model variants were the first to be fitted to longitudinal surveillance data from DRC. They estimated the impact of current control policies and projected the likelihood of meeting elimination targets. The analysis suggested additional strategies such as vector control \(e.g. killing flies using insecticide\-impregnated targets\) and/or improved screening may be required to reach elimination in specific settings. It suggested that there may be a portion of people at a high risk of acquiring infection who are not being accessed by the existing screening programme. Subsequent work by Rock **\[3.3\]** extended this analysis to cover 168 health zones comprising the entire DRC. This work estimates the median time to end of transmission \(EOT\) and the associated uncertainty for each health zone under different elimination strategies and identifies those that would most benefit from intensified public health interventions. 

 Rock and collaborators performed similar validation of gHAT measures in Chad where vector control and improved passive screening had already been introduced in the Mandoul region from 2014 **\[3.4\]**. This work quantified the effect of these interventions – concluding that approximately 63% and 9% transmission reduction came from vector control and improved passive screening respectively.  Additional work in **\[3.5\]** provides a review of the feasibility of the WHO goal of ending gHAT transmission globally by 2030 accounting for likely discrepancies between reported cases and actual infection and uncertainties stemming from variations in passive screening levels and possible animal reservoirs. 

 In 2017 **\[3.6\]** Hollingsworth and collaborators used modelling to assess the case for a change of WHO guidelines on elimination of LF. Prior to 2017, mass drug administration \(MDA\) with double drug therapy of diethylcarbamazine and albendazole \(DA\) was recommended by the WHO as the preferred approach to LF elimination in endemic areas. The efficacy of this approach was modelled in **\[3.6\]** and compared to other potential MDA strategies. It was found that in both high\- and low\-prevalence settings, the triple drug therapy, IDA \(ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole\), required fewer rounds of MDA to reach elimination compared to the DA double drug regimen, thereby offering the possibility of reaching elimination targets sooner.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The scale of the challenge linked to neglected tropical diseases \(NTDs\) remains staggering: over 1,000,000,000 people remain at risk from around 10 NTDs \(London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, 2012\), yet to date only a single human transmissible disease – smallpox – has been eradicated by public health measures. Since 2015 Warwick’s NTD modelling research has had an impact on policy formulation and implementation of gHAT elimination strategies in the DRC and Chad, two of the worst\-affected countries in the world, saving or improving the quality of an approximate 740,000 lives. In the case of LF, work at Warwick was implemented in the revised 2017 WHO guidelines, which promotes mass drug administration \(MDA\) via a triple drug regimen. This guideline has resulted in 45,200,000 people across 11 countries being treated with triple drug therapy in 2019. 

 <ins> **Impact on national governments: optimal strategies for</ins> <ins>gHAT</ins> <ins>elimination in DRC and Chad**</ins> 

 Public health interventions against gHAT have been very successful: the annual number of cases fell from 25,841 in 2000 to 6,973 in 2010, and to 864 in 2019 **\[5.1\]**. Given this impressive progress, the WHO moved from a target of elimination of gHAT as a public health problem by 2020 to a target of elimination of transmission by 2030 **\[5.1\]**. 

 Because transmission is not directly observable from case and screening data, it must be inferred by combining this data with an appropriate model **\[3.2\-3.4\]**. Since 2015, Rock has worked directly with the responsible public health agencies in Uganda, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, DRC and Chad to allow them to quantitatively gauge the impact of existing interventions on gHAT transmission. Of note, productive partnerships began in 2015 with the respective health ministries’ Programme National de Lutte contre la Trypanosomiase Humaine Africaine \(PNLTHA\) in DRC and Chad, two of the countries worst\-affected by gHAT. 

 <ins>DRC:</ins> PNLTHA is a specialised programme set up in the early 1990s to organise public health approaches to the disease control throughout the country. Its integrated approach includes active screening and treatment; vector control \(reduction of human\-tsetse fly contact\); and epidemiologic surveillance, training and communication at community level. 

 The University of Warwick’s modelling examined what combination of medical interventions \(active and passive screening, as well as vector control\) in the DRC would be required to meet elimination of transmission by 2030 in 168 health zones \(each with an average population of 100,000\) **\[3.3, 5.2\]**. The findings revealed six new priority health zones where large\-scale vector control would be needed \(Bagata, Bandundu, Bolobo, Kikongo, Kwamouth and Masi Manimba in former Bandundu province\), in addition to continuing existing vector control in the Yasa Bonga health zone, in order to meet the elimination of transmission target. This contributed to PNLTHA’s policy review in 2018 and the decision to implement scaled\-up vector control between 2019 and 2022 **\[5.2\]**. These 7 health zones have some of the highest levels of gHAT in the world **\[5.2\]**, with an approximate total at\-risk population of 700,000. 

 Vector control interventions for gHAT use ‘Tiny Target’ technology – a small \(50x25cm\), low cost \(<$1\), eco\-friendly insecticide\-impregnated panel of blue cloth that attracts tsetse and is planted using stakes near a body of water. In 2014 there were no such large\-scale interventions in DRC, however numbers of Tiny Targets were intensified to their highest ever levels in 2020 in accordance with Warwick’s modelling, with 43,000 deployments made per year spanning an area of 11,700km<sup>2</sup>. Additionally, these deployments are planned to increase to 80,000 by 2022 **\[5.2\]**. The Director of PNLTHA\-DRC says: “ *The modelling results from \[Dr Rock\] and the HAT MEPP team have played a decisive role in guiding and verifying planning localised interventions against gHAT across the DRC and our confidence in achieving the elimination goal of 2030. We hope to continue this precious collaboration… and be guided by other results”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 <ins>Chad</ins>: Vector control was first implemented in 2014 in the swampy Mandoul region, which has an approximate population of 40,000, and where most gHAT cases occurred between 2000 and 2013. Adaptation of the Warwick model to Mandoul made it possible to quantify the effect of interventions \(both improved passive screening and vector control\). Modelling suggested that these combined measures led to a 72% reduction in transmission. Continuing implementation of these interventions saw cases gradually reduce from 715 in 2002 to fewer than 20 cases reported in 2018 and 2019 **\[5.3\]** 

 The Warwick modelling for Chad provided important validation that the approach in Mandoul was an optimal strategy **\[5.3\]**. The Director of PNLTHA\-Chad highlighted the significance of such verification: "" *Cost effective public health interventions are essential in all countries due to the huge demand for medical resources, which is especially important in a low\-income country like Chad.*” With regards to meeting the 2030 elimination of transmission target for gHAT, the findings demonstrated it was "" *essential to continue interventions every year in order to lead our country on the path of elimination*"" **\[5.3\]**. 

 <ins>Continued BMGF funding:</ins> In a 2018 review meeting, ‘Progress and Plans for Elimination and Eradication Programs for HAT and Guinea Worm’, Rock met with Bill Gates and his team to present and discuss the HAT modelling work **\[5.1\]**. In 2020 Rock secured further grant funding, ‘Modelling for the HAT Endgame’ **\[G4\]**, with BMGF stating this was to “ *assist in finding the most efficient strategy to success""* for gHAT elimination, in the context of the WHO 2030 elimination target **\[5.1\]**. 

 <ins> **Impact on international organisations: revised WHO guidelines on LF elimination**</ins> 

 On the basis of her high\-profile modelling work through the NTD Consortium **\[3.1\]**, in January 2017 Hollingsworth joined a guideline development group convened by WHO to re\-examine its guidelines pertaining to LF elimination. Prior to 2017, mass drug administration \(MDA\) with double drug therapy of diethylcarbamazine and albendazole \(DA\) was recommended by the WHO as the preferred approach to LF elimination in endemic areas. In 2017, this group produced revised guidelines **\[5.4\]** that incorporated Hollingsworth’s findings in recommending a switch to the ‘IDA’ triple drug therapy \(ivermectin, trade name Mectizan, with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole\). Warwick modelling allowed for the quantification of the number of annual triple therapy rounds required to meet elimination targets **\[3.6\]**, an assumption that is fundamental in evaluating treatment cost and hence the overall viability of the proposed regimen. 

 In response to the new WHO guidelines, the global pharmaceutical giant Merck Sharp & Dohme committed to donating an additional 100 million Mectizan \(ivermectin\) treatments annually up to 2025 to support the elimination of LF by triple\-drug therapy **\[5.5\]**. In 2019, 201,000,000 treatments for LF were approved by Merck's Mectizan Donation Program \(MDP\), allowing the triple drug IDA programme to extend its coverage into 13 new countries and territories: American Samoa, Egypt, Fiji, Guyana, India, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Sao Tome & Principe, Timor Leste and Tuvalu **\[5.5\]**. In MDP’s 2019 Annual Highlights, Program Director Dr Yao Sodahlon writes in his message: “ *As of December 2019, the number of people no longer needing treatment with Mectizan and albendazole for elimination of LF as a public health problem increased to 163.3 million \[163,300,000\], from 150.9 million \[150,900,000\] the previous year… We will continue working \[with our partners\] to sustain high Mectizan treatment coverage and ensure that no one is left behind – regardless of who they are and where they live*” **\[5.6\]**. 

 In October 2020 WHO revealed that in 2019 45,200,000 people were treated with the triple\-drug IDA regiment across 11 countries based on the revised guidelines **\[5.7\]**. This represents around 6 in every 1,000 people \(based on the world’s total population of 7.7 billion in 2019\).

 The history of Belfast is often seen, over\-simplistically, as one of sectarian conflict and deep division. Olwen Purdue’s work has challenged this perception and changed the way people think about Belfast and its past, engaging local and international audiences in an alternative, more nuanced, social history of a remarkable city at the height of its industrial might, and of the shared experience of those who lived and worked in it.  Her work has informed the interpretation of Belfast’s history by major cultural and heritage institutions. It has also reached millions of people in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and globally through television, museum exhibitions, internationally\-acclaimed visitor experiences and a community engagement project.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In a body of work spanning thirteen years, Olwen Purdue has shed an important new light on the social history of nineteenth and early twentieth\-century Belfast and its rural hinterland, providing the first detailed examination of issues such as poverty, welfare, power and agency generally overlooked in historical accounts of the region. 

 From 2007, Purdue was employed on the ESRC\-funded project, ‘Welfare Regimes under the Irish Poor Law 1850\-1921’ in which she developed new research into poverty and welfare in the north of Ireland. Her work provided the first scholarly exploration of the ways in which the poor and working classes of nineteenth\-century Ulster experienced and engaged with welfare provision in the form of the workhouse. **\(1\)** 

 Her growing body of work and expertise in the social history of Belfast and its hinterland led to a research commission from two companies \(CHL Consulting and Event Communications\) which were contracted by Titanic Foundation and Belfast City Council to develop the content of the highly\-acclaimed visitor experience, ‘Titanic Belfast’, which opened in 2012. Purdue was commissioned as academic adviser for this venture, her research and expertise shaping the content of the attraction’s opening gallery which highlights working conditions in Edwardian Belfast and outlines the social and economic context within which the *Titanic* was built.  While working on this commission, Purdue drew on themes she was identifying to edit a collection of essays on the social history of the industrial city, *Belfast: the emerging city 1850\-1914.* **\(2\)** 

 This work also led to a major AHRC\-funded project \(with Prof. Peter Gray\), ‘Welfare and Public Health in Belfast and its Hinterland 1800\-1972’. Purdue’s work focused on the period 1850\-1939 and provided the first in\-depth exploration of the challenges of poverty and engagement with welfare systems experienced by many of Belfast’s labouring classes, particularly women and children. Sole\-authored outputs from this project included an article in *Urban History* and an invited chapter in a volume on welfare regimes in Europe **\(3 & 4\).** Her work on this led to a further commission in 2013 to provide expert historical research and advice for the Ulster Museum, part of National Museums NI. Purdue advised on the content of a new permanent gallery on the history of nineteenth\-century Belfast, ‘An industrial giant and the shadow of poverty’, and wrote and presented a talking\-head audio\-visual installation which explained this aspect of Belfast’s history. In 2017, she also produced an online documentary on poverty and welfare in the city from both historic and contemporary perspectives – ‘Belfast, a tale of two cities’. **\(5\)** 

 These themes were further developed and explored within a wider geographical context and theoretical framework in Purdue’s 2018 edited collection, *Urban spaces in nineteenth\-century Ireland,* in which her own chapter investigated the ways in which Belfast’s poor navigated and challenged the constraints of welfare provision in their use of the city’s workhouse. **\(6\)** 

 Purdue’s work has shed new light on how the poor of nineteenth and twentieth century Belfast, particularly women and their families, experienced working life in the city and faced the challenges of poverty and ill\-health, how they engaged with and experienced welfare provision, and how they exercised agency in using the limited welfare options open to them. Thus it offers alternative \- and shared \- historical narratives to the more familiar ones of sectarian division and difference, and has foregrounded for the first time the histories of groups too often overlooked in the overwhelmingly masculine historical narratives of this divided city.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Purdue has worked with a range of partners to develop new, high\-impact ways of disseminating her research on the social history of industrial Belfast, challenging the predominant narratives of sectarian conflict and encouraging a deeper understanding of Belfast’s rich, and shared, social history. The main impact of her work is outlined below. 

 **1.  Impact on public awareness and understanding** 

 Through her work with Titanic Belfast, the Ulster Museum, and television, Purdue’s research has reached millions of people locally and globally. 

 As the leading expert on the social history of nineteenth and twentieth century Belfast, Purdue was commissioned in 2011 as historical advisor for **Titanic Belfast** on the recommendation of Belfast City Council. She worked with the designers on all aspects of the attraction and was responsible for developing and signing off on all historical content. However, her distinct knowledge and expertise were particularly employed in shaping the content of Gallery One \- Boomtown Belfast \- which introduces the visitor to life in Edwardian Belfast, and outlines the social and economic context in which *RMS Titanic* was built \(A\). 

 The visitor attraction opened in March 2012, and has had a significant impact since then.  By August 2019 more than **5.7 million** people had visited Titanic Belfast **\(4.9 million in the period 2013\-2020\)**; the majority \(80%\) from overseas \(B\). As each visitor follows a pre\-set route, commencing with Purdue’s ‘Boomtown Belfast’ gallery, every visitor experiences this gallery. 

 Survey evidence indicates that visitors learn a great deal from the content of Boomtown Belfast. A visitor survey carried out by Queen’s University researchers in 2019 \( *n*=419\), found that nearly all \(99%\) respondents reported having gained new knowledge from Boomtown Belfast. Two\-thirds \(66%\) said they had discovered more about the linen industry in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, while 62% said they had learned more about the ship\-building industry. Most respondents \(95%\) were tourists; among their comments were the following: “Very informative. \[I\] learned a lot about Belfast. I never would have guessed Belfast had this industry.” and “It made me aware of the rich history of Belfast and the importance of the shipping industry.” \(C\). 

 Purdue’s expertise in Belfast’s social history led to her being invited in October 2013 to become an academic advisor to the **Ulster Museum**, working with the museum in the development of an entirely new permanent gallery on the social and economic history of Belfast – ‘Industrial Giant and the Shadow of Poverty’. This used the museum’s collections to explain the industrial growth of Belfast and to engage audiences in exploring the social conditions of the time. 

 The Ulster Museum has attracted **hundreds of thousands of visitors annually** \(623,272 in 2018\-19\) with 30% of visitors coming from outside Northern Ireland, of which half have been from overseas.\(D\)  A 2015 review article concludes that the new galleries, of which Purdue’s was one, provided ‘a more nuanced approach to the interpretation of history – one forged from an interest in bringing new layers of understanding. This encourages us to think about the lives of children, women and disabled people, and creates a link between the stories of Northern Ireland and the international experience’. \(E\) 

 A visitor survey carried out by Queen’s University researchers in 2019 \( *n =115\)* focused on responses to the ‘Industrial Giant and Shadow of Poverty’ gallery. 83% of respondents said the gallery ‘improved my knowledge and understanding of nineteenth\-century Belfast’, while 52% said they now understood more about poverty in Belfast. Comments included: “The depth of information provided allowed me to make connections through history I otherwise would not have known.” \(tourist\). “I didn’t know of the strong presence of the linen industry in Belfast” \(tourist\) \(C\) 

 It is, however, through the expert advice based on her original research that Purdue has provided for **TV documentaries** that her work has reached its widest audiences. As a result of her expertise Purdue was commissioned as historical advisor and expert interviewee for a number of different programmes with a combined audience of several million.  These included: *Britain’s Hidden Heritage* \(BBC1, 2015\) \(approx. 4.25 million viewers\); *Britain’s Most Historic Towns \(Channel 4, 2018\)* and BBC NI’s 3\-part series *Family Footsteps* \(2018\). \(F\). 

 In 2018, Purdue’s work reached millions of viewers through her commission as credited historic expert and interviewee for the Channel 4 documentary, *Belfast, Britain’s most Victorian City* \(2018\).\(G\) Each episode reached an average of **1.5 million** viewers on its first airing, placing the series at Channel 4’s third highest\-viewed in that prime\-time slot over the past three years. The series has since been repeated in the UK and distributed worldwide. \(H\) 

 The beneficial learning impact of Purdue’s TV work is illustrated by the result of an online viewer survey conducted by Queen’s University researchers shortly after the two relevant episodes of *Family Footsteps* aired \( *n*=65\). More than half \(55%\) of respondents said they had gained a greater insight into life in nineteenth\-century Ulster as a result of the programme. Nearly half \(49%\) said they had a better understanding of the region’s social history, while 42% said they would like to find out more about that social history.\(C\) 

 **2. Making a major contribution to Belfast’s visitor offering and the work of cultural institutions** 

 Purdue’s research has made a vital contribution to the work of major cultural institutions and visitor experiences, enhancing their content and shaping how they engage public audiences. This has enriched the experience of those who visit them and has helped to enhance Belfast’s reputation as a tourist destination. 

 Titanic Belfast was declared the World’s Leading Visitor Attraction in the 2016 World Travel Awards, organised by the World Travel and Tourism Council \(I\). Purdue’s work has been considered pivotal to that success. Belfast City Council’s Heritage Officer stated that Purdue made ‘a particularly valuable contribution’ to the work of Titanic Belfast ‘both in terms of process and by bringing high level, specific knowledge of the social context of the period in question’. ‘A large part of the reason why the project exceeded expectations so comprehensively’, he added, ‘is the quality and authenticity of the content, firmly based on a foundation of research, to which Dr Purdue was a key and vital contributor \(I\) 

 Her research has also enhanced the Ulster Museum’s offering by contributing new social and economic historical content which provides a more nuanced, complex and diverse narrative of Ireland’s past than was previously available and has helped contextualise subsequent galleries dealing with the recent conflict in Northern Ireland. NMNI’s Head of Collections has observed that its collaboration with Dr Purdue was ‘highly productive and impactful’ and ‘enabled us to locate contested history within a broad social, human centred context’.\(J\) 

 Finally, her work as historical adviser for the Channel 4 series *Britain’s Most Historic Towns* was described by the series’ production company, IWC Media, as ‘crucial … highlight\[ing\] the most relevant areas of Victorian influence over the city, whilst ensuring that the script for the episode is historically and factually accurate’.\(K\) 

 **3. Engaging hard\-to\-reach local audiences in exploring a shared history** 

 Purdue also sought to engage local hard\-to\-reach audiences, mainly young people, in the history of their city through the project **‘Our Stories, 1932’**.  Purdue drew on her research into the city’s social history to work with Greenshoot Productions in developing a series of research workshops and activities for young people from north and east Belfast in which they researched work, life and poverty in their area during the 1930s. These groups presented their findings to an audience which included two playwrights – Martin Lynch and Gary Mitchell \- who incorporated this material into a stage play, *1932: The People of Gallagher Street.* The play ran in The MAC Theatre, to full audiences \(2\-13 November 2017, total audience: **2,253**\), helping to raise public awareness of social conditions in Belfast 

 A follow\-up audience survey, carried out by Greenshoot Productions, \( *n*=111\) found that almost all respondents \(96%\) left the play wanting to know more about this period in Belfast’s history. 77% of respondents learned something as a result of watching the play, and just under two\-thirds \(58%\) stated that the play changed the way they thought about social conditions or community relations in the 1930s. \(L\)

###  1. Summary of the impact: 

 Trickett’s research directly influenced how the police respond to hate crime on local and national levels. Specifically, the research has transformed the design, content and implementation of national and local hate crime training for policing staff; informed the development and adaptation of Police Risk Assessment tools in Nottingham and the East Midlands region; extended the level of protection under the law to victims of hate crime. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Hate crime has been historically under\-reported or under\-prosecuted, with the task of identifying such offences complicated by the fact that perpetrators may be friends, carers or acquaintances of victims who exploit these relationships for financial gain or some other criminal purpose. Against this backdrop, the CPS and police have been keen to discover more around the nature of offending and its impacts among concerned communities. In 2014, Trickett was commissioned by the South Nottinghamshire Community Safety Partnership to evaluate CPS Disability Hate Crime Cases across the East Midlands. Her research identified significant gaps in knowledge resulting in poor responses and incorrect labelling of disability hate crime which greatly influenced the efficacy of prosecutions. This empirical evidence provided localised insights into a national picture of victim dissatisfaction with criminal justice responses particularly those concerning victims with learning disabilities \( **R1**\). 

 Subsequently, Trickett undertook an empirical study exploring the experiences of police officers in dealing with hate crime. The report, *The Policing of Hate Crime in Nottinghamshire* \( **R2**\), found that the existing ‘tick box’ design of the online training materials was not fit for purpose. It was noted that this training format was out of line with existing educational pedagogies on adult learning and also failed to account for key aspects of police culture and the existing literature on how police officers learn. Significant deficits were also found in the knowledge officers had around hate crime issues. Recommendations were provided which improved the delivery of hate crime training and to which led to the redesign of risk assessment tools in 2016 \(see Section 4\). 

 In 2018, Trickett undertook a follow\-up study to explore how the 2016 recommendations had been implemented \( **R3**\). The report concluded that officers found existing procedures to be overly cumbersome and recommendations included the need for a streamlined risk assessment focused on factual questions with gradient responses linked to levels of procedure/response, and which afforded space for officers’ discretion. It was further suggested that this user\-friendly form of risk assessment should be adopted by all police forces as a national standardised model. 

 One particular limb of Trickett’s research focuses on violent hate crime directed against women and girls. In 2018, Trickett was commissioned by the Nottingham Women’s Centre and the Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner to undertake an evaluation of the policy \( **R4**\). The research found that women in Nottingham felt that they were specifically targeted for harassment and abuse on the basis of their gendered identity. The report recommended that ‘gender’ should be included as an additional legal category of hate crime, recorded as such by all police forces on a national level. Police training should also be recalibrated to reflect the intersectional nature of harassment, and to encourage empathy and sympathy with women so that they feel they are being taken seriously.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 \(1\) **Shaping police training** 

 As a direct result of Trickett’s research, the National College of Policing developed new training for front\-line police and call\-handlers on identifying, recording and responding to reports of hate crime \( **S1**, **S2**, **S5**\). The new electronic training platform now includes videos of experts, victims, support providers and others who have had direct experience of hate crime and its effects. The platform was piloted in Hampshire in 2018, and is now being rolled out nationally. The College of Policing stated that **R1** ‘helped us to address a significant gap in our knowledge’ and ‘has been instructive in the development of our on\-line learning for frontline police and call handlers on identifying, recording and initially responding to hate crime reports’ \( **S1**\). One platform designer commented that use of the videos ‘were very well received during the pilot stage of the online learning development. These design points were also integrated into online learning for police in Italy and Hungary’ \( **S2**\). 

 Similarly, at local level, Trickett’s research led to Nottinghamshire police overhauling their existing model of hate crime training, replacing a restrictive ‘tick box’ approach with face\-to\-face workshops using quotes and videos with victims of hate crime to humanise their experiences \( **S3**, **S5**\). The research continues to be ‘invaluable in ensuring any training we design is appropriate and answers police officers’ needs’ \( **S4**\). 

 \(2\) **Revision of risk assessment tools** 

 As a result of the research Nottinghamshire Police revised their risk assessment process \( **S5**\), replacing the three risk categories \(‘Low/Middle/High’\) with a simplified ‘Low/Raised’ classification to enable a wider range of hate incidents to be captured and avoid artificial inflation of risk. The new tool was commended by HMICFRS, citing ‘the design and balance of questions about the offence and diagnostic questions to determine risk’ and ‘the alignment of procedure with risk categories as specific guidance for police officers in keeping victims safe’ as exemplars of best practice \( **S6**\). Trickett’s further recommendations concerning the need for streamlined questions with gradient responses were subsequently incorporated into the latest version of the tool in June 2019 \( **S4**, **S5**\). The research has also effected change at national level, with other forces including North Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Avon & Somerset, Surrey and Dyfed\-Powys adopting the tool \( **S3**, **S7**\). 

 \(3\) **Improving the legal response to misogyny** 

 Trickett’s research has triggered a national debate, having been ‘extensively used in developing the campaign to make misogyny a hate crime’ \( **S8**\). A number of organisations including Citizens UK and the Fawcett Society have drawn on Trickett’s research to call for gender\-based hate crime to be recognised in England and Wales \( **S8**, **S9**\). 

 The research was ‘the catalyst for Nottinghamshire Police to make the decision to begin recording and investigating incidents and crimes perceived to be motivated by misogyny as hate crime’ \( **S3**\). From April 2016, Nottinghamshire Police was the first police force to change the way they recorded and investigated reports of crime allegedly motivated by misogyny \( **S9**, **S10**\). An additional category of ‘gender’ was added to the list of current legal categories used to record hate crime, so that the police now have a more accurate picture of the nature and extent of incidents of harassment and abuse committed against women \( **S5**\). A total of 301 hate crimes or incidents against women were recorded up to February 2020. Previously such incidents would have been recorded under a general criminal offence \(e.g. assault\), or would not have been recorded at all. This new practice ‘showed that the policy had widespread support and has led to behavioural and organisational changes’ \( **S6**\) and has had ‘a positive impact on women victims, and was perceived as helping to gain convictions for related offences’ \( **S8**\). 

 The research has directly influenced the parliamentary debates relating to the Voyeurism \(Offences\) \(No 2\) Bill and amendments to the Domestic Abuse Bill. Stella Creasy MP described the new reporting process as a practice which was ‘transforming the experience of women’ \( **S8**\). It also formed the basis of the researchers’ contribution to a briefing note for the Domestic Abuse Bill Committee, in which they advised that ‘Amendment 84’ be reworded to ensure that misogyny is recorded as a hate crime. Their suggested re\-wording, which was accepted by Commons clerks, ensures that the frequently long\-term nature of domestic abuse would be reflected in the legislation \( **S8**\). The research also informed a recent consultation by the Law Commission evaluating the effectiveness of hate crime laws throughout England and Wales, and underpinned its recommendation that sex or gender should become a ‘protected characteristic’ \( **S9**, **S10**\). The Government has subsequently committed to requiring all police forces across England and Wales to record violent and sexual offences against women, as well as stalking and harassment, as hate crimes where such offences have been motivated by misogyny.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Imperial College led to a change in UK post\-polypectomy surveillance guidelines, minimising unnecessary invasive procedures and ensuring efficient use of NHS endoscopy resources. 

 Imperial College researchers demonstrated that a large proportion of post\-polypectomy patients require less frequent colonoscopy surveillance than recommended in the 2002 guidelines. These findings made a vital contribution to the 2020 guidelines revision, endorsed by the British Society of Gastroenterology, Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland, and Public Health England. Surveillance is now restricted to patients at increased risk of colorectal cancer, which will reduce colonoscopic surveillance workload by up to 80%. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 For patients who have had polyps or adenomas removed, regular colonoscopy is recommended to reduce risk of colorectal cancer \(CRC\). The 2002 UK surveillance guidelines stratified patients into low\-, intermediate\- and high\-risk groups according to characteristics of adenomas removed. These guidelines recommended no surveillance or colonoscopy at five years for low\-risk patients, three\-yearly colonoscopy for intermediate\-risk patients, and colonoscopy at one year followed by three\-yearly colonoscopy for high\-risk patients. 

 The 2002 guidelines were developed before recent improvements in colonoscopy quality and were largely based on detection rates of advanced adenomas rather than CRC at follow\-up due to a lack of long\-term data. This resulted in an over\-estimation of CRC risk. Given the enormous burden placed on endoscopy services by post\-polypectomy surveillance \(20% of all colonoscopies in the UK\), there was an urgent need to reassess surveillance requirements using CRC risk as the endpoint. This would ensure colonoscopic surveillance was targeted to those at increased CRC risk compared to the general population and in whom surveillance is known to reduce risk. 

 In 2006, Imperial researchers initiated a retrospective cohort study of approximately 250,000 patients from 17 UK hospitals to provide data to inform revisions of the 2002 UK surveillance guidelines. 

 They first examined patients with baseline adenomas who were classed as intermediate\-risk. This group accounted for most surveillance colonoscopies – approximately 40% \(12,000 out of 30,000\) patients. Over a median of eight years’ follow\-up, a single surveillance colonoscopy was shown to lower CRC risk by 43%. Moreover, a lower\-risk subgroup \(25%\) of intermediate\-risk patients was identified, whose CRC risk following adenoma removal was substantially lower than in the general population who did not undergo surveillance, indicating that surveillance may not be warranted. The research findings were published in *Lancet Oncology* \(1\) and *The NIHR Journals Library* in 2017 \(2\). 

 The researchers then examined low\-risk \(approximately 14,000\) and high\-risk \(approximately 2,700\) patients, and also collected new data to extend follow\-up to ten years. Among low\-risk patients, CRC risk following adenoma removal was no higher than in the general population without surveillance, indicating that surveillance is not required. Updated data on the intermediate\-risk group corroborated the previous finding that a ‘lower\-risk’ subgroup exists, comprising approximately 40% of intermediate\-risk patients, who do not need surveillance. Finally, surveillance was shown to be necessary and effective for high\-risk patients, who remained at increased CRC risk following adenoma removal. 

 Overall, these findings demonstrated that many patients with adenomas do not require the intensity of colonoscopy surveillance recommended in the 2002 guidelines. Among approximately 30,000 adenoma patients, colonoscopy surveillance was likely unwarranted in 66%, including 25\-40% of intermediate\-risk patients recommended three\-yearly surveillance in the 2002 guidelines. These findings were published in *The NIHR Journals Library* \(3\) and *Gut* \(4\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 There are one million new CRC diagnoses annually worldwide. It is the fourth most common cancer \(c.45,000 new cases/year\) and second most frequent cause of cancer mortality \(c.17,000 deaths/year\) in the UK. It is estimated that the overall cost of CRC to the NHS exceeds £1 billion annually. 

 Most CRCs develop from a type of polyp called an adenoma, and removal of adenomas reduces the risk of CRC. National guidelines recommend surveillance colonoscopy for patients thought to remain at increased CRC risk following polyp removal. Colonoscopy is an invasive procedure that is burdensome for patients, requires intensive bowel preparation and carries a small risk of serious complications. Post\-polypectomy surveillance places enormous pressure on NHS resources, accounting for approximately 75,000\-100,000 colonoscopies every year \(20% of all colonoscopies\) in the UK. For intermediate\-risk patients alone, surveillance \(as recommended in the 2002 UK guidelines\) costs the NHS approximately £2,500,000 over each surveillance three\-year cycle. 

 To reduce this burden on patients and the NHS, Professor Cross and colleagues at Imperial College reassessed these surveillance requirements to inform revisions to the 2002 UK post\-polypectomy guidelines. Dissemination of the findings from this work \(refs 1\-2 above\) highlighted potential beneficial impact on both patients and the NHS and resulted in Professor Cross playing a leading role in the revision of the UK surveillance guidelines and being co\-senior author of the revised guidelines, published in *Gut* in 2020 \[ **A**\]. 

 Imperial research findings were used to determine which patients require surveillance and are cited >60 times in the guidelines to support the evidence statements. Surveillance is no longer recommended for nearly all the low\-risk group and approximately half of the intermediate\-risk group. For the high\-risk group, one surveillance colonoscopy at three years is recommended, compared to a minimum of three examinations in the 2002 guidelines \[ **A**, page 219; Figure 1, page 205\]; this largely aligns with the recommendations from the Imperial team of researchers \(ref 4 above\). 

 The Imperial findings were also incorporated into the latest EU guidelines, which similarly recommend surveillance after three years for the high\-risk group \[ **B**, cited 17 times pages 689\-690, 692\-694\]. 

 The main impact of the new guidelines is a substantial reduction in the number of patients requiring surveillance colonscopy. It is estimated that total colonoscopic surveillance workload will fall by 80% \[ **A**, page 219\], potentially saving approximately 60,000\-80,000 colonoscopies per year. Under the new guidelines, surveillance is already being directed specifically towards patients who remain at increased risk of CRC following polyp removal. Conversely, patients not at increased CRC risk compared to the general population are returning to routine CRC screening based on stool\-based tests. 

 In summary, the new guidelines are minimising patient exposure to unnecessary invasive procedures and alleviating the burden of colonoscopy surveillance on NHS endoscopy services. 

 The reduction in colonoscopy surveillance that has already taken place reflects the efficient dissemination and implementation of the new guidelines. Professor Cross, other guideline authors and national endoscopy stakeholders have used various electronic and web\-based communication, conference presentations, and workshops to disseminate the guidelines. The Imperial researchers have promoted their data and the guidelines via Twitter \(@CSPRG\_Imperial\), and their website \(https://csprg.org.uk/\), by press releases \[ **C, D, E**\], blog articles \[ **F**\], as well as at national and international meetings. Dissemination of the guidelines has been further aided by their endorsement from the British Society of Gastroenterology, the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland, and Public Health England. 

 Public Health England has sent communications to screening services to encourage implementation of the guidelines and the new guidelines are currently being built into the National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme software.  NHS England have worked with cancer alliances, asking NHS trusts to nominate a consultant surveillance lead responsible for guideline implementation \[ **G**\]. The 2002 guidelines were formally withdrawn from gov.uk webpages in July 2020 \[ **H**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Based on University of Bath research, Criminal Justice System policy and practice have improved to better support autistic people through: 

1.  Shaping the National Autistic Society \(NAS\) Best Practice Guidance 2017 and 2020; 

1.  Role\-specific autism training for police officers, mandatory for 2,000 frontline staff since 2018; 

1.  Recommended national roll\-out of role\-specific police training by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Autism in 2019; 

1.  Informing custody suite design plans for a 24\-cell trial at Keynsham Police Station in 2019, reducing adverse incidents during custody; 

1.  Developing alternative police interview models, now used by legal professionals to improve the reliability of evidence provided by autistic witnesses, victims and defendants; 

1.  Routine screening of autistic traits in suspected cyber\-criminals by all Regional Offices of the National Crime Agency since 2019. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Autistic people are substantially overrepresented in all Criminal Justice System \(CJS\) populations, as witnesses, victims and defendants. For example, the National Autistic Society Careless Report \(2014\) identified that 49% of the 1,344 autistic individuals surveyed had been victims or perpetrators of crime. University of Bath research with autistic witnesses, victims and suspects, as well as police officers, has identified positive and negative aspects of lived experience within the CJS \(including perceptions of any adjustments made\) and how differences in autistic communication and cognition impact upon their testimony and the efficacy of questioning strategies. Large scale surveys of these groups, led by Maras between 2014 and 2016, identified the negative experiences of autistic people within the CJS emanating from difficulties in social communication, and the associated challenges faced by police officers carrying out their duties when this involved autistic people \[1\]. In particular, the autism community felt that police and other legal professionals often lack understanding about autism and fail to make appropriate adaptations to support their needs; at the same time, Maras showed that many police officers felt poorly equipped to work with autistic people. Indeed, just 37% of the 394 officers who took part in the research had received prior training on autism, despite 92% feeling *role\-specific* training was needed \[1\]. 

 Issues identified as important by the autistic community largely related to a need for adjustments, especially in custody, and sensitivities around disclosure. For example, only one\-third of autistic individuals disclosed their diagnosis to police/CJS professionals, due to fears that it would not make any difference to the support or adaptations that they received and might even result in negative perceptions and stigmatisation by police. Critically, however, Maras’ subsequent experimental work conducted between 2018 and 2019 showed that, contrary to these concerns, knowledge of an individual’s autism diagnosis actually results in more positive perceptions and judgements about autistic individuals – both as witnesses and defendants – thus highlighting the benefits of disclosure for the autism community, a process which is now supported through the role\-specific training \[2\]. In contrast to beliefs widely\-held by many, Bath research has also identified that while autistic traits are associated with a greater risk of committing cybercrime due to superior IT skills, a diagnosis of autism itself is associated with a *decreased* risk of committing cybercrime \[3\]. 

 A related line of research between 2013 and 2014 has shown how current police interviewing techniques fail to support differences in the way that autistic people remember and recall events, therefore hindering their ability to provide reliable evidence \[4\]. This research demonstrated that the use of the ‘gold standard’ free recall and open questions in police interviews is particularly difficult for autistic individuals due to difficulties in social communication coupled with specific episodic memory difficulties. To address this, between 2015 and 2019, Maras and colleagues developed and empirically tested new witness\-driven police interviewing techniques to enable autistic witnesses and victims to provide their best evidence within a legally appropriate framework. These include a novel *Witness\-Aimed First Account* \(WAFA\) interview model, whereby the witness self\-segments the event at the outset into more manageable ‘chunks’ of information, which they then recall in detail piece\-by\-piece \[5\]. Maras has also developed techniques for probing for further information from witnesses, such as instructional support to optimise accuracy as well as specific frameworks for providing prompts to overcome difficulties with open questions and diagram\-assisted questioning \[6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Maras’ research has shaped local and national changes in training, policy and practice which has improved the experiences and outcomes of autistic people in the Criminal Justice System \(CJS\) in the UK. 

 **Informing best practice guidance and shaping strategy at the National Autistic Society** 

 The National Autistic Society commented that “ *Dr Maras’ research has* *provided a crucial evidence\-base for best practice by criminal justice system professionals when working with autistic people*” \[A\]. 

 Maras’ findings regarding interactions between autistic people and police \[1\], diagnosis disclosure \[2\], and effective interviewing techniques for autistic individuals \[4\-6\] are directly translated into comprehensive best practice guidance in the National Autistic Society \(NAS\) Guidance for Criminal Justice Professionals, revised in 2017 \[Ci\] and 2020 \[Cii\]. The Guidance describes in detail how evidence\-based techniques developed by Maras \(including WAFA, sketching and diagram\-assisted questioning \[Cii, pp. 39\-43\]\) can be applied for autistic interviewees \[C\]. As a result, Maras’ interview techniques are being effectively utilised in the field, with CJS professionals finding them to be effective even when the interviewee has a learning disability and is very limited in free recall \[I\]. Every local UK police force has received a copy of the NAS Guidance and the online version has been downloaded over 4,000 times \[A\]; it is also currently being translated into different languages. The NAS Guide is referenced in the Independent Office for Police Conduct’s July 2019 Learning the Lessons magazine \[D, p.5\] and the College of Policing’s Authorised Professional Practice on mental health \(revised in 2019\) \[E\]. 

 Maras’ research regarding the experiences, treatment and outcomes of autistic people in the CJS has also provided an evidence base to inform NAS strategy more broadly. Indeed, over both policy and practice, the combined impact of Maras’ work “ *has been of enormous value politically*” enabling the National Autistic Society to “ *focus our support, lobbying and influence where it is most needed*” \[A\]. 

 **Improving treatment of autistic individuals by Avon and Somerset Police** 

 Avon and Somerset police stated that “ *Findings from Dr Maras’ research”* have been *“invaluable in providing evidence for best practice for our officers and have had an impact on the Criminal Justice system in improving the treatment of autistic people and the reliability and credibility of their evidence*” \[G\]. 

 Maras’ research led to *role\-specific* online autism training for Avon and Somerset Police, comprising modules on first response, custody and interviewing. The training was co\-produced in 2018 through active collaboration between Maras and Avon and Somerset Police, and is now mandatory for all of their frontline police staff \(approximately 2,000 officers\) \[G\]. The package is currently being reviewed by the College of Policing and the National Police Chiefs Council. The content of the training is driven by Maras’ findings that have identified police training needs \[1\], the importance of diagnosis disclosure \[2\], and her research developing new interviewing techniques for autistic individuals \[5, 6\]. Evaluation data indicates that the 648 police officers who have completed the training demonstrated improvements in autism knowledge and awareness \[G\]. Consequent changes to practice as a result have been universally beneficial; for example, the Avon and Somerset Force Lead for Autism and Head of Policy for the National Police Autism Association highlighted the positive feedback they have received, for example that “ *the insight it provides aids our necessary learning that approaches that are helpful for the neurodiverse are helpful for everyone*”. The training has also proven beneficial for supporting officers at an organisational level within the police service, such as in recruitment or promotion interviews, and has informed policy regarding autism\-friendly policing \[G\]. Dorset Police, Devon and Cornwall Police, Essex Police and the Metropolitan Police Service are actively seeking to adopt the training for their forces \[G\]. 

 In 2019 Maras’ research \[1\] has also informed the design plans for adapting custody suites and related processes at Avon and Somerset Police, including 24 cells at Keynsham Police Station, and 36 cells across Avon and Somerset \[G\]. Plans include ensuring that cells are autism\-friendly \(including soft muted wall colour in cells, controllable LED lighting, TVs in cells, clearer and more detailed explanation of procedures\) and autism training for custody staff \[F\]. Whilst COVID\-19 has resulted in delays in physical changes to all cells, adaptations to custody processes are underway. Indeed, as a result of Maras’ research \[1\], Avon and Somerset is the first Force in the UK to change Force policy to mandate \(since February 2018\) that all detainees who are known or suspected to be autistic are provided with an Appropriate Adult \(whose role it is to act as a safeguard and provide independent support to any suspect deemed to be vulnerable\) in custody \[G\]. 

 Avon and Somerset Police Force’s Lead for Autism states: “ *Findings from Dr Maras’ research have been of direct relevance for the training and adjustments we have made within our force to optimise how we work with autistic people... The knowledge, training and guidance that we have produced as a result of the research has been invaluable in improving the ways that … incidents are handled”* \[G\]. 

 **Guidance for advocates in The Advocate’s Gateway toolkits** 

 Maras’ research regarding best practice interviewing of autistic individuals feeds into detailed guidance in Toolkits for The Advocate’s Gateway \[Ji; Jii\]. The toolkits are used by solicitors and barristers across the UK. Since June 2016, downloads of the ‘Planning to question someone with an autism spectrum disorder’ and the ‘Memory and sensory issues in autism’ toolkits have exceeded 6,422 and 1,988 respectively \[Jiii\]. 

 **Screening for autistic traits by the National Crime Agency** 

 Bath research has also changed police approaches to cybercrime and interviewing.  Specifically, as a direct consequence of the research \[3\], suspects for cybercrime are now routinely screened for “autistic traits” by the National Crime Agency. The Senior Officer at the National Crime Agency states: “ *Research at Bath has been invaluable in updating our intelligence regarding the role of autistic traits \(not autism\) in cyber\-dependent crime…Our Regional Organised Crime Units \(ROCUs\) now routinely screen for autistic traits at first contact with suspects*” \[H\]. 

 **Shaping National Policy** 

 Maras’ research has had a beneficial impact on the policy conversation and evolving strategy concerning the treatment of autistic individuals in the CJS. Maras was a member of the cross\-government working group for the refresh of the 2014 Adult Autism Strategy and a witness on the 2019 Access to Justice inquiry session for the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Autism \(APPGA\), having been invited due to her research on the experiences of autistic people in the CJS and the efficacy of current police practice. Maras’ evidence\-based recommendations form part of a wider portfolio of recommendations and evidence referenced in the resulting report. For example, the report states: “ *In the new autism strategy, the Government should commit to making autism training mandatory for all police officers… to require all new police recruits to undergo autism\-specific training, as well as creating a programme for all existing officers to receive this training*” \[B, p.47, 50\]. The report also cites examples of the good practice that have been developed via her local collaboration with Avon and Somerset Police, including the mandatory provision of Appropriate Adults in all cases where autism is known or suspected \[B, p.48\]. 

 Maras’ work locally with Avon and Somerset Police on the design of autism\-friendly custody suites has also been incorporated at a national level into the Home Office’s 2019 National Custody Design Board Model \[K\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Europe faces immense challenges in the areas of migration and asylum that can only be addressed if the 30 EU\+ countries \(27 EU countries, Norway, Switzerland, UK\) collaborate closely and share information regarding security, migration and asylum\-seekers across the continent. Professor Moser’s research expertise in multi\-stakeholder cooperation, decision\-making and information\-sharing has directly helped the European Asylum Support Office \(EASO\) Strategic Network to improve communication and collaboration among its 30 member countries. The research identified common ground and established new ways of communicating that has reduced conflicts, supported more equal and effective decision\-making, and increased information\-sharing. This has enabled EASO to lay the necessary foundations to move forward with new initiatives to improve harmonisation of migration and asylum policies across Europe. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The 30 EU\+ countries coordinate, facilitate and strengthen practical cooperation on many aspects of asylum and migration through the European Asylum Support Office \(EASO\) Strategic Network. The body of research on cooperation, decision\-making and use of digital technologies that underpins Professor Moser’s work with the EASO Strategic Network straddles psychology and computer science and spans the boundaries of organisational behaviour, social psychology, behavioural economics, Human\-Computer\-Interaction and cognitive science. 

 Moser’s research aims to understand how \(digital\) technology **\[R2, R3\]**, managerial practices, such as feedback and status rewards **\[R6\]**, as well as social norms **\[R6, R3\]** and social value orientations **\[R6\]** impact on people’s willingness and ability to cooperate, both face\-to\-face and online. She uses experimental studies **\[R3, R5, R6\]** as well as field research **\[R1, R4\]**, applying multimethod approaches such as surveys, interviews, and document analysis. Professor Moser was one of the first researchers to extend social dilemma research on natural resources and in economics to the intangible assets of knowledge and information\-sharing dilemmas **\[R6, R5, R4\]** that are central in both, the knowledge economy and when working remotely. 

 Professor Moser’s research on knowledge\-sharing and cooperation dilemmas has shown the importance of motivation and social status for stakeholders to be willing to cooperate at both individual and organisational levels, and how the perceived costs and benefits of cooperation interact with structural and cultural constraints. For example, her research on expertise transfer revealed that for experts, the recognition of their expert status within their organisation was crucial to be willing to share their knowledge with less experienced team members **\[R6\]**, showing the importance of supervisor feedback and recognition. The research also showed that this was even more effective with highly competitive team members with a pro\-self value orientation. Further experimental studies showed how situational constraints such as project\-based cooperation for a short time led to a task focus of team members whereas long\-term collaboration promoted a relationship focus **\[R5\]**, thus fundamentally changing the costs and benefits of cooperation depending on the time frame. Knowing about these temporal effects helps to maximise prosocial motivation of collaborators, making them more effective and focussed on the core performance outcomes. Her field research with 118 representative NHS healthcare teams **\[R4\]** confirmed the importance of a collaborative climate at work and showed how teams scoring high in helping and information\-sharing behaviours also showed higher team innovation, even in cross\-functional teams with high occupational diversity and large team sizes. 

 Further experimental studies showed how group memberships and the social identities associated with professional status groups **\[R3\]** impact on the willingness to comply with collaboration requests. The research also shows how these effects of in\-group favouritism and out\-group biases can be exacerbated in an online environment, for instance when using emails, with people experiencing strong negative emotions and making negative personal attributions that can lead to increased conflict and a breakdown of cooperation at work. The enormous impact of group identities on digital media use was also corroborated in her field research of London street gangs and their strategic use of social media to create and promote a gang identity **\[R1\]**. The different opportunities that digital technologies create are strongly influenced by how the technology behind the world wide web evolved, from a mere online repository of information in Web 1.0 to an immersive digital environment in Web 4.0 that responds interactively to user behaviours and preferences **\[R2\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 For several years, the 30 member countries of the EASO Strategic Network had been dissatisfied with the cooperation between themselves and with EASO as the coordinating European Commission agency. Cooperation on asylum and migration was inconsistent and unequal and they wanted help to improve their information\-sharing and joint decision\-making. Aware of her reputation in this field, the EASO Strategic Network \(StratNet\) appointed Professor Moser as European Commission Senior Expert Advisor \(October 2017 to December 2020\) based on her research expertise in knowledge management, cooperation and decision\-making in the workplace, and her proven track record of successful applications of her research in both the private and public sectors. 

 Between October 2017 and December 2020 Professor Moser worked closely with the EASO StratNet, which includes representatives from all 30 EU\+ countries and from EASO. Her research expertise has helped the members of the EASO StratNet to identify and acknowledge the main causes of conflict, the areas of common ground on which they agree, to establish new ways of communicating both inside and outside of meetings, to agree on definitions of expertise, \(which had been in dispute for many years\) and to put in place a mentoring scheme to develop that expertise. These changes have improved collaboration between member countries continuously since the start of Professor Moser’s mandate in October 2017 and provided the EASO StratNet with the basis to move forward in further harmonising joint guidance and decision\-making on asylum and migration in Europe. 

 As part of her mandate, Professor Moser was given confidential access to all EASO network communications and documents, and to the EASO digital repository. She spoke to all national country Heads \(highest civil servants responsible for Country of Origin \(COI\) security information and guidance in each of the 30 countries\), to the EASO representatives, and numerous national COI experts. She was also an observer at two ‘hotspot’ country expert network meetings in 2019 and presented her findings at four EASO StratNet meetings in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. 

 **Identifying common ground and creating a framework for collaboration** 

 The representatives of the 30 EASO Strategic Network member countries felt at an impasse, with ongoing disagreements about core issues, such as the purpose of the EASO networks, the contributions of each country in terms of personnel resources, joint guidance, COI gathering, security updates, rewards for national contributions, and the definition of COI expertise and securing long\-term COI knowledge: ‘ *Even though we implemented the networks with a lot of enthusiasm, competition among Member States and EASO as well as unequal resources and different ideas shaped the discussion in the networks from the beginning. For this reason, we asked EASO for an external evaluation, as we realised that we were getting stuck in the same discussions about more and less the same topics.*’ **\[S1\]**. 

 Based on her research, Professor Moser identified 3 types of common good among the 30 StratNet countries: Type 1 \(EASO as service provider\); Type 2 \(EASO as joint policy and guidance agency\); and Type 3 \(StratNet as community of experts\). There were, however, differing levels of commitment from each member country to these three areas as a direct result of differences in national resources, policies and legal constraints and even reporting structures across the 30 countries. Everyone valued the community of experts, the majority valued EASO as a service provider, but joint policy and guidance was most disputed with only a third of countries supporting this. From April 2018 onwards, these findings provided a new framework to identify the main conflicts among the 30 EU\+ countries that had held up and blocked collaboration before ‘… *by providing a pragmatic analysis of common ground that the member states can use as basis for future development*’ **\[S2\]**. It allowed members to name the differences in a factual way, to de\-escalate the conflicts and move forward. Type 1, 2 and 3 common good has now become part of StratNet’s vocabulary, enabling members to identify the common ground that provides the basis for cooperation and preventing them from getting fixated on the areas of dissent that prevented constructive solutions in the past **\[S1\-6\]**. One member explains the effect this has had: ‘ *Your presentation \[in April 2018\] had a long\-lasting and almost immediate beneficial impact on the functioning of the Strategic Network. The relationship between EASO and national COI units switched from confrontational to bargaining.*’ **\[S5\]**. 

 **Reducing conflicts and improving cooperation between all 30 EU\+ countries:** 

 Due to Moser’s research, barriers that previously prevented the 30 EU\+ countries from moving forward have become unstuck. The countries report a much improved collaborative climate in the meetings, with an increased willingness to compromise among all stakeholders **\[S1, S3, S4, S5\]**. As one stakeholder observed: ‘ *We understand now much better what purpose each measure in our cooperation serves \(common good\) and are better able to accommodate the different needs by making compromise.*’ **\[S5\]**. 

 The analysis established that the main causes for conflict and different levels of cooperation were due to differences in national resources among the member countries as well as national differences in policies, dividing European states into resource\-rich and resource\-poor countries and countries separating security information completely from policy guidance and decision making and those who combined them. Making this clear, and establishing that it was a rational consequence of national differences, enabled the member countries to move away from the blame game and unproductive discussions and to instead focus on the substantial common ground and agreement that did exist **\[S1, S5, S6\]:** ‘ *Among other things, I have learned from your analysis that we should make our conflicts of interest more transparent by naming and acknowledging them.*’ **\[S1\]**. 

 Moser also found that for resource\-rich countries, recognition of their contribution towards harmonisation of asylum procedures and joint security information and assessment was an important motivator for their continued support, but was not routine practice by EASO. Visibility of member state contributions was increased based on Professor Moser’s recommendations, with countries named and explicit recognition of the exact type of contributions acknowledged, including naming the individual national experts that contributed: ‘ *EASO \[now\] acknowledges contributions of national units better*’ **\[S5\]**. For members, this change also helps to justify the effort put into European collaboration, as it provides important evidence when reporting to their ministers and within their national political contexts. 

 **Introducing new ways of communicating and achieving more equal share of voice** 

 Moser’s recommendations have improved communication, created more equal member country participation in the EASO Strategic Network and in country specific meetings and helped to better support members, as evidenced here **:** ‘ *Communication in and between meetings between the Strategic Network members and 30 EU\+ countries has clearly improved, in particular by advising on how to structure meetings and to ensure that more discussions take place and decisions are made in meetings*’ **\[S3\],** and: ‘ *Some of the measures you suggested … have already been implemented: since then, meetings reserve more time for strategic and tactical discussions which led to a higher degree of satisfaction of representatives*’ **\[S1\].** Another source states: ‘ *Meetings have also become more equal in terms of member contributions, and with more active participation overall*’ **\[S4\]**. In particular, smaller countries with less resources in the areas of migration and asylum feel heard and much better able to state their interests **:** ‘ *I think your work gave us \[small countries\] a louder voice...I believe the most important impact for me personally was the little push you gave EASO to modernize its way of communication and interaction. Having large meetings like StratNet made it difficult for everybody to be heard. Discussions often veered into the same directions and always involved the same participants*’ **\[S6\]**. 

 Moser’s analysis and feedback has motivated EASO to move away from emails and to introduce interactive digital platforms, e.g. Microsoft Teams, that have empowered the network members to be more active and involved. This has increased country participation in preparing meetings and during them, for example by introducing anonymous digital feedback tools such as Slido, break out groups, and a better, more communicative setup in the meeting rooms **\[S1\-S6\]**. The benefit for members of introducing digital formats to complement physical meetings is that it ‘… *gave everybody an equal voice and an easy way of communicating by PC or Smartphone. Being able to communicate anonymously also helps colleagues with less confidence or people not wanting to get into an argument with more “important” member states to give their opinions*’ **\[S6\]**. This change in operation, which predated the COVID\-19 pandemic, has been particularly beneficial during 2020: ‘ *The stakeholder analysis of costs and benefits has provided clear indications of common ground and needs among the member states for virtual collaboration and has already led to changes in the network collaborations and the introduction of new digital tools and formats, also at physical meetings before the Covid19 pandemic*’ **\[S3\]**. 

 On Professor Moser’s recommendations, EASO also increased its support of their own EASO network leads who coordinate and moderate all meetings and network communications between the 30 StratNet member countries: ‘ *EASO, in turn, committed to support their network facilitators with communication, leadership and persuasion training to improve management of the networks and communication at COI meetings*’ **\[S1\]**. 

 **Increasing knowledge sharing and policy harmonisation** 

 One of the most crucial changes brought about by Moser’s work with the EASO StratNet was support for a joint understanding of the definition of ‘COI expertise’. This was highly disputed by members for years but now has been agreed on between all 30 countries. The analysis has ‘… *given the EU\+ member states a handle on how to understand what is the common ground of expertise and knowledge that is needed to further develop the EASO networks and the Country of Origin Information \(COI\)*’ **\[S2\]**. This was an important obstacle to overcome as unless there was agreement on who was recognised across member states as having the COI expertise on which security and policy decisions are based, there was little hope of further harmonising joint guidance and decision\-making regarding asylum in Europe. Developing and securing COI expert knowledge is also central to equalising resources among member states. For most hotspot countries of origin \(e.g. Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Somalia\) there is only a small number of COI experts across Europe who have the in\-depth knowledge to inform security decisions on asylum and migration. ‘ *Since your first input in 2018, EASO has been continuously improving the format and the content of country specific network meetings and harvested better the inputs from national experts. We understand our responsibility for supporting EASO in organizing meaningful sessions and for achieving our common goals*’ **\[S5\]**. 

 Many small or resource\-poor countries don’t have the expertise at all, and have to rely on European cooperation, which was not always forthcoming. However, during the yearly appraisals in December 2020, more country experts than ever volunteered to engage in future EASO network activities: ‘ *They obviously are willing to follow \[Moser’s\] call for more active participation and focus on questions related only to their specialization. They seem to trust the process*’ **\[S5\]**. Moreover, Moser’s recommendation of a new mentoring scheme between member states to support the development of new COI experts has been agreed by Heads of National Units: ‘ *This includes concrete developments of a mentoring system between member states to support the continued development of knowledge and new COI experts in these highly relevant areas*’ **\[S2\]** and ‘… *there was agreement among the Heads of Units to try out the proposed Bilateral Mentoring Scheme*…’ **\[S1\]**. 

 The 30 EU\+ countries are now joining forces to further harmonise their country information and guidance with joint reports, fact\-finding missions and mutual support regarding hotspot countries and sensitive topics \(e.g. LGBT\+ and women’s rights, ethnic persecution, access to education and healthcare\) to determine the right to asylum and the basis for visa decisions in Europe. New ways of communicating have been established and mutual support systems agreed, making EASO more effective as a coordinating agency and enabling the EASO StratNet to move forward with new initiatives: ‘ *Professor Moser’s expert support has already had a visible impact in supporting the development of a joint understanding of asylum and migration relevant information, policy and security analysis and increased the collaboration between EU\+ member states. I expect this to further benefit the integration of asylum processes across Europe*’ **\[S3\]**.

 **1.** **Summary of the impact** 

 Antimicrobial resistance \(AMR\) is a global crisis. We need to raise awareness of the dangers of antibiotic misuse and how it can be prevented. Walker’s research has influenced ways of communicating information about AMR in community pharmacies. Impact is shown through increased professional and public understanding and awareness of antibiotic resistance, and improved working practices in community pharmacies in the UK and Rwanda. Organisations have benefitted, including Public Health England, the Commonwealth Pharmacy Association \(CPA\) and the Rwandan Community Pharmacists’ Union \(RCPU\), who now recognise that design\-led approaches enable effective and relevant public health communication. The impact has been further extended to benefit cross\-disciplinary approaches to public health communication beyond AMR. 
","
 **2.** **Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research is concerned with the communication and public engagement challenges around the global antimicrobial resistance crisis. Working across disciplines and organisations, research in the UK and Rwanda used co\-design to raise awareness in communities, and among practitioners, of a crisis that threatens to transform the effectiveness of taken\-for\-granted medicine. Stakeholder and end\-user engagement was key to ensuring effective benefit and reach of the research. 

 A strand of research was concerned with investigating information design solutions and their application in health communication from an historical perspective. It included research on the Isotype Institute’s approach to health communication, such as a poster campaign in 1930s USA that raised awareness of the danger of TB. This research identified principles of effective health communication that could be applied to antimicrobial resistance and other health issues today. 

 In the UK, the AHRC\-funded research project, **‘**Information Design and Architecture in Persuasive Pharmacy Space: combating AMR’, \[IDAPPS\] aimed to improve knowledge and understanding of AMR with perspectives offered by information design, human factors, architecture and pharmacy, and input from pharmacists, pharmacy users and patients. The project partnered with a Day Lewis pharmacy ensuring the input of pharmacy practitioners as well as providing a realistic location in which to situate the research. 

 Innovative co\-design used a competition format to produce  [5 approaches](https://amrpharmacy.org/five-ideas-for-talking-about-drug-resistant-infections/) to explaining the dangers of AMR and how to avoid it in the context of community pharmacies. One winning solution was explored in a second research project following the CPA’s interest in one of the prototypes. This  [research in Rwanda](https://amrpharmacy.org/co-designing-information-about-antibiotic-resistance-in-rwanda/), which resulted in the Beat Bad Microbes campaign, involved development and iterative review of a set of materials about antibiotic resistance in English and Kinyarwanda languages. 

 The research demonstrated the benefits of user\-centred approaches to design, including the engagement of the public and other stakeholders with research. Positive feedback about our explanations of drug\-resistant infection has demonstrated the relevance and significance of effective design of this kind of information, especially the design of procedural instructional text, checklists for action, and illustrative material. The research also affirmed that community pharmacies both in the UK and in Rwanda are convenient, socially inclusive locations to distribute information about AMR. It confirmed that pharmacists and pharmacy workers are both willing to be involved and have a key role to play in engaging people with information about antimicrobial resistance but established that they have limited time to do so, and therefore need efficient persuasive resources. 

 The research was disseminated in several ways including: 

-  Invited displays of IDAPPS work including exhibitions at Design4Health, Sheffield Hallam University, September 2018; at AHRC event at London Design Week, September 2018; and at the Day Lewis National Conference, London, November 2018. 

-  Invited presentations about the work: RCPU international conference in Kigali, September 2019; webinar to Q community, October 2019. 

-  IDAPPS digital exhibition ‘Towards the persuasive pharmacy’  [<ins>https://amrpharmacy.org/exhibition/</ins>](https://amrpharmacy.org/exhibition/) 

-  The Rwanda project ‘Beat Bad Microbes’ was recognised with an Antibiotic Guardian commended award in 2019. 

-  Beat Bad Microbes has been shared via the Facebook Women in Pharmacy group \(over 6500 members worldwide\), and a related LinkedIn post had over 1000 views, leading to networking and engagement opportunities.

1.  **Details of the impact** 

 The research and its application have benefitted organisations through recognition of the value of design\-led collaboration and creative approaches to health communication, specifically in relation to AMR. Pharmacists in the UK and Rwanda are now equipped to provide clear advice and information on the dangers of AMR to members of the public visiting community pharmacies, who now have a better understanding of what they can do to help prevent its spread. 



 **Impact on working practices in community pharmacies to raise awareness of AMR** 

 The IDAPPS research project influenced a Public Health England campaign on Anti\- Microbial Stewardship \(AMS\) in community pharmacies, including the design of an  [<ins>antibiotic checklist</ins> ](https://amrpharmacy.org/files/AMRPharmacy.dispense.form.pdf)and an accompanying video to increase pharmacy staff’s capability, opportunity and motivation to provide self\-care and adherence advice to people collecting prescribed antibiotics \(E1\). In a pilot in Gloucestershire 931 checklists were completed by patients and carers in 12 pharmacies, with feedback from 13 community pharmacists who distributed the material. Positive feedback resulted in agreed roll\-out in pharmacies in Wales, Northern Ireland and four English regions, temporarily postponed due to COVID\-19. 

 In Rwanda, the award\-winning Beat Bad Microbes \(BBM\) materials raised awareness of AMR. The  [<ins>materials</ins> ](https://amrpharmacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pilot-materials-kigali.pdf)included an innovative antibiotic record card, co\-designed with pharmacists and pharmacy users, to enable patients to hold details of their prescription and any side effects, and information about how to take antibiotics correctly. Feedback from the Rwanda Community Pharmacists’ Union \(RCPU\) was that their involvement in BBM had raised the status of community pharmacists enabling them to provide a high\-quality service and to “keep antibiotics working”. Pharmacists in Kigali, who piloted the materials, recommended their use in all pharmacies in Rwanda \(E2\). 

 This led to a national rollout of the materials in Kinyarwanda and English languages via the RCPU website, endorsed by the Rwanda Pharmacy Council for CPD, and supported by a recording of a live\-streamed webinar in collaboration with the Commonwealth Pharmacy Association  \(August 2020\), explaining how to make and use the materials \(E3\). The CPA, following success of BBM in Rwanda, have endorsed and  [<ins>promoted</ins> ](https://commonwealthpharmacy.org/beat-bad-microbes-raising-awareness-of-amr/)the BBM materials through the Commonwealth Partnership for Anti\-microbial Stewardship in Africa \(CwPAMS\) in partnership with Antibiotic Guardian Africa \(E4\). 

#  Social impact: increasing public understanding and awareness of AMR 

 The research in the UK and in Rwanda made a difference to people’s lives by raising awareness of the dangers of AMR and how this might be addressed. As part of the co\-design process for BBM, a workshop was held in Rwankuba village Rwanda to raise public awareness of antibiotic misuse: “Involving our village in this project was amazing as they learned a lot, now they are mindful that abusing antibiotics, taking antibiotics not prescribed by a recognized health professional and not completing the full course prescribed can harm their life, and they are the champions of this project” \(Chief, Rwankuba village\) \(E5\). Day Lewis pharmacy users in Reading responded positively to the IDAPPS prototypes and affirmed that their engagement was piqued by the novel ways of presenting information, and that they learnt something new about AMR, for example, the extent to which antibiotics were used in farming \(E6\). An infographic “Be AMR Aware” developed in the IDAPPS Ideas Lab was installed in a pharmacy in Kennington. Of 156 respondents to an evaluation survey, 77% said they learnt something new about AMR as a result of engaging with the intervention \(E7\). 

 **Cultural impact: creativity and communication** 

 The research drew attention to the Isotype Institute’s approach to health communication, and its materials were used in the IDAPPS Ideas Lab to influence the design of one of the  [<ins>project outcomes</ins>](https://amrpharmacy.org/exhibition/spaces/): “There is something immediately capturing and engaging about other humans and faces. It is tangible and can be related to; and we wanted to create a similar tangibility.” 

 IDAPPS research stimulated inter\-disciplinary creativity: illustrators, interior designers, mindfulness coaches and architects worked with microbiologists, doctors and pharmacists to experiment with ways of communicating ideas about AMR. For example, knitted  [<ins>microbes made in</ins>](https://amrpharmacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/knittedbugs.pdf)  [<ins>thermochromic wool</ins> ](https://amrpharmacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/knittedbugs.pdf) changed colour when held, thus demonstrating that bugs, rather than people become resistant: “we wanted to test other ways of engaging with the public through hands\-on activities and presentations”. The team led by Napper Architects extended their IDAPPS work with Beyond Resistance to explore and find solutions to tackle AMR \(E8\). 

 **Industry and public sector impact: cross\-disciplinary collaboration** 

 Walker’s research has demonstrated the effectiveness of cross\-disciplinary working to overcome the challenges of communicating the dangers of AMR and has led collaborators to develop participatory approaches in other areas of their work. Design companies involved in IDAPPS research benefitted: Design Science subsequently collaborated with a bio\-medical scientist \(workshop attendee\) on an Innovate UK funded project in India, [<ins>‘Milk Guard’</ins>](https://milk-guard.com/) to help treat mastitis and reduce AMR in cows and buffalo; the design studio ‘the letter g’ was employed by PHE to work on antimicrobial stewardship materials. Design\-led collaboration between IDAPPS team members \(bio\-science and information design\) stimulated a  [<ins>campaign</ins> ](https://sites.reading.ac.uk/imagine/project/improving-covid19-testing/)at Reading for public donation and volunteer engagement in developing and providing feedback on instructional text used in home\-testing kits \(as part of response to COVID\-19\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Trauma Informed Care \(TIC\) is an approach to integrated health and social care that aims to facilitate service users’ recovery without re\-traumatisation. The approach is relatively new to the UK, and embedding TIC within large organisations such as the National Health Service \(NHS\) is challenging. Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys \(TEWV\) NHS Foundation Trust, a UK pioneer in the adoption of TIC, used Northumbria’s research into complex system modelling in their implementation strategy. As a result, national guidelines for TIC were developed, and TIC was included in the national NHS Long Term Plan \(2019\). A digital Consensus Tool developed by Northumbria led to improved practitioner knowledge of TIC, and strengthened a community of practice. Another digital tool developed by Northumbria, the Wellbeing Diary, was used by the TEWV Trust to assess a new intervention that was offered to healthcare workers and the public during the COVID\-19 pandemic. The Wellbeing Diary allowed the TEWV Trust to evidence a statistically significant impact of the intervention, helping them to prioritise strategic directions for the organisation. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Northumbria Social Computing \(NorSC\) research group explores human\-centred aspects of computer science. One strand of NorSC’s work, led by Dr Petia Sice, focuses on modelling social systems using a complex systems approach. This investigates how relationships between a system’s parts influence the behaviour of the system as a whole \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. 

 Organisations may be understood as complex and dynamic systems containing social networks of interactions, where importance is put on the relationships between people, as well as on the actions of individuals \[ **R2**\]. Sice investigated how individuals’ attitudes and actions towards information handling emerges within organisations. Her work showed that positive changes in this information behaviour may be achieved through improvements to the environment or infrastructure within which this information is used and processed \[ **R2**\]. Sice’s research also examined nodes and connections in the context of information behaviour, and how the quality of interactions at these points is affected by organisational culture \[ **R1**\]. 

 In 2016, through working on a wellbeing project with blue light services, Sice was introduced to the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys \(TEWV\) NHS Foundation Trust. Angela Kennedy, TIC Lead at the Trust, approached Sice to apply her modelling of social systems research \[ **R2**, **R3**\] to help the Trust introduce a new approach to mental health services – Trauma Informed Care \(TIC\). Within the mental health service, those who experience trauma are often pathologised, i.e., seen as ‘people with the problem’. TIC is an approach that aims to address this view through the creation of safe, open, and trusting environments to facilitate the healing of emotional wounds left by trauma. While individual clinicians and organisations in the UK had previously used TIC in their practice, there was no nationwide guidance explaining TIC or how it could be implemented service\-wide. 

 Northumbria’s work on modelling social systems \[ **R1**\- **R3**\] was used to create a protocol for a nationwide summit for UK clinicians who used TIC in their practice, which was held in March 2019. The summit aimed to identify the main principles of TIC from the experiences and observations of clinicians, service workers, and people with lived experience of trauma. Using information sharing between all participants and an open narrative enquiry method, which allows information to be filtered until consensus is reached, the summit successfully identified key principles of TIC on which all participants agreed. These principles were further refined at a follow\-up workshop in July 2019, enabling them to be used for policy development. In addition, participants specifically identified the need for digital tools that would enable practitioners to enhance understanding of TIC principles and strengthen the community of practice through an online network. 

 Under the leadership of Northumbria’s Garry Elvin, the team created several digital tools to help the TEWV Trust embed TIC within the organisation and assess wellbeing interventions, including a novel Consensus Tool. Development of this tool drew on Dr Yilun Shang’s work on resilient consensus in complex networks \[ **R4**\]. Shang’s research proposed an opinion\-formation model featuring both a private opinion \(not known by others but evolving under local influence\) and an expressed opinion \(varied under peer pressure to conform to the local environment\) for a given topic over a dynamical network \[ **R4**\]. The Consensus Tool is an online system that used Shang’s theoretical framework to allow participants to regularly access statements \(on topics related to TIC and organisational priorities\) and express their opinion on the topic. After giving their views for the first time, on subsequent occasions participants may see their original opinion and also the opinions of other participants with whom they were connected through the network. While taking into account the opinion of others, participants were asked to review their opinion and submit another opinion based on the same statement. This allowed participants to iteratively develop their opinion on certain issues, while reflecting on their own and others’ views on the topic. 

 Another innovative digital tool developed by Northumbria, the Wellbeing Diary, was designed as an evaluation tool to help the Recovery College \(part of the TEWV Trust\) to assess the success of their Music for Wellbeing intervention \[ **R5**\]. This used an integrative model of individual wellbeing, which treats wellbeing as comprising of three streams of information, each corresponding to a particular dimension of wellbeing \(physical, mental, social\). The Wellbeing Diary focused the participants’ awareness of their immediate experience of these dimensions of wellbeing, as well as their sense of pleasure/displeasure prior to and after listening to music from a choice of playlists provided, including ones intended to be relaxing or enlivening. Analysis showed statistically significant positive changes in emotional wellbeing, valence, and sense of meaning \(all p<0.001\), with a medium effect size. Findings also indicated a statistically significant change for physical wellbeing \(p=0.009\), with a small effect size \[ **R5**\]. Analysis of participants’ wellbeing diaries showed that the relaxing playlists led to lower arousal, and enlivening playlists led to an increase in activation, helping the TEWV Trust to assess the success of the intervention built on TIC’s principles of self\-reflection and empowerment.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys \(TEWV\) NHS Foundation Trust applied Northumbria’s research findings to embed Trauma Informed Care \(TIC\) within the organisation and helped to shape the first national policy for TIC in the UK. Collaborative work between TEWV and Northumbria University also helped to establish a network to both support practitioners and enable them to use consensus\-building tools to develop improved services. An innovative assessment tool was deployed in a national wellbeing initiative. 

###  4.1 Development of a national framework and influence on NHS Long Term Plan 

 In 2017, the TEWV NHS Foundation Trust set an objective to embed a TIC approach within clinical services. Although this approach is widely used in the USA and practiced by individual clinicians and community organisations in the UK, no national guidelines outlining the main principles of TIC existed at the time. Implementing TIC approaches \(in the absence of national guidelines\) within such a large organisation, which employs more than 6,500 staff and has an annual operating income of over GBP300,000,000, presented a complex series of challenges. 

 The March 2019 national summit \(organised on behalf of the Northern England Clinical Networks and the North East and North Cumbria Academic Health Science Network\) and the follow\-up workshop in July 2019 enabled the main principles of system capability in TIC to be developed \[ **E1**, p5\]. The summit distilled a number of main standards: the way TIC is delivered \(in terms of safety, human experience, language, empowerment\); the way services are organised \(through healing interventions, responsive system design\); and the kinds of relationships that make a TIC service effective \(compassionate and transformational leadership, relational reparation\). Creation of these standards resulted in the publication of the Commissioning Framework on TIC, ‘Developing real world system capability in trauma informed care: learning from good practice’ \(2020\) \[ **E1**, p5, p10, p21 acknowledge Northumbria\]. Angela Kennedy, TIC Lead at the TEWV Trust, stated: 

 *‘Dr Sice was instrumental in co\-developing with me the methodology for a national TIC summit \[that\] enabled the TEWV Trust and the Northern England Clinical Network to develop a novel understanding of the main principles of TIC in the context of the UK, based on the experiences of the TIC summit participants. The summit distilled a number of main standards…These standards formed the core of the comprehensive Commissioning Framework report…Since its inception the Commissioning Framework has become a key document used by practitioners across the UK when embedding TIC in their work’* \[ **E2**, p2\]. 

 Northumbria’s work, and the success of the TIC summit, led to the inclusion of TIC in the national NHS Long Term Plan \(2019\) \[ **E1**, p3\]. The NHS Long Term Plan now states that: *‘New and integrated models of primary and community mental health care will support adults and older adults with severe mental illnesses. A new community\-based offer will include…trauma\-informed care’  \[ **E3**, p69, para3.94\]. For the most vulnerable children and young people, *‘The development of a high\-harm, high risk, high vulnerability trauma\-informed service will provide consultation, advice, assessment, treatment and transition into integrated services’* \[ **E3**, p118, para12\] *.* 

###  4.2 Facilitating implementation of TIC 

 The pioneering work of the TEWV Trust on TIC attracted GBP120,000 investment from NHS England for the development of a national learning community to promote TIC – the FutureNHS Collaboration Platform, as part of the Long Term Plan objectives \[ **E2**, p2\]. Northumbria’s work for the summit and on consensus\-building in complex systems was incorporated into the platform. Northumbria’s researchers created four digital tools; two of these are still in development, and two have been deployed \(the Consensus Tool and Wellbeing Diary, described above\). The Consensus Tool \[ **E4**\] is used by a digital community of practice in the national learning community and also within organisations. It is used to explore challenging questions and investigate how to reach consensus in cases where divergent opinions exist. Angela Kennedy, TIC Lead at the TEWV Trust, stated: 

 *‘\[We\] used the tool during webinars, to monitor how staff opinion on certain matters changed. For example, we recently organised a national webinar on inequality and discrimination on the FutureNHS website…The tool was used before and after the webinar by over 100 NHS staff, allowing us to understand where the community’s values and beliefs lie, and hence understand the directions in which we need to work’* \[ **E2**\] *.* 

 The tool has allowed the TEWV Trust to actively manage how they implement TIC, as well as facilitate dialogue within the professional community. 

 As well as the creation of a national framework and development of the digital practitioner network, the summit also benefitted participants pioneering TIC in their work in the UK. 85 participants attended the workshop, and they included clinicians, chief executives, policy makers, commissioners, representatives of the NHS, social care practitioners, people with lived experience of trauma, and stakeholders working in charity organisations \[ **E2**, p2\]. Feedback collected from almost two\-thirds of the participants \(n=56\) showed that 96% of participants were ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ to do something as a result of the workshop, indicating increased motivation to embed TIC in their practice \[ **E5**, p1\]. Open field responses ranged from *‘thinking about making cultural change sustainable’* to *‘I will look to use this technology in the co\-production of pathways/services in the future’* and *‘I would definitely like to try using the approach, i.e., mini narratives/case studies in other work\-related workshops’* \[ **E5**, p4\]. More than 90% of participants were ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ to keep in touch with fellow workshop participants, indicating a strengthening of the community of practice \[ **E5**, p2\]. Other participants appreciated the opportunity to improve their knowledge of TIC and co\-produce TIC principles alongside a diverse community of practice \[ **E5**\]. 

###  4.3 Change in strategic direction to support NHS staff 

 Northumbria’s Wellbeing Diary digital tool helped the TEWV Trust to evaluate the success of wellbeing interventions \[ **E6**\] and make decisions about how to deploy them. The Wellbeing Diary is embedded within the Music for Wellbeing intervention and is based on the principles of self\-reflection and empowerment that are critical within TIC. It invited participants to reflect on their perceived state of stress, physical state, arousal, and mood before and after the intervention. By using an online tracker, participants were able to self\-manage their wellbeing. Before the COVID\-19 pandemic, the tool was used by the Recovery College \(part of the TEWV Trust\) with service users; after the outbreak of the pandemic, it was opened up to the wider public, in order to help people manage their wellbeing during prolonged periods of lockdown and self\-isolation. The Wellbeing Diary helped to evaluate the Music for Wellbeing intervention, showing statistically significant positive changes in emotional wellbeing resulting from the intervention \[ **E7**\]. These results enabled the TEWV Trust to make strategic organisational decisions. Angela Kennedy, TIC Lead at the Trust, said: 

 *‘\[O\]ver 300 people used the optional Wellbeing Diary developed by Northumbria. Our online tool helped us to understand the effectiveness of the intervention…The Wellbeing Diary showed that appropriately curated playlists may be able to lead the listener to positive relaxation or activation states, or to positive mood change that may have health benefits. Seeing such positive outcomes, we decided to re\-purpose the wellbeing tracker to create an online tool specifically for NHS staff, helping to boost personal wellbeing during the stressful times of the pandemic’* \[ **E2**\]. 

 The Music for Wellbeing intervention, and the Wellbeing Diary embedded in it, were included in \(and endorsed by\) the Culture, Health and Wellbeing Alliance’s report discussing 50 case studies focused on ‘How creativity and culture are supporting shielding and vulnerable people at home during COVID\-19’ \[ **E8**, p18\-19, p22\-25\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The housing market in the UK has been described as “broken”. It is seen as one of the greatest barriers to progress in building a stronger and fairer Britain. Becoming increasingly unaffordable, housing accounts for more than a third of the disposable income of 2,200,000 working households with below\-average income \(Housing White Paper, 2017\). Research at Reading has informed a number of government policies aimed at improving the affordability of and access to housing; these include the government’s annual house construction target \(300,000\), set with a view to increasing supply, and therefore improving affordability. The empirical model developed at Reading is fully embedded in policy cycles across numerous government departments, including the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government \(MHCLG\). It also underpins the twice\-yearly housing market forecasts conducted by the Office for Budget Responsibility and used in negotiations with HM Treasury over public expenditure planning. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Long\-term research at the University of Reading \(backed by funding of approximately GBP1,000,000 from MHCLG since 2005\) has led to the development of an econometric model of regional housing markets \[ref 2\]. Originally developed in the early 2000s to look at the effects on affordability of increases in housing supply, the model is still in widespread use and has expanded its scope to cover questions related to housing tenure, financial deregulation, the effects of Brexit and Right to Buy sales as recent examples. Simulations are conducted using the model, to determine the predicted impacts of changes in key policy variables on the outcomes of interest, in particular affordability \[ref 5\]. 

 Regularly used to underpin government policy, the model has been refined over time and is an econometric model of housing affordability at the regional level, including specifications of the housing and labour markets, and demographic segments. For example, recent research has examined intergenerational aspects of housing affordability and the factors that affect opportunities for home ownership among different cohorts, in particular first\-time buyers \[ref 6\]. Meen’s research at the international level has also suggested that housing supply in the UK is less responsive to price rises than in other countries, implying that shortages and a lack of affordability can persist for prolonged periods \[refs 1 and 4\]. 

 Modelling the effects of policy changes on housing is complex and had not been attempted on this scale in Britain before. Housing mobility, for example, implies that the effects of increases in housing supply on regional affordability are difficult to capture since households are likely to move into areas where new housing is being constructed, potentially offsetting any improvements in affordability in those areas. The interactions between these different factors affect not only house prices and affordability, but also household formation and the proportion  who are owners, all of which are captured within the model \[ref 3\]. In contrast to official projections of household formation \(which are trend\-based\), the model allows users to consider how worsening affordability reduces the number of new households. In summary, the model demonstrates the strength of economic forces, and the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on housing. 

 The premise that housing affordability can be improved through increasing supply is underpinned by the model and reiterated in the 2017 Housing White Paper, ‘Fixing our broken housing market’. However, the key issue was by how much housing supply would need to be increased in order to induce a major improvement in affordability; this was a difficult quantitative issue because of the interdependencies across local markets. Contrary to expectations at the time, the conclusions were that supply increases would have to be very large and sustained over long periods of time to have a significant effect on affordability. This fundamentally challenged the traditional view, according to which planning decisions for housing should be based on expected increases in the number of households, as opposed to the need to modify the housing supply. Meen’s research showed that increases in provision would need to be much larger; and this indicated that there would need to be significant building on greenfield sites, where the cost of building is typically lower and supply responses to price changes are greater \[ref 4\]. While this analysis originally attracted considerable controversy, it is now generally accepted as correct, although political realities prevent the conclusions from being fully adopted. Nonetheless, since 2017, the government has had a house\-building target of 300,000 dwellings per annum, underpinned by the research at Reading, which is much higher than recent outturns.

","
#  4. Details of the impact 

 Research conducted at the University of Reading by Meen, demonstrating how increasing housing supply can improve affordability, has underpinned the key econometric model used for housing policy analysis and forecasting across government. Reflecting Meen’s longstanding expertise in housing, and his close working relationship with MHCLG \(for which he was awarded an OBE\), the model has expanded beyond the focus of affordability and housing supply to embrace related issues of tenure, financial deregulation and Right to Buy Sales, as well as broader cross\-government priorities, including Brexit. Indeed, when analysts “consider policy interventions, the model is used implicitly \(if not explicitly\)” and is “fully embedded in the policy cycle” \[Section 5, source 1\]. Results are shared with the Office for Budget Responsibility \(OBR\), the official independent forecasting agency, and are used in negotiations with HM Treasury over public expenditure planning. In particular, the model has informed government “understanding of the housing market and how changes in the economy and demography will affect housing outcomes” \[source 1\]. 

 “Our broken housing market is one of the greatest barriers to progress in Britain today. Whether buying or renting, the fact is that housing is increasingly unaffordable – particularly for ordinary working class people who are struggling to get by” \(Theresa May, foreword to Housing White Paper, 2017\). In this context, Meen’s research has changed and informed the government’s policies around housing supply \[sources 1 and 2\]. Outputs from the model were shared with ministers and showed that “at current levels of house building, affordability will get worse” and “provided a compelling case to be more ambitious about creating the conditions for supply to be permanently higher” \[source 1\]. The model’s predictions that even housing supply significantly above current levels would only lead to a slowing of worsening affordability has “compelled \(policy\) ambition to be bolder and more radical” \[source 1\]. Thus, an annual government target of 300,000 additional homes was set out in the November 2017 government budget. If the government delivers 300,000 new homes per year \(including change of use and/or office conversions\), this will constitute a significant increase in the rate of house\-building, since the number built in a year averaged only 177,000 in the period 2005/06 to 2017/18 \(according to the Public Accounts Committee\). The evidence\-informed goal represents a change in local authority target\-setting, as targets were previously set according to anticipated increases in households and are now being informed additionally by affordability indicators on a regional basis. The government trajectory towards the target of 300,000 is regularly updated on the basis of housing government forecasts informed by the model and shared across Whitehall by the Secretary of State, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Cabinet Office \[source 1\]; potential shortfalls are the trigger for further investigation and policy changes. 

 ‘Fixing our broken housing market’ has caused much debate in the UK and is recognised by the government as key to building a stronger, fairer Britain \(White Paper, 2017\). Despite this, the most recent figures for affordability show that, on average, full\-time workers could expect to pay an estimated 7.8 times their annual workplace\-based earnings on purchasing a home in England and Wales in 2018 \(Office for National Statistics, 2019\). Current statistics show that housing in 77 local authorities became less affordable over the last five years \(Office for National Statistics, 2018\), with the gap between the most and least affordable areas continuing to widen. In recognition of the variance in affordability according to geography, the model has been used to inform government policy on the geographical targeting of housing investment in high\-demand areas such as London and the South East \[source 1\]. 

 Meen’s long\-term engagement with parliamentary select committees, the MHCLG and the OBR has continued as successive governments have utilised his expertise to tackle a variety of important economic and social policy issues. For example, the OBR produced the working paper *Forecasting House Prices* \[source 3\], which looked to develop a five\-year forecast using models for house prices, whilst examining insights regarding the drivers of house price rises. This forecasting approach was based heavily on a series of Meen’s papers, most notably his 2013 paper \[ref 6\] and forms part of OBR’s core forecasting activities on house prices today \[sources 1 and 3\]. 

 Meen also contributed to parliamentary debate through his appointment as a Specialist Adviser to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee Inquiry into the UK housing market in 2015/16 \(House of Lords 2016, ‘Building more homes’, source 4\). The Committee concentrated on ways of increasing housing supply \(the theme of a number of government and independent reports\) but was sceptical of the widespread view that increasing general market housing would benefit those on low incomes. This was consistent with Meen’s work on the effects of increases in housing supply; the Committee then called for the relaxation of controls on local authority borrowing in order to increase the amount of affordable housing. Controls have now been relaxed. Furthermore, the results produced by the model showed that new affordable housing output does not significantly crowd out new private housing supply; this has been used by MHCLG to “convince HM Treasury of the efficacy of affordable housing investment” \[source 1\]. The model has also been used “multiple times” to test “the impact of changes to stamp duty” and was “influential in the eventual HM Treasury decision” to make changes to Stamp Duty in 2017 \[source 1\]. 

 Although work on the model was suspended during the period of the Coalition government, the need was such that it resumed in 2015 with a rebuilding of the model to reflect new policy priorities. Further updating, including the most recent research on tenure, took place in 2018/19. For example, the model’s Right to Buy sales equations are used to forecast the numbers of local authority housing sales to tenants across the UK regions. The MHCLG “uses this to project the total amount of income that it expects local authorities to receive from sales. This provides the basis for estimates of the amount that authorities must spend on replacement housing stock to comply with the requirement to spend receipts within three years. The modelling results are shared with the OBR at Fiscal Events, and feed into the Local Authority Self\-Financed Expenditure forecasts” \[source 1\]. The model has also been used to inform potential policy interventions in the event of a “no\-deal” Brexit \[source 1\]: “The model was used to test multiple Brexit scenarios and how they would affect the housing market. The potential impacts on housing construction, housing transactions, house prices and affordability were looked at. The analysis provided a baseline to design potential policy interventions in case of a no\-deal, including where to focus our attention and what the trigger signs might be in a housing downturn” \[source 1\]. 

 Meen has also provided guidance on housing economics and the use of models since the model’s inception, training successive generations of economists in the Ministry since 2005; in terms of skills capacity, Meen facilitated the setting\-up of a system within MHCLG which will enable the ongoing training of economists in\-house. In addition, he was invited to give a seminar on housing affordability to MHCLG staff, including researchers and policy analysts, in January 2017. Subsequent to this, he provided oral evidence to the House of Commons Communities and Local Government Committee on housing for older persons in January 2018, and this is cited in the final report \[source 7\]. There is a view that there is no housing shortage in Britain. Rather, older households are “under\-occupying” housing, particularly once their children have left home. Therefore, if they could be encouraged to downsize, the housing problem would be reduced. One view is that the failure to downsize is due to the lack of suitable alternative accommodation. However, Meen’s evidence concentrated on the absence of incentives to do so. Most older\-person households have paid off their mortgages and so their housing costs are low; the tax system, and expected capital gains in housing assets over time, encourage them to stay. 

 Meen also gave advice on both modelling and policy to the independent Redfern Review into the decline in home ownership \(2016\); this was commissioned by the Shadow Secretary of State for Housing. The technical report accompanying the Review, on forecasting house prices and home ownership and produced by Oxford Economics \[source 5\], cites 11 papers by Meen out of a total of 25 references, alongside providing the basis for house price modelling. More recent work with the UK Collaborative Centre for Housing has been used to inform the Affordable Housing Commission Report *Defining and Measuring Housing Affordability – An Alternative Approach* \[source 8\]. 

 Beyond England, a commissioned review of tax revenue forecasting models for the Scottish housing market concluded: “The models that were most popular for forecasting house prices included error\-correction models. Particularly, the most influential literature for practitioners in the UK was the work of Geoff Meen” \[Scottish Government, source 6\]. 

 In summary, this body of research has underpinned cross\-government policy reform aimed at addressing the challenges in the UK’s “broken” housing markert. Of particular concern has been the rise in housing costs, making housing increasingly unaffordable. In terms of reach, Meen’s long\-term research has been adopted on a national scale and has informed a variety of important economic and societal policies associated with housing. Significantly, in addressing the barriers to a “fairer and stronger Britain”, it has informed “radical” policy decisions \(for example, housing targets\) which have urgent and compelling ramifications for planning policy and housing affordability as a whole.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A novel design tool developed at the University of Aberdeen has been used around the world to enable optimal, user\-centred design of hybrid renewable energy installations that meet local needs. The tool uses ‘multi\-objective optimisation’ to allow both system developers and customers to contribute to solutions for renewable energy systems \(comprising two or more energy sources\) at the design stage. The design tool improves performance prediction by providing increased transparency, leading to increased end\-user confidence. The work has led to improved, user\-centred designs supporting customers in the UK and Jordan, addressed the needs of disadvantaged, off\-grid communities in both Turkey and Malaysia, and enabled the development and production of mobile, affordable water makers in sub\-Saharan Africa and India.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Hybrid renewable energy systems \(HRES\) are systems that rely on more than one energy source \(e.g. wind, solar\). Prior to installation, the system designer has to evaluate what renewable resources are available, estimate demand load for a particular build and decide on the appropriate HRES configuration, which presents a challenge. Ideally, this planning stage will result in a size\-optimised combination of renewable, non\-renewable \(e.g. diesel\), storage and backup components. 

 HRES design methods are not traditionally developed with the end\-user in mind. Rather methods have focussed on the system designer and on supporting the installation process. This has presented an issue since traditional performance measures \(e.g., average annual power production and unmet load\) produce non\-specific readouts and provide little meaningful information that can enable customers to assess the cost\-benefit of a particular design. This can lead to an unsatisfactory design, poor value for money and reputational damage for the designer. These issues have hindered the worldwide growth of the renewable energy market, due to discrepancy between the predicted \(expected\) and actual performance. 

 A well\-formulated HRES customer\-focused design would correlate any tolerable loss in power to a gain in the cost. Since joining the School of Engineering in 2016, Dr Alireza Maheri, has developed a design methodology capable of addressing the root cause of the planning\-design problem \[1, 2, 4 and 5\], building on previous research undertaken at Northumbria University. By introducing new reliability measures, namely, the ‘blackout distribution’, ‘mean time between failures’ and ‘plannable load’ the HRES system developed at Aberdeen can be tailored more effectively towards end\-user requirements and translated into the tolerability of a power cut \[1\]. 

 By using nondeterministic analysis to subject test systems to simulations of real\-world uncertainties in model parameters \(such as available renewable resources, demand load, power and cost\), Maheri found that industry\-standard deterministic design methods, regarded as ‘traditional’ methods, were often overdesigned resulting in costly, unreliable and/or unpredictable performance \[1\]. 

 In particular, the integration of high safety factors to overcompensate for the uncertainties, was found to increase in the cost of the system without necessarily increasing the reliability of the system’s power supply \[1\]. Maheri has shown that exclusion of end users from the design phase, leads to unrealistic expectations and a lack of understanding of the role of technical assessment criteria. By introducing new reliability measures such as the annual blackout \(power cut\) distribution and the mean time between failures and assigning a level of confidence \(LoC\) to each criterion, Maheri has developed an HRES system that provides the end user with performance measures that are both tangible and realistic \(e.g., a total annual power cut of 30 hours @ 99% LoC instead of the unrealistic claim of no unmet load\). This specificity leaves much less room for misinterpretation and increased customer confidence \[P1; 4\]. 

 Maheri’s most recent research has also focussed on addressing machinery\-load planning issues for production lines where the energy is supplied entirely or partially by renewable resources leading to the development of a robust multi objective algorithm for minimising the production cost and maximising the share of renewables in power supply \[5\]. This new nondeterministic assessment, design optimisation and load planning method has been successfully implemented in a software tool for Multi Objective Optimisation of HRES \(MOHRES\). A web\-based \(open access\) version of the tool, with limited functionality, is available via the University of Aberdeen \[3\]. The full version of the tool is available to provider/consultancy companies on request. 

 MOHRES translates the end\-user requirements into the system’s technical performance through new performance measures which can be easily interpreted by the end user, thus providing a bespoke and cost\-effective solution \(type and size of renewable, storage and/or auxiliary components in the system\) \[1, 2, 4 and 5\]. MOHRES works by providing a realistic analysis of the system performance by accounting for uncertainties \(renewable resources, demand load, power and cost models\) and applying operational characteristics \[1, 4\]. Moreover, its flexible formulation provides additional features such as integrated configuration\-size optimisation and inclusion of energy management system characteristics \[5\]. 

 MOHRES also offers retrofitting capability, which allows the system designer to introduce new components into an existent system \(e.g. diesel\), in order to gradually transition to renewables and thereby define energy transition scenarios. Maheri has been working with the Universite Des Mascareignes \(Mauritius\) since 2018 to develop and evaluate a series of different energy transition scenarios using MOHRES in order to aid efforts to meet national climate mitigation ambitions, including the uptake of 35% mixed renewable energy generation by 2025. Maheri acts as an advisor to the Faculty of Sustainable Development and Engineering at the Universite Des Mascareignes, Business Mauritius, the Central Electricity Board and the private sector in Mauritius \[S5\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 One of the key issues facing the renewables market, specifically design and installation of HRES has been the lack of consideration around end\-user design and ultimately user requirements. Since 2016, Maheri has focussed on developing a user\-centric design, which caters to the end user needs and takes into account the user’s financial constraints. MOHRES \[2, 3\], developed at the University of Aberdeen has underpinned the development of made\-to\-measure energy systems that are designed with direct input from the end user, ensuring that the resultant HRES can feasibly meet the demands and mitigate the cost for the customer. 

 At the system\-design and supplier level, particularly in the renewables sector, this user\-centric design acts as a crucial form of risk reduction, given that end\-user demands are comprehensively addressed at the design phase. Maheri’s research has led to impact in the following ways: 

-  Addressing shortcomings of ‘traditional’ deterministic design methods across industry and differentiating the product offer 

-  Supporting growth of renewable energy companies in highly competitive markets such as Jordan and Sub\-Saharan Africa 

-  Providing research and expertise to facilitate change in traditional industry practice in UK and Malaysia 

-  Improving the welfare of off\-grid communities in Turkey, Malaysia, sub\-Saharan Africa 

 **Speaking the same language: MOHRES helps energy consultancies and providers gain the trust of current and new end users through intuitive design** 

 In order to build awareness of MOHRES in the engineering community of the ‘plannable load’ algorithm, Maheri has actively demonstrated its capabilities at a series of workshops for industry in close collaboration with the University of Northumbria \(September 2018, with another due to take place in March 2021\). These workshops have enabled participants to see the tool ‘in action’ and have led to direct requests by companies to have access to the full version of the software for conducting comparative assessments. This has facilitated the wide adoption and deployment of MOHRES in UK, Malaysia, Turkey, Mauritius and Jordan. 

 At the workshop held on September 2018 in Rome \[2\], Jordanian\-based energy company Al\-Narjes Energy, requested access to MOHRES, which they have now utilised, for planning and delivering of 60 HRES projects with total capacity of 1.5 MW \(as of April 2020\) in Jordan for private clients \[ *text removed for publication*\], applying the approach to operations ranging from telecommuting, electricity and construction of roads. This has enabled the company to compete in Jordan, which is considered to be one of the most competitive investment environments in the renewables market and is ranked third by Bloomberg’s Climatescope \[S1\]. Al\-Narjes Energy have confirmed that the new design methodology offers a cost\-effective solution relative to current standard practice, noting that the tool had enabled “ *provision of high level of confidence in both customer satisfaction and reliability and subsequent increase in our customer base by 30% \[equivalent of 12 projects\].*” Since September 2018, several systems have been installed for commercial and residential projects, including places of worship, schools and private farms, introducing cost saving and reducing dependency on fossil fuels \[S1\]. 

 Energy Renewable UK \(Ltd\), with whom Maheri has collaborated as part of \[P1\] since joining Aberdeen, have also adopted MOHRES in their configuration and size optimisation tool. The company have used it to deliver a number of projects towards decreasing the dependency of automated dairy industry to grid \(UK\) \[5\], and a cost\-effective transition from a diesel\-powered to a renewable\-powered system in a rural off\-grid crop processing community in Malaysia \[3\]. Energy Renewable UK have found the tool to be extremely effective in tailoring HRES based on customers’ needs, taking into account financial limitations and power supply requirements for off\-grid communities and compatibility with productions line for industry stating: 

 ‘*Undoubtedly, we owe our success in expanding our business overseas, competing against prominent local companies, and the high success rate in our responses to tender to this collaboration \(with Aberdeen\)*.” \[S2\] 

 New reliability measures, enabled through MOHRES and employed by Energy Renewable UK, have been of particular interest to customers with limited financial resources and have introduced capacity for sustainable energy production in low\- and middle\-income countries. As a testament to their diverse portfolio, Energy Renewable UK \(Ltd\) has now employed the new reliability measures \(load planning\) to deliver a project for a remote off\-grid community in Turkey \(wind\-PV\-battery\) \[5\]. The case study from this project shows how tolerability of a power cut with a maximum length and frequency can lead to significant cost saving \(agreed as minimum requirements by the end users\) and could be easily translated into new reliability measures. These measures, which are incorporated into the optimisation of the HRES, enable the company to find a solution which matches the end\-user requirements and has a total lifespan cost only 55% of that of a system designed traditionally, leading to significant cost savings for the customer \[5; S3\]. 

 **End user centered design \- support for small industries in energy transition** 

 In 2019, Maheri was awarded an Innovation Voucher \[P2\] as part of a start\-up venture with UK\-based oil & gas manufacturing company Aashraya Ltd and provider of components to the oil & gas sector. In 2020, and as a result of the collaboration, Aashraya Ltd entered the renewables market in sub\-Saharan Africa and India, one which is dominated by non\-renewable energy sources such as diesel, particularly in remote, low\-income communities. By working with the company to integrate MOHRES into their current systems, Maheri has supported Aashraya Ltd in bringing their first prototype system with load\-planning capabilities to market trial. The system developed, a solar\-powered water\-maker, is cheaper than diesel\-based systems \(currently dominating the market\). The lower total lifespan cost of the prototype gives the company a marketable advantage over potential renewable\-powered competitors \[S4\]. 

 In conjunction with the company’s own in\-house expertise, MOHRES has facilitated the design of a portable, renewable\-powered \(PV\-battery\) system that operates optimally in different geographical sites with variable water demand, complex weather and variable solar resources, in direct contrast to systems that are designed to operate optimally in one site and hence are inefficient or unadaptable to sites with complex demands \(e.g. variable weather systems\). By using the ‘plannable load’ algorithm implemented in MOHRES, the company have been able to identify the best operation time throughout the day to produce the targeted amount of water whilst minimising the operational hours of the water\-maker to maximise the lifespan of the system. The reported case study in \[5\] is based on Aashraya Ltd water\-makers, showing 29% and 49% longer lifespans for the water maker unit and the battery bank when the load planning algorithm in MOHRES is used \[S4\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Our research has shaped the understanding and implementation of national and international laws and policies protecting asylum\-seeking and trafficked children and adults. It has ensured the development of Guardianship schemes for all trafficked children in England and Wales, and in addition for unaccompanied minors in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It has also helped to reverse government policy, ensuring that unaccompanied asylum seeking\-children would regain access to legal aid. The research has extended public and professional understanding of Modern Slavery and its impact on trafficked people; it has changed narratives about refugees, highlighting their contributions to their new societies across Europe; and has improved practices for those who work with people who are vulnerable through forced migration. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Every year people engage in *forced migration* when they move from their homelands because of war, poverty or natural disaster. While their reasons for moving extend beyond the definitions of the 1951 Refugee Convention and allied protocol, understanding the experiences of those forced to migrate is vital to supporting them in their new countries. In shaping the meanings of support for forced migrants, our empirical enquiries encompass their needs and vulnerabilities as well as their capabilities within countries of sanctuary. In line with this latter focus, our work adds a distinctive new thread to the empirical literature, using arts\-based methodologies. These contributions define and refine the ways refugees are understood as help seekers and as bridge builders within new societies. Together, these engagements exemplify our approach to refugees as talented creators and curators of their lives. 

 Our underpinning research has focussed on unaccompanied asylum\-seeking children. This work laid a foundation for understanding how they sought \(and sometimes found\) safety, belonging and success in new countries. Our work tracked young asylum seekers’ experiences of keeping silence and secrets, and managing time, transitions and waiting, as well as foster care and food pathways. Cody’s work from 2013, as one example, focussed on the meaning of ‘reintegration’ for unaccompanied \(including trafficked\) children \[ **3.1**\].  Since that time our work has broadened to include adults who are trafficked, as well as forced migrants displaced through natural disasters and poverty. On the basis of our range of work, we were commissioned by the Home Office to evaluate the provision of independent Guardianship for unaccompanied minors and other children subject to trafficking in England and Wales. \[ **3.5**\]. 

 Consolidating this focus, our research has examined other issues facing forced migrants. In 2015, Connolly authored the first of two research reports \(an update was published in 2017\) on separated migrant children’s access to legal aid in partnership with the Children’s Society \[ **3.2**\]. Between 2017 and 2019, Hynes led a four country study on human trafficking across Albania, Viet Nam, Nigeria and the UK in partnership with the International Organization for Migration \(IOM\) and funded by the Modern Slavery Innovation Fund \(MSIF\) \[ **3.3**\]. Funded by the British Academy, Hutchinson worked across several research projects in partnership with *Terre des Hommes* \- *Lausanne* \(Tdh\) on child protection in refugee communities \[ **3.4**\]. This work, examining early marriage as a tactic of survival for young women in the context of forced migration, has built a framework within which risk and protective factors can be understood by practitioners and policy makers in nuanced, context specific ways. It demonstrated the efficacy of a tool used to assess hope and resilience \[the Hope tool\] among migrant children, paving the way for better more targeted support. 

 In 2016, Wroe founded the charity ‘ *Social Work without Borders*’. The charity takes a social justice approach to its work. It provides pro\-bono expert social work reports for people enduring asylum and immigration decisions. In 2019 Wroe’s reference book \[ **3.6**\], linked to the charity’s values and commitments, brought together academics, asylum seekers, practitioners and activists to define and promote social justice based approaches to working with refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in the UK and internationally. 

 The ESRC funded ‘separated child migrants' care relationships and caring practices’ project \[2019\-2023\], on which Kohli is Co\-I, has begun to describe how children care for one another in contexts of forced migration.  In 2020 Kohli as PI received funding from NordForsk for a 4 year project on *Relational Wellbeing in the lives of young* \[adult\] *refugees in Finland, Norway and the UK*. It was one of seven projects funded by NordForsk out of 220 applications by international research teams.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Our work has informed legislative design in all UK countries. It has impacted on social policy to generate supportive and sustainable futures for forced migrants. It has improved professional practices across a range of state and non\-state actors internationally, as shown below. 

 **Impact on UK legislation and social policy** 

 Our work has led to independent Guardianship being established for all trafficked children in England and Wales, and for unaccompanied asylum seeking children in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The role of a Guardian is to provide reliable and trusted long term adult support for a child, and to link and bridge between welfare, immigration and criminal justice services to secure the best interests of that child. A Guardian is, to use a term coined by us in 2013, someone who is *by the child’s side, and on their side*, as they navigate these complex systems. In 2010 we evaluated the first such scheme in Scotland. In 2014 we pioneered the plans for a Guardianship service in Northern Ireland. Our 2015 report \[ **3.5**\] took the next steps in defining Guardianship within the terms of s48 of The Modern Slavery Act 2015. It set the foundations for a new independent service in England and Wales. Via ane Independent Expert Advisory Panel on child trafficking, we advise the Home Office on the rollout of Guardianship in England and Wales. 

 Since 2012, Kohli has acted as an advisor to a number of Select Committees in both Houses of Parliament, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Migration, and the Children’s Commissioner for England. Following our work on Guardianship, in 2018 Kohli was invited to advise and assist parliamentarians in reviewing s48 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and its impact on child trafficking \[ **5.2**\]. This resulted directly, *inter alia*, to the Government dispensing with the title of Independent Child Trafficking *Advocate* \(ICTA\) and replacing it with Independent Child Trafficking *Guardian* \(ICTG\) to reflect the role’s scope beyond advocacy, as indicated by our empirical findings. The parliamentarians that formed the review committee \[Baron Field \(then Frank Field MP\), Baroness Elizabeth Butler\-Sloss, Maria Miller, MP\] noted in February 2019 that:  *We were all hugely impressed by the breadth and quality of the evidence you gathered, as well as the level of personal and professional insight you brought to your commentary and recommendations. We have studied your findings and proposals closely to inform our own recommendations to the Home Office, and I am sure you will be able to recognise your influence clearly reflected in our interim report. Your contribution to the Review on this topic has been invaluable to us.* \[ **5.2**\] Kohli’s underpinning empirical work on silence and secrets in the lives of unaccompanied children was chosen in 2020 by the British Journal of Social Work as among 50 outputs that are *crucial in understanding social work in the past and informing research and practice of the future*. 

 Connolly’s 2015 research \(updated by her in 2017\) on the impact of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 \(LASPO\) on separated migrant children was crucial in enabling their access to legal aid. Before 2012, about 2,500 separated migrant children per year had relied on legal aid to resolve their immigration claims. This stopped as LASPO came into force. Connolly’s research was used to successfully bring separated children back into scope of legal aid in October 2019 \- the only group to be brought back into scope. Through this work, scope now includes children’s citizenships claims in legal aid for the first time, as well as legal aid applications for EU nationals. In a testimonial to Connolly’s work the Children’s Society noted in December 2020 that: *Dr Connolly …ensured our work was of the highest standard but also worked in ways that helped us to maximise impact and retain a tight focus on the needs of unaccompanied children and the needs of our judicial review*… *Dr Connolly’s work with us is one of the best examples of academic impact we have come across* \[ **5.1**\] 

 **International impacts** 

 From 2013 Cody’s research has yielded fresh understandings of the differences between ‘reunification’ \(a line of connection back with family\) to ‘reintegration’ \(a circle of wellness within a community\). This holistic approach led to her output \[ **3.1**\] within her broader work of designing a toolkit for monitoring and evaluating reintegration for separated children. It was subsequently disseminated by the RISE Learning Network \(led by the international NGO Family for Every Child\) across 12 ‘learning partners’ in sub\-Saharan Africa, South Central Asia and Latin America \[ **5.1**\]. The findings from this work were cited extensively by the UN Special Rapporteur in 2015 in her report on care, recovery and reintegration programmes for child victims of sale and sexual exploitation \[ **5.7**\]. 

 Through Hutchinson’s pioneering evaluation of the Hope tool, building on \[ **3.3**\], community\-based child protection programmes have been deployed by Terre des hommes \(Tdh\) to build resilience amongst Palestinian refugees. The training and investment in social workers that the programme pioneered has resulted in the growth of workforce development teams in Tdh across the Middle East and North Africa \(MENA\) region. This can be corroborated through testimonies from Tdh country teams in Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. The results of Hutchinson’s work on child marriage among Syrian Refugees in Jordan and Lebanon was published in 2020 \[ **5.4**\]. Tdh is able to confirm via the sources cited under Hutchinson below, that this research has significantly influenced their programme and policy on child marriage, and informed applications to donors for funding. About 70% of their new framework of action on child marriage in the region is based on our research. 

 Working with the French charity *Apprentis D’Auteuil,* Kohli’s research was used to create innovative social work practices across four European States \(France, Italy, Germany and Greece\) \[ **5.3**\]. These are aimed at protecting and enhancing the everyday wellbeing of unaccompanied asylum seeking children. A key output of this project was the production of online training via subscription to a Digital Notebook for those working directly with these children in Germany, Italy, France and Greece. This was launched in Paris in October 2020. The notebook currently has 1000 practitioner subscribers across Europe, with the aim of securing 3000 by the end of 2021, once the German, Italian and Greek versions of the Digital Notebook are launched. In appraising Kohli’s impact on the project, Apprentis D’Auteuil observed in April 2020: *Today, I can say without a doubt that inviting \[Kohli\] to join our project’s team was certainly one of the most crucial decisions we have made for our project’s success. Our fruitful common collaboration will most certainly have a significant impact on the field social work, when it comes to providing better care to unaccompanied minors in our countries in Europe. We are very grateful for the time and passion Professor Kohli brought to our project, and we hope that this only marks the beginning of our collaboration in the years to come...* 

 Opfermann’s and Evans’ research studies in South Africa and Scotland respectively \(submitted as outputs, not listed here\) using theatre and visual arts, precedes Kohli’s work using visual art methodologies in the NordForsk project. Turning the lives of young refugees into theatre based performance art or visual arts exemplifies our approach to refugees as talented curators of their lives. Moving beyond narratives of refugees as needy, these contributions define and refine ways these young people are understood as builders and creators within their new societies. 

  

 Hynes’ study of trafficked people \[ **3.3**\] resulted in expanded and enhanced networking amongst counter\-trafficking professionals across Viet Nam, Albania, Nigeria and the UK \[ **5.5**\]. The research report by Hynes is currently a key reference in the latest Country of Origin reports used by asylum decision makers at the Home Office \[ **5.5** shows the COI for Albania as an example\]. The study directly informed IOM’s approach and practice around social stigma in Indonesia and Ethiopia. IOM have confirmed the impact of this work across Viet Nam, Albania and Nigeria, particularly in relation to understanding prevention, the provision of services for men, boys and atypical ‘victims’ of human trafficking and mental health needs. In a testimony to the University in December 2020, IOM in Viet Nam wrote: *Dr Hynes's knowledge and expertise in the field of migration and human trafficking and lead on the research led to a successful analysis and research report. It helped IOM Viet Nam successfully secured a UK funded trafficking project entitled Tackling Modern Slavery in Viet Nam \(TMSV\). This research resulted in wide recognition of the issue of trafficking and vulnerability of Vietnamese migrants in the UK, and need to improve the evidence\-base, through further research and evidence to support the operational work of IOM and other agency' s work to counter trafficking in Viet Nam.* In October 2020, this study achieved two A\+ grades within the Home Office’s evaluation of the effectiveness of the Modern Slavery Innovation Fund \[ **5.5**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 LSHTM research underpinned the rollout of the novel group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine \(MenAfriVac\), which halted the scourge of epidemic meningitis across the African meningitis belt and prevented over 100,000 deaths. More than 300 million people aged 1 to 29 in this area and in neighbouring countries had the vaccine. The clinical trial showed for the first time that MenAfriVac was highly effective at preventing meningococcal disease and carriage. This accelerated the move to implement mass vaccination campaigns, which ultimately led to group A meningitis virtually disappearing from the entire region. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 For the last century, there have been frequent large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis  in the Sahelian and sub\-Sahelian region of Africa. Stretching from the Gambia in the west to Eritrea in the east, the area is known as the meningitis belt. These epidemics were mostly caused by strains of *Neisseria meningitis*, the meningococcus belonging to the capsular group A. With no vaccine, the epidemics caused many deaths and widespread disruption to the health systems and communities. In 2001, a public\-private partnership \(The Meningitis Vaccine Project\) of the World Health Organization \(WHO\), the non\-profit global health organisation PATH, and the Serum Institute for India, developed an affordable group A meningococcal vaccine for use in Africa. The vaccine, MenAfriVac, was prequalified by the WHO in 2010 based on its safety and immunogenicity, but there were no direct data on its ability to prevent meningococcal disease. Scientists needed to study carriage to fully understand the epidemiology of meningococcal infection as most people infected with meningococcus show no symptoms, but are responsible for transmitting the infection. Therefore, a successful vaccine had to prevent carriage. In 2009, an LSHTM\-coordinated consortium, The African Meningitis Consortium \(MenAfriCar\), was set up to study meningococcal carriage in the African meningitis belt. This included an evaluation of the impact of MenAfriVac on meningococcal disease and carriage, led by LSHTM’s Greenwood. 

 Chad — the only country in the meningitis belt to be experiencing a group A epidemic at the time of the first deployment of MenAfriVac — was unable to introduce the vaccine across the whole country simultaneously due to its large size and underdeveloped infrastructure. Only the capital N’Djamena and its surroundings were vaccinated initially. This staggered implementation provided an opportunity for MenAfriCar to study the impact of the MenAfriVac vaccine \(3.1, 3.2\). LSHTM staff working within MenAfriCar established strong links with partners in Chad and the consortium strengthened epidemic surveillance measures and laboratory detection of meningococci in the country. LSHTM staff obtained funding for the evaluation, planned its design and supported local teams undertaking surveillance for meningitis, detection of carriage and laboratory detection of *N. meningitidis* and other causes of meningitis. LSHTM’s main partner in Chad was the Centre de Support en Santé International, which carried out some of the surveillance activities and conducted the carriage studies. LSHTM staff also worked with the Ministry of Health and Médecins sans Frontières in their efforts to contain the epidemic. Laboratories in Oxford and Oslo undertook molecular characterisation of meningococcal isolates obtained during the epidemic. 

 In 2012, when vaccination was restricted to N’Djamena and surrounding areas, there were 57 cases of meningitis in approximately 2.3 million residents in the vaccinated areas, and 3,809 cases among the 8.7 million residents in the non\-vaccinated areas. This represented a 94% reduction in case incidence of meningitis. Vaccination had been restricted to those aged 1 to 29, but cases were prevented in all age groups, suggesting that the vaccine interrupted transmission of the epidemic strain by preventing carriage of meningococcus. 

 The 2 large pharyngeal carriage studies conducted by MenAfriCar from 2010 to 2012 in an area south of N’Djamena confirmed this observation. 32 group A meningococcal carriers were found in 4,278 age\-stratified subjects 2 to 4 months before vaccination, but only one carrier was found in the 5,001 subjects tested 4 to 6 months after vaccination. This study demonstrated for the first time that MenAfriVac was highly effective in protecting not just vaccinated but also unvaccinated individuals, via herd immunity, and could halt an epidemic. 

 Further evaluation studies by the consortium in countries which had introduced the vaccine demonstrated that MenAfriVac had achieved high vaccination coverage, with results published in 2015 showing significant decrease of disease incidence and reductions in pharyngeal carriage in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals \(3.3, 3.4\). These provided further confirmation that the vaccine generated herd immunity and prevented meningitis A epidemics.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research carried out by the MenAfriCar consortium in Chad, led by staff from LSHTM and local partners, demonstrated for the first time that MenAfriVac was highly effective in reducing transmission of group A meningococcus by preventing carriage and thus halting an epidemic. It also suggested that if people across the meningitis belt were given the vaccine, group A meningococcal disease could be eliminated. Crucially, the findings gave the international community, including The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization \(Gavi\), the confidence to invest in and accelerate widespread deployment of the vaccine. It has since been given to over 300 million people in Africa through mass campaigns. On the basis of study results, MenAfriVac has also been incorporated into the routine infant immunisation programme in many African meningitis belt countries to sustain protection against group A outbreaks. 

 **Informing vaccination strategy** 

 The trial results were disseminated through face\-to\-face meetings with stakeholders in the Ministry of Health and major non\-governmental organisations in Chad, as well as with WHO staff. The study findings were also presented in reputable journals, at a meeting of the UK Meningitis Research Foundation in November 2013, and at a symposium during the 2014 annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. 

 LSHTM researchers presented their results at the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunisation meeting of October 2014 in the session ‘Meningococcal A conjugate vaccine impact and routine immunisation schedule in infants and young children’ \(5.1\). The study results were cited in the WHO 2015 Meningococcal A conjugate vaccine updated guidance on the use of meningococcal conjugate vaccines, and led the WHO to emphasise the importance of completing mass vaccination campaigns in individuals aged 1 to 29 years in all countries in the African meningitis belt. Based on the high level of herd immunity demonstrated by mass campaigns, the updated guidance in 2015 specifically introduced additional recommendations to those in the 2011 position paper: 

-  *That countries of the African meningitis belt complete their campaigns in individuals aged 1\-29 years and introduce 1 dose of meningococcal A conjugate vaccine at 9\-18 months of age into the routine immunisation programme within 1\-5 years following their mass campaign. A one\-time catch\-up campaign should also be conducted for birth cohorts born since the initial mass vaccination and who will be outside the target age for the routine dose.* 

-  *That periodic campaigns should be considered where routine childhood vaccination is less than 60%, to provide sufficient herd protection to protect those not immunised* \(5.2\). 

 These updated recommendations benefited the rest of the meningitis belt countries still to experience implementation of MenAfriVac via Gavi support; a further 60 million people via catch\-up campaigns in the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Guinea Bissau, Chad, Kenya \(2016\) and Burundi, Eritrea, Rwanda, and Tanzania \(2017\) \(5.3\). 

 In 2018, a WHO task force was established to develop a global roadmap for how to control and defeat meningitis by 2030, with LSHTM representation from Greenwood and others in their capacity as experts. The roadmap set out a call to action to improve prevention and epidemic control of meningitis, disease surveillance and treatment, support for patients, and advocacy and engagement, and in 2020 the World Health Assembly approved the roadmap and adopted a new resolution to defeat meningitis within the decade \(5.4\). 

 **Mass rollout of the vaccine** 

 A review by the WHO of country reports on MenAfriVac and routine WHO immunisation data showed that by the end of 2018, 304.9 million people in 22 of 26 meningitis belt countries had received MenAfriVac through mass campaigns. By the end of 2018, a total of 8 of the 26 countries had introduced MenAfriVac into their routine immunisation programmes including 7 with catch\-up vaccinations for birth cohorts born after the initial roll\-out: Ghana and Sudan \(2016\), Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Mali and Niger \(2017\), and Côte d’Ivoire \(2018\). The Central African Republic introduced MenAfriVac into its routine immunisation programme immediately after the mass 1\- to 29\-year\-old vaccinations in 2017 so no catch\-up was needed. The Gambia and Nigeria ran catch\-up campaigns in 2019 before introduction into routine immunisation. \(5.3\) 

 **Targeted approach led to herd immunity** 

 By targeting over 227 million 1 to 29 year olds between 2010 and 2018, the mass vaccination campaigns helped to bring about herd immunity in the 26 countries of the meningitis belt. Serogroup A meningitis virtually disappeared in all areas where the vaccine was given, with the primary cause of epidemic meningitis, the group A meningococcus, practically eliminated from the entire region. In vaccinated populations, confirmed group A diseases incidence was reduced by more than 99% \(5.5\). It was estimated in 2015 by the Centre for Global Development that 142,000 young lives were saved, around 284,000 permanent disabilities avoided, and more than 1 million meningitis cases prevented \(5.6\). MenAfriVac was also featured in the ‘Millions Saved’ project in the published book *Millions Saved: New Cases of Proven Success in Global Health*, as a case study of a remarkable result developed from strategic partnerships, innovative technology, and a drive to end the cycle of disease. 

 Gavi disbursed USD367 million to meningitis A programmes for campaigns and an emergency stockpile of the vaccine, offering financial support to countries integrating MenAfriVac into childhood immunisation programmes. The mass vaccination campaign cost USD1.40 per person, and it is estimated that MenAfriVac achieved a cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year \(DALY\) averted of USD96.36, confirming its cost\-effectiveness. 

  

 While deployment of MenAfriVac may have eventually occurred in the African meningitis belt without the MenAfriCar research, the research of LSHTM and partners significantly contributed to the accelerated rollout and scale up of this vaccine, and continued global elimination efforts, as recognised by the WHO \(5.7\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Public interest and understanding in neuroscience has been significantly enhanced as a result of Anil Seth’s research in consciousness science. Tangible outcomes have been generated for a diverse range of stakeholders on a global scale: Internationally acclaimed new artworks directly informed by Seth’s research have been created which have been seen by audiences of over 800,000 people across the globe since 2018; young people have been inspired to reconsider their assumptions about consciousness and to take up new career directions in response to Seth’s work, and clinicians, wellbeing advisors and mental health service users have used his research to motivate new approaches in mental health. Broadcasters and film makers have directly drawn upon Seth’s research to help them engage their audiences more effectively, citing his multi\-disciplinary approach, and his ability to clearly explain complex material, as critical to engaging public interest and increasing understanding in this rapidly\-evolving but still somewhat inaccessible scientific field. Seth’s 2017 TED talk has drawn over 11 million views to date and has been cited by TED’s CEO as one of the most significant additions to their science coverage, playing an important role in helping TED fulfil its core mission of spreading good ideas. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Seth has pioneered multi\-disciplinary research in consciousness science for nearly two decades. Since 2000 he has published >160 journal papers, has an *h*\-index of 65, and in both 2019 and 2020 was recognised as a Web of Science ‘highly\-cited researcher’ – recognising a sustained contribution over 10 years within the top 1% of researchers internationally. The impact of Seth’s public engagement is substantially underpinned by his scientific work examining the neurocognitive basis of conscious perception and conscious selfhood. Seth is recognised for his seminal contributions to advancing scientific understanding of conscious perception as a kind of ‘controlled hallucination’ in which the brain’s top\-down predictions about the world \(and the body\) are reined in – ‘controlled’ – by bottom\-up sensory signals. He has developed this framework in a rich variety of ways. In one example, he has authored an influential theory of ‘perceptual presence’ **\[R1\]** which explains why perceptual experience normally \(but not always\) has the quality of being ‘real’. This account of perception clarifies why the colours associated with a condition called ‘grapheme\-colour synaesthesia’ \(in which letters elicit additional perceptions of colour\) are not experienced as being part of the real world. Seth and his team have additionally shown how this form of synaesthesia can be acquired through intensive cognitive training **\[R2\]**, revealing a previously unknown potential for the plasticity \(‘changeability’\) of adult perceptual experience. 

 Seth and his team have also developed innovative virtual reality methods; for example, using deep neural networks to simulate biologically plausible and highly immersive ‘hallucinatory’ perceptual experiences **\[R3\].**  This approach provides a new tool to explore why some clinical conditions are associated with distinctive visual hallucinations, and links machine learning to cognitive neuroscience to shed light on the neural mechanisms that underlie both visual hallucinations and normal, everyday perceptual experience. 

 Seth’s best\-known research, however, lies in his influential theories of what it means to be a ‘conscious self’. He has developed a much\-cited model of experiences of emotion and of ‘body ownership’, based on predictive perception **\[R4\].** This research inspired innovative virtual reality experiments that have shown how basic aspects of conscious selfhood depend on predictive integration of signals arriving from both inside and outside the body **\[R5\].** Another pervasive aspect of the conscious self is the experience of the passage of time. Recently, Roseboom, Seth, and colleagues have developed an innovative ‘clock\-free’ model of human time perception, which showed that subjective time perception is fundamentally related to changes in the content of awareness, substantially reframing scientific understanding of human time perception **\[R6\].** 

 Overall, Seth’s research has exposed how conscious experiences are built from different kinds of perceptual predictions and, as such, directly scaffolds his public engagement activities. Seth’s theories of perception and of self\-awareness have shaped debates in areas including artificial intelligence and medicine \(neurology and psychiatry\), and have helped incorporate spiritual and contemplative traditions, including mindfulness, within a scientific outlook.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Seth’s research has made a significant contribution to enhancing public understanding of consciousness science, delivering tangible benefits for a broad and international community of audiences, educators, artists, students, broadcasters and practitioners. His work and engagement activity have demystified a subject previously considered arcane, resulting in millions more people now thinking about, and actively engaging with, the subject of consciousness science in new and creative ways. 

###  **Increased engagement and improved public understanding of consciousness science** 

 A headline example of the extensive reach of Seth’s impact is his main\-stage TED talk “Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality” recorded in Vancouver, in 2017. The talk, which drew on his research \(on perception as controlled hallucination\) as a central narrative, was exceptional even by TED standards: it has >11 million views \(30/01/21\), was rated as one of the 14 most popular TED talks of 2017, features in TED’s playlist of 10 most popular science talks and has been translated into 26 languages **\[S1\]**. David Biello, TED’s science curator, describes Seth’s TED talk as “the best neuroscience talk I’ve ever had the privilege to work on.” He adds: 

 “The hardest problem in neuroscience is explaining it in a way which is simple but scientifically accurate and also engaging. I can say that Anil’s success in achieving this is reflected in the enormously high engagement with both the TED talk and his personal appearances for TED. His TED talk is among one of the most viewed in recent history and one of the most talked about TED talks for those who attended in person \[…\] TED’s relationship with Anil is ongoing and extremely beneficial to us.” **\[S2\]** 

 Importantly, by engaging such a large audience with his research, Seth is also contributing to TED meeting its strategic objectives. Biello confirms: 

 “Anil’s work has helped us meet our mission at TED in two key ways… Firstly our motto at TED is “Ideas worth spreading” and I would say Anil’s original approach to consciousness is one of those ideas worth spreading… Secondly, my goal as TED science curator is to demystify science or reduce the barriers so people are less intimidated by science and are less dismissive of their ability to grasp truly scientific concepts. I think Anil hits the marks on both those fronts for us, which explains why his talk is so popular”. 

 Chris Anderson, TED CEO, further underlines Seth’s impact: 

 “Over the years, we’ve invited many speakers to seek to address the mystery of consciousness. Anil Seth’s talk \- and follow on podcast \- may be the best contributions we’ve ever had on this topic."" **\[S2\]** 

 Selected comments \(out of >13k: 30/01/21\) beneath YouTube’s presentation of Seth’s TED talk, indicate the extent to which viewers are inspired by his ideas, prompting them to engage in debate and think differently. Key topics for lengthier debate were drugs and mental health, and memorable statements within the talk: “I really connected with what he was saying \[…\] Highly recommended; Wow\! This changes everything\! \[…\]; One of the best Ted talks I’ve seen; Actually I now wish to study neuroscience.” **\[S3\]** 

###  **Enhanced broadcast/media coverage of consciousness science** 

 Broadcasters have reported increased capacity to engage their audiences in the subject of neuroscience as a result of Seth’s research and outreach. According to BBC science correspondent Adam Rutherford, Seth’s clarity and accessibility in being able to convey his research to lay audiences make him an invaluable resource for science broadcasters. Rutherford regularly uses Seth as a contributor on the BBC Radio 4 programme *Inside Science,* which typically has \~1.7 million listeners, including around 100K downloads per episode: 

 “Anil Seth is my go\-to person for anything relating to artificial intelligence or cognitive neuroscience. Until recently, dealing with the nature of consciousness has been the preserve of philosophy, and Anil is one of a few people to investigate this subject from a cognitive psychology and neuroscience point of view. This is one of the reasons why we at the BBC return to him repeatedly... because we know we will get a clear discussion of complex ideas that our audiences will understand.” **\[S4\]** 

 This view is confirmed by Oscar\-nominated, Emmy\-award\-winning film maker, Lucy Walker, who has used Seth as a key scientific advisor in a major upcoming 4\-part Netflix series on the nature of psychedelics, where Seth’s research expertise is helping Walker to fulfil a public education remit within a popular documentary format: 

 “We felt the audience could understand these really challenging concepts if Anil were guiding them through these complex ideas. He is a really good explainer in this particular field of neuroscience and we researched lots of different people. In fact there is no\-one else we are speaking to in this capacity anywhere else in the world.” **\[S5\]** 

 Walker is clear that it is not solely Seth’s presentation and accessible manner which makes him such an important contributor, but also the significance of his underpinning research, which is changing scientific understanding of the nature of consciousness: 

 “The nature of our project is very much about public education and science education, and it’s very challenging do this in documentary form because you have to get crafty about how you do public awareness and public education in a way which is exciting enough that people tune into a TV series in their millions. Anil’s research is really at the forefront of this revolution of ideas \[…\] and so you need someone like Anil who straddles all these fields to be able to illuminate these concepts for us.” **\[S5\]** 

###  **Shaping artistic practice through consciousness science** 

 The multi\-disciplinary nature of Seth’s research into consciousness has directly inspired new generations of artists to think and respond artistically in new and creative ways. This is exemplified by Refik Anadol **,** a US\-based Turkish media artist who was awarded **The Lorenzo il Magnifico Lifetime Achievement Award for New Media and Installation Art in 2019,** and was chosen to be a featured artist opening the Venice Biennale in 2020. Anadol describes his recent work in VR as being fundamentally grounded in Seth’s research: 

 “Anil Seth’s hallucination concept or consciousness concept was very inspiring to me when I was thinking about machine learning algorithms… I found his research to be an essential support to these speculations… In particular I was inspired by Anil’s research in my project called *Machine Hallucination* in which I’m exploring synaesthetic architecture.” **\[S6\]** 

 *Machine Hallucination* was a large\-scale immersive work by Anadol which used the largest data set ever gathered for an artwork, in which machine learning algorithms processed over 100 million publicly\-available photographs of New York City **\[S6\]**. *Machine Hallucination* showed at ARTECHOUSE in New York and had 110,000 visitors between Sept 2019 and Feb 2020. The resonance of Seth’s ideas to new forms of architecture is also highlighted by Neil Leach, a British architect and Visiting Professor at Harvard. Leach says: “Anil’s work has completely transformed my thinking. I have recently completed the manuscript of a book, *Architecture in the Age of AI*, and have dedicated a whole chapter to AI and Neuroscience, drawing heavily on Anil’s ideas. I also show my students Anil’s TED talk each semester.” **\[S7\]** 

 New exhibitions, theatre and music have also been created as a result of Seth’s research. For example, Seth was the primary science advisor to the year\-long exhibition **,** States of Mind: Tracing the Edges of Consciousness* at the Wellcome Collection in London \(Oct 2015 \- Oct 2016\). The exhibition, which included a synaesthesia\-training exhibit directly based on his research, attracted >264,000 visitors, with print highlights, feature pieces and reviews of *States of Mind* being circulated in most major national newspapers and science magazines, together reaching an estimated 7 million readers \(Wellcome Trust estimate **\) \[S8\].** As part of his Wellcome Trust Engagement Fellowship, he collaborated with award\-winning US\-based educational rap specialist, Baba Brinkman, on *The Rap Guide to Consciousness* \(2017\). This show was directly inspired by Seth’s research on predictive perception, dating from a talk he gave in Tucson in 2016 **\[S9\].** Brinkman describes how the show brought specific themes from Seth’s research to completely new audiences *:* 

 “I found the field of ""predictive processing"" particularly well\-suited to theatre and music, and as a narrative device that you can use in live performance, because of their experiential engagement…. Anil’s research ended up being highly integrated into *The Rap Guide to Consciousness*.” **\[S9\]** 

 About 8,000 people over 2 years have seen *The Rap Guide to Consciousness* live, including 85 live performances ‘off Broadway’ in New York **\[S9\]**. “Every single night had a Q&A so that’s a lot of people learning about and being exposed to the ideas of neuroscience who might not have been otherwise.” **\[S9\]** Brinkman also notes that his own artistic practice has been changed as result of engaging with Seth’s work: “the things I have learnt from Anil Seth have caused me to rethink my entire artistic practice… Incorporating predictive processing theory has given me a whole new vocabulary about how a performance works, and how I interact with and perceive my audience.” **\[S9\]** Videoed audience interviews collected from some of the 4700 people who bought tickets for Brinkman’s show in New York feature comments such as “world\-changing”, “enlightening” and “educational” indicating that the work has indeed been successful in stimulating public understanding and interest in the nature of consciousness **\[S9\].** 

###  **Inspiring young people and influencing their life choices** 

 Young people aged 11\-25 have been particularly inspired by Seth’s research, as feedback questionnaires collected by his research group demonstrate. His multi\-disciplinary approach has particularly resonated with this demographic, for example: “I was surprised to learn how many different areas of study \(maths, philosophy and IT\) are involved in neuroscience \[…\]” **\[S10\]**. His use of creative and diverse techniques to conceptualise consciousness have demonstrably helped young people to develop an understanding of subjects that had previously seemed obtuse: “His use of accessible concepts including optical illusions, visual illusion and synaesthesia helped me understand the ideas he was explaining…” **\[S10\]**. For many, this experience has been of life\-changing significance, as a selection of extracts from feedback received from young people reveals: “learning about Anil’s research was probably one of the biggest events impacting the way I see the world in my early teenage years” … “It immediately changed how I perceived the world” **\[S10\]**.  “Anil’s work inspired me to get into the field of neuroscience, which has now led me to a PhD in clinical psychology…” “\(his work was\) inspiring a change in direction towards research surrounding consciousness and its practical applications, particularly in treating mental health problems and the future of AI” **\[S10\].** 

 The success of Seth’s wide\-reaching communication of the science of consciousness is reinforced by the response to his piece on predictive perception written for the online magazine, *KidSpirit.* A worldwide jury of children voted the article as the best of 2019; Seth’s award was voted for by 75 children aged 11\-17 who form the *KidSpirit* editorial world – these children come from many different countries, and often from underprivileged backgrounds **\[S11\]**. Seth travelled to New York to accept the award and to spend a weekend mentoring these children. Elizabeth Hochman – founder and executive director of the KidSpirit online magazine and community – commented on the unprecedented impact this had on these young people: 

 “How many of those kids from all over the world would have ever encountered some\-one with Anil’s expertise? None of them I imagine. Especially when you consider the diverse backgrounds of the kids we work with. The kids that encountered Anil were blown away by his ideas … that has been life changing for these kids, I would say **” \[S11\]**. 

###  **Benefits to clinicians and mental health service users ** 

 Seth’s research on consciousness has also changed lives and altered clinical practice in areas of physical and mental wellbeing. Following his TED talk, respondents included representatives from the health sector and people struggling with dissociative disorders or bereavement. Selected responses indicate the effect on individuals’ mental health: “My perspective has been changed and I feel like in some way my healing has begun“ \[ **S3**\]; “Anil’s work has also helped me to better understand and so better cope with Major Depressive Disorder. Understanding how my brain works has been fundamental to my mental health” **\[S10\].** Examples also encompass clinical practice: Michael Garrett, Head of Clinical Psychiatry at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, New York, has been using Seth’s TED talk as a clinical intervention with psychotic patients who are experiencing auditory hallucinations. The results have been so positive that Garrett is planning to expand this into a research project exploring the utility of an individualized “Seth demonstration” as part of the treatment of selected psychotic patients. **\[S10\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Snakebite has historically been perhaps the most under\-researched, under\-resourced high mortality and high morbidity neglected tropical disease. The research and advocacy activities of Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine \(LSTM\) have impacted three key areas: 

1.  defining the burden of and consequences of the problem, permitting increased funder and policymaker focus on snakebite \- this directly led to the World Health Organization \(WHO\) formally classifying snakebite as a priority Neglected Tropical Disease in 2017 and, in 2019, establishing a strategy \(co\-written by LSTM scientists\) to halve the global snakebite mortality and morbidity by 2030; 

1.  design and implementation of a model intervention program, ensuring the delivery of significantly improved snakebite therapies \(antivenoms\) to countries in West Africa – this resulted in new, cost\-effective, life\-saving treatments; 

1.  securing the supply of quality antivenoms by developing a ‘prequalification’ programme for ensuring the quality of snakebite therapeutics for Africa; this in turn has resulted in direct commercial impact for antivenom manufacturers. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Snakebite is a medical emergency and the world’s most lethal neglected tropical disease. Snakebite predominately affects poor rural populations of the tropics and results in approximately 138,000 deaths and approximately 400,000 disabilities per annum. Snakebite has long been neglected by funders and policy makers, which has resulted in only limited investment and funding. Studies led by LSTM have revealed the true burden of envenoming and have led to more efficacious, safer and affordable snakebite therapies. 

 Impacts have been achieved in collaboration with the University of Kelaniya in Sri Lanka, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health and Bayero University of Kano, Nigeria and, more recently, from the 96\+ researchers that LSTM has gathered for snakebite clinical and public health research in Nigeria, Kenya, eSwatini and India. 

 **Quantifying the burden of disease** 

 LSTM\-led research has been central to the international effort to increase awareness of the substantial disease burden posed by snakebite worldwide. Lalloo coordinated the highly influential publication estimating the global burden of snakebite, snakebite envenomings and snakebite deaths based on literature analysis and modelling \[1\]. Harrison and Lalloo next demonstrated that snakebite is a disease of rural tropical poverty by evidencing clear associations between snakebite mortality and key economic and socioeconomic indices of poverty \[2\]. Lalloo’s later publication \[3\] was the first to demonstrate that snakebite also causes severe chronic psychological morbidity. 

 **Laboratory and Clinical Evaluation of Antivenoms** 

 The EchiTAb Study Group was established by LSTM and partners in 2006 and led by Theakston and Harrison as a response to the international crisis in the supply of effective antivenom for African snakebite victims, first highlighted by Theakston \[4\]. This collaboration of scientists, physicians, antivenom manufacturers and Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health representatives was funded by GBP1,920,000 from the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health \(between 2006 and 2012\). The EchiTAb study group focussed on mitigating snakebite mortality and morbidity in West Africa. Medically\-important snakes were exported from Nigeria and housed at LSTM where research on the venoms was performed. LSTM designed and delivered venom mixtures for antivenom production by manufacturers in UK, Costa Rica, Egypt, Colombia and Mexico. LSTM then preclinically tested the efficacy of the resulting 5 antivenoms. Of these new antivenoms, 3 were submitted to \(i\) phase I clinical dose\-finding and safety studies \(resulting in the deletion of 1 product with an unacceptable safety profile\) and \(ii\) a randomised controlled double\-blind non\-inferiority study of the remaining 2 antivenoms in Nigeria conducted between 2005 and 2007. This resulted in demonstrable efficacy and safety for both products \[5\], and remains the largest clinical trial undertaken on snakebite to date. Harrison and Casewell also demonstrated preclinical efficacy of these products against other snake species to which the antivenoms were not originally designed, thereby advocating for their broader clinical use across sub\-Saharan Africa \[6\]. 

 The initiation, funding, coordination, development, testing and delivery of the EchiTAb antivenoms exemplifies LSTM’s ‘bench to bedside’ research philosophy and capability. Other studies have been key in improving patient outcomes related to how antivenoms are used. Lalloo co\-designed and ran a major clinical trial in partnership with the University of Kelaniya demonstrating that severe, potentially life\-threatening, antivenom reactions could be decreased by 25% using adrenaline \(epinephrine\) prophylaxis \[7\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Positioning snakebite as a priority neglected tropical disease** 

 LSTM has been central to the international effort to increase awareness of the substantial disease burden posed by snakebite that culminated in the WHO recommendation that snakebite be listed as a priority neglected tropical disease. We organised highly influential international meetings that raised the global profile of snakebite, including the Wellcome\-funded ‘ *Mechanisms to reverse the public health neglect of snakebite victims*’ 2015 meeting chaired by Harrison \[1\], and the 2016 Kofi Annan Foundation meeting, also organized and chaired by Harrison, in which Mr Kofi Annan declared snakebite as “ *the biggest public health crisis you’ve never heard of* ” \[2\]. In 2018, Casewell co\-organised the Dutch Government funded “ *Snakebite: from science to society*” international meeting that brought over 300 individuals \(scientists, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, public health practitioners, charities, policy makers, governments and funders\) together to discuss solutions for tropical snakebite \[3\]. These meetings were instrumental in effecting change in international health policy. Initiatives resulting from this series of meetings include, WHO’s 2018 listing of snakebite as a priority NTD \(see below\), the 2019 WHO strategy to halve snakebite mortality and morbidity by 2030 co\-authored by Harrison and Lalloo \[4\] and Wellcome’s 2019 investment of GBP80,000,000 in snakebite research. 

 The 2017 WHO recommendation that snakebite be listed as a priority neglected tropical disease. was ratified by the World Health Assembly in 2018 \[4\] and has galvanised action from several governments. For example, the Kenya Ministry of Health NTD department has established a Snakebite Task Force, which includes a LSTM\-research collaborator \(Dr George Omondi\) in its membership, and written national guidelines \[5\], that LSTM and its Kenya partners are delivering to hospitals and communities across Kenya. While awaiting full impact assessments, we have already observed increased hospital admission of snakebite victims \(Kitui County\) and demand for antivenom from Ministries of Health \(Kitui & Baringo Counties\). 

 LSTM has led many other advocacy activities that have improved global recognition of the public health burden posed by snakebite including advising and participating in numerous documentaries with a global reach between 2013 and 2019 for the BBC, BBC World, Discovery Channel, China Global Television Network, Natural History Museum and Royal Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene \[6\]. In particular, Harrison had extensive input into the development of a documentary with the Lillian Lincoln Foundation entitled “ *Minutes to Die*” \[6\] which highlighted the plights of victims and the scientists seeking to redress the issue. 

 In 2018, LSTM was a main partner with the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene in the development of the inaugural International Snakebite Awareness Day. This initiative included participation from the Wellcome Trust, the Global Snakebite Initiative, Medecins Sans Frontiers, the Kofi Annan Foundation and Health Action International. Casewell and Harrison filmed a short documentary film on snakebite and contributed to the recording of BBC World visual and audio documentaries on snakebite in Kenya, both of which were used in the inaugural event in London \[6\]. Casewell’s co\-written opinion piece for the general public on the BBC News website in 2019 “Why are so many people still dying from snake bites?” \[6\] has been viewed over 500,000 times. 

 **Improving snakebite therapies** 

 The EchiTAb Study Group activities resulted in the development of two new, efficacious, safe and cost\-effective antivenoms that received National Marketing Authorisations from the Nigerian National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control \(NAFDAC\), in 2005 \[7\]. A two year evaluation on the impact of the introduction of these antivenoms into Nigeria, conducted between 2009 and 2010, found snakebite mortality decreased from 35\-45% in the absence of antivenom to 1.52% after the venom was introduced \[8\]. In addition, the dose of antivenom required with the new therapeutics was decreased from 6 vials to between 1 and 3 vials, compared with previous products \[8\], thereby also resulting in a decrease of at least 50% to the cost of treatment to impoverished victims and the health system. Our in\-country partners indicate that these pre\-REF 2021 efficacy, cost\-effectiveness and mortality\-reduction figures have remained constant thereafter and the EchiTAb antivenoms remain the standard of care in Nigeria and other countries \(see below\). 

 Our findings that adrenaline prophylaxis can reduce severe reactions to antivenom led to the routine recommendation of adrenaline prophylaxis in WHO guidelines in 2016 \[9\]; adrenaline is included as a strong recommendation in almost all national snakebite guidelines. The routine use of adrenaline prophylaxis has been reported to be associated with reduced mortality from snakebite; some clinicians avoided antivenom use because of their fear of reactions and being able to prevent or manage reactions using adrenaline increased the use of life\-saving antivenom \[10\]. 

 **Enabling access to antivenom** 

 As a result of our advocacy on the need for quality assurance processes, WHO have established an ‘antivenom prequalification’ process, by which independent risk benefit analyses following robust laboratory assessment of available antivenoms are performed to ensure the quality of snakebite therapeutics for Africa \[11\]. The EchiTAb Study Group\-developed antivenom EchiTAbG, manufactured by MicroPharm Limited, was the first product to receive WHO\-approval via this process in 2019. 

 The EchiTAb Study Group project also resulted in commercial and reputational benefits to the antivenom manufacturers. Thus, the SME, MicroPharm Limited \(UK\) benefitted from \(i\) 5 years investment in their production of EchiTAbG, \(ii\) ownership of a brand that is now the standard snakebite treatment throughout Nigeria and neighbouring countries, and \(iii\) an Africa\-antivenom production reputation that resulted in its selection to sustain the production/delivery of FavAfrique from Sanofi \(2019/20\). Similarly, based upon the success of its antivenom \(EchiTAb\-Plus\) in Nigeria, the Costa Rican antivenom manufacturer, Instituto Clodomiro Picado \(ICP\), is now distributing EchiTAb\-Plus to many other countries, including Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana, Central African Republic and irregularly to other West African countries. While no formal epidemiological studies have quantified the impact this antivenom has had in these countries, the similar pattern of snake envenoming and well documented challenges with poor quality or non\-availability of antivenom make it highly likely that there has been a decrease in mortality of at least 33%, as observed in north\-east Nigeria \[8\]. The EchiTAb Study Group project has since become recognised as a model for north\-south and south\-south collaboration for delivery of significantly improved snakebite therapies to tropical countries in greatest need \[12\]. Indeed, using the ‘EchiTAb’ model, ICP has established similar new partnerships in Sri Lanka \(\~2014\-2018\) and Papua New Guinea \(\~2012\-2016\) to deliver new life\-saving antivenom products to market in these resource\-poor, high snakebite burden, areas \[12\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In an increasingly interconnected, globalised world, the ability to operate effectively across different cultures is critical to building business, political and diplomatic bridges. Professor Helen Spencer\-Oatey and Dr Daniel Dauber have conducted research into intercultural competence, particularly within the context of increased internationalisation of higher education. Via the development of new tools, resources and training materials, the research has improved the cultural competencies of students, graduates and employees, supporting the creation of culturally\-agile citizens who are better equipped for this new globalised world. Their research has enhanced the internationalisation strategies of universities and created new ways to benchmark and evaluate progress against them. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the past three decades, the number of international students worldwide has increased from 0.8 million in 1975 to 4.1 million in 2010 and continues to rise. Universities in most regions of the world are trying to maximise the benefits from this by formulating internationalisation strategies. Yet this raises some fundamental questions around their goals for internationalisation and achievement of those goals. According to the Organisation for Economic Collaboration and Development's \(2018\) Global Competence Framework, university graduates need to have the skills and qualities to \(a\) live harmoniously in multicultural communities and \(b\) thrive in a changing labour market. Since 2009, Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber's research has focused on this facet of the internationalisation of higher education. Their research has brought new insights into the identification of the key skills and attributes needed for this, how those skills and attributes can be developed, the educational environment that can foster them, and the extent to which such an environment is being provided by universities and taken advantage of by students. 

 **Conceptualisation of the skills and attributes of 'global graduates'** 

 Despite numerous models of intercultural competence, there was a need to move beyond broad categories, such as 'good at communicating across cultures', to the identification of specific skills that are important for intercultural communication and that can be used to help students develop their competence in communicating effectively and appropriately in intercultural contexts. Spencer\-Oatey's research into different communication patterns and styles and into rapport management \(e.g. **R3.1** and **R3.2**\) led to the specification of a number of key elements \(e.g. handling turn\-taking; giving negative feedback without causing offence\) and has subsequently fed into the development of training resources, including Working in Diverse Groups. 

 **Conceptualisation of the educational environment that can foster 'global graduates'** 

 Conceptual and empirical research by Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber \(e.g. **R3.3, R3.4, R3.5** and **R3.6**\) revealed the importance of 'mindful interaction' for fostering 'global graduate' skills and attributes. This entails students being sufficiently motivated to move out of their comfort zones, engage in experiences of difference, and reflect carefully on those experiences. The same research indicated that there were 'student silos' and that the increasing diversity of students on university campuses was not necessarily leading to greater 'mindful interaction' among students. This led Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber to seek an evidence\-based picture of the situation and to develop a tool that could provide it. 

 **Development of a profiling tool with an empirically robust conceptual foundation** 

 Several organisations \(e.g. Times Higher, QS\) publish worldwide rankings of universities for internationalisation, but their criteria are all demographic/structural in nature \(e.g., number/proportion of international students and staff, and the amount of outward/inward mobility\) and provide no information on the development of the global graduate skills and attributes identified by Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber's research. Other surveys \(e.g. National Student Survey, Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey\) are unsuitable because they do not incorporate an international element. Although i\-graduate – one of the world's major players in running surveys in the HE sector – offers a relevant survey, the \(International\) Student Barometer ISB/SB\), it only includes one or two questions on friendships. 

 To address this need, Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber designed an internationalisation KPI tool, the Global Education Profiler \(GEP\). To understand how 'global graduates' can be fostered, their research focused on the contexts and factors that help nurture such competence. They analysed: \(a\) what universities are providing to encourage the development of global graduate skills and attributes, and \(b\) the extent to which students are engaging with such opportunities. They identified five core constructs: social integration, academic integration, communication skills, foreign language skills development, and global opportunities and support. Ten items were written to probe each construct, with each item being rated twice on different Likert scales: 'importance to me' and 'my actual experience', so that both attitude and experiential engagement could be probed. After initial pre\-piloting, they ran the GEP at six different universities in 4 different countries, and statistical tests confirmed that the constructs are both valid and reliable. They then started running the tool on a larger scale and analysing the findings \( **R3.7**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact on individual universities' internationalisation strategies and initiatives** 

 The internationalisation KPI tool, the Global Education Profiler \(GEP\), **\[E5.1\]** has been used by 22 universities over the assessment period in the following countries: Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Spain, the UK, and Uruguay. It is the only strategic planning tool available to Higher Education institutions that moves beyond structural and compositional benchmarking and provides a meaningful measure of global skills growth. Each university had their own context\-specific purposes for running the GEP but, in all cases, it enabled them to gain an institution\-wide picture of their strengths and weaknesses in internationalisation. Many used these insights to plan initiatives and improvements. At Durham University, the Dean for Internationalisation 2015\-2018, was ""impressed by the level of detail that we might be able to glean from the GEP survey which focused on the gap between student expectation and experience over a number of areas key to our strategy \(especially social and academic integration, and global opportunities and support\)."" Durham used the GEP in 2017 and the data “helped us become more aware of the impact that different levels of diversity across departments and Colleges was having on student integration and their opportunities to develop global skills."" On the basis of this finding, the University adjusted its recruitment strategy, and this led to a greater range and spread in student diversity. In addition, the GEP data led to a refresh of the Durham Award, which recognises student skills development. The GEP results were used to inform the design of the new Durham Inspired Award, launched in September 2019 with 800 students registered in 2020. **\[E5.2\]** The University of Padua used GEP findings to inform staff internationalisation training in the summer of 2020. The Italian university also used the results to underpin a consortium tender to the European Commission regarding initiatives to promote global and intercultural learning. **\[E5.3\]** 

 **Impact on the development of university students' intercultural skills** 

 Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber's research insights into the nature of global graduate skills and ways of fostering them have been applied to the design of training resources and an e\-course on intercultural awareness/skills which have been used to underpin training across the University of Warwick, and at other universities in the UK, Hong Kong, Sweden and Switzerland. 

 At Warwick, there has been a year\-on\-year increase in participants, reaching nearly 1000 in 2018\-19. Over the programme, participants recorded a 12.7% increase in their intercultural competence. Feedback comments included: ""I was able to recognize myself in all of the different sections and become more aware of the way I communicate and interact with others. The content of the course really made me more conscious and aware of these behaviours and patterns therefore, I will be more capable of adapting. I have definitely gained analytical skills to understand communication better."" **\[E5.4, E5.5\]** 

 The Deputy Head of the International Office at the University of Applied Sciences, Northwestern Switzerland, said that the e\-course had challenged students to reflect on how they were handling particular situations: “In my experience, they often underestimate the impact of cultural differences in intercultural teams, since they all identify themselves as young, open\-minded, well\-travelled global citizens. There is also an understandable reluctance to ‘rock the team boat’ and potentially endanger the project outcome. As an intercultural coach, it is important, however, to encourage students to stretch and grow and learn. Here the e\-course content helped greatly.’’  **\[E5.6\]** 

 The training aspect of Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber's work was cited in the Russell Group January 2018 response to the Migration Advisory Committee's commissioned report into the impact of international students in the UK. They referred to the importance of intercultural training to maximise the benefits of cultural diversity and used Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber's research as an example of best practice. **\[E5.7\]** 

 **Impact on internationalisation benchmarking and policy\-making at network, national and supra\-national levels** 

 The GEP was selected by the Coimbra Group \(a consortium of renowned European universities\) for internationalisation benchmarking purposes following a presentation by Spencer\-Oatey to rectors and vice\-rectors of the Coimbra Group, which involved detailed discussions on ways of profiling internationalisation 'performance'. As a result, the Coimbra Education Executive Board \(EEB\) contracted with i\-graduate to run the student and staff versions of the GEP at member universities. Their network\-level insights have enabled them to \(a\) benchmark internationalisation across a significant number of European universities in their network, \(b\) take the lead in promoting best performance in internationalisation within Europe, and \(c\) demonstrate to the European Commission \(EC\) the network's forefront role in achieving this. The anonymous benchmarking is allowing them to assess competencies and develop strategic policies to enhance internationalisation across their network. Thirteen universities participated in phase 1, and further universities are expected to participate in phase 2. Initial findings were presented to the EEB in early September 2019 and attendees reported being particularly impressed by two elements: \(a\) the role of the GEP in identifying and elucidating areas of underperformance, and \(b\) the value of this for planning policy development. Full benchmarking results from Phase 1 were presented at a high\-level Coimbra network event in Tartu in December in 2019 \(attended by Gyula Cserey, Deputy Head of Unit, Higher Education, EC\) and this was followed up by a presentation in Brussels to the DG Education, Youth, Sport and Culture of the EC at the end of January 2020. Chair of the Coimbra Group wrote: “Institutions may undertake formal student surveys and evaluations, but these very rarely probe deeply into questions on academic and social integration, language skills, intercultural competence, and opportunities to study or work in another country or culture. Another important, but often neglected, area to survey on internationalisation is the perspectives of staff as educators and administrators. We selected the GEP as the best available tool of its kind to help our members benchmark in key areas of internationalisation.’’ **\[E5.8\]** 

 Within the UK, Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber were invited to have a one\-hour discussion on 10 October 2019 with Jack Thomlinson \(Senior Policy Advisor\) and Gemma Turnbull \(Senior Policy Advisor International Education\) from the Department for Education about ways of implementing the government's internationalisation strategy, including possibilities for benchmarking or developing a kitemark. **\[E5.9\]** 

 **Impact on a commercial company** 

 i\-graduate is part of the Tribal Group, which offers products and services to the education sector. Tribal Group’s Marketing Business Partner said licensing the GEP from the University of Warwick in 2016 fitted well with its portfolio of evidence\-based global solutions and services. “In particular, it gave us further opportunity to use our survey experience to gather and analyse data in the area of internationalisation, and subsequently align i\-graduate with this evolved view of the internationalisation agenda.’’ Since licensing the GEP, the company has collected data on internationalisation from over 26,000 students and staff who are studying/working in universities across 14 \(primarily European\) countries. Tribal Group added: “Globally, the student experience, both for domestic and international students, is central to the majority of Higher Education institutions’ strategic decision making processes and, as a result of using the GEP, we as an organisation are able to understand the student experience in an increasingly evidence\-based, objective and comprehensive manner. This has meant that we are more effective in helping those operating in education. 

 “Our customers have cited the value of using the GEP in a range of applications: on an ongoing basis to evaluate the effectiveness of new internationalisation strategies; to benchmark internationalisation across their networks of institutions; to assess and benchmark performance in internationalisation; and to aid the development of students in culturally diverse universities.’’ \[ **E5.10\]** 

 **Impact on global skills for the workplace** 

 In mid/late 2019 Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber received requests for a comparable tool to the GEP with a greater workplace focus. This led them to develop and successfully pilot the Global Fitness Profiler \(GFP\), which has a three\-pronged focus: two developmental factors \(the organizational context and employee engagement\) and a suite of intercultural competence outcomes. A Chinese electronics company, Oppo, piloted the GFP across one of their departments and found the feedback very valuable, commenting that the GFP ""has made us more confident over our team's future development"" while it also ""allowed us to identify areas needing further development"". **\[E5.11\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Changes in energy markets impact all energy consumers – large and small – and regulatory bodies are in place to protect their interests: ensuring fairness, efficiency, and security of supply. Professor Banal\-Estanol’s research on how wholesale electricity and gas markets function and the effects of the incorporation of new renewable technologies has: \(i\) influenced government regulatory and policy decisions in the UK and across Europe, and \(ii\) informed investment decisions on new technologies in the private sector in Spain. His expertise on competition policy and emissions\-reducing technologies has also been applied in the landmark EU\-wide truck\-makers’ cartel prosecution and cited in litigation. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Energy is an “essential service” for homes and businesses across Europe. In Britain alone, households and businesses together spend around  [£55 billion on energy each year](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/state-energy-market-2019), according to Ofgem \(The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets\). Professor Banal\-Estanol’s research has developed techniques and concepts for understanding how energy markets operate and can be made more efficient. Using theoretical, numerical and empirical methods, his research examines four overlapping areas relating to market regulation and competition including the effects of introducing renewable energies. 

 **\(i\) Market power and efficiency in wholesale gas markets** 

 Over the last two decades, there have been structural and regulatory reforms to make the European natural gas industry competitive and to ensure a secure supply of natural gas. Wholesale markets for natural gas \(the “gas hubs”\) emerged, connected by a pipeline network, such as the “Interconnector” pipeline linking Belgium and the UK. This line of research, initiated with Professor Banal\-Estanol’s PhD student at City, University of London, Olivier Massol, examined the performance of the gas hubs, the spatial arbitrage between hubs and the effects of mergers between hub participants \[3.1, 3.2\]. The research, which took place from 2016\-19, used an innovative methodology, capable of breaking down the observed spatial price differences into factors such as transportation costs, transportation bottlenecks and the imperfect nature of the competitive behaviour of the arbitrageurs. It also confirmed that the remedies imposed by the European Commission may have done more than simply mitigate the potential anticompetitive effects of mergers – they may have effectively created competition. 

 **\(ii\) Agent\-based simulations of price and efficiency in wholesale energy markets** 

 Traditional economic models, which to a large degree are based on highly stylised, analytically tractable models, are not always suitable for studying the problems in energy markets. This research, carried out from 2007\-11 with Banal\-Estanol’s long\-time co\-author Agusto Ruperez Micola, developed and implemented agent\-based simulation models to investigate and improve the efficiency of liberalised energy markets. They focused mainly on the horizontal and vertical relationships between gas and electricity markets, diversification of electricity generation portfolios and the effects of the introduction of intermittent renewable technologies \[3.3, 3.4\]. Technological diversification, as well as the introduction of low\-cost intermittent renewable technologies, were shown to yield lower wholesale electricity prices. 

 **\(iii\) Technologies to reduce greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions from the power sector** 

 Hydrocarbon fuels dominate the global primary energy mix and are major carbon dioxide \(CO2\) emitters. This line of research \(carried out from 2015\-18\) studied the benefits and costs of introducing technologies that reduce greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions into the electricity sector. Professor Banal\-Estanol, together with Dr Massol and others, studied the price effects of introducing wind and solar generation. He studied the institutions and combination of policy efforts involved in extending electricity coverage – including the promotion of renewable energies that can reduce the costs of electrifying rural areas – as well as the remaining obstacles, at policy and institutional levels, to achieving full coverage \[3.5\]. These insights have informed expert contributions on sustainable cities, including the report “Shaping the Cities of Tomorrow: Renewable Energies and Sustainable Urban Ecosystems”, which was produced with support from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe \(UNECE\). This showed that private firms and communities can collaborate with governments to develop small\-scale, localised energy generation systems, both in rural and suburban areas: the adoption of renewable energies has emerged as a cost\-effective solution around the world. 

 **\(iv\) Competition policy implications of information sharing** 

 Professor Banal\-Estanol has also studied the causes and consequences of information sharing among competing firms \(from 2006\-07\). Most of the literature has assumed that firms have perfect knowledge about market conditions. In practice, this is rarely the case. For instance, vehicle manufacturers do not have information about the costs \(or the demand\) for the introduction of emission technologies for trucks, and the passing on of these costs on the prices faced by their competitors. This line of research studies the effects of information sharing on prices and the corresponding consequences of mergers on social welfare \[3.6\]. Provided that the industry is not highly concentrated, information sharing via for instance mergers, even between competing firms, was found to reduce prices and boost social welfare.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The contribution of Professor Banal\-Estanol’s research to the understanding of competition and regulation in the energy markets is demonstrated primarily through his advisory roles to business and government agencies. His expertise in modelling and understanding the market, established through his academic publications, and his own efforts at outreach – the World Bank and African Forum for Utility Regulators uses his work for teaching and he delivers executive training courses on competition and regulation – mean that he is in high demand among policy makers and in legal and regulatory fields. 

 **\(i\) Influencing government regulatory and policy decisions** 

 Changes to the UK energy market have implications for every consumer connected to the distribution network – whether they are a small domestic household or a vast industrial user. Independent regulatory bodies are in place to protect their interests. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets \(Ofgem\) regulates the monopoly companies which run gas and electricity networks, with their stated aim “to protect consumers now and in the future by working to deliver a greener, fairer energy system”. The Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\) works to promote competition for the benefit of consumers, both within and outside the UK. 

 Professor Banal\-Estanol’s research led directly to his appointments to the academic panels of the CMA in 2016 and Ofgem in 2017 \[5.1\]. Ofgem adopted the analysis framework he developed to evaluate the performance of the “gas hubs” \[3.1, 3.2\] – the wholesale market for natural gas. The Energy Act 2013 introduced a number of reforms to further ‘shake up’ the energy market, including new Capacity Market Auctions, set up to incentivise investment in sustainable, low\-carbon electricity capacity at the least cost to energy consumers. The analysis of interaction between the wholesale market and the Capacity Market revealed that Early Auction reduced the spread between peak and base prices by £0.66/MWh \[5.2\]. The methodology from \[3.1\] was directly applied to this work; as Ofgem’s Chief Economist confirms, “Banal\-Estanol’s contribution \[was\] of great value and was particularly important to our review of the impact of the Early Capacity Market Auction announcement on wholesale electricity prices and revenues” \[5.1\].  Additionally, Ofgem produce two annual reports to provide “current and clear analysis” on the impact of their policies: Consumer Impact and the State of the Energy Market. Professor Banal\-Estanol was invited to provide advice on the analysis and draft of the State of the Energy Market Report 2017 \[5.1\] and he is personally thanked in State of the Energy Market Report 2017 – Technical Appendix \(Footnote 1\) for his contribution \[5.2\]. Subsequently, this document has been used on an international basis by The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission \(ACCC\). It is cited over thirty times in their report  [International Experiences in Retail Electricity Markets](https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Appendix%2011%20-%20The%20Brattle%20Group%20-%20International%20Experiences%20in%20Retail%20El....pdf), which focuses on improving the effectiveness of retail electricity competition in Australia’s National Electricity Market \( [NEM](https://www.energy.gov.au/government-priorities/energy-markets/national-electricity-market-nem)\).  The energy market reforms in Australia will come into play from 2025. 

 As a member of Ofgem’s Academic Panel, he has also been involved in key decisions and was commissioned to write reports to adjust the new regulatory framework, RIIO \(Revenue = Incentives \+ Innovation \+ Outputs\), which was first introduced in 2013 and determines the allowed gas and electricity transmission and distribution charges across England, Scotland and Wales. He commented on a preliminary document entitled “Returns adjustment mechanisms in RIIO price control”, published as the “RIIO\-2 Framework Consultation” \[5.3\] which subsequently involved key stakeholders across the whole of Great Britain. Under the RIIO price control framework, the eight\-year price control settlement included a number of uncertainty mechanisms, one of which was the mid\-period review \(MPR\) of outputs. Professor Banal\-Estanol was invited to submit a literature survey on “Regulatory risk and the cost of capital”, focusing on matters which impact the security of electricity supply for consumers in England, Scotland and Wales, as well as the allowable revenue for the 14 Distribution Network Operators \(DNOs\) – totalling hundreds of millions of pounds. According to the former Chief Economist at Ofgem \(2016\-2020\): 

 “This review enabled the Ofgem team to assess whether the potential benefits to consumers from reducing returns to companies was outweighed by a systematic uplift in the cost of capital for regulated companies. \[It\] found that the impact of these risks should they materialise was sufficiently significant to outweigh any short\-term consumer benefits. This literature survey went on to form part of an Ofgem Impact Assessment for Distribution Network Operators in 2018 \[5.4\], which was an important part of the evidence for Ofgem’s decision not to extend the scope of the MPR”. \[5.1\] 

 Furthermore, research output \[3.2\] was integral to the first analysis of the competition policy decisions undertaken by the European Commission’s Directorate General in Competition \(DG Comp\), in which Professor Banal\-Estanol acted as a technical expert. His co\-authored report, “The economic impact of enforcement of competition policies on the functioning of EU energy markets” \(2016\), was cited as part of the Impact Assessment in a Commission Staff Working Document which proposed new “Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council” for the electricity market \[5.5a\]. The Impact Assessment claims that one of the main problems is that “Retail markets for energy in most parts of the EU suffer from persistently low levels of competition, consumer choice and engagement” \[5.5a, p.4\]. It goes on to cite Banal\-Estanol’s report, saying that it “includes an assessment of the intensity of competition in the energy markets \(both wholesale and retail\) and points out that, between 2005 and 2012, the intensity of competition in European energy markets may have declined” \[5.5a, p.32\]. The resulting EU directive \(2019/944\) \[5.5b\] has now come into force, with the aim to ensure affordable wholesale and retail prices and a smooth transition towards a sustainable low\-carbon energy system. It lays down key rules relating to the organisation and functioning of the EU electricity sector, in particular rules on third\-party access to transmission and distribution infrastructure and unbundling requirements. The directive provides a framework for Member States to enact its requirements into national law. 

 **\(ii\) Informing investment decisions in the private sector** 

 Professor Banal\-Estanol has used the knowledge acquired through his research \[3.3\] to \[3.6\] to inform decision\-making as a member of Som Energia, a Spanish not\-for\-profit green energy consumer co\-operative. He was invited to join the co\-operative’s Governing Council in January 2018 and became President in July 2020. Som Energia’s main activities are the production and sale of renewable energy \(i.e. sun, wind, biogas, biomass\) and social innovation. They are committed to driving change in the current energy model to achieve a 100% renewable model and to reducing energy poverty. During 2019, Som Energia – which was established in 2010 – marketed 32% more electricity compared to 2018 and has achieved a co\-operative membership of 70,000 people and 125,000 electricity contracts. They have been directly involved in a new, multi\-million euro investment programme designed to expand the production of energy from wind and solar technology, whilst continuing to promote initiatives, such as electric vehicles, car sharing, and sustainable transport. Chief Executive Officer, Marc Rosello, reports that as a result of Professor Banal\-Estanol’s direct involvement since 2018, Som Energia has achieved: 

 \(i\) “An improvement in the performance of the business through the introduction of improved processes and services, as shown in the 2019 business performance measures of turnover of 67 million euros, net profit of 1 million euros, 70 full\-time employees. 

 \(ii\) Better access to financial opportunities as shown by the 4.75 million euros raised \(in a single day\) in the form of voluntary contributions to share capital to reinforce cooperative activity and promote the construction of a new solar plant in Llanillos \(Granada, Spain\), which will have an estimated production of 7 GWh per year, equivalent to the energy needs of approximately 2800 households. 

 \(iii\) Reduced carbon emissions through an annual production that has reached 18.5 GWh of renewable energy. Given that emissions avoided per GWh by using renewable technologies instead of coal equate to 2 million tonnes, this means that approximately 37 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year have been prevented. 

 \(iv\) Social benefit to several local communities, evidenced by the “Germinador Social,” an initiative that aims to stimulate the creation of innovative social models through a competition open to all” \[5.6\]. 

 As a result of this work, in February 2020, he was invited by the European Climate Foundation, an international philanthropic funder, to produce an analysis of the role of natural gas in the energy transition in Spain, focusing particularly on a policy analysis of the country’s Liquefied Natural Gas \(LNG\) infrastructure compared to that of France and the UK \[5.7a\] and was awarded €15,000 grant funding to complete the study \[5.7b\]. He was also invited to join a panel of experts on the ‘Foro de Alto Nivel Transicion Energetica Justa e Inclusiva’ \[Forum on Fair and Inclusive Energy Transition\] which was set up by Teresa Ribera, Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition, launched in October 2020. Its purpose is to seek expert advice on the best use of Spain’s resources, as part of the Government’s Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan \[5.8\]. 

 **\(iii\) Application in an EU\-wide manufacturing cartel prosecution** 

 This third impact example brings together previous streams of work into a new type of impact on the law which is cited in court judgements. Because of his work on the consequences of information sharing between competing firms on prices \[3.6\] and his broader expertise in competition policy and on emission\-reducing technologies, Professor Banal\-Estanol was appointed an independent expert to estimate the cartel damages on vehicle prices \[5.9\]. 

 Since January 2019, Banal\-Estanol has been acting as an expert witness in litigation in Spain, following the EU Commission’s landmark decision on the truck makers’ cartel. This decision imposed the largest ever EU antitrust fine on a pan\-European 15\-year exchange of sensitive information, as well as delays to the introduction of new emission\-reducing technologies for medium and heavy trucks. In practice, this meant that in July 2016, the EU Commission fined six manufacturers of medium and heavy\-duty trucks \(Man, Volvo/Renault, Daimler, Iveco, Daf\) over €2.93 billion, with a subsequent fine of €880 million for Scania in September 2017. Following this decision, thousands of companies that had purchased, leased or rented trucks have filed actions against the manufacturers throughout Europe asking for compensation for damages. According to Dr Simone Kohnz, Director, E.CA Economics: 

 “Professor Banal\-Estanol has co\-authored a report for E.CA Economics estimating infringement damages in Spain, which has already been submitted in over 900 cases. He has so far appeared in more than 50 court proceedings all over Spain \(e.g. Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia … San Sebastian and Girona\). His contribution has been of great value in these cases and has been particularly important for the assessment of damages by the Spanish courts” \[5.10\]. 

 As this case will set a precedent throughout the EU, in addition to giving evidence in court, Professor Banal\-Estanol’s expertise is likely to be cited in other jurisdictions throughout Europe as this case is litigated in other national markets.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 
Digital fictions use digital technologies to tell stories. Professor Alice Bell’s research on the production and reception of digital fictions examines their history and investigates the cognitive processes involved in reading them. The Opening Up Digital Fiction project has generated and informed new digital fiction by both professional and novice writers; opened up digital fiction to nearly 2,500 people at events across 5 countries; and has significantly increased the use of and expanded provision for digital fiction in galleries and libraries in England, Wales, Ireland, Norway and Portugal. The research has provided an original and uniquely immersive means of preserving and archiving digital fictions at immediate risk of loss through technological obsolescence. The project has reached school children of all ages, pre\-school children, teachers, gallery, museum, and library visitors, fiction writers, software and web developers, librarians, archivists, and curators including at the British Library and the National Library of Wales. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Digital fiction is specifically written for and read on a computer \(e.g. desktop, smartphone, tablet\) and requires reader interaction \(e.g. clicking a mouse, following a hyperlink, controlling an avatar\). This often means that readers can make choices about their journey through the text and/or influence the story in some way. Most digital fiction uses text alongside sound, image, and film and are published as CD\-ROMs, web\-based hypertext fictions, interactive apps for mobile devices, narratively\-driven videogames, and Virtual Reality. 

 Since 2003, Professor Alice Bell's research has investigated the production and reception of digital fiction. Her work in transmedial narratology and stylistics \[ **R1**, **R2**\] examines the way that digital media can be harnessed to tell stories. This includes analysing the way that text, sound, and image can be used in combination as well as medium\-specific forms of interactivity such as hyperlinks which allows readers to make their own way through a multilinear narrative. This research documents an important moment in cultural history by examining the formal characteristics and continually emerging technologies of which digital fictions are built including the ways in which external technological changes can lead to their obsolescence. 

 A second strand of Bell’s work examines how readers cognitively process digital fictions \[ **R3**, **R4**\]. Working within the discipline of cognitive poetics, which investigates how readers process language in literature, Bell’s work is unique in using insights from the cognitive sciences, digital media theory, and stylistics to account for the way that readers process digital fiction specifically. Within this context, Bell’s reader response research \[R5, R6\] has also empirically investigated immersion and interactivity in digital fiction in both private and public spaces \(e.g. galleries\). From 2014\-17, Bell was PI for the £243,000 AHRC\-funded Reading Digital Fiction project, collaborating with digital media theorist Professor Astrid Ensslin \(Alberta\), creative writing scholar Dr Lyle Skains \(Bangor\), and Post\-Doctoral Researchers, who were recruited to the project, Dr Jen Smith \(Hallam\) and Dr Isabelle van der Bom \(Hallam\). 

 Synthesising empirical research with public engagement, Bell led the development of the project’s new participatory research methods. These practice research methods both underpinned and reciprocally drew on the project's public engagement activities, whereby participants both benefitted from and contributed to the research. Participants read works of digital fiction individually and subsequently discussed their responses during interviews and reading groups. The participants' verbal responses were then linguistically analysed to identify the readers' emotional, spatiotemporal, and interactional relationship to those texts. The research has resulted is an empirically based understanding of the way that readers cognitively process multimodal, interactive, and immersive features in digital fiction \[R5, R6\], influencing the way that authors produce their works of digital fiction. While existing research characterised engagement in print literature and videogames as a complete and totalising relocation to a fictional world, Bell’s research demonstrates that engagement with and/or immersion in digital fiction is usually an intermittent and hybrid experience. The research has found empirical evidence of the movement of attention between different forms of verbal, aural, and visual media. The research has also shown how extra\-textual features, such as the environment in which the digital fiction is experienced, can affect the reader/players’ absorption in and response to the narrative.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Opening Up Digital Fiction has resulted in the production of new works of digital fiction, expanded digital provision in libraries and galleries, increased the number of people reading digital fiction internationally, and saved digital fiction works from obsolescence. 

####  1. Influencing digital fiction production and supporting new forms of artistic expression 

 Bell’s research on the reader’s experience of interactivity and immersion has influenced the production of digital fiction, leading to the creation of new works and expanding digital fiction authorship. Since 2015, Bell has worked as a research consultant with Dreaming Methods, a leading digital fiction production company, to support new forms of literary expression. Bell and Dreaming Methods were awarded an GBP8,000 research grant from Sheffield Hallam University to produce a new piece of digital fiction called *WALLPAPER* which would draw on and inform Bell and colleagues’ AHRC\-funded empirical research. Described by leading international gaming magazine, PC Gamer, as ‘a very cool thing’ \[ **E1**\], *WALLPAPER* sold 198 copies \[ **E2**\], was exhibited to 700 people in Sheffield, Wakefield, and Oslo \[ **E3**\] and generated new empirical findings on immersion \[ **R5**\]. This research was also applied by Dreaming Methods in the development of further work including a Virtual Reality version of the original *WALLPAPER* piece. As Creative Director/CEO of Dreaming Methods states, the research has ‘contributed significantly to the direction of our work’ by ‘influenc\[ing\] how we balance text\-based content with other rich media, design and develop methods of navigating works, and evaluate reader/player reactions, particularly through public engagement’ and in gaining ‘a deeper understanding of how our future narrative experiences might best be developed’ \[ **E2**\]. 

 Bell and colleagues launched the Opening Up Digital Fiction Writing Competition in 2017. As the only digital fiction competition in the world aimed at both established and novice writers, it encouraged more writers to experiment with digital media and inspired the production of new cultural artefacts, with 110 digital fictions submitted from 24 countries \[ **E4**\]. The awards ceremony was streamed and archived online and 23 shortlisted and 5 winning works are published indefinitely on the RDF website \[ **E5**\]. Commenting on the diversity of the submissions, a competition judge concluded that ‘the shortlisted works truly show how digital fiction can be opened up to new writers and audiences’ \[ **E4**\]. The competition is now a bi\-annual international event attracting 57 entries from 9 countries in 2018. It was postponed in 2020 due to COVID\-19 but submissions are live for 2021 \[ **E5**\]. 

 The competitions were supported by 9 writing workshops and artist talks for 641 adults and 17 children in Sheffield, Wakefield, Bournemouth, Cork, and Porto \[ **E3**\] which were co\-designed and led by the project researchers and Dreaming Methods. The researchers also published resources online, available internationally \[ **E5**\]. In addition to significantly increasing digital fiction production and expanding digital fiction authorship, this writing programme influenced creative practice \(e.g. ‘I know how to create a story with digital fiction’\), increased knowledge of and confidence with software \(e.g. ‘I learned about working on various platforms, using images, sounds and video’\), and inspired participants to use their new skills in other contexts \(e.g. ‘I might consider this as a job’; ‘I would like to use \[the software\] for care home residents to create memory box stories’\) \[ **E4**\]. 

####  2. Expanding audience reach, increasing cultural participation, and influencing professional practice 

 Bell’s research \[ **R1\-R6**\] formed the basis of 49 public engagement events \(including 20 workshops, 11 lectures, and 8 exhibitions\) with extensive reach in England, Wales, Norway, and Portugal and which have led to permanent changes to library and gallery provision and practice. 

 Led and delivered by Hallam colleagues and Dreaming Methods, the events were attended by 2,394 adults and 70 children \(aged 0\-16\) \[ **E3**\] and have resulted a 153% increase in participants' knowledge about digital fiction and significant increases in confidence with digital technology \(88% of exhibition visitors\) \[ **E4**\]. Bell developed a pathway with 46 reading group participants whose discussions were subsequently used in Bell’s empirical research \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. 

 Events were aimed at audiences who would not otherwise be exposed to digital literary culture including: literary festivals \(e.g. Oslo Poesifilm festival 2017\), games festivals \(e.g. Games Britannia Videogames Education Festival 2017\), humanities festivals \(e.g. Being Human 2017\), and art galleries \(e.g. The Art House, Wakefield\). 

 Three websites \( [<ins>www.readingdigitalfiction.com</ins>](http://www.readingdigitalfiction.com/);  [www.wallpaper.dreamingmethods.com](http://www.wallpaper.dreamingmethods.com/);  [<ins>https://digitalfiction.co.uk/</ins>](https://digitalfiction.co.uk/)\). extended the international reach of the project further, alongside an online exhibition of 26 works with associated critical commentaries. As of 10 December 2020, the websites have received 115,644 visits from 156 countries including the Philippines \(34%\), UK \(24%\), USA \(14%\), Brazil \(4%\), Canada \(4%\), and India \(2%\) \[ **E2**, **E6**\].  Participants gained a fresh perspective on literary fiction \(e.g. “'\[The exhibition\] *has completely opened my eyes to a whole new world of literature*”\), felt motivated to read more \(e.g. ‘ *I will seek out interactive fiction\!*’\), engaged in debate \(e.g. ‘ *I’m taking away a lovely memory of a fine conversation and a richer understanding of the work’*\), and established new cultural ventures \(e.g. ‘ *Going to start a book club’*\) \[ **E4**\]. 

 Events were held in venues that had not engaged their users with digital fiction before including holding the UK’s first ever exhibition of digital fiction at Bank Street Arts in Sheffield in 2014 which attracted 443 visitors over 3 weeks and involved professional development training delivered by the researchers for 10 gallery staff \[ **E3**\]. The CEO of Bank Street Arts reflects that the collaboration 'required a significant learning curve for the gallery staff' \[ **E9**\] and provided 'the opportunity to actively and directly participate in research as a real partner' \[ **E2**\]. This led to the increase in visitor numbers and made a significant commercial impact to the gallery, allowing it to continue operating. As Clark reflects, ‘I don’t think \[Bank Street\] would have existed without \[the *WALLPAPER* exhibition\]’ \[ **E7**\]. 

 Collaboration with libraries locally and nationally also expanded the digital content of and increased access to their provision. From 2014\-2017, Bell and colleagues delivered 3 professional development workshops to 15 librarians at the National Library of Wales and Sheffield City Library with 3 events subsequently codesigned and delivered to 52 children \(aged 0\-6\). In Sheffield, this led to permanent changes to 3 programmes: the use of digital stories and resources in the monthly Bookstart Early Years \(0\-5s\) and the annual Summer Reading Challenge \(ages 0\-8\), and the incorporation of digital fiction in after school Code Clubs \(ages 9\-11\) held in libraries across the city \[ **E2**\]. 

####  3. Preventing technological obsolesce and preserving digital literary heritage 

 Bell’s research has saved digital fiction produced in Flash from being lost. Her work shows that many important works from the 1990s/2000s were produced in Adobe Flash software \[ **R2**\]. In December 2020, Adobe withdrew Flash from web browsers, meaning that digital fiction works made in Flash disappeared. Anticipating the devastating impact that this universal technological change would have on digital fiction, Bell led the Digital Fiction *Curios* project – collaborating with Dreaming Methods from 2018\-20 – to preserve, archive, and maintain access to Flash based fiction. Defined by the British Library as a ‘playful and innovative approach to preserving digital works’ \[ **E8**\] the *Curios* provides a new methodology for preserving Flash content and, to date, has saved 3 key works from being lost. Unlike other solutions to Flash obsolescence, *Curios* provides a playful, engaging, and aesthetically rich Flash archive. Utilising Bell’s findings on immersion \[ **R5**\], the Curios project is designed to encourage more intuitive and creative engagement with the Flash archive through an immersive Virtual Reality \(VR\) rendering of a curiosity shop, accessible to experienced and novice users of VR. Readers’ access to and engagement with the Flash fiction archive is thus as interactive, immersive, and entertaining as the Flash texts themselves. Readers also have access to interactive learning resources within the *Curios* such as analyses of the works and artists’ lectures. 

 *The Curios* has been downloaded 109 times \(as of 10 December 2020\) \[ **E2**\] and presented to 653 writers, curators, archivists, and software developers at 5 events internationally \(e.g. the 10th New Media Writing Prize\) \[ **E3**\] including to 24 curators, archivists, and preservationists from the British Library as part of their Twentieth\-First Century Curatorship series. The Digital Preservationist for the Electronic Literature Organization, which has been promoting and preserving digital fiction and poetry worldwide for over 30 years, states: “ *The need for this project is urgent … \[Curios\] ensures that future generations will have access to this treasure trove of late 20th century and early 21st century digital literature*.” \[ **E2**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by staff in the School of Biosciences at the University of Kent resulted in the formulation and ratification by the NHS of new clinical guidelines for the care of total laryngectomy patients. Following initial implementation of the guidelines in the East Kent NHS Trust, analyses showed that the new treatment regime led to a 2.7\-fold increase in the lifespan of patients’ voice prostheses on average. This clinical advance maintained the patients’ ability to speak for longer, reduced infection rates, and enhanced patients’ quality of life – ‘a game changer’, as one patient put it **\[b,f\]**. In addition, since publication in 2016, the guidelines received recognition across the UK, and have been requested by other NHS Trusts, with four Trusts \(UCL, Bristol, Leeds, and Cornwall\) confirming that they were using the guidelines to benefit from their ‘significant impact on clinical practice’ **\[c\]**. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Background** 

 Total laryngectomy is the surgical removal of the larynx, usually to treat cancer, and is performed on 450 patients per annum in England, with an estimated 135,000 procedures occurring worldwide. During the procedure, a silicone voice prosthesis \(VP\) is inserted to enable the restoration of speech. Eventually, the VP will fail, resulting in oesophageal contents leaking into the airway, thereby increasing the risk of chest infection. Prostheses require replacement due to failure on average every three months, although in some cases failure occurs as often as every two to three weeks \(‘early failure’\). VP replacement results in the temporary loss of speech, and requires day surgery visits to specialised speech and language nurses or consultants. Early failure therefore not only reduces the patients’ quality of life, but also requires significant NHS resources. That is, at the outset of this study, VP management had an estimated annual cost to NHS England in excess of £7 million, based on an average cost associated with four changes per patient per annum, and excluding medical costs associated with secondary chest infection. 

 **Research** 

 Dr. Gourlay and Prof. Mϋhlschlegel have been working in the field of yeast genetics and medical mycology for 20 years, culminating in the establishment of the Kent Fungal Group \(KFG\) at the University of Kent in **2008**. The international reputation of the KFG led to them undertaking a project that sought to tackle the problem of early failing VP with the aim of improving patients’ lives while reducing cost to the NHS. The project began in **2012** when clinicians from the East Kent Hospital University Foundation Trust \(EKHUFT\) who managed total laryngectomy patients approached Gourlay and Mϋhlschlegel as members of KFG. The EKHUFT team asked for assistance to determine the reasons for VP failure using a research\-based approach. In **2012,** a formal multi\-disciplinary team was established in partnership between EKHUFT and the University of Kent. Funding from the Kent Cancer Trust, EPSRC, National Biofilm Innovation Centre, and Kent Health supported three University of Kent PhD studentships \(Daniel Pentland, Viktorija Makarovaite, Aaron Hillier\), and has since led to further, ongoing collaborative research projects with University of Kent staff Prof. John Batchelor \(Radio Frequency Identification Detection \[RFID\] of microbial contamination of VP, **\[R6\]**\) and Dr Simon Holder \(development of new anti\-fouling materials to prevent VP contamination\). 

 The initial phase of research undertaken by the multi\-disciplinary team, led by Dr Gourlay and using samples provided by the EKHUFT partners, demonstrated that the effects of high levels of CO2 \(as are found in the airway where the VP is situated\) stimulate *Candida albicans* growth and biofilm formation **\[R5\]** via pathways that had earlier been elucidated by the Mühlschlegel group **\[R1, R4\]**. These findings led the multi\-disciplinary team to develop the hypothesis that VP colonisation by *Candida* species was responsible for early VP failure. To test this hypothesis, the Gourlay lab evaluated clinical microbiology data from early failing VP, again provided by the EKHUFT partners, from patients in East Kent across a seven\-year period \( **2012\-18\)**. These data confirmed the implication of *Candida* in VP failure **\[R5\]**. Between **2014** and **2016**, the multi\-disciplinary team devised clinical guidelines to treat *Candida* growth on VP that were communicated widely to the professional community. This included a report in the official magazine of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists \(October **2016**, pp. 12\-14\) and presentations at national and international conferences, including the British Association of Head and Neck Oncologists Annual Meeting in **2019**. Thirty\-eight patients were followed as part of a trial that documented VP lifespans before and after implementation of treatment guidelines. This validated the *Candida* management guidelines as highly effective, demonstrating an average VP lifespan increase of 2.7\-fold **\[R5**\]. This is the most significant increase in VP lifespan reported worldwide to date. Further research developed novel RFID diagnostic technology to detect biofilm formation on VP in the human body in real time **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The University of Kent’s novel, evidence\-based research on *Candida* biology and the effects of colonisation of this organism on VP lifespan **\[R1\-6\]** resulted in the development of a novel clinical pathway that generated a diversity of clinical, patient, professional service, and industrial impacts between **2016** and **2020**. 

 **Advancing Clinical Guidelines** 

 In **December 2016**, the University of Kent’s treatment guidelines for management of *Candida* colonisation on VP were ratified and published by the NHS **\[a\]**. The guidelines were designed using University of Kent research **\[R5\]** that directed the use of specific anti\-fungal drugs to effectively prevent the formation of a biofilm on the VP. The application of the medication was designed to be carried out at home by patients. Clinicians applying these guidelines consider them a step change in clinical practice, as evidenced in letters of support from EKHUFT \(guidelines are ‘a significant contribution to medical practice’, and have made ‘a great deal of difference to how we treat patients’ **\[b\]**\); UCL Hospitals Foundation Trust \(‘significant impact on clinical practice’ **\[c\]**\); Bristol NHS Trust \(the guidelines ‘facilitate best clinical practice and patient care’ **\[d\]**\), Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust \(attesting to the guidelines’ ‘positive impact on our clinical approach’ **\[e\]**\); and Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust \(‘really informative and helpful in guiding practice within our department’ **\[f\]**\). EKHUFT clinicians also confirm how essential the partnership with the Kent team was for development of the guidelines, stating: “It is safe to say that, without the research expertise that you offered \[…\] the changes in our approach to management of voice prostheses, that have had such a positive impact on medical practice, would not have taken place’ **\[b\]**. 

 **Informing Clinical Practice** 

 The guidelines were initially \( **2016**\) implemented in EKHUFT **\[b\]**, one of the largest Hospital Trusts in England who typically have about 40 laryngectomy patients in any one year. As a result of the multi\-disciplinary team working to disseminate the research findings through publications and conferences to engage the professional community, access to the guidelines was requested by additional NHS Trusts across the UK. EKHUFT were unable to provide details of the requesting Trusts to the Kent team due to privacy laws, although their letter of support confirms that the guidelines ‘most gratifyingly, have also led to other NHS Trusts adopting our Candida management protocol’ **\[b\]**. EKHUFT approached other NHS Trusts to ask whether they felt able to provide further evidence on the effect of the pathways on their clinical practice. Despite the fact that these efforts coincided with the onset of the Covid\-19 pandemic, which significantly reduced the responsiveness of NHS Trusts, we received replies from four Trusts, all sent since **2016** and confirming that they have begun using the Kent guidelines to inform treatment of their own patients in the time period between their publication in **2016** and the end of **2020**. In detail, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust confirmed that ‘The guidelines have offered us a great source of reference and as a result we have initiated a multi\-disciplinary team \(MDT\) that engages microbiology, ENT and speech and language therapy’ **\[c\]**. University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust confirmed that ‘we have modified our treatment protocol in accordance with your management guidelines’ **\[d\]**. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust confirmed that ‘your research has had a positive impact on our clinical approach to the management and care of voice prostheses in patients’ **\[e\]**. Royal Cornwall NHS Trust confirmed that ‘we have received and are making use of your clinical guidance on the management of Candida colonisation of voice prostheses’ **\[f\]**. As stated above, clinicians from all these trusts evaluated the guidelines as having a positive impact, similar to the EKHUFT clinicians who were part of the original study. 

 The guidelines also attracted international attention, with both a health trust in Australia and Freudenberg Medical in the US requesting access to the guidelines **\[g\]**. 

 **Improving Patient Outcomes and Wellbeing** 

 The application of the *Candida* VP management guidelines increased VP lifespan by 2.7\-fold on average **\[R5\]**, thereby reducing the frequency of adverse effects such as loss of speech and increased infection, which are associated with VP failure and VP replacement. Overall, the guidelines have therefore translated into an improved quality of life for the patients. As reported by ‘Mick’, one of patients in an interview with ‘Leila’, a speech and language nurse and member of our multi\-disciplinary team: ‘Every morning I gently brushed a little medication around the inside of my prosthesis, it was really easy to manage. Having my prosthesis changed so much was a real pain as my throat is so sensitive that it would really make me cough. The longer I can make them last the better. The care I have received has been out of this world, and, because of people like Leila, I absolutely love my life’ **\[h\].** 

 **Enhancing Charitable Work of the Kent Cancer Trust** 

 The Kent Cancer Trust, a Charitable Trust with the aim of enhancing cancer patient care in Kent, became involved as co\-funders of the project in **2015**. The Trust commend the ‘success that was achieved with the Laryngectomy project’ **\[i\]**, and describe the important role successful projects of this nature play in enabling further fundraising rounds for them **\[i\]**. Specifically, they state that the success of the laryngectomy project ‘has been publicised in our web site and is discussed in some detail in a wide\-ranging TV interview organised by KMTV that is hoped to be screened later this year \[…\]. lndeed the success that was achieved with the Laryngectomy project has led to further funding for the Tracheostomy project that builds on the learnings from the earlier project \[…\] and that too provides further helpful marketing support for our charity’ **\[i\].** 

 **Enhancing the IP portfolio of industrial partners** 

 As a direct result of the research project, the Kent researchers \(involving additional partners from Kent’s Schools of Engineering and Physical Sciences\) established a new collaboration with Smiths Medical International, a manufacturer of medical devices, with the aim of developing voice prostheses that can sense biofilms *in situ* and in real time. The new collaboration has attracted EPSRC \(EP/N009118/1\) and BBSRC National Biofilm Innovation Centre \(002POC19105\) funding, thereby bringing new research resources and new research directions into the company. In **2017**, initial results on the detection of biofilm growth on surgical tubes using RFID technology were subject to a patent application listing Smith Medical and members of the University of Kent team as co\-inventors **\[j\]**, thereby strengthening the IP portfolio of the industrial partner.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Globally, more than 200 million people with incontinence depend on technology to manage their condition. University of Southampton \(UoS\) research has led to novel sustainable continence products, online support tools and development of standards that have improved the lives of people with incontinence worldwide by: 

 **Increasing user confidence in product choice and access to products:** 1\) The *Continence Product Advisor* website, co\-created by UoS, has had more than one million visits worldwide and is a core component of a professional development massive open online course \(MOOC\) with users in 119 countries. 2\) New International Organization for Standardization \(ISO\) and World Health Organisation \(WHO\) standards shaped by UoS research have given lower income countries sustainable access to products that were previously unavailable or too expensive. 

 **Providing sustainable product choices for intermittent catheter users:** Novel intermittent catheter cleaning methods have expanded options beyond single\-use plastic catheters for users worldwide by enabling CE marking of 1\) the first biodegradable, reusable intermittent catheter for women and 2\) a biodegradable, biocidal wipe effective at decontaminating intermittent catheters. 

 **Improving options for convenient, safe use of male incontinence devices:** UoS researchers have designed a reusable penile compression device and produced evidence\-based guidance to help thousands of men worldwide manage post\-prostatectomy incontinence. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Estimates of urinary incontinence in the UK alone indicate that as many as six million people are affected. People rely on continence products and devices to manage a condition that many find difficult to talk about, and it can be challenging to identify and access products that meet their physical and emotional needs. In recent years, single\-use products, especially absorbent pads and urinary catheters, have become ‘the norm’ despite their significant environmental impact. Working with product users and carers, the Bladder and Bowel Management Group at UoS has used clinical trials, experimental methods, qualitative research and evidence syntheses to co\-design and develop sustainable technologies to improve the quality of life of people living with incontinence. 

 **Clinical trials and decision\-aid methodology: Supporting product choice, decision\-making and product development.** Since 2006, Fader has led a series of trials to assess the performance of different continence product designs. A Medical Device Agency funded trial of absorbent products for men with light incontinence \[ **3.1**\] showed substantial differences in performance between disposable and reusable products and between different designs, winning the International Continence Society best abstract award \(Montreal, 2005\). Building on this work, in 2008 Fader led a Health Technology Assessment \(HTA\) programme of three clinical trials \[ **3.2**\] comparing the effectiveness of different absorbent continence product designs for men and women at home and in nursing homes. Her research showed, for the first time, important gender preferences and highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of different designs of both washables and disposables for different needs. 

 Men’s needs were investigated further in a Prostate Cancer Charity\-funded cross\-over trial comparing the effectiveness of four product designs for men with post\-prostatectomy incontinence \[ **3.3**\]. This was the first published study to compare different continence devices for men and showed the potential value \(highly effective for leakage\) and limitations \(pain and discomfort\) of the penile compression device \(clamp\), demonstrating the need for an improved design and, unlike for many existing clamps, clear user safety guidance. The research revealed that some device designs, when compared with pads, significantly improved men’s quality of life and reduced the number of disposable pads used. Most men found a ‘mix’ of products to be more effective although they lacked information on which to base their product selection decision\-making. In parallel, and to make this and other continence product research more accessible for clinicians and product users, Fader developed the concept of an evidence\-based interactive website. This was based on the framework developed for the evidence synthesis chapter *Management with Continence Products* published by the International Consultation on Incontinence \[ **3.4**\] and co\-authored by Fader. 

 To enable users to select products most suited to their needs utilising the results of our research and to build on the findings of the male devices study \[ **3.3**\], we were awarded a programme grant \(GBP830,000\) from Movember/Prostate Cancer UK. This included funding for the first evidence –based *Continence Product Decision Aid* which Fader and Dr Cathy Murphy developed using patient decision\-aid methodology. We demonstrated that use of the tool improved user confidence in decision\-making and reduced decision conflict \[ **3.5**\] and it was incorporated into the *Continence Product Advisor.* In response to men’s need for improved information and better products \[ **3.3**\] a new prostate cancer section funded by this programme was built into the *Continence Product Advisor.* This programme also funded the development of a new clamp design as identified by our male devices study \[ **3.3**\]. 

 **Experimental laboratory work: Developing novel reprocessing methods for intermittent catheterisation.** In 2007, Fader co\-authored a Cochrane review showing insufficient evidence for any catheter design or catheterisation technique affecting the rate of urinary tract infection \[ **3.6**\]. This called into question the industry\-driven, large\-scale shift away from catheter reuse to single\-use plastic catheters, which reduced user choice and had substantial cost implications. According to the Prescription Cost Analysis, NHS spend increased from GBP13m in 2008 to GBP104m in 2018. In England alone around 75,000 plastic intermittent catheters end up in landfill every year. The Cochrane findings underpinned the award to Fader of a GBP2.4m NIHR programme grant that included a randomised controlled trial comparing single\-use catheters with ‘mixed’ use \(single\-use and multi\-use\) catheters. In preparation for the trial, Dr Sandra Wilks and Dr Jacqui Prieto developed, with patients, the first evidence\-based, reliable and practical reprocessing method based on the Milton™ cold water sterilising method. When tested with catheter users, the UoS *Multicath Milton* method removed a range of common uro\-pathogens from intermittent catheters when cleaned between uses and was acceptable to users. It allows the reuse of uncoated catheters repeatedly for up to 28 days \[ **3.7**\] and led directly to the CE marking and marketing of the world’s first reusable and biodegradable intermittent catheter \(Emteva<sup>TM</sup>\) by UK company Hunter Urology. Interviews undertaken by Prieto with 40 catheter users highlighted the benefits of choice of catheter type to users who want the convenience of a disposable catheter but also the security of a reusable one.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 University of Southampton research designed to improve quality of life for people with incontinence has benefitted: a\) patients, by increasing user confidence in and access to a wider and more sustainable range of continence products and devices, b\) clinicians, supporting their practice through evidence\-based online guidance, professional development training and the availability of new devices on prescription, and c\) policymakers, through the development of new international standards and WHO product specifications that strengthen regulation of clinical devices and widen access to quality, cost\-effective products in low\-income countries. 

 **Increased confidence in product choice and wider access to products for users, their informal carers and clinicians** 

 We pitched the concept of the *Continence Product Advisor* website to the International Continence Society, the foremost, international, multi\-disciplinary organisation for incontinence education and research \(3000\+ members worldwide\), who invested in the technical expertise to build and launch the website in November 2013. This website is the first evidence\-based, comprehensive and independent \(i.e. not industry\-driven\), multimedia resource for patients and clinicians, utilising our research \[ **3.1\-3.3,3.5**\] to support continence product selection and use. It is the only evidence\-based source of continence product advice listed on the NHS website for patients, with more than 1 million visits from men and women from more than 190 countries worldwide over the impact period. It averages more than 10,000 visitors per month. More than 890 product queries and 240 user tips have been submitted by users, informal carers and clinicians, each answered by an expert nurse \[ **5.1**\]. The website is maintained by the International Continence Society and it is a valued resource for its international membership and their patients. Its former Secretary General states: “ *The value of the website is inestimable … I find the website incredibly helpful to guide both patients and caregivers in the selection of appropriate products*.” \[ **5.2**\] Online surveys show that most users found the website ‘very helpful’ \(74%\), gaining confidence in product selection and use \(66%\) \[ **5.3**\]. Representative feedback included: “ *It is … very informative, helped me realise there are many more options to manage incontinence than I thought”* and for men preparing for surgery, *“Forewarned is forearmed … takes away some of the fear … helps you to deal with your situation more easily and confidently”.* 

 The *Continence Product Advisor* is the core component of a new education programme \(MOOC\) *Understanding Continence Promotion* \[ **5.4**\], launched in February 2019 by the UK Association for Continence Advice \(ACA\), a membership organisation for all health and care professionals, including NHS Trust continence service leads, with an interest in bladder and bowel health. The course, which offers training on how to support self\-management of continence conditions, is free to ACA members and can count as a professional development credit – although informal carers and people living with incontinence have also completed it. It has been run six times over the REF impact period, training 3622 people from 119 countries; 100% of responders to a post\-course survey reported gaining knowledge or skills and online reviews posted on the FutureLearn site gave an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.0. \[ **5.4**\] 

 Representative feedback included: “ *I think it would great if all nurses could have this introduction to what continence means, the effects it has on individuals … made me reflect on my current practice*” \(Nurse of 12 years\). “ *Made me feel like taking up nursing again*” \(Informal carer\). “ *It has enlightened me on how to treat and take care of my bowel and if there’s incontinence occurrence how to control and treat it*” \(Person living with incontinence\). \[ **5.4**\] Professor Jo Booth, MOOC Lead stated: “ *Without access to this unique resource \(Continence Product Advisor\) we would have had great difficulty in delivering the comprehensive, independent information our students need.*” \[ **5.5**\] 

 **New international standards to improve product quality, strengthen device regulation and increase access to cost\-effective, reliable continence products in low\-income countries** 

 As a result of her role in *Management with Continence Products* \[ **3.4**\] and the clinical trials \[ **3.1\-3.3**\], in 2016 Fader was invited by the International Continence Society to lead an international group of experts to develop standardised terminology for absorbent products \[ **5.6**\]. Absorbent incontinence products come in a wide range of different designs, but the variety of synonyms used to describe them are confusing for product users, clinicians, manufacturers and purchasing agencies. A new standard was needed to better reflect current product design and aid decision\-making. The outcome of the work was a new recommended terminology for all designs of single use absorbent products \[ **5.7**\]. Fader’s research influenced the International Organization for Standardization \(ISO\) when the ICS terms were adopted by ISO. Jesper Nordlinder, ISO Aids for Ostomy and Continence Committee Lead stated: “ *ISO standards are highly influential documents which are used worldwide by industry \(manufacturers of the products specified\) and key institutions involved in the procurement of products including the UK Supply Chain … Professor Fader’s research \[has\] provided her with unique expertise on the use of a wide range of products, both from a clinical and academic standpoint. Therefore, as a consequence of the close working between the two committees, her expertise influenced the ISO terminology*.” \[ **5.8**\]. 

 Fader was subsequently invited by the WHO in 2016 to develop assistive product specifications \(APS\) for disposable and washable absorbent continence products \[ **5.9**\] which utilised the new standards. The WHO Global Cooperation on Assistive Technology \(GATE\) had launched the Priority Assistive Products List, selected on the basis of widespread need and impact on people’s lives. APSs underpin the priority assistive product lists and provide a set of standards that regulate the procurement of absorbent continence products in low\-income countries. They are used by government procurement officers to guide tendering processes and inform the UNICEF catalogue. In Tajikistan for example, absorbent pads have been highlighted as the fifth most needed assistive product group. The APS developed by Fader et al was adopted onto Tajikistan’s new assistive products list in 2019 \[ **5.10**\]; this enabled procurement agencies in Tajikistan, for the first time, to purchase clinically effective, sustainable and cost\-effective continence products. Describing the UoS research contribution as ‘ *essential*’, WHO’s GATE lead said: “ *The inclusion of the specifications for absorbent continence products, developed by Professor Fader, is an important advancement for the millions of people managing incontinence with limited access to essential products*.” \[ **5.9**\] This has recently led to Fader and Murphy being commissioned by WHO to research the provision and use of washable absorbents in low income countries \(GBP60,000\). 

 **Provision of sustainable, reusable and effective options for intermittent catheter users** 

 Fader has highlighted the shortcomings of catheter design and the need for innovation in design and methods for use in various media interviews, including live appearances on BBC Breakfast and Radio 4 *Today* in 2015. The UoS group subsequently worked with a company developing a biodegradable, reusable intermittent catheter in order to reduce the use of single use plastics. The UoS *MultiCath Milton* cleaning method \[ **3.7**\] was essential in enabling the first reusable and biodegradable intermittent catheter, Emteva<sup>TM</sup> \(Hunter Urology\), to become CE marked for sale in the EU and available for patients via the UK drug tariff. Prior to Emteva, the estimated 20,000\+ female intermittent catheter users in the UK alone were confined to single use catheters. The availability of a reusable intermittent catheter to use alongside single use ones has been reported by catheter users to provide optimal choice for their physical and lifestyle needs. The CEO of Hunter Urology stated: “ *The work done by Professor Fader’s team at the University of Southampton has been essential in enabling the reusable Emteva catheter to become available to catheter users.*” \[ **5.11**\]. Around 36,000 Emteva catheters have been prescribed in England alone since 2016 benefitting approximately 9,000 women \[ **5.12**\]; they are also sold internationally, including in Denmark and Australia \[ **5.11**\]. The estimated annual cost per user for single\-use intermittent catheters is GBP2,190 \(based on typical usage of 4 catheters per day at a mean intermittent catheter cost of GBP1.50\). If one Emteva is substituted for all daily catheterisations, this equates to an annual saving for all female intermittent catheter users in the UK of more than GBP32,000,000 and a 100% reduction in plastic catheters being thrown away. 

 Based on the findings in **3.7**, Wilks was awarded a Small Business Research Initiative grant \(GBP530,000; NIHR\) to develop and test a biodegradable, biocidal, impregnated wipe to offer a quick, discreet alternative or complementary cleaning method to Milton. This was designed to further increase the uptake of reusable intermittent catheters. A partnership with JVS Products Ltd developed a biocidal wipe that was shown to be effective at cleaning reusable catheters ‘on the go’. Having achieved its Class I CE mark in 2020, JVS temporarily pivoted the product towards the surface cleaning market in response to the Covid\-19 pandemic, achieving more than 150,000 in sales up to December 31, 2020 \[ **5.13**\]. 

 **Improved options for safe penile compression device use and development of the ‘Southampton clamp’** 

 Having identified through their research \[ **3.3**\] a need among men for an effective, reusable clamp to enable physical activity and reduce reliance on disposable, plastic\-backed pads, the UoS group, together with clamp users, co\-designed a new clamp that is more effective, more comfortable/less painful and easier to use than existing designs. The ‘Southampton clamp’ \[ **5.14**\] provides a reusable \(and therefore sustainable\), discreet and secure way of preventing leakage after prostatectomy. A preliminary user trial showed that men felt the design is discrete and looks good, and is easy to put on and take off, compared with the best of the currently available clamps. A new industry partner will support prototype development, licensing \(CE marking\) and commercialisation of the clamp \(and other newly developed products\) via internet sales and the Drug Tariff \[ **5.15**\]. Currently manufacturers’ guidance provided with several clamp brands is not based on evidence, which places users at risk of pressure\-related skin damage. Working with clamp users, UoS research also enabled the development and publication of evidence\-based generic clamp guidance on the *Continence Product Advisor*.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Computational Mechanics and Reliability Group \(CMRG\) at University of Greenwich develops state\-of\-the\-art numerical models to estimate when and how innovative, high\-reliability, and high\-value electronics systems will fail. The work's impacts relate to economic impacts \(£30,000,000\) for electronics companies in the aerospace sector, such as Leonardo and Micross, through better\-printed circuit board assembly designs that meet these high value\-added electronic systems' reliability requirements. Our work has also led Microsemi to adopt 3D printing in their electronics manufacturing processes, reducing costs and time to market by 10%, and reducing material wastage by 2\-3%. Additionally, we have extended our knowledge through the IEEE \(the world’s largest technology professional society\), impacting the development of new standards and influencing a technology roadmap for practitioners in the worldwide electronics sector.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research activity at the University of Greenwich in Electronics Packaging, led by **Professor Chris Bailey**, began in 1998. Electronics packaging involves selecting components \(semiconductors, bare printed circuit boards, etc.\), materials, and assembly processes to manufacture assembled printed circuit boards and then to test these boards and then assemble these boards into electronics systems that range from mobile phones to avionics radar systems. A key challenge for the electronics industry is to ensure that the design of these assembled printed circuit boards meet end\-user requirements in terms of their reliability for different market applications. 

 Since 2000, CMRG has focused its research activities on developing modelling and simulation techniques to support Design for Reliability \(DfR\) by predicting the mechanical behaviour in these electronic assemblies when subjected to changes in temperature during pre\-board assembly, board assembly, reliability testing, and when in\-service as an electronic system \(in a mobile phone, aircraft, etc.\). The research methodologies are based on finite element methods using high\-performance computing \(HPC\) to predict the physics taking place across the four stages of product development as detailed in the figure below. The developed modelling techniques provide the ability to support DfR and predict the magnitudes of changes in temperature, stress, damage \(cracks, etc\) in all the materials, making up an assembled printed circuit board from the pre\-board assembly to the final electronic system. 



 Our early research \(2000\-2004\) was supported by three EPSRC projects in collaboration with BAE Systems, Rolls Royce, Celestica Ltd, Multicore solders, MBDA, Alpha Metals, and DEK. This research undertaken by CMRG developed the first multi\-physics models to predict the changes in temperature, stress, and damage during the reflow process and subsequent reliability testing of Flip\-Chip electronic components \[ **3.1**\]. From 2004\-2019, CMRG has extended its modelling expertise to other electronic components, including Ball Grid Arrays \(BGA\) and Quad Flat No\-Leads \(QFN\); refinishing processes \(e.g. hot\-solder dip, and laser deballing/re\-balling\); novel board assembly processes such as 3D Printing; reliability test environments \(aerospace\); and health monitoring \(prognostics\) of electronic systems. 

 In 2004, CMRG started its long\-term collaboration with Leonardo \(ex BAe Systems Avionics\). Using component, materials, and thermal profiles \(test and in\-service\) data from Leonardo, CMRG extended its flip\-chip models to predict the thermo\-mechanical behaviour of BGA components. These newly developed models predict the thermally induced fatigue \(and associated cracks\) in the solder joints when the assembled BGA component is subjected to these thermal profiles. The models confirmed that the location of failure predicted in a reliability test would be the same as that seen when the electronic assembly is used in an aircraft environment. As with the flip\-chip components, our models also identified printed circuit board \(PCB\) and underfill material properties to ensure the assembled PCB meets the aerospace reliability requirements for 25 years of life within an aircraft environment \[ **3.2**\]. 

 From 2004\-2019, funded by EPSRC, DTI, EU, US Govt, and consultancy projects with Industry, CMRG extended its modelling capabilities to predict the reliability of many other electronic component constructions and assembled PCB’s. For the aerospace sector, the research challenge is to use low\-cost commercial electronic components. From 2011\-2019, CMRG collaborated with industry partners including Leonardo, Rolls Royce, Micross Semiconductors, Cassidian \(Germany\), and General Dynamics \(USA\). Using manufacturing process data provided by Micross Semiconductors and Leonardo's component data, our first project developed the first thermo\-mechanical finite element model of the pre\-board assembly hot\-solder dip refinishing process. The developed models' results demonstrated that the electronic components' exposure to the temperatures induced by the refinishing process would not result in damage to the component \[ **3.3**\]. 

 From 2014\-19, we extended our modelling capability to complex electronic component constructions such as QFN’s and Micro\-BGA’s. Using materials data and component construction data from Leonardo, these models predicted the physics that govern the fatigue damage of the assembled PCB’s that these components are mounted to during reliability testing. Key findings include the thermo\-mechanical effect that materials such as conformal coatings have on these PCB assemblies' reliability and identified specific material properties that would ensure that the aerospace reliability specifications are met \[ **3.4**\]. 

 The benefits of 3D printing for the electronics industry is its ability to design, manufacture, and assemble complex and unique printed circuit board designs with complex shapes and non\-planar geometry at low cost and much less material wastage compared to traditional reflow assembly. Funded by the EU \(from 2013\-2017\), and in collaboration with industry partners such as Microsemi, who provided materials and component data, we extended our board assembly modelling techniques to predict the thermo\-mechanical behaviour of conductive and non\-conductive materials printed using a 3D printing process. Key findings included the developed models' ability to predict the residual stresses during the printing process and identify suitable material properties and printing process parameters that ensured the fabricated printed circuit boards meet the reliability requirements for the relevant electronic system \[ **3.5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 CMRG has been developing DfR modelling techniques since early 2000’s. Our research has been widely disseminated, with over 400 academic publications on the topic. However, our primary means to transition the knowledge developed through to direct industrial impact is through our partnerships with many international major electronics companies. Industrial partners adopting our DfR technologies can develop electronics systems with improved reliability and reduced in\-service failures. Product failures have costs, both fiscal and reputational. For example, the costs of each reliability test \(which can run over a period of 6 months\) is in\-excess of £100,000 and the cost of a product failure in the field can run into £M’s. 

 **Implementation of UoG research at Leonardo has led to financial impacts.** Leonardo Spa, based in Edinburgh, employs 2,000 people and specialises in the provision of multi surveillance radars and countermeasures systems. It produces world\-leading technology, including Captor Radar for the Typhoon aircraft. The ability to develop and manufacture this equipment on\-shore is of strategic importance to the UK, allowing the Ministry of Defence \(MOD\) to operate without other nation\-states' intervention and maintain an operational advantage over potential adversaries. 

 The transfer of knowledge between the CMRG and Leonardo occurred through direct consultancy in 2004\-2005 and 2018\-2019, and through collaboration on US Government funded projects throughout 2011\-2018. As per the contracts, CMRG provided quarterly reports to the funder and Leonardo, and meetings took place at the company premises to discuss the results from the models. CMRG model predictions for different components \[ **3.2 & 3.4**\] were successfully implemented into radar signal processors, where each processor has a value of the order of £600,000 and the Radar itself has a value of the order of £3,000,000. From 2014 – 31<sup>st</sup> July, 2020, the results from the models developed by CMRG has informed Leonardo’s design protocols and manufacturing standards, and this has removed greater than £30,000,000 of design and qualification risks by ensuring the right materials and assembly processes are used, hence significantly reducing the number of reliability tests **.** The distinct and material contributions made by CMRG to the impacts listed above are confirmed by the University & Emerging Technologies Manager at Leonardo, who states “ *the results and knowledge generated from your research has been extremely successful in informing Leonardo’s design protocols and manufacturing standards, providing significant benefits to us, our suppliers, and customers globally including our major contracts with Governments in the UK, Italy, Spain, and Germany,*” \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **Research by UoG academics helped Micross and Leonardo gain greater insight into refinishing process and secure significant annual growth in this service**. Micross Semiconductors is a US company whose refinishing process is used by the high\-reliability electronics sector \(including Leonardo\). From 2011\-2014, CMRG worked closely with Micross and Leonardo on a US Government funded project to develop models of the hot\-solder dip refinishing process \[ **3.3**\]. Knowledge transfer between CMRG and these companies took place through quarterly reports and meetings at the Crew, UK, Micross facility. The results from the models of 23 electronic component types supported Micross and its customer Leonardo in gaining a greater insight into the thermo\-mechanical behaviour of the components when subjected to this refinishing process, providing more guidance than found in the current GEIA\-STD\-005\-2 standard. The results helped Micross secure significant growth in this service throughout the period 2014 \- July 31<sup>st</sup>, 2020. For example, the University & Emerging Technologies Manager at Leonardo states “ *computational models developed by your team for the Hot Solder Dipping process – a service provided by Micross Semiconductors – helped Leonardo successfully assess the behaviour of our electronic components when subjected to this refinishing process”* \[ **5.1**\] and the Product Line Manager at Micross states “ *the modelling work undertaken at Greenwich* *has helped us gain a clear insight into to the refinishing process supporting us to deliver product of the highest standard to our worldwide customer base,“* \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **UoG research fed into Microsemi’s assessment of 3D\-Printing for electronics packaging resulting in reductions in material wastage and cost saving benefits.** Microsemi \(now Microchip\) is a US company with facilities worldwide, including its Advanced Electronic Packaging facility in Caldicot, Wales, UK, which offers a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor and electronic systems solutions for communications, defence and security, aerospace, and industrial markets. During the period 2013\-2017, CMRG collaborated with MicroSemi on the EU\-Funded project NextFactory. The models developed by CMRG for the 3D\-Printing process during this project provided significant insights into the feasibility of MicroSemi adopting this process and addressing the key technical barrier of residual stresses in the fabricated parts. Based on the results from the NextFactory project \(including the modelling undertaken by CMRG \[ **3.5**\]\), in 2019, Microsemi purchased a 3D printer to support its strategy in driving the next generation of 3D electronics systems miniaturization. During the period to 31<sup>st</sup> July, 2020, this led to a 2\-3% reduction in material wastage compared to traditional reflow\-based board assembly processes and a decrease in time to market and cost savings of 10%. The ability to design genuinely 3D print printed electronic products has also opened\-up new product lines for the company \[ **5.3**\]. Technical staff engineer at Microchip states, “ *the results from your models have supported our assessment of this manufacturing process and in Summer 2019 the company purchased a 3D printer to supplement our existing stencil printers. This printer is now used with our design and manufacturing departments for prototype evaluation and tooling for several high\-value export products to North America and Europe”.* 

 **UoG’s work into modelling and simulation made significant contributions to IEEE Standards and Roadmapping.** The IEEE is the world’s largest professional body with over 420,000 members globally. Most of the world’s major electronics companies are members of IEEE. As part of its relationship with IEEE and the high\-quality work in modelling and simulation produced over the years, CMRG was invited to participate in the development of the Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap \(HIR\) in 2016 \[ **5.4**\]. The HIR roadmap provides state\-of\-the\-art / best practice in Electronics Packaging and its drive to produce the next generation of 3D heterogeneous electronic systems. It contains the chapter Modelling & Simulation, which is led by CMRG. This involved **Professor Bailey** chairing the Technical Working Group for this chapter bringing together experts in modelling and simulation worldwide to contribute to the chapter’s contents, which contains material from CMRG – particularly our research into multi\-physics modelling and design for reliability. From 2019\-July 31<sup>st</sup>, 2020, the HIR roadmap has been downloaded 24,197 times by engineers at electronics companies and research organisations globally. This is confirmed by the IEEE \[ **5.5**\] and the roadmap’s manager and the Chief Scientific Advisor of ASE group, the world’s largest semiconductor assembly & test company states: “ *The modelling & simulation research undertaken by the Greenwich team provided significant contributions to the Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap. This roadmap is now guiding the worldwide electronics industry to progress beyond 56\-years of ‘Moore’s Law’ \(transistor and economics scaling\) through innovations in advanced electronics packaging and heterogeneous integration”.* \[ **5.4**\]. 

 From 2012\-2017, **Professor Bailey** also contributed to the IEEE Standard P1856 \(Standard Framework for Prognostics and Health Management of Electronic Systems\) as part of its development working group. This standard provides the electronics industry with best practice guidance on the use of techniques \(including modelling and simulation\) for prognostics in electronic systems. The standard and the roadmap are both conduits to transition the group’s DfR expertise into improvements in the reliability of products of a great many companies globally. The manager of the standard confirms: “ *The research undertaken by the Greenwich team contributed to this important standard for the electronics industry to address the latest techniques in Prognostics and Health Management for electronics systems across the electronics ecosystem from consumer electronics to renewable energy to medical devices to aerospace”* \[ **5.6**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Manufacturing processes introduce internal \(residual\) stresses causing unwanted distortion and shortening the life of structures. The Open University has developed novel variants of the Contour Method of residual stress determination and applied it to map stresses in over 150 components for industrial clients. The measurements have changed manufacturing processes, validated numerical modelling, improved fracture control and contributed to industrial assessment procedures across aerospace, nuclear, medical and additive manufacture sectors. Our research has catalysed a UK start\-up, a Centre of Excellence for Advanced Materials in China, and commitment to a National Stress Engineering Centre at Harwell.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Most manufacturing processes introduce hidden internal stresses in products and structures. These “residual stresses” cause distortion and can shorten the useful life of structures. Conversely beneficial residual stresses can be introduced to control manufacturing processes and improve product performance. The research challenge is how to quantify and control residual stresses in highly complex manufactured parts. 

 The Contour Method of residual stress determination involves cutting a body containing stress at a cross\-section of interest. The surfaces created by the cut deform as the residual stresses relax during the cut. The “contour” of the newly created distorted surfaces is then measured and an elastic finite element stress analysis used to back\-calculate the cross\-sectional distribution of undisturbed residual stresses acting normal to the plane of the cut. 

 The Contour Method has been implemented and extended by OU researchers following its publication in 2000. **Edwards, Fitzpatrick and Gungor**, for instance, applied the technique in conjunction with other approaches to welded plate joints made from aerospace aluminium alloys and in 2008, our research team **\[O1\]** implemented a novel multi\-axial contour method to measure the full residual stress tensor in a plasma arc weld. 

 **Bouchard and Hosseinzadeh** pioneered application of the Contour Method to complex geometry engineering structures via a 4 year “ *Advanced Contour Measurement Technology Research Programme*” \(2009\-13\) funded by the East Midlands Development Agency, Rolls\-Royce and the OU. They published original work **\[O2\]** that quantifies factors contributing to cutting artefacts and identifies approaches to mitigate them. An early breakthrough involved applying the Contour Method to map hoop residual stresses in a welded pipe based upon the novel idea of using a diametral cut parallel to the pipe axis **\[O3\]**. This paper also describes the first application of a hybrid measurement technique \(Contour Method coupled with X\-ray diffraction\) for a welded pipe, mapping three direct components of the residual stress tensor. These innovations have allowed residual stresses to be measured in multiple directions in cylindrical structures of complex geometry \(for example valves and turbine discs\). 

 The practical significance of OU research underpinning the Contour Method was set out by Hosseinzadeh, Kowal, and **Bouchard** in 2014 **\[O4\]**. This publication described the state of understanding of the technique through addressing three fundamental questions: how to cut components, how to measure surface deformation and how to analyse the measured data. The significance of introducing plasticity error during cutting is addressed by Hosseinzadeh **\[O5\]** and effective strategies for presented for mitigating such errors. In 2017, OU research staff developed a new method for dealing with asymmetric stiffness of cut parts that has been applied to complex geometry industrial parts and incorporated in our recent publication describing a new Incremental Contour Method, iCM **\[O6\]**. 

 OU research staff have supervised 9 PhD researchers who have contributed to Contour Method technology since 2000. These include research on the Rosette Method, near surface stresses, managing plasticity, applications to T\-butt welds, piping welds, measuring shear stress using the fracture surface approach, length\-scale refinement, asymmetric cuts and the bulge correction.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 OU Contour Method research has impacted manufacturing, the lifetime performance of components, safety, professional practice, commerce and the economy. Pathways to impact comprise collaboration with businesses, global sharing of knowledge and expertise through published work and conferences, providing advanced measurement services to industry, catalysing other providers of Contour Method measurements, hosting training seminars and contributing to the development of improved Structural Integrity Assessment Procedures. 

 **Enhanced safe lifetime performance** 

 In nuclear power **EDF Energy \[C1\]** state that “ *Open University’s research in developing the Contour Method of residual stress determination and applying it to map residual stresses in complex welded structures has helped ensure safe and reliable operation of EDF Energy power stations. These outputs have also provided EDF Energy with valuable benchmark data that have been incorporated in R6, which is one of the key procedures that EDF Energy uses to assess the integrity of their UK nuclear assets*”. For example, the OU applied Contour Method in tandem with the slitting technique and revealed high levels of residual stress in Compact Tension tests specimens that explained unexpectedly high crack growth rates observed in the creep crack growth tests. EDF Energy **\[C1\]** further state that “ *this work is now a key reference underpinning EDF Energy advice on creep crack growth rates in Type 316H HAZ materials*” and that “ *this advice has been used in safety case assessments for key high\- temperature components in the UK’s Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors, reducing unexpected down time and enhancing the safety and cost\-effectiveness of nuclear power plant*”. 

 **Improved codes and standards for the nuclear energy sector** 

 The R6 Procedure for the Assessment of Structures Containing Defects **\[C2,** pp.6\-7 **\]**, developed by the UK nuclear industry and used worldwide, sets out a fracture mechanics\-based methodology for assessing the safety of critical plant \(i.e. to guard against catastrophic failure\). Three new sections dealing with residual stress have been added to the R6 procedure over the past decade: Section III.15 \(Calculation of Residual Stress in Weldments\); Section V.5 \(Validation Sheets for the Calculation of Residual Stress in Weldments\); and Section V.6 \(Worked Example of the Calculation of Residual Stress\). The OU has contributed to these new sections through membership of R6 Panel subgroups \(Weld Modelling Guidelines and Benchmarks, Weld Residual Stress Profiles\) and by providing maps of residual stress reference data for benchmark test components that have been measured by the Contour Method, see **\[C1\]**. 

 **Improved manufacture** 

 OU research has advanced the capabilities of the Contour Method of residual stress determination, raised its Technology Readiness Level \(TRL\) and applied it to map stresses in more than 150 components since August 2013 via industry measurement contracts worth over GBP1,500,000. Many of these measured residual stress maps have changed manufacturing processes, validated numerical modelling, optimised fatigue lifetime and improved fracture control across manufacturing, aerospace, nuclear, offshore and medical sectors. Some examples are set out below. 

 **Rolls\-Royce** **\[C3\]** has contracted the OU to carry out more than 20 Contour Method work packages with a total cost of \~ GBP500,000 from August 2013\-20 **\[C3\]**. Typical examples include mapping stresses in Trent 1000 turbine discs to confirm the accuracy of manufacturing process models; in rotary friction joints for optimising welding processes, in double helical gears to quantify the impact of different manufacturing processes, in test components manufactured by Selective Laser Melting in order to validate process models, and in additively manufactured parts. Rolls\-Royce **\[C3\]** specifically state that the measurements performed by OU *“have reduced costs, improved manufacturing processes, validating process models and supported safety cases for nuclear power plants. The benefit to Rolls\-Royce is significant as evidenced by the volume of measurements, their diversity of application, and the relevance to the different business units within Rolls\-Royce.*” 

 **Airbus Defence and Space \[C4\]** is responsible for the design of propellant tanks used for both telecommunication and scientific based space missions. These high energy, hazardous propellant tanks are safety critical during the propellant loading phase and are subject to fracture control requirements. Airbus commissioned the OU to measure the residual stress levels introduced by the planetary end\-cap electron beam weld of their latest spherical tank design, for the next generation Eurostar spacecraft platform \(ENEO\). The Contour method results confirmed and validated analytical predictions of weld induced residual stress that have been subsequently used to demonstrate the fracture tolerance of the latest tank design to potential manufacturing defects. Airbus **\[C4\]** state that “ *this contribution to the necessary fracture control programme has been reviewed and accepted by customers and the European Space Agency”* and finally note that “ *the qualification tank has now successfully passed its pressure cycling requirements and \[…\] its burst pressure requirement.*” 

 **DePuy** is part of the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies and offers a comprehensive portfolio of orthopaedic products **.** The Staff Material Engineer **\[C5\]** confirmed “ *the impact of the Open University’s research and implementation of the contour method residual stress measurements on our femoral knee implant components and on improving the efficiency of our manufacturing processes*”. Femoral knee implants are one component of a total\-knee\-replacement where residual stresses play a key role. Dimensional distortion of femoral knee implants during manufacture \(leading to rejection\) is a direct consequence of residual stresses being induced or pre\-existing residual stresses re\-distributing. A series of contour method measurements were conducted on femoral knee implants by the OU which showed that the shot\- blasting manufacturing process significantly alters the bulk residual stress of the femoral from its as\-cast condition. These ‘ *resulted in optimized manufacturing routes, increased quality assurance when it comes to checking changes at the blasting step due to possible impact/dimensional changes at machining and improved product quality*” **\[C5\]**. 

 **CETIM \[C6\]** is a Technical Centre for Mechanical Industry based in France with a EUR150M overall business volume. Over the past 7 years, Cetim has commissioned Contour Method measurement work from the OU for 13 projects at a total cost of GBP120,000. For example, contour method measurements \(using the OU multiple\-cut, multiple\-method variants\) were conducted on a 2m diameter gear for the offshore industry \(wind turbines\) in order to validate the use of a carburizing method for increased strength and wear resistance through introducing beneficial compressive residual stresses near the tooth of the wheel. 

 **Impact on other organisations and companies supporting industry** 

 OU Contour Mapping research underpins the development of further centres designed to apply the findings to support industrial and manufacturing improvements. In 2017 OU researchers set up Stress\-Space Ltd \( [www.stress\-space.com](http://www.stress-space.com/)\). The company is growing with GBP232,000 revenue in 2019/20, and delivers residual services to business largely based on published OU research \(as set out in Section 2\). For example, its Contour method stress measurements on transmission drive chain parts for an aerospace prime *“revealed the limitations of the initial design \(fatigue hot spot\) and was used to assess the merits of an improved design with a new manufacturing route in order to eliminate the risk of failure during service operation*” **\[C7\]**. The merits of Stress\-Space Ltd’s Business Case for Growth \(founded on application of OU Contour method research\), resulted in its selection to participate in the prestigious ESA BIC UK Incubation Programme in 2019 attracting research funds exceeding GBP150,000 **\[C7\]**. 

 The Centre of Excellence for Advanced Materials \( [www.Ceamat.com](http://www.ceamat.com/)\) in Dongguan, China has adopted the OU’s Contour method technology to create a new GBP10,000,000 Stress Measurement Facility. Director of the Stress Measurement Facility **\[C8\]**, who was an OU researcher from 2013 – 2018 noted: “ *Our organisation and the stress analysis department in particular has greatly benefited from the various educational lectures you provided, the contour method seminar you organised and advice you provided on equipment purchase and setting our research priorities \[…\] it is our ambition to bring this technology to the Chinese market and achieve similar and wider benefits.”* 

 OU Contour Method research has catalysed **\[C9\]** an ambitious collaborative plan to establish a National Stress Engineering Centre \(N\-SEC\) at Harwell which will “ *co\-locate several complementary measurement techniques, including the Contour method, with the neutron capabilities at ISIS* \[STFC Facility\] *Together with a new neutron instrument, e\-MAP, the combined capabilities would really be unique in the world”*.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Evidence from LSHTM research has influenced many high\-profile decisions about new vaccines, and how and when people in England are immunised against a range of diseases. Health and economic modelling specialists regularly presented analysis of the impact of potential changes to the UK vaccination schedule to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation \(JCVI\). This directly informed recommendations to introduce new vaccines or change the way existing vaccines were used to improve coverage and efficiency throughout 2013 to 2020. LSHTM research underpinned key changes, such as introducing meningitis B vaccination, influenza vaccination in children, and HPV schedule changes, saving lives, reducing morbidity, and saving millions of pounds of NHS resources. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Vaccines prevent disease and save lives. But vaccinations introduced to a population also have wider benefits, including preventing healthcare costs and loss of productivity for those vaccinated who would otherwise have suffered from a disease. 

 Research teams at LSHTM led by Jit and Edmunds used mathematical modelling to predict the impact of different potential UK vaccine strategies. The results were then used in economic models that projected the implications of different strategies for NHS resources and UK population health, to determine if a strategy was cost\-effective. These models translated the special characteristics of infectious diseases into outcomes satisfying the gold standard methods set by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) for evaluating all health interventions. 

 The models drew on data and expert knowledge from electronic health database experts at LSHTM as well as from long\-standing collaboration with scientists at Public Health England \(PHE\). LSHTM’s methodological excellence and the strength of its collaborative ties with PHE were recognised in 2014 when LSHTM was awarded an NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Immunisation, to continue this work on evidence for vaccine decisions. The teams at LSHTM applied mathematical models of transmission to virological, clinical, epidemiological and behavioural data to make predictions on the health and economic implications of vaccines against influenza \(seasonal and pandemic\), human papillomavirus \(HPV\), meningococcus, pneumococcus, and many other diseases that can be prevented by a vaccine. 

 **Influenza vaccination** 

 In 2013, the team estimated the reduction in infections and deaths achieved by England and Wales’ flu vaccination programme, compared with no vaccination, and found that children were key spreaders \(3.1\). Targeting the people who transmitted flu by extending the vaccination programme to 5\- to 16\-year\-old children was found to increase the efficiency of the whole programme, resulting in an overall reduction of 0.7 infections per dose and 1.95 deaths per 1,000 doses. Extending the programme was also found to be highly cost\-effective \(3.2\). 

 **Meningococcus B vaccination** 

 Similarly, in 2014, the researchers found that routine infant immunisation for group B meningococcal disease was the most effective vaccination strategy, preventing 27% of meningococcal disease cases over the lifetime of an English birth cohort by vaccinating infants at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age. They also estimated that 71% of meningococcal B cases could be prevented after 10 years by routine vaccination of infants in combination with a large\-scale catch\-up campaign \(3.3\). Routine infant immunisation was also found to be cost\-effective at GBP3 a vaccine dose, and could result in long\-term reductions in cases \(3.4\). 

 **HPV vaccination** 

 The HPV vaccine protects against cancers caused by HPV, including cervical cancer, and some mouth, throat, anal and genital cancers, and against genital warts. In the UK, HPV vaccination was offered to girls aged 12 to 13 through a 3\-dose schedule. Following clinical trials suggesting that 2 doses may offer sufficient protection against HPV, Jit and colleagues investigated whether offering the vaccination as a 2\-dose schedule would be a cost\-effective approach. 

 They compared 2\-dose and 3\-dose HPV vaccine schedules in the UK among males and females aged 12 to 74 years. This cost\-effectiveness study was based on a dynamic model of HPV vaccination. The 2\-dose schedule was found to be the most cost\-effective option if 2 doses provided more than 20 years’ protection against HPV\-related cancers \(3.5\). 

 **Conjugate pneumococcal vaccination** 

 The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine \(PCV\) protects against serious pneumonia caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and is given on the NHS to those at a higher risk of illness, including babies, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions. Van Hoek assessed the cost\-effectiveness of this programme in older adults aged 65 years and over, in a static cohort cost\-effectiveness model of adults with normal immune responses, who were due to be vaccinated in the autumn of 2016 with a PCV \(3.6\). The analysis demonstrated that whilst the programme was effective in preventing pneumococcus diseases, the wider benefits of the vaccination programme in children significantly reducing incidence of the disease in adults meant that the programme targeting the elderly was not cost\-effective given the cost of vaccine administration.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation \(JCVI\) advises UK health departments about vaccines that should be introduced. Under the Health Protection \(Vaccination\) Regulations 2009, the Health Secretary is obliged to adopt these recommendations if certain conditions are met, the most important of which is that they are based on an assessment that demonstrates cost\-effectiveness. LSHTM has been the main provider of the first opinion for the health and economic modelling evidence required to assess this, in collaboration with PHE. LSHTM researchers regularly attended JCVI meetings to present evidence before publication, and advised JCVI members prior to their final recommendation. Economic evaluations from LSHTM were also used in the tendering process by the Department of Health and Social Care when selecting manufacturers to supply vaccines to the UK. 

 As a result of JCVI recommendations underpinned by LSHTM research, changes to vaccine schedules have directly benefited thousands of vaccine recipients since 2013. They have also provided indirect protection to the UK public by reducing the spread of infection and averting cases in other individuals, reduced the burden of several diseases, and saved on NHS resources. There are also the wider benefits of averting costs to society and the individual, and of the quality of life improved by disease prevention. 

 **Evidence of impact on specific vaccines:** 

 **Influenza** 

 In 2012, Edmunds and Baguelin presented work to the JCVI on the cost\-effectiveness of changes to flu vaccination; the JCVI recommended extending the flu campaign to include school\-aged children \(age 5 to 17\) and children aged 2 to 5 \(5.1\). This supported the gradual roll\-out of seasonal influenza vaccination to children, beginning with a pilot in 2013 where all 2\- to 3\-year\-olds were offered vaccination through GPs in England, and a pilot in English schools. This pilot was extended every year to include all children up to school year 6 \(age 10 to 11\) in 2019 and 2020 \(5.2\). It eventually became the largest change ever made to the UK’s vaccination programmes in terms of numbers of people vaccinated. Projections suggested that around 5 million extra people would be vaccinated every year, and around 2.5 million fewer would get influenza, when the programme covered all primary school children, compared to before the programme was implemented. The flu vaccine is now offered to all children aged 2 to 10 years old, meaning all primary school age children are now eligible for vaccination and direct protection from flu, and those aged up to 18 years old in clinical risk groups. Data from the 2019/2020 winter season provided by all local authorities showed that over 2.8 million children from reception to school year 6 were vaccinated, representing 60.4% of the eligible pool of primary school age children \(5.3\). 

 With the risk of COVID\-19 and flu both circulating at the same time over the winter of 2020, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) \(of which Edmunds was a member\) advised the UK government that seasonal flu vaccination should be more widely deployed to protect vulnerable individuals \(5.4\). In autumn 2020, flu vaccination was additionally offered to household contacts of those on the NHS Shielded Patient List, children in year 7 \(age 11 to 12\) in secondary schools, and health and social care workers employed through Direct Payment and/or Personal Health Budgets \(5.4\). 

 **HPV** 

 Since 2013, Jit has presented several pieces of work to the JCVI which underpinned successive changes to the HPV vaccination programme, offering direct protection to the public and reducing the burden of HPV\-related cancers. These included: 

1.  Changing the schedule from 3 to 2 doses in 2014 \(5.5\), saving up to 800,000 doses annually \(reflecting the size of the 12\-13 age cohort\) of a quadrivalent vaccine that costs the NHS up to GBP86.50 per dose to procure and distribute \(3.1, 3.2\), with the added benefit of reduced logistical complexity. This work also informed international stakeholders, for example, the World Health Organization’s recommendation of a 2\-dose HPV vaccination in 2014 \(5.6\). 

1.  Rolling out, in 2017, the world’s first programme to vaccinate men who have sex with men \(MSM\), who are at exceptionally high risk of acquiring HPV\-related cancers \(5.7\). 

1.  Vaccinating all boys in England aged 12 to 13 from 2019 onwards \(5.8\). 

 **Meningococcal B** 

 In 2013 and 2014, Edmunds presented impact and cost\-effectiveness analyses to the JCVI which led to babies being given the infant meningococcal B vaccination, making the UK the first country in the world to do so \(5.9\). This was a complex decision, involving a vaccine with an innovative but relatively untried mechanism of action, a rare but devastating disease, and interest from a large number of civil society groups \(such as meningitis charities\). The vaccine was introduced in 2015 to children at 2, 4 and 12 months, preventing hundreds of meningitis cases per year. Public Health England data in 2020 showed that since the vaccine’s introduction, cases of meningitis B disease in England fell by 62% in children who received at least two doses \(5.10\). 

 **Conjugate pneumococcal** 

 In 2015, van Hoek presented work to the JCVI showing that vaccinating older adults with a conjugate pneumococcal vaccine would have little impact and not be cost\-effective \(5.11\). Based on this research, the JCVI did not introduce this vaccination. An independent report by RAND Europe stated that this decision saved the NHS up to GBP25 million pounds per year, and the NIHR recognised this work as 1 of 100 examples of positive change arising from its support of research in its first 10 years \(5.12\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Post\-apartheid South Africa experiences a profound disharmony between law and custom in urban home inheritance, creating unclear lines of ownership. Bolt’s research has impacted policy debate and services through collaboration with ProBono.Org, a legal NGO, which seeks to provide free legal representation for all who need it in South Africa, as well as advocating for legislative and policy reform. Core impact lies in: 

-  **Influencing ProBono’s professional practice**, informing their approach to legal remedies and access to justice, facilitating funding and building advocacy capacity; 

-  **Stimulating policy debate and establishing a sustained campaign for change** among government, legal and civil\-society stakeholders, and contributing to draft legislation consultation; 

-  **Creating a priority legislative reform programme** to advise senior Human Settlements officials. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Bolt’s research offers critical insight on an enduring problem in post\-apartheid South Africa. “Family houses” lie at the heart of a gulf between social norms and law, marginalising urban black people despite the formal end of segregation. Under apartheid, black people were prohibited from owning urban property. As apartheid unravelled, township rental houses became private property to promote market inclusion through new asset owners. But popular understandings of property and inheritance diverged from official ones, deepened by distrust in an unclear administrative process. Family houses are regarded as cross\-generational, collective patrimony, diverging from the law’s insistence on exclusive and usually individual ownership. Furthermore, the current systems for land registration and succession do not sufficiently recognise popular norms. Bolt’s interdisciplinary social, institutional and legal perspective has illuminated the previously unrecognised complexity of the gap between law and popular norms. 

 The findings below emerged from a project on inheritance in Johannesburg \(ESRC Future Research Leaders, 2016–2019\). Collaboration for impact was built into a year’s ethnographic fieldwork — including shadowing officials, observations of legal advice, disputes and court cases, and township case studies — which offered unparalleled insight into how inheritance interacts with state systems. The research has been disseminated in position papers for key stakeholders \(RO2, RO3\), then in a widely circulated academic article \(RO1\), with a public lecture reconceptualising state administration \(RO4\). 

 **Key research findings \(RF\) emerging from the project are as follows:** 

 **RF1:** Collective entitlement is popularly understood to be “proven” by apartheid\-era “family permits”, which regulated tenancy and are no longer officially recognised. More complex than “culture” at odds with the state, popular norms emerge from layers of bureaucratic intervention and informal uses of formal documentation \(RO4\). 

 **RF2:** Even so, the family house is widely understood as a matter of urban custom. This has crucial implications, because customary law is constitutionally protected and the Constitutional Court emphasises the “living customary law” of everyday norms \(RO1, RO2, RO3\). 

 **RF3:** Disputes over ownership today demonstrate two areas of confusion. First, when freehold title to houses was implemented, individual family members sometimes gained ownership without the knowledge of other potential claimants. Second, as “custodian” \(guardian of collective family property\), a “family representative” was sent to claim the rental house on everyone’s behalf, but the state granted that person exclusive ownership \(RO1, RO2\). 

 **RF4:** Inheritance adds an important dimension: urban black communities see succession law as unjust — the imposed norms of the white elite — prioritising nuclear family over kin group, and asset over patrimony. But custom has its own complexities, often used to justify male control, ostracising widows and children. Discontinuity between law and custom causes many township dwellers to avoid formal processes. The deceased is routinely left as “owner”, re\-asserting ancestors’ centrality in anchoring collective family patrimony. Such avoidance pushes already\-marginalised people beyond legal protection \(RO1, RO2\). 

 **RF5:** When disputes spill beyond private mediation, official process promises resolution. But, as family members find their stories reinterpreted as administrative “cases”, unfamiliarity and disagreement with the law intensify lack of trust in an overstretched, uneven system \(RO1, RO2, RO4\). 

 **RF6:** It is thus important to bring customary norms within legal protection, addressing social exclusion while ensuring they are non\-discriminatory and compliant with South Africa’s constitution \(RO3\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Bolt’s research has **substantially influenced the practices of legal NGO ProBono.Org regarding the “family house”**. It has created new advocacy for legal\-administrative reform, by informing their policies and delivery of services. ProBono.Org positions itself as the first and only organisation of its kind in South Africa. It promotes access to justice and provides free legal assistance to ‘thousands of poor clients’ \(S1\) with branches across South Africa’s three largest metropoles: Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town. Sustained collaboration with ProBono.Org within Gauteng Province \(incorporating Johannesburg and Pretoria\) resulted in a campaign for evidence\-based planning to make law and administration more responsive to popular norms  \(RF4\). The campaign has **stimulated and informed policy debate** and **established Family House legislation reform as a key priority** \(S5\). Gauteng Province is the country’s leading metropolitan area, and has long been a test case for housing issues and includes a very large number of family houses \(there are over 100,000 in Soweto’s townships alone\).

It established a new priority area in the NGO \(‘The Family House Project’\) and equipped them with a new interpretation of existing socio\-legal dynamics shaping how they view their own role. In the words of both the former National Director and Head of Housing: 

-  ‘Dr Bolt’s research resulted in services that took into account the social context of inheritance and \[… revealed\] that a disconnect exists between the law as it currently stands and popular understanding’ \(S1; RF3, RF4\). 

-  ‘This research has \[…\] enabled us as an organisation that was mostly focused on clinical work \(legal advice and legal services\) and empowerment to have a broader perspective \[…\] we are now exploring what legal reform means in the sense of ensuring the access we want to create \[…\] is socially impactful’ \(S2\). 

-  ‘Dr Bolt’s research and collaboration \[…\] enabled us to raise funding for access to justice in the administration of deceased estates \[…\] to ensure that we can build on Bolt’s research insights and advocate for change in the administrative process’ \(S1\). 

 Bolt has worked closely and regularly with Heads of Housing at ProBono.Org since 2016 **developing a plan for advocacy** \(S3\). Together, they have: 

-  **Established a new approach to ProBono.Org’s work on the family house** \(S2\). Created new diagnoses \(RF3–RF5\) and working definitions \(especially RF2\) which were taken up by the policy makers, the Provincial Legislature, the judiciary, the lawyers, civil society and select academic experts. The new diagnoses were the result of a co\-authored position paper, which presented Bolt’s research findings \(RO2\) and a closed practitioner forum \(July 2018, S4\). 

-  **Expanded access\-to\-justice advocacy within ProBono.Org**, as the position paper \(RO2\) was adopted and used in service delivery. Bolt’s research\-based recommendations have been used ‘as a resource tool’ with ‘insight into how the many gaps between law and popular norms affect society at an economic and social level’. The position paper \(RO2\) has informed ‘ProBono.Org’s inputs into the land question that currently dominates South Africa’s policy debates’ \(S1; RF1, RF3–RF5\). The paper ‘has not only been invaluable as a resource within ProBono.Org, but also represented a key step in building the Family House Project as a distinct focus in ProBono.Org’s work’ \(S1\). 

  

-  **Ensured public engagement with the research and their collaborative work**. In line with Bolt’s research \(RO2\), ProBono.Org further expanded outreach and advocacy, educating broader audiences on family house issues via joint radio appearances \(discussion/call\-in\) on community and major commercial stations about the position paper  \(RO2\) \(S9\). 

-  **Increased understanding among other stakeholders**. Bolt and Masha developed a policy toolkit \(RO3\) that used Bolt’s key research findings \(RF2, RF6\) to evaluate avenues for the reform of legislation and administrative procedures. It drew on a co\-organised community consultation with 180 township residents, ensuring meaningful stakeholder engagement and advocacy \(February 2019; S4\). Grounded in people’s lived experiences, the toolkit was launched to around 40 government, legal and community stakeholders, including the South African Law Reform Commission \(March 2019\). Attendees emphasised its role in stimulating policy debate and increasing understanding, while the Provincial Legislature delegate underlined its contribution to his work in policy change \(S4\). This led to formal partnership for policy reform with provincial Human Settlements \(S5\). 

 Ultimately, Bolt’s research directly resulted in ‘a change in our approach to the services’ ProBono offers \(S1\), extending beyond legal advice to a major legal reform programme for change in relation to the family house. 

 **2.** <ins> **Stimulating policy debate**</ins> 

 Through ‘longstanding collaboration’ with ProBono.Org, civil society activists and stakeholders, ‘\[Bolt’s\] research has been the basis for a programme to make the law more responsive’ to custom \(S8\). 

-  The research **instigated policy debate** \(S4\) through the position paper \(RO2\), establishing explicit agreement on the themes and problems, and causing stakeholders to request specific avenues for reform \(July 2018; see 1a above\). The Deputy Master of the High Court noted the importance of learning ‘how this \[family house\] concept also affects \[other departments’\] operations and how we can address the challenges collectively’ \(S4\). 

-  This advocacy led the Provincial Legislature to invite Bolt and ProBono.Org to contribute to a **public hearing on a new national Property Practitioners Bill** \(February 2019\). Drawing on Bolt’s research \(RF3–RF5\), they called for recognition of popular practice in property law \(S7, S8\). In the words of the Chairperson: ‘The submission provided important insights into the needs of marginalised people in regulating property practitioners. Having benefited from the points raised, the bill is now in the process of being passed into law’ \(S8\). 

 **3. <ins>Establishing Family House legislation reform as a key priority**</ins> 

 **Family House legislative reform as a priority area** came about as increased policy debate led the Gauteng Province’s Department of Human Settlements to request a formal Memorandum of Understanding and Terms of Reference with Bolt/University of Birmingham and ProBono.Org \(S5, S6\). The MOU is intended ‘to harness the research expertise of Dr Bolt, the legal expertise and reach of the NGO and the constitutional obligations of the Department to: contribute to the development of a policy for the Family House Concept \[… and\] advocate for adoption of the policy’ \(S5\). Under the MOU, the Department responds directly to Bolt’s research, drawing on a panel of legal practitioners to test proposals for concrete change \(S5\). Under its Terms of Reference, the first major milestone \(projected 2021, delayed due to pandemic\) will be to produce a commissioned report that will lead to the Family House’s inclusion in the department’s annual policy agenda \(S6\). 

 The work with Human Settlements, in turn, reinforced the impact of Bolt’s research on ProBono.Org’s practice. In the words of the current National Director: ‘the collaboration with Dr Bolt and the social\-science research insights he brings to ProBono.Org’s clinic expertise have been central to the expansion of our work in legal and policy reform. Building on Dr Bolt’s research to establish a formal partnership with the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements has expanded ProBono.Org’s mission’ \(S1\).

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Over the past 30 years, case\-law on secondary liability has been developed by courts, resulting in wrongful convictions based on “foresight” of an accessory. When Krebs was acting as academic adviser to the appellants in the joint UK Supreme Court and Privy Council case *R v Jogee, Ruddock v The Queen* \(2016\), her research resulted in the overturning of 30 years of case\-law and the abolition of the doctrine of parasitic accessory liability \(PAL\). \[Text removed for publication\]. In addition to the change in English law and Jamaican law \(in the case of Ruddock\), the research has also informed international doctrinal debates and will result in fewer wrongful convictions. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Under JE \(also known as parasitic accessory liability – PAL\), an individual could be held liable for the criminal actions \(crime B\) of his/her associates\-in\-crime which did not form part of their common criminal plan or purpose \(crime A\), provided that the individual had foreseen \(but, controversially, not necessarily intended\) that these might be committed in the context of their agreed scheme. PAL has become particularly controversial in recent years, owing to the number of gang\-related murders and consequent JE convictions. 

 Krebs’ 2015 research \[Section 3, ref 1\] argued that the foresight test in PAL \(where defendants can be convicted if they foresaw that serious violence/murder might take place\) was indefensible and suggested replacing it with a modified version of the more rigorous rules on aiding and abetting \(“ordinary accessory liability” – OAL\), which require intention to assist or encourage serious violence or murder. She put forward two suggestions: that the courts could and should \(a\) abolish PAL and deal with all scenarios of assisting or encouraging via OAL; and \(b\) modify the notion of intention within OAL to accommodate instances where the accessory endorsed the principal’s crime. In other words, she argued for a middle ground between intention \(as then understood\) and foresight. The suggestion was to enlarge the OAL concept of intention to encompass incidents where the evidence suggests that the accessory foresaw and endorsed the perpetrator’s crime. 

 The first suggestion is now reflected in the decision in R v Jogee, which overturned previous longstanding case\-law on JE. However, the extent to which the second suggestion influenced the Supreme Court is unclear. What is clear is that Their Lordships left the precise meaning of intention undefined, leaving it instead to the jury to infer the presence of intent in the mind of the accessory from all the evidence presented at trial, including any evidence suggesting that the accessory must have foreseen that the principal offender might commit the offence. However, not defining intention is unlikely to be sustainable in the long run. 

 Krebs’ subsequent research \[ref 2\] sets out how this approach creates a conflict between the general law of murder and how juries are instructed when assessing the liability for murder of principal offenders on the one hand, and that of accessories on the other. For principal offenders, the law is that juries must not infer that the principal acted with an intention to kill or cause serious injury unless the jury believes that the principal must have foreseen it as virtually certain to occur as a result of his/her actions. In the case of accessories, by contrast, there is no threshold requirement of “virtual certainty”: Jogee permits juries to infer that an accessory intended to assist or encourage murder on the basis of evidence that s/he foresaw death or serious injury as a possible \(not necessarily certain\) consequence of the principal’s actions. It is hoped that the appellate courts will in time pick up on the conflict between the liability thresholds for perpetrators and accessories and resolve it. In her 2018 paper \[ref 2\], Krebs argues that this could be achieved by re\-interpreting the concept of intention in terms of “endorsement”, inviting juries to consider, by looking at all the evidence, whether the accessory had not just foreseen, but had also endorsed the principal’s wrongdoing. 

 Re\-interpreting intention along the lines of endorsement would help streamline the courts’ approach post\-Jogee and prevent diametrically opposed results occurring that might otherwise flow from Jogee’s undefined intention requirement. This is noted by Krebs in case notes \[refs 3 and 4\], which analyse the decisions by the Australian High Court and Final Court of Appeal in Hong Kong to re\-affirm PAL for their own jurisdictions in the aftermath of Jogee. If juries are reluctant to infer intention from evidence of foresight in the degree of a mere possibility, it might in future prove very difficult to convict accessories. This fear led the Australian High Court to reject Jogee and keep PAL \[ref 3\]. By contrast, should juries prove quick to infer intention from evidence of foresight, it might still be substantially easier to convict accessories than actual killers \(as feared by Hong Kong’s top court, which therefore opted to retain its own PAL principles \[ref 4\]\). This fear has been borne out by those historic PAL cases that have to date been re\-examined by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in light of the change of law in Jogee, which suggest that the Court has tended to uphold an inference from foresight to intention, as noted by Krebs in further case notes \[Refs 5 and 6\]. These notes highlight and explain the practical and theoretical difficulties in getting past PAL convictions overturned. 

 Krebs’ research showed how PAL/JE as a legal doctrine was indefensible for accessories to murder. This research resulted in the overturning of a law which had been misinterpreted for 30 years. Her subsequent research highlighted that PAL/JE still makes it easier for juries to convict an accessory of murder than to convict the principal offender \(where the inference of intention requires virtual certainty as opposed to foresight that the principal might kill\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Research conducted by Krebs at Reading has informed a correction of law on PAL/JE and has underpinned a Supreme Court ruling that PAL/JE had been wrongly interpreted for over 30 years. Whereas, before this case, people on the periphery of events leading to someone’s death could all be convicted of murder \(and mandatorily imprisoned for life\), they will now be convicted only if they can be shown to have intended to assist or encourage murder. Foresight is no longer sufficient for a conviction. This is a very significant change in law, which was widely reported in the media and which informed international doctrinal debate. 

 Critics of PAL/JE had referred to it as a “lazy law” because it led to guilt and imprisonment without producing evidence of intent. PAL/JE cases have become increasingly controversial over the years, owing to the large number of gang\-related killings that have come to court. A large proportion of those convicted have been young men of colour, as reported by the Commons Justice Select Committee \(2014\). Krebs’ work is therefore also important in terms of securing racial justice. 

 The change in case\-law applies retrospectively as well as prospectively. It opens up opportunities for those convicted under PAL/JE to argue that they would not have been convicted had the standard for conviction been intention to assist or encourage all along. Therefore, the decision in Jogee has had an important impact on the practice of law and on individuals convicted of JE. For example, John Crilly was the first person to have his JE conviction quashed following the *Jogee* case. Whilst studying for a law degree in prison, he heard about the overturning of the JE law in 2016 and believed it would apply to his case. Since he had not appealed his conviction before, he was able to apply directly to the Court of Appeal for exceptional leave to appeal. This was granted and his appeal on *Jogee* grounds was successful. His murder conviction was quashed and a re\-trial ordered at which he pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Now a reformed prisoner, he attended the Learning Together event \(November 2019\) in London where the London Bridge terror attack started. Crilly was praised for his brave actions in confronting the attacker and minimising further loss of life. 

##  A correction of misapplication in law 

 From September 2015, Krebs acted as academic adviser to Felicity Gerry QC, lead counsel in the UK Supreme Court \(UKSC\) and Privy Council \(PC\) appeal hearing of Jogee/Ruddock \[Section 5, source 1\]. Krebs initially contacted Ms Gerry and sent her a copy of her 2015 CLJ paper \[Section 3, ref 1\], which led to this advisory role and the paper’s citation in written submissions \[source 3\]. Julian Knowles QC \(as he then was\), lead counsel for Ruddock, also cited her 2015 paper in oral submissions \[source 2\]. Krebs was present throughout the hearing and on the day the judgment was handed down. The BBC described the event as “a moment of genuine legal history”. The court’s decision to abolish PAL and replace it with the principles of OAL concurred with what Krebs had argued in her research. Felicity Gerry QC describes Krebs’ research as “instrumental in the presentation of both the above cases” and writes that “the impact of her input cannot be overestimated”. Further, “in order to persuade the Supreme Court to correct the error of law … Krebs’ research, publications and knowledge were invaluable” \[source 3\]. Since then, Krebs has continued working with Felicity Gerry QC and has been involved in preparing submissions for “over a dozen cases on this topic in six \(international\) jurisdictions”, with appeals including R v Johnson \(Asher\) and that of International Criminal Tribunal appeal of former Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic\) \[sources 5 and 3\]. In Gerry’s words, “Dr Krebs’ published research has been invaluable in bringing about all of these outcomes” \[source 3\].

##  Informing international doctrinal debate 

 The change of law brought about by Jogee informed by Krebs’ research has in turn created further international debate in the form of cases being appealed. In the wake of Jogee, both the High Court of Australia and the Hong Kong Final Court of Appeal gave permission to appeal in two cases brought on the basis of the UKSC decision, in which they reconsidered their positions on JE liability at length. Although both courts ultimately decided to keep their respective principles of JE/PAL, it is clear that Krebs’ contribution to legal debate is now international in reach. She has further added to this international debate by editing a collection \[Section 3, ref 7\] which dissects the decision in Jogee, subsequent Court of Appeal decisions and case\-law from other jurisdictions. With chapters contributed by scholars and practitioners from different jurisdictions, all experts in the area of complicity, the book provides the first comprehensive analysis of the implications of Jogee on practice and theory in this and other common law jurisdictions. 

##  Practitioners – Influencing the application of the research in practice 

 Krebs’ work has also informed practitioners. To date, she has published four case notes in the Cambridge Law Journal and the Journal of Criminal Law \[Section 3, refs 3 and 6\] on post\-Jogee cases \(domestic and international\). Two of these have been extensively cited in the leading practitioner textbook Smith, Hogan, and Ormerod’s Criminal Law \(2018\). 

 The law on PAL/JE was misinterpreted by courts for over 30 years. Krebs’ research convinced the Supreme Court to correct this error. It has had significant impact on the practice of law and related decision\-making processes of courts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, where there is potential for the conviction of accessories to a murder. Krebs’ ongoing research reveals the nuances in this area and highlights the difficulties faced by courts in making fair judgements with respect to intent and foresight. Her research has stimulated and informed practitioner debate, and impacted case outcomes on an international scale, making it difficult for courts to wrongfully convict accessories to a crime.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Professor Chris Fox’s Policy Evaluation and Research Unit \(PERU\) has been a pioneering force in the development of innovative, personalised, asset\-based ways of delivering offender rehabilitation in England. Between 2012 and 2020, Fox and his team worked with the service provider ‘Interserve/Purple Futures’ to trial radical new models of offender management \- the largest scale attempt to date to operationalise the desistance literature. Research\-informed reforms were deployed across five Community Rehabilitation Companies \(CRCs\) as part of a GBP650,000,000 contract that collectively covered a quarter of the UK’s population. The collaboration with Interserve led to the development of the *Interchange model*, the *Enablers of Change* assessment tool and the creation of a methodology for devising and evaluation personalised practice. The research has directly changed the rehabilitation of 40,000 offenders and the working practices of 2,000 probation staff. PERU’s research continues to exert a national and international influence; it has been commended by the UK’s Chief Inspector of Probation and has fed into high\-level meetings with the Minister of State for Prisons and Probation. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Through collaboration with key figures in criminal justice \(Caroline Marsh, independent consultant and former National Offender Management Service \(NOMS\) Director\), and social care \(Alex Fox OBE, Chief Executive, Shared Lives\), Prof. Fox recognised that new personalised services emphasising capabilities and assets could be developed to support offender rehabilitation more effectively. In 2013, he co\-authored a conceptual article asking what, if anything, the criminal justice sector could learn from the personalisation of social care **\[1\]**. The question was highly provocative for a sector, in which the public expects to see punishment and risk management as the primary concerns. PERU worked with Interserve plc \(a service provision and construction company\) over several years. Interserve drew on PERU’s research to develop a personalised offender rehabilitation model to implement in five CRCs under its management. The model resonates strongly with ‘desistance theory’, a prominent, yet contentious, criminological theory that has frequently been criticised for its lack of practical application. PERU’s underpinning research in this area is highly original in combining practical application and a robust evidence base with a rigorous conceptual framework, refined from the domain of social care as well as criminology **\[2\]**. 

 Most simply, personalisation means that public services respond to the needs of people rather than service providers. In its more radical forms, it encompasses ‘co\-creation’, an increasingly influential idea in public services often associated with social innovation, where service users work with professionals to design, create and deliver the services they use. A theme in the development of personalised practice in offender rehabilitation has, therefore, been to explore personalisation models as a form of public service co\-creation and social innovation. Working with Professor Sue Baines and other PERU members, Prof. Fox has theorised the role of social innovation and co\-creation in public service reform **\[3, 4\]**. 

 After taking over the management of five CRCs, Fox supported Interserve to develop the *Interchange* case management model. *Interserve* developed a new assessment tool, *Enablers of Change \(*EoC\), based on a personalised \(asset\-based\) approach to offender assessment. Fox and other PERU members \(Wong, Szifris, and Ellison\) advised on the development of EoC and evaluated it **\[5\]**. During 2015 and early 2016, Fox worked with staff at *Interserve* and within the CRCs to develop more radical models of personalisation **.** Drawing upon their work on social innovation **\[3\]** this involved the design, testing and evaluation of a series of small\-scale ‘proof of concept’ pilots in 2017, each involving only one or two probation staff and a handful of clients. Fox led the evaluation of these pilots, and his findings were written up in two reports for *Interserve* and a peer\-reviewed journal article **\[6\]**. 

 Fox, Baines, and Harrison then helped *Interserve* to design a more ambitious pilot involving nine front\-line staff and more than eighty offenders in one CRC. Implemented in 2018\-19, this pilot \- called ‘My Direction’ \- was funded as part of a Horizon 2020 project ‘ *Co\-creation of Service Innovation in Europe*’ \(CoSIE\). PERU undertook evaluation of ‘My Direction’ as well as leading evaluations of co\-creation pilots in nine EU countries.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 *“I have got everything I wanted to get out of probation now. When I first got out of prison and I came here I had nothing. But now I have a job, my daughter is back, I have an amazing girlfriend – my life is back on track.” \(Service User\)* **\[H\].** 

 **Impact on innovating service provision** 

 Prof. Fox’s research on offender rehabilitation has been highly influential in the criminal justice sector. In 2012, he was appointed as an advisor to Interserve plc \(a FTSE 250 company\) and in 2013 his input helped them win five contracts to run CRCs, worth approximately GBP650,000,000. The Managing Director of Interserve’s Justice Division confirms that Fox’s *“evidence\-based approach…provided independent evaluation and advice which assisted us in preparations to the Ministry of Justice”* **\[A\]**. Fox and the research team helped Interserve to develop their *Interchange* model – a completely new approach to offender rehabilitation that moves away from a focus on problems and barriers, and instead focuses on strengths and opportunities, empowering offenders to make better choices and to take individual responsibility **\[B\]**. In 2015, *Interchange* was rolled out across Interserve’s network of CRCs \(West Yorkshire, Humberside, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, Merseyside, Cheshire and Greater Manchester, and Hampshire and the Isle of Wight\), which covered one quarter of the UK’s population,1,900 staff and 38,000 offenders. The model required all staff to work differently as it put the service user at the heart of three interlocking sets of activity: 1\) to interact better with service users, 2\) to deliver better interventions, and 3\) to integrate service users better into their communities. This collaboration represents the largest scale attempt, to date, to operationalise the desistance literature. 

 Reaction to *Interchange* amongst service users and staff was positive. In a 2016 report, service users were quoted as saying: *“I’ve been on probation five times – this is the first time I have really understood what it is all about”,* and “ *My mum passed away when I was 11 and I moved into kids’ homes and started doing crime and basically started going in and out of prison. I think I’ve changed lots. I’ve got more support. All I need now is a job, and probation is helping set me up with opportunities. Because of the support, the friendship I have with my probation officer, I feel motivated.”* Similarly, staff were positive about its introduction whilst acknowledging the challenge of moving to an entirely new approach. *“The Interchange Model focuses on desistance theory and embraces ways of working in which we are encouraged to foster the service user’s strengths. Brilliant\! I want rid of the older models that ask staff to focus on what service users lack.”* and *“The biggest challenge has been the fact that we are currently running two\-systems side\-by\-side as the new structures and ways of working are bedding in…but as we move into the Interchange model I think we are already starting to see some really, really good benefits from Interserve’s approach.”* **\[B\]**. 

  

 **Impact on practice: **Enablers of Change** 

 Beyond *Interchange*, PERU informed Interserve’s implementation of specific elements of desistance\-based delivery **\[C\]**. Notable differences from business\-as\-usual included changes to sentence planning, supervision sessions and risk management. Their practice became more strengths\-based and individualised, with greater emphasis on the service user’s ‘assets’, particularly family and community resources. Mainstream practice changed as a direct result of their research. One outstanding example was the development of a new assessment tool for service users, called ‘ *Enablers of Change*’ **\[D\],** which was approved for deployment across Interserve CRCs by the Ministry of Justice in November 2018. Interserve’s Policy Managers underline the significance of PERU’s research for probation practice, stating: *“Enablers of Change is a significant practice change for probation, since the introduction of OASys \[existing assessment tool\] in 2001. The expertise of Chris \[Fox\], and the team at MMU, have supported us to deliver a complex redesign of assessment, engaging with multiple stakeholders including offenders, case managers, the Ministry of Justice and the Correctional Services Advice and Accreditation Panel.”* **\[E\]**. 

 CRC staff and their supervisees have described the difference *Enablers of Change* made to them. Supervisees valued the co\-produced nature of the process that empowered them to actively contribute to their own assessment. One supervisee summarised the reciprocal nature of co\-produced assessment as follows: *“…it doesn’t feel like it’s your opinion and my opinion”* \(Supervisee 1 in **\[F\]**\). Co\-production resulted in both supervisees and supervisors regarding themselves as legitimate and relevant partners in a mutually\-beneficial process, facilitating engagement by considering and respecting each other’s perspectives, and building trust in their relationship. Many supervisors and supervisees reflected that the *Enablers of Change* assessment elicited a great deal of personal information; supervisors often noted that this was new information \(for those with prior contact and knowledge of a supervisee\). Supervisors also remarked that the *Enablers of Change* assessment and process promoted greater honesty: *“…it’s all very behind closed doors when you are doing an OASys’* \(Supervisor 1 in **\[F\]**\). *Enablers of Change* and its co\-production approach to assessment *“…meant that I was able to be a lot more honest with him than possibly I would have been able to previously”* \(Supervisor 1 in **\[F\]**\). This applied particularly to the area of risk assessment, which had previously been a task carried out in the supervisee’s absence, whereas in the *Enablers of Change* tool it is explored in dialogue with the supervisee **\[F\]**. 

 **A new direction for personalisation in probation** 

 In addition to systemic changes to rehabilitation, Fox and his team also developed more radical models of personalised working that were piloted and evaluated within Interserve’s CRCs. This work started with five ‘proof of concept’ pilot innovations that reached approximately 35 service users and eight staff. These innovations helped staff and service users to co\-produce a rehabilitation plan that gave them access to an ‘enabling fund’. This approach was inspired by cash\-in\-lieu\-of\-services models in social care and was entirely novel in a criminal justice setting. Three of the innovation pilots were implemented successfully and formed the basis of a larger project called ‘My Direction’ that was funded through a Horizon 2020 grant within CoSIE \[G1\], a pan\-European Innovation Action on co\-creation in public services. My Direction confronts the formidable challenge of advancing co\-creation for population groups who typically have services ‘done to them’ without their consent or consultation. During 2018\-19 ‘My Direction’ was trialled in Hull where a series of public\-facing events for the probation service and the wider community drew attention to the potential value of co\-creating services. At the ‘Conversation of Change’ event \(September 2018\), PERU used the findings from the stories of the participants to facilitate a discussion about wider service improvement and personalisation with probation workers \(frontline and management\) and current/ex\-service users. Feedback from participants picked up on the major themes: *“Storytelling confirms my fears that the way probation is organised is very wrong in a moral and practical sense”*, and the event was considered to be an *“amazing opportunity to help try to create change”* **\[G\].** 

 An evaluation by Fox and his colleagues included in\-depth interviews with service users participating in ‘My Direction’, who reported that the new personalisation model had helped them change their lives and that it encouraged trust and generated a more flexible and responsive probation experience: *“She \[Case Manager\] listens to me unlike the others, they never cared. I know she knows I want good and that she believes in me. She knows I am doing well, she has been to my work, she has been to my home and met with my mum.”* \(Service User\) and *“I have never trusted probation in the past because of the way they have treated me – this time around my CM \[Case Manager\] is sound, she listens and is there for me.” \(Service User\)* **\[H\].** This was a view shared by the service providers, who also found the new way of working improved understanding of service user needs: *“I get more information this way in comparison to OASys \[the standard needs assessment used in the sector\]. It is so structured and rigid. This time I have much more insight, it tells me about where he is. It is focused on him, it opens up a conversation.”* \(Case Manager\) and *“When I first started things were rigid. Now it seems that people are more aware of the service user and care more about their life. I think personalisation has been more flexible . . .” \(Case manager\)* **\[H\].** 

 **National impact** 

 The Chief Inspector of Probation highlighted the collaboration between *Interserve* and Manchester Metropolitan University in her national report \(2019\), commending it as a refreshing countermeasure to movements away from evidence\-based practice in probation: *‘Interserve/Purple Futures has been working with Manchester Metropolitan University to pilot and evaluate more innovative approaches to personalised supervision, in line with desistance theory. Refreshingly, the evaluation outlines a methodology for developing and evaluating personalisation work.’* **\[I\]**. 

 Despite substantial Government reform of Transforming Rehabilitation policy, and a late 2019 announcement that probation services were going to be renationalised, PERU’s work on personalisation in criminal justice continues to be influential in the sector. For example, Fox is a member of the Probation and Youth Justice Expert Advisory Group of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation, and Wong is Chair of the Criminal Justice Alliance. Fox was recently invited to a one\-to\-one meeting with the Minister of State for Prisons and Probation \(27<sup>th</sup> February 2020\) to introduce her to PERU’s research, including its approach to personalisation models **\[J\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Humanistic therapies are one of the most widely used approaches to tackling mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. Research led by Professor Mick Cooper has enhanced the effectiveness and reach of these interventions. It has informed **policy** by shaping the development and implementation of counselling interventions in schools and in the voluntary sector. It has influenced **practitioners** through the creation and validation of tools to enhance preference accommodation and support practitioner training. It has supported the dissemination, and improvement, of therapeutic interventions to thousands of **clients**. As a result of Cooper’s research, by 2021, at least 800,000 young people will have received school\-based counselling across the UK, with an estimated 360,000 showing clinical improvement. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A major focus of Cooper’s research is the school\-based counselling field, where humanistic therapy is the most common form of practice in the UK and over 20 countries around the globe. The delivery of school\-based counselling has increased over the last two decades, partly due to the development of evidence – through research led by Cooper – demonstrating its effectiveness. A practice\-based longitudinal study, initiated by Cooper in 2009\-10 at University of Strathclyde and completed at the University of Roehampton \( **R1**\), confirmed that school\-based humanistic counselling is associated with significant reductions in psychological distress and showed, for the first time, that these reductions are of a large magnitude across all clients, not just treatment completers. Subsequent research \( **R2**\) showed that these beneficial effects were maintained up to three months after the end of therapy, in an ethnically diverse sample, and that the economic costs of the intervention could be assessed. 

 To evaluate the effectiveness of non‐statutory counselling services provision outside of the school environment, between 2013 and 2017, Cooper led the first large\-scale systematic evaluation of humanistic counselling for young people in the community and voluntary sector \( **R3**\). Using a common set of measures in accordance with a pre‐defined protocol, this research demonstrated that counselling in the community and voluntary sector is associated with significant reductions in psychological distress, at a level that is equivalent to statutory and school\-based services. Building on this work, Cooper then led the first fully\-powered randomised controlled trial of school\-based humanistic counselling \(ETHOS\) from 2016\-2019, funded by the ESRC \( **G1**\). 

 Cooper contributed to research evaluating the therapeutic potential of a novel virtual reality therapy tool for young people and adults \( **R4**\). This innovative avatar\-based tool, ‘ProReal’, was first evaluated within a prison setting with an adult sample in 2014 using both quantitative and qualitative methods. This showed that ProReal supported therapeutic change among clients: helping them make their thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and experience of the world visible. 

 Across therapeutic settings, it is essential to have psychometrically robust measures of psychological distress. In 2016, Cooper acted as Principal Investigator on research that tested the main outcome measure used for young people in a school setting, the Young Person’s Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation measure \(YP\-CORE; **R5**\). The research demonstrated that this tool is a reliable and valid measure of psychological distress which practitioners can employ with confidence. 

 Cooper’s work in the adult psychotherapy field has focused primarily on developing methods to tailor interventions to the unique preferences of each individual client. Meta\-analyses indicate that this can reduce drop out by approximately 50% and improve clinical outcomes. Cooper carried out research in 2014\-2015, through an online survey with adult mental health professionals and laypeople, to develop a therapy preference tool: the Cooper\-Norcross Inventory of Preferences \(C\-NIP\) \( **R6**\). The research indicated that this brief, 18\-item measure is satisfactory for use in both clinical and research settings.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

1.  **Informing policy** 

 Research undertaken by Cooper has shaped the development and implementation of school\-based counselling in England. His research demonstrating the positive effects of school\-based counselling \( **R1**\), led to Cooper’s appointment as a National Advisor for Counselling for the Children and Young People’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Programme \(CYP IAPT\) at the Department of Health \(DH\)/NHS England until 2016 \( **IMP1**, **IMP2**\). In this role, he spearheaded the development of national guidance, tools and training on the implementation of school\-based counselling in England and brought an evidence\-based perspective to the working of the Programme. In 2014\-2015, Cooper chaired the ‘Integrating CYP Services Task and Finish Group’ for CYP IAPT. Here, he led the development of innovative practices for integration and service user involvement for child mental health services in England, including a new ‘passport’ for young people to use when transitioning between mental health services. This has since been adopted and adapted by Children and Young People’s services at NHS England \( **IMP2**\). Also in 2014\-2015, Cooper Co\-Chaired the ‘Access and Prevention Task and Finish Group’ for the Children and Young People’s Mental Health Taskforce \(NHS England/DH\), producing the 2015 Future in Mind report \( **IMP3**\). This report, informed by Cooper’s evidence\-based perspective, led to the investment of £235 million per annum to increase children and young people’s access to mental health services \( **IMP2**\). A 2018 Children and Young People’s Mental Health Green Paper Transforming children and young people's mental health provision further outlined steps to improve mental health support in schools and colleges, including the aim for every school and college to have a designated lead in mental health by 2025 and the establishment of 123 school\-based Mental Health Support Teams in England \( **IMP2**\). 

 Cooper’s research demonstrating that school\-based counselling can reduce psychological distress in children and young people \( **R1**\) contributed to the decision, by NHS England and Health Education England, to commission an Evidence\-Based Counselling Curriculum for training NHS professionals \( **IMP1**\). Cooper co\-led the development of the curriculum in 2015\-2016. Cooper’s research also supported, and informed, the development of the Department for Education’s 2016 advice Counselling in Schools: A Blueprint for the Future \( **IMP4**\). This guidance, which draws on Cooper’s research findings around the effectiveness of school\-based counselling \( **R1**, **R2**\), has become a ‘go\-to’ document for schools, colleges and counselling services \( **IMP5**\). As the Children, Young People and Families Lead at the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy \(BACP\) affirms, this guidance has ‘established school\-based counselling as a legitimate activity and key intervention to support young people’s mental health’ and this has in turn ‘enabled commissioners and providers to refer to an evidence\-based framework, clearly setting out standards and expectations that help to embed counselling as a separate, yet integrated provision in educational settings across the nation’ \( **IMP5**\). 

 In 2020, Cooper conducted research with the BACP Policy and Public Affairs Department to establish that, following the implementation of COVID\-19 restrictions, the number of children and young people receiving school counselling halved \( **IMP5**\). These findings, drawing on Cooper’s earlier research \( **R1**, **R2**\), have contributed to BACP’s campaign for further government investment in school counselling. The campaign resulted in over 3,000 letters being sent to MPs calling for government funding for school counselling and led to an Early Day Motion being tabled before the House of Commons by the Labour MP for Hemsworth in September. In response, 34 parliamentary questions were tabled during the period up until December; and in October 2020, Baroness Massey referenced the briefing incorporating Cooper’s research during a House of Lords debate on Children and Young People’s Mental Health \( **IMP5**\). 

1.  **Influencing practitioners** 

 Cooper’s research has been fundamental to the development of national guidance around the practice of school\-based counselling in England. Evidence of its benefits \( **R1**\) were ‘instrumental in the commissioning of the “MindEd Counselling” e\-learning programme for counsellors working with children, young people, and young adults’, attests the former Chair of the BACP \( **IMP1**\). This free resource, launched in 2014, draws on Cooper’s research demonstrating the effectiveness of humanistic counselling in schools \( **IMP2**\). *MindEd Counselling* has been accessed by 71,405 registered users between April 2017 and July 2020 across five continents \(Europe, Africa, Asia, North America, South America\), with a total of 71,914 session launches, 32,210 session completions, and 27,837 hours of learning completed \( **IMP1**\). This evidenced\-based training resource has led to direct benefits for practitioners, including ‘increased confidence and better awareness in issues linked to children and young people’s mental health as well as introducing creative problem\-solving techniques to look at some of the challenging situations that are presented within counselling’ \( **IMP5**\). 

 Cooper’s research demonstrating the positive outcomes of the humanistic counselling avatar\-based intervention, ProReal \( **R4**\), has also supported its growth and dissemination for young people. ProReal’s Chief Executive credits Cooper’s research as ‘instrumental to our move into the Education sector’ from 2016, as it provided an evidence\-based assessment of the use of the technology in UK secondary schools and demonstrated that it was ‘acceptable and even attractive to clients and was particularly helpful for young males’ \( **IMP6**\). The research has directly supported ProReal’s growth, with the service now offered as an adjunct to treatment provided by the Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust CAMHS team and Off the Record, a youth counselling charity in Bristol. In January 2020, ProReal set up ‘MiHUB’, a project that aims to support young people’s wellbeing through virtual reality, in partnership with Wiltshire Council and Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire Clinical Commissioning Group. Cooper’s research played a key role in the establishment of this project as it ‘enabled us to illustrate to our project partners that the ProReal tool is effective and supported by evidence’ \( **IMP6**\). 

 Self\-report tools for monitoring outcomes in adolescent counselling and psychotherapy are limited, and existing tools are often lengthy, based on diagnostic criteria, and/or oriented to US respondents. Cooper’s contribution to the development of the Young Person’s Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation \(YP\-CORE\) measure – and the research demonstrating that this tool provides a psychometrically robust assessment of psychological distress in young people \( **R5**\) – has also helped facilitate the widespread uptake of this brief, standardised outcome measure by practitioners. Since 2014, the YP\-CORE has been used with over 100,000 young people in the UK and internationally. It has been adopted across Wales to evaluate school\-based counselling services \( **IMP5**\). The YP\-CORE has shaped the way counselling services have been commissioned across the UK and has become the most\-widely used measure for evaluating such services. As such, it has provided essential evidence of the benefits of school\-based counselling; and has supported the commissioning, funding and delivery of these services \( **IMP5**\). 

 Cooper’s Inventory of Psychotherapy Preferences \(C\-NIP\), a new therapy preference tool developed from his research \( **R6**\), has provided practitioners with a means of systematically assessing their clients’ preferences and tailoring their therapeutic work accordingly. The C\-NIP has been adopted by therapists working in a range of clinical settings in the UK and US. A psychotherapist at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, UK states, ‘By engaging with the C\-NIP, I have observed a more rapid establishment of a therapeutic alliance between client and therapist \[and\] the possibility of avoiding some dispiriting ruptures through a heads\-up of potential pitfalls earlier in the work’ \( **IMP7**\). Since August 2020, the C\-NIP tool has also been adopted by Marvin—a US\-based mental health support company—with 100 clients across four major hospitals in California and Massachusetts. As their Co\-Founder and CEO attests: ‘The C\-NIP has been extremely impactful: both in terms \[of\] helping us to match each client with a provider, and helping each provider to understand their client’s therapeutic preferences’ \( **IMP8**\). These practitioner improvements have in turn led to clinical and reputational benefits for Marvin: ‘our client retention has increased and client satisfaction has significantly increased since using the C\-NIP’ and ‘use of the C\-NIP has also improved our standing with our hospital partners and increased our ability to build long\-term contractual relationships’ \( **IMP8**\). The C\-NIP has a dedicated website through which the tool can be completed by clients and an interpretation of responses is provided. It has been translated into eight languages, with an estimated 3,000 clients having used the measure since its inception in 2015. 

 Cooper’s research demonstrates that humanistic counselling for young people offered in the community and voluntary sector is effective in reducing psychological distress \( **R3**\), and it has shaped the ability of the third sector to support young people. Youth Access—the UK’s lead organisation providing young people’s information, advice, and counselling services \(YIACS\)— used Cooper’s research to enact policy change and successfully bid for vital funds. The Chief Executive states that Cooper’s evaluation was ‘instrumental in securing a commitment in the NHS Long Term Plan to develop age\-appropriate mental health models for young adults and to recognise the vital role that voluntary and community sector services play in bridging crucial gaps in provision for at\-risk young adults’ \( **IMP9**\). Youth Access also used the research to directly support several successful major funding bids, including a grant of £1.4m from the National Lottery Community Fund to develop access to YIACS across the UK and a grant of £1m from the Department of Culture, Media, and Sport to improve access to mental health support for young women, and BAME women in particular \( **IMP9**\). 

1.  **Improvement of therapeutic interventions for clients** 

 Cooper’s research regarding the effectiveness of an avatar\-based tool for supporting humanistic counselling has led to direct patient benefits. Approximately 4,000 children and young people have now used the ProReal tool \( **IMP6**\). The tool may be particularly useful for counselling clients who have trouble expressing themselves verbally. For example, one school counsellor attests that ‘with ProReal she \[one pupil\] could show her anger and be her anger… After using ProReal she was much calmer, it was her being allowed to express herself.’ A Senior Mental Health Professional with the NHS Trust reported the usefulness of the tool in assessment, and for patients. ProReal’s Chief Executive attributes these successful patient outcomes to Cooper’s research \( **IMP6**\). 

 Cooper’s impacts on policy and practitioners have had deep and pervasive consequences for young people’s access to, and benefit from, humanistic counselling interventions in schools. School\-based counselling is now delivered in all publicly funded secondary schools in Wales and Northern Ireland \(approximately 380 schools\) and in around 70% of schools in England and Scotland. The former Advisor for School\-Based Counselling within the Department of Education \(DE\) in Northern Ireland \(NI\), states: ‘The DE were greatly influenced in their decision\-making by the positive outcomes your research identified’ \( **IMP10**\). Cooper’s body of research demonstrating school\-based counselling reduces young people's psychological distress \( **R1**, **R2**\) was subsequently used by the DE to successfully bid for continued funding from the NI Government, leading to increased access to counselling interventions for children and young people in NI: ‘Substantiated by your research findings, during the 15 years the service has been available, an estimated 15,000 students across 230 post primary school settings, including 25 Educated other than at School settings, have now benefited from the school based counselling interventions.’ \( **IMP10**\). As the Children, Young People and Families Lead at the BACP attests, Cooper’s research ‘and its impact on policy and practitioners have had a significant influence on young people’s ability to access humanistic counselling interventions in schools’ \( **IMP5**\). She adds that, as a consequence of Cooper’s research, between 2014 and 2021 ‘approximately 800,000 young people will have received school\-based counselling across the UK’ and concludes, ‘Based on predicted recovery rates, approximately 360,000 of these young people will have moved from clinical to non\-clinical levels of psychological distress \(though 80,000 will also have moved from non\-clinical levels to clinical levels\). As such, your research has directly contributed to the alleviation of psychological distress in thousands of young people in the UK’ \( **IMP5**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research undertaken at the University of South Wales \(USW\) has developed novel understandings of mechanisms and interventions that enhance effective service provision in sport \(e.g., reflective practice; biofeedback\). These have been significant in substantially changing and improving: **\(a\)** nationally and internationally recognised professional education qualifications \(FAW/UEFA coaching licences; BASES Sport & Exercise Science Accreditation\); and **\(b\)** the preparation of those performing at major international sporting competitions \(Commonwealth / Olympic Games\). Between 2014 and 2020, our research has directly influenced the service delivery of over 4000 coaches working in Wales, over 100 elite football coaches working across the World, over 100 sport science support staff, and the performance of over 100 Sport Wales international elite athletes \(influencing medals won\). Beyond sport, our research has also been used to construct new approaches to workforce development for approximately 800 staff members at Coleg\-y\-Cymoedd. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2014, researchers at USW have worked closely with government agencies, national governing bodies of sport \(NGBs\), and education providers \(e.g., The Football Association of Wales Trust \[FAWT\]; British Association of Sports and Exercise Sciences \[BASES\]; Sport Wales; UK Coaching; Coleg\-y\-Cymoedd\) to conduct research that informs best practice in the development and performance of professional practitioners and athletes. Indeed, in concert with European Knowledge, Economy, Skills Scholarships \(KESS\), Sport Wales and the FAWT have separately funded PhD studentships in this area to Shearer \(2016, 2020\) and Cropley \(2018\), totalling £158,952 **\[9, 10, 11\]**, with the aim of producing translational research that improves practice in the respective organisations. This research has focused on 3 key areas: 

1.  **Enhancing professional practice through reflective practice** 

 Whilst reflective practice has been widely advocated as a process of experiential learning, a lack of knowledge and understanding has hindered its integration into the domain of sport. Research conducted at USW has systematically developed an understanding of the efficacy and practice of reflection for professional development in the context of sport. Most recently, Cropley’s 2017\-2020 research has demonstrated that reflective practice facilitates positive adaptations to a range of personal \(e.g., hardiness\) and interpersonal \(e.g., communication\) characteristics that help to augment the effectiveness of sport science and coaching service delivery **\[1, 2\]**. Further, Cropley’s \(2020\) novel longitudinal research **\[1\]** using a single subject multiple\-baseline intervention design, has facilitated a better understanding of how the skills required for reflective practice can be effectively taught and integrated into professional education programmes across a variety of sectors \(e.g., sport; education\) through the use of multi\-modal interventions \(e.g., mentoring, communities of practice, formative feedback\). 

1.  **Improving elite coach and athlete preparation for performance** 

 It is well known in the field that the psychological preparation of coaches, support staff, and athletes has been demonstrated as a predictor of successful performance in competitive events. Consequently, NGBs persistently strive to implement the most effective approaches to help individuals cope with the demands that such situations create. In attempts to aid Sport Wales in such endeavours, over the last six years, Shearer’s research **\[3, 4\]** has sought to help to inform best practice regarding the preparation of performers. Supported by a number of research grants **\[7, 8, 9\]**, his work, which entailed direct engagement with Sport Wales’ practicing sport psychologists, international coaches and elite athletes, identified performance decrements at major events were often caused by poor emotional awareness and attentional focus due to the stress\-related demands of competition. Subsequently, his research has shown that simple biofeedback techniques, which provide real\-time feedback of how the body’s physiology responds under stress and during controlled resonant frequency breathing, can be used as an effective tool to prepare performers to deal with the pressures encountered at major world\-level sporting events \(e.g., Olympic Games\). Specifically, simple, brief, and bespoke breathing interventions were shown to increase heart rate variability, the use of somatic control strategies under pressure \(e.g., controlled breathing\) and impacted emotional control before and during performance and in domains outside sport \(e.g., home life\). 

1.  **Exploring sport as a vehicle for life skill development in young people** 

 Sport has been advocated as a domain in which people can learn transferrable skills \(e.g., reflective practice; emotional control\) that will help them to function effectively in all areas of their lives. These skills are thought to be key facilitators of sporting performance that compliment sport\-specific skills, allowing individuals to cope with the demands \(e.g., micro\-politics\) associated with competitive sport. However, little is known about how life skills are developed through sport. Using a rigorous systematic review **\[6\]** and applied intervention research design **\[5\]**, Bowley and Cropley found that life skills are taught and not caught through sport participation alone. Consequently, they examined the impact of an education programme that focused on improving coaches’ ability to facilitate life skills development through football. Funded by KESS and the FAWT \(£72,000 PhD funding\), Bowley and Cropley’s work has informed a key element of coach education across FAWT and UEFA coaching qualifications, and consequently influenced coaching practice across Wales to enhance the personal development of players.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In pursuit of developing best practice and sporting excellence, our research has informed improvements in the education and performance of coaches, support staff and athletes nationally and internationally. 

 **The development of best practice in sport practitioner education and professional development:** 

1.  **The Football Association of Wales Trust \[FAWT\]** 

 Cropley and Bowley’s research has been used by the NGB for football in Wales \(FAWT\) to inform the development of their National Syllabus **\[b\]**, which underpins the FAWT coach education portfolio. This syllabus guides national youth development and enriches the content of the coach education programmes offered by the FAWT. All coaches \(between 4000 and 7000 coaches per year from 2015\-2020\) engaging in these programmes are, therefore, exposed to the recommendations presented in the National Syllabus **\[a\]**. 

 Bowley and Cropley’s research **\[5, 6\]** has resulted in the creation of modules designed to educate coaches how to integrate life skills development into their coaching practice. These modules are embedded into the curricula of the FAWT Level 1 and Level 2 awards, and delivered to \~2000 coaches \(400 per annum from 2015\-2020 **\[a\]**\), with many coaches indicating that the research\-informed modules have facilitated improvements to their practice – “ *We have found that many of our coaches have reported substantial developments in their coaching practice as a result of being exposed to Brendan’s work*” \(FAWT Technical Director **\[a\]**\). Additionally, Cropley’s research into reflective practice **\[1, 2\]** has been used to develop modules on Levels 2\-5 \(C Certificate to Professional Licence\) of coach education offered by the FAWT, which have been delivered to \~1980 coaches since the qualifications were re\-written between 2017\-2020 **\[a\]** – these qualifications include those ratified by UEFA \(the NGB for football in Europe\). This research has also informed the way coaches are asked to engage in reflective practice during their coach education journeys and has significantly influenced coaches’ attempts to improve the effectiveness of their practice, *“Brendan’s research has really helped to facilitate the quality of my reflective practices, which I believe has helped me to become a more effective coach. His work has had a considerable effect on my work”* \(EFL Championship Coach, 2017; **\[a\]**\). Approximately 10% of the candidates on the UEFA accredited licences delivered by FAWT attend from overseas’ NGBs \(\~130 coaches between 2017\-2020\). This widens the reach of our impact to an elite international audience, with many of these coaches working in the highest leagues in their respective countries \(e.g., La Liga, Spain\) **\[a\]**. In support of this impact, the FAWT Technical Director detailed: “ *We have witnessed significant changes in coaches’ practice and education and in player development, which have occurred at least in part because of the integration of the evidence Brendan has developed through his research*” **\[a\]**. 

1.  **British Association of Sports and Exercise Sciences \[BASES\] and UK Coaching** 

 Cropley’s research **\[1, 2\]** has been used to create a number of resources and Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) programmes to support the ongoing development of coaches’ reflective practices across a range of sports **\[d, e\]**. Collectively, these have supported a “ *huge step forward in coach education*” **\[f\]** and have been distributed to a worldwide audience via NGB websites, which have been accessed by over 400 coaches in 2020 **\[e\]**. More specifically, Cropley’s research **\[1, 2\]** has been used to re\-design the core Reflective Practice workshop on the BASES \(the UK’s leading governing body for Sport & Exercise Science\) Supervised Experience programme **\[c\]**. Between 2017\-2020, 100 trainees on the programme have been educated using content underpinned by Cropley’s research. As this workshop is core, every future trainee who participates in the programme \(and often go on to work in elite sport\) will also be impacted by Cropley’s work. Feedback from participants showed the workshop had a profound influence on many of the candidates’ abilities to engage in reflective practice, which is likely to augment the quality of their service delivery: “ *I’m going to reflect so differently now based on what I’ve seen \[during the workshop\] and I’m sure that this will make my reflections more critical, which will have a huge impact … and improve what I do*” \(Anonymous, 2019 **\[c\]**\). The influence of this research on practitioner development was further recognised by BASES who awarded Cropley and colleagues an Expert Statement Grant \(£1000\) in 2019 to summarise the key findings from research relating to reflective practice and support the development of service delivery across the sport and exercise sciences disciplines **\[d\]**. This statement was distributed to the 2561 professional and student members of the organisation. 

1.  **Coleg\-y\-Cymoedd** 

 Finally, the impact of Cropley’s research in sport has been recognised outside of the sport domain by Coleg\-y\-Cymoedd, one of the largest tertiary education colleges in Wales. Since 2017, the college has utilised Cropley’s research in order to design and implement a staff CPD programme underpinned by reflective practice, resulting in the education of \~800 academic and support staff **\[g\]**. This has fundamentally changed the way that the college seeks to improve academic service delivery. This is confirmed by the college’s Vice Principal: “ *\[Cropley’s research\] links directly to what we wanted to achieve at the college; namely a reflective workforce who are able to address the effectiveness of their practice. Consequently, the links that Brendan has made … have been impactful for us … we have seen explicit improvements in staff engagement in reflective practice, which is fundamentally altering the way in which they work*” **\[f\]**. 

 **The development of best practice in applied performance psychology:** 

1.  **Sport Wales** 

 Shearer’s research **\[3, 4\]** has developed via two funded industrial collaborations with Sport Wales that began in 2014, the most recent of which saw the formation of the Welsh Institute of Performance Science \(WIPS: funding secured till 2024\). WIPS now act as the research arm of Sport Wales and, as a founding member, Shearer’s work was driven directly by the needs of Sport Wales and Team Wales to improve workforce \(e.g., coach, athlete\) performance, and focused on the preparation of athletes for elite\-level, international, multisport games \(e.g., Commonwealth Games 2014 and 2018; Olympic Games 2016 and 2020\). The impact of this research is international by the nature of the international level of competition experienced by athletes and coaches **\[h, i\]**. Shearer’s research has shown that biofeedback techniques can be used to effectively prepare coaches, support staff and athletes for elite competition by enhancing their competition\-coping and decision\-making skills **\[3, 4\]**. This has resulted in the delivery of in\-house training workshops to all Welsh Commonwealth Sports, and adoption of the psychophysiology techniques detailed in the research by the sport psychology delivery team at Sport Wales in support of their athletes **\[h\]**. In particular, the methods were used to psychologically prepare over 100 elite athletes \(with great effect\) by a number of coaches at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014, and Gold Coast 2018 where Team Wales had their best ever medal performances at an international level in succession **\[h, i\]**. For the Gold Coast 2018 games in particular, these stress\-management methods were used to directly intervene with 20% of Wales’ medallists, including 30% of Wales’s gold medallists – “ *The intervention \[biofeedback\] … helped them to remain in control during pressure situations … These marginal gains in emotion control and subsequent behaviour/behaviour can often distinguish between winning a medal or not*” \(Assistant Director Sport System Strategy and Services, Sport Wales Institute, Sport Wales **\[h\]**\). 

1.  **Swim Wales** 

 Similarly, Shearer’s work with Swim Wales \(2016\-2020\) has helped Welsh swimmers to prepare for the psychological factors encountered during the taper period in the lead\-in to competition **\[j\]**. Swim Wales and Sport Wales psychologists identified that Welsh medals had been lost at major international competitions through poor psychological adaption during this stressful time in the swimmers’ and coaches’ preparation. This industry\-driven problem, endorsed by WIPS, resulted in Shearer receiving KESS funding **\[9\]** to research and implement a biofeedback intervention to improve emotional regulation during the taper period before an important competition. Since 2018, the research has been integrated into the service delivery of the sport science support team \(e.g., psychologists, S&C coaches; *n* = 7\) and sport coaches \( *n* = 18\) working with Swim Wales **\[i\]**, and has subsequently resulted in a change to the competition culture of Swim Wales, from grassroots to elite international competition. The National Performance Director of Swim Wales has stated: “ *This research has had a significant impact on the way in which we view and plan for the implementation of the taper at all level of swimmer development”* **\[i\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research undertaken at the University of Chester \(UoC\) has directly impacted conservation strategies and policy\-making at local, national and international levels. Our research has informed the evaluation of the conservation status of various wildlife species: i.e. the inclusion of Alpine ibex \( *Capra ibex*\) in the new ‘Green Status of Species’ framework of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) and the “Favourable Conservation Status” document for the conservation of natterjack toads \( *Epidalea calamita*\) in the UK. Research outputs produced at UoC, have also been used as evidence in support of national and international legislation: i.e. the maintenance of the fishing ban for sea cucumbers along the Egyptian coast of the Red Sea; the enforcement of international trade restrictions for thresher sharks \( *Alopiidae*\) under CITES Appendix II and amendments to the UK Agriculture Act 2020 to allow semi feral ponies to be used in Public Payment for Public Goods schemes. Finally, our research has contributed to the improvement of local habitat management plans, benefitting the long\-term conservation of natterjack toads in the Gronant Dunes and Talacre Warren SSSI, Wales and thresher sharks in the Philippines. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 At the beginning of the last REF period in 2014\-15, the Department of Biological Sciences at UoC, started a considerable investment in the recruitment of new research active academic staff members with the vision to develop and expand its research and teaching activities in the field of conservation biology. This follows the explicit research strategy of the Department to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations by producing impactful scientific evidence informing conservation action and policy making both at the national as well as at the international level. While the Conservation Biology Research Group at UoC is relatively young, the deliberate strategy by the department to support and incorporate the previously started long\-term research projects lead by the newly recruited staff paid off and allowed, in a short time, the production of novel impactful research outputs. 

 The research group lead by Anna Muir \(AM\) has recently published some unexpected results on the conservation genetics of the natterjack toad, a rare Priority Species under the UK Post\-2010 Biodiversity Framework. Their study \[R1\] showed that translocated Natterjack populations suffer strong inbreeding but are maintaining low but stable populations sizes, nevertheless. This is against expectations but suggests that populations may start to decline in the future. The study highlights the importance of long\-term genetic monitoring of reintroduced populations and has implications for their management. The research recommends the implementation of genetic rescue \(i.e. the supplementation of populations with further individuals to increase the genetic pool\) in these populations to reduce inbreeding and thus guard against a future population declines. 

 Research on semi\-feral ponies conducted by Christina Stanley \(CS\), started before she joined UoC in 2015, culminated with a collaborative perspectives paper in 2019 on the role semi\-feral ponies play in the conservation management of natural grasslands \[R2\]. This research is based on both evidence in the literature, including work by CS on Carneddau ponies in Wales, and novel analyses of genetic data. It strongly suggests that the specific physiological and behavioural adaptations of native ponies to a feral life, which are shaped by natural selection rather than by artificial selection, make them particularly suited to conservation grazing programmes as a more viable alternative to cattle with whom they share a largely overlapping dietary niche. This would support the preservation of equine genetic lineages currently at risk of extinction by increasing their value as a public good, alongside their recognised cultural heritage value. 

 The ongoing long term research program on the conservation of Alpine ibex started by Achaz von Hardenberg \(AvH\) while working for the Gran Paradiso National Park \(GPNP\) in Italy and for which he continued to take a leading role after joining UoC in 2015 \(and currently jointly supported financially with a Sustainable Futures PhD grant by the UoC and GPNP\), recently culminated in a thorough and timely assessment of the global distribution and conservation status of this species \[R3\]. While Alpine ibex is currently considered Least Concern under the IUCN Red list of species, it was on the brink of extinction in the 19th Century, with less than 100 individuals known in the area. Thanks to sustained reintroduction efforts in the second half of last century, the Alpine ibex is once again distributed across its whole original range on the Alpine Arch \(ranging from France in the Western Alps to Slovenia in the Eastern Alps\), with an estimated global population of 51,157\-62,710 individuals \[R3\]. 

 Simon Oliver \(SO\) has led studies on the behavioural ecology and conservation of rare and endangered \(IUCN Red List\) pelagic thresher sharks in the Philippines as part of a long\-term research programme that he began prior to joining UoC in 2014. Pelagic thresher sharks are an important tourism attraction for SCUBA divers that visit Cebu Province, and contribute significantly to the local economy on Malapascua Island. A recent investigation undertaken by SO on the fine scale movements of pelagic thresher sharks shows how the sharks leave a shallow coastal seamount in the Central Visayan Sea where they are protected to cross trans\-jurisdictional borders in the Philippines. These movements make pelagic thresher sharks vulnerable to fisheries on a daily basis \[R4\]. 

 Since 2002, a long\-term research project led by Andrew Lawrence \(AL\), in collaboration with partners in Egypt on the sustainable exploitation of sea cucumbers in the Red Sea has highlighted that the future value of sea cucumbers as a source of bioactive substances of potential medical use might be higher than the immediate use value provided by fisheries, supporting the urgent need for continued protection of the remaining, but already over\-exploited stocks. These earlier studies have led to a molecular re\-examination of the species occurring in the Egyptian Red Sea, which may be linked to the production of these bioactive substances \[R5\]. The original work developed a number of bioassays which found strong activity against Candida, leishmania parasites and two cancer cell lines from certain sea cucumber species in specific parts of their range. While this research began while AL was employed at a different institution, the collaboration continued after he joined UoC in 2012 as demonstrated by follow up studies in which the bioactive substances were purified and finally identified as saponins \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Conservation biology is a relatively new discipline with a strong applied focus. Ultimately, to have a measurable impact, it is crucial that the scientific evidence gained by conservation biologists goes beyond the remits of academic discourse to reach decision makers shaping policies affecting the conservation of biodiversity. The Conservation Biology Research Group in the Department of Biological Sciences at UoC has systematically worked towards the goal of having a positive impact on the conservation of wildlife and the sustainable use of natural resources by making sure their research informs new policies and conservation strategies. This has been facilitated by the strategy of the group to promote and strengthen existing and new collaborations and partnerships with the organisations and people at the frontline of applied conservation, i.e. governmental agencies and international organisations such the International Union for the conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) and the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, protected areas such as the Gronant Dunes and Talacre Warren SSSI in the UK and the Gran Paradiso National Park in Italy and conservation NGOs such as Save Philippine Seas, the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust and the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association. This coordinated effort resulted in strong and lasting impacts on policies, official assessments of the conservation status of species and targeted conservation actions. on a large range of species and geographical scales. 

 <ins> *National and international impacts on policy*</ins> 

 Major impacts on conservation policies directly stemmed from the research work by CS on the use of semi\-feral ponies for conservation grazing schemes in the UK, by SO on pelagic thresher sharks in the Philippines and by AL on sea cucumbers in Egypt. The work by CS was instrumental to support arguments brought forward by the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association \[S1\] in a petition to the House of Commons Agriculture Bill Committee 2020 in November 2019, to ensure that semi\-feral native ponies, which do not fall under any recognised breed society, would not be excluded from future conservation grazing programmes in the proposed system for Public Payment for Public Goods schemes. As a result of the petition \[S2\], which specifically cites the work co\-authored by CS \[R2\], the wording of the Agriculture Bill 2019\-21 \(Published on the 16th January 2020\) was changed removing the word “breed” when referring to equids used in conservation grazing. The bill finally got Royal Assent on the 11th November 2020, becoming the Agriculture Act 2020 \[S3\]. This seemingly minor change, has important consequences for the future preservation of rare and endangered genetic lineages of semi feral ponies such as the Dartmoor Hill Ponies in England and the Carneddau Mountain Ponies in Wales. Including semi\-feral ponies in conservation grazing payment schemes, provides economic incentives for the maintenance of their populations as well as for the creation of satellite populations in other areas in which conservation grazing schemes are active, as a viable alternative to the use of cattle or domestic breeds of ponies. Satellite feral pony populations could serve as ‘insurance policy’ in the case of catastrophic events in the founder populations \[R2\]. On an international level, the body of knowledge produced by SO’s broad research on thresher sharks \[see references in R4\] was fundamental to shaping the arguments that were presented at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES \(CoP17\) which was held in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2016. Data generated from fieldwork by SO provided essential empirical evidence to support assertions that international trade in thresher sharks should be regulated. The CITES delegates were convinced, and international trade in thresher sharks is now CITES regulated under Appendix II \[S4\]. Finally, the work by AL on the sustainable use of sea cucumbers in the Egyptian Red Sea was crucial to securing a complete ban on the fishery of sea cucumbers and in maintaining this ban to the present day \[S5\]. The original projects involved research to develop community\-based mariculture systems for sea cucumber to offset fishing and research into possible bioactivities in certain key species. The results from the survey work and failure of work to develop a mariculture system, led to the original bans on the fishery in 2003 and 2008. It also resulted in the training of Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency \(EEAA\) Rangers in the survey monitoring techniques, which continue annually and have failed to show any recovery in commercial stocks to the present time. However, the bioactivity work and the recent work published in 2018, isolating and identifying the bioactive compounds of potential medical use \[R6\], further strengthened the evidence for the potential future value of sea cucumbers and their continued need for protection. This, together with the survey reports from by the previously trained EEAA Rangers, has been instrumental in the decision by the authorities to maintain the fishing ban to the present day \[S5\]. 

 <ins> *Impacts on the assessments of the conservation status of species*</ins> 

 The evaluation of the conservation status of species, is a crucially important tool used by decision makers in the assessment of conservation priorities and drafting of new policies. The Conservation Biology Research Group at UoC contributes to this important exercise both at the national as well as on the international level. On an international level, the research presented in the recent paper co\-authored by AvH on the distribution and conservation status of Alpine ibex \[R3\], made it possible for Alpine ibex to be one of the very first species to be assessed and to be included in the new “Green Status of Species” list of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) \[S6\]. The “Green Status of Species” list was developed by IUCN as a complement to the widely known “Red list of Threatened Species” to objectively assess the recovery of species and thus the impact of conservation actions. The final aim of this new tool, which has now been tested, validated and approved by IUCN, is to significantly impact decision\-making and policy enhancement by providing an optimistic vision for the conservation of species. The Green Status assessment itself was written by AvH together with an international team of other Alpine ibex specialists \[S7\]. Due to its example as best practice in applying the Green Status of Species criteria and providing thorough documentation, it was chosen by the coordinator of the IUCN Species Conservation Success Task Force as a model assessment to guide the formatting of assessments for online display \[S7\]. On a national level, the research conducted by AM and her collaborators on the conservation genetics of natterjack toads has been confirmed for inclusion in the UK\-wide “Favourable Conservation Status” document for natterjack toads compiled by the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust together with Natural England and Natural Resources Wales \[S8\]. It informed the “Favourable Conservation Status” document that conservation actions are required to support translocated populations, potentially via translocation of further individuals to augment genetic variation, and highlights the importance of ongoing genetic monitoring. This has promoted management actions that aim to increase the number of breeding females to 25,000 individuals by 2030, including at sites of previous local extinctions. 

 <ins> *Impacts on conservation actions*</ins> 

 Besides impacting policies and the assessment of the conservation status of species, our research in conservation biology has had also direct impacts on conservation actions with immediate beneficial effects on the targeted species and environments. The research by AM has strongly informed directions for management of the Gronant Dunes and Talacre Warren SSSI, which hosts the only population of natterjack toads in Wales \[S9\]. The creation of new ponds for the natterjack toad population at this site have been agreed. The impact of this is that the carrying capacity of sites is increased to reduce inbreeding risk and increase population sizes in order to reach the Favourable Conservation Status targets. The research has also informed a recent successful funding bid \(£7000\) to the Welsh Government Sustainable Management Scheme for the creation of a new lined pond to secure reproduction sites in time of drought. The work for this funding was started in the winter of 2020. Finally, AM’s research findings have influenced the annual training programme for surveyors and volunteers \(around 20 individuals per year\) such that the monitoring effort is increased in order to detect population declines as a result of low genetic diversity and they are summarised in the 2020 Annual Talacre Natterjack Toad report produced by Eni UK Ltd \(custodian and manager of the SSSI\) and shared with Natural Resources Wales & the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust \[S9\]. On the international level, besides AL contribution to securing a fishing ban for sea cucumbers in Egypt, further project work was undertaken to develop a mariculture system for sea cucumber with funding from the Egyptian Science & Technology Development Fund \(2016\) and for which AL was part of the research team. This project established the first marine commercial invertebrate hatchery in Egypt which will help in the maximisation of invertebrate production to help in Egypt’s Strategic Agriculture Plan for 2030. It trained at least 100 stakeholders in aquaculture techniques and established the first Egyptian gene bank for preservation of genetic diversity of commercial and non\-commercial invertebrates in Egypt \[S10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Keele’s Virtual 3D Artefact Reconstruction and Interaction software and systems comprise novel interactive web\-based 3D artefact interfaces, a low\-cost portable 3D acquisition system with automated workflow, a joining algorithm for virtual artefact reconstruction \(from previous research\) and novel Augmented Reality \(AR\) museum apps for creating interactive 3D artefact exhibitions. The software and systems have impacts in Assyriology, archaeology, digital heritage, outreach and public engagement. They have been used to virtualise 3D photo\-realistic museum artefacts, via online interactive interfaces and AR apps, that would not otherwise be accessible, and have been used to achieve the world’s first long\-distance virtual artefact reconstruction that joined together fragments of the famous Atrahasis epic, held 1000km apart in Geneva and in The British Museum. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Within the scope of the impact case the research is underpinned by software and systems that support: 

-  3D acquisition of photo\-realistic artefact models 

-  web\-based interactive visualisation software 

-  AR apps 

 The research is also underpinned by a 3D algorithm that automates fragment joining \(developed pre\-2016 at Birmingham University\). 

 The original motivation for the research was to enable virtual access to, and virtual reconstruction of, the many thousands of cuneiform tablets and fragments that are distributed across international collections. Prior to joining Keele, Woolley led the original seed\-funded digitisation research at Birmingham \(published in the first paper on 3D\-acquisition of cuneiform SPIE.2001.4298.103\-10\) and was co\-investigator on two Assyriological and Archaeological Leverhulme Trust awards, evolving collaborative reconstruction. Following Woolley’s arrival at Keele \(2016\), an international interdisciplinary collaboration \(Computer Science: Woolley, Nottingham Ningbo NVIDIA Lab, China: Ch’ng; Electronic Engineering: Manchester Met: Collins; Assyriology: Institut für Archäologische Wissenschaften, Goethe\-Universität Frankfurt, Germany: Gehlken\) started work on the wider technologies that form this impact case and established The Virtual Cuneiform Tablet Reconstruction \(VCTR\) Project and accompanying website \( [virtualcuneiform.org](https://virtualcuneiform.org/)\). 

 Cuneiform script is one of the earliest systems of writing, used in Mesopotamia and beyond for over 3000 years, from c. 3000 BCE. Made from handheld clay ‘tablets’ \( **3.1**\) using a reed stylus to form wedge\-shaped impressions, the tablets were *the* original portable information technology \( **3.2**\). Many thousands of tablets and fragments are held in museum archives and collections worldwide. Few of these artefacts are on display and access is limited, even to Assyriological scholars. Where artefacts are on display, only one side of the writing is usually visible. 

 The epic of Atrahasis \(a creation and flood story predating Judæo\-Christian texts\) is one of the most significant examples of Mesopotamian literature \( **3.3, 3.4**\). For over fifty years, one fragment of the third and final cuneiform tablet of the epic, held in Geneva, had been believed to join with another held in London. However, due to their 1000 km separation, the join had never been physically tested \( **3.4**\). In 2017, the team acquired 3D models of both fragments \(using their photogrammetric acquisition system \( **3.5**\)\) and verified and evidenced the match via the automated virtual join algorithm \( **3.3, 3.4**\). 

 The technologies developed through this research have achieved significant advances in virtual artefact reconstruction, 3D interactions and low\-cost portable photogrammetric acquisition \(with a synchronised turntable and camera/smartphone supported by an automated processing workflow\) at sufficient resolution for virtual reconstruction, the alternative is costly or immobile, using laser or structured light scanners \( **3.5**\). In addition to joining the Atrahasis tablet fragments, the technology was also used to acquire almost 100 cuneiform tablet fragments from the study loan collection at The British Museum, and for the joining of two pairs. Exemplars of these fragment models are included on the VCTR website gallery via the interactive 3D viewer and in a join interaction \(popularly accessed by schools\). 

 Subsequent research has evolved the visualisation software and added Android and iPhone augmented\-reality apps \( **3.6**\) that allow acquired virtual 3D models \(and related information\) to be viewed, arranged and manipulated. The team is developing an archive of 3D models \(including non\-cuneiform artefact fragments from local and national museums\) as the basis for a range of educational and cultural outreach activities, and working with museums, citizens and scholars to create innovative and interactive designs.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has engaged new audiences, delivered new virtual artefact interactions and reconstructions, provided scholars with a means of quantifying and verifying joins, and has ‘unlocked cuneiform’ by supporting virtual 3D access to artefacts that are not normally accessible without specialised hardware or software. 

 **Impact in virtual artefact interaction and reconstruction** 

 VCTR interactive outputs can support museums to design and curate virtual, physical, augmented and blended reality exhibitions \( **3.6**\) that democratise collections, enable access to artefacts, and provide presence for repatriated and loaned objects. The joining algorithm, incorporated in VCTR, uses a novel algorithm that handles the incompleteness of broken 3D surfaces, which was critical in joining degraded cuneiform tablets. 

  

 Evolving from the interactive 3D viewers the team developed Android and iPhone AR apps to allow virtual museum artefacts to be collected and arranged. This work was inspired by conversations with the Lead Curator of Antiquities at National Museums Liverpool \(World Museum\), who sought a virtual replacement for the Shabti of Padineith whilst it was on loan to the Florence Nightingale Museum. The AR app enables users to interact with artefacts and to view them either as fragments or as reconstructions \( **3.6**\). 

  

 **Impact in Assyriology and archaeology** 

 The research team used the VCTR toolset on artefacts held at The British Museum; Musée d'Art et d'Histoire, Geneva; and National Museums Liverpool. The most significant impact to date is the first remote artefact reconstruction, joining fragments of the famous Atrahasis epic held in Geneva and The British Museum \( **5.2,** **5.7**\). Acquisitions were made using the 3D photogrammetric acquisition systems developed as part of the VCTR toolset \( **3.5**\), one of which was adapted for the large British Museum tablet \( **5.7**\). Other tablet reconstructions are reported in key Assyriological outlets: the Nouvelles Assyriologiques Brèves et Utilitaires \(NABU 2014 \(4\), 119\-120\) and Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale conferences \(“From Uruk to Ur: Automated Matching of Virtual Tablet Fragments” 2016 and 2017: **3.4**\). In addition, joins have been made for flint fragments provided by Bradford University and investigations are on\-going into the joining of archaeological cast fragments from statues lost in antiquity provided by the Katholische Universität Eichstätt\-Ingolstadt in Bavaria \( **5.8**\). 

 Virtualisation and reconstruction of cuneiform tablets has the potential to provide scholars with new, accessible insights into the social, political, religious, scientific and historical aspects of [ ](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/world-history-beginnings/ancient-mesopotamia/a/mesopotamia-article)Mesopotamian culture \( **5.6**\- **5.9**\). The VCTR project has been mentioned on the Ancient World Online \(AWOL\) blog and tweeted by curators at The British Museum and Penn State as well as Harvard and Leiden researchers \( **5.6**\). 

 The VCTR 3D viewer has been successfully integrated into the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative \(CDLI:  [https://cdli.ucla.edu/](https://cdli.ucla.edu/)\), a joint project with UCLA, University of Oxford, and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin \( **5.10**\). The CDLI curates and publishes a searchable international digital repository of cuneiform artefacts, including hand\-drawn sketches, photographs, reflectance transformation imaging views, transcriptions and translations. The VCTR 3D viewer provides an interactive interface designed for artefact manipulation and 3D script reading and has been successfully implemented with VCTR\-derived 3D models into the current CDLI framework \( **5.10**\). Additionally, the latest version of the VCTR 3D viewer will be fully integrated into the new CDLI framework that is currently in development \( **5.10**\). 

 **Engaging new audiences** 

 Cuneiform and virtual reconstruction have been introduced to new audiences locally and globally \( **5.1**\). The work has been published in the media through a 2018 Conversation article \( **5.2**\) \(7,500 reads, including the UK, US, Australia and France\) and republished in the European Union News \(01/03/2018\), reported in a German national newspaper \( **5.3**\), and presented in a German radio documentary \( **5.4**\).  The team has taken the VCTR 3D digital artefacts and exhibits to outreach events including Potteries Museum “Night of Science” \(28.09.18\) \(1600 visitors\), and a Pint of Science talk \(“Virtual archaeology and ancient beer\)” \(21.05.19\) \( **5.5**\). 

 Also, audiences have engaged with the research through the VCTR project website. The software used to link fragments \( **3.3**\) is demonstrated on the website \( **5.1**\), allowing users to virtually join fragments and to experience the difficulties faced in attempting to identify joining surfaces \( **5.1**\). Between 2016 and 2020, the website had an average of 2000 visitors per week \(90.9% are first\-time visitors to the VCTR\), from the UK, Spain, Germany, France and USA \( **5.2**\). 

 Reviews of website analytics showed US schools accessing the website \( **5.1**\). This prompted development of educational resources and the creation of a Schools Workshop \( **5.5**\). The first workshop ran for 147 year 8 pupils at a Staffordshire school \(06.02.19\). Children explored joining cuneiform fragments and other 3D museum artefacts. Students suggested improvements that were incorporated into the evolved VCTR tools and 3D viewer \( **5.6**\). Following the workshop, students reported an improved understanding of 3D models and an increased interest in computer science \(50% for girls and 32% for boys\). 

 Several public engagement and research events were cancelled due to the COVID\-19 outbreak. These included a contribution to an exhibition at National Museums Liverpool; a school engagement event and two interactions at the July 2020 BCS Human\-Computer Interaction Conference Interaction Gallery. However, overall, ambitions were achieved, for example, via contribution at the European Digital Heritage Conference \(November 2020\) \( **3.6**\) and via the development of AR apps and web pages.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In 2005, following external business angel investment, NIRI Ltd was spun\-out by the University of Leeds to commercially develop Professor Russell’s research on nonwovens, creating innovative products. NIRI’s external impact is reflected by the rapid growth of its global client base of SMEs and PLCs \(>450 projects completed for >200 clients\), multiple new product launches and annual sales revenue in excess of \[text removed for publication\]. NIRI’s co\-funded joint ventures have led to market leading products such as SurfaceSkins to combat the ca. 4.1 million cases of healthcare\-associated infections in the EU each year.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by Professor Russell \(Professor of Textile Materials & Technology, University of Leeds\) has focused on the design and manufacturing of nonwoven materials and particularly structure\-property relationships. In a series of papers, underpinning basic research work, Russell examined the fundamental relationships between the structural design of nonwoven fabrics and the associated directional permeability, capillarity and liquid absorption. **\[1,2\]** By studying the effects of controlling fibre arrangement, fibre dimensions and porosity in nonwoven fabrics, it was discovered that liquid handling behaviour in multiple directions could be manipulated, directly impacting fabric performance **\[2,3\]** In 2006, Russell in his capacity as Technical Director at NIRI Ltd working in partnership with engineers at Zelo Creative Ltd further developed understanding of the liquid handling behaviour of volatile liquids \(alcohols\) stored within nonwoven fabrics, to control 3D transport within the internal structure and minimise the evaporation rate. This led to the design of a new type of multilayer fabric/polymer film composite capable of retaining and internally distributing, large volumes of alcohol\-based antibacterial fluid, for the purpose of killing pathogenic bacteria on contact. The development work led to a family of international patent applications produced by Russell and the team, including: Surface Mountable Delivery Device, US 2007135424\(A1\), 29 Nov 2007; Liquid or gel delivery devices US20180169281A1; Delivery device US20150117932A1 and US9867891B2. The research and development culminated in the commercial development and international launch of SurfaceSkins products, a range of patented hand hygiene devices containing EN1500 alcohol and other actives that enable on\-contact, self\-disinfection of door push plates in hospitals.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Following external financial investment from two business angels, NIRI Ltd was set up in 2005 as a University of Leeds spin\-out company to commercialise research by Professor Russell leading to development of new nonwoven products. As co\-founder of the Company, Russell was seconded by the University from start\-up to act as NIRI’s Technical Director and assist with the Company’s growth \(50% FTE from 2005\-2018 and then 20% FTE from 2018 onwards\). From start\-up, the Company has grown a global client base of 200\+ SME’s and PLCs, has completed over 450 projects and is achieving annual revenues in excess of \[text removed for publication\]. **\[A\]** The company employs 20 highly qualified staff and has been profitable from the first year of trading. In 2017, the Company moved to a dedicated 10,000 sq ft. site in Leeds and in 2018 established its first overseas division \(NIRI LLC\), based in the USA. NIRI’s technical consultancy services have directly enabled numerous SMEs and global PLCs to launch improved or new products, growing their market share and positively impacting consumers. NIRI's consultancy work is conducted under strict confidentiality and therefore a full list of companies is not included, however, the international client base directly benefitting from NIRI's products and services include the defence industry, food and beverage, hygiene and the healthcare sectors, as well as large consumer products and retail brands **\[B\]**. 

 In addition to growing a successful technical consultancy business, NIRI has co\-funded joint ventures with other innovation companies, focusing on commercial product development. One such development directly linked to Russell's underpinning research, as referenced in Section 2, is SurfaceSkins. 

 Up to 80% of infections are known to be transmitted by hands, and SurfaceSkins are designed to self\-disinfect in the time it takes for another user to contact the surface **\[C\]**. The European Centre for Disease Protection and Control \(ECDC\) estimates that ca. 4.1 million patients acquire a healthcare\-associated infection in the EU each year, directly resulting in 37,000 deaths, and contributing to another 110,000 deaths p.a. About 20\-30% of these cases are preventable by better infection and control procedures **\[D\]**. 

 SurfaceSkins technology was designed and developed by NIRI in partnership with industrial design consultants, Zelo Creative Ltd and led to the formation of separate company, Surface Skins Ltd:  [http://surfaceskins.com/](http://surfaceskins.com/). Following recent investment in UK manufacturing facilities, worldwide \[text removed for publication\] have been achieved across Europe, The Middle East, Asia, Australasia and Africa and the supply of SurfaceSkins is underway. **\[E\]** The business employs \[text removed for publication\] people and in 2018, appointed a new CEO to open up international markets. Underpinned by Russell's research on liquid handling behaviour in composite nonwoven fabrics, SurfaceSkins Ltd are a range of innovative hand hygiene devices that help to reduce the transmission of Healthcare Associated Infections \(HCAIs\) in critical areas such as hospitals. The products are compression\-activated self\-disinfecting surfaces that clip\-fit directly on to existing door handles and push plates, delivering antibacterial liquids immediately to the surface on contact. SurfaceSkins are designed to keep the surface free of bacterial contamination and be replaced after 1000 activations or 7 days of use. Since 2014, as a new clinical intervention aimed at reducing transmission, SurfaceSkins have undergone independent clinical testing led by The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, which reported significant reductions in surface contamination. SurfaceSkins significantly reduced bacterial contamination by >90% up to six days in use, compared to existing doorplates used by hospitals. **\[F,G\]** The clinical impact of the product was heightened further by the approximate doubling in the use of alcohol hand gel dispensers by healthcare workers, following the installation of Surfaceskins doorplates in two operating theatres. **\[H\]** Since 2014, a new ‘custom’ Surfaceskins product has also been launched, that gives customers the ability to print hygiene messages, branding or third\-party advertising on to the self\-disinfecting surface to generate an offset income. This has enabled SurfaceSkins to diversify into the food preparation, advertising, bar and restaurant, coffee, dental and cruise ship markets. The strong international interest is reflected by SurfaceSkins winning the prestigious 2019 RISE Innovation award in the USA. **\[I\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 MacAskill’s research on effective altruism led to millions of pounds in donations to charity. It motivated billionaire Ben Delo to pledge over USD500,000,000 to effective charities over his lifetime. The research also had a large influence on setting up the Long\-term Future Effective Altruism Fund, which has paid out more than USD4,000,000 to charitable purposes to this day. MacAskill has also reached a large public audience through several high\-profile podcasts and a TED talk, drawing dozens of people into the effective altruism movement with a commitment to improve human and animal wellbeing. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Between 2015 and 2020, MacAskill and Ord have been carrying out desk research in moral philosophy to answer the most important questions regarding institutional, philanthropic and individual action to maximise impartial welfare. This came in two categories: the foundations of effective altruism, and decision\-making under moral uncertainty. 

 **Foundations of effective altruism**  Effective altruism uses evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others by as much as possible and taking action on that basis. For example: if you want to donate to charity, which charity will do the most good \(impartially considered\), with your donation? Or if you want to pursue a career that has a positive impact on the world, which career paths will have the biggest impact? 

  

 Research carried out by MacAskill between 2015 and 2019, including *The Definition of Effective Altruism* \[1\], *Effective Altruism: Introduction* \[2\], and *Understanding Effective Altruism and its Challenges* \[3\] further developed and defined the concept of ‘effective altruism’. This research enabled improved understanding of what implications these ideas have on contemporary debates in shaping altruistic actions to maximise impartial welfare. His research has helped distinguish effective altruism from related concepts, like utilitarianism, show how morally ecumenical effective altruism is, and respond to common misconceptions about effective altruism, such as that it is unable to account for ‘systemic change.’ 

  

 **Decision\-making under moral uncertainty** 

 Second, decision\-making under moral uncertainty. Very often we are uncertain about what we ought, morally, to do. So how should we make decisions in the face of such uncertainty? This is a crucial theoretical issue for someone who is engaged in the project of effective altruism because it impacts so heavily on the question of *cause\-prioritisation*: if you want to do the most good, should you try to improve the health of the world’s poorest people, try to reduce the risk of 

 civilizational catastrophe from climate change, or do something else? One’s answer to this question will depend on fundamental moral issues, like how to value the interests of future generations against the present generation. We don’t, currently, know the answers to those questions. But we still need to act, despite our uncertainty. The theory of decision\-making under moral uncertainty allows us to make more rational and reasoned decisions, despite that uncertainty. 

  

 Between 2015 and 2020, MacAskill and Ord generated a novel account of how correctly to make decisions under moral uncertainty, as outlined in the following works: *Moral Uncertainty* \[4\] *, Statistical Normalization Methods in Interpersonal and Intertheoretic Comparisons* \[5\], and *Practical Ethics Given Moral Uncertainty* \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of this research falls into two main areas: \(1\) public policy, law and services; \(2\) understanding, learning and participation. 

  

###  Diverting institutional philanthropic resources towards more effective causes 

 MacAskill’s research on effective altruism between 2015 and 2019 has influenced the work of NGOs and other organisations by directing philanthropic resources towards more effective causes. Key examples of these are listed below: 

  

-  MacAskill’s research on effective altruism \(especially research item 1\) led several philanthropists, including billionaire Ben Delo, to direct their donations towards charities working in the field of effective altruism. \[A\] Ben Delo has, as a result of MacAskill’s research, joined the Giving Pledge in 2019 and committed to donate the majority of his wealth to long\-term oriented effective altruistic causes. \[B\] Effective Giving UK, who advise Ben Delo, state: “Based on Prof. MacAskill’s research, our advisee and the UK’s youngest self\-made billionaire, Ben Delo, pledged to donate the majority of his wealth \(over USD500,000,000\) to work to safeguard future generations and protect the long\-term prospects of humanity. In Mr. Delo’s Giving Letter, he explicitly cites Prof. MacAskill’s work on effective altruism \[...\] as influential to his giving strategy.” Ben Delo learned about MacAskill’s unpublished work through having personal conversations with him. On the Giving Pledge website, Delo states, “My approach is inspired by philosopher William MacAskill and the effective altruism movement, which promotes the use of reason and evidence when deciding how best to help others \[...\]. In short, I believe that all lives are valuable, including those of future generations.” \[A\] 

-  After MacAskill’s research on effective altruism was featured on the Making Sense Podcast with Sam Harris, \[C\] Harris decided to pledge 10% of his personal earnings as well as USD3,500 of the organisation’s income to effective charities, by signing the Giving What We Can Pledge. \[D, page 348\] The podcast has approximately 1,000,000 downloads per episode. 

-  Based on his research, MacAskill advised the Centre for Effective Altruism in establishing a fund for individual donors, directed to the long\-term future. The Centre for Effective Altruism is an Oxford\-based charity working in support of the effective altruism community in bringing about positive changes in how we improve the world. MacAskill co\-founded the organisation in 2011. The Executive Director of the Centre for Effective Altruism said: “MacAskill’s research was \[sic\] vital input in establishing the Long\-Term Future Fund.” \[E\] The Long\-Term Future Fund has raised more than USD4,800,000, of which over USD4,100,000 was paid out between March 2017 and November 2020 for charitable purposes. \[F\] 

###  Diverting lay public resources towards more effective causes 

 MacAskill and Ord’s research has contributed to enhancing understanding of issues in effective charity and decision\-making on the benefits of giving to evidence\-based charities. He has stimulated public interest and engagement in altruistic decision\-making, increased awareness of these areas and challenged norms in the area of effective ways to improve welfare. Below are some of the key examples of how this has been achieved. 

  

-  In April 2018, MacAskill argued the moral importance of the long\-term future in a TED talk on the concept of effective altruism \[A, B, C\], released on the TED website. \[G\]The talk has been watched almost 2,000,000 times and has been picked up by popular news and public intellectuals, including Max Tegmark, famous author, physicist, cosmologist and machine learning researcher on Twitter. Tegmark writes, “This was one of my favorite 2018 TED talks: let's not only do good but pick our battles wisely\!” \[G\] 

-  MacAskill presented his research on moral uncertainty \[research items 4, 5, 6\] on popular podcasts over the period 2015\-2019, including the 80,000 Hours podcast \(circa 26,000 downloads\), The Tim Ferriss Show, Very Bad Wizards, and the AI Alignment Podcast.\[H\] Some of these appearances popularised MacAskill’s research, and led to changes in the audience’s donation behaviours and careers \- such as a survey respondent starting an MPhil in a related field after listening to a podcast of MacAskill’s on Moral Uncertainty. \[L\] 

-  MacAskill encouraged people to join the effective altruism movement, and to dedicate more of their time and money towards effective charity. In a survey by the Effective Altruism Forum of their members in 2019, respondents were asked how they had first heard of effective altruism, 72 people \(63% of 115 open comments\) cite MacAskill’s podcast appearances, and 4 people \(5% of 76 open comments\) cite MacAskill’s TED talk \[I\]. The mean donation to effective charities per survey respondent was USD6,407 \(calculation: USD16,100,000 total donations \[J\] among 2513 respondents \[K\].\) One of the survey respondents who was influenced by reading MacAskill’s work said “I now donate 10% of my income” to charities and causes “such as the Against Malaria Foundation and efforts to reduce existential risk.” \[L\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Evaluations that have demonstrated improvements in outcomes following post\-stroke exercise programmes have guided the development of the HELP \(Health Enhancing Lifestyle Programme\) Hampshire Stroke Clinic, a community\-based collaboration between the University of Winchester, Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust \(HHFT\), and Hobbs Rehabilitation \(independent neuro\-rehabilitation service\). The clinic shifts focus from General Practice identifying and recruiting patients to exercise referral schemes to HHFT and their acute stroke unit, Transient Ischaemic Attack \(TIA\) clinic and Early Supportive Discharge \(ESD\). The evidence highlighted in this case study illustrates how our research has impacted on the stroke care pathway of HHFT. Such impact has national relevance as this is similar to other NHS trusts. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In the UK, there are over 100,000 strokes each year, and over 1.2 million stroke survivors. Once a stroke patient has been discharged from the care of the NHS, there are limited opportunities for people to engage in accessible and affordable lifestyle behaviour change initiatives in the community, despite robust evidence supporting the benefits of post\-stroke exercise participation, as demonstrated by **Faulkner** and colleagues **\(3.1\-3.4\)**. 

 Faulkner has undertaken randomized controlled trials, in collaboration with local healthcare providers, that have demonstrated: 1\) the short\- and long\-term benefit of stroke/TIA patients engaging in exercise programmes soon after diagnosis; 2\) the economic importance of secondary stroke prevention programmes; and 3\) optimal blood pressure assessment procedures for stroke survivors. 

1.  **Research evidence regarding the benefit of exercise soon after stroke/TIA** 

 Faulkner and colleagues have provided evidence that 8\- to 12\-weeks of at least twice weekly aerobic and/or resistance training can improve cardiovascular disease risk profile **\(3.1\-3.2\)** and quality of life **\(3.3\)** when engaging stroke/TIA patients in exercise programmes within seven days of diagnosis. Faulkner’s research showed large reductions in blood pressure \(BP\) **\(3.1\-3.2\)**, and improvements in blood lipid profile and measures of body composition **\(3.1\)**. The benefits reported immediately following the intervention were maintained up to 12\-months after the exercise programme **\(3.1\)**. These individuals were also shown to have fewer hospital admissions and strokes, and reduced risk of total mortality, when compared to those individuals who did not engage in such a programme, within three and a half years of stroke diagnosis **\(3.4\)**. 

1.  **Research into economic impact of secondary stroke prevention programmes** 

 Faulkner demonstrated the economic benefit of secondary prevention exercise and education programmes on stroke/TIA patient hospital costs **\(3.4\)**. The study was the first to demonstrate that over a three\-and\-a\-half\-year follow\-up period, the costs associated with stroke/TIA patient hospital admissions were 141% higher in those individuals who did not participate in an exercise and education programme soon after stroke/TIA diagnosis. 

1.  **Winchester’s research into optimal BP assessment procedures** 

 Faulkner and colleagues assessed the short\- and longer\-term changes in BP with stroke patients lying down and in a fasted\-state **\(3.1\-3.2\)**. However, BP is measured in differing postures and fasting states within clinical settings \(hospitals, GP practices\) according to a variety of environmental and situational factors. Mitchelmore \(PhD student, University of Winchester; 2015\-2019\), **Faulkner** and **Jobson** demonstrated that when measuring BP in stroke patients and an older, healthy population group, it should be assessed in a fasted state, regardless of posture \(seated/supine\), to optimise the accuracy and reproducibility of collected data **\(3.5, 3.6\).** Accordingly, the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic assesses patients at screening and follow\-up assessments in a fasted state.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research of **Faulkner** and colleagues **\(3.1 to 3.6\)** has underpinned the creation of the **HELP** \(<ins> **H**</ins>ealth <ins> **E**</ins>nhancing <ins> **L**</ins>ifestyle <ins> **P**</ins>rogramme\) **Hampshire Stroke Clinic;** an accessible, low\-cost service to community\-dwelling individuals living with stroke **\(5.1\)** which has had a substantial impact on: i\) people, by improving health outcomes for stroke patients and facilitating greater opportunities for volunteers, ii\) reconfiguring the pathway for stroke referrals within the NHS \(HHFT\), and iii\) practice services \(e.g., Hobbs rehabilitation processes and research focus\). 

 **Impact on patient beneficiaries** 

 The HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic is recognised as one of the top 100 University programmes that are ‘saving lives and keeping us healthy’ **\(5.2\)**. The HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic collects robust data on stroke outcomes. Substantial improvements in BP have been evidenced, with attendees to the clinic experiencing meaningful reductions in BP from when they start \(146/82 mmHg\) to when they complete the programme \(135/79 mmHg\) **\(5.3\)**. This is impactful when considering that a BP ≤140/85 mmHg is associated with up to a 41% reduction in experiencing future strokes \(Weiss et al., 2017, doi:10.7326/M16\-1754\). Engagement with the exercise programme has resulted in attendees showing improvements in their functional abilities \(e.g., balance, walking\), psychosocial outcomes \(anxiety, depression, confidence\) and quality of life have also been reported **\(5.3\)**. In support of these positive impacts, the Stroke Association have reported that: 

 *‘The programme is having a real impact on the lives of our service users and has both physical and psychosocial health outcomes. They feel that the support from ward to the clinic is 'seamless' and for service users whose strokes were a few years ago, this new programme has given a renewed boost to their recovery and a feeling that they can continue to make improvements.’* **\(5.4\)** 

 The impact of this clinic on the quality of life of service users and their families has also been significant, as evidenced through patient testimonials. For example, this patient highlighted numerous positive impacts: 

 *‘When I first started attending, I was barely out of my wheelchair. Afraid to walk, as I was not at all confident to walk. But now with exercises for core muscles, co\-ordination, agility, balance, strength, making us more aware, I'm able to walk with my own two legs with a lot more confidence’* **\(5.5\)** 

 **Impact on referral configuration** 

 Prior to the commencement of the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic, the referral of stroke patients to Winchester City Council’s Active Lifestyle’s Exercise Referral Scheme, primarily from GP practices, was limited, with approximately 20 patients being referred annually to community, leisure\-centre based exercise programmes. The HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic has instigated significant service reconfiguration for the referral of patients to community stroke rehabilitation programmes by developing a new pathway of secondary care via HHFT, and in particular the Hyper\-acute stroke unit, TIA clinic and ESD team **\(5.6, 5.7\)**. Although the Clinic also receives referrals from GP practices, with 16 GP practices referring patients to the clinic in the first year of the Clinic \(March 2019 to March 2020\), the programme quadrupled \(n = 80 patients\) the number of annual stroke survivors engaging in community exercise. As of June 2020, and due to COVID\-19, the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic commenced the delivery of virtual online, practitioner led exercise classes. Accordingly, individuals newly diagnosed with stroke during COVID\-19 are also able to access the services of the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic. 

 **Impact on voluntary sector** 

 Based on the success of recruiting local stroke patients to the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic, the Stroke Association approached the University of Winchester to create a new stroke support group **\(5.4\)**. Accordingly, in November 2019, the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic and Stroke Association started to provide additional opportunities for community\-dwelling stroke survivors \(approx. 20\-30 people\) to help improve patients’ communication, rebuild confidence and independence, and help people rebuild their life after stroke. Students \(Sports Science, Physiotherapy\) from the University of Winchester and other Higher Education Institutions \(Solent University; University of Portsmouth\) are afforded opportunities to enhance their learning whilst supporting the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic. Their involvement provides an opportunity to foster the application of knowledge and aids in developing and applying their learned skills, whilst facilitating confidence\-building and an opportunity to improve communication skills when dealing with members of the public **\(5.8\)**. In addition to enhancing learning opportunities, this link is shaping the views of future generation allied health practitioners on after stroke care. Impacting upon the Physiological Society and Guild HE report on ‘Sport & Exercise Science Education: Impact on the UK Economy’ **\(5.9\)**, the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic was one of only three \(of 29\) University case studies that was deemed to provide ‘benefits to the public purse’. 

 **Impact on independent neuro\-physiotherapy provider** 

 Hobbs Rehabilitation is the largest independent rehabilitation provider in the UK. The HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic has influenced Hobbs’ activity by: i\) facilitating opportunities for them to deliver group\-based exercise classes in the community as a part of a collaborative programme, and ii\) encouraging them to engage in research activities to help further their knowledge, understanding and application of physical therapy for patients with neurological conditions **\(5.10\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Drawing on their research into refugee resettlement as a two\-sided matching problem, Alexander Teytelboym, with David Delacretaz and Will Jones, have developed and deployed software designed to optimise resettlement outcomes for refugees. The software package, titled *Annie*™ MOORE, is the first developed for this purpose. This software has been used by HIAS, a US resettlement agency \( [www.hias.org](http://www.hias.org/)\), since May 2018 for all of their refugee placements. Since its launch, *Annie*™ has assisted in the resettlement of 1,105 employable refugees, contributing to a statistically and economically significant improvement in the employment outcomes of refugees and in the quality of refugee integration in their local communities. In addition, it has enabled HIAS to improve the efficiency of its operations and increased the agency’s capacity to handle cases. The researchers are in ongoing discussions with other agencies, including the UK Home Office, about the potential use of *Annie*™ to speed the resettlement process in their jurisdictions.

1.  **Underpinning research** *\(indicative maximum 500 words\)* 

 Research by Teytelboym, with Delacretaz, Jones and others, employ insights from market design to derive mechanisms for refugee resettlement that can lead to improved outcomes for both the refugee families and the communities in which they are settled. 

 The underlying premise, that refugee resettlement may be modelled as a two\-sided matching problem, is set out in papers by Teytelboym with Jones. Two distinct matching problems arise in refugee resettlement: the matching of refugees to states **\[R1\]**, and the allocation of refugees to localities within states **\[R2\]**. From an ethical and an economic welfare perspective, both problems require that the preferences of refugees, states, and local communities are considered. The work by Jones and Teytelboym show how two\-sided matching theory can provide an allocation mechanism that takes into account refugees preferences as to where they would like to go, and the views of states or local communities as to which refugees they feel most capable of hosting. 

 The refugee resettlement problem involves a number of complications that do not arise in other contexts in which matching mechanisms are frequently used – for example, matching children to public schools, or junior doctors to hospitals. Refugees are resettled as families \- rather than individuals \- and families are of different sizes, with varying needs and integration requirements. Localities vary also in the range and level of services they can provide. Research by Delacretaz and Teytelboym, with Kominers \(Harvard University\) addresses these additional complications. It builds on classic matching models to develop a new framework incorporating multidimensional constraints that reflect refugee families’ needs for multiple units of different services, as well as the service capacities of local areas. Their starting point is the case in which the refugee preferences are not elicited explicitly, but rather the quality of the match is inferred from observable data such as the local employment rate. This basic framework was developed in 2016 when Kominers was a Visiting Fellow at INET, University of Oxford and Delcretaz, then a PhD student at the University of Melbourne, also visited Teytelboym at Oxford. In their working paper **\[R3\]**, they show that in this case the optimization problem is equivalent to a multiple multidimensional knapsack problem \(MMKP\). In subsequent work, the analysis is further refined and extended to incorporate the stated preferences of refugee families and also the priorities of localities into the MMKP **\[R4\]**. Several matching design approaches are analysed that balance the competing objectives of refugee welfare, respect for localities priorities, and strategy\-proofness.  In other work, Teytelboym and co\-authors investigate whether the efficiency and stability properties of the outcome would be improved by relaxing capacity constraints of localities in ways that are compatible with current US resettlement rules **\[R5\]**. 

 Collaborating with Trapp, Martinello, Andersson, and Ahani, Teytelboym combined his expertise in matching models with skills in integer optimisation methods, machine learning and coding to move the analysis from theory to practice **\[R6\]**. Integer optimisation methods are used to generalise MMKP to allow for several additional constraints that are important in practice, for example a minimum average family size constraint for different localities. Following the approach of **R3**, the quality of the match is measured by the probability of employment for the newly arrived refugee and this is estimated from past data using machine learning methods. These techniques are integrated into a software package, Annie™ MOORE \(Matching and Outcome Optimization for Refugee Empowerment\], based on open\-source technologies. It is designed to identify data\-driven, optimized matches between refugees and local affiliates while respecting refugee needs and affiliate capacities.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 According to data released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \(UNHCR\) of the estimated 1,200,000 refugees in need of resettlement globally, \(i.e. permanent relocation to another country\) in 2018, only 55,692, just 4.7%, were actually resettled. Moreover, evidence shows that socioeconomic outcomes of refugees depend strongly on the quality of the match with the first community they are resettled to. The pioneering software Annie™ MOORE has been shown to increase the capacity of refugee agencies to match the needs of refugees and their families \(e.g. child care or language support\) with the service capacities of hosting communities \(e.g. housing or places in training programmes\), thereby significantly improving socioeconomic outcomes for the resettled refugees and their communities. 

 **Impact on Resettlement Agencies and Refugees** 

 Annie™ MOORE was developed by Teytelboym et al. in collaboration with HIAS, one of nine US refugee resettlement agencies. By identifying data\-driven, optimized matches between refugees and local affiliates which take account of refugee needs and community capacities, Annie™ increases the probability of a successful first match. Back\-testing using HIAS data on the 496 refugees it resettled during 2017 indicates that using Annie™ to identify matches would have increased the proportion of refugees obtaining employment within a 90\-day window by between 22% and 38% **\[R5, p3\]**. Commenting on these results, a member of the HIAS team observed that *‘the program significantly improves the chances of the refugees settling into, and therefore likely becoming a benefit to, the wider community’* **\[E1\]**. HIAS report that the early results of using Annie™ increased the likelihood of employment by at least 20%, in line with the research estimates **\[E2, p 12.\]**. 

 The subsequent roll\-out of Annie™ followed in 2018. Since then it has helped HIAS to resettle over 1,105 refugees who did not previously have any ties with the U.S., and the evidence shows a broad range of benefits. The Associate Vice\-President, U.S programs, at HIAS, observed ‘ *Many people think that once a family has resettled, they continue to be supported by the government…but in the United States this simply isn’t true. Refugees are expected to obtain employment very quickly and start supporting themselves. This technology has been key to helping our regional offices connect relatively straightforward resettlement cases with new homes and communities where they are more likely to thrive in their jobs’* **\[E1\]**. In addition, Annie™ has reduced the fraction of refugee families who are placed in communities which cannot provide services to support them, significantly improving the quality of refugee integration in their communities. The HIAS CEO states that Annie™ has *‘completely eliminated any refugee\-affiliate service mismatch \(for example with respect to single parent support or language support\)’* **\[E3\]**. 

 Finally the software has enabled HIAS itself to streamline and improve their processes and, by extension, add value to the broader American refugee resettlement programme. As more refugees are able to get into employment more quickly and become self\-sufficient, the return on government funding for arriving refugees dramatically increases. HIAS’ Associate Director for Pre\-arrival, observes *‘I now spend 80% less time on routine matching, and can focus my time and energy on the more difficult cases, such as those with significant medical conditions, ensuring that their placement is as good as possible’* **\[E3\]**. 

 HIAS sees considerable potential to expand the use of Annie™, and is currently negotiating with several other US resettlement agencies about their adoption of this software **\[E3\]**. HIAS is hopeful that the forthcoming change in the US administration, coupled with progress in controlling the coronavirus pandemic, will accelerate this process 

 **Ongoing Impact** 

 A report by the UK Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration \(2017\-8\) highlighted the unacceptable length of time it takes to settle refugees within the UK, and recommended that the Home Office ‘ *improve the geographical matching process*’ of refugees in the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme. In its response to the report, the Home Office committed to *‘consider whether there are any changes that could be made to make more effective use of the time between a refugee’s acceptance onto the scheme and their resettlement in the UK’* **\[E4, para.4.2\]**. To this end, Teytelboym was invited to present his work on Annie™ at the Home Office in April 2020, though the current pandemic has stalled further development in this area. 

 Presentations of the Annie™ system have also been made by Teytelboym to the US Department of State \(August 2017\), the World Bank \(May 2017\) and the Swedish Ministry of Finance \(April 2018\).  A recent report from the Swedish Equalities Commission recommended the use of statistical matching algorithms to improve the integration of refugees, noting the use of such methods in the US, and referencing the papers by Teytelboym and his co\-authors **\[E5\]**. 

 Since its launch, Annie™ and the underlying research has been the subject of many media articles and blog posts, including in The Atlantic, Forbes, and Financial Times, helping to shape the discourse around refugee resettlement **\[E6\]**. In November 2020, a case study of Annie™️ MOORE: Increasing Employment of Resettled Refugees using Machine Learning and Optimisation was featured in the OECD’s Observatory of Public Sector Innovation report “ *Focusing on the Overlooked”*. **\[E7, 12\-13\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Omiunu’s research under the auspices of Afronomicslaw.org, where he is an Editor, has empowered and amplified youths and NGO groups, respectively, as stakeholders in Africa’s economic governance processes. Notably: 

 1 Omiunu led a team of African youths who designed a development\-focused Covid\-19 model trade clause in a United Nations toolkit for international trade negotiators. 

 2 Omiunu’s research shaped the agenda for an intergenerational debate on economic integration between African youths and high\-level political actors at the Tana High\-Level Forum – the leading annual peace and security forum in Africa. 

 3 Omiunu’s research was foundational in establishing a consortium of African NGOs pressing for economic justice in Africa.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Three strands of Omiunu’s research underpin the impacts in this case study. 

 **\(1\) CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS AS A HINDRANCE TO THE PARTICIPATION OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES IN THE GLOBAL TRADING SYSTEM** 

 A special issue publication edited by Omiunu et al. \[R1\] critically explored capacity constraints militating against Africa’s participation in international economic relations. The research, which emanated from an international conference co\-organised by Omiunu \( [*The AfIELN Biennial Conference – Diversity of Scholarship and Representation*, 12 July 2019](https://www.afronomicslaw.org/2019/07/12/the-afieln-biennial-conference-diversity-of-scholarship-and-representation)\), identified an often\-overlooked nexus between knowledge creation and curation in the international economic law \(IEL\) discipline and Africa’s marginality in global economic governance \[R1: 3\]. 

 In R1, Omiunu et al. identified how the marginalisation of African perspectives and voices in the IEL discourse is inimical to African countries’ effective participation in the global economic discourse \[R1: 7\]. 

 Given the circumstances, Omiunu et al. advocated for informal spaces to consolidate the scholarship, teaching, research, practice and policy relating to IEL in Africa \[R1: 6–9\]. Omiunu et al. highlighted the importance of nurturing future IEL scholars who are appropriately equipped with knowledge relevant to the African continent \[R1: 8\]. The research by Omiunu et al. also emphasised that ‘the early study of IEL is important and critical to constructing the present and future generation of IEL in Africa both as a field of study and legal practice’ \[R1: 6\]. 

 **\(2\) AMPLIFYING AND EMPOWERING AFRICAN YOUTHS IN ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE THROUGH THE AFRONOMICSLAW.ORG ACADEMIC FORUM** 

 Responding to the findings in R1, further research by Omiunu has explored practical and innovative methods to build capacity among a new generation of African youths who are keen to engage with IEL but have limited opportunities to do so due to the issues highlighted in R1. Specifically, Omiunu developed a mentoring programme for African youths focusing on technical issues relating to IEL \(detailed in section 4\). Notably, Omiunu’s research with several youth volunteers participating in the mentoring programme led to the publication of a peer\-reviewed model clause \[R2\] in October 2020. R2 focused on the challenges faced by Global South countries in the multilateral trade system of the World Trade Organization \(WTO\), which have found it difficult to secure much needed personal protective equipment \(PPE\) during the Covid\-19 pandemic. The research connected the shortage in PPE to restrictions invoked by contracting parties under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \(GATT\). More importantly, the research emphasised the adverse impact of these restrictions on developing countries heavily dependent on developed countries for critical medical supplies. The research proposed a model WTO GATT clause that will prevent the use of GATT provisions \(Art. XI:2\(a\); Art. XX\(b\); Art. XXI\(b\)\(iii\) and any other provision of GATT 1994 inconsistent with our proposed clause\) to justify exceptions to restrictions in trade of PPE during a pandemic or any future global public health emergency \[R2: 9–10\]. The recommendations in R2 built on a symposium convened by Afronomicslaw.org, which highlighted salient socio\-economic implications of the Covid\-19 pandemic for Global South countries \[R3\]. The publication of R2 gave the African youths involved an opportunity to contribute their voices to important interventions and debates by stakeholders across the world on how to ‘build back better’ after the Covid\-19 health crisis. Leading this initiative has also highlighted the need for informal supporting mechanisms to introduce young people on the African continent to technical aspects of IEL early on in their academic careers, as recommended by Omiunu et al. \[R1: 6\]. R2 is also a response to the observation by Omiunu et al. in R1 that there must be a commitment from stakeholders to nurture ‘policy experts that strive for innovation in the design and negotiation of African trade agreements’ \[R1: 8\]. As such, the successful publication of R2 demonstrates the potential of African youths to contribute to the technical design of trade rules that affect Africa when given the opportunity. It also provides a step in the right direction to remedy a finding by Omiunu et al. that there is a ‘shortage of personnel with expertise and understanding of the dynamics of international economic relations on the continent; particularly technical, historical and substantive knowledge of the field of IEL in Africa’ \[R1: 8\]. 

 **\(3\) ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL JUSTICE IN AFRICA** 

 Under this strand, Omiunu’s research critically explores the important role of NGOs in exposing corruption by public sector officials in African countries such as in Mozambique, where the highest court in the country overturned a sovereign\-backed debt which was procured through fraud and abuse of due process by government officials in connivance with foreign investors \[R4\]. In R4, Omiunu and Akanmidu focus on underexplored connections between economic justice and dispute resolution in international forums involving African host states. Against the backdrop of recent court decisions in high\-profile disputes involving two African countries, Mozambique and Nigeria, R4 highlights parallels and opportunities for learning, especially as it pertains to the role of African NGOs in holding public officials accountable and exposing odious deals with corrupt foreign conspirators.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **\(1\) TRANSLATING RESEARCH INTO IMPACT: THE ROLE OF AFRONOMICSLAW.ORG** 

 Omiunu is one of four Editors of Afronomicslaw.org, a blog set up in January 2019 to empower marginalised African voices in the economic governance discourse. Omiunu formally joined Afronomicslaw.org in May 2020 as its Lead Editor to spearhead its flagship youth mentorship scheme – the Academic Forum \(the Forum\). Before this, Omiunu had played an instrumental role in setting up the blog in 2019, including coming up with its unique name – ‘Afronomicslaw.’ The primary aim of Afronomicslaw.org is to complement existing forums that analyse, discuss and debate IEL issues related to Africa and the Global South. Using blogs, public webinars and informal mentorship as an advocacy and empowerment strategy, Afronomicslaw.org has significantly amplified Global South perspectives on IEL in a short period. With over 400 high\-quality blog posts published in 2019\-2020 and a daily readership comprising academics, policymakers, legal practitioners and political actors, Afronomicslaw caters to a broad audience. With over 100 unique users visiting the website per day, sometimes rising to an average of 300–450 visitors during special events, Afronomicslaw.org is now synonymous with Global South IEL perspectives within the broader international law community. 

 **\(2\) EMPOWERING MARGINALISED AFRICAN YOUTHS IN ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE THROUGH MENTORSHIP** 

 Under Omiunu’s leadership of the Forum, Afronomicslaw.org has made significant strides. There are 23 volunteers from across Africa \(including Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Nigeria and Uganda\) now signed up as academic representatives on the Forum as of 31 December 2020 \[C1\]. Since its introduction in May 2020, the Forum has grown in popularity \[C2\] due to several accomplishments in a short period, including the publication of R2 and the introduction of a  [four\-month training programme](https://www.afronomicslaw.org/category/academic-forum/report-academic-forums-activities-2020) focusing on general and specific IEL topics of relevance to Africa. Under the guidance of Omiunu, the training programme was initiated and is coordinated by one of the volunteers \(the Forum’s Lead Representative in East Africa – an undergraduate student of Strathmore University Kenya\) \[C3, C4\]. 

 Led by Omiunu, a team of volunteers from the Forum actively participated in designing a model trade clause to mitigate the impact of future global health emergencies on international trade corridors \[R2\]. A team of UN expert reviewers selected R2 in a competitive process for inclusion in a United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific \(ESCAP\) online toolkit for international trade negotiators \[C5\]. This is a remarkable feat achieved by a team comprising four novices in international trade law who, aided by research\-based mentoring from Omiunu, were able to meaningfully contribute to the design of the trade clause. This achievement’s significance is further underscored by the fact that the Forum’s proposal was among only four entries selected from African teams out of 20 proposals accepted in the category for ‘Essential goods/​Import\-Export restrictions’ \[see online toolkit in R2\]. The Forum’s proposal was also the only entry prepared by an African team comprising two or more undergraduate students. 

 More importantly, participation in the mentorship scheme has significantly enhanced the education and career pathways of the students involved. As a result of work on the model clause, the student volunteers received certificates of participation from the United Nations and gained practical insights on how to draft trade clauses \[C6\]. Inspired by this experience, one of the volunteers who participated in the design of R2 reports how involvement with this mentoring scheme aided his application for graduate opportunities in prestigious universities outside of Africa \[C7\]. 

 Omiunu was invited by the Secretariat of the Tana High\-Level Forum on Security in Africa \(THLF\) – the leading annual peace and security forum in Africa – as the sole academic expert on African economic integration to assist in the agenda\-setting for the 2020 THLF event. The theme of the 2020 THLF was the nexus between the African Continental Free Trade Agreement \(AfCFTA\) and peace and security in Africa. Omiunu was further invited to judge and select winning entries for an essay competition – the THLF’s flagship youth empowerment programme designed to foster intergenerational discussions on pressing peace and security issues affecting the African continent. As a result of these invitations, previous work as Editor of Afronomicslaw.org’s Academic Forum and success at the UN Hackathon, the THLF formally approached Omiunu to mentor the three winners of the youth competition ahead of their presentation to high\-level political leaders, including several heads of state. This is the first time in the nine\-year history of the THLF that youth mentoring has been outsourced outside of the THLF’s secretariat, and this was due to Omiunu’s expertise in the area and previous track record with the Forum \[C8\]. 

 **\(3\) IMPROVING PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND LOBBYING POWER ABOUT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL JUSTICE IN AFRICA** 

 Afronomiclaw.org’s expanding reach has benefited important stakeholders involved in championing economic justice causes in Africa, such as the Open Society for Southern Africa \(OSISA\). Notably, Omiunu \(supported by HEIF funding\) initiated and organised Afronomicslaw.org’s first public webinar, which was done in collaboration with the OSISA \[C9\]. The webinar helped OSISA generate public awareness about a significant public interest litigation case – the Mozambique Constitutional Court Decision discussed by Omiunu and Akanmidu in R4. The webinar had over 90 unique viewers from across five continents during the event \(and 90 maximum concurrent views at one point\) \[C10\]. The webinar participants included academics, other Africa\-based NGOs \(including representatives of the NGO – Nweti Mozambique \- that initiated the successful public interest litigation\), journalists, students and members of the general public. This webinar has proved to be an effective strategy for centring African NGOs’ voices working on critical economic justice issues in Africa. In the words of one of the NGO panellists at the webinar organised by Omiunu, ‘I really appreciate the opportunity to talk to everybody, and it’s a great thing for the organisers to have done, and I hope you’ll do it again soon’ \[C11: 32\]. The webinar series is now a staple of Afronomicslaw.org, with subsequent webinar collaborations with important Global South stakeholders, including – UNCTAD, UNDP and South Centre and the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations \[C12\]. 

 Building on the success generated by the webinar, OSF has given Afronomicslaw.org a USD100,000 grant \(10\-2020\) to set up an economic justice network comprising high profile NGOs involved in sovereign debt advocacy in Africa. Achieving the grant money has provided Afronomicslaw and its NGO partners greater lobbying power to design advocacy tools and focused public campaigns to aid future public interest litigation and advocacy on issues of illegally procured debt by African governments \[C13\].
